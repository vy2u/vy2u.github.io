right now I'm still recovering from this
like flu virus II I don't even know all
I know is apparently my body has no
immune system whatsoever I just love
being ill do you know what I mean I
think I've got a flat where every week
now like I'm just hurting right you know
what I've got shit to do so we just have
to do we sound like a man fairly well
but oh and I guess I should probably
just in fact that my hair is now
itty-bitty it's so much sold out I
actually feel like Jordan Lipscomb again
I love it I don't really know why I'm so
excited because I always have short hair
but like this is a shortest I've ever
ever gone and I feel like it's a short
something for a hot minute because my
hair growing I think I was like down
here somewhere and I was like who's this
bitch food my 2017 beauty of favorites
pretty much if you've ever wanted to
know what my like Holy Grail staple
products have been throughout 2017 like
the ultimate of the ultimate you know in
this video with you're watching right
now is for you this is basically full of
makeup skincare and hair care that I
have absolutely like falling in love
with and I like my faves not gonna lie I
found some goodies this year because I
found these this year I'm boss to see
what I can find next year so hey let's
just get to it shall we let's do it
justice hey care low-key one of my
favorite things last item is this logo
so basically because I have short hair I
love to have a lot of like like texture
and I like it to have a lot of volume
and just for it to be like super messy
you know like I don't give up
mmm this product here is so flippin good
so this is the hair by Sam McKnight cool
girl barely their texture mist now I
have tried my fair share of texturizing
mist you know sea salt sprays that kind
of thing and none of them have done what
this does to my hair okay so the reason
why I love this over any texturizer mist
that I've use and trust me I've tried a
few is because this one is a aerosol
sprites oh no a lot of texturizing spray
is calm it as a soar like a liquid form
so they kind of make your hair for a
little bit damp and then for me they try
like a little bit like crunchy and this
where it's an aerosol it just like
sprays a fine powdery mist into your
hair without leaving it feeling like you
know gross AF and the packaging on this
die light matte pink
that yes if you like me and you love to
have a lot of texture in your hair but
you also love to touch your hair a lot
this is for you because it won't make
your hair feel like weird when really
quickly this smell isn't that great kind
of smells a little bit like grass but
because the products so good I'm just
like yeah it's fine so yeah that's that
and I'm pretty sure you can find this on
court Beauty by the way okay so the kind
of last hair product I have to share
with you is some that's very my favorite
way to have my hair is pretty much how
it is now you know like loose of waves
and obviously I want the staff to stay
in you know I'm not going to spend all
that time on my hair for it to just be
like see how so I need something to keep
that style in but again because I
touched my hair a lot I don't may have
to feel like a break you feel me Loreal
Elnett hairspray that means out these
are on a whole new level
like I've tried so many house brace this
year because you know it has Bruce I can
assess it I feel like everyone needs a
good hair spray and honestly half of
them make my hair for like solid I
really don't like that but then you try
Loreal Elnett and like your life's
changed it keeps my style in without
crunchy AF hair it just does the job
this is like the perfect hairspray this
one is a flexible one but honestly like
any of the our Nets are like great not
gonna lie this is definitely one of the
more like expensive hair sprays but like
you're paying for like some good stuff
you know like in this camp this is good
stuff okay one more hair thing now and
it's not product this is a tool this
time you guys always ask me what a hair
color I use and even when I wear my
extensions this is the exact one that I
use now this is one of the Marc Hill
pick a mix a barrel ones and I believe
this is the small one so basically this
is the one where you can like detach and
put on whatever size barrel that you
want it comes with five different ones I
believe five so five yes why we think
which is so good you can create so many
different looks with this like set and
holy crap I have never known a curling
wand to be this hot like this ish gets
so freakin hot so just like be careful
I'm pretty sure it does come with gloves
but you know I live life on the edge I
have actually already burned myself once
with this look about the scarf it curls
my hair so good though where it is so
hot I only have to hold on my hair for
like 4 to 5 seconds or something like
that which is insane it lasts in my hair
really nicely you know with a mixture of
those products is it's obviously one of
the best like curling one
set things that I've ever used I even
have to new me sad I actually think this
is better like this is a lot hotter and
they like cows last on my hair way
longer even as a little Stan look at
that I can like stand him
oh yeah and by the way it is why I used
to do my hair today it just adds really
like soft loose kind of like waves time
for a little bit of skincare now I feel
like skincare is one of those things
that we all can be kind of lazy with but
it's probably one of the most important
steps like ever especially if you wear
makeup I kind of feel like it determines
the way your makeup goes on the
application everything like that
actually the first skincare I'm gonna
talk about is my skin
like the color of it I love myself some
fades out I can't help myself
don't look at my fake time right now
though like it's a little bit gross but
so I'm pretty sure this fake time come
out this year and not like the brand but
like the actual town itself like the
color of it and I don't think I will
ever use another thing turn again well
actually I go between this a loving tan
to be fair but I find myself reaching
for this and the most this is the Bondi
sands town in ultra dark No girls and
boys if you love to be like helot and if
you like to have that like dark turn
ultra dark is the way bullet this town
makes me look so turned like no other
turn has ever done that was so many
times in one sentence but like you get
me right now the only downside to this
town is it's a little bitch to get off
I find myself scrubbing at my skin I
know they do have a toner raisin out
which is really really cool it's
actually pretty good but it's so worth
it guys because this town is just so
good I do just want to say they love and
town in opted art is amazing - it's a
little bit more red in tone compared to
this tan but this one just makes me that
teeny teeny bit darker I just I just
love it it has to go to this I feel like
this year has been the year of fake tan
for me and we're not next thing okay I
love like to glow
you guys know isn't and on a night out
you know when you're wearing that dress
and you know you're showing a little bit
of late a little bit like I love to put
some like glow on my legs you know when
the light shines on it is just like yeah
I'm just I'm so much I used for the
iconic London drops on my leg which by
the way worked a treat but I kind of
felt like I was wasting X it's such a
small pot and I like to use that you
know on my face so I found this this is
the scent repay a finishing pull off as
you can see it does have a tint to it so
it does work a bit better if ever
sealskin otherwise you know you will see
like will we all look a little bit
streaky basically but it has this
amazing gold shimmer through it I've
tried many a glowy body thing this is my
favorite because it's a finishing gloss
was actually like a gloss it kind of
feels like a gloss as well meaning that
it's not full of glitter it's not chunky
it genuinely just looks like gloss like
glow on your skin it looks the most like
real but don't be put off by the fact it
says gloss it's not sticky or anything
or uncomfortable feeling it kind of just
doesn't like sit on the top your skin
will sort of soak in a little bit and it
won't feel sticky or uncomfortable
anything like that it just looks looks
hella good so for all my people out
there who love to be a little bit extra
who love to shine like heads attire who
tried these such a finishing gloss it's
so good okay now for some like face skin
care so I never thought I'd be sitting
here saying that I have fallen in love
with a face wash I've tried so many face
washes and never found one that really
solved like made a difference to my skin
they ever broke me out or made my skin
like so dry because if you didn't know
my skin type is I have like oily skin
like in the t-zone like oily let me tell
you then I sort of break out on occasion
so I want to get rid of excess oils but
half the time things dry out my skin
then I'm gonna clean up blemishes and
half the time things just break me out
and I'm just over here like what do I do
and then this come into my life and that
was it weirdly enough my sister actually
introduced me to this because she had a
really bad like skin session and she
bought this and they made such a
difference to her skin so I was like I
need to jump on that it is the LA
roche-posay effaclar purifying foaming
gel and it's for oily sensitive skin
basically this stuff will cleanse your
skin you know get rid of all the dirt
oils excess makeup whatever is left on
my skin all you know the gross stuff but
it gets rid of all of that without
drying out my skin and it hasn't broke
me out ever since I've been using this
which I mean it doesn't look like I've
used that much to be honest I've only
been using this for the past probably
like three weeks I'll say no it's just
the most gentle but effective cleanser
that I have ever used it's sold in Boots
by the way is a little bit expensive but
it's so worth it
I feel like good skincare stuff you just
have to invest in it you know what I
mean so I've been using this with
another little favor I actually used
this before 2017 but I really gave it
like gave it a go this year like I
use there is the vanity planet like skin
brush set thingy I comment where it's
called but looks like this is basically
this little brush here and it comes with
three different heads all do different
things you have ones and more sort of
cleanser skin one that's more
exfoliating and then one which is a
silicone head which I use literally all
the time
it's made for more stuff like sensitive
skin you can just click it on there is
another speed setting as well okay this
brush with this cleanser you need it in
your life
this cleanses your skin this like
exfoliate some really really like gets
in there you know or kind of makes me
like feel all kind of way he's like you
know when you think about with like the
gross stuff in your pop-pop today not
today saying about today it's so easy as
well I just stand there like BAM skin's
all clear okay no I didn't include this
in here to be able to tell you this but
if you do maybe want to save yourself
some coins this discount code right here
can save you so many percent off which
holy crap 70 this video is not sponsored
in any way shape or form I've had this
discount code for like way over a year
now I say if you do want to use it it's
there but um yeah they're my peeps and
then the very very last skin care item I
don't actually have physically here with
me to show you right now I don't know
what I've done with it and if I've lost
it I'm gonna be like super sad it's got
to be in my room somewhere usually like
two days ago destroyed my life but I
will of course include a cutaway it's
the UM Mario Badescu drying lotion I'm
sure you've probably heard about this to
be fair it's basically a little pot with
pink powder at the bottom and then
liquid on top you don't mix them
together all you do take a cotton bud
put it right in like dip it right to the
pink powder and then you apply this pink
powder to any like blemishes that I've
just like appeared on your face
cuz you know spots think they can just
like come whenever they want and it's
totally cool but if you know is it just
me right but you always get a breakout
overnight the day before the most like
important event of your life it's just
the most annoying thing ever
oh well play me like this again this is
the best like the quickest spot clear
and treatment I have like ever used I
put the stuff on and I sleep with it
overnight
not even joking I wake up in the sport
like pretty much gone it's in breaking
set for them huge like freaking
breakouts that just come from nowhere
like a room your life basically this is
wanna see what you need I would never
use like anything ever again like ever
I've gone through two holes of this this
year and I'm definitely gonna continue
in 2018 in my opinion 2017 is definitely
been a years had so many amazing makeup
products but is it just me there's been
so many flops I was actually going to
include my disappointments as well in
this but I thought I'm gonna keep this
my favorites in the next year I'll do
like a full face of products that I
don't like or something like that if you
guys want to see that let me know okay
so I don't know about you but I actually
found it kind of hard to find a
foundation this year that I absolutely
loved I think this year I went for a
phase where the foundations that weren't
for my skin type I loved therefore I
didn't love it that much does that make
sense so I have my favorite kind of
everyday foundation and then I have more
of that like you know I don't - don't
freakin move everyday foundation I have
to give it to these two here now there
is - because keeping it real I switch
between them both sometimes I mix them
one is drugstore one is high-end so the
drugstore one is the Mable link I hate
myself
it's the maybelline superstay 24 hour
full coverage foundation I couldn't
really like get onto this at first and
then the more I used it the more I
freaking loved it
reasons why this is so good one is
drugstore it's affordable it's really
really easy to get hold of secondly the
coverage on this oh my god for a
drugstore foundation I've never known
anything to have like this kind of
coverage I'm like an all-or-nothing kind
of go I'll wear like no makeup at all or
I have like full be like full glam on
also it lasts a nice amount of time on
my skin now don't get me wrong I still
need to like touch up with this you know
I still got oily as I do with like any
foundation I've ever used but I can wear
this for like five six hours and then
the oils will start to come free whereas
like normally it's like free or fall it
gives me them extra few hours I don't
know for the price of this I think in
the UK it's like 9 10 pounds something
like that which is so good it's really
really good if you're into full coverage
you know full face of makeup solve
makeup you will love this just like I do
and then the other one is the Makeup
Forever
Ultra HD invisible cover stick
foundation I honestly think makeup
forever are one of the best brands for
skin makeup their skin stuff is in sane
now I'm not gonna lie this to be fair
would probably be better for someone
with more drier
skin so for all my dry skin Queens out
there you're gonna love this I ever seen
of dry skin I have oily skin and I still
use this the only thing for me is
obviously but do get like oh you live
with that I just have to make sure I
said it well and bring some powder with
me but does this stuff look good on your
skin like my skin looks like airbrush
with this stuff really does make your
skin look HD it's that good it's that
good the coverage on this amazing as
well I love it I'm pretty sure this is
like my third tube of this I know
make up forever of babes and keep
topping me up as well and I'm just
that's my little heart so these are my
like go-to so every day I know they're
like a bit full coverage for every day
but that's just like I said what I like
I'm all or nothing and then okay okay
this foundation right here this is
probably my favorite foundation I have
discovered and I've put on my face in
2017 the reason why I say this is
because as the coverage I like it lasts
well on the skin you know it works on my
skin type and it looks amazing on the
skin there are three things if a
foundation can do them things I'm sold
it is the Marc Jacobs remarkable
foundation this is incredibly a little
bit sad but it is expensive I think it's
almost 40 pounds I'm buying a foundation
from Harrods like that for me is when
you know but it's so damn good I'm not
gonna lie if a foundation is past the
third power mark I'm like do I need you
but you know what where this is so good
I I can't even gonna say this but I
don't even mind that it's so expensive
if it covers everything it is not gonna
move off your face like it's just not it
is the perfect like event makeup just
whenever you want your makeup to stay on
and look bomb calm this is the one you
need I'm sorry first of them the
packaging is really really nice as well
it's in a really like heavy glass bottle
it doesn't come with a pump though it's
the only thing about it comes with this
weird like spoolie thing here I wish it
was a pump but at the same time I don't
mind this if you're a little bit bougie
or you don't mind you know splashing a
little bit
check out the Marc Jacobs for sure so
I'm a concealer now if you watch my
makeup tutorials you probably know
what's coming to be honest because I use
them all the freaking time I have these
two here now heart-shaped eight to be
honest speaks for itself I'm not gonna
like spend time on this
everyone and their mums and their
aunties and their uncles and
18th cause only loves this everything
you want to consider to do this does and
every way you want to consider to look
this has that so yeah heart-shaped ape
definitely is of course probably in
everyone's 2017 favorites this one to be
fair is probably like quite known as
well but it is drugstore so I do want a
shower
it's the Maybelline fit me concealer
this one is in 20 this reminds me a lot
of the NARS radiant creamy concealer by
the way I actually think it's pretty
much a dupe for it this is way thinner
then heart-shaped eight but I feel like
the coverage is quite similar it blends
out like a dream it has a really really
nice finish obviously where it's thin it
doesn't look too heavy underneath the
eyes it just is everything I would want
from a concealer I think this is the
best drug so on I know the collection
one is really really good as well but it
just for like the color range doesn't
work for me it goes quite like pinky
whereas the Maybelline ones stay more on
that yellow which is exactly what I like
really creamy really blendable every
like freaking description word that
every PE gallon boy uses but for
although this is definitely my most used
concealer of the year for sure and my
most like repurchase - concealer props
to you Maybelline you're doing good
homes you're doing good
and then for powder so I've been using
this I would say probably two months now
the way this powder looks on the skin is
like no other powder that I've ever used
it's the beauty baked well it's really
dirty I'm so gross if you want to like
unsubscribe I won't be offended
yeah the beauty bakery flower powder now
I actually got some of this stuff sent
through from Beauty Bay and I didn't
even know how to feel about its bonus it
was all kind of look looks a little bit
gimmicky if I'm honest but I was in this
like flour bag and like the highlighter
was in like an ice cream pie it was just
a bit like eyes I be like all I can say
is don't be fooled because this this
this stuff in this little pot it's good
stuff it's no miracle product in
controlling your oils or anything like
that
but what it is a miracle in is making
your skin look so smooth I bake with
this I set my entire face with this and
my skin has never looked so like smooth
it just looks okay it's just I don't
have enough hair to have like any more
toy and also it has no flashback I
finally found a powder that smooths out
my skin without flashback because
normally the power is that smooth out
your skin are the ones that contain
silica
just flashes that like a bitch and it
just a mess this is the best of both
worlds and I just love it I'm really
excited to try more stuff from Beauty
bakery in 2017 actually I tried their
liquid lipsticks oh my god the fonder of
them are so good like it doesn't dry out
my lips you know no like freaking Sahara
Desert going on here or like bumhole
lips now really nice I'm excited to see
what else they have because so far so
good from this round what has been for
me the brow brand of the year is that
even a question a hundred percent is
benefit like if you've not tried a
benefit for our product what are you
doing get your ass down to like boots or
like wherever else sells benefit like a
John Louis or like a Devon arms or
something I've tried the pencil I've
tried the pomade both just as good
obviously depends what kind of look
you're going for at the beginning of the
year I'll say I love their cut Brown
which was their pomade a lot more cuz I
was really into that sort of like
defined brow now I try and go for that
more sort of like natural looking brow
like still defined but you know more
sort of like hairy looking and I'd have
to say that precisely my brow pencil is
definitely my favorite brow product from
them everyone out you get the twist up
brow or pencil on one end so you know
you don't have to whip out that
sharpener how good like keeping it real
hair like no one has time for that right
and then you have the spoolie on the
other end so you know you can like comb
everything out it defines my eyebrows
but naturally it just creates the
perfect palette that I'm after is just
so fab it's so fat but it wasn't just
that product I used to get that most of
like hair looking eyebrow it was this as
well so I'm going to include it in to I
discovered this this year and it's
freaking the best thing ever
the Aiko brow gel style and define
tinted gel brow booster so it is just a
brow gel as you can see it has like a
itty-bitty brush is like the perfect
sort of like size to really you know get
onto your brows it has a little bit of
color nothing crazy in there as well but
my favorite thing about it is it sets my
eyebrows in place because you know
sometimes like your brow hairs can go
crazy and end up like flicking down or
flicking up or licking everywhere hit
bar it really grabs onto every single
hair so it makes them stand out so your
brows look even more natural which is
exactly what I need like this is this is
like brow heaven in a little bottle it's
actually like kind of magic eye
got my mom on this stuff it's that good
my mom loves it now as well so when mom
doesn't even wear makeup but she does
the right brows and she loves this back
onto its skin care products notes so I
have another little make up forevers
product here this is their bronzer Pro
bronze fusion I'm pretty sure my color
is in 25l by the way I'm pretty sure the
L means it has a bit of like luminosity
to it like a little bit like glow not
like Lea or anything like that like hell
no it just has like a really nice sort
of Sheen to it can you see that whoa so
not only is this bronzer like the
perfect bronzer II shade I have it on
like my face right now
it has like the perfect amount of
pigment so you don't like dip your brush
like this and then go like this and then
it's just like a splotch like we've all
been there you can really you know like
work the product onto your skin get it
as intense as you like which I love so
there's like room for you know room for
play and it also just gives you this
like healthy like luminosity to the skin
it's really weird like for a bronzer to
do that I just love a Hannah Renee got
me onto this she gets one to a long
makeup because her skin always looks so
good I don't know how she does it but
your skin looks good girl I've been
using this since probably about two
nights a and if like I don't use this I
feel like my makeup just is never good
it's just one of my favorite bronzers
last year it was Matt give me son
this year it's all about the makeup
forever what can I say
I'm actually like game hot thinking
about this picking a favorite
highlighter was just it was just too
hard
I feel like 2017 has been at the year
for highlighters I have so many there
have been so many that it's just so hard
to choose but I think I've managed to
pick two out I couldn't choose one okay
I just couldn't sorry I do just want to
say a lot of you will probably be
surprised that the iconic London drops
are not like in my hand right now
they are my favorite liquid highlighter
and of course they are my 2017 like
favorite liquid highlighter of course
but I just didn't want to include them
in this video because I've mentioned
them in about 20 videos and I don't want
it to become repetitive you guys know I
love them like I mean if you're like a
long-term a little sabi then you would
like know that but yeah just to further
out that I do I do love them high-end
and drug so I just realize this makeup
forever again so let's once it I wish it
was sponsored I got Fred much hit me up
this is their pro light fusion
highlighter I'm pretty sure this is 0-2
maybe it's the it's the gold one either
way even just holding that up you can
already tell that that is gonna be good
just like just can we just like what
sorry when what how why get on my face
right now
cool this is like the perfect shade of
like gold it's not gold where you can
see it on your face but like when the
light hits it it's just like a little
bit of gold if I like highlights for me
i standouts when they just look like
like wet on your skin you know there's
no glitter or anything that you know any
chunkiness it just is pure sheen and
just looks wet on your skin and this is
one of those highlighters for sure okay
so my camera just died so I'm not quite
sure where where I left off talking
about highlight all right I think so
yeah the makeup forever a pearl at
fusion gold highlighter is that okay
this one I mean I haven't really heard
anybody talk about models own as like a
makeup brand let alone talk about this
highlighter in particular and I mean to
be completely honest with you model zone
has never really been a brand that I've
been like oh my god I need to try
products from do you know what I mean
but the fact that this highlighter has
made it into this video so the Laura
come on this is the models own sculpt
and glow highlighter powder in golden
sand zero one so first of all I wasn't
too sure I felt about this it kind of
looks like more of a pinky tone
highlighter which isn't normally my
thing however as soon as you put this on
the skin it doesn't look pink whatsoever
this is another one of those
highlighters that is just pure close
there's no glitter no nothing it just
looks like sheen and wet on the skin
it's incredible model zone I see you
hands like I see you I only recently
discovered this I have never used it
before my channel I don't think a lot of
people know about this and I feel that
more people definitely should I'm
actually wearing this today like should
we just ah like I needed more highlight
but hey I just love it I didn't want to
show you too many this video but just to
cheat a little bit over and do some
amazing highlights as well
Jesse okay so this year I definitely
found quantal colors that work for me I
don't know what it is but on my skin
tone a lot of contour colors come off
way too gray and just look so muddy or
they're just
like really kind of orangey and just
workers up on some wall then to contour
so the contour powder favorite has been
the makeup geek little contour pan in
the color complicated it's a cool medium
so it's cool enough to contour with you
know to create that shadow but it's in
the medium like skins home range so it
suits my skin tone it's just like
perfect but yeah this shade in
particular complicated works perfectly
to me this stuff is how I pigmented by
the way so like neither did the amount I
just take this on a huge foam brush and
then just quickly contour my sinks the
fan brush like does it in like 0.2
seconds I love it and then it's like now
I have perfectly like contoured faith
while it's contoured as I can get my
face I've said this so many times on my
channel but honestly I'm like a living
moon emoji
I like the roundest face ever so I can
just like try to make me look like I
have cheekbones a girl could try finally
found a contour this year that condos in
my face and doesn't look muddy it's like
the perfect formula and then as far as
kind of cream contour goes this for me
is definitely a huge huge favor
I'm not really like a cream contour go I
only really reached for it when I go out
and this one was definitely like my most
reached for like the one I would use and
know that it wouldn't go like muddy or
won't go gross or like mess up my
foundation this is the makeup revolution
ultra pro HD cream contour in
light/medium i mean you can probably see
which one I've used the most right this
shade here is so nice to like add color
back to your skin color code and
consular it's a bit warm to contour but
like it does the job and these free
shades here I use more to kind of
contour I kind of mix it with this
shades so you know it's not so dark it
adds color but also adds a little bit of
shape at the same time which is of
course what you want you know contour to
do they're really really creamy but not
creamy to the point where like it just
blends into nothing and they're super
pigmented see they blend out really
really nicely they don't you know mess
with my foundation underneath and cause
anything to go like patchy and gross you
can also set them in place with bronzes
contours that kind of thing and they
don't go weird as well basically
basically this is just a really really
fab contour kit and it's super
affordable cuz it's makeup revolution
get your little hands on this as we all
know there have been so many eyeshadow
palettes out this year and there's been
so many amazing ones and then I thought
right Jordan if there was one eye shadow
palette you could only use for the rest
of your life and what
it'd be it had to be the Jacqueline Hill
and moth we parlay it just had to be as
you can see mine is like the so day it's
so well loft the reason why I chose this
palette number one the formula of these
eyeshadows is insane they are so
pigmented they blend out like a dream on
the eyeballs and then there is like
every single eyeshadow color that I
would probably want ever on my eyes in
this pile here and you have a mixture of
mattes and shimmers and every single one
is just like amazing that's not one
eyeshadow in here that I wish was
different
it just packs a punch this palette it's
very jaclyn hill i don't know why i'm
about to say this because you know
watching my video but you killed it girl
like this palette is fire I'll do some
swatches for you so let's do some like
shimmer shades first and then here are
some shades oh girl oh my god these are
so good that is why I have to have the
jacket in your morphe palette as like
just one of my favorites this year cuz
it's just been so handy and I've been
reaching for the most and he definitely
been like dabbling into like glares mm
oh I love that work it was on my eye I
just love it I think it's so it's just
you just pick there on your eye and
you're just like that's it complete this
has to be my favorite glare of the year
it's the NYX face and body glitter in
the color zero for copper and then of
course with the NYX glitter primer
alongside as well the color of this
glitter is just so oh my god it's so
pretty and it's just so easy to wear
this glitter I've won loads of glitters
on my eyes and this glitter has even the
only girl that people have gone what's
on your eyes and that's when you know
NYX as well it's affordable as you know
it's one of my favorite drugstore brands
for sure it's affordable and look how
much glitter you get in here this is
literally gonna last me forever it's
gonna sound really weird but they go as
a really nice size and it doesn't like
irritate my eyes because you would think
like pinklet any eyes would be really
scratchy and uncomfortable like not this
one and then yeah like I said they mix
clear primer is the best thing to stick
any glitter down we've not just bit
being NYX it could be any glitter it
sticks the glitter down it's not gonna
go anywhere you're not gonna get any
fallout on your face for out the night
it also doesn't cause anything to crease
or crumble or flake off it just
it's the best like glitter glue primer
thing I've ever used
so yeah shout out to you NYX because if
I've ever won clit on my itis year it's
probably been this one another NYX
product here so as far as eyeliner goes
like wearing my wings I mean I've got
them on today I'm also towards the end
of this year I've been really feeling
the wings again I kind of like go on and
off Brangwyn die loner sometimes I love
it sometimes I'm like me but as of
recently I've been like kind of loving
it again and this eyeliner here is
always the eyeliner that I end up going
back to I mean I've tried loads of good
eyeliners like the Primark one-pound
eyeliner is amazing the NYX like ink pen
liner again is another really good one
if I want an eyeliner that I know for
sure is not gonna crumble off is not
gonna smudge basically it's just gonna
stay on my eyes the entire like day
night like you could sleep in this and
it wouldn't go anywhere it will be this
eyeliner it's the NYX matte liquid
eyeliner so first off it comes with a
little brush it's the perfect size so
it's super easy to you know create those
really precise wings as you can see look
at that it's so Diddy I'm so you know
you can get that like sharp AF wing also
while I love about it it's super super
like jet black so you know we're not
gonna have no faded like wing over here
now today and more importantly it says
matte i way prefer a matte liquid
eyeliner to like any other like finish
because matte ones look the most like
either i don't know if you guys have
ever had if if you have more of like a
shinier finish eyeliner it's sometimes
gonna look kind of patchy and the
formula is a little bit like more watery
i don't know it just doesn't come on as
smooth and as nice whereas this one just
a little gem basically everything you
would want from a liquid eyeliner this
has it's just a perfect formula it's not
matte where it's like really dry and
crumbly it's just it's just it's perfect
okay so for me this year I have
definitely been a lash like a false
eyelashes girl I just think they
complete like any look they're just so
easy for me I stick them on and it's
just done however if I like run out of
lash glue or I just have them days where
I'm just not like fillings sticking on
an eyelash
this mascara has my back you guys this
is hands down the best mascara the best
mascara probably ever I love my benefit
roller lash
but I just I think this one beats it I
think it beats it it is the Maybelline
lash sensational mascara I've been using
this for months and months now and it's
never ever let me down it lengthens my
lashes like so so long it's super super
blackout's the perfect amount of volume
you know it doesn't make your lashes
look really clumpy again this is another
product that when I wear it people like
what is on your eyes and it doesn't you
know some mascaras can leave like them
black smudges like underneath and kind
of up here after you've worn it for a
while yeah my way you like sweat and it
just like transfers and it's just some
annoying no matter how long I've had
this mascara on for it does not do that
it's just it's so good and that's why
even the waterproof version they do have
a waterproof version which I never wear
waterproof mascara because I hate taking
it off that's just a regular one so much
more than water before I must be like so
flippin good ahh loves it the last thing
I'm gonna talk about today is lipstick
so this is probably the one makeup
product that I have way too much of but
you can just never go wrong with a good
lipstick you know what I mean it was so
hard
it's like choose my favorites there are
so many lipsticks I still haven't even
tried I'm like I've picked up the
lipsticks that I've worn the most and
what my like favorite colors are you
know what because I've been obsessed
with lip glosses this year I'm gonna
start with them I used to love a good
matte lip you know like everyone went
through that liquid lipstick phase where
I had to be like the maddest of them map
but now it's all about the glosses guys
okay so if you're after a gloss that not
only has like high shine but it's also
like super boo pub pigmented the
maybelline vivid hot lacquers are the
best no not only do I love the formula
of these but the colors that they have
are so good and I like right on my
street they have the perfect like a
pinky nude one and the perfect brownie
nude one we have T's which is this one
here which is a really really nice like
milky baby pink and then we also have
unreal cuz is unreal no but this is like
the perfect Brown it's just like the
brown a version of T's these are more of
a thicker formula but they're not sticky
I hate the heat loss it might move my
like 14 year old self when used to get
them in magazines
no thank you where they're thicker they
last a really long time and to be honest
with you you don't even have to wear a
lipstick with these you could just throw
these on that
I'm actually wearing unreal today like
shine oh and then if you're looking for
something that doesn't really add too
much color but is like shiny you know
that gloss that has a really really fine
glitter in it so it looks like super
glossy and just super like this is what
you need in your life this is the jus a
skinny dip lip topper this is definitely
another product that everyone has been
talking about and for all the right
reasons it's that good it smells so good
it is literally what it says on the tin
it's a lip topper so any lip color you
put on underneath put this on top it's
gonna make it super glossy and just make
your lips look like and then favorite
lip colors my first one is Mac MIFF this
is such an oldie but a goodie
this year has been the year of me like
whipping this out I even bought a new
one this year
I loved it that much I love a good like
nude nude you know this is the perfect
nude nude the perfect like amount of
pink the perfect amount of Brown it's
just just so good the next two are of
course nudes because that's pretty much
what I live in they're both liquid
lipsticks as well the first one is the
ofra liquid lipstick in Sao Paulo I
believe you say that the reason why I
love this most of all is because of the
color is a nice formula it's more kind
of that moosie liquid lipstick the color
is that really really nice of baby pink
but isn't too baby pink you know doesn't
wash you out or anything like that it's
just the perfect nude pinky shade white
all liquid lipsticks the longer you wear
them like they will start to dry your
lips a little bit but this one doesn't
dry your lips too much because it is
more that like moosie light formula and
yeah really love this color and then the
other one I've been obsessed with is by
a beauty bakery I mentioned this earlier
this is in I like to ChaCha
it's a giant ahi why have I never read
that lipstick color before the color is
a little bit darker than what I would
normally go for however the reason why
I'm putting this in there is because
these it could tip sticks do not budge I
have never known a liquid lipstick to
last as long as these ones do they're
super super comfortable because they're
really really thin but they're a little
bitch to girls because they just don't
roof the packaging as well it's super
super cute it's really well made
just have to include this in here I
don't hear enough people talking about
these and I feel like they should
because they're really long lasting and
then pretty much the only other lipstick
color I've been wearing it this year has
been red the first red eye side Rome was
the Maybelline liquid matte one that's
amazing but it just doesn't dry down
enough for me so it will transfer and
then I found this one which is the
makeup forever liquid lipstick in 4:01
now when I wear red I do want it to be
more of a liquid lipstick because I hate
worrying about it like being on my face
we've all had their moments where we
like eat or drink something and then
we're like crap it's on my face the
reason why I love this one so much again
the formula it's nice it's not super
super drying or anything like that but
the main reason is because this is the
perfect shade of red I find it's so hard
to find a red sometimes they edge to
purple or the edge to pink and it's just
so annoying I might just give me a wet
you just want a red this liquid lipstick
is literally the perfect red take a look
at that look at you look at you it's
just red it's exactly a lot of them okay
so I think I have shown you the main
products of 2017 for me to be honest
with you I feel like I could add in way
more about this video is already gonna
be like 10 hours long so I feel like
