with another video on my channel from
today like from this video I'm gonna be
starting a brand new series which I'm so
buzzed for because like anything to do
have clothing I'm like hell yeah
basically the whole idea of one of these
videos we're gonna be trying out a
clothing brand and basically finding out
whether it's worth you guys spending
your money on whether just keep it keep
your hard-earned going it's gonna be
like my kind of normal try on hauls kind
of I guess but it's gonna be on one
brand instead of you know like a bunch
of brands in one that way we can really
test it out test orders you guys know
we're kicking off this little series
with the one and only does anyone else
want to do that just me keeping it real
with you guys
I have bought off boohoo many a time
before I do like that's the helpful I've
nicely had any of their stuff for a hot
minute so to be honest with you they
could totally like change you know we're
gonna see whether they've upped their
game or their it's like going down here
like we can find out together
also because honesty is of course the
best policy I did just want to let you
know that boohoo really really kind me
sent me across a few bits for this haul
and but that is not going to affect my
opinion in any way because like there's
just not worry about on this channel I'm
gonna give you the truth as always
because that is what we do here also
really really quickly this is so cool
okay like I am so so grateful for booboo
for doing this actually before I say
this I just won't say I'm not sponsored
in any way shape or form I feel like
some people out there will probably
think I'm gay and paid to say this
I wish honey I wish I did just want to
clear that up because boo who gave me a
code yes
they didn't say that how to use or
anything but if there is an opportunity
where I can get something for you guys
you know I'm gonna do it right here on
the screen this is a code that you guys
can use to get free next day delivery
yes please I don't know about you guys
but next day delivery is my shit like I
love that it's so helpful
it's so perfect for the moments where
your friends like let's go out let's go
out let's do it and you're like oh I've
got I think the next day's live without
ish the code will work from today so
Saturday the 27th for one week so it
will finish on the 3rd of February wow I
don't even know what year week day month
week I already said that is alright that
was literally the longest intro ever I'm
really sorry
we're gonna jump straight into the video
we're going to find out whether boo hoo
is worth you guys you know
I'm taking your money okay right so I'm
gonna kind of just like pull things out
around and we've got a bunch of stuff
here we've got coats we've got jumpers
we've got like a little bit of
everything basically I'm going to try
and make this video as helpful as
possible so when I do the client client
trip oh my brain actually didn't work
Osment say try on clips I don't even
know what come on laughs when I do the
trying Clips I'm going to kind of try it
on with a full outfit and tell you
everything's from and stuff so you can
kind of like vibe off me I guess because
I know when it comes to outfits knowing
what to pair with what is one of the
hardest things so hopefully this will
help you out a little bit fingers
crossed we're gonna start this video
with a little bit of fur a little bit of
pink I'm feeling it oh my god it
literally looks like a ball of fluff on
camera so this is a jacket it's kind of
like a long crop style long-sleeved pink
fur this is hella cute and low-key I'm
obsessed with this when I first got this
out the package the first thing I
noticed was how good a quality this is I
know this is gonna sound really silly
but it's a really nice weight it feels
really really like a good quality it's
just gonna add a little bit of color to
your outfit also I've worn this once and
oh my god does this keep you warm in
England at the moment oh my god it's
freezing you need a coat you know what I
mean and this is really like stylish you
know it adds something to your outfit
because sometimes coats I feel like
you're put on you're like oh it's my
outfit but when you find a cute one like
this don't worry I got mine in a size 8
but again with this jacket it's easy to
size up size down it is 60 pounds and
some of you might think that is pretty
pricey but it's a staple coat it will go
with a line also boohoo have discounts
all the freaking time so you know you
can easily wait for sales but to be
completely real with you guys like it is
a good quality coat in 60 pounds in like
the grand scheme of things really is not
bad at all when I wear it I'm like a
little fireball I love it I will show
you guys right now how I stole it so
here is the pink oh I literally love it
I feel like this jacket you put on and
it will literally make any outfit like I
pretty much just have on a plain black
outfit like this
black right top from misguided I think
miss Cartier it's misguided black jeans
from Primark my little I'm a shiny boots
from Primark as well this bag is from
H&amp;amp;M I'm actually obsessed as well pink
pink you guys know and then I also have
these little glasses here these are
actually from ebay but I feel like they
kind of
I don't know I don't know they kind of
just add a little something to the look
I guess I mean what do you guys think I
actually love it I feel like it is
totally worth 60 pounds like any day
it's all fluffy oh my god the little
girl that says that in that film oh my
god check this out I was literally her
when I was younger tell me why oh my god
okay this jumper is like weig see you
know when a jumpers got a good way and
you're like I've not worn this yet but
holy crap okay so this is basically this
really big oversized gray jumper they
had in this amazing cream ivory color as
well which I may have to indulge in so
it's got this like lace up detail in the
middle here it kind of has all these
little like what would you call this I
don't know it looks like it's kind of
just got like shredded bits of material
over it it's got these really nice
tassels hanging from it as well it's
also really heavy in my arms about to
like fall off its kind of got lower arm
holes as well I feel like this is gonna
be one of those jumpers that just of
like flatteringly
it's our word flatteringly it just like
will hang off you but in like a
flattering way you're not going to look
like just like a walking bit of material
basically this looked hella fine on the
model when I was like I need that in my
life this is in a small / medium annie
is 35 pounds which honestly if we could
call it over I would have been like so
shocked if it was any cheaper to be
honest oh my god I'm nobody
this is literally the coziest thing ever
like I'm gonna take this off this is
just so fab like honestly I want this in
all the other colors as well the way
that I have chosen is kind of where I've
just tucked in the front a little bit
like that I mean you can totally just
wear it out as well it still looks nice
but it's just kind of tucked a little
pin I've tucked them into these wet look
pants I'm pretty sure these are from
Miss pop I think but these just kind of
I thought these look kind of cool as
cool as I can look but I've just bought
these like platform chunky boots from I
think they're actually from big yeah
they are just to kind of keep everything
black so the jumper is more of like a
statement you know like the focus is
more on the jumper than anything else I
just love how much detail there is like
all over it oh my god the strings that
like going everywhere 100% would
recommend this I love it actually have
four kind of like coats
show you I think I'm in a little coke
crazy now this coat okay
I've seen this one other people and it's
looked so cool but I feel like it can go
two ways I feel like you can wear it and
you'll look really cool and edgy or you
can wear it and look like you've gone
like a bin bag I thought you know what
I'm gonna show you I'm gonna make it
work I mean holding up really isn't
helping the situation
this is basically a black vinyl puffer
jacket I think well I really like it is
it's got a collar to it so I think it
makes it look really kind of edgy I like
the way the sleeves as well are kind of
more tight yeah there's not much more
else to say about it it feels nice like
it's as you can see it's really kind of
puffy I've never really tried this kind
of thing before but I'm always down to
try new styles and new things it's kind
of nice add things to your wardrobe
these kind of don't necessarily own I
love the fact it's vinyl it's gonna add
like a different texture to your Errol
for a different kind of vibe all
together they get an all-black outfit
you know this coat on top to add texture
yeah yeah as far as this off material
and the style of coat goes I'm really
impressed by it you guys can see on
camera it's more puffy it's not that
really thin material you know you get
some powerful jackets which are like
really thin in like flat this has like
bounce to it can you see I'm like
pressing on it it's like bouncing back
mine is in small I believe you and small
yeah and it's just soft average jacket
price it is sixty pounds here is the
black Jean Eco in action what do we
think
do you know what surprisingly I'm kind
of digging it I think what kind of makes
it for me is the color where I saw
sticks up it kind of has that like edgy
feel anyway so you can kind of pon any
outfit with it and make it look cool if
you want it's I genuinely don't feel
like it looks like I grabbed that bin
liner on just I'm actually feeling it so
I have on this original this is I could
just did meet the staff merch tour
thingy this is from the men's section in
Primark I just like tied it in a knot at
the front and these amazing boots from
boohoo I do show you these at the end of
the hall but they're just like shiny
black so kind of like you know matches
the coat and then they have like a mesh
inside they're just they're really
different I'm not gonna lie though it
definitely is like an acquired taste I
feel like you either love it or you
won't
you'll even look and be like or you're
looking either way that I look it
anything okay I can f with that I can
this with this yes say yes for me and
now for something a little more dressy I
you know going out with the girls
they're definitely a got yeah
I knew that was a hair swing was
tickling my nose this dress so I have
already tried on this dress because
honestly when it came I was so excited
he is this black satin kind of I guess
you could say kind of wrap dress the top
of is kind of that shirt vibe your nose
has a collar and stuff and then it has a
tie bit round the middle so you can oh
you can really bring everything in bring
that waist in snaps up ways and it's a
little mini dress and the bottom is kind
of asymmetric so one side is higher than
the other you know you're showing a
little bit of Phi they had it in red - I
went for the black you know black is
just it goes with everything it's just a
safer option bricen sizing so I stuck to
my size a size 8 and is only at 25
pounds when I tried this on and stuff
you'll know what I mean but honestly
this fits that's all I'm saying this is
all I'm saying
okay so here is the dress on I
absolutely love it like even more than I
do like off I don't know I feel like it
looks really classy but it's still kind
of sexy because you know it is pretty
low-cut I love the asymmetric vibe just
so you guys know I'm not wearing a bra
because it is so low-cut but you could
easily like tape it here and wear a bra
you know you weren't too like fussed
about this I love this but in the middle
here you can really like bring
everything together it's a really nice
length as well it isn't too sure
anything like that I love it I actually
love it I just went ahead and pet it
with these black fluffy heels that kind
of tie around your leg as well for my
sort flowers but obviously because it's
black it will literally go with like
anything but yeah this is exactly how I
would wear it let's you just throw on
some black heels and you're good to go
these next two things I'm actually gonna
show you them together because I'm gonna
try them on in the try and clip together
cuz I actually bought them in my head to
pair together if that makes sense just
you guys know what I've been loving
doing at the moment is pairing colors
together so if I have a pink coat I love
wearing like a pink skirt with it or if
I've got a jacket with a hint of like
green in it like this one I love to wear
like a green jumper or something where
they're kind of like colds I don't know
what it is about record it looks like
you've put way more effort in than what
you have it's like you thought about
matching it do you know what I mean when
really you've just put two of the same
color together see I have one this cut
out once and it is probably in my top
like three coats easily first of all
even just me holding it up can we talk
about how expensive this coat looks
emerald green fur here it just makes the
coat look
so expensive it's basically this black
aviator coat I don't know what material
this is it's so soft it kind of looks
like it's lever on camera it's not
always a really really soft material I
have absolutely no idea what they've
done with that but I like it it's got a
buckle around the farm pockets and
everything and do you know the best
freaking part about this coat look at
the middle guys the whole thing like
sleeves and everything is lined with
that green fur I just can't live in this
plane the softest thing ever it keeps
you so warm it's just really really
well-made I am honestly super impressed
with this jack is probably one of the
things in the hole that I'm like really
impressed with this cow is 45 pounds 45
pounds is so good mine's in a size 8 as
well by the way and it fits really
really nicely and then the jumper die
got to pair with it so here is the jump
I mean as you guys can probably tell
it's got a similar sort of texture to
the coat which is why it kind of matches
you kind of get like the feel I actually
wore this jumper in my no my last video
the one before that of my mum and so
many of you are asking where it's from
so yeah it's that really soft sort of
stretchy fabric it's got long sleeved
it's kind of cropped as you can see it's
more like a long crop though it's not
you know you're not gonna show any of
these why is everything so soft the
neckline if you guys can see that as
well as kind of white so you can wear it
you know a bit off the shoulder you can
wear it kind of more normal it's totally
up to you my one isn't a small / medium
but if you really like your jumpers to
be you know oversized really loose
really comfy really baggy then I would
definitely size up it's only 20 pounds
as well now I'm excited to style this
okay so here is the jacket and jumper on
it together I'm obsessed I love it I
feel like it genuinely looks like it's
meant to be together like the colour of
the jumper and the color of the fur on
the coat it actually like it matches
yeah this is pretty much how I would
style it as well at the things I would
pair it with I've gotten the shiny miss
PAP pants again I've just put it with my
white Air Force Ones which I literally
pair with everything I wear them pretty
much every single day of my life a Baker
boy hat which I don't actually know if
it really suits me but I feel like it
kind of like is what I've been with the
outfit or just like throw on this is
from Nasty go and then this bag again I
literally wear with everything is from I
saw it first here's the jumper as well
by itself in case you wanted to see what
it looked like
I kind of wear my nail up off the
shoulder but like I said you can kind of
wear it like normal if you want it
you're so cozy I don't think I know this
is the kind of length of it and
everything absolutely obsessed with the
coat and the jumper I would a hundred
percent say you need in your life if
you're like me and you just literally
live in the most like comfy as clothes
ever I know right now are you thinking
are you Jordan I have on this top but
I'm wearing like comfiest little camera
shorts ever this every youtuber Belle
yeah if you like me and you live in that
kind of clothes you're really going to
appreciate this next I am a pair of
black skinny joggers the bottoms are
cuffed which I really really like and
the top is your screen so you know again
we can pull it in give us some shape and
a thing I really really appreciate about
these chokers is they are super super
high waisted so you know if you've got
like a food baby or you know anything
you want to cover then you can I love
how I say food baby cuz honestly like
most relatable to me food baby and then
also as but see boys and girls but boys
you're really lucky you don't go free
there's bar girls periods we will get
that bloatedness right and I'm just I'm
not about that huh so these comfy but
you're gonna like cover it up the reason
why I got these is because I feel like
you can dress these up as well as just
wear them like chilly also just to
mention the quality of them they are a
nice thick jogger and then I don't know
if you guys can see in the inside but it
is really really soft it's kind of it's
not fur but it kinda is like cotton wool
kind of for like softer do you know what
I mean mine are size 8 and they are only
12 pounds 12 freaking pounds that is so
good and I feel like these can just look
so cool like a couch kind of cool yeah I
have no words
these are the comfiest snug and like
nicest joggers I own like what these are
any 12 pounds as well I think I need
them in like every single color they're
not only so comfortable they are super
flattering as well and joggers like this
you can totally wear out I just paired
it with this cropped honey jumper from
shy-shy wardrobe on Instagram and then
actually a pair of heels to like dress
it up even more it's the most simple
item but is actually one my favorites
it's probably one of my favorites
because like I live in these and they're
really flowery and basically 10 out of
10
we're on to the last jacket now but this
is more kind of like the cardigan so I
feel like it is different to the others
it does smell it I'm like oh those looks
you like fluff everywhere it does have a
little bit of a funky smell for some
reason maybe it's just where it's like
brand-new but this is another jacket
which is gonna add that texture to your
outfit not gonna lie you put this on
your like you just do this so they call
this a cropped shaggy cardigan oh my god
that was so much Chucky also the color I
feel like it looks kind of white on
camera is more of ivory so it is a bit
more like off-white this is in ASA why
am I doing this my one is in a small an
ears of 45 pounds there is now a little
bit of fluff flying all around my room
this jacket is honestly kind of amazing
it's literally like the perfect crop I
just went ahead and pet it with I'm
pretty sure this is a body suit from
boohoo it just is like a little frilly
high neck bodysuit black jeans and the
belt is also from Primark and then my
white Air Force Ones as well this bag
again as well I just I know I feel like
it is super super easy to star though
because it is what you can pretty much
wear it with anything to be honest but
again because I feel like it is such a
different coat I want it to be the stand
on the outfit so I just went all black
again you can't go wrong with all black
though they actually feel like a giant
Cornwall ball and I'm not even mad about
it huge thumbs up from me so just which
I'm gonna go back to the more you know
dressier outfit this dress is the most
like glitzy thing I've ever seen do you
not just like look at this dress and
kind of fall in love sorry Elliot I'm in
love with a dress now I'm obsessed with
the color you know that dusky kind of
pink and of course it's covered in
sequins so you know shiny I yeah I'm not
sure why but to me the straps are really
interesting they're like stretchy like
elastic but then they also have
adjustable thingies and then the
neckline as you can see it's kind of
more that square neckline so me this
looks like something you'd find on a
poly if you guys have ever been on Oh
Polly you know their vibe is kind of
like this which I really like and then
the dress is a mini mini no it's a mini
dress so it comes like mid-fight now of
course because this has so much detail
to it and you know it's covered in all
these sequins it is a little bit more
pricey it's 35 pounds I mean don't get
me wrong I've seen dresses that are
like this and a lot more expensive but
it definitely isn't the cheapest like it
is just kind of standard kind of but I'm
pretty sure it's a size eight
it's a size eight and so yeah that is
that I feel like I have to style it and
try it on to really see wherever I think
it is worth thirty five pounds or not I
mean it looks like it is don't get me
wrong but hopefully the thing and
everything is good too
okay right I do love this dress I love
how like Clarion sparkly is one thing I
would say though I wish it was tighter
I'm kind of just like a pinch the dress
you know what he means so I would
definitely like size down for sure it is
of course meant to be a body con by
Tiffany's like it could be tighter if
the dress was more like this kind of
more hug to my shape I think it would be
a lot nicer but puffs from that I really
like everything else I love that you can
adjust these straps so you can wear this
but as high or like as low as you want
it's really really cute like I love all
the like sparkles I pet it with these
simple rose gold heels from I saw it
first and if you did want to take a
jacket
I feel like this pink fairy jacket would
look really cute from be here with that
just like be even more extra yeah that
is how I would wear anyway like if you
did want a jacket I know it is freezing
in England so is nice to like layer up
yeah I think it's really cute really big
um I think it's super girly as well
keeping with the whole kind of dress of
theme but we're gonna go way more casual
we're gonna go to a jumper dress oh my
god look at the neck could you imagine
that it is a row neck don't worry again
this is another I am boohoo like you've
made this so well it is super super
thick you know it's gonna keep you warm
honest I've been super impressed with
everything that's been aired in this
video it just feels such good quality
this is nothing like revolutionary I've
seen these dresses everywhere it's just
got a huge sort of row neck at the top
long sleeved and then it is just a jump
up dress it comes to what is this look
like one of them boyfriend pillows
you'll see the way it fits and
everything in the Tryon so I won't talk
about it too much now but for all my
girls and boys out there who loves
wearing this kind of thing in the winter
but still want to keep warm you know
that kind of weather appropriate this is
perfect for that because it is literally
a jumper dress it's great as well so
really really easy to wear they also
have it in a bunch of other colors which
is really cool like pink mustard black
Burgundy I think that's
couple of us as well mine is Ian a small
and it is 20 pounds but then even though
those 20 pounds jumper dress is on do
you know what the first thing I actually
noticed about this dress is it is still
quite flowering it's gonna sound really
silly but I have tried on jump dresses
before I mean literally just have no
shape and make you look like a box and
there's like a pencil
but this one actually doesn't do that I
don't have to put anything around the
waist and maybe bring you in or anything
it still looks kind of nice like this
I've gone for a pretty like classic
jumper dress look I feel like personally
high boots with a jumper dress honestly
you can't be wrong is it just me or do
knee-high boots I guess and you dress up
an outfit like these ones here actually
from boohoo they have like a peep toe
these are actually my favorite honestly
boohoo knee-high boots on my absolute
favorite I have two pairs from now and I
love them both and then of course just
got this bag with it as well to be fair
I mean if you wanted to add a belt I
feel like you totally like a Kurt this
is kind of go yeah see this is a thing
without fish you can literally play
around with any accessories that you
want also I do just want to point out
that jumper dress is not too short at
the end of my bum is here so there's
like plenty of material to cover
everything like I'm not gonna bend it
over and my toe she's gonna be hanging
out I'm so cozy why is he yes yeah
overall love this thumbs up for me this
skirt here like I already just love this
I have nothing like this in my wardrobe
and it's one of those things which I has
a little added something to it like the
stripes but it's so easy to wear it is a
black denim skirt and as you can see it
has white lines down it kind of gives me
more like a sporty vibe it's got pockets
in the front pockets in the back it also
has this really nice like Freight edging
down here kind of it's kind of cool
feels like a normal denim skirt as well
you know nothing like different about it
whereas black as well you know it's
gonna go with a bunch of different
outfits so the wearability out of this
is gonna be like top-notch you know you
can about to wear it a lot did I just
say top notch just checking for pricing
real quick they've got in a size 8 by
the way Andy he is 18 pow not gonna lie
that looks like something else Urban
Outfitters and you would easily pay
double for that in there so good job
baby here is the skirt on I really by
the way I'm holding their jacket because
honestly I swear it's like 100 degrees
in my room right now I'm like melting is
honestly these like
it's like girl I mean here is the jacket
on in case you did want to say it is
from pretty old thing it's just like a
cropped fur one the little top is from
boohoo and the Bellas part let's take
that off because I am melting and then
my shoes are my classic black and white
bands you honestly can't go wrong
they're like the copy issues ever also
just to say before people are like oh my
god are you gonna be freezing in that
don't be afraid to layer up like I would
honestly go out with tights on and a
jacket and I'll be good to go I just
haven't put the monks I can't find it
for the life of me but just to give you
an idea of how it would kind of look
sort of thing I was a little worried
that the skirt might be a bit too short
I think it's fine like nothing's gonna
show this is it and would I recommend it
definitely its next piece to a lot of
you you might see it as a little bit
daring a little bit risky and I can
totally see why but I feel like star
right it's gonna look so good not me
look good in it but just like the actual
like anyway this is so cute oh my god I
mean so summery this might look like a
lingerie kind of piece that you'd wear
in the bedroom if you feel me but I
think this will look so nice with a pair
of jeans or something on a night out or
like a date night or something so this
is like a white lace kind of bodysuit as
you can see it is completely mesh here
but if you stick some nipple covers on
it's all good it's all good sheet and it
goes all the way down to a bodysuit the
only bad thing about this is there's no
buttons here so you know when you wear
it you can have to do the the pull to
the side kind of thing and then the back
is just plain like this and it has sort
of a strap going across as well the
reason why I love this as well is
because the lace pan goes all the way
like down pretty much I don't know if
you guys have ever had it but some body
suits they're like cut off and then
they'll go to plain material and then
when I wear like high-waisted jeans and
stuff sometimes they're not high-waisted
enough and you see like whether material
changes on the body so it's really
strange and I'm like whereas with this
you don't have that problem at all it
doesn't matter if you know your things
aren't super super high waisted like
it's chill I stuck to my size by the way
I got a size a I always do in body suits
and this was only 14 pounds which the
last such a good price just going off of
the way it feels and the way it looks
and everything I'm actually really
really impressed and for the price I'm
feeling this is such a versatile
bodysuit like I've had it with these
camo pants from burst together actually
from the men's section and then my sock
boots from I saw it first and it's given
it like it really like casual look but
if you want a head
like a wet look skirt or something in a
leather jacket it would instantly tell
it's more of a night outfit I love
pieces like that because you literally
get so much wear out of them with their
supple repair that maybe like a black
denim jacket or something I haven't put
it on there just so you could see the
body sue this is what it's like at the
back by the way
it's got like a bar across the middle by
the way if you're wondering why you
can't see my nipples it's because I've
got a nipple covers on otherwise they'd
be like hi I just think it's really cute
by the way you can actually tighten the
straps as well so don't worry about the
babies what this mean you go as well
it's like a camo beanie
do you know what I feel like that
actually does I think it makes it even
more cash overall why can I hear
seagulls I'm like nowhere near a beach
are they lost are they confused like the
last clothing item now so it is another
jumper apparently I went and knitwear
Cree the reason why I love this I don't
know why I've just been obsessed with
this creamy stone color at the moment
and I love the style the fit in
everything about this I have nothing
like this in my wardrobe so it's a
Roenick jumper but if you guys can see
it's super distressed and then at the
bottom of the jumper it's really
distressed as well and then it's
distressed on the sleeves of the whole
thing assault like distress again it's
kind of a long crop as well really
really oversized which is like super
slouchy really effortless super comfy
but you still look like you made an
effort I feel like it will look really
cool some you know black ripped jeans
stick into that Moss off edgier vibe
mine is in a small size medium it was 25
my phone is going crazy
this to me is kind of that like basic
staple winter item I am not mad at this
at all like I said boohoo do knitwear
really really good right okay so I feel
like this jumper would look better
actually with black ripped jeans but I
had a look and I don't actually own any
black rip jeans
my DS button so I paired it with these
blue ones instead because obviously they
are really ripped as well I tried the
blue guys for sure but I just think
maybe black I don't know these jeans by
the way are from a fashion neighbor and
then I just spent with these black stock
boots from my store at first she said
like dress up a little bit I do really
really like this jumper I love the neck
I love the feel of it it's super super
nice and warm I love how like distressed
it is too but if there was one thing I
could change it would be the leg
I don't know what it is I just like it's
a little bit awkward it's not long it's
not sure it's just kind of there I feel
like if it was more like here maybe I
prefer it I don't know tie it to be fair
that's an idea but no apart from that
the actual drum pie itself is pretty
nice but if you are kind of fussy like
me and are fussy about like the crop
then yeah just bear that in mind but the
jumper itself is fab on to the last
thing now I say this to last because it
is a pair of shoes I really wish I could
have got more shoes and accessories from
boohoo but the things I saw that I
really liked didn't have my size or were
just sold out so I only picked up once
of extra item really really sorry about
that fat these are cute I haven't seen
any other website have anything like
this and I also don't own anything like
this Eva how flippin cool are these so
they are black like shiny paintin is
that we call it technical the pointed
toe boots not gonna be real with you
guys I don't normally like pointed toe
on me I feel like it makes my feet look
really long and I'm only a size 5
however where these are more kind of
healed they don't look long at all they
look just kind of normal I love to study
tail along the toe as well and I also
love the detail on the hill can you guys
see that
it's like a chunk has been Kyle and then
the part about this shoe which I was
like the mesh here you guys can see if
that imagine that was my foot I don't
know what it is these are just cool do
you know I mean like these are just cool
that's the only way I can really
describe them you can literally star
these with everything jeans skirts then
black joggers would look really cool
literally anything they will go with so
so much I like them I really really like
them how much were they fake pounds yeah
a pretty standard price for a pair of
shoes like you kind of pay that price
some places like public desire and
things like that so yeah happy about it
ok so I've tried everything on obviously
at the end of each Tron clip I told you
whether I think each individual item is
worth getting or not by thought I would
sit down and just give you like my final
overall thoughts on boohoo
so what do I think would I purchase from
boohoo again hands down like 100% I was
so impressed with the quality of the
items with the price through who in my
opinion like to me
it is one of the more affordable places
like if I compare it to misguided for
example it is way cheaper obviously
there are some items which you know I'm
a little bit more expensive but the
majority of their stuff is super well
priced and the quality of some of these
bits
holy moly I'm so impressed like who but
no overall I loved everything there's
obviously only a couple of things which
I would of just slightly tweaked or
change but like that's kind of normal I
I loved everything and I feel like that
is very rare a lot of the time when you
do online shopping you just don't know
how things are gonna fit how they're
gonna look if they're gonna look like
they do on the website or if they're
gonna look you know like the model one
you if that makes sense let's just say I
was not disappointed at all and I would
definitely be repurchasing from boohoo
FOMO
