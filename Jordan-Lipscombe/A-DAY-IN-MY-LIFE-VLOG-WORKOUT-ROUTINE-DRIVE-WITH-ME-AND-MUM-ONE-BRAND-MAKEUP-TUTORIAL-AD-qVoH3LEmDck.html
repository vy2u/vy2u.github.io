again with another YouTube video
first of all ignore this hot mess I'm
literally about to do my hair get
changed get ready to finish off going
out but you'll see that later on in the
video it will make sense then but as for
right now today's video is something a
little bit different this is gonna be a
kind of day in my life style video
basically it's been more like a vlog II
fail
what's okay I honestly love being able
to different types of videos for my
channel so super hard for this questions
or comments that I get on a regular
basis would be like what's your workout
routine do more makeup videos like that
kind of vibe so this video allows me to
show you all of that kind of so you're
gonna see a little like sneak peek of me
at the gym what I do you're also gonna
see a one brand makeup look might be on
my face right now
who knows and just a couple of extra
things thrown in there of my everyday
everyday kind of life so without further
ado let's get into this a video I hope
you guys enjoy it right as you guys saw
in the intro I'm gonna be doing like a
day in my life style video and we are
starting the day off I went to the gym
hence this this this I've been trying to
go to the gym a few times a week you
know to bring work and then month I
think they're splitting us up can I just
say it's 13 being in the red hair
because though she's harder basically
gonna bring the camera along and just
show you guys a few bits I'm gonna wake
my sister as well that's technically why
do I always have to go to the gym where
somebody isn't that motivation to
actually like do something oh I thought
this would be good to sit on somebody by
any wise okay I'm actually creating
right now so let's you know right anyway
that's good
okay so we're going to do 15 bridges yep
15 degree pounds like what each side
fifteen again these folks are heating up
again
you couldn't sleep in like a mini squat
position
so one to touch
I've got one more set
the work is done
oh that was literally the best show ever
I want to see showers after the GEMA
like the best also does anybody else get
these lines here I don't know what it is
I always get them also don't want my
nails are gonna be putting a new sell
them on a bit anyway so I start getting
ready and then I realized Jordan you
need to do like your actual skin care
stuff and I realized I should have a
little story to share with you guys a
little story time with Jules so as you
guys know I am like a vivid fake tan oh
I freaking love fake tan and wear all
the time but time can actually drive me
heck out of your skin like it dry out a
little bitch and then what happens to me
was now a normally moisturize before
town so that doesn't happen but I kind
of got sick of moisturizing logic I
basically done this to myself well I got
kind of sick of doing it because
moisturizers for me it takes so long to
dry and I just want to whack the tan on
sleep in it wash off and go like I have
a really quick pace busy lifestyle so I
don't have time to sit there and wait
for it to dry and also some moisturizers
can make you feel so sticky and kind of
greasy and really uncomfortable so
basically what happened was I ended up
with all these dry skin patches all over
my skin I had one like here and another
one here I had them on my shoulders on
my back like my skin was freaking out
and all these dry skin patches instead
picture here and no this is definitely
not loved by I really want to share
these with you because they are now part
of my everyday routine not just to
moisturize my skin but before I tan as
well this is on the floor so these are
the body shop body yogurts they come in
a bunch of flavors but these two are my
favorite this is the strawberry body
odor and this one is the almond milk
body yoga and this one is my always for
sensitive skin which is fab I actually
bought these with my own money as well
hope I mean the body shop are working
together for this part of the video as
well it's just so cool because we're
working together on a product I actually
believe them like I bought these I
believe in and they help my skin
honestly these smell they smell so good
and look how much of use of this like
this is like half empty the body shop
super super kindly gave me a discount
code which is cool because guys if I can
save you some coins you know I will I
will you on screen now and I get she 50%
off in-store and online so oh that's so
cool but yeah the reason why I love
these is because these are super super
fast absorbing like they absorb into the
skin within a 15 seconds yeah I mean I
like drown myself in there so it takes
like 15 to 30
seconds but that is still pretty quick
they're like nonstick as well they're
like a gel cream so when you put it on
like you don't feel that horrible like
greasy feeling which I said earlier but
these on damp skin as well so girl if
you're in a rush they got you I'm
actually just gonna go ahead and put
some on now and I'm gonna show you guys
in real time how quick this actually
dries so you can see that it's all like
shiny where it's still wet I'm gonna put
15 seconds on the clock I'm actually
gonna time it and we're gonna see how
quick they dry okay so that was 15 that
seconds just about so I don't know if
you can tell but it's basically all
absorbed into my skin like I said if
it's so much longer I love it but I
could let it get changed put my tan on
whatever I need to do basically I am
obsessed and I really wanted to well I
really just went to share these with you
because body care like 40 skin care is
just as important as your face as well
so yeah what is your body Oh gets a
winner for me also it's not just the
product I love I actually love the body
shop you like you guys know how much
I've worked with the body shop or raved
about them
I just loved their brand I love what
they stand I love how they like cruelty
free and just everything about them is
just so fab so right anywho um so I'm
gonna go get ready to sort myself out
put my face on I'm gonna show up with my
mom for a little bit and then later on
I'm going out for some drinks gonna get
crunk see you guys in a second when I'm
looking a little bit more presentable hi
welcome to my mum's carpool karaoke
right so we are basically about to go
shop in because that's what we do we do
my camera is the JIT tape to the car
right now
it's worse than hate
I've only got a few bits so far she's
over here we only got like a little bit
we've been in like on that five or six
shops today and we haven't actually
bought much we actually have her for us
this is quite mild we can really find
anything you know we have one of those
shopping trips I just can't find
anything in your villa you know what I
really fancy though a nice to count my
latte
I may have to indulge Oh stairs Hedgehog
market go friend
catwalk it yes yes oh yes I got my eyes
come on we're going home now though
we've all kind of shopped out for the
day got everything we need it so we're
gonna go hope we're gonna go back to the
la maison honestly mom I'm basically
French don't worry about it okay so
we're at more of a familiar setting
right now hole goes I am about to paint
this face
see ya just excuse whatever the heck
like what even is that can we I feel
like we all look like a hot mess when we
do our makeup okay because we just want
to like get it on and go it is the
evening right now and the reason why I'm
gonna put on some makeup is just because
I'm gonna go for a few drinks tonight
just to make cash so I feel like I'm
gonna do a classic Jordan makeup look
something simple something easy to do
and to kind of like switch things up a
bit instead of me using the same
products which I have used on my channel
a lot you know the stuff that I love I'm
actually gonna do a full face using body
shop makeup products because to be
honest I don't think the body shop
makeup has enough praise I actually want
to start doing more testing one brand
makeup looks on my channel I do test in
one run clothing videos but I feel like
makeup be quite cool to do as well right
so let's just kick this off with a blush
a makeup okay okay as you can tell my
brows are already on and I used one of
my favorite brow products from the body
shop this is their brow sculpt three and
one contouring at brow pen I have
mentioned this little guy before on my
channel but yeah on one end you have a
twistable twistable
why that didn't sound like a real words
me then I don't know little pencil which
I use to sort of shape my brows you know
go underneath go on top I enjoy the
formula of this pencil a lot it's not
too waxy and it's not too creamy it's
like that perfect in-between and then
there is a little powder puffy thing I
don't look at it and I use that to fill
in the front of my eyebrow because
powders are a lot softer meaning you'll
get that better
radiant easier to blend out and it just
looks you know a little bit more
flattering at the front of your brow and
then there is actually a brow gel on the
end as well
because you actually need but I don't
actually use that brow gel because it's
colored and I prefer more of a
translucent brow gel right let's carve
these little suckers out because they
have a Mac plate full coverage concealer
mine is in 0 to 6 these little pot
concealers are the best little things
ever for carving out your brows because
they have a really really good coverage
they're not messy or anything because
you know in just like this little brush
by the way as well this is their lips
lush concealer brush ok literally dead
silent when I'm doing this this is
Sarah's okay just be proud my browsing
to have a moment now I'm using their
brow and where you going brow and lush
gel to just you know set these in place
clear brow gels are the way to go
forward because I'm a hot mess and I can
just be so carefree whack it on my brows
not a problem
sweet forgot my primer you see that deep
don't really need a no be fine no should
probably use it right okay fine whatever
I said I like it like that all in one to
go date you - it's just my loved what
can I say we were gonna blow out these
claws claws
pause we're gonna blur out the pores
this foundation is definitely the best
one of the body shop do this is their
Mac clay at skin clarifying foundation
basically this is some full coverage ish
but it also has like tea tree in so like
skin clearing properties so if you
suffer with breakouts which you know
every boring gal does it's normal this
will help it along the way like the body
shop care for the skin at the same time
I see you I'm doing a little foundation
cocktail because I I mean I normally mix
this color but I have quite dark tan
today will you match maybe will mix will
mix I'm gonna mix Moroccan nutmeg Morken
with Thomas to me to Mirza Jun
basically zero five five and zero to six
so I'm gonna use their sponge as well
this is definitely not the softest
sponge ever I'm not gonna lie however I
like it because when you put it under
water it does expand meaning it doesn't
soak up a lot of product and it's quite
dense so I feel like you can really you
know get that coverage I just realized
I'm really going in right now I use a
calm down look at this coverage though
like this is what I'm talking about and
the finish as well is really really nice
it still has like a glowy chewiness to
it so it doesn't look you know read rye
and like crusty oh my god the only real
mission now is going around my brows I'm
just going in with my own concealer
purely because this logo here I don't
actually like concealers like this for
underneath my eye there too like much
for me but you do you boo if that's your
thing go for it and now I'm just gonna
go ahead and set this all in a place so
you know we don't melt off this is there
like all over face and body brush which
I'm gonna be using for my bronzer in a
sec as well I'm gonna use if my part of
to because it works this is the body
shop loose powder by the way said
underneath here oh look at that sponge
getting right in that corner I am
looking I'm looking all kind of shades
of pale so for bronzer oh yeah this is
so like a fro package right now I've
been using this bronzer ever since I
first started my channel which was two
years ago now and I still use this to
this day like this is an arrow it G
product this is their honey it bronzed
that in and zero free I just look so
soft I just love this bronzer it's so
much like the color is so nice for my
skin it's really really nice and warm so
I want to be looking bronzed and tanned
up in here I mean it has to be good if
I've been using it since day one
basically
let me do some cooling it up I mean this
is a look then it for blush I actually
rarely used to wear blush it was never
my thing as of recently I think blush
adds so much color back into your skin
into
so much more like mmm you know but now I
wear all the good sometime this is the
body shop no shit Sherlock
all in one cheek color in the shade
macaroon and look at this little guy on
their blush brush get that on there like
look how cute that color is I like a
blush shade that's kind of peachy kind
of natural more because listen I'm not a
hot pink kind of guy so this is just
that really nice like flush of color
look at how rosy let me dust this away
now I feel like I feel like it's ready
to come off it's time for highlights is
actually another og product this is
their highlight dome I've been using
this for a hot minute now and again it's
another favor it blends seamlessly into
the skin even when you've powdered and
it just gives me that like soft glow
from within glow look at me I swear I
can't walk out the house without
highlighter on like highlighters just
okay look at that like this is the body
shop like you can't be trippin for the
eyes like I said we're gonna hear pretty
simple when you keep it kind of drawn
style I'm gonna use one of their bilenda
ng brushes here which by the way this is
such a fab kind of like crease brush and
I'm gonna take the bronzer and just
whack this in the crease on the lid not
really caring too much just to add a
teeny bit of color it's actually one of
my favorite things to do like just put
bronzer on the eye and go and then I'm
gonna take a teeny bit underneath the
eye as well because I don't wear bottom
lash mascara so this kind of just like
ties the look together for me now we're
gonna go straight in with a wing
recently I've been loving me 1/2 wing
not forming waffling so to do that I'm
using their skinny thin fel eyeliner
this little guy look at did ears first
of all this is so good at getting that
like sharp cut a bitch wing you know but
first before we begin we have to say a
prayer for our wings and hope that they
don't door Saturday
Vaman
it'll color this in as you can see I've
stopped right here I'm not even going to
draw a line anywhere on this part of my
eye I want to keep that completely
eyeliner free and then I basically just
keep playing around with the liner to
get it how I want my shape by the way
how I like it is what I look down I like
this to be like a straight line on top
that helps
look how jet-black this eyeliner is as
well it's how we like oh okay
bloody roomy liner is anyone else's eyes
two completely different shapes are
trying to get your Island the same it's
actually a mission right Oh
time for some mascara this is the one
I'm gonna be using this is the lash hero
fiber extension mascara you had your
first agents fiber I'm pretty sure this
is anyone a few fiber lash mascara in
the drugstore which is fab so you get a
mascara wand on one end of course and
then you get all the little fibers on
the other I actually love the mascara in
this just by itself so I'm just gonna
use the mascara today because I am gonna
be applying forces as well but if you do
want to be even more extra and apply the
fibers then it's there for you oh I
actually love this mascara like the way
it makes my eyelashes look it's so good
one of the only mascara that I know of
that adds so much volume but still make
sure eyelashes look like you have a
loads of eyelashes if that makes sense
it doesn't clump your lashes together
basically is what I'm trying to say it's
just solid oh my god I just poked myself
in the eye mascara I'm actually crying
Wow
oh that's stun like a little bitch okay
don't get in your eyes guys it's
definitely not the aim at least my
lashes don't look good though am i right
ladies right now that I've actually been
traumatized I'm going to ahead of camera
apply some lashes and then I'll be back
okay I'm back
lashes I think is on the best will dry
but they're on very last thing to do is
lip so I'm gonna take the lip liner in
at the shade beech which is already nice
or like dark nude
Shh I don't know I'm talking while I'm
doing my lips these lip liners literally
collide onto my lips and then for the
actual lip color this is another product
that I spoke about so many times on my
channel this is a this is one of them
matte liquid lipsticks in the color
color color
Vienna julep which this is beautif is
color is so pretty the reason why I love
these liquid lipsticks so much is
because of the formula they will drive
our map but they do not like do not dry
out your lips I'm actually gonna take a
little bit of lisbonne freeze here it's
definitely just butchered that just in
the middle keeping it real guys this is
hands-down one of my favorite nude lip
combos ever like what the hell and this
is the body shop as well I don't feel
like people's first reactions would be
to go get a nude lip from the body shop
but this whole look for an actually wait
I've got to do sex spray let me just
like set this nice before we get deep to
finish this look off I'm actually gonna
use two different things berries they do
two different things okay so I just have
to use both this is their vitamin E
hydrating face mist this will kind of do
what like a fix plus would do it's the
same sort of concept so I'll spray this
and it will take away any like powder
eNOS powder eNOS oh I need like a James
Charles fan like and then this one is
their official makeup saying spray so
this is what's gonna lock all of our
makeup in stop it from smudging stop it
from melting stop it from doing all that
whoa I am sprayed and the look is done
can you actually believe that my entire
face right now is all body shop makeup
the body shop is not the first brand
that will come to mind when you think of
makeup but I'm hoping that maybe this
might change your mind a little bit this
is what I'm here to do this is my job
I'm here and my channels here to show
you products or brands or whatever that
aren't so hyped up all the time to
introduce new products to you I
literally could have sat here put on the
normal makeup products that I normally
use to go out but I don't want my
channels to be the same shit all the
time I want to do different things show
you all different things um it's my job
that's what I'm here for
that is it for this kind of
in my lifestyle a video I hope you
enjoyed it with something a little bit
different just took you along on my like
at home casual everyday life I guess so
