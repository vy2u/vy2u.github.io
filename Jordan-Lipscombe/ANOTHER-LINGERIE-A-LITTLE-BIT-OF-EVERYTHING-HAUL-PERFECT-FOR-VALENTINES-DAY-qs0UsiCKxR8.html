bucking it again with another YouTube
video and today I'm coming at you with
yet another launcher read Oh hope you
ready so a story would be a perfect time
in so maybe it's a lingerie hole because
you know the big v-day is coming out
Valentine's Day maybe galentine's day
for some here or maybe malla teens stay
hope for boys anyway it's just that time
it's that time where you know maybe we
want to pawn something a little bit
fantasy in a little bit like you know
but no I am really really excited
because last time I did this video it
was something brand-new for my channel
where I've never done it before so I was
like a little bit nervous to put it up
in case you know you guys weren't really
vibing with me but you guys are the best
you guys loved it just as much as I did
so you guys you guys always just killed
it with the support there is like a lot
of stuff here um I went a bit special my
bank account loves me and of course this
is another affordable haul that we've
got Primark boohoo I'm pretty little
thing if you're new to these kind of
videos I just want to let you know I
personally don't try this stuff on but
if there is a model I can show you or
just put the set together or picture
whatever I will show you in that way and
there is also a mixture of stuff we've
got lingerie bodies and I'm pretty sure
there's even like a suspender thing in
here really really quick I'm gonna make
this quick because I don't this intro to
be like 2 hours long on the screen here
I'm gonna put my sizing details so that
you can kind of maybe use mine as a
reference to know what size you would be
I know they're like brass sizing and
stuff can be so confusing because some
coming cup sizes and so I'm coming like
clothing sizes and you're just a bit
like what so hopefully this will help to
give you a better idea well it's tough
being ago DC
I don't even really like Diet Coke that
much but logic so I'm going to stop
boring you with the intro and let's get
into the juicy stuff the stuff you're
here for leggo yeah mmm who should we
start with do you know what let's start
with boo hoo because boo I'm so freakin
impressed
boo hoo calm okay also I have a pro tip
these things are already affordable but
just want to say really really really
little bit quickly boo hoo I don't have
pretty or thing does it buy no boo hoo
does if you put everything in your
basket kind of leave it there for a bit
boo he will email you and give you a
discount code so you can use it like
trying to like be like hey like you want
to get us in your basket here's a card
first I have to show you it comes as a
little parent so you get the bar on the
underwear together which we know isn't
the most like convenient thing ever
because some of us you know are
different sizes top compared to bottom
but it's cute so we have a burgundy
sudden little moment here and it's just
material there's no padding or anything
you can adjust these straps but the back
one like this but that goes around you
you can't actually you can't actually
adjust it it just is what it is what I
really like about this hopefully you'll
be able to see the like cups are further
away from each other than a normal bra
and I don't know what it is but it is so
flattering for your boobs especially if
you have my kind of like boobs I have a
lot of like side boobage but not a lot
of like middle boob inch so kind of like
pushes my boob just a little bit I don't
know I don't know I mean let's be real
here all Rascals up half the itty bitty
titty committee any help we can get
we'll take it and then the underwear
that it comes with I love the shape of
these it's more of that triangle shape
and let me show you this is so flowering
on you can write like this you can put
up over your hips and it is a thong
that's not which that's my thing
thongs Brazilian they're my style how
cute though I just love the fact it's
satin it looks expensive it fits like a
dream mines are so small by the way in
it fits snug snug as a bug in a rug it's
12 pounds as well which is crazy I got a
discount over my so I think I was like 9
pounds or something which bargain
boohoo coming for the route with the
goods
see you okay this next piece this is for
all of my people out there who love a
little bit of sexy who love a little bit
of you know if you know what I mean
this is gonna be so hard to show you
because look it literally is one long
bit of material it's not even in the
shape of a bodysuit look like it doesn't
even like curl background it's just is
long let me try and explain it a little
bit so you have these two bits which
cover your booze as you can see it is
mesh those so you see it all it's really
really low-cut like it comes all the way
down to below your belly button these
two ribbon bits tie up around your neck
and these two bits here they tie up
around your back like under your boobs
and then the bottom half okay so this
bit obviously goes like round under
Union and then you just hide these
ribbons together basically you just kind
of like tie it all around you and then
BAM
this is definitely something a little
bit cheeky er a little bit more kind of
like out there and definitely you know
for a certain someone I guess it's
really really pretty and as soon as I
saw it on boohoo I just like had to like
train in my basket mines in a size small
and it was twelve this one's really cool
dykes it's so different this is it here
so basically it has a bit up here that's
highs around your neck then it has like
a strap down the middle of your boobs
and then at two straps that kind of like
go around your boobs like this lace mesh
little bits few boobs and then this bit
that's just like chilling down here this
wraps around your body like underneath
so like it's another extra strap and
then the only bad thing about this one
is there's no like adjustable bits for
the straps and there's no adjustable
bits for your body so you kind of have
to be little bit more careful of sizing
but if it's really nicely so it's fine
and then the underwear has the exact
kind of same vibe kind of strappy and
Lacey as you can see there's like a
little Kyle bit on the back as well and
the style of the underwear is more kind
of Brazilian so it's kind of like half
on your cheek off not cool thing about
this one is they are sold separately so
you can get different sizes it comes in
the small/medium at larger I think it
comes a small medium large because it's
not she like a barrage and only mean
it's more like a brawler
mine are both in a small and the top was
ten and the bottoms were six so 16
pounds for this which is insane insane
in the membrane purely because there's
just so much going on with it and then
the very last thing I have from boohoo
here
is another body it's just a black mesh
body kind of simple right and then BAM
look there's no like X's on the boobs
it's really actually cool right I don't
know I just love how simple the cut is
on it it's just you know standard neck
it is a song back as well and then I
just love the little X's I think it just
like makes it I also love the fact it's
all that mesh as well and just like your
nips are covered I love it this is cool
I feel like that's all I can say it's
really edgy and just cool mine is in a
small and it fits really really well it
fits really snug and it kind of like
pushes on my boobs a little bit because
my like boobs a little bit off like a
like a boost and it's 12 pounds I was
going to do primary X we know I'm gonna
save them till last so I'm gonna do a
cradle thing now a pretty little thing
is the one all of them that is a teeny
bit more expensive it's not expensive at
all like it's definitely worth the price
it's just you know a few more pounds
this is so cute and I feel like you guys
are gonna love this as well we have a
pink satin little Sur pink so cute satin
I love this is just like a little dream
set just you know there is no padding or
anything in the cups is just your boob
anelia boob and then this was really
cool because you can actually adjust the
back you know you have them they all
like cookie things and you can also
adjust the straps as well which is
awesome I know
and then the bottoms are one of my
all-time favorite shapes for underwear
yay guessed it the triangle oh yeah why
is it saying like that it looks like
like it's for a man like a man join a
Keeney thing it is a triangle shape I
promise I don't know why it's doing that
it's a song as well and I really like
the waist it's a really elastic eight so
I really like fits on you I don't know
if you guys can tell on camera but this
is kind of long and it's because it's
it's a bit more kind of up like a bit
more high-waisted mine is in I'm pretty
sure it's all in a size small yes small
and are you small as well yes Melissa
the top is 12 pounds and the bottom is 8
pounds so that's 20 altogether which
isn't bad at all especially for you know
like satin if it's really really nicely
as well by the way that really
comfortably so yeah that is the first
piece I don't know what it is about this
next piece is - what you seem like
Instagram or something like Instagram
girls wearing it's this here so it's
this bodysuit I really like this because
not only will this be file for lingerie
can actually like you can wear this as a
bodysuit you guys know I love wearing
like lingerie kind of body suits as what
do you see it some nipple covers on
you're good to go
this one though I just love the whole
design of it I love the whole white lace
situation at the front it's got like the
line bits under the boobs they're not
wide or anything is just you know
material I love this design on the body
like the stripes and all this of lace
mesh at the back and then you have that
strap over here and then the adjustable
straps up here just so you know though
you can't like um popper the bottom it
just is all material do you know what I
actually think is the best part of this
bodysuit it is really high leg and I
love high leg basically the side bits
like the side leg bit sit on your hips
and they kind of like push your hips in
it gives you that shape this is cute as
hell honestly you can get so much wear
out this because like I said you can
wear it in the bedroom you can also wear
it I want a bow mine is in a size small
and it was 20 pounds which like I said
for something you can get so much wear
out of is so good also it's why I love
white white looks good on everybody is
such a go classic color good-old-boy
speaking of white I have a little set
here and it's all they see again this
one is definitely more like a bralette
star though as you can kind of tell from
the cups they go all the way up to the
shoulders really as you can see there is
no like carpet just is the material I
really really love the shape of this
bralette it's really really flowering on
again it's one of those the cups kind of
sit a little bit further apart from each
other than an average bra the back is
this is like an elasticated waist band
if that helps because you can't actually
adjust it so just know that it is
elasticated and then of course you can
adjust like the shoulder straps there
and then the bottoms oh well they're
pretty much like the same sort of vibe
there there's this white lace like this
and it is a thong as well now typically
I'm not really into the shape of
underwear as in the front I feel like it
has a bit
like too much coverage to what I
normally like I know me I prefer if it
was more like this rather than this if
that makes sense but why I can mess with
these is because they are kind of
high-waisted they sit higher than normal
so it kind of doesn't look like there is
as much coverage I don't know if that
makes any sense but you can buy these
little guys separately which is awesome
and they come in size 6 8 10 this one I
got mine both in a size 8 the bra is 10
and the bottoms were 8 pounds so 18
pound for this set on to the very very
last thing from pretty little thing now
this is something like really high this
is really different for me I don't know
we get lingerie that has prints Anya I'm
more into like lace or mesh you know
more texture than prints but I saw this
and maybe because it's a tin and maybe
because it's pink I don't know but I
just think it's like really cute as you
can tell this is definitely like a
bralette it's hot I'm not gonna lie
they're they're cups on this or a lil
bit strange like they've kind of you see
that done like a really weird shape this
fits like it doesn't not fit but it just
has like this extra material on the
outside they should have like made it
more of like a triangle like that rather
than having this extra material bar just
to let you guys know in case it comes
and you have like extra bits amiss here
at the side here and you're like so
that's the only bad thing about this but
it's still cute I don't know why I just
left the floral pad on it and I'm not a
floral girl annoyingly this is another
piece that you can't adjust the back all
the straps by it does have an
elasticated back so maybe just kind of
consider that and then the bottoms I
love that triangle shape again they have
that elasticated waist band which is
amazing it's really comfortable to wear
and then the back hopefully you can see
this it's like symmetrical to the front
imagine if a thong and a Brazilian had a
baby this is the kind of star you'd get
it is more of a thong but it's not as
much just like pop your bum
this is the most expensive item but
obviously you can kind of tell it will
be because it's satin and it has a print
on it oh they call it blossom printed I
love the web blossom it's really pretty
the top is 12 on the bottom is 10 so
that's 22 pounds I actually think that's
worth it because this is a one-off piece
for me like I won't probably have
anything else in my lingerie like this
is something totally different I'm
probably the only thing I'm gonna have
so it's worth spending comfortable
pounds on it yeah that is everything
from PLT last but by no means least we
are on to a Primark good old pry money
they've come up with some cool things
for the whole like Valentine's Day thing
and they've like stepped it up this is
the first set so it's a really cute
black and nude bra I am obsessed with
the colors what I really really love
about it though I love the holic thick
bandage straps like they are stretchy I
don't know I just think it's really cool
and then of course you can adjust the
back and the straps also as far as um
the cups go they have a little bit of
padding nothing crazy you know we're not
gonna get like booboo part we're gonna
get and then the bottoms aren't matching
off of course I always have to have
matching bottoms I don't know what it is
they look like this so the whole thick
strappy black / vibe going on as well
same pattern on on the front and then it
is a thong back and it does have a
little cutout here as well which is cute
and then what did I see next to it as
well one of these these cool suspenders
they're basically a thing that sits on
your kind of waist hip area and then
they can hold up some stockings
basically you can add this to this and
make it into like an atty new out there
and like more kind of bedroom
appropriate and I'm here for hey I just
love this I love the color scheme combo
I love the whole vibe of it Primark now
because the bright is a proper you know
cup I got it in 30 to be the underwear
is in a small and so is at this little
guy the bra was a the bottoms before and
the little thing was sick so if I can do
the math you shouldn't try to do Mouse
about calculator 618 just Jordan yes
that's for everything and I mean if you
just want the underwear it's what 12
pounds cells and boys as if that wasn't
enough yeah not only is this gorge like
just looking at it this is the most like
well fitting well fitted body that I
probably have in my collection it's just
so well-made it's super super low cart
I'm pretty sure it comes just above your
belly button you have the little black
elasticated bits around the middle and
then it's got like a lace trim and stuff
the back is mesh and it is a Brazilian
kind of bum the straps at the back cross
over
like that and then they do have this
little bit in the middle so you can
adjust it also like your side boob will
have like this mesh bit it's like half
your boobs in the back and nude half of
its in there I don't know what it is oh
my god I'm stuck I'm stuck I don't know
what it is about this boy okay but it
just fits my body so nicely like it's
really snug on my boobs like it's not
you know when you bend it's not gonna
like get for anything just fits tight
just sucks you in it's just all kinds of
right mine is in a size small and it is
12 pounds I do this set next I think
because it's like a bra and underwear
and then I also have a body to match
like the last one bit of color now how
much I love red red is one of them
colors that looks good on everyone every
skin tone it's just pop in it be poppin
there's also like frilly and girly and
I'm like it just has these cups which
has the smallest amount of putting in by
the way like honestly there's barely
like you can kind of see that just a
little bit little lifts
yes please it's all kind of like lacy
has this really cute bow at the front
and then on the shoulders how cute how
these little frilly bits it's freely at
the back on the bottom now you can see
as well and then the back is kind of
like a racerback I'm not normally into
these kind of backs because like keeping
it real over here this what we do these
are a little bitch to get off like saris
be TMI but like is true and then the
bottoms again Lacey it has a huge bow at
the front and then I really like the
sides there then kind of struck me like
two straps which is really nice to have
said this before but you can pull like
the top strap up above your hips and it
just looks nice and then it's a thong
back as the browser 30p and the bottoms
are a medium in Primark there can be a
small or a medium I just kind of like
hold them up and see I think I'd be here
the bra was a and the underwear was 3
pounds 2 8 9 10 11 and then yeah like I
said I do have a body so much this is
this little guy here hello as you can
see the whole thing is mesh and lace
it's really really low-cut again it
comes above your belly buttons I've got
some like a little boob action going on
still got the bow on there it's just in
the middle around the waist the back is
again that racerback style and it is a
Brazilian and it does have poppers which
and thankful for I don't know what it is
I just love a good Papa I just really
like the whole saw of lace trim around
it as well like on the bomb and the
boobs my decimal and it style pounds I
don't know if you can tell but Primerica
pretty consistent with their price is so
like their bodies are typically around
the 12 power mark and like for a whole
set of underwear so typically around
like the eleven twelve thirteen pound
mark the very last thing in this hole
now again it is something red because
like I said you can't go wrong with red
but this is a totally different style
for me I'm whipping up the new styles in
this haul I don't think I've ever owned
something like this but I saw it and I
thought you know what I don't have
something so why not try it this is a
baby doll if you don't know what baby
doll is it's basically like a little
dress you can see that huh I love this
one cuz not only do I love like the mesh
little flowy skirt there I love this
detail in the middle at the crossover
bit here
you can adjust the straps as well by the
way I don't know what it is okay about
this but this top half this bit here
fits so nicely it really hugs my boobs
like it really fits you know anything
which is nice because obviously you've
got no support whatsoever and then
Primark providing the goods it comes
with a matching thong as well like
actually you buy them together like it
comes together same design going on it's
a thong and you know what for both of
this like this comes together it's only
ten pounds like I don't know how they do
it mine's in a size small as well by the
way I just love this I'm so chuffed with
the bits like aw I'm so excited to put
some under on I feel like a new woman
