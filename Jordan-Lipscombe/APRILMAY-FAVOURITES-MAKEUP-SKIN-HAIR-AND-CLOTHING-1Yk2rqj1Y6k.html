/ May safe today I'm kind of too late
for one - ready for the others laughter
kind of like put them together I thought
so kind of spruce up a little bit I
would include not only my makeup
favorites but maybe skin hair clothing
basically whatever the hell I want
I don't know I thought it'd be cool
rather than me just sitting here
stirring a bunch of makeup that you are
kind of do something a little different
I'm going to try it to not babble too
much kind I want to keep it short and
snappy you know we're not sitting here
for like a lifetime so let's start with
makeup because I know I love you and
here for that this first favorite is
actually going to be no surprise because
I wrote about them so much on my channel
but the iconic illuminating drops I felt
personally myself I love to use it as a
base to powder highlights because I do
like to set this in place but honestly
you don't need to do that that's just me
being extra because I'm OTT with a
highlighter sorry not sorry
where this is liquid as well it just
melts into your skin and gives you that
wet skin look like floral you can use a
really small amount and really blend in
to give you like a subtle glow or you
can just pile it on my garden so yeah I
won't talk about it too much because I
have gone in depth with them on my
channel before so if you do want to see
that I will leave that video linked
below but yeah your clinic illuminating
jobs by the way mine is the original
shade which is morphe like golden tone
one love it as this next thing is the
makeup revolution ultra pro HD cream
contour palette now not gonna lie I've
always been a powder contour girl cream
just never mix well with nails like I
don't have the skin type for exercise
quite oily skin always looks muddy on me
I just use just trust me I hope on my
friends creme console and it always
looks so saban anyways it's so good so I
had to have to give it a go I found this
one in my makeup collection that I
hadn't used and I have not put this down
formula it's perfect it's like creamy
enough that you can read lend in easily
but it's not overly creamy like it kind
of melts into your skin all those muddy
or patchy or anything also sort of a
news earnest of most it gives my face so
much more definition and it makes me
look so much fun time like a neutral
term and it's drugstore it's honestly
such a good cream contour palette I have
the lights of medium one by the way if
you are interested and I use this shade
the most here because it's the most warm
toned which tends to suit my skin tone
better but yes that's why I had to
pretty good money okay so so many of you
asked me what my go-to eyeshadow palette
is definitely this like past couple
months has to be rescue the packaging on
complex so good everyone if so we look
at a little such a few dots I don't
belong you guys this is the about it
boss Holy Grail I should open it and
honestly this is a bit of me if I ever
got the opportunity to make a motion
palette like these kind of tones would
be in it because this is the eyeshadow
palette that has like every single I
should have kind of that i would need
personally have my black does another
back we've got like Burgundy's browns
goals oranges neutrals nudes you have
literally literally everything of course
the form of these are really nice is are
really easy to bend really easy to use
but yeah for sure this is one of my
favorite I should oppose I own hands
down I have been loving glitter this
past month like I wanted to use in all
of my makeup looks like all the time I
besides testing the waters with some
clear some glitter glue as well and NYX
NYX took that cake they took that slice
there yet they did it not only is that
glitter amazing this is your face and
body glitter like look how big the plots
are as well if you lost you pages I love
these colors this one here is bronze and
this one is copper this is one that
might be wearing on their eyes today and
not really start but their glitter
primer is the best like glitter glue I
have ever used just like a thick paste
rather than a glue which I prefer
because I find it's not as messy and
it's easier to apply
stop split or fallout stops it from
creasing makes it last really long it
sticks really well what more can I say
they have loads of colors as well if you
are spoilt for choice for sure but yeah
if you last glare like me kinder girls I
have a couple of lipsticks to show you
lipsticks are for your most favorite
makeup items along with highlighter
tyrannous liquid lipsticks now our 2004
ones for the first time at this month
and holy crap my friends Hollyer swears
by these and she's like Jordan if there
is anything you need to try from Oprah
it is l équipe cigs along with our
highlighters but you guys know I I
literally swear by the highlighters they
like the best they don't dry out your
lips like my nips don't end up looking
like a bum holiday like i'm lucy formula
and they're really pigmented so even the
darker colors aren't touchy
just comfortable to wear they drive down
nicely they last and really
I'm literally no complains spare 28 Alan
I copy
Atlantic City and it's like a red-eye
Finn lover at the moment as this
Isabella which is such a pretty news
over a provides the news they have so
many nude lipstick colors which I
literally am element over a liquid
lipsticks give them a go you won't
regret it and I have to give a little
mention to this L'Oreal lip paint this
is when their maps ones from their
nudists Rangers Cali and particular is
my fav this is two array off-white so be
honest the reason why I love these so
much is this color this is the perfect
like soft baby pink which is like my
favor I'm actually wearing this article
goes on top the color is so nice
the folder is nice as well if you don't
like a liquid lipstick then maybe try
these up because these don't dry down at
all and they're not actually done that
are st. Ignace and more like a satin
finish but I mean if you put like a bit
of translucent powder at the top they
would be that but yeah if you don't like
a liquid lipstick there to drive see or
whatever maybe try this because it's so
hydrating and they're really comfortable
I don't know it's up to you but I wanted
to share with you guys can I be wearing
it a lot come on with all the locks you
know it's not so about this month's oh
look it's my phone screen now onto a
body bit so 40 bits okay this I would do
it but minute stick if you love to glow
like all here just everywhere you will
love this any time where I've got like
this area or I can also shot a top on
this goes like everywhere else you've
got your legs out down your shins this
would look this would look hot this is
the cocoa brown golden goddess
shimmering dry body oil it literally is
what it says so it is a dry oil so it
does dry down it's not going to stay
like wet or tacky kind of feeling and it
is shimmery so like from a distance you
look wet so good and even close up it
have like your shimmery bits in it it
looks so good I pretty much have been
drowning myself in this since I got it
like anything I like a bit of skins on
char like it's just so pretty it leaves
your skin looking so glowy so healthy
not to mention it's just not like apples
so you just give it a shape give it a
shimmy yeah I have that pump as well so
it's super easy application I
put on the back of my hand take a stick
and brush and just go home go home so
you might be thinking what the hell is
that
literally let's talk about to start like
paint them all but but this is the most
genius thing okay
okay Honda the most genius invention
ever like for all my people who love
Phaeton ins like myself
you'll be so thankful for this if I know
so many of you think when I think
turning how the hell do I reach my back
colles easy so you can use this to a
player's hand all over your body I
mainly use it for my back so we honest
because that's where like I struggle
with the most actually feels so good
this is by the tanning brand called
skinny tan I've never tried their times
I've just for the applicator and I like
snatched it up it just makes tanning so
much more convenient so much easier I
don't know where I was without this and
this is so soft like I shouldn't do that
for of my makeup this just has been my
favorite this is like the best thing I
bought like I can reach places I could
never reach before this lasting care
thing I preach I've mentioned it before
I definitely have over my snapchat but I
wanted to do on my youtube channel for
like the bigger audience because I feel
like for breakout this is going to like
figure out this is the Amero of a desk
you trying lotion and this is the best
thing I have ever used for breakouts I
promise you game-changer this works for
them like horrible under the skin lumps
which I'm actually spots are just there
like this bruise lumps and you're like
this will helps like shrink that down
completely or if you've got a blemish
that you popped put it on it boosting a
little bit it will sting a little bit it
will help to dry out so it obviously
heals up wake up there's basically a
pink powder at the bottom and then
there's like this clear liquid on top
you don't mix them together don't do
that you just take a cotton bud dip it
into the pink powder and just apply it
where you need it and just let it do a
sting this is honestly incredible like
smell so no complaint no Ghazala to this
is the best thing I've ever tried for
breakouts and I've tried a lot of things
trust me but this is a better stick
favor I have is a hair product this is
the child works in volume and balance
perfect finish hairspray now the reason
I want to share this with you is because
when I went to the Busters at the
weekend which by the way that has to be
a favor as well like it was insane
insane
remembering Charles Worthington actually
it is my hair for me and how to pretty
much how I have it now but just like
down straight and they use this
hairspray so basically like came down on
the flyaways keep it in place and I've
never had a hairspray keep my hair in
place for that long like ever I use it
today no it actually doesn't feel overly
crispy it just was like a really nice
hold the best part about this though
this brushes out brushes out take a
brush to it if gold put in a little more
wine off oops not good the best
hairspray I've ever tried like it hold
but it's not like only crispy you can
brush it out that was the chair by the
way I didn't just fall by the way this
is just like so many sample size to do
of course coming like the big ones which
I will be getting because I feel like
I've no need it I need it I actually
have a new favorite perfume that I've
discovered so going to fast off the
packaging is insane I'm such a sucker
for packaging like if something looks
good sometimes I just get it cuz it
looks good but I didn't just get this
because a little bit like it smells it's
in the shape of a can like wow so that's
so cool wasn't actually misguided
fragrant sicily babe power the de parfum
poor babe parfum for babe's I'm not a
babe but like after where it basically
only what the only way I can describe it
is it's just really really sweet if you
like sweet fragrances your love this if
you hate it don't even go near it
it's probably like this sweet as part
time of of a smell I can't remember what
it's called when a person's like this
but all the ingredients in here are
actually edible
obviously there's alkaloid here's a boat
don't try and eat this don't do that
there's just like fruits and like
candies awesome stuff in there it's so
nice so like go look at this cess go get
this a smell so I have some clothes and
favorites because you guys know I love
clothes I love shopping I can't help
myself
skin problems I might need to like my
first place and favorite has to be this
is just going to be impossible to show
you and it's so happy like my arms
holding this up I like see ya so I will
insert a photo like here maybe like any
minute now
just like the power of editing like good
has to include the dress I wore to the
Busters in my favorites because how
often do you get
we're such a pretty dress like something
that's really cigar again to the floor
when I go to this bar Instagram so many
of you asked me where it's from and it's
from house of CV now the material of
house of CB dresses is in same is that
amazing bandage stretcher material which
is like my favorite materials I have in
dresses because it just figure hugs you
without being too tight but it just you
get that shape yeah no it has to be the
most glamorous dress I've ever worn in
my life I mean I'm only 19 but yeah
we're about to go from one extreme to
the other here we've gone like glamorous
al - like cash-only got this the other
day but this little cropped pink adidas
top I love it I love crop things I love
the color I like the pink I should have
a copy of trips coming up and those yb4
twice like I'm so lucky so I needed some
more kind of like cooler items of
clothing I do have a copy someone
costumes to show you in a second and I'm
going to either crap out of this and by
the way I get from Topshop top ashabi
well ask you face are swimming questions
I feel like this year for me is going to
be swimming costumes as opposed to
bikinis I don't know why I've just been
like digging them this first one so like
sports vibe this is from Topshop and
it's just obviously a red
swim costume my mind went blank then and
then at the back is like a scoop in for
some questions as well you can just
treat them like a bodysuit and wear them
like day to day you guys know I've been
loving read recently so as soon as I saw
this I was like you can see out off the
first one and then the second one is
from H&amp;amp;M and this is again quite like
sports see I guess looks like this just
this nude and black swimming costume but
this one is like the same at the back
but it's going to say it for the front
which if I can there we go so - feel the
heat as well I didn't even notice that
actually I just love the color and how
different it was with as if I haven't
really seen any swimming costumes like
this so if you I'm actually so ready for
someone else like I want to whack these
out okay so they are my favorites
