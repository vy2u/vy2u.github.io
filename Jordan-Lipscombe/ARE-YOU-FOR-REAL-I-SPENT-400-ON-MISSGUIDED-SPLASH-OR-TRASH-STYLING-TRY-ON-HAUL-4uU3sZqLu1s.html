realistically I hasn't even been that
long I think it's been like two weeks
but because I've know I shoulda been a
home I've been away she was like so much
longer but it's cool because I can't
even better come back with a quote hey
boys and girls it's Jordan hopefully so
recognize me today we are carrying on
though with the testing clothing brands
series to be honest with you I'm pretty
sure you all know what happens in these
kind of videos because everyone does
them and I'm not mad at it cuz he's one
of my favorite videos to watch and film
but how these videos work over here
you know I basically get clothes
accessories whatever from one clothing
brand and we test them out together to
see whether it's worth spending your
money on but no I need to I try them on
so you can see the fit the quali all of
that I also stole them so you can you
know maybe get a lot bit inspo for me or
you know just see how I would pair in an
outfit I mean if I can't style an item
and I'm never gonna wear it so anyway
let's do it the last brand that I tested
out was boohoo if you haven't seen it I
will leave it in the eye here and I will
also link it below but today ladies and
gents today today we are putting
misguided to the test
I know misguided is a well-known popular
clothing brown I'm sure you me everyone
by some misguided a lot of their stuff
is right up my street it looks fab but
is if I'm in real life
we're bout find out together I did
purchase all of these things with my own
money and it was nearly four hundred
pounds there's a lot of money right I'm
equip boring you with the intro and
let's get into showing you these pieces
let's do it right so I have been loving
a good cord like a denim jacket denim
skirt I don't know what it is you can
throw on look put together it's just my
jam it's my chance when I saw this on
misguided I was like I need to test you
out they need to test you
they love me so we have a black denim a
little skirt kind of situation here and
it has contrast stitching so all the
stitching on it is white which really
really drew me and that's what kind of
like made this piece for me is gonna
sound kind of way but it's like a really
nice denim do you know what I mean like
it's not really stiff have you had some
denim that's really stiff and you're
like well it feels really really nice in
the jacket this didn't come with it you
did have to buy it separately which I
really like because you know
sizes on top so we are off to the but
basically top bottom with differences so
it's just a black denim jacket literally
the same design the contrast stitching
to the white stitching all over it is
not cropped or anything eva is just a
normal kind of denim jacket length
that's what the back looks like what the
front side but you know when you see
something in the modern you're like yeah
I need you so sizing and prices for the
skirt is stuck to my size a size a and
then it was 22 pounds and then the
jacket I actually got a size 6 in this
mainly because a size 8 was out of stock
it was 40 pounds which for a denim
jacket really isn't that bad at all so
the whole poor together was I'm not
gonna mass 62 pounds which I'm gonna
keep it really you guys I have paid more
for little cord before that's the first
piece and let's roll the little triangle
I love it there's no cord is so me like
so me as you love it I think it's just
so cool cash this is cool I'm definitely
not cool like but this this is cool it
all fits really really nicely the only
thing is the sky at the teeny teeny bit
big but I'm nothing about convicts and
to be honest that happens with me all
the time because I like to wear things
like really really high waisted and so
you know the big the denim is that
really nice immovable if you know any me
like I don't feel like a board I decided
to pair it with this little plain black
is actually crop top but I just like
talking this is from H&amp;amp;M and then I'm so
excited over these trainers okay they're
like my little babies these are Nike Air
Max 95 I believe I can't always keep
everything really really simple so that
the statement was morphe 2-piece this
haul is going off to a fab Frank Inc I
actually love it like obviously you guys
knew in your life I'll just do this
piece next because honestly it is
exactly the same as the last one but
colors are reversed I don't know why I
have this thing if I really like
something it is in another color I have
to get the other color my bank account
hates me
so Jackie there was a little bit
different so this guy is just a white
denim with the contrast black stitching
it pretty much is exactly the same as
the black one but the jacket this time
instead of it
a you know normal length it actually is
cropped you can kind of see it's like
they've like just cut it with some
scissors but the actual style of it is
pretty much exactly the same as you can
kind of see I just love the contrast
stitching I think it's so cool oh and
also to point out it's like an off-white
color it's not like white the Scout I
got in a size that again and it was the
same at 22 pounds their jacket however
was a little bit but probably because I
hover this is gone this was actually 25
pounds which is really cool and the size
is a size 6 again this actually is a
little bit bigger than the black denim
Jack has a bit more like really Jordan
my explanations guys this was 47 pounds
altogether which that's an absolute box
right let's see how it looks on here is
the white version well I say a white
version this is actually a little bit
different jack is actually crops
but it is pretty much like the same
thing though I decided to go like all
white I was gonna break up with a little
bit of color which I still think you
could totally do but I was just like my
top is just like a little tesha which
I've tucked in from cats got the cream
it just says whatever I like it because
it's got black rhino so it kind of ties
in with the black stitching and then for
shoes you guessed it of course the Air
Force Ones and I actually think I might
prefer the cropped jacket rather than
the longer one I don't know though I
like both to be honest if the question
you want to ask me right now is which
one would I choose between the two I
don't know all I can say is if this
whole carries on like this then a
misguided is the 100% a thumbs up from
me like this top is so cute
you know something so cute you want to
put on right now me why I'm so excited
by this I don't know I just I love it we
have a little white crop top
short-sleeved and it says Nikki Nikki
Nikki know you want to see me Nikki
Nikki Nikki the ones that I have with
white like tops trousers in any form is
that half the time they are see-through
and it's rider than me insane in the
membrane I just like don't understand
like Kenobi once we sing the junk in the
trunk all the apples in the bags you
know what I mean but this actually
a little bit of a thicker cotton I still
feel like you migh have to wear a white
bra I wish to be honest with you I would
do that anyway this is my tops as well
it's gonna go so much it's gonna be like
a used piece in my wardrobe I'm excited
I'm not only a slogan kind of girl
normally but this just tickled the
pickle on the model it was more like a
look at me hung up on the model it was
more of a naturally fitted up top and
that's exactly the look that I wanted so
I stuck to my size a size a and it was
to do 15 pounds which I don't think
that's a bad price that's pretty like
average to me know you want to see me
naked naked naked that somebody stuck my
head now RiRi what you're doing to me I
love this top so much look at here size
8 definitely the perfect size it fits
exactly how I'd run it see like nice and
tight but not like uncomfortable tight
and full on my armpits are getting like
cut into on-camera does look it's heaney
bitsy for I have caught a little white
bra but I'm aware that it does look a
little bit see-through
I have two huge softbox lights in front
of me so it kind of like enhances it it
teeny bit more so like real life
lighting it's fine I mean don't get me
wrong you can't wear like a bright pink
bar under here like it has to be white
but white bra you get to go this is one
of those tops of me that you kind of
like thrown away for more like cash kind
of outfit like everyday so I've gone for
black jeans from Primark I'm pretty sure
this fluffy this is from boohoo and then
why I didn't work why Air Force Ones
which I live in I would 100% recommend
this little guy if you beautiful bunch
have been on misguided recently they've
come up with a few new collections
they've done loads of stuff they come up
with these like Yeezy inspired clothes
they've also done a collab with I'm
pretty sure or blogger and they also did
a little collection with Umbro and don't
worry I got a little bit from every
collection so they kind of like Yeezy
collection I saw this and I was like it
is another little cardi thing so I will
show them together cuz I'd wear them
together first piece is this really cool
I guess this is kind of like acid wash
grey oversized top
honestly the comfiest thing ever yeah
house like a really no stretch to it
feels nice anyway and then you can also
get these little
cycling shorts which as you can see are
in the exact same print as you can see
on the model it's like not long enough
to be a t-shirt dress but it comes to
that got really
let's that looks really cool with the
cycling shorts they kind of like peek
through as far as sizing and prices go
wow this was not expensive at all I
stuck to my sizing the top a size eight
and it was only 15 pounds and then as
far as the shorts go I actually got
these in a 10 because they didn't have
an 8 in stock and that's how badly I
wanted it I was like f it would just get
the 10 and these were only 12 pounds so
ten twenty five six seven 27 mounds for
this set I'm so excited for this I'm so
excited this is literally the comfiest
thing I own I swear I literally love
everything about this I love the fit I
love how like oversized and just like it
is I love the colors I love the style
and of the vibe this is just me this is
me I would wear them together like this
you know as the cord but you could
totally you know where the top
separately where the little shorts
separately for sure
I love the whole like effect of the top
as well like I love the whole like acid
wash Marbley situation even though I did
get a 10 in these shorts I still think
they fit really well like this still
still look good Oh sexy 360 360 this is
how I started I love them look at this
with some I've got some black stock
boots on from I saw it first
I don't even wear this with some like
white trainers or something so you know
my cash up even more this is definitely
one of my favorite things in this haul
like hands down touching the floor so
this I would 100% recommend like take
the money like I said earlier misguided
have collabed with I think she's a
blogger I really don't know I've just
seen on Instagram someone whose room but
she's called funny like Minh I think
that's how you pronounce her name but
I'm really bad with names so in research
I pitched today and her collection I'm
not gonna lie is really really cool and
I saw these white leggings I've been
after have like white leggings or white
bottoms in some form for the longest
time
but always see-through and like I said
my brain can't I don't know I don't get
it but these are actually called like
Vantage leggings and I was like oh they
can we really go coolly like they're not
gonna be see-through
they are literally just white leggings
there's not much to show you guys but
they're really really nice and high
waisted which is nice you know suck
everything in
100% stuck to my size with these there
are size a and these weren't cheap like
I'm pretty sure these are the most I've
ever spent on leggings and they were 30
pounds
she looks so calling the picture I an
all-white outfit I absolutely love it as
soon as I open these though I noticed
something are these worth 30 pounds
let's just go to the Tron clip so I can
show you guys know I purposely put on
white underwear and look how see-through
this still is guys these are 30 pounds
look I don't think you can really see
them at the back because these are a
thong
can you or you cut a little bit actually
I put this top with it just so this part
of me is actually but I'm not gonna
bother it's like stardom and stuff
because honestly they are going back
it's a shame because the actual leggings
are really really tight like they fit
really really nicely there are really
nice length as well like they're not too
long now I thought I would love the
bandage material honestly for leggings I
don't like yeah they show every single
number bump on your body like lumps and
bumps that you didn't even know is that
if I stand back far enough can you guys
see how lumpy my knees look it's made a
lump like here as well underneath my
cheek I just I can't get over this can
we but honestly this is no shade towards
funny like them in herself in no way
shape or form these keeping it real over
here we're just keeping it real
these just aren't why expect it for 30
pounds so overall yeah these are
definitely not from me they're gonna go
back they did it again I saw something I
left on the website and I had it in a
couple of colors and I got both I did
that because you know we have a lot of
faith that something's gonna come and
you're gonna love it like that was this
I am so I was just like can I just say I
have no real power and no strength when
it comes to buying clothes it's actually
a little bit of a problem I feel like a
need to go to therapy generally minami
like hi my name is Jordan and I'm I'm
addicted to wine clothes these are so
cool oh my god I've been loving cargo
pants at the moment I think they look so
cool I've been seeing them like all over
Instagram and stuff and I think you know
what let me see if I can like pull them
off please look so fab so they're black
cargo pants
as you can see the fit of them is kind
of like a jogger vibe so they're not
tight to it all they're more like a
loose bar at the ankles they have a
little elasticated band so you know it
kind of brings it in to give a little
bit more shape they have pockets on the
side which give it look a bit like a
military vibe I think it's so cool of
course they're high-waisted I never wear
anything that's not high-waisted to be
honest but then as you can see the
material there are actually sat in
there's also pockets on the bum as well
these look Thunderbird or Z they feel
really really soft like the quality
feels nice which they should be because
these were a little bit pricey
these were 40 pounds which but it's a
little bit pricier but I'm more than
happy to pay that if they fit nicely and
they look nice they're kind of that like
statement outfit piece I got a size 8 in
these as well by the way let's put it
together in the laughing so I will pull
the camera down in like two SEC's to
show you the trousers like in full
length of course just to give you an
idea on an outfit and how I would kind
of style it I flippin love these
trousers they are just like a teeny bit
tight here I don't know if the cameras
picking it up but like just around my
kind of like fun top half area they're
like a teeny bit tight nothing like
uncomfortable though like I still feel
like I can like do activities and then
they are like a teeny teeny teeny bit
loose around my waist so I just put belt
with it but I'm totally cool with that I
would probably do that anyway but
literally I pass on that they fit
perfectly everywhere else the length is
really really nice
as far as styling guys this is the kind
of look I'd go for kind of like all
black so I've gone for this black caddy
desktop I think it's better been
Outfitters online toys it's not actually
mine it's actually my sister so shout
with you it's like a normal length top
of just like tucked in this belt from
Urban Outfitters which I don't speak is
this French so I don't know actually
what this is but I just feel like it
matches with the top and then I've gone
for myself boots for my short fuzzball
not the bomb I feel like these pants
need a bit of heel just so I don't look
so like stumpy and little let me move
you down so you can see them excuse like
weird angle this is literally all I can
like yeah but you see what I mean about
the bottom like the legs and stuff it
all just works out perfectly here's the
back if you want to see them
as well these are definitely the best
cargo pants that I've tried on I've
tried on loads before and none of them
are like quite right and these doesn't
fit exactly how I want them to some of
them make me look like I've got like two
like tree trunks as legs but these ones
these are all good like I said same item
different color but it really is color
this time so I feel like they look like
a completely different items you ever
get that we have a cute little pinky
nude color this time literally the exact
same item cargo pants same everything
same pockets same everything apparently
apparently apparently no me on live
television before someone needs to stop
me same price 40 same size size a I
don't know though I feel like these
because they're like a nudey pink
they're a little more girly
I feel like they're gonna be a
completely different vibe to the black
ones for sure like I can see the black
bones in it all black I'll say in this
one I can see me with white or something
completely different type thanks my
excuse
here are the pink ones on they fit
exactly like the black ones I definitely
think that white goes with this color
like perfectly I paired it with this
white little crop from pre old thing the
belt which is from Primark I kind of
wish the belt was maybe a lighter color
not black or something it goes but I
just I don't know and then white little
booties from Nasty go next up we have
this cute little Umberto I literally
live for these like old school brands
like Umbro Fila like I love it I just
think they're so cool so when I saw me
scared I'd come out with a little
collection with ombre I had to get my
little hands on it I did only pick up
one piece though and it's this little
black crop top long sleeves I love the
item bro
design on the sleeve with like the Reds
I also love the fact I was like a little
bit of a high neck as well and by the
way the crop isn't like crop do you know
what I mean it's like a long crop the
feel of this that they call a honestly
is amazing like this is how a little top
like this should be sized I'm pricing I
wanted it to be nice and you know
tightened fit it to my skin so I got a
size small and it was 28 pounds which
for like a brand if you know I mean is
pretty normal you pay that Nike Nike
Nike Nike tomato tomahto I'm excited to
style this let's try it on here's the
Umbra top
so be honest with you it fits and looks
exactly how I expected it fits really
really nice and tie it is like I said
normal long crop so you can actually
have like no skin tummy on show I
decided to pair it with my black sugars
that I love from the booboo I feel like
it kind of complements the whole like
sporty by but I don't know just gives me
sports for some reason I'm just obsessed
with there's I think it's so fab I love
the fact that was his back and white so
you can wear tons of colors were there
and there's also like a little bit right
in here if you can see that so like you
could add a little bit right and then
for shoes I've gone with these pointed
toe boots from boohoo just so I like
dress up the jobless to be honest this
is definitely I feel like if you like
your branded stuff then you're gonna
love the Ambro range for sure I love it
so it gets a thumbs up from me I'm
actually going to switch this up a
little bit and show you some shoes I got
normally from misguided I get like boots
heels that kind of vibe when it comes to
trainers I never normally do it ok I
mean this in the lease like way as
possible when it comes to trainers
because I really absolute out of them
like I need something that's gonna be
super comfy really durable so I normally
like to pay that a little bit more and
actually get branded trainers but I saw
these and I've never seen anything like
them
oh my god it smells like newness you
know that like newness oh my god these
are so cute it's like I am actually
obsessed
I love the design the writing on the
sole not the sole definitely love soul
cuz that's a saw the writing on this
part is so cool these weren't expensive
after working they were like 25 pounds
and keeping it real with you guys you
can kind of tell visually you can't tell
it looking at them UV light no cool for
the actual feel of them and the insides
and stuff isn't the best quality ever
but they're not the worst even they're
like fine they're kind of like you can
tell they're gonna be comfy but they're
not gonna be as comfy as mine Ikes you
know let's see if you can kind of like
see what I mean so the actual trainer is
like kind of flimsy a little bit it's
fine no like I'm not complaining at all
and as you can see in the inside there's
no padding or anything whatsoever so
we're not going to be feeling like we're
walking on clouds today but I think it's
about 425 pounds
this'll cool man like they actually look
like you know they're not gonna hurt my
feet Eva also who the writing I didn't
even say what it says it says I love
this it says this is not designer all
over it
they ain't trying to fool no one with
these trainer this is not as for sizing
by the way I got a size 5 which is my
normal size and they fit perfectly so
they are true to size they're so cute
yeah hi
these are juicy okay we're after about
this next piece set this looked so hot
on the model she looked so good it was
one of those dresses which the color was
hot the fit looked amazing it just was
like that dress that every girl and boy
wants however the quality of this for
the price misguided huns
miss guided I love you just for one
about to say I'm gonna try it on and
stuff to put it in perspective for you
guys the price of this was 35 pounds
which it's one of the more pricier at
dresses that's not far off they're like
premium range I mean the color is
beautiful it's like a burn orange which
looks amazing on all skin tones this is
just so thin I wish you guys I wish we
had like touch a vision because right
now I'd be like guys just have a little
feel it's really nice and silky but it's
just so like thin and that is not gonna
support the boobies in any way shape or
form because this is quite a low-cut
piece so your nips are gonna be out and
about loving life there's this really
cute like ruching bit around the middle
to you know give you a little bit of
shape and then on the leg is it this
side yeah there is a little slit as you
can see oh and by the way I got the size
I would get in every single dress a size
eight I have tried this piece on because
I did buy it to plan to wear it
somewhere and the fit of it is so like
awkward it's like loose in places
tightened places makes me like a go a
little bit of a time which I'm not
saying I don't you know that food baby
is I want about and proud it's just on
this for anything and for the quality
for the price and stuff I just wasn't
that impressed I felt like I should have
got way more I expected more than what I
got
I'm sorry misguided are saying the try
and clip that this
yes just does not fit properly but from
a distance it probably looks fine right
now you're thinking what's wrong with
there how I thought I can't move my
necks because if I do this is gonna like
split even oh this is so freaking time
I'm like I do have a barn as well
because the material is so thin you'll
see like all kinds of nips actually sad
about this because the color is
beautiful just the fit is kind of like a
little bit weird I don't have the
biggest boobs in the world but the top
half fits fine
this middle bits a little bit strange
like kind of makes me look like have a
little bit of a belly from the front it
sticks out all this extra with your way
I don't understand and this bottom half
is pulling it so tired I know ever it's
my bum I don't have like a big bum or
anything but it's just so tight-lipped
like I can't I can't move this anymore
like there's no way I feel like one
dance move gone guilt even though it is
really pretty and I'm a little bit hard
to say this the fit just isn't working
for me so I wouldn't I wouldn't
recommend this I actually forgot I got
these oh I love me a good earring I now
have so many so you're gonna see a
little different earrings coming up I
just think they add a little something
to an outfit and I saw these ones on
misguided and I thought they were so
cute so they are these cute little love
hearts and in the love heart it says
love and they kind of like to sit on
your ear like this so from the side you
can read it they are gold as well which
I'm normally actually a silver girl but
I've been loving a bit more of gold
recently and as you can see there were
six pounds I'm not even joking these are
a solid like metal so like I need to go
down the gym more to break these I'm
gonna put one in let's try it let's try
it honestly finding your ear hole it's
like the most awkward thing ever
wait Wow
I love these how cute are these why do
they actually look better than the hoop
I'm wearing right now I mean I better
take it out so that I don't know how do
you different earrings weave back to
normal if you've been around for a
little while you'll know that I never
wear midi suchlike longer
dresses because I feel like they make me
look really stubby I'm not short girl
I'm like five foot five which is pretty
average but I have like shorter legs and
like real savvy expert in my wardrobe I
really really worn
a nice maxi midi dress you know like the
really long ones that come like just
above your ankle I feel like they look
so classy you can dress them up dress
them down I don't know I have got
nothing like it and I really really want
to try it oh I just realized this is
actually part of the Carli bybel
collection didn't even realize this is
the one I chose so I don't know if you
can tell but it's like kind of one
shoulders kind of a fan one is a cross
long-sleeved and then it goes all the
way down to you know kind of like in
between your shin in between notion like
halfway down your shin it's a Rip's
material as well and it's like super
stretchy like super stretchy makes room
for my food baby the color fits like a
Beijing nude I would say on the model I
loved how you know she had like a little
bit of skin showing up here but
everything else was covered and it's
body con as well so it was nice and fit
so you can see her shape I just think
it's kind of sexy mine's in a uk8 yeah
but I actually feel like because of the
stretchiness I may have been able to get
a six we'll see and this was only 18
pounds which is an absolute boggs like
that is like a good dress price do you
know what I mean this and new strappy
Hills is a look and I'm excited to put
it together
right so this dress is definitely a
little bit see-through as you can see
it's like a thin stretching with Hiro
though so I'm not gonna lie I was kind
of expecting that in fact you know what
I'm gonna take my underwear off for
nurse has a little crazy I genuinely
think I'd go out and wear this dress
with no underwear where it's so long I'm
not like risking showing a vagina or
anything let me just do that one second
that is so much better I actually really
really like this I feel so light it's
like a woman in this dress
and I feel like one shoulder off one
shoulder on thing I feel like it's
really elegant I freaking love the color
as well it's gonna go with so so much
and you know what surprisingly I'm kind
of obsessed with the length it's really
really hard to show you the night
because I'm having stomach all the way
back here but you can actually kind of
see in the mirror he comes like just
below my knees it is so pretty or what
I've had these Hills whether these are
from Bukit there's a little jewels on
the ankle strap actually loved this way
more than I even thought I would Oh
ignore the label that like ruins the
short but it's so pretty though and you
know I like about it being stretchy is
that I can move you know like some mini
dresses are really restricting and you
all quick
she like okay yep I just remember to
have this jacket and I feel like hitting
my dog who's this like classy girl oh my
god this is like full-on like I'm going
on a date with Maddie my women find a
woman I'm a Miss Jackie I got some
misguided ages ago as well it's official
I'm obsessed my office this dress this
dress this dress this gets listed at
nine out of ten because everything is
perfect spot from the fact it's a little
bit safer but I would still recommend it
so I think this is the last thing yeah I
picked this up because I need something
like this in my wardrobe just to like go
with anything and everything it is a
white bodysuit does it open at the
bottom yes it does long-sleeved has the
little zipper detail at the front which
I really like so I guess you can kind of
like adjust it you know we want a little
a little bit cleavage on show
we can't the materials quite thick
actually and it's like ribbed like
stretching material again let's see from
now doesn't actually look too bad always
always always when it comes to what he
sees I stick to my size because I don't
want anything too tight you know going
around and especially on the bum because
you get that like four cheek situation
and thank you and it was 18 pounds which
again price-wise that's pretty average
I'm more than happy to pay that lets
style the last little piece do you know
what I have like a teeny saw in me that
this body suit was gonna be see-through
but it's actually not this is a good-ass
bodysuit like this is the kind of
bodysuit that I love my little like
bodysuit checklist is a see-through no
does it fit properly and not giving me
full on cheeks yes
is it a thong pretty much yeah if a
bodysuit is all then three things I'm
sold
I've like unzipped it a little bit but
of course you can't like do it all the
way up but you could probably do it all
that okay oh that was definitely too
much for the Internet to be honest with
you this bodysuit is so versatile and it
can be styled in so many different ways
it is totes up to you I look like a cash
Dave time ish appropriate outfit so I've
gotten for these blue jeans which
actually from tesco honestly if it's not
checked up tesco jeans you need to cuz
they are so good the belt is from
Primark my jacket is from a naked
fashion it's just like
long lines heavy bear coat it's so cozy
and then I've just got my shiny back
this is definitely one of the best body
suits I have pretty much like ever owned
do they have this another carnist
because if they do then I might have to
indulge just like maybe everything has
been tried on it's been tested do I
think that misguided is worth spending
your money on well from the pieces that
I've tried to be fair them a jury of the
pieces were really really nice they
feared really well I think they were
laughs the price there was two things in
there though the orange dress and those
white leggings just don't even bother
her but puffing that everything else is
pretty much loved and I do not regret
spending my money on obviously it
depends what you get from every website
everything it's gonna be different but
from the little pile that I got
definitely think it was worth the splash
the only thing I'd say with misskaddy
the only thing that I would recommend
do your research watch your holes read
the reviews because some things are a
little bit like dodge and I feel like
they are a little bit more of the
expensive website but no I really hope

helpful I know a lot of you have a
similar style to me so that's why I do
these holes I know I'm not testing out
the whole website imagine imagine if you
did enjoy you know what to do you know
what to do and if you do maybe want to
see a little bit more of me feel free to
