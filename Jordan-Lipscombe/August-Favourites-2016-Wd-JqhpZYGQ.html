today I have a favorites video for you
which I know you have all been dying to
see there is a bunch of makeup so that's
probably what the majority will be but I
do have a couple of skincare bits and
also I have kind of switched up the
background a bit I saw a couple of my
videos you guys have been asking me um
to kind of maybe have a little bit more
of an interesting background so this is
probably the most interesting bit in my
room
I tried let me know what you guys prefer
to you prefer this background do you
prefer the white background that I have
normally this does me sorting out though
my desk and my makeup seriously needs
sorting out but hmm there's gonna be a
task anyways I'm going to stop rubbing
on otherwise we'll be here forever so if
you guys want to see what I've been at
loving this month just keep watching so
we're going to start with skincare and
this is my first favorite like what the
hell is this so these are the brand new
body shop superfood masks that I have
been obsessed with like these are so
good I mean I like masks but I never
have found one where I actually feel
like it makes a difference to my skin
but these I actually notice so of course
first of all I just want to say um I was
sent these which is why they're in like
a fancy packaging but in no way it does
that influence my opinion on a product
because that's all at the end of the day
if I don't like a product I don't like
it
. you know but of course I've been
loving them which is why they are my
favorites so there is 5 masks in the
collection so you are about to find one
for your skin type and for your skin
needs they are 100% vegetarian and three
of them or even a hundred percent vegan
which is so nice to know and they are
also free for much of crap like parabens
silicon basically the stuff we don't
really need the masks I just run free
them all quickly so if you guys
interested in getting one then you kind
of know what ones you want to get I
guess so the first one is the Amazonian
acai I think that's how you say it masks
so this one is the energizing mask so if
you feel like your skin just needs a bit
of a boost for fritzsche with hear a
little bit more radiance so it's a
little bit dull looking pick up that one
because it's so good at that it smells
amazing as well and it actually looks
like strawberry jam the next one after
that is the utopian honey I
you don't like the smell of this because
I hate the smell of honey and it
literally looks like honey as well this
one is the nourishing one so it leaves
your skin feeling really like nice and
soft and supple and your skin actually
feels more comforted so if you suffer
from dry skin you will probably love
this one because it's really intense for
nourishment the one after that this is
one of my favorites and it's actually
really interesting I've never heard of
anything like this is the Chinese
ginseng and rice mask so this one is the
brightening one so if you suffer from
any kind of dullness discoloration
unevenness things like that this really
helps with that I've had a bit of
redness on my cheeks not sure why and
that this was really calm that down so
then there is a British rose one again
as I like the smell of this because I
don't like rose scented things they kind
of give me a headache because that weird
this one is hydrating one and it leaves
your skin feeling so moisturized looking
really glowy and dewy as well so it just
overall makes your skin look really
healthy then the last one which again is
another favorite because it's the
Himalayan charcoal I love anything
charcoal because I feel like it really
kind of cleanses my skin out thoroughly
this one is the detoxifying one so it
helps remove all the impurities and top
sins and gross stuff that's in your skin
it really just gets rid of it so your
skin is feeling like at its best at its
cleanest it just really gets in there
unclog your skin and you can actually
see when you use this one all the little
black dots where the impurities of
looking pulled out which I love because
I feel like it's actually working then
I'm going to put these down there
because my arm is aching up and I've
just been lovin those it's so refreshing
to see a company bring out a load of
masticator for different skin types and
also that are free from a bunch of stuff
they also do this thing called multi
masking the which I just think this is
such a good idea it's basically where
you can use two or three masks on your
face at once and because I'm sure we all
have different problems in different
areas so that is such a cool idea I
don't know I just feel like my skin has
just been so like this month so I my
next skincare favorite have been these
these are the spotless skin care and
nose poor strips
I don't mind from wilkinson's and I
think that's the only place you can get
them because I think they are sort like
a Wilkinsons for an so if you live in
the UK like I have tried my fair share
of poor strips and I can honestly say
that these have worked the best for me
and the best part about it is you get
six of them and their only account you
can use these on your nose chin forehead
anywhere that you suffer from like that
kids it really just pulls out I'm kind
of gross I find it so satisfying when
you peel off that nose strip and you
look at it and you can see all the
little black heads I've been pulled out
I know that some of you find it
satisfying as well like it's not just me
yeah I got my mummies in these as well
because we was out shopping it as if you
need to pick this up as well mom because
they're so good so I've got how using
them too so if you're looking for some
good poor strips and check out these
ones because they're my favorite so now
we are going to move on to some makeup
favorites the bit I know you've all been
waiting for so this is the first makeup
favor I have this is the benefit curb
Rowell I wanted to share this with you
guys because I'm pretty this is the only
thing I've been using on my brows the
entire month and it is just my favorite
it is like smudge proof budge proof
water proof freaking bullet proof and I
want to see though it does not move off
of my brow so I'm not worried about like
losing a brow halfway through the day it
is just like a cream gel pomade kind of
texture and I'm in the number-three in
case any of you were wondering button
what is cool as well is you can actually
pop off the top and flip back in and you
actually have yourself a little I would
brush as well which i think is so good
so it is definitely worth the money
because you get a pomade and a brush in
one and the packaging though oh I love
it it's super easy to use as well I find
that it is pigmented but like the right
pigmentation so you can build up the
intensity that you like which is awesome
the new benefit bar range is so good I
was so attempted to get the pencil as
well I was like no drawing just get the
cabro let's just walk away from this
benefits down before you buy everything
a bank account hates me enough as is and
I've been loving this so so these have
to be a favorite lip item for me this
month because I've just not put them
down these are the NYX lingerie liquid
lipsticks first of all I have to say the
color range I think was literally made
for me if I was a lipstick color it
would be these I have a 5 out I think
there's 12 I don't know why I don't have
them all but some of my favorites have
been a satin ribbon which I'm actually
wearing today with one my favorite lip
liners which I'll show you in a second
and also
Oh bedtime Fleur which is like a darker
pink version of air so I just watch them
both you this is satin ribbon and this
one is bedtime Fleur oh I just love them
why also I got them as well as the
texture they're kind of more of a mousse
texture as opposed to liquid which I
actually really like because I find this
to be a bit thicker meaning they're a
bit more on pain it can be a teeny bit
drying when I first use them I notice
that they were quite drying but because
I've bought them so much now I'll
actually never even realize anybody also
last a really long time on me as well
which is really good so I know I've been
obsessed with these also they do dry
down mat as well and I'll share one of
my favorite lip liners ever because it
goes with so many colours and I've been
wearing this all the time I'm wearing it
today with that satin ribbon liquid
lipstick but this is the NYX retractable
lip liner in the color I thought I'd do
in the color is the color nude I love
the fact that its retractable as well
because I don't have the sharpen in it
because I hate doing that it's just such
a pain in a bar honestly
actually wear this on its own sometime
but it is more like a movie color oh I
just love it these are so easy to use
really creamy going really smoothly
lasts a really long time don't dry out
my lips this is such a versatile lip
liner it goes with so many of my nudes
it's like the perfect in-between it's
not too light not too tart love it now
if I shouldn't these have been the only
eyeshadows I've been reaching for this
whole pretty much because they are
freaking amazing a lot of people love
them these are the makeup geek ones I
don't know I'm so late on a bandwagon
with these but honestly I think a these
honestly the most pigmented most easy to
work with i shadow x' i have ever used
uncorrupt here which is the black eye
shadow oh my god
I am never known a black eye shadow to
be this pigmented in my entire life look
I will barely even touch it
sorry well that's just a few of the
other I should have switched as well
honestly they're so creamy and buttery I
know everyone uses them descriptions for
eyeshadows but it's true I also have
these ones as well at first of all how
cute is this it was e palette it's
actually from makeup geek it's just like
mirrored and then there's actually a
mirror in
as well I love it these are some of the
foiled eyeshadows as well which by the
way are just as pigmented but like the
super metallic so my go-to eyeshadows
for this month have definitely been
makeup deep for sure and I'm sure
they're going to be my go-to for months
to come and I'm definitely ordering some
more of these so this month I have
really been getting into kind of
correcting nothing crazy um but I've
been using these la girl pro conceal
concealers so I have the sort of
original concealer a contour shade and
two of their color correctors as well I
think Severinus my two favorites will
have to be the concealer and the orange
corrector or to be honest I've never
really been big on color correcting and
never thought I really made that much of
a difference I've been using this orange
concealer underneath my eyes and
honestly it helps with the darkness so
much I never see any dark color under
there anymore at all this is so
pigmented so you literally only need
these smallest amounts that will last
you so long honestly this is the one
I've been reaching for the most I do
also really like the Urban Decay Naked
skin color corrector this is in the
peach one again it's literally just as
pigmented is more very liquidy formula
that over-the-top I've been using the
same concealer but in the porcelain
shade these are like a little match made
in heaven you guys they're both really
pigmented both really easy to blend the
concealer has really good coverage it's
quite thick but it has really good
coverage doesn't look take your heavy
underneath my eyes I have just been
loving them I got mine from eBay I think
for like three pounds each so so freakin
affordable so I have another little
favorite here again it is very
affordable this is the Primark PS liquid
eyeliner in black this is one pound now
I'll be honest I didn't have much hope
when I picked this up I kind of feel
like Primark I look I'm judgement or
anything but you just don't expect a
pound either to be your favorite but
this is probably my favorite liquid
eyeliner that I have ever used it's
honestly really pigmented it's super
black the little brush inside makes it
super easy to apply it as well it
doesn't smudge doesn't flake off doesn't
fade on me it literally last the entire
day
I honestly I thought my favorite liquid
I don't know I think and I already have
a spare in my drawer because you girls
prepped look how black that is the
primal eyeliner was talking about look
it's dried and it does not budge of
course this has to be in my favorites
because this is the anastasia beverly
hills glow kit in some deputies are
honestly incredible they are so
pigmented and have the most amazing kind
of Sheen to them so they don't look
powdery or anything on the skin and I
love the fact that you get four
different highlighters as well to cater
for like different skin tones and I can
actually use every single one of these I
actually use this bronze one here to
blend in my like highlight shade and my
blush last bronzer together and it just
creates the motorcycle for look glow to
your skin it is definitely worth
purchasing you get four huge pans and
every single one is just as amazing as
each other so I just wanted to include
this in I know we've all heard about it
but so now I want to show you guys some
of my favorite beauty tools this month
so the first one I have is this little
blue sponge which I'm not going to hold
up for too long because it's gross if I
use it like everyday so but I do wash
them before anybody does I actually have
some more of these in that little jar
there because again I am prepped with
the backups I use this in my back to
school video and a lot of you were
asking where this is from and it's from
Primark I feel like I've found another
little underdog product from prior
garlic oh it's so soft so it doesn't
feel like I'm beating my face when I run
this underneath the tap it does expand
which is amazing because it means I
won't absorb all of your foundation and
it just blends everything out really
quickly because it's quite big as well
and really nicely and I find I get such
a nice finish with this sponge I have
never used a real Beauty Blender but
quite honestly I don't think I ever will
because this sponge does exactly what I
want it to so what's the point of
forking out for a sponge when you can
get one like this which in my opinion is
probably just as good
I found the sponges one that I've been
using everyday since for my foundation
this is my kind of last little beauty
tool this is the Sigma e30 8 this is the
diffused crease brush this is such an
amazing like a blending brush
I love the shape of it it's kind of like
thinner than normal so you can really
get into the crease because I have quite
small eyes so this get since the
creasing doesn't like put it all over my
lid or anything like that
also the bristles pick up the perfect
amount of product and it just blends out
so well so they are all my favorites for
this month I apologize if it was a
little bit long also in the comments but
I want you guys to say what your
favorite products have been this month
or even some of your Holy Grail makeup
items because then we can all kind of
scroll through and see what things that
we need knife so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video if you have don't
forget to smash that thumbs up button
and subscribe while you're here I love
you guys and I'll see you in my next one
