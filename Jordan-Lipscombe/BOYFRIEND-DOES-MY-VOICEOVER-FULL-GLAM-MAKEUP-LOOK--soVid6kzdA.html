you with this naughty makeup look I mean
a little bit too good are you ready
because I am so you've got a dark lip um
oh that's my tongue and that's also my
hair so let's go right so my cheeks are
looking good and there my cheeks again
let's do this so I'm gonna start primer
did it minimize those pause boom right
make sure there's good coverage around
the forehead etc here we go now for the
concealer I think it's conceal that's
gone right so let's put your hair back
make sure you cover all those pimples
and all that bad stuff right and now for
the urban decay foundation but a little
bit only a little bit right let's do
this I'm gonna whack this on my cheeks
get that good coverage we got to make
sure that we get all around the jawline
the bottom half look at that bottom lip
guy right little more dab make sure
there's no patchy bits around your face
and your forehead and your t-zone etc
but also you're mentioning that you've
got to your neck so I mean oh yeah make
sure you do the neck yeah right and now
we're onto our eyeball makeup which is
concealer
eisah concealer before but this is can
see a poor looks like I need to why so
put that like a rainbow s-type like the
nouveau found your eyes and then once
you've done that put it on your little
on your top lip on the bottom lip up
your nose on your forehead why not you
know you still got it and then you've
got a gap in blender and blend that in
blend that in good dab it out just dab
it out dab it sound good Dada Dada Dada
Dada oh okay and those creases dab it
dab it dab dab dab dab this isn't even
Spain art this is just my rapid hand
movements so have it out whoa now for
the RCM a powder it's the original so
you know it's the best just gonna do the
same thing as I did with the other
concealer and yeah same movements and
get some structure on your face I think
exactly and we got blend it out make
sure that contour is on fleek you know
then just a bit of a blend hide from now
blend it in blend it in make sure you
know no powder is still clung to give
out conk out by that eardrum eardrum now
on that make up forever hi can't swish
that around make sure there's no excess
anyway go right up into that right a bit
cold anyway under the jaw around the
cheeks make sure you look Rosie and
bronzy I think it's bronzer out the nose
up why not a little sniff now to make
these cheekbones look pointy AF get that
consort on you know about this Jordan
right so yep just more blending make
sure you've got some whole lips go go go
oh and now for the other side make sure
it looks even and lovely don't want one
cheekbone bigger than the other and now
I have no idea I mean that looks good
get rid of it new it's a new batch it's
fine oh it's blush making those cheeks
that rosy yeah and the other side make
sure it's even yes again that's a little
smile why not
yeah and now for my favorite a
highlighter the illuminator here we go
don't too much as you know you want too
much especially for Jordan you need too
much so cause that car headlights in the
distance or is it my cheeks anyway so
dab up Beauty Blender make that
highlight look good on a night out you
don't need disco lights just look at the
cheeks maybe they'll shine so here we go
on the old front the nikkietutorials
glow goals there's going to be a bit of
a earth first impressions
oh look at that Nikki you've got this a
lot down girl you know about it that
added with the iconic night look more
glow around the cheeks bring it out to
where your temple is on your forehead
you want a glowy forehead I mean if
that's you then sweet and blend that out
make sure it's all even and looking good
you don't want it patchy and onto the
eyes got a little tub here gonna
little dab dab over the eyes make sure
you get that crease good and whatever
this is right it's whack on some
chickadee oh that's a bit dodging it
bring that back up and
blend blend blend it's like grease I
think it's a crease anyway face going on
even more blending even more blending
Jesus my wrist is aching man and now for
the other eye
make it quick because my wrist is on
fire oh and good dropped it now for some
cocoa bear why not I mean you put three
others on my eyes so I made on even more
blending the same wrist I mean there's
not really much I can say apart from
look at that crease though very nice -
now I'm gonna put both of them on my
eyelids even more I mean we're on like
five now so we're on five different
colors on the same eyes I mean it could
just keep going I mean we've got to
eight or nine maybe even ten different
colors on the one eyelid I mean it's
phenomenal
so I'm now gonna switch to a different
brush that does the same thing as the
last brush so logic there and for the
troublemaker the urban decay apparently
this stuff is sex proof I hear but
that's just the rumor I mean this is
good selling point I guess I think
anyway oh that's weird
that was weird I mean that's completely
normal
anyway let's get the old glue I mean
could use mother hand why not have a
little boy a little boy and stick him on
babe
stick alum and now on to the left and
boot and it's already didn't you have to
show you you know the drill
I am 2 p.m. let's go put on the bottom
half I mean in the eye I'm good so plan
is and avoid getting poked in the eye so
we go good right done and now have a
little bit of a shuffle underneath a
little technical and and same again on
the other side of my face same procedure
blend that round give that smoky eye
round looks good and now on to the lippy
yes here we go cool that is a dark
bitter lip Oh
make sure that's round don't get any on
your foundation because that's just
mares and it's just horrible when it
your teeth as well gonna top one stick
that top lip out gum and you've almost
there you almost are we good that is the
final look guys I hope you enjoyed it
the hair looks good they don't even with
me but that's cool bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
