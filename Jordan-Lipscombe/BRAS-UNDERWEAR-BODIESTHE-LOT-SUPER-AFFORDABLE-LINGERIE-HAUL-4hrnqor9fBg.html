hey everyone its Jordan today's video is
actually a little bit different I've
never filmed this kind of video on my
channel before but I have wanted to do
it for the longest time I just wanted to
make sure that I had you know everything
together this video is gonna be a
lingerie haul but not just any old no
lingerie let me tell you you can pay
like coin for lingerie it's kind of a
little bit crazy and like keeping it
real here money doesn't grow on trees
you know like so I wanted to make this a
super affordable you know get lingerie
from like accessible places that doesn't
cost a frickin fortune basically this is
like fab under way
you know like that kind of underwear but
with a low price tag and I'm here for it
the reason why I really really wanted to
do this video is I think it's so
important for both being a woman and to
be fair guys as well it's so important
to feel good in your own skin and as
soon as it sounds
lingerie can do that it can make you
feel good I think it's important to feel
what's sexy you know what I mean whether
you've got a man at home or not
you know you should wear it for yourself
you know feel good for you put something
on for you to make you feel good I think
it's like super important I love buying
lingerie as well there's just something
about it I don't know what it is I just
love a new like fresh power like
underwear and just all really really
quickly I do just want to say as well I
know when I do cause acylation no more
clothing hauls I always do trials I
always say I do trials I think it's so
much better you know to see things on
however this is of course lingerie so
you know some pieces of it lacy bit like
bit of C freeness going on and I'm
pretty sure you should is not the place
to you know just like work out an it so
I'm not gonna be trying them on and
really are you sorry but you kind of get
the gist anyway you know it covers this
covers this coverage of it's why we'll
do those I'll put in pictures of like
the underwear like laid out and star so
you can see it better than just me like
holding up so majora if this stuff is
Primark I've thrown in a little bit we
started and pretty little thing as well
so you know you know it's not gonna
break the bank anyway huh that was like
a Long Island Road she's jump straight
into it this lingerie haul that is not
gonna pull out a freaking hole in your
bank account I don't even know what
where to start you know what let's start
with Primark I feel like you
we'll probably be most intrigued for
Primark I do just want to say at Primark
honestly 90% of my underwear is Primark
like I've got a little bit of fun
summers you know a little bit of there's
a little bit of that you know them all
kind of bougie places so like keeping it
real I can buy like one set from there
and like four from Primark and adds up
to the same price so I mean if you've
not gone into Primark and have like a
wander around their underwear section
you so need to they do some really good
quality pieces I'm just really like good
looking stuff I'm gonna stop I'm like
okay Primark like you know I just love
it love it love it love it okay right
these are sorry thank you I'm gonna
start with like the more Borrelia type
funds wearing then we get more until you
know the more like but before we begin I
just want to clarify on my boob size and
my normal sizing just in case you want
to compare yours to mine so you kind of
know what sizing to get I don't know
will it be helpful I think so
so boob wise I don't know about you but
being a woman my boobs change size all
the time sometimes there are see
sometimes there are be I just don't even
know they liked it there I need to
switch it up at the moment I'm currently
a be you know poor things are shrunk I
love home like grabbing my boobs like I
have a lot of like side boob but I don't
have a lot of like middle bit you know
what I'm embracing the anybody cities
it's called underwear wise like the
bottom half of me I'm a size 8 but
sometimes in Primark I'm normally like a
medium which is like a 10 to 12 because
of my hips but sometimes I'm as small as
well it depends but I'll tell you what I
got in the sizes of the stuff that I got
if that makes sense so here is the first
piece I'm having to hold it like really
weird leaks otherwise if I'm like this
like you literally you can't even say
yeah see how cute is this brawler
it feels such good quality as well when
I saw this I was like I just had to have
it do you know what I mean like look at
that that is so pretty so the cups
himself are like a triangle shape
they're mesh as well so you know a
little bit of cheeky little something
going on there but then they have this
amazing like floor applique a stuff over
the top of the I think looks so nice and
then they have this thick band around
the bottom in is actually velvet and the
back just does up like a normal bra
would and of course you can adjust the
straps to like of course you can't go
wrong with the black I just think it
looks good on everybody and then the
bottoms they of course do match I don't
know what it is
I'm just one of these girls that can't
wear underwear that doesn't matter just
got a match I don't know why too kind of
like underwear underwear like designs
cuz she decide I'm gonna go designs that
I go for is a thongs and brazilian
Brazilian someone that kind of like
covers half of your bum cheek so these
ones that go with that bra are more of a
Brazilian style as you can see the same
kind of design and then the back the
little booty area is or mesh as well
when I first saw these I thought that's
a lot of coverage on the bum and I'm not
like the biggest fan of that but as soon
as this is on your bum let me so you
know we've got we've got that half
coverage going on even below half
coverage to be honest I put a picture
here of it so you can see it like as a
set together this is hella cute like
this is so cute you do buy them
separately they don't come as a set
which I personally really really like
because let's be real I'm not the same
size on top as I am on the bottom and I
feel like a lot of girls aren't and
that's so normal and then I know it's
the more kind of like variety it's hyper
ours like stuff like this morning you
know like a cup they come in small
medium large so this is in a small the
little bra was eight pounds and the
bottoms were three pounds so what all
together eleven pounds for an underwear
set like like you actually can't go
wrong 11 pounds like it's so good so
fucking good apparently I got these ones
in a small but it's because they look
look they look white do you not I mean
but typically I do get a medium I just
always look at them and kind of like a
judge but yeah these are actually in the
small I love this set so much that's one
second I got it in this amazing like
dark plummy purpley color as well roll
it's exactly the same underwear as you
can see is exactly the same to same
price everything I think these are just
so frickin a flowering even though they
don't have any support you know there's
no padding in there or any lift or
anything like that but warehouses design
on it it's like it's kind of sexy it
just I love it obviously I know if
you've got like big boobs this is a
probably gonna be like the best thing
for you because it doesn't have you know
a crap ton of support but for my girls
out there who don't really need a lot
well you know these are perfect so
pretty kind of sexy it's just like
everything everything you'd want this
doesn't look like and it doesn't feel
like it costs 11 pounds that's for sure
moving away from the bra let's now you
know morons you like your bras I have
this little gem here yep it's still from
Primark is it just me or does is it like
something you could find in an summer's
furillo it's black and nude nude it's
just got this amazing detail like all
over it is so like intricate and that's
why I think it looks so much more
expensive how's this amazing light lace
up get on the boobies you know adds a
little something slumming it straps up
at the back like a normal bra again
adjustable and inside the cups you know
hopefully about to see I don't know but
there is a little bit of pudding
nothing crazy it's just a little little
extra little boost so you know it's not
gonna make your boobs look like okay
it's just gonna give you a little push a
little bit of help which I'm not
complaining about as you can see from
the label here I got it in a and B say
TV and then my okay
am i right these are the matching of
bottoms as you can see more of a thong
type situation but how cute are these
they see you know you've still got the
same sort of design on the front but how
cool is this so you have like two straps
is really hard for me to show you
because you have this little line here
and you get another like strap what's
really really nice about this is you can
have you know the normal bit of the
underwear sitting where it normally
words and then there's strap bits on top
you can kind of like pull up and pull up
on your hips if that makes sense it
looks so good I mean like it looks so
good not like on my body I just mean
it's that sort of style that's been
going around like ever at the moment I
think it's really really flattering when
you can have bring things up like over
your hips you know something like really
high rise on the legs
oh my elbow the underwear is in a medium
like I said and they were only three
pounds so again this is 11 pounds same
surprise for them bralets as well the
quality for the price is like beyond
amazing
on a sea Priok man like they're one of
my favorite places like I don't care
what anybody says like that's cute right
look at that
I'm living for a new thing oh I think
it's time to add a little bit of color
into the mix that being pink this is
just so pretty like he came
I love the Ahly pink and new this time
which i think is like a great combo I
love the little like carl bit in the
middle here by the cup so i also loved a
little bit of lace hanging down and then
at the back look how cool this is so
like cross chrissie cross creek want
chris christie bits at the back as you
can see it's like way chunkier than a
normal kind of bra it has one two three
four five hours five little Clippy
things that is a lot of course
adjustable straps and the cups just so
you know they don't have anything in it
is just you know it's just your boob
just gotta rely on your own little
boobies underwear it's kind of semester
last pair actually we've got a lot more
like strap inch go into strap hitch
what's this like fifty shades this is
what i mean up by strapping so as you
can maybe kind of not actually see
there's free straps so you got an extra
one at the top here you've got the
normal underwear strap and then you have
one underneath that I think that's hella
hot it is a thong but this time it's
more like logical that like and cheese
string kind of thong which gonna be
honest is not normally my favorite this
is just too cute to pass up what are you
in a medium again and this one you go
three pound again I didn't say what the
top was good job John it is 10 which i
think is a really really good price this
is like a bra bra let kind of situation
I swear you could walk into more of your
you know high-end lingerie places and
pay what forty fifty quid for this like
easy easy peasy lemon squeezy
and then Primax over here doing it for
13 pounds a Pilate in law fair a little
tea love it I think this may be the last
Primark peace guys
well no technically I could show you
like way more because I have so much
underwear but this is like current
pieces I in that if you went into a
Primark now you'd get your hands on sort
of thing we got something black again I
do love myself a little bit of black I
think it's so like forgiving so here it
is it looks kind of plain right you'd
look at me a bit I was kind of plain
Jane not that there's anything wrong
with that of course but it's the
material unfit that makes this bra it's
velvet and anything you velvet makes
something look super super expensive
it's got this cool like cross detail
here in the middle again has more like a
thicker band thing here so it looks kind
of bra leti at the same
I'm oh where you going come back the
back you can see is thick other straps
are thicker it's all it's all just a bit
more thicker but for all my ladies out
there who love their boobs to look like
you know to look like boobs this is the
bra for you because holy crap is this
thing gonna push your boobs up if you
like that cleavage if you like that
boobie boob this is for you product do
this range called and maximize this is
what this is from basically it is pretty
put it I meant to say padded put it
let's put it to the max yeah it's got so
much padding in here so your boobs of
course gonna sit on that padding it's
gonna set a lot higher a lot closer you
know your boobs are just gonna look boys
would say we're lying girls will say no
we're just making you know the best out
of a small situation literally this was
ten pounds and then the bonds that well
as both of the bottoms it comes with
these don't actually come with the bra
the bra well from what I saw didn't have
a matching a set however I saw these and
I was like you totally could go away
with this like it looks like it matches
these little guys so they are a thong
and then the front has this like lacy
velvety oligo you can see him although
velvety design and because it's velvet
of course matches with the top so it
looks like hopefully it's a and these
were only three pounds and I've got them
in a medium to I mean as you can tell
like Primark prices are pretty
consistent no matter what you get on
average you're gonna pay like three
pounds of bottoms and then four top like
the little bra bit you're gonna pay more
like ten pounds something like that
Primark out of this haul is definitely
the most affordable so if you really are
on a budget but you still want that kind
of underwear that still has the same
vibe as these more higher-end places
check them out
I'm sure at the quality to the price I
know I've said it about a thousand times
I feel like but it's so true if next
place I'm gonna share with you which I
share with you misguided would you miss
got it I only have two bits from them
but for all my ladies out there who like
that underwear you know a little bit
more like we're talking like leveling up
a little bit like a little bit sexier
you know body
we're talking more like course--a
situations let me show you so this top
kamesha florally kind of design on the
cups it has these sort of string bits
going around your cube color at the
bralette that i'm wearing right now is
strappy it's gapi and then at the bottom
look a little something like this of
course same vibe as the top so you have
these like cut out bits here on the legs
it's a thong at the back too it's super
super stretchy around the waistband
by the way considering this is quite
like a sexy piece it's so comfortable
these two are sold separately and
because it's obviously more of a
bralette kind of situation it's sold in
like size 6 8 10 12 etc I got them both
in a size 8 you can kind of use me as a
guide I guess for sizing wise so size 8
is perfect for like be /c cups and then
so on now I'm not gonna like that I know
this is an affordable lingerie haul and
this is a little bit more expensive not
as expensive as more higher-end but it's
still a little bit more pricier however
misguided have sales on all the freaking
time
so wait till you get like a code or
there's a sale on or something to get
them and it really won't be that pricey
that's what I did rob was 22 pounds and
the bottoms were 10 so what that's like
32 pounds for us out I know a little bit
pricier it's so worth it though I'm not
gonna the height that is worth it it's
one of those pieces that like you buy
like one of and you have this and you're
like okay I feel good now this set in
particular comes with this and this is I
can just call it a waspey it's basically
like a corset thing it goes round the
middle so you know if you want to be a
little bit extra all you know it's for
your man or something but does this look
good on it is so flattering it's really
really good quality so these lines here
they have like wire and stuff so they
you know contain its shape and then it
wraps around the back and there's little
hooks at the back here where you can
wind in and out like this kinda like a
shoelace I guess so you can kind of make
it look like a course and you can really
like suck everything in kind of makes
you this sore shape you know like it
really brings you in at the waist and
makes your hips look like this this by
itself is 18 pounds so you know so
you don't have to have it is totally
optional it doesn't come as a whole set
which is really really good so you know
you don't have to pay the extra money
for it if you don't want to days I did
though I don't regret it it's nice to
have something like this in my
collection yeah wait for the sale so you
can save them coins this next thing is
I've a body which means it kind of looks
like a bodysuit it's like a lingerie
bodysuit this is like bedroom only this
one here has to be my favorite body that
I have like ever worn in my life and
don't worry I know buddies aren't gonna
be for everybody that's so fine but this
one is so nice I just have to share it
with you look it is can you guys see it
sparkling it's so sparkly as you can see
this is a full mesh body like this is
mesh in every place it possibly could be
mesh and it's covered in these little
shiny little flat things good
description there John okay my camera
just went it's like Tommy apparently
Ernie currently but no I just love this
I think is so pretty and my favorite
thing about this you get this ribbon
like round your waist and you can like
its high as tight as you want and really
suck everything in and like bring you
that shape you can adjust the straps and
everything it's just so flattering on
it's so like figure flattering
it's amazing why I also love about it
which i think is really flaring as well
it's super high rise like it comes up to
like they'll really read like basically
your hips on the legs it comes up to
your hips
now bodies things like that usually I
keep before I send someone but if the
body is like appropriate enough I love
to our bodies as actual body suits like
on a night out and stuff with jeans and
stuff I think they look so nice this one
I mean this is mesh AF as you can see
like you can see everything so anything
I could redo that with this unless I
wore something underneath but I don't
really know what you'd works it's super
low cart and stuff this was let me have
like a cheeky garnish this was at 25
pounds which I really don't think is a
bad price at all don't get me wrong it's
a little bit more expensive but I think
it's definitely reasonable there's a
really strong mesh as well you know that
sounds silly but you know some missha's
like you go to put them on and then your
finger falls for it in your life
well that that's right I just have to
share this with you because it's one of
my favorite lingerie pieces that I own
and I got it recently the last two
pieces that I'm going to show you are
from pretty doll today we're going back
to more of these sort of Primark kind of
prices it's a teeny teeny teeny bit more
expensive but nothing correct I love
this piece I think it is so cute first
of all I love this color that like very
burgundy red kind of like a vibe I love
it so it's just kind of like mesh as you
can see little triangle shapes it's V
boobies as you can see the back kind of
just clasp up here what I love is this
little frilly bit at the bottom it kind
of like frills out and it looks really
really cute there's a definitely multi
like hue underwear set for sure and then
the bottoms look like this yeah the
shape of this if a thong and Brazilian
had a baby this is what it would be it
kind of has like a V front in the back
is kind of like it's like a thong and
Brazilian see what I mean can you kind
of see that it's more of a thong don't
get me wrong there aren't it and then
has all like the frilly nurse around it
that kind of like comes out to like the
top kind of comes out in the bottom kind
of comes out it's so cute and fits
really really well I know the crotch
looks like super long but they are kind
of high-waisted as well so you can know
at just where you want them to fit on
your body shape the only bad thing about
this it comes at the set so you can
choose your sizes differently which I
know I said earlier that's the best
thing because everyone's you know I'm
not the same size top and bottom so you
can't do that with this which is a tad
bit annoying but if you are someone who
is like a similar size like me like top
and bottom then like this will work for
you but if not I'm really sorry I got it
in a and price-wise it is 15 pounds
which is super super affordable I'm
pretty sure it comes in other colors as
well like black and green I think I
think we on that what do you think
they're very very last I have to show
you is this little guy this one is
definitely more like a thinner like
delicate kind of piece but I really
loved about this is the huge like bow in
the middle now I know this isn't gonna
be for like everybody's taste but I just
think of something like different just
to like pre-war new eyes
can't really wear this on tight clothing
because the bow kind of just like
bunches up and looks kind of like you've
just got like something there I wear it
under like more loose baggy are like
clothing so you can't kind of see I
don't know if you can see that but it's
really really mesh this one like really
really meshes super like thin
everything's pretty thin like there's
trouble the back stain you get the
picture you have the picture I mean you
get the idea my brain did not work and
then this is the underwear
what is it kind of like a bird like
they're pretty basic these ones there
just move like that Brazilian pant style
have the same pattern on like the back
and the front it's kind of more like
basic kind of like there's not a lot to
it but where it's like mesh everywhere
it looks good on really really annoying
it comes as a say again you can't choose
separate sizes that the only thing about
parental thing the more affordable stuff
comes in sets and you can't choose it's
the only thing like I didn't it was 80
pounds I got in a size a and it comes in
red as well I did really want the red
but they sold out when I got it so they
are all the pieces that I have for to
share with you I know there wasn't like
a ton like a crap-ton but I wanted to
just show you what I have been like my
faves you know I was gonna say I don't
actually have that much underwear but I
feel like I'd be like kidding myself I
kind of like clean out my underwear
quite regularly because I like to you
know switch it up and kind of get fresh
things in and stuff like that they're
just a couple of my favorite places to
shop for underwear like I would never
think to really go misguided and pretty
little thing and boohoo Oh boohoo
by the way there's some really nice
underwear pieces as well I haven't
purchased any but I was on there last
night they do so nice a bit I was going
this with the clothes never the lingerie
section but maybe check them out you
might find something that you love
funnily enough though between all of
them places
Primark I think to the most affordable
and like better underwear because you
can buy them separately it's just a
little bit more convenient that quality
is far for the price I think Primark I
would probably recommend the most to
look out for sure but if you are more of
like an online shopper then the choice
is there too well so I want to say oh
yeah these underwear pieces aren't gonna
work for every single boob size I know
there's girls that they're that need
more support all those gals like me who
are a little bit smaller and don't need
so much I know I love this underwear was
for my size boobs but you know I'm just
working with what I've got I wish I
could
all my ladies because we're all
different sizes I totally get that and I
probably would do that in at the future
I don't want to leave anybody out but I
just want to share with you you know I'm
just kind of working with my car like
literally what I've got and of course
all these places do all different boob
sizes so just like kind of like have a
little total browse anyway I hope you
