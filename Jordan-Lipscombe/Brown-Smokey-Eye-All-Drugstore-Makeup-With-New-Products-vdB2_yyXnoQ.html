so today I've created this kind of
chocolatey brown smokey eye feel and
I've had it with a nude lip but I think
this would look amazing with any lip
color I think of RAM lip would look
amazing people would choose a nude lip
but it's just most wearable I guess yeah
I created this look using all drugstore
makeup products now recently I picked up
a few new things from the drugstore I've
been out and instead of doing a haul
video I thought I would just incorporate
it in this tutorial so kind of doing two
things at once I guess I wasn't too sure
I was doing this is the look that I come
up with so if you want to see how I
created this look then just keep
watching okay so I'm going to start by
priming my skin I'm using the collection
of primes and ready prime and this one
is the mattifying pore minimizer one and
I'm just going to focus this in the
center of my face kind of where all my
pores are and just press that into my
skin
and therefore foundation I'm going to
take these two new products one is the
Maybelline Dream velvet foundation and
the other is the L'Oreal infallible
sculpt contouring base and I'm just
going to mix these two together on the
back of my hand feels a little bit
strange at first because one's very
moosie and the other ones very liquidy
but I promise keep mixing it does work
and I'm just dotting that all over my
skin and I'm going to blend that in
using a flat top brush just sort of
patting and buffing I'm mixing these two
together because the Maybelline one has
a very nice coverage and the L'Oreal
contouring base where you can use this
either two ways the first way is you can
use as your step one so your actual
foundation or you can do what I have and
mix it in and is basically designed to
create a very nice base for your cream
contour products to stick to so it's
meant to make it last longer look very
natural and not cakey and it's just
basically designed to make your contour
look as good as it can now I'm just
going to quickly do my brows I'm using
the Maybelline master brow Pro palette
lines in deep brown again I believe this
is a new product and I'm just going to
brush with my brows and sort of do small
hair like strokes I'm using the wax in
this product at this point and I'm just
focusing most of the product towards the
end of my brow and then bring it in less
product as I get towards the front
and then I'm going to go in with the
brow powder and just set that one in
place and also fill in any areas that I
may have missed and then I just repeat
the same thing on the other brow the
other brow isn't it were harder to do I
don't know if you guys have ever noticed
but I do actually have a scar for this
eyebrow so I have to work with it a
little bit more now back to the skin I'm
going to take the collection lasting
perfection concealer and this is in fair
we all know and love this concealer is
really good and I'm just putting this in
upside down triangles underneath my eyes
just to sort of highlight and conceal
then I'm also going to take that on my
Cupid's bow my chin down the center of
my nose I'm going to look at my forehead
just to sort of even out the highlight
so I think looks too crazy and then I'm
just going to Pat that in using my Real
Techniques sponge this is my favorite
way to blending concealer because I just
think it makes it look so natural and
it's so easy to do is so quick
and then I'm going to take my brush that
I used to blend in my foundation and I'm
just going to blend in the edges of that
concealer just to make everything look
as seamless as it possibly can
now this is the next new product from
L'Oreal this is the infallible sculpt
contouring palette and mine's in 0 1 and
this one was the more kind of cool toned
one and just taking the darker shade and
I'm just going to place the product
everywhere where I want the definition
so for me that's going to be my
cheekbones my temples got to bring onto
my forehead and I'm also going to take
that along my jawline this is such a
nice product it's so easy to use if
you're a beginner and you're thinking
about cream contouring I definitely
would recommend this product because
it's so easy to apply and you'll see in
a second when I blend out it is so easy
like it's so quick and then I'm going to
take the lighter shade and I'm going to
start by placing that underneath my eyes
was kind of in between my contour and my
under eye I don't want to apply it
underneath my eyes because I've already
concealed I don't need to do that but
I'm just using this to brighten certain
areas so I'm also taking that on my nose
Cupid's bow chin and little teeny bit on
my forehead and then I'm going to blend
that out using my Beauty Blender
starting with the lighter areas and then
moving on to the dark this way nothing
mixes too much and you keep the
brightness where you want it and the
definition where you want it and
hopefully you guys can see just how easy
this is to blend out like I just have to
Pat it a few times and it's pretty much
blended it's so quick and easy to use
and it's very natural-looking product as
well which is really really nice because
it doesn't look too crazy now to set
everything in place I'm going to take
the collection shear loose powder in
translucent and I'm just going to make
sure that have no creasing under my eyes
and then I'm going to actually bake with
this so I'm going to place this
underneath my eyes just pack that on and
then I'm also going to take it
underneath my contour just to sharpen
that line further you could totally skip
this step but I just thought I may as
well do it and then I'm going to take a
big fluffy brush and just gently set the
rest of my face with a little bit of
powder and then while that's baking I
just primed my lids using that same
collection concealer and then after
about five minutes I brushed the powder
off
and then just to define the contour even
more I'm taking the sleek contour kit in
medium and I'm just going to buff that
into the skin you don't actually have to
use this to set anything because the
l'oreal contour palette is a cream to
powder finish so you don't actually need
to but I just did and then for blush I'm
taking this really neutral color and
this is lolly by MUA
and I'm just starting up by the
cheekbones and bringing it onto the
apples focusing more of the product
though on my cheekbones because I have a
quiet around face so I'm just kind of
keeping it further back now for
highlighter this is so nice I don't know
what happened to my mind's gonna wait
but it still works fine this is the
autograph highlighter and you can find
this in Marks and Spencers and it's just
such a pretty kind of rose gold
highlighter and it's just got this most
kind of pretty soft wet look to it it
just doesn't have any sort of shimmer or
anything like that it's just a really
pretty highlighter
and now on to eyes I'm going to take
this makeup revolution salted-caramel
palettes and I'm going to take that kind
of matte white shade and I'm just going
to apply this all over the lids just so
all the other shadows blend so much
easier and then I'm going to go in with
this sort of warm orange shade and this
is going to be my transition color so
I'm just taking that on a fluffy
blending brush any one will do and just
start working that back and forth in the
crease and also just off bringing it up
above the crease this doesn't have to be
too neat it's just our transition shade
now I just want something a little bit
more warmer so I'm taking it elf matte
eyeshadow no idea on the color of it
because I've had it for so long but it's
just a kind of brick red shade and I'm
just applying that into the crease as
well bringing it slightly on the lids
but mainly focusing it in the crease not
bringing up as high as I did that
transition shade and then taking a clean
blending brush blending everything
together and now going in with this
sleek blush by three palette in lace and
I just want a very kind of red eye
shadow because I didn't feel like it was
warm enough and so I'm just taking this
red eye shadow and just Mortman and I
show it's a blush but I'm just using it
as an eye shadow and just blending it
back and forth in the crease
and now I go back into the salted
caramel palette and I'm going to take
this or chocolatey brown shade and I'm
just packing this onto the lid I'm
trying to make this as intense as I can
so I'm kind of going back and forth in
between picking up products and applying
it onto the lids then using that same
blending brush that I use to apply that
kind of red shade and I'm just going to
blend the two colors together so the lid
shade in the crease shade I'm just going
to blend them together blending in this
look is so important because it just
makes everything look as good as it can
and now as I was blending I felt I took
a little bit of the product away so I'm
going in with this very dark brown
almost black shade and I'm just going to
Pat that on the lid as well and I'm
going to use that same blending brush
just to blend everything together and I
just keep going back and forth in
between applying product and blending
just to get as intense as I like it and
now moving on to mascara I'm taking this
full / sculpt mascara this is new by
L'Oreal and just applying a thin coat of
this you can literally just do mascara
and leave at that it looks just as good
but I'm going to apply false eyelashes
because I love myself some false
eyelashes so that is what I'm going to
do this mascara as you can see though is
really good it really lengthens my
lashes and I'm taking these eyelashes by
invoke and these are in 0-1 the glamour
rise ones and I'm just placing these on
my eye there so easier to apply because
they have a very thin lash band so I
found them super easy to apply now the
lashes are applied I'm just going to
move on to my under eye so I'm taking
that same warm orange shade from the
palette and just start placing that
back-and-forth underneath the eye and
then I'm going to go in with the to dark
brown shades that are used in the
palette that I used all over my lid and
I'm just going to focus this closer to
the lower lash line so not bring it down
as far and just keep going back and
forth until I got as intense as I like
it
now a small coat of mascara and I am
moving on to the lips I think yes so I'm
taking this lip liner by MUA in caramel
nugget and I'm just sort of lining my
lips and filling them in a little bit
and then after I done this I just
decided that it wasn't as light as I
actually wanted it I want it to be a
little bit more new so I took this
colour-pop lippie stick in skimpy and I
just applied this all over then
tips and after that's done the look is
complete okay so this is the completed
look I hope that you guys have enjoyed
