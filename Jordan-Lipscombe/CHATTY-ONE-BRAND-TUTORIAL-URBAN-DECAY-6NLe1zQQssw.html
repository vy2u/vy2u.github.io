all really really well and I have been a
sad week so far so today's video is
actually an exciting one I went to some
one of these videos on my channel now
for the longest time and there will
definitely be more coming from other
brands so stay tuned for that so this is
a Wonder Bra tutorial using everything
other than 2k now I really want to scoop
out indigo because I have a few things
from them already that I'm to really
really enjoy so I just wanted to a
double more into the brand and give you
guys my honest thoughts of the products
almost identically the high-end brand so
we want to know whether it's worth
spending our money on right now because
I am totally honest with you guys and
decay it did really really kindly send
me out a few products for this video so
every day thank you so much for doing
that honestly you didn't have to but I
really appreciate it but in no way will
that influence my opinion because at the
end of the day like if I don't like
something I don't like it you know I
keep it real over here so I did create
the look that I'm wearing right now it's
just something a little bit different
I've not done this or makeup before so
if you do I know how I created this look
and also my thoughts on some of their
products you're watching so I have
already filled in my brows and as you
can tell because they're looking a
little crazy right now so just sorry I
mean I mean they're there but it's just
because I have no other makeup on right
now so there is you see a brow beat up
micro-fine brow pencil and up brush in
the color neutral Brown looks like this
look at this little guy he's so did he
look so thin so I'll insert a clip in
now of me if doing eyebrows just you
guys can see in action I mean why do you
read like about the pencil is it is
really really fine
so you can create those hair like
strokes with it which is nice and also
the spoolie is really really good like
it really comes to products through only
thing I don't like about it now I think
this is just where I'm not used to using
pencils but it took me so long to fill
in my eyebrows which I mean that's a
little bit of a pain will I be replacing
of this with my everyday promise I
normally use probably not don't get me
wrong with eyebrow pencils go this is
good this is a good pencil but it just
took me so long and I mean if I can save
time you know I'm gonna be like it was
made for people if you know more
naturally Cilla brows which that's not
me that's not me that's like ELISA and I
definitely was not blessed in that
department mr. de prime others
the one that I'm going to use if the D
slick complexion primer shine control
pore minimizing and master buying
signing for all might really scare
people out there I feel you not reading
up about this and it says a little bit
goes a long way put it in kind of your
oily areas and also to Pat don't rub so
those are likely what I'm going to do oh
my god don't you just love that sound
so sighs I've always liked strange it's
kind of like a serum
Jenny kind of situations I'm going to
put on my nose chin forehead I just
really want to rub this wow that is so
strange it's gone like really sick and
like tight in the areas that I put it
like it really feels maps is so strange
excluding my skin I'm not gonna lie
still so smooth like I put a layer of
powder on my skin okay as a decay I see
you bringing out the Newsies that's cool
that I have never used anything like
that before in my life
and I genuinely feel like well just
going for what it feels I can win so
that's going to help control my oils for
my foundation I'm going to use these
this is the garnet GZA see all eyes are
waterproof lovely liquid okay so I just
said liquid into the liquid foundation
full coverage matte finish oil-free
foundation now just so you guys know I
do actually have a full review video
this up on my channel already which if
you are interested I will leave in the
description box below just thought I'd
let you know it's no pressure or
anything later so result out there so
I've got the colors I can read the 4.0
and 6.0 so before I started filming guys
I was jamming to end up who remembers
and does like honestly major throwback I
was loving it and loved end up back in
the day so this foundation is honestly
no joke I get pretty thick
it's full of coverage where's my top lip
gonna come back I'm going to be honest
with you guys this isn't my favorite
foundation ever it's a little bit
who have you send me like I don't need
this much coverage but if you do
appreciate a good full coverage of
salvation like this some serious stuff
then check this out now I've actually
tried this concealer out before but it
was ages ago and I genuinely can't
remember why for that it is the naked
skin at weightless complete coverage
concealer in lights warm now I know
everyone used to rave about this whoa
it's actually pretty sick why don't I
remember it being this thick I'm also
going to highlight my face with it after
use okay into the finish that could I'd
be like new huh I'm disgusting that has
really nice coverage it's not the
easiest consider cement oh I think
that's just where it's quite sick though
but the finish is really nice and the
coverage is really nice Linden's and oh
my gosh getting it down arm I'm more
covered though that's a really nice base
now we're going to set the base in place
these slick mattifying powder
I just realized everything in this video
is like a mattifying and oil controlling
didn't even mean for that to happen I'm
not complaining because I'm like an oily
mess but so this is what the packaging
looks like wanna see I feel like a
verdict a kill it with a package in any
way to be fair and then oh it is
literally just a white powder I hope
this doesn't come off like white on my
skin like leave a white cast okay
instantly I can see that so mattifying
blimey so it made my skin look really
smooth as well there is literally no
shine on my face whatsoever like my face
is matte I have to say that it's doing a
really good job it's only because my
face is like not tacky whatsoever I am
seriously not used to my face being this
matte right now I'm just going to like
drown myself in highlighter imagine that
anyway but that's made my skin look
really smooth I feel like I've a really
nice right babe I need some color on
this because
naked flushed noona palette noona so
basically this is a all pre a bronzer
highlight and blush what if you go from
looking at it I think I'm going to try
at the bronzer the highlight I don't
think I'm going to use this blush so
because I mean bit too bright for me and
I'm not really a blush girl in the first
place it does look really really warm
now I'm hoping it doesn't come off to
read on my skin it's actually a really
really nice color like it is super warm
like it's definitely a bronzer for sure
but it's really nice it's a guy sound so
strange but I really really like the
pigmentation of it like you can really
build the color up to what you want so
you're not like you know dipping in and
then the whole freaking palette goes on
your face when that happens she's like
game over really nice formula really
easy to blend and look patchy I really
like the color if you actually have
another beluche though also go 8 hour
powder blush in the color fetish down
into subnetting wrote this is the color
all that's pretty it's like a movie pink
blusher which makes me nervous
some are just like so pigmented and it
just scares me shows to it actually you
know what I'm not mad at it it's a
really pretty color it is pigmented
though like calm calm down kind of glow
to it I don't know it's just made my
cheeks look really healthy negative
actors palette I'm going to highlight
like I am praying that this highlight is
good okay
oh yeah so no Lee's gonna lie I was a
little bit nervous because I have it yet
the illuminated tree and now as much as
this pains me to say because I love ever
the Canada brand this this is just a
flop like all brands appear misses so
it's not me bushing under care the brand
but these are just like pure glitter I
don't understand they're it's just not
highlight it's we just did not
disappoint
I love this palette that is the base
down guys I'm going to be honest I am so
impressed with the way that my like face
looks right now looks really flawless I
don't have any complaints about any of
the products so far now I'm going to
move on to my apples deploy my eyes I'm
going to use the eyeshadow primer potion
now I've never probably used it but I
know people used to raise about their
okay so gently coming up the
discoloration on my eyelids nicely and
it feels super tacky which I guess is a
good thing so the I should have
something to stick to
now I have quite a few urban decay
palettes but this one I've used before
this is by far one of my favorites so
I'm going to use it I don't have to
first impressions but their palettes are
not the cheapest and I want to share
with you guys something that is
definitely worth purchasing this is the
naked ultimate basics palette honestly
these eyeshadows are bomber
I'm a colors are honestly make these do
not disappoint let me tell you that I'm
gonna go in with pregame I'm just going
to use that to set my eyelids just so
everything is nice and smooth for the
artist to blend up now taking extra
better which is just the orange and put
this sort of like into my crease above
the crease that sort of area honestly
these eyeshadows are so pigmented I
forget sometimes and I like go in and
like what it's okay though because
they're so easy to blend out so it
doesn't even matter I also don't take me
I shadow on the outer corner as well
like bring it up kind of winging it out
then ugly to me right now because I'll
tell you up at the end but I'm going to
take faith now and just pop that kind of
all over my lid like this and kind of
into the crease just at the base for the
darker Brown
these items just blend into each other
so nicely I literally don't have to try
and I'm not that good with eyeshadows if
I can do a look where I don't have to
try so smart kind of look I'm going to
take a look out which is the even darker
Brown and just go over the top of that
pretty much I'm actually just going to
keep building up until I get as intense
as I want it to be if you're taking the
same set of brown and oranges and
popping up on at the lower lash line
bring it down quite far because kind of
want to be smoky I am now we're taking
one of these a little these look so
pretty
liquid moondust eyeshadow so it's
basically just like a gel glitter I
assume yes I'm going to put that in the
middle of my eyelid and then I'm also
putting some on my like the middle of my
lower lash line just turning it out a
little bit of my finger my mascara I'm
taking the perversion mascara this is
bigger blacker better
so the brushes are all that is a big
Brush sure what that has not done a bad
job on my lashes at all I would
definitely say this mascara though is
more of a volumizing mascara supposed to
lengthening obviously it does links in
but there is way more volume I'm gonna
attempt to do my bottom lashes with this
brush okay probably should not on that
I'm actually scared that I'm going to
pick myself in the eye mask R itself is
really good like it's um such a good job
to my lashes however the brush is really
big that I missed up quite a few times
and I actually have mascara all over my
hands just a personal thing I don't feel
like this look is complete of that
lashes so I'm going to quickly go ahead
and apply some lashes and then I'll do
that for the last thing I have to do
guys is lips now I have this lip palette
from Urban Decay so I thought hey why
not use it because i never use lip
palette this is the advice lipstick
palette it just looks like this and then
you open it up
ma'am so many colors I saw I post
everything this palette as nudes Browns
pinks reds darks everything so I think
I'm going to go in and mix to give a
vanished and 1993 they're just like
nudie brownie pink colors actually
before I do that I'm just going to line
my lips with the playful them glide on
lip pencil in insanity just have a guide
usually pencils are so nice on a few
minutes you just glide on
honestly this is so creamy and that's a
really pretty color and then the last
thing I want to do to my tips to kind of
want them to be a little bit more matte
and just feeling a little bit more like
in place because obviously it's quite
creamy formula so I'm just going to take
some powder and just put it over the top
just a little bit so that's I guys this
is the completed look honestly I am
really happy with the way it turns out
there's only a couple things that didn't
really work personally for me but
honestly I bring your prayers I love
