back at it again with another YouTube
video today it is Sunday um it's the
Prosecco it gets to Sunday and I'm like
it's the end of the week you go to
service of course like and I literally
just feel like her makeup on my face I
am not going anywhere you guys like we
cheer them we are here chillin she loves
it and I literally thought I may as well
just film it like what hell no so yeah
super super chilled I don't even know
what I'm gonna do if my face yet I'm
thinking maybe like a monochromatic look
so match my lips with my eyes and then
of course super super glowy because when
do I not do that class I feel like I've
not sat down and just done my makeup
like it get ready with me in a home in
here and also I've not really done
makeup that much recently on my channel
also let's just ignore the fact that I
genuinely look like a hard waldare grow
now I'm gonna be using a bunch of my
favorite products in this video too so
let's just get into pencil makeup on my
face my brows are already on so I'm
gonna go onto my eyes just in case you
know we f up the eyes and then I'll if I
do the face first and I've messed up the
face and it you guys know a little bit
off concealer this one by the way is the
Urban Decay all nighter I freaking love
this concealer I love it not just us
like a concealer for your face but also
using it for your eyes that cut crease
is priming it's just so good I will
leave all the products and also brushes
and stuff I use in the description box
just in case oh do forget because we all
know one like blend blend blend zip zip
zip
like she got stuck together do you know
I'm actually gonna do I'm gonna try that
trick of not setting your concealer have
you guys seen it look people have not
been sitting there concealer and
apparently your eyeshadow goes on a lot
more pigmented I don't know Loki does
creep me out a little bit because I feel
like I'm gonna be a crazy mess but I'm
gonna try it let's do it for my later
today just don't mind a is disgusting
this is the make revolution so if I
shoulda palea should have have job love
you girl I'm gonna take this color
here put those in the crease this
position the you should weigh let's put
a full face on and like it not go
anywhere but then I guess the good thing
about that is if this F supp then you
know no one's got to see it it's fine
I'm gonna bring this ear shout will hear
you guys and then I can like clean up
and get that like these eye shadows oh
they are like Pig to the men to the tit
everybody's like doing something super
super easy on my eyes even though it's
not Ettore I want to do something that
you guys can even like do if you wanna
oh I really wanted to use this brush but
it's freaking covered in black I'm gonna
think this little guy right here love
that I literally love it when you can
whack two colors on your eyeballs and
you get sugar blend them together
otherwise you know I don't be striking
mess Oh see now this is the reason why
I'm glad I didn't not do my face for us
to literally always end up getting hello
I mean that worked doing it oh yeah
thank you
taking some concealer again and just why
am i holding my hand up like this
I don't know I'm gonna use this to clean
up that edge you could just use like a
wife or something but I kind of like
consider I feel like with a brush I can
really get it like precise
honestly that is not the most satisfying
thing you've ever seen I don't know
don't worry like I totally know it looks
a little bit crazy right now bar as soon
as you've got like lashes on and
everything like we'll be good
bat cat to give militias honestly I
swear I just need like a trail of
eyelashes behind me ever I go glue wait
for that to dry a little bit what do we
do while we wait what was your guys's
favorite drink like alcoholic drink of
course if you're age I will probably
have to be Prosecco you know like just
kind of one oh you know that like
life-threatening moment where you nearly
poke yourself in the eye with mascara
and you genuinely think you're about to
go blind that's happened well yeah that
was easy
okay like thank you very much it's a
good eyelash okay thank you Jesus by the
way these lashes they are I think they
are by a brand called lashes by Lucy and
they're in the style effortless I'm
obsessed with these I just love how like
they are all right let's see if this
eyelash wants to go on or whether wants
to play me right so far so good in a
corner what the Freak you know on
something in your makeup routine goes so
well that you're just waiting for some
it to go bad that's me now like
something's gonna go she on my face now
I'm gonna move on to my face makeup I
don't know about you guys but face
makeup is honestly my favorite part once
I've done my eyes I'm like oh yeah so
I'm gonna go ahead and prep my skin now
we're all here for the glow right and
honestly I'm about to show you guys a
product that I wish I could literally
just drown my entire body in that
product
it's little gory this is the iconic
London prep set glow spray so you can
use this stuff as your prime you can use
it to set your makeup you can use it
when you just want to glow literally
head to toe
I couldn't land your hand I hit me up
and was like jaws like we know you love
to glow you should try this
see I've teamed up with them just for
this product in this video just this not
anything else just this I've actually
been using this for the past like I'd
say two weeks
I used Instagram live I've been like
black every day I personally love to
just to set my makeup and I'd like a
final blow but I will show you what it
looks like on bare skin because if you
like me and you love having a no makeup
day this makes your skin look warm as it
comes in two different like shades I get
shades - that's the right word more like
champagne e gold and then a like bronze
color don't be fooled by the color so
all skin tones can use both colors I use
this one this is like my most used one
as you can probably tell
so basically when it's settled it looks
like this but shake them up
and you'll be able to see the magic
happen in like look at this hi
like how cool is that it's like swelling
around and stuff like it's cool the cool
thing about this right I didn't even
realize when I started using it because
anything Chloe I'm like hey whoa I did a
little bit of research and there's some
cool ingredients in here man like stuff
that is really really good for your skin
yeah we've got like the fake glow with
this but it genuinely is gonna help your
skin underneath so 2 and 1/2 in freakin
1 I mean I don't wanna get one like
science-u on you guys it's because like
I mean I got a D for a reason I know
this like you come back greens here like
a mama there's a ton of stuff in here so
it's like really glowy but moisturizing
and soothing and just I'm just gonna get
to spraying on my face now why I'm gonna
do though is just cover my eyes cuz I've
said I'm gonna get any like glow or my
eyes you guys are about to see what this
does
okay to your skin oh my god it smells
gorgeous smells like kike refresh and
kind of a little bit like babies at the
same time you guys see the glow on my
skin that is genuinely just this just
this um I mean you can see why I've been
using this for two weeks right you know
what let's just go in my body to the
body glow it's so real right now here's
my torch on it hopefully you guys can
see it has like little bits of shimmer
in it so the glows like really really
emphasized and just looks fab so now on
to foundation I'm gonna be using the UM
decay all nighter foundation I'm in
shade 5.0 I have been obsessed with this
foundation recently like look at this
coverage blast coverage it lasts on my
skin because I have all
af Skinner I mean I say this all the
time you guys probably think of me
saying yeah but it's true I do I don't
feel like this foundation genuinely
helps control them I was mixing this in
for a while with my maybelline superstay
foundation still obsessed with the heart
and then I found that as soon as I
started mixing this in with other
Maybelline I got kind of like Leslie
then I just started using this one it's
not the only thing okay the only other
thing about this foundation that I don't
like is it oxidizes so finding your
shade was a little bit of a pain in the
bum do you know what there this is
actually a pretty freakin matte
foundation but that glow from those
iconic sprays is peeping through I used
to see you
concealer now to cover up can open it I
need to cover whatever the heck is going
on here this is the ex1 delete fluid
concealer thingy will be coverage it
from it looks good
basically everything you'd want from a
concealer like this concealer is that
also come we will just talk about this
sponge for a second this sponge is from
a brand called sport effects holy crap
it is so good it's like the squishiest
little thing ever gonna set my face pack
this fish on before my face literally
melts off oh by the way this powder it's
the Maybelline fit me loose powder I'm
pretty sure you can't get over here I
got it when I was in LA is a really
really nice powder it's all my favorite
powder in the world it's nothing like I
thought of I mean it's still nice though
so it's Gucci hmm she's empty she needs
her ring yeah that noise is really
satisfying for some reason forms an out
because I'm looking oh you'll pale for
me be bold
runs the guys now if you love the really
really warm toned bronzers you know that
matte give me some that kind of thing
you are actually gonna live breathe die
over this bronzer
let me tell you I just love the warmth
of it like this is the toner I'd go for
in a bronzer debuff I'm just bronzing up
literally my entire face because God
forbid it needs it I mean I've probably
gone a little bit crazy by this point
with the bronzer but um
it's fun let me just ducky on that down
yeah I legit flew like a human again
lube F contour now this is the M decay
naked skin shapeshifter palette I mixed
these two shades together I have been
obsessed with this but she pigmented
quite cheekbone it was like Jordan you
literally just said it was pigmented and
then you go do that Pony excess down my
nose just because I mean I don't have a
reason to be honest I just I just do it
okay but lush I think I'm gonna take
this one from Mac this is the
mineralized blush in the color sweet
enough I feel like it's kind of pretty
with the eyes yeah that's the color one
I feel like blush is so underrated does
anybody else think that like honestly
blush just adds so much more life back
into your skin I think it just looks so
pretty I have never used that color
before but that is gorge now actually on
second second let me just do some
carving everybody's favorite part now
some highlight the iconic olam dune
shimmer palette so this is like the
highlight palette and I'm gonna take
this shade here this is called shimmer
and shine I'm using a foam brush my
highlighter who even am I I never use a
fan brush for my highlights I cuz I
never think that dense enough I like a
really dense brush too you know I can
pack on that highlight because you know
that I wear like the entire pan on my
face but this one from Sigma this is the
strobe and fan this is so dense and I
really feel like I look buff and it just
I love it moving blimey this really is
shimmer and shine about my nose Cupid's
bow I've been loving putting a little
bit above my eyebrows here as well hey
yeah
let me just dust off this situation here
because you know I'm overlooking like a
beardyman real quick I'm just gonna go
ahead and finish off underneath my eyes
same two colors that we use on our lid
underneath easy peasy lemon squeezy
gonna bring it down quite Fox I want it
to be quite smoky also gonna do
something that I never ever do I don't
know if you have ever noticed but I
never put bomb lash mascara on I always
put it on and then I regret it I just
don't you suits me but here I am about
to do it in a video
logic what do you think there is any I
still don't know I guess I'm just not
used to seeing myself with it on I'm
like on the fence you know I'm like yes
no maybe old friend lastly now is
actually no second-to-last things I
still gonna set my face I mean I need to
because I'm not going anywhere
I'm gonna use this makeup forever liquid
lipstick this is in the color 109 I feel
like this will go quite nicely with the
eyes these make up for a liquid
lipsticks are probably I would probably
have to say my all-time favorite formula
on liquid lipstick FR they are so matte
but not drying one there yeah yeah
they're thoroughly works I can't talk
and I do I let so I'm just like it's out
here in silence like
I'm also going to put on a little bit of
1:03 as well just kind of in the center
and Pat that out just because it needs
to be a teeny bit lighter then I'm
finishing up with a little bit of my
chronic prep set &amp;amp; Glow do you know I
still can't believe that this done this
on my body look at this mad now how I
use this to finish up my makeup as you
can see this gives a clue
I'm oily so on my kind of like everyday
basis I like to use this in specific
places just so I can like concentrate
the glow exactly when it's sorry I'm
just gonna cover my eyes again obviously
so I don't get all my eye makeup and I'm
gonna spray it just on these sides of my
face where I put the highlights are and
keep it away from my t-zone feels so
good and it really helps it kind of like
melt your makeup in and then it gives
you this overall like jewy nurse of
freaking obsessed glow in seconds let me
just tell my brightness down real quick
and shine my torch you can see the real
glow I mean you can miss you already see
it but even in my face I know it I have
so much fun from this video for you guys
