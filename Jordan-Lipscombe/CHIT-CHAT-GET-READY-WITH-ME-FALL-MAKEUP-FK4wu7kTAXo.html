is gonna be like a chitchat get ready
with me while I do my makeup look
tutorial thing up it's only makeup that
I'm wearing right now it's just very
kind of full inspired so like a smokey
purple eye unlike a dark vampy lip and
this lip color though I used one of the
new body shop liquid lipsticks I'm
currently obsessed with but the formula
of these is incredible so different
other liquid lipsticks you'll hear me
talk about it more in the video and I'm
also going to save the color so if you
want to know what color this is and you
have to keep watching I feel like the
lip is like the statement of this makeup
look so if you do want to know how I did
this and just kind of listen to me chat
then keep watching okay so today's video
I'm thinking it's going to be a kind of
chitchat get ready with me style video
because I feel like I haven't sat down
and spoke to you guys like this in a
while and that makes me really sad
don't really know what I'm going to do
my makeup today I'm kind of feeling full
inspired so maybe something smoke your
on the eyes and like a dark red lip I
don't know so I just want to point out
the line in this video I don't think is
that great I'm using two out of three
lights at the moment because one of my
lights fell over I'm the bulb smashed so
are appearing like no I'm just working
with what I've got trying to like bounce
the light by its kind of difficult and I
feel like I'm really washed out but
we're working with what we've got okay
so I have already filled in my eyebrows
just to save some time because I feel
like this video is going to be pretty
long anyways and but just so you know I
used I use the freedom eyebrow pomade in
medium brown and then the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow definer in medium
brown as well and then for the pomade I
just used this like a double-ended
Primark brush actually yeah Primark and
it's really really good I use it every
single day it's just got a angled brush
on one side and a spoolie on the other
I will try in this video to mention as
many brushes that I'm using as I can
because I know you guys always like
Jordan freaking mention your brushes
because you want to know what you use so
I will try my best to remember to tell
you guys okay for I do anything I'm just
going to apply some Vaseline
because they are hella dry I feel like
my lips look so pink what is happening
okay right anyways I'm actually going to
get on it with the makeup but so to
prime my skin I'm going to use the NYX
primer spray I've only ever used it a
couple of times but it feels amazing on
my sketch woah like almost choked I feel
like I just want to do like a Jeffrey
star and just keep spraying on my face
because it feels that good for my
foundation today I'm going to use
something that I haven't used in a hot
minute and this is the Bourjois healthy
mix foundation and I'm in the color dark
beige which is number 55 I think this
will match me yeah I think we'll be okay
I'm just going to blend that in with a
sponge this is clean I promise
it's just stained like I do clean my
sponges and my brushes promise oh yeah
so I think it was last week you guys I
had like the worst skin break out ever
so I think I reacted to some sort of new
skincare product that I use and I'm not
kidding like this whole bottom half of
my face I have just completely broken
out everywhere I'm still kind of
recovering from it like all he are still
just like some texture and some bumps
and scarring and on my chin basically my
skin it just did not look great but you
know it happens it was just annoying
because the day that I happened like two
days after that I had a video shoot with
another YouTube channel and my skin was
awful so it just couldn't have been
worth the time and basically on another
note though this foundation looks really
nice I really like the coverage and the
finish of it is all glowy so for my
concealer I'm going to use the good old
Mac Pro Longwear this is in NC 25 I'm
just going to take a pump of that
interest conceal and highlight my face
and I'm just using that same sponges
just to blend everything together
oh yeah also guys a little life update I
am now a full-time youtuber that YouTube
is my job which I am so excited about it
just means I'm going to have way more
time at literally all the time in the
world to film videos so you will
definitely be seeing me a lot more I
don't know if that's a good or bad thing
but okay honestly just feel so blessed
though because this is what I've always
wanted to do and to be able to do it now
I'm going to start all this hard work in
place I'm going to use the RCM a no
color powder this is like one of my
favorite how does like fake with because
it really brightens and just I like it
okay I just opened that and it literally
went all over me oh okay that was
probably too much
Wow I look great
I'm actually just gonna use the same
powder to set the rest of my face I'm
using a real techniques powder brush
because I pulled out way too much and I
don't want to waste it
oh my god I actually have palette
everywhere I'm gonna dust this off now
because I don't have to leave on for too
long otherwise it is pretty intense so
I'm just dusting off with this neck
there oh eight brush I think we can all
guess what bronzer I'm going to use
because I just it's my favorite I can't
not use it it is the Mac gives me Sun
ones off I'm just going to you up use
being NYX 0 3 brush to blend that in I
just hope it loving this brush for the
bronzer because it's really like domes
and round so it really just pops into
the skin just just I'd give it
lip on the nose so I'm going to use this
makeup geek contour powder in WoW Jordan
Wow
it's called complicated which is the
cool medium shade I'm just going to use
this just to carve out my cheekbones use
this Real Techniques setting brush
now if you can see a difference but I
mean I can
for my blushes out already you wear
blush but I'm using one from this Nick
sweet cheeks palette
which is amazing I feel like there's a
blush for like every single makeup look
so just using this Real Techniques cheek
brush I'm actually going to take this
orange shade here I feel like that will
go nicely
I literally have the roundest cheeks
ever so now it's time for my favorite
part of makeup ever highlight I have not
tried this yet so I'm just so excited
because I know it's give me life this is
a makeup revolution ultra pro glow and
color though there's just eight shades
in here I don't know if the camera is
doing it justice but like holy crap I'm
excited looking for this one and the
brush that I've been obsessed with for
my highlighter I can't find so I'll link
it below so I'm just using like a little
blending brush for now so oh my god my
god can you guys see that I'd be
surprised if you couldn't because that
is like it pretty intense that is so
nice that is like not Glee - real
sparkly in any way that literally looks
like my skin is wet my god oh my god
okay you need this you need this think
it was like ten pounds and you get eight
different shades in here actually
reminds me a lot of the Anastasio
Beverly Hills glow kick colorize kind of
but mainly like formula wise because it
genuinely looks wet on the skin not like
glitter or anything at all blends really
easily
only texture of them they're really
smooth like really soft like the other
stars in Beverly Hills one so I'm just
doing you guys in nugs I'm going to star
the eyes so to prime them I'm going to
take my Urban Decay primer potion the
eyeshadow palette that I'm going to use
today is this is the money mu8 and
makeup geek eyeshadow palette in Japan
we just
it's so beautiful when I start off with
this color here which is called beaches
and cream I'm just going to use this on
a fluffy brush as my transition
I'm now taking my Sigma e 38 which is
when my favorite eyeshadow brushes ever
and then taking a mixture of Sora and
frappe which like these brown colors
here and I'm just going to work that in
the crease more I'm kind of on the outer
corner
I'm literally just using kind of
windscreen wiper motions just to blend
that back and forth I'm kind of
extending it out as well by my eye here
to kind of wing the eyeshadow out a
little bit so now on a Real Techniques
base shadow brush I'm going to take a
mixture of Mars here and Afra die and
just blend that on to my crease I'll
just pack it on just you start creating
that kind of smoky eye oh my god look of
me I mean you said that is yes
oh my camera just died but you didn't
really miss much all that I did was just
pack the eyeshadows on this eye as well
and then I took that same Sigma brush
with the excess products on and just
sort of did this just like buffed out be
like purpley red that we put on on it
and that's all all the colors we use on
top I'm going to use on bottom so I'm
just gonna take Sora and frappe and just
buff the underneath
and then I'm gonna take a little pencil
brush and just take Mars and Aphrodite
and just put that as close to my lower
lashline as I can
I'm gonna take this makeup geek
full-spectrum coal liner pencil and just
pop this in my waterline
or my mascara I'm going to take the
Urban Decay perversion and just pop this
on but I will be applying false lashes
as well I'm going to take the NYX wicked
lashes but they're in the style frisky
Joe don't usually go for lushes like
this because they're quite sure and I
like quite long and wispy ones but
adding a lot of volume in them I'm
actually liking them so anyway to finish
off this makeup look we're going for a
dark lip this is the bodyshop matte slip
liquid weight war lip basically it's
their matte liquid lipstick and this is
in the shade Mauritius Dahlia I think
that's how you say it's number 17 which
is just like this dark really purple I
was debating between this and yep lost
it I'm here is the Sicily iris one which
is this one which is a dark purple but
I'm feeling more kind of ready on the
lips so we're going to go for this one
I'm going to be brave and I'm going to
go straight in and not use a lip liner
either so wish me luck
these are literally it just glide
straight on I think what I love about
these is the formula they're different
to most liquid lipsticks the more of a
moosie formula which I actually prefer
because when they dry down they don't
feel like they're drawing the moisture
out of your lips if you're I mean like
they don't feel really dry and heavy and
uncomfortable they dry down to a really
comfortable finish and I love that how I
tease so this is the completed look guys
I hope that you liked it it was actually
kind of fun to just sit here and kind of
play with makeup and create the look as
I went along so I hope it turned out all
right and I hope that you guys liked it
