brand new video feeling pretty good
right now coming to you today with a
makeup tutorial tutorial it's just under
showing you what I put on my face I'm
not makeup artist I'm not the best of
makeup I'm just a 19 year ago sits a
home plays with her makeup because she
loves their that is literally me so as
the holiday season is approaching you
know Christmas is literally like a month
away what's the hell when did this
happen
I'd like not prepared at all I've got
not any of my Christmas shopping but
this for my life so yeah now that it is
that time of year I wanted to create a
kind of holiday inspired makeup look I
kept it super classic gold glitter red
lip classic and for this video I have
teamed up with the body shop you guys
know my love for The Body Shop like it's
clear I work with them like all the time
but I work with them because I love them
I love them as a brand I love the people
there everyone is just so far but I
really believe in their products and I
am like so down like totally down for
what they stand for I rule that brand
this look was created with all body shop
makeup and brushes so if you do want to
know how I created this look then it
just clear watch it
okay I'm serving holid foredeck realness
right now okay so I pretty much just
switch on the camera like it's been on
for like 0.3 seconds and everything has
been happenin okay first me at my mic
it's just not really working it's not
working how are you so it doesn't sound
how it used to it's low-key stressing me
out and another thing I sound so list me
right now it's kind of annoying me I try
not to film with my own design and just
you know I don't sound like this but I
really should have been so we should got
off the wrong with it kicking off this
makeup look with my brows because as you
can see they already done I use this
little guy from the body shop to do them
holy crap I have not seen something like
this from any brand like ever it is so
different is so cool even though my
brows are already done I will of course
include a clip over the top of me
talking to us and see what the crack
like is with it so this is that brow
sculpt three-in-one contouring a brow
pen on one end we have a little lip
crayon a brow pencil twist up as well
you know I'm going to take that time to
sharpen it let's be real well
I basically used this end to start
outlining my brows start to get that
shape that I want and then I start to
lightly fill them in with this pencil as
well it is definitely more of like a
waxy pencil I will say that but it has
done a SAP job I keep doing this for my
brows and I don't I don't really know
why and then you unscrew this end and
you have this little like don't think
we've like powder on what I use this
little end here to fill in the front of
my brow because obviously powders are a
lot soft us what its gonna do it's gonna
create that like natural gradient for us
I'm not joking guys this was so freakin
easy to do I just did like this a few
times and I like instantly had the
gradient it was a little bit gray and
then this literally doesn't end here
this thing goes on forever yes there's a
little spooley with brow gel now how I
actually use this first of all is a
deeper little brush into it now start to
create little fake bro in this at the
front of my eyebrow works like perfectly
for that and then of course I do use it
how all brow gels I use I use it to kind
of set my entire brow because we don't
want that ish sliding off at least and
then the last gap should take a little
bit of concealer and clean up the brow
to make it look super neat and that is
it that is all I did for my brows I am
not kidding it was so quick and easy I
was like a little bit of face makeup now
I'm gonna take two things to prep my
skin because I don't know I just won't
do it that's what I'm her tail
that's definitely well loved by me that
actually is a little bit gross like her
even I'm okay this is that all-in-one
instable primer it does a bunch of stuff
but I really like it for like smoothing
up my pores and then this is all guys
this is their drops of glow illuminating
luster finish creep wait more I think
I'm just like reading everything on this
bowl it's there like drops of glow it's
basically just a liquid illuminator I
take the insta blur first see you paused
oh that sound I just want to like add
some drops to my skin like yeah I
actually feel like one of them Instagram
girls now
and just blend this in I'm using the
bodyshop flat brush by the way all the
brushes and of course the makeup
products are the body shop but
everything would of course be linked
below because you know this is me and I
probably would forget to tell you
something oh my god this is so nice I
haven't used this and like a hot minute
and I forgot how healthy it makes my
skin look oh girl I am glowing I would
genuinely just put this on my skin ago
at the house because it just makes my
skin look really healthy a little bit
foundation now this is their Matt clay
skin clarifying foundation I'm using 0 5
5 but I'm gonna mix in a little bit of 0
to 6 just because this is a little bit
too dark for me at the moment give it a
little shake bounce set in with my booty
blender I do this because it's actually
like the body shop version I really like
it it's a teeny teeny teeny teeny bit
harder than I the sponges bar it burns
on my foundation that was fat by the way
I just like to lost my voice for some
reason oh I just got that all over my
area this formation is so nice it has
really really good coverage I'd say
probably hind medium and then you can
build on it to get it like full I'm a
full coverage gal so it works for me oh
my god it was so funny the last time I
use this foundation it'll literally
squat okay I hate the word squatted but
it did it is squared everywhere like
roll clip I just literally pooed my
pants
what just happened I want to see when I
film video sometimes I'm such a hot mess
it's not even funny
it went like all over my desk on my
floor mum and dad I'm sorry
everything don't mean drag it down my
neck a little bit because um I wanna
Matt show kiss on me please thank you
we've got to get some concealer going
we've got to cover up their self
situation here this is that all-in-one
consider which is like a little stick
now don't normally really like crayon
e-type concealers like this but this one
is actually really nice I still am
hoping that the body shop will come up
with more like a liquid wand concealer
but this one like the low key reminds me
of more like a thicker liquid can see a
light in a stick form it kind of just
like melts into the skin you know when
you
blending it out I don't know quite like
it and actually has really good coverage
as well which I need that my body clock
guys it's all it's all kinds of messed
up I like work and do stuff during the
night and then obviously all I wanna do
is sleep in the day like why here they
lose powder now just to set this in a
place set these under eyes you know we
don't want any creasing happening they
said she feels like perfect underneath
my eyes it's like that little tapered
brush this is posh not the cute sort of
thing you've ever seen
gotta set the rest on my face if you're
new here I have to like all your skin
ever so of course that Hough they're
like Reese everything in place because
then when my face will probably melt off
to bronze up to bronze up my face I'm
taking their honey bronze bronzer I
always use this thing because it's so
good like that actually I hate myself I
hate myself
half of them all over the floor but okay
these are there like bronzing shimmer
bull pole thingies and I'm just bringing
it like over the top I'd like a really
sunkissed glow but the honey bronzer by
the way I use their a for then come into
the pearls and just add that it is very
very warm like very very warm you can
see that but cuz I'm tanned I think I
can kind of like get away with that now
we're looking bronze yes I'm now going
in with the body shop contour palette
this one is the deep to dr. deep skin
one I'm gonna be using the highlight
blush and this shade here to contour
they do of course have a lighter one for
like Sarah skin tones as well I'm gonna
go back into that tapered brush again
with a little bit of this because this
is so pigmented I don't know where my
blush brush is I'm just gonna use this
one again because I don't know where is
oh that's pretty but has a bit of like a
sheen to it it's nice though and then of
course a little bit of highlighter first
I'm gonna take their honey bronzer
bronzing dome this is basically like a
cream highlighter this is so good I feel
like this is a little hidden gem in the
body shop it's gonna pop my cheekbones
by the way I warm up on my finger first
and I just do this see I do try to put
this onto foundation and not powder but
if you forget like I did today you can
put on top of powders it doesn't break
up or make it go funny or anything oh
and then on that fan brush with a little
bit of the highlighter wow that legit
looks where I've not used this highlight
at the floor but on top of that honey
bronze holy moly I just poked myself in
the eye book that's super pretty super
super pretty okay so as you can see I'm
looking a little bit different I didn't
really know what I wanted to do so I
decided to go off camera do something
and then I can do it on this I kind of
went for this like half moon cut crease
gold glitter thing just so you know I
have already prepped my eye concealer
powder you guys know I'm now taking this
block the eye at blending brush and some
of the bronzer that we used earlier the
honey bronze I'm just going to starts
put that in at the crease going back and
forth just to blend that out kind of us
our transition as our crease color doing
it a bit of both I legit love this brush
I think it's so good it's like the
perfect size do you know what I mean
making sure I'm getting like right in
the inner corner and the outer corner
and kind of keeping it in this off shape
but I honestly don't even know how I
think I can like do makeup tutorials on
my channel because I just chat ish now
that that's that the intensity that I
like I'm gonna go in it with this eye
shadow it's I do just but I believe it's
2:00 to 5:00 it's just a really nice
like cool toned Brown I'm gonna use this
double-ended brush from never has an
angled brush one end and then more of a
fluffy one using the fluffy side dip it
in and just put that on the outer corner
here the inner corner and then just
blend this owl and self together like
bring over the top kind like a halo eye
I feel like it looks crazy right now but
yes okay now it's time to cut the crease
we're gonna flip this brush around I'm
gonna use this little angled side and
basically with some concealer we're
gonna start to like cut the crease in
this like Halfmoon shape so I'm just
kind of following at the natural shape
of my crease and then I'm going a little
bit higher as well just so when I look
forward you can still see like the
glitter
I honestly used to think that cut
creases were like the hardest thing ever
I mean I'm still not really that good
with them but they honestly aren't as
hard as you think like just keep
practicing get used to your eye shape
and then you'll be like BAM
that one is not as we thought this I
shoulda doesn't have a name it's just
like a creamy white color I'm just gonna
set that in
lace okay so something you're not the
neatest cut crease I've seen in my life
but up now I'm taking this body shop eye
color stick in the color barley Sunstone
it's this amazing like orangey pinky
shade I'm just gonna start to take some
from the little stick thingy basically
just putting it everywhere that the
concealer is this is basically going to
act as a very nice base for when we put
the gold glitter on top it will kind of
slightly show through and I don't know
it just gives the glass something to
stick to as well they're like you don't
have to use glitter glue
we're just felt because you know we're
killing two birds with one stone time
for everyone's favorite part the glitter
the bodyshop have come out with glares
which i think is amazing I know they
have this gold one in a pink one as well
it's called glitter dust how cute is
this isn't a little star we're just
gonna pack this issue on glitter is my
favorite thing you can you could also go
in with like an angled brush just to get
it like right by the edge you do you boo
whatever you got to do to get that
glitter on there you feel me to be fair
it probably would've been a better idea
to do my eyes first or like packed some
powder under here so it would catch the
glitter but hey okay that definitely
still is clear my taste but I can't get
it off now to do the wing I'm using this
this is not a really really cool product
that I haven't seen any other brand half
before doll stamp or liner so basically
this is very cool on one ends you have
your little felt tip liner which is
really nice do you know the really good
thing about this liner guys so I use pen
liners before and when you're halfway
through doing your wing they like run
out and you have to hold them like this
so that the ink like come down this one
doesn't run out I managed to do my
entire wing and more like I've even done
more with just this little felt tip
impressive if you ask me and then on the
other end how cool is this
there is a little star stamp look I
could be like I could just do this all
day okay let's uh let's try and nail
this wing I'm used to get like up close
and personal my mirror right now cuz
this is like frickin surgery
we nourish out bring it back in then you
know fill it in I think that's like a
this we're gonna get really but just to
show you guys as you can see there is
still way more in clipped in this thing
bloody good that is is pretty good
whether it's clear my eyeliner isn't as
black as it could be so I'm just gonna
go in with that liquid eyeliner which
this stuff is bomb I'm just gonna go
over the top just make it really really
super black just gonna know like jiraiya
open up my eye and like transfer I will
be applying at some eyelashes because
josh is on my life but of course I want
a pilot but mascara just so you know we
can blend everything together this
glitter on my face is really annoying me
I'm surface annoying you this is their
lash hero eye widening lush Reviver
mascara so basically this does volume or
length and it conditions your lashes
and guys let's be real here I can you
know have fab lashes but like have them
you know being all healthy and stuff at
the same time you know I will look at my
lashes with this mascara I see you I'm
just gonna quickly go ahead pop these
lashes on and I'll be back to finish off
this makeup look so the very very last
them to do now is a lip so I think a
nude lip of course would look amazing
with this this is one of the body shot
matte liquid lipsticks in lisp on
freesias is zero to three how amazing
would that look I just love a nude lip
by always to a nude lips I'm gonna try
to like do some little bit different so
because this is like holiday inspired
Christmas I think I'm gonna do a red lip
do the whole like gold and red like
classic holiday makeup look so gonna
start by lining my lips with their lip
define a crayon inch red siren
do you know what I mean these are like
so creamy and so easy to use and so
pigmented and then I'm taking away their
matte liquid lipsticks in Tahiti
hibiscus I think it's called its number
16 it's just it's amazing like perfect
like pillar box red now these do
eventually dry down map they're not like
super matte though which I do really
like because it means they're way more
comfortable it means that it's like
sucking all the moisture out of my lips
thriller I love the form of these liquid
lipsticks I wanted like the most
comfortable out there I think they're
wonderful I can mu see consistency and
not to mention they like they smell
incredible but I do really want that
super super matte lip look so taking
this low product which is like freaking
genius this is the body short instrument
this came out of my face foundation
lipstick literally anything my favorite
thing to use it for is lipstick though
so all that I do I take these smallest
amount ever and watch this watch I'm at
my bottom it will be conversing with
heart pretty can you guys see that so
good so this would be completed like
holiday at Christmasy style at glam
makeup but you know what when I saw that
nude lip I was like I'm gonna want to do
a nude lip but I am feeling this red lip
look obviously this is like super to
make and there's a lot going on but I
love it I thought for Christmas it's so
fun to go without glitter red lips like
why the hell not anyway I think that is
everything from me I really hope you
