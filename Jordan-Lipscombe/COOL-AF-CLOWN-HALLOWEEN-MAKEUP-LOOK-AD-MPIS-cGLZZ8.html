see ya another year another Halloween
makeup look hey guys it's Jordan so look
a bit different so this is the how do we
makeup look that I did today I'm going
to show you guys how you can recreate it
I wanted to kind of do something that
you guys could do even if you found
these bits a little bit too hard you
could still totally do the face makeup
cuz it's pretty simple and what's really
cool is the body shop challenged me to
create how do we make up look so of
course this is done about half in the
fake blood it is all done with makeup no
funny about this let see how all of the
makeup and brushes in this video art by
the body shop I believe everything in
the description box so if you wanna know
check that so it's just like a killer
call-ups gangster looking cloud I know
think it was like a year or maybe two
years back a lot of people were doing
this sort of gang survive crispy down
one there was a load of other people who
did it so mine was sort of inspired by
that but of course I've done the whole
like faked I was a more like killer
gangster rather than just like gangster
clown and I was inspired by a ton of
pictures on Pinterest and Google win all
that so if you do wanna know how to look
like a cool ass clown for Halloween then
just keep watching starting off with a
little bit of Primark this is the
insta-buck primer just to create a nice
base and prep our skin if you know all
that makeup that we're about to put on
our face full foundation I'm using their
Matt clay skin clarifying a foundation I
mix them together two shades to create
my perfect shade and I'm just gonna pop
that all over my face and blend that out
with their buffing brush as well I
actually think this is the perfect
foundation for this one because it has
FEHB coverage and you know I'm all about
a full coverage life and it's matte
which means it makes our life so much
easier when it comes to putting things
on top of it because they'll just sit so
much nicer for concealer now this is
their all in one concealer and as you
can see it is a light shade I believe
it's zero one which is perfect we want
it to be like AF so I'm just putting it
underneath my eyes I'm also putting it
down on my nose and my forehead as well
and then I'm gonna take that same brush
that we used for our foundation and I'm
just gonna Pat the concealer into my
skin you guys in the drill
of course we want to set this face in
place we don't need to go anywhere so
I'm using their loose face powder to do
this Wow Wow I'm a hot mess and then I
use one of their huge kabuki brushes to
you know pile this on I'm not being shy
I'm going to happen I just want to make
sure that my face is super super set
warming up my skin it using one of my
absolute fave this is their honey
bronzed bronzer on a blush brush just
going to warm up the usual places
you guys know
now even though this is a Halloween
makeup look there is always time for a
little bear highlight this is their
little honey dome thing look at that
glow guys can we just can we just
appreciate that like this is so good
what I'm just putting that in all the
usual spots now on to at the fun pass
this is their gel liner pen
we use this for out this entire tutorial
super convenient because it rolls out
which means we haven't got to keep
sharpening it because who has time for
that right so I'm gonna start by
creating the mask bit here so as you can
see I kind of just go up and down create
this shape I mean you guys you can see
what I'm doing wrong he just such a good
youtuber my descriptions are so good and
then just give it a little check to make
sure it's good now taking the black eye
shadow from their down-to-earth app a
layer on this little itty bitty eyeliner
brush I'm gonna start just roughly
shading underneath to create a little
bit more depth and definition and a bit
more realism does not mean the only
thing we are gonna go in and darken it
in a sec and then to darken it I'm using
their black liquid eyeliner it comes in
a little pot like there so I'm just
gonna trace over that exact same line we
made in the beginning just a dark and
everything deepen it create a little bit
more depth and then I'm gonna go back in
with that itty bitty brush and the black
eye shadow to blend everything together
so it's like a nicer and smoother
gradient
and now taking at this dual-ended a
brush kind of looks like an eyeshadow
brush here I'm just taking the brown
eyeshadow from that down-to-earth
palette and just blend that underneath
to create even more gradient it's just
all about adding colors you guys just
keep adding back in with their gel
eyeliner pen we're going to outline the
little nose so I kind of create like
it's here drop shape if you guys can see
that so a little point at the top and
just round it around the nose back at it
again with the liquid liner I'm going to
fill in that little nose imagine if I
could actually fill it in this quick
that'd be fab I'll be done in like 0.2
seconds it'll be great leaving a little
gap though so I can take this white
cacao liner which is partly on the floor
and just to fill in that little gap to
make it a little bit more cartoony onto
the eyes now some using that same
down-to-earth bodyshop palette that we
used earlier taking the brown shade on
this crease brush from the body shop and
basically just whack this in the crease
like look how freakin pigmented that is
it is so good see I'll just keep
blending it it doesn't spin me out all
just off really messy and blown out and
then I'm using the same black eyeshadow
format that palette and just whacking
that onto the lids gonna keep sort of
adding the color and building up till I
get it as intense as I like it and then
using the same crease brush that we used
earlier just blend the two colors
together so there's no lines and it just
looks really smoky and then it just take
them same two colors and smoke them out
under both of our eyes - you know adds
to the smokiness and then I'm going to
swerve off camera and stick on some
false eyelashes now back to the body
shot liquid liner you know and I'm going
to create those triangles that we see
underneath the eyes when it comes to
sort of clown looks I feel like this is
totally a clown vibe so just take my
time
outline it and then fill it in so I'm
doing that underneath both of my eyes
triangles on the bottom means triangles
on the top so I'm just gonna repeat the
exact same thing above my eyebrow this
time I find with the top ones just go
for it I thought f it just draw the
lines I didn't hesitate or anything I
find that the triangles come out a lot
better so little tip for you there and
then again just start filling them in
just for a little added extra something
something I'm drawing two little X's
above the triangles as well and then
we're gonna head back to that gel liner
pencil and I'm gonna start drawing like
fake eyelashes I guess on the bottom
easiest way to do this is start from
like away from your eye and go into your
eye that way you don't suck at the skin
as much and you'll make your life a
little bit easier but not like literally
into your eye like don't do that time
for some lippy I'm going in with a black
liquid lipstick you can just use the
black autoshop eyeliners but I find the
liquid lipstick to be a little bit more
comfortable and then I'm just going in
with the black eyeshadow and I'm gonna
start smudging it out I'm using that
same double-ended brush so I use the
sort of fluffier side first and then
I'll take the angle side like this as
you can see and start making that sort
of smile point like making that sort
creepy ass I can smile thing and then I
thought why not let's just like smudge
the lipstick everywhere make it look
super rough and then it's taking some
fake blood now and I'm gonna use my
fingers using what my mummy gave me I'm
gonna pop that on top and make it look
like we've been in something or someone
put it around the mouth as well just go
just go crazy
taking it something called zombie dirt
now we're moving on to the neck so you
can actually get this format power line
you can to do black eyeshadow but I like
this because it's loose and I'm taking
this huge brush from the body shop it's
their face no their body brush sorry
get it together Jordan get it together
so I love this brush because as you can
see it covers such a wide area so
quickly so I'm just putting down a rough
base color at first to begin with and
then I'm gonna turn the brush on its
side and start creating a line so I'm
really dipping in the product and
creating a dark heart lines and in
between the lines I'm gonna leave gaps
just so we create that sort of like
clown neck piece that you see and why I
like the fact that it's a loose pigment
as you can see I'm starting to flick
some of the product on my body just so
the rest of my body doesn't look super
clean time before the little fake arose
tattoos so I start by drawing like a
little circle and then around that
circle you just start doing little
Wiggly shapes and join them up as you go
along kind of see what I'm doing I will
speed for it because it is the same
process but yeah just start doing little
Wiggly shapes making the petals as you
go along it's you finally end up with
something that looks a little bit like
this and then repeat the same thing
above it sometimes the best thing to do
is actually of a reference picture of a
rose in front of you
that way it can kind of you know you
have some it's a copy off of that's what
I did anyway because my imagination is
not that good
I went off camera and did the same thing
on the other side just you know save you
some boredom and now I'm not taking the
black eye shadow on that double-ended
brush on the angled side and I start
shading in at the Roses just to create
more realism and make it look more
tattoo like you just want to make sure
you have darker bits and lighter bits to
really create the death best thing to do
is add the shadows underneath the pale
so you know if the petals were
overlapping each other
that's where to aim to put the shadowing
if that makes sense does that make sense
I don't know like hopefully you can just
kind of see what I'm doing my
explanations are just oh great not gonna
lie this well you need some patience for
this it is a bit time-consuming but it's
so worth it in the end this totally adds
so much to the roses it like brings it
together finishes it off so definitely
worth it once we've been shading in the
roses for about three years I'm gonna
start shading around the roses this is
gonna kind of make it look like it's
popping out of our skin that's kind of
more like free deenis if you feel me
free deenis is our word I don't even
know but okay finishing touches and then
we are done so back in with the fake
blood I'm gonna smear that all over my
fingers just like this and then I'm
gonna do sort of like drag my hand
across my chest kinda make a little egg
there's been a bit of a struggle or
something keep playing around with it to
get it exactly how I want it to look and
then any excess blood I've got on my
hand I'm just gonna put it over the rest
of my body and then lastly I'm gonna
apply a week a bandana and then this
look is complete so I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video I had so much
fun filming it and thank you to the body
shop for teaming up with me for this and
