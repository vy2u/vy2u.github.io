just so much toilet paper hey guys it's
Jordan so today's video includes toilet
paper no I know crazy right bye promise
there is an idea behind it like don't to
tell yet basically I'm going to be
trying to curl my hair using bits of
toilet paper honestly I have no idea how
this is going to go I've just scrolling
through Pinterest you know as you do but
let me tell you some crazy
yes illness and we saw this girl curling
her hair was 12 people and I was like
okay hit me I was like that's the staff
video I did oh my god I don't even know
I'm doing it on but apparently this
actually works so I mean I cannot get to
know China right there Tommy I'm just
saying holding a freaking lure okay so
let's do this look online
I'm actually pretty intrigued even if
this works this could be like cheapest
most accessible way to curl your hair
about using any eight like we all have
toilet paper right I mean if we don't
I'm worried for you right let's go let's
go so I'm signing off with freshly
washed hair I think your messages on
damp air mine's like pretty much dry now
so I now have to go grab a spray ball
and fix it right
couldn't find a spray ball guys but I've
got a bowl of water and a brush no idea
where my logic was at this but I'm just
using what I've got hands we are making
do okay so from one thing she's actually
grabbing a chunk of hair spraying it
roughing out with the toilet paper and
that is honestly I think I'm going to
section off my hair otherwise I'm gonna
be a hot mess I know it but you're just
going to put my hair in half put it in a
little burning little burn okay sink
sink I got tip pen
Hegel's you need to rip off a summer loo
roll I'm going to go longer than what
she did because all I want it to be
quite sick the toilet paper so maybe
like that much I don't even know you can
make it as thick as you want I'm going
to a double mine up because I don't wait
to break when I tie it so I feel like
this is gonna be stronger just folding
it in half like that and then basically
you're meant to fold it again like links
ways make it thinner so basically how
you make the little
toilet paper curly thingamabob ease and
then take a section of hair something
like that obviously depending on how
much hair you take will depend on how
your curls come out so the smaller the
tights are the big other looser I don't
even know anyone just for a bit they see
me rollin in stated got my water just
gonna jump in my hair with a brush I'm
painting water on my hair waters boats
then and once you've done that you take
a bit all that toilet paper and you roll
you roll the ends around the paper first
and then you basically roll up high so
that ice bear we're just we're wrapping
around it and then you just tie it in a
knot it meant to hang like that I what
is that I'm doing that one again didn't
like it didn't like it oh oh I've got 20
pounds like my hair oh my gosh thought I
ripped out my hair I'm going to wrap the
ends round then wrap up and then you
want to tie these together in a knot
please look hey I'm going to do one more
with you guys member the time that's the
rest but what I'm going to do is much in
a time on my phone how long it takes me
to do my whole head just you guys get an
idea about how time consuming it is or
not you know painting some water on my
hair wrap the end roll up oh I've got
some toilet paper just chilling on me
she didn't and then just tighten up oh
yes be careful because obviously it is
blue roll so it can break easily look at
that one look I'm going to look great
after this with it's a loo roll in my
house pretty much what you do so I'm
going to go ahead do it all speed out a
few guys and catch up with you in a sec
once I've done my whole head
I don't know with you guys can see that
but it took me at 15 minutes and 23
seconds to do my entire head which to be
honest I do a pretty good going
considering of them at summers before
and you really have to get into the
swing of things and get used to it
I felt else a good time and obviously
the more you do it the quick you'd get
at it so I want to see so that was
pretty good like click on you will look
at myself right now I can't fit myself
there as latest what am i doing fella
this is an improvement Smith finished
Alec did a substract so all the
centimeter do now is actually go to bed
and in the morning we're going to see
will my hair other things I do want to
mention though about it first thing is
you don't want to make your hair too
excellency is toilet paper so it does
rip really easily if your hair is too
wet so now that in mind also I have to
tie a couple of lastic bands around a
few of them because sometimes you can't
get it reads like something just want to
profile and I did also make up a bunch
of the toilet paper like roll things
because it just makes it so much easier
to grab you know by a deal science I'm
off to that I will catch up with you
guys in the morning take me down with
see if there's cover here fingers of
course
hello again I'm back so it is the next
morning looking a little bit different I
just woke up through my face on so I
have to admit it was actually really
comfortable to sleep on it it's just
tissue though and off your tissue is
it's quite squishy so that was fine and
as you can see some of them has it drops
but I don't think that's going to affect
the way that the car comes out
whatsoever because by the time I've
woken up I'm pretty sure they had
already set anyway they set super fast
so not worried at all so I will say I
don't think it actually has to sleep on
these girls because one of mine so
about like an hour and a half two hours
in so having them on my head how to
really go so I mean is tailored to you
whatever works for you let's go ahead
and undo let's see what's going on see
that you could take out since I got
another one so let me get two stuck in
my hair which is up oh my God look at
that okay it is a hundred percent cold
my hair because it's just like bouncing
I'm going to go ahead and take one of
these that I have real quick and then
we'll see we'll see what happened okay
so this is how my hair has come out um I
mean it's definitely cold not really my
kind of style at all colors are a little
like crazy as well like they're not
curls and unlike kinks and like
genuinely like something from the olden
days if I get that cute isn't up to you
though yes you look at that that is so
much better okay it looks so much better
up right like the curls themselves are
like really really tight and some of
them really are like kinked so they look
a little strange when they're down it
just looks like a let's go on there so
I'm going to be honest I don't I'm not
feeling it I mean up inexcus-- I mean it
worked
so get me wrong like my hair was curly
curly - occupied layered up the toilet
paper so there were bigger sections and
I took bigger chunks of hair the words
look way better because they would have
been looser and way less like krei you
know the kind of I want to give up on it
yet you know what I think I watch my run
some water through it to loosen them up
and see how that works
yeah that's going to go the poor war is
that guy's just a 26-6 this situation
right now I'm just literally running
water through my hair of my fingers to
try that calm some of it down I like
running all other is definitely helped a
little bit but honestly still
oh she's a frizzy mess but I'll be using
this method again to comb my hair
absolutely not purpose of this was I was
meant to just wake up take them out and
be done but I have to do so much work -
and it still looks like some of my hair
is curly some of it's just not a Millard
way but up honestly this was a fail like
I just didn't personally like it I mean
it's not the worst thing ever but the
whole purpose of it was meant to be
quick like takeout go you know what it's
