is going to be a kind of DIY slash hack
video and there's going to be a bit of
room to call a little bit of beauty a
bit of organization that's just a bit of
everything I personally love watching
these kind of videos so I really wanted
to make one for my channel and I just
want to share with you guys some of my
favorite kind of hacks and things so
also a huge shout out to my mum so
helping me with this video because this
was not easy to throw Mew like behind
the scenes you guys would be like oh
wait before this video does anybody
don't forget to subscribe to my channel
while you're here and then that way you
guys can keep up to date with me anyway
let's jump straight into the video I
hope you guys like it
so the first thing I have to show you
guys is this diamond choker these have
been ever at the moment this is super
affordable really easy and it looks
really pretty so all you're going to
need is a diamond border you can get
this at any craft store it comes in so
many different colors and it was only a
couple of pounds and then you're going
to want an old necklace that you no
longer use because we will be kind off
the chain part here and also the hook so
the first thing you want to do is take
that diamond border wrap it roughly
around your neck and with your finger
just mark off where the kind of the
material meets and then you want to take
some scissors and just cut at that point
where it met and as you guys will be
able to see the choker is already coming
to life and then you want to take some
scissors and chop off the chain and hook
part of the necklace my necklace was
kind of weak so I could do this but if
you do have a stronger necklace you
might need to use some pliers to do this
and then you want a hot glue gun knees
to the back of the choker the easiest
way I found to do this was to add some
glue then put the pot on and secure it
with even more glue so you know that
it's not going to come apart and as you
guys can see when I turn it over you
can't see the glue at all because of
glue dries clear so it's perfect and
that is it you guys you just tie it up
at the back and you have your perfect
little diamond choker like I said this
comes in so many different colors I
actually have a rose gold one of this as
well and I love it
I'm going to now show you guys how you
commit your very own makeup brush
cleaner board at home so all you're
going to need is a clipboard
I just cut mine in half with a craft
knife you're also going to need a hot
glue gun but I mean just be careful
because it's hot so just to show you
guys this is the Sigma one and it has a
bunch of like dots and lines and
squiggles on it so you're basically
going to want to mimic that onto your
own board so using the hot glue gun I'm
just going to create a bunch of squiggly
lines dots straight line zigzags
whatever you like be creative and just
so you're aware as well this isn't going
to be like the neatest thing in the
world you are using glue so it can get a
little bit messy but don't worry this is
DIY so just be creative
so you can go ahead and create as many
it designs as you like just have fun
with it but I new went up halfway for
the video and I'm just using a craft
knife to cut it in half and as you can
see you have your own little board and
just to show you guys how it works I'm
using a makeup brush here to clean and
you can see the dirt really coming off
the bumps really help to get into the
bristles
honestly this works just as good as my
Sigma one a fraction of the price the
clip board was like a pound and I mean
hot glue guns are useful to have but
they're only a few pounds anyway so this
is perfect so this next one goes along
with the last one this is to help dry
your brushes however this is so simple
but it's so genius so all you're going
to need is some elastic bands of course
your wet makeup brushes and a pole or
rail to hang them from so all you're
going to do is take the elastic band
over the top of the brush round the back
of the rail and then back over the brush
at the bottom just to hook it onto the
rail now this is going to help your
brushes to dry in its form so it doesn't
miss shape or anything like that because
sometimes when you lay them down they
can get on misshapen and it's so
annoying and this also helps to drain
any excess product from the brushes so
simple right but this is one of the best
inventions ever
so this next one is a storage idea this
is so simple again but this is hold your
makeup palettes so all you're going to
need is some little toast rails here and
of course some of your favorite pallets
to put on display and you literally just
fill them up that is it you guys this
only holds kind of thinner and smaller
palette so see if you have chunky ones
you might prefer this option which is I
kind of washing-up rail you know the
things you put your cutlery in in your
plates to kind of drain through and this
fits any size pallet because the gaps
are big enough it literally for all of
my pallets in which I love and it's nice
to put some out on display not only that
but for my people out there with alec
straws this fits perfectly on the top of
them it's amazing this one is another
really simple yet affordable one like
all of them but this is a way to display
your little beauty sponges show all
you're going to need is some egg cup
holders I like these ones because
they're spiral so the air can get
actually get to them for them to dry and
then you can of course enjoy sponges and
you just pop them in and you can display
these anywhere in your room and you can
be really fun and inventive with
different colors and it just think it
looks cool have you guys ever wondered
what you could do with empty food cans
and containers well I'm about to show
you sort of course you're getting some
cans some spray if you want to visit
option we've got mine from a craft store
and some gloves to protect your hands
so all that I'm doing is spraying the
cans with this kind of gold copper color
you can use whichever color that you
would like and the best way to spray
these I found was in kind of short
bursts just so you get a nice thin layer
on there and they dry a lot quicker also
I forgot to say if you're struggling to
get the stickers off from around the
cans like the labels use peanut butter
it really does work to help get the
residue off and the stickiness so
I'm going to tell my cans in to makeup
brush holders so I'm just using these
little decorative crystals that I got
from a craft store just the brushes have
somewhere to kind of stand when they go
in and I'm just popping the makeup
brushes inside it is that simple and
that easy
and there you go guys how pretty it does
that look I'm also going to show you
guys how to create the flowers that I
stood next to the jars here this is an
empty glass food container this was a
pound so instead of buying of ours you
could literally use an empty food
container so all you're going to need is
more of this diamond border this is like
a rose gold II pinky one I love again
this was a couple of pounds from a craft
store and I'm just cutting off the size
that wraps you know fits around the
bottle and with some tape I'm going to
take this on you can use glue if you
like I like tape because you can
actually then go ahead and switch out
the colors if you like just get creative
and I just put some paper into the
bottle here and I'm just adding these
little black crystal bead things from
Ikea these were a couple of pounds and
I'm just filling up the bottom so it's
kind of a place for the flowers to sit
into
and then you can of course go ahead and
pop in any flowers that you like mine
are fake flowers which I think these are
so much better and easier because well
you haven't got worry about looking
after them you can just put them in and
that is ear
so that is it for this video I hope that
