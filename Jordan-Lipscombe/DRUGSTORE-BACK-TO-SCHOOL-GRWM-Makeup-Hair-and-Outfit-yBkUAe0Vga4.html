easy makeup look was still super put
together because let's be real we all
slept in way too late and only have a
little bit of time to get ready so I'm
gonna be taking the maybelline baby skin
primer and just push this into the areas
where my pores are more visible then I'm
going to color correct my under-eye
circles because they are pretty intense
right now so I'm going to take the la
girl pro conceal in the orange shade and
just Pat that underneath my eyes and
then blend out further with a little
sponge now looks crazy right now but I
promise this guy is an absolute Savior
then for my foundation I'm going to be
taking L'Oreal True Match this is one of
my faves and I'm just going to dot this
all over my skin and blend that out with
a sponge I love this foundation because
it's super lightweight but it's got
really good coverage as well and it's
just quick and easy to just put on my
skin
then just to make sure that everything
is concealed underneath my eyes I'm
taking another la girl Pro conceal but
this is in the color porcelain and I'm
just putting that everywhere so
underneath my eyes and then highlight
the rest of my face so the bridge of my
nose Cupid's bow chin and forehead and
then just taking the little baby sponge
again and just blend that all in
working to bake my face to make sure it
lasts all day through whatever we're
doing at school I'm using the RCM a no
color powder I'm just packing on
underneath my eyes and then also under
the places that I have what would
contour this is going to give the
illusion that we have contoured when
really we haven't so we save a step
then of course you set the rest of my
face using the NYX HD finishing powder
then once that's been on there for a
couple minutes I'm just going to dust
away all of the excess powder do bronze
up the skin I'm taking this NYX and it's
one of those sort of pro singles the
contour ones and this is in the color
tan and I'm just of course going to put
this around the perimeter of my face to
warm up the skins with it a little bit
more healthy this is the makeup
revolution rose gold highlighter I use
it as a blush it is so pretty it just
adds a glow to your cheeks and as a base
for a highlighter and give it something
to stick to I'm taking the natural
collection kind of stick cream
highlighter in rose glow and I'm just
packing this on my cheekbones just going
to blend that in a little bit more with
my sponge and then taking my color pop
highlighting spoon as you can see it's
broken this stuff is amazing I'm just
going to go over the top or where I put
that natural collection one and then
also highlight my nose and my Cupid's
bow as well this is just going to give
our skin at that super healthy and dewy
glow
then I'm just shaking what am i makeup
revolution chocolate bar palettes don't
look at it it's all broken and gray
whose I'm going to take the orange shade
on a fluffy blending brush and just
whack back in the creases it's just
going to be so super easy and quick
because we didn't have time in the
morning so
and then I'm taking that sort of rosy
coppery color and just using my finger
to pack that on all over the lids and
just build it up until I've got the
intensity that I want
rocki
I'm then just popping some of that color
pop highlighter in the inner corners and
I'm taking the Rimmel nude pencil and
I'm just popping this in my waterline
just to give my eyes more of an awake
kind of feel for mascara I'm taking the
L'Oreal voluminous lashes the Fatah won
this is new and it is so so good I'm
just going to give my lashes a generous
coat of this we're not doing any liner
or anything like that we just want to
keep it really easy
for my bottom lashes I'm just taking
this collection color lash mascara in
brown I find that Brown is way it's
softer than black on the lower lash line
so it's just a little bit more subtle
to align my lips I'm using this NYX
retractable lip liner in the color nude
and once I've lined them I'm just going
to blend that in with my finger just so
the lipstick that I use blends
seamlessly with the lip liner
for my lipstick I'm taking the NYX
lingerie liquid lipstick in the color
lace detail I'm using a liquid lipstick
because I find it they last all days
they'll be less touching up during
school and the color of these lingerie
lipsticks
are incredible
I'm just popping a new gloss in the
center of my lips you can keep it matte
but I just wanted to add a little bit of
a gloss so that is the finished makeup
look it takes you ten minutes but let's
be real you are ready to slay the day
now I don't know about you guys but I
just never know what to do of my hair in
the mornings it's a mess and I never
know how to do it so I have a quick and
easy hairstyle for you that looks like
you spent longer on it than you did in
my opinion so all I'm doing is
sectioning off the top layer and I'm
just gonna straighten my hair
now I have a fringe that all that I'm
doing is section off the kind of top
portion of hair because we're going to
be putting it in a little ponytail if
you don't have a friend you can still do
this just obviously pop it all up but
all that I'm doing with my fringe is
just taking little pieces and putting it
back in the ponytail just so the front
of my hair looks a little bit more PC
and then of course I'm just going to tie
it up so we have a little ponytail on
the top I'm just going to kind of go
back and forth in between tightening the
ponytail pulling bits out to make it
looser just basically make it look
however you want it to for my fringe I
just take my straightener again and just
of curl bits back just so I can get my
fringe sitting how I want it to
and that is his hairstyle complete it
looks so cute
but it's super effortless so you really
don't have to spend a lot of time doing
it
and now we are ready to get into our
outfit for the day so this is the outfit
that I went for my little choker
necklace is from forever 21 my top is
also from forever 21 my jeans are from a
Tesco my trainers are all white night
theer's and my little rucksack is from
Primark so that concludes this video I
hope you guys enjoyed if you did hit
that thumbs up button be sure to be
following me on all my social medias I
love you guys and I'll see you all in my
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
