this prom makeup look for you guys it's
just a comment I do have on a new layer
bottom I just show you a couple of
different options in case you fill in
something a little bit different I think
my personal favorite with the eyes is
the nude lip just because I think it's
really girly and pretty yeah
I mean if you don't know prom it like me
mine was like I was like like three or
four years ago now without when did I
actually grow up you can still rock this
if you're feeling a little bit extra and
you want to you know throw some glitter
on your eyes quickly so before I do my
makeup actually did a skincare step
because for prom you want your makeup to
look like really good right and skin
prep is to keep transfer if I use one of
my favorite masks ever this is the body
shop British roads fresh plumping left
this actually ties in perfectly because
I do have some body shop stuff to tell
these eyes in a sec it's called I
promise so just pop this all over my
skin at left its like 10 at 15 minutes
washed off and my skin was ready for
makeup so onto the juicy stuff that has
to tell you guys throw on a big fan of
this mask range these were a favorite
fear of my last year so it's so cool
that I had the amazing opportunity to
team up with the body shops to just
represent something that I love how I
teamed up with them is I did a photo
shoot with them it was me and four other
girls the other girls were Lela Rose
coastal Helen Anderson and Tasha green
lovely girls by the way these photos are
going to be installed in displays or
body shots so if you are one you might
see my face if you do see me take a
picture with it and tag me on my socials
because I love to know like whereabouts
I am see how five marks five of us girls
will all represent in our favorite one
my personal favorite is the British rose
one because it honestly leaves my skin
so plump
so rejuvenated it's honestly just a fab
mask what's really cool as well as it
will suit all different skin types so
it's just an all-rounder it's an
all-round bru mask and suppose I want to
see my skin off using this is just so
like you know the others laughing out
the toe is a little bit of info see you
guys Amanda guys are going to have a
group meetup on the 3rd of May in the
London
Westfield Stratford body shops store and
it's going to be between 6 &amp;amp; 8 p.m. I
will leave this all in the description
box below so you don't actually have to
remember you are walking around and do
come say hey honestly feel free because
me in the girls would love to meet you
you don't need to ticket this lip line
online or anything it's super casual so
yeah if you do want to come say hey
something right right so I'm pretty sure
that's everything else to update you
guys on so now on to this makeup look if
you do want to know how I get this and
it just keep watching
I just taking off that mask hopefully
you guys can see my like glowing and
fresh my skin is looking and it feels so
good as I was hanging on to make up
we're going to of course start by
priming our skin because what I like up
to look as good as possible lasts for as
long as possible we don't want you know
and they come out in off a faceoff with
you tonight this is the boy shop all in
one instant primer now I like this
because this is that kind of like
smoothing pore filling kind of situation
which I'm about to go back on a silicone
feel to it I'm just going to take this
onto my tears on my nose little bit my
forehead you know just this this color
this kind of area I'm really kind of
pressing right in because these fools
don't mess about
they don't play they're they're their
ticket to this I'm good
for foundation I'm going in with one of
my faves this is the ella go pro
coverage foundation if you've been on my
channel a while you know how much I love
L'Oreal True Match as well but you need
this one today because this is actually
HD high definition we want to locate the
Emma so if you're wondering one is in
the color nude beige just using a real
techniques sponge because I feel like
these are the easiest to get the most
natural finish as well boy life but its
foundations it's got really nice
coverage so you're going to cover what
you need to but it's super lightweight
so I don't feel like I'm wearing
anything I want to see the worst thing
everyone you can fill makeup on your
face I'm like can just not please this
was a really nice finish as well so your
skin is going to look glowy this
foundation is so bold look for the prize
yes just kind of course drag it down my
neck a little because you know what I'm
much not a match
so we're going to conceal this under eye
circles because you know the night
before we didn't sleep so excited maybe
a little bit nervous
another good though this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer this is my
say that drugstore concealer because it
just melts into the skin but it gives
that coverage that you need it just is
perfect for me anyway I think for prom
you need those products that provide
that coverage but look like skin
you know because we want to be looking
like we've got on a mask taking our
booty blender again or my Real
Techniques buns but I mean close enough
gonna blend this are this concealer is
quite like liquidy so it's so easy to
blend out I'm just like so I'm just
going to top over my whole face now to
make sure we're really blended because
that we're going to set this in place
Rimmel stay matte because you know we
want to be so much we don't have me
looking crazy just taking the back of a
makeup brush and just scrape out the top
layer because it actually makes a really
nice powder to bake we're going to
practice on underneath our eyes just
going to bake with this just cook a
whole face I'm just using this to set my
face as well
afters have been on like a minute or so
I'm just going to just get away we know
that we look reading back right now but
I think it's super important to have a
really set base and then we can add the
glow back with highlighter because I
makeup will last so much longer that way
you know take my NYX and matte bronzer
to warm up my complexion I love this
bronzer as well because it's matte which
i think is the most flattering it's so
hard in the drugstore I think to find
matte bronzer so that's why this is like
my fave such this forehead you know some
for my baby heads getting in the way get
out there you have to be too precise
with this on its you're just soca'
sitting around kind of the perimeter of
my moon thing just going to contour it
wet skip my face a little bit of shape
this would be a makeup keep makeup geek
makeup geek complicated cool medium
contour like
pan and I'm taking my girl farmer I
share them with a teeny amount because
this stuff is pigmented AF we're going
to go in on the cheekbone here the side
brush I find is the easiest because you
can kind of get that definition
straight away I mean I don't have
cheekbones that I can pretend right
anyway blusher in the color cupcake oh
my god why that's so cute it's just it's
really pretty soft pink color I love
colors like this because I think they
just go is like any makeup look
these Emery blush is only a pound as
well like it's so good is it I don't
think you can go wrong with these sleek
highlight and palettes I have the
softest one as well this one is to
Cleopatra one which has more of those
like golden bronty tones
living for it I'm going to mix the two
part of shades together the globe is
that can you sleep palette has to be one
of the best drugstore highlighters hands
down like on the floor touching the
ground
lightly pat on top with a sponge to make
sure that the highlight has no obvious
like limes correct I'm one below me
again one side open so we are all close
and personal things you guys in a little
bit I'm about to do the eyes so pretty
I'm sure I'm going to be taking a couple
of shades from this NYX and fab on
shadow palette this is so pretty like
this is the plastic neutral I should
have had it I'm going to start by taking
this like white shake here which is
called Cleopatra and I'm just going to
set my lips with this I'm not going into
this like orangey shake here called
suede I'm just going to start kind of
buffing this into and above the crease
just to create some sort of transition
like check out how pigmented these
eyeshadows are though some say they
blend up super effortlessly as well
which is cool because you know you don't
have to be the best at makeup to be able
to use them I mean hey if I can do it
you guys can do it it's a deeper crease
layer but I'm going to take this color
right here called nirvana I'm focusing
this color way more into the crease I'm
not taking up as high as I did that
suede color just going back and forth on
my crease like this and you know
windshield wiper motions I don't reckon
it to spread too fast so this is going
to keep it right where I want it now for
the fun part the glitter so this is big
great in that I'm using this is the LA
splashed crystallized glitter in angels
tip I'm just taking some quickly this
one's the next one and I'll just turn
that all over my lid take in the canal
then I'm just going to start packing on
the glitter
just taking some a darker color that we
used in the crew Segen i'll just ever so
slightly going around the glitter here
just to really deepen the crease I'm
just going to go ahead now do the exact
same thing to is I so I'm going to be
applying a full flashes so I'm just
taking this remote volume shake mascara
and just quickly coating my lashes I'm
just doing this so that my eyelashes
don't look like white against the
pussies these are the lashes that I'm
going to use these are the Eyler luxe
ocular lashes they're mink of sight
lashes which is really cool mink effect
I can talk sore eyes I can mess it up
this is what they look like just really
wispy along I chose these ones because I
didn't want anything like to stick and
voluminous because I wanted to keep it
really pretty and like you know so I
wanted more kind of like wispy nurse and
length so twinsies also they have a nice
thin band so they should be easy to
apply
the last thing to do now is ellipse so I
purposely want the neutral colors on the
eye so that you guys can pair it with
whatever lip color you want whatever you
feel comfortable with I think I would
look really cool as well as if you paid
your lip color with your dress color so
if your is very like a red dress you
wore a red lips that would look hot I'm
going to show you guys a couple of
different lip colors so you can visually
see it with this eye look but yeah
totally up to you
let's do this so here is a nude option I
think this is my personal fave because
you guys know another going to just nude
lipstick not anything else think this is
the body shop matte liquid lipstick in
color at Windsor Rose it's just a really
pretty like brownie beige nude so here
is a red lip option this why I think
looks so good as well with the color of
the glitter on the eyes I think it's
Heidi and really nicely this is the NYX
soft matte lip cream in Barcelona
whenever i heerd web barcelona it makes
me think about insurance on like anyone
else eh is that classic statement pillar
box red color it also makes my teeth
look like yeah this is one looks up with
a red lip or if you're feeling like
letting your inner vamp come through
there's this option as well I love this
one but I love a good like dark lip this
is another one of the body shop liquid
lipsticks in the color Mauritius Dahlia
just an amazing dark purple like a bit
of a barrier to discolor or you could
wear like a classic pink lip perfectly
myself I never wear colors like this
with Ronis you think they suit me but
I'm going to show you guys what it look
like and it's cute it's just a nice cool
toned pink actually think it makes to
quit on my eyes stand out quite a lot
