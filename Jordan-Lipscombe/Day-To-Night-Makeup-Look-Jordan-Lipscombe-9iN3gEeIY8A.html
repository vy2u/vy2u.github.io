primed I'm gonna move straight on to
foundation I'm using one of my favorites
L'Oreal True Match and like I normally
do I'm just going to dot this all over
my skin and blend it in with my Real
Techniques sponge
you'll probably be able to notice adding
quite blend my foundation although out
to my hairline but I promise as I put
more makeup on that does go so moving on
to concealer I'm using Mac Pro Longwear
in NC 20 and I'm just going to put that
underneath my eyes down the center of my
nose Cupid's bow chin and the middle of
my forehead to set the concealer I'm
just going to be taking the collection
shelley's powder in translucent and I'm
just going to pack that on underneath my
eyes and then for my brows I'm using the
NYX eyebrow gel in chocolate this stuff
is my new favorite you guys it doesn't
budge all day it's waterproof and it
literally sets in your eyebrows it's so
good I'm just going to quickly go
through my brows about if you do want
any more in-depth brow tutorial let me
know
and then to dust away all of that powder
underneath my eyes now for the eyes i'm
taking this nyx single eye shadow in the
shade is just like a burnt orange color
and I'm just messing putting this all
over the lid into the crease this is
just a really quick and easy eyeshadow
look I'm also taking at that same orange
shadow and just buffing that underneath
my eyes to complete the look this is
just me showing you that I put this
Rimmel nude pencil in my waterline to
open up my eyes after I've curled my
lashes I'm going in with mascara I'm
using the l'oreal miss hippie mascara
and i'm just putting a generous coat all
over my lashes i do really like this
mascara it really just lengthens my
lashes and kind of adds a bit of volume
at the same time
and then of course I'm going to put some
mascara on my bottom lashes as well now
I'm going to jump straight back to the
face I'm taking this chocolate heaven
bronzed up by makeup revolution and I'm
just going to put this just on the
perimeter of my face to really warm up
the skin and also just to add a little
bit of shape as well I'm just using a
little bit of matte give me Sun because
I can't help myself full blush I'm
taking the Sigma one in the color born -
and I'm just going to pop this on the
apples of my cheeks just to add a little
bit of color for highlight on my
favorite part I'm going to be taking the
Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kit in
sunkissed I'm taking just a mixture of
summer and tourmaline this is amazing
you guys I use this literally all the
time to complete this look on my lips
I'm taking the NYX liquid suede lipstick
in soft-spoken I love this color you
guys in fact the combination that I'm
doing in this video I've been wearing
all the time
I love the formula of these as well
they're so comfortable to wear and they
last a really long time and just to make
it a little bit lighter I'm just popping
a bit of concealer on over the top and
then I put some translucent powder on as
well just to really mattify it and this
is the completed day look I've been
wearing this makeup look non-stop but
now we're going to turn it into a more
nighttime appropriate look so I'm just
going to be taking some of that same
collection translucent powder and we're
just going to Pat away all them oils I'm
sure we would have after a long day all
that this makeup look is is just adding
on top of what we already have so it's
super easy now to add a bit more shape
we're going to contour I'm taking these
sleek contour kit and medium and we're
just gonna carve out our cheekbones a
little bit more well I'm gonna do as
best of a job as I can because I have a
movie so
taking a combat I'm just going to gently
remove that nude liner that we put in
earlier because I will be replacing it
with a darker one later on now I'm
taking the makeup revolution naked
chocolate palette and I'm taking this
kind of movie purple color and I'm just
going to work that into the crease I
kind of am going to transform this look
into more of like a pinky movie purple
look going back in I'm taking these kind
of light up kinky purple colors and I'm
going to just pack these on all over the
lid this is just me showing you that I
put some brown liner in my waterline now
all I'm doing is taking any black
eyeshadow and I'm going to focus this as
close to my lower lash line as possible
and we're going to go in with a kind of
light chocolatey brown color and just
start buffing that black out just so it
doesn't look as harsh and everything
looks a lot softer and then all that I'm
doing is taking a fluffy brush and
really just diffusing that color so
everything is really blended I then
decided that it wasn't dark enough so I
just went in with that warm chocolate
brown color again and just put it right
into the crease to complete the eyes I'm
going to go in with some lashes of
course it wouldn't be complete without
them so I'm going to be wearing these
Shirley style ones from classy lashes
they're perfect because they're kind of
long bit flirty and wispy I think
they're perfect for a night look
I'm then going in with an extra coat
often scar on my bottom lashes just to
make them stand out a little bit more
now you could totally leave this lip
color it goes perfectly but I'm going to
switch it up so I'm going to be taking a
max well lipstick it's just kind of like
a dark movie purpley color I think it
goes perfectly with the eyes and that is
it for this nighttime look I hope that
you guys liked it as you can see it's
just a quick and easy way to transform
your makeup look if you did enjoy please
give a big thumbs up subscribe if you
aren't already I love you guys and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
