going to be super chilled I'm just going
to do my hair and makeup with you guys
just at all you know get ready with me
let's do the hair and makeup that I had
in my last video which you guys went
crazy for you really wanted to see this
so I'm doing it I was really surprised
too because the makeup was really really
simple there's no lashes the main focus
of it is just like the really really
glowy skin which is my favorite is kind
of makeup is my favorite love it love it
love love it and then my hair was just
like these wavy curls you know what I
think we're gonna tie my hair because
it's gonna annoy the crap outta me okay
that is so much better I'm going to use
V Nichols app Primark water but here's
just a couple times but it feels really
nice on my skin anything about this
though is the like spray it comes out
like a whole is like no joke massive
water droplets come out and I almost
like drown every time I use it I feel
like my face is dripping my hair is like
trench to where the water droplets are
like so big does I say this way that my
skin and just sort of sort the pores out
I'm going to use my good old benefit
professional I love this stuff honestly
makes the nicest base for my makeup just
gonna rub this into my t-zone guys I've
been like really ill at the moment a
concert coffee nice keep taking coffee
breaks in this video because I'm like
dying
oh my god by the way guys I have already
done that my eyebrows you probably
already knew that but I used the where
are you where are you I use the freedom
eyedropper made in a medium brown I
always do say I just did it because I
thought like this video is going to be
20 years long and your hair so seven
times in full foundation I used the
L'Oreal True Match now you guys know I
love this stuff took a break from using
it because I have so many foundations
that just wanted to try out different
things but honestly this is this off my
heart now right now this is a fresh time
so I mixed together the colors 4w and
6.5 w when my palate isn't so fresh I
just use 4 w bar come out so you getting
one your favorite foundation start to
run out
stop this onto my skin so recently I've
been starting with a brush to buff in my
foundation and then I've been using a
sponge afterwards just to get it really
like seamless this brush is the spectrum
b01 brush and honestly these are slower
soft I've only recently started using
these and they are so soft these I'm
your backstage Beauty ones which you'll
see later on in the video look like this
stop don't get me wrong I still love the
morphe brushes but switch it up well I'm
getting it in my hair I believe you guys
can see but this foundation has such a
nice finish it just looks like skin such
a nice like dewy satiny finish I love it
I have a little friend on my forehead at
the moment like why are you here I
didn't invite you first brush is amazing
at blending up the foundation but like I
said I always go in with a sponge
afterwards just to really make
everything look seamless and don't you
just love a brand-new sponge I just
realized it will go at this now and back
see how this bunch is the real
techniques 1 I do love this so good I
love this concealer this is the NARS
radiant creamy concealer it's a little
bit like the members of so town but will
work with it all and also an amazing
dupes Adair's I've got it here I'm
prepared this is the Maybelline fit me
concealer honestly the same thing
there are identical I like my face as
well cover up that big I'll Jeff on my
forehead too so I blend up victim CLO
with the sponge and then this is what I
mean by going over my foundation I'll
switch it round and blend the foundation
into the concealer as well a sponge I
think is honestly the best about
foundation and concealer just makes
everything melt into the skin yeah go
with the flat side and just beat my face
now even though I want this slippery
glowy and chewy I have all your skin so
I always set my face if I like it just
makes my foundation longer anyway
obviously if you have dry skin you can
skip these parts but we're just getting
ready with me you know to set my under
eyes I love the makeup revolution luxury
banana powder I love this one because
honestly it's not too yellow it doesn't
look really menthol underneath my eyes
and I'm using a backstage
contour flush blush scopes are I just
like it fits
Queen under here see can you guys see
that it's kept the brightness but it's
not yellow there's not a yellow cost
I appreciate this powder put it
underneath too powerful then de sitter
of my face I use a 22 amount of the soap
&amp;amp; Glory kick-ass instant retouched
pressed powder every time I read
kick-ass just want to be like kick-ass
you know enemy okay she's the brush is
the backstage are gold at powder brush
so just take a DD amount and said my
face I just do this and we're going to
let stuff then so much better once my
skin tada we've done with you thank you
now we don't make this super sunkissed
oh my god
the itch is known in the world NYX matte
bronzer in deep tan looks something like
this and then I'm using a more ve4 brush
to blend out honestly my favorite
bronzer brush ever forms the brush
that's a tongue twister I say that ten
times versus just a perfect size if it's
on my cheek perfectly yes honestly when
I put bronze on I'm like that's so much
better
teeny bit on the nose honestly I just
like taking a little bit of bronze on
the tip your nose makes it look like a
natural turn this blush smells on a real
I'm real smells like I'm on holiday by
the pool pina colada in my hand just on
babe in Chile em that's it this is the
benefit California blush it's the
perfect car lights up peachy golden
shade taking it on a spectrum either a 5
brush put it on the teeth it's so pretty
I never with a blush go into I founder
this because it's such a perfect shade
oh my god you realize I'm like smiling
to myself when I do it like click on
extra AF with the same brush and going
over the top it with your soap &amp;amp; Glory
peach party like brush brush blush brick
thingy mobile bi don't you can do no
swelling all the colors and just pop it
on hopefully you guys can see this makes
my cheek look so glowy and because you
know we're going for that car we look
today
pop on 12 is already have color to the
skin which I like surface I've already
got blossom and stuff it just adds that
glow back into my skin which I'm here
for it I'm here for it we are now onto
the part that just makes this look just
makes it any toe complete cherry on top
these have the most intense glow ever
and I love it oh Jesus quickly I'm just
keep at some lip balm because my lips
are dry AF so one of them I've had for
longer and literally been wearing
non-stop and the other ones more nude
but I'm freakin obsessed this is one
I've had longer this is the annotation
here's Nicole core where I palette which
looks like this this is what I've been
wearing all my recent Instagram photos
so if you've been wondering what like
the Gores this purple this is amazing
just want to share it with you guys
because I was wearing it in my last
video but the one I'm going to use today
because I used socials the other day are
so I'm going to shoot deliver that and I
was like oh my god I need that in my
life
also had amazing things about this front
of highlighter because my friend Talia
uses it all the time so this is the row
for our blissful highlights are like
even in a pan were going to use a
spectrum at b06 brush it's just a little
eye shadow brush that sits perfectly on
my cheek because I'm so extra I like to
spray my face and then applied to make
it really really intense so this is the
urban decay D slick oil control setting
spray so a spring one side apply spray
over apply
the funny thing is as well though I'm
barely even going in and that you've
gone at this and applying it and it's
not pigmented so what's this I'm just
hitting all the high points of my face
I'm going to do above my eyebrows to
just happen over the top with my sponge
just to make sure there's no edges to
the highlighter look at my face it
actually looks wet a little for it
honestly if you love a frickin intense
highlighter where your skin looks wet
you need to sing your life hands the
eyes are so simple to oil it she did was
coat on some mascara my favorite of
course which is the Maybelline lash
sensational dr. Simpson
yes does add volume yes it's drugstore
even better it has come what eyelashes
search to really get them I just popped
the eyelash curler for a few seconds
don't go just go in and coat my lashes
with this I don't hold back you guys
know me you know I love myself some
false lashes even though my eyelashes
are quite long anyway I just feel like
false lashes complete any makeup look
but this mascara guy is like look at my
lashes I don't feel like I even need to
wear lashes I thought I've been really
into this fresh faced look recently I
want to see got mascara everywhere right
now I'm just popping some of my sonÃ­s
shoes as well okay I swear we all have
that mascara so just simple I don't say
but if you're wondering why my chest
looks quite shining it's because I took
some that same over a highlighter and
just bust it in like this I'll add a
little bit more cozy nice my off then on
my lips off man like a renewed lip color
another combo it was was the Nippon fab
matte liquid lipstick in the colour cool
news now this is like a beige e
brown color and these are new as well
and I've really been enjoying the
formula of these then over the top I go
in with the NYX soft matte lip cream in
London this just adds that a little bit
of like pink to the lip because this is
so cool tone so I just mixed them
together
you know because of my skin tone this
lip color on me looks really gray like
it doesn't really look like I have any
lips which is why I take this NYX soft
matte lip cream over the top it just
adds like a little bit more kind of
color to my lips I really like this
combo though it's really unique kind of
like am very cool toned Brown enews I
don't know I love it so this is the
makeup that I was wearing I have been
nothing I just think it looks really
fresh love the glow and I thought any of
you can do this it's so simple but now
I'm going to move on to the hair so this
is honestly so simple to do a lot easier
than you might think I'm pretty sure
that have done a really similar
hairstyle to this before my channel bit
was ages ago so kind of updated now so I
will show you again so just section off
the top layer of hair and the curly ones
I use is one that looks like this don't
judge my like cheetah print hair so such
as any card in one that kind of goes
that bigger to smaller like this so just
take a bit of hair pull the hair tool
down wrap my hair flap around it I leave
kind of the ends out on a hold it's like
four seconds and then let it go and then
as you can see Kenna Chrome I pretty
much just repeat this around my entire
head this kind of on just so hot so it
literally cause my hair so fast so the
key to the volume is you want to make
sure you do curls in opposite directions
so so I'm going away so I'm come into
water face this one I'm going to do now
towards my face
just like that obviously just go around
our rapido all over my house make sure
that you keep remembering to like
alternate the way the curls go size like
the most important thing take down the
top layer and then I just I kind of just
do the top layer kind of like randomly
so instead of parting it anywhere so
don't really want a part and I like the
hair that I can flip it in any direction
I want and it kind of falls like that
wrap a random section give it a curl
just like that and then go back in take
another random section and I'll probably
do this one and towards my face because
the other one was away
yeah just keep repeating that until I've
curled the whole top layer
I literally have ringlets right now now
they've cooled down I just go ahead and
run my fingers through my hair shake
just shake my hair about and then just
go in and like separate the curls myself
so I mean as you guys can see I don't
have to do much volume wise I mean why
do I have a cropped on a hair anyways -
because obviously the cows are quite
small so there's a lot of them and three
because of the way we cut them because
some ways some towards so our hair
doesn't like sit as one big curl it's
just really big and messy I don't do too
much out to where I take the bed head
Queen for a date chickens ready just
sort of flip my hair about and add a
little bit in all those this does is
just add a little bit of texture to my
hair so that it stays thick and big for
the whole day I just scrunch it in you
don't need a lot of this stuff at all
because it's got a lot of texture to it
Springs tad bit of hairspray just to
hold the curl so this is literally it
for the hair guys honestly it's so quick
and easy she's really messy beachy waves
the great thing about these curls as
well if they lasted days like throwing
dry shampoo in your hair select the next
few days you do what you want with it
you can put up eight completely up to
you so like this is how I feel like but
that is it for this get ready with me I
really hope that you guys enjoyed this I
love doing these kind of sit-down
talking and get ready with me they're
just so chill when my favorite to film
