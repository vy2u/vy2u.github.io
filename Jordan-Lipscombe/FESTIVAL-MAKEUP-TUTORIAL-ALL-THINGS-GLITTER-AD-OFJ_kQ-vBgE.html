super excited for today's video because
it helped me to be a little bit crazier
well try and be creative I'm not like
the best but I'm trying so I filmed this
festival and makeup look for you I
really want to play around with makeup
but I still wanted it to be quite
wearable and I think I've done that I've
gone for somewhere like in between so
I've just gone through this like a pinky
oranjee kind of vibe like throughout my
street and it's not as hard as it looks
I promise I feel like when you're going
to like a one day fast forward like a
few day first of all this is still like
appropriate because even on that first
day you could go a bit more glam make it
a little bit more effort and then the
rest you can just do whatever the I hope
you guys enjoy this video out so much
fun filming it love being creative arm
yes if you do want to see how I got this
look then just keep watching something a
little slower dices makeup look because
honestly I have no idea why I'm doing my
makeup today I'm just winging it so I
feel like so this is the save option I'm
going to prime my lids with concealer
this one is the collection lasting
perfection concealer I look like I've
got no eyes again swear this happens in
like every makeup tutorial reduce blend
this out of course with them my blender
booty blender okay if you bear a while
the bean blend out it is saying
something oh so crazy it might be better
like I forget I like to eat you my face
and like she's just going to set that in
place so we get no creasing there's a
jig
all over my face from my hair this
little guy is going to be the main I
should have Huggett that we use for this
makeup look and I'm so excited because
anything go I'm like I mean Kim can you
tell Peter this would be a two-faced it
go into a bomb I shoulda palette this is
brand new out and it's insane like look
at these colors
I guess like these are all printers and
of course I'm going to need some
transition colors and stuff I'm going to
come back to this in a sec so first I'm
going to take this eyeshadow here called
cheekier by a makeup geek
transitions just popping this
color-block macri's really focus it on
the inner corner here
I'm going to binnacle the end bottle and
all my eyebrows new plucking maskull's
girls going it on the outer corner to
taking it like all the way up to that
brow and you've sawing a holes down
taking a rock away from makeup geek
which is just amazing like orange color
take a look after that I'm focusing this
color lower than that Tiki tikis public
school just going to keep building up as
well don't be frying down some boys to
get that color on there then I'm really
going to pack this color on the outer
half of my eyes do I do this next step
this is the make-or-break moment this is
one of those moments we have to like sit
back and watch evaluate your licensing
till I do this is risky anyone else do
that make our biz like it's like
eyeliner you're not to put on your
eyeshadow and run your eye shows it s up
you know no you know what let's do it
let's do it so I'm going to be like a
half cup creasing at the front everybody
wish me luck taking some of the
collection concealer on this little
little bitty brush I'm just going to
start coughing it oh oh my hand is not
steady today hopefully you guys can see
but I've actually got above the crease
so that when I look forward you can see
it like thinking of us
Oh take my finger and blending in that
eyeshadow and the concealer here so it's
like a seamless blend well I tend to now
take them to Facebook I should've had it
this is so cool because you get eight
different glitters like they're pressed
pigment glares and then you get a
brightening base which is this white one
and intensifying base which is a black
one so obviously if you want your
glitter to come across a lighter and
more like you can supply on your base if
you want it to be like BAM the dark on
which is so cool I've never seen a brand
do that so a two-faced babes you're
doing it right and they have that glow
as well so if you really want that to
come in to stick and have less pulled
out and stuff definitely use this
because this makes an amazing base I'm
thinking fairy dust which is this
amazing like white pinky color and I
just need it dry going straight from the
black on the inner third following that
like concealer line that we made so
exams like look at that that is dry as
well that's insane so I know that the
two-faced ball collection is available
online on their website from June 15 and
then it's available in stores and online
as we might Debenhams with Selfridges
and staff from let me check my memory
isn't very good August last so there's
some dates for you to put in your
Diaries I'm going to go off camera real
quick to do that on this I so a little
bit more normal and in a bomb all human
and then I'll be back
so in like one second you see me well in
three two one
I'm going to be applying Atlassian's of
course we are give me some mascara too
of course blend my lashes with the fab
ones one of my faves this would be too
faced better than sex mascara I love
this mascara I've used this in a few
tutorials before it's bomb better than
sex
I mean it's up to you guys but for real
though this is a freaking goodness gosh
like a look at my lashes from that
mascara so good I loved it and it
doesn't like transfer or anything
sometimes about hot where's online
mascara and stuff can transfer up here
I'm like but this doesn't so it's
definitely a safe and volume and link at
the same time like hell yes does anybody
else feel a tree sniffing a new mascara
like well no neck right now okay my
mascara is done these are the lashes I'm
going to use I've used them before so
I'm just like holding them up our
backstage lashes in the star Melrose
Avenue these and also the star rodeo dry
on my save using jira lash glue to stick
them on to my eyeballs this is the
ablack quando which I've really been
liking hello Renee you got me onto this
I'm going to go ahead and stick this on
real quick you guys assuming apply
lashes like 20 billion trillion million
billion times sometimes you guys are
stuck the best way to do it is right to
the glue dries tacky stick down the
middle first the inner corner then the
outside that's how I find to be the
easiest way I just use my fingers for
fun as well I find it easy i Kuragin I
am using what my mama gave me but if you
are struggling tweezers works out too
I'm going to start on my base and then
it come back to my eyes what is that my
face is up eyelash glue my prime Marc
Torres today is the NYX shine killer
because you know I'm an oily mess so
putting that in the t-zone area because
that is where I need the most oil
control by my foundation this is
something pretty pricey and I've never
shared before my channel even though
goggle eyes I do we like it if I love my
drugstore foundation like my lawyer too
much so good but I just want to be
shopping you some difference I'm using
the ax marks makers remarkable
foundation I hate that I love there
because I hate that it's just so
expensive my color is
thirty-six beige golden which suits my
time nicely it's nice and yellow full by
the way of my Facebook fully patched
himself is because I did facedown out
just to let you know I just remember
this is a very full coverage foundation
and I probably didn't need to put that
much on oh it's okay I could use maybe
you can just kind of share out a little
bit like I said it's a pretty heavy GG
foundation but I last on my skin like
all day so it's perfect for kind of
festivals and so I'll end it down my
neck as well did you hear that I want to
make sure that face much as our neck oh
I really knew we okay so to cover up
feedbags
I'm using the collection master section
concealer that I mix it with some the LA
girl Pro conceal in the yellow corrector
really like the coverage of this
collection one base a bit to kind of
pink sign for my under-eye personally so
mix them together and it works all okay
it's pretty light
that's okay this normally works by super
tender the moment kind I forgot about
that I blend all of that and I also
highlighted my face with it as well oh
yes honey that is full coverage and I
love Annette does anybody else like this
sometimes I wake up and I'm like I want
no makeup on what so ever want to be
free and then other mornings I might
shake and I just put like my entire
makeup collection on my facebook it's
actually going to cream contour slush
bronze today just occurred I'm actually
going to be putting on a lot of blush
and snow bronzer so this is so quick
like it makes it so easy this is the
benefit hoola quickie contour stick
angular she just goes down do you see on
this thing is so easy to blend out this
is good and it also have some really
nice flush of color to my skin okay cool
now I'm going to go ahead and set my
face with my Rimmel stay matte powder
take a big soft brush and everywhere
take a smaller brush I'm just going to
set underneath my eyes stop those
creases
I have ulis goodness it is that I love
twice for musicals so good you won't
think I'm 19 with you you know what I am
actually going to go in with a quick
sweep of my Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer just because I feel like a
little bit more color white has bronze
is so nice like every time I use it
little bits of hologram I'm often a
month chocolate right that is actually
what I'm going to do like quickly
quickly
why do i whistle
my face what is this I'm doing things
differently today normally I do not pile
on the blush I mean I just like a quick
of color but like pink all around this
area here and I'm going to join it into
the eyeshadow you'll see I mean I'm
using the anyway a blush in the color
called bubblegum I'm just putting it
where I normally would put blush and I'm
working it right back to my hairline and
up on my forehead keep adding the color
bit by bit to get as intense as you like
it honestly feels so weird at first
putting this much blush on my face but
you definitely what the most going to be
care and not like here because otherwise
I look a little crazy you know take my
orange eyeshadow again now and I'm going
to basically blend my eyeshadow in with
the blush just put it back then some of
the orange into the blush as well so
everything is together speaking on the
outer corner right back to my temple
kind of create like a winged hair on the
outer corner and then just blending into
the pink same again on this side guys
you know turn our face back towards our
sample the key to this just keep like
adding a blend and blend up and if you
think you've been it off then again to
make sure this is one reason for my
highlight this is incredible this is the
Primark bronze highlight glow
I like highlighting palette how much is
this look like the Anastasia Beverly
Hills on taking a mixture of the pink on
the bronze shade and I'm just going to
put this on the high points take a look
how insane that is
and of course is accessible we can just
go crazy with the highlight and I feel
like it's totally acceptable to finish
out the eyes I'm going back in with the
Too Faced glitter eye shadow palette so
I'm going to start with a brightening
base and then I'm going to go over the
top with the color work in which is
amazing like pinky gold shade but first
I'm going to go in with their glitter
glue just so that I get like no fallout
and everything sticks nicely because hey
I'm not want to ruin my makeup now not
at this stage so I'm just taking the
brightening base first and then I'm
going to spray my brush so that it's wet
because you can use it our shadows wet
and then they become like insanely
pigmented yes look at that glitter
that's so cool and bringing it down
quite low it's all smoothed out do you
know what I love about these not only
are they glitter so see you get that
sparkle but they have color to them look
like they're pigment glitter so
can use it like underneath my eye like
this and still have the glitter like
works amazingly about writing based
underneath as well 3 helps to make the
color pop when you secure it glue
underneath want to see this steps like
this is not budging this look anywhere
which of course the festivals imperfect
as you can see I had no fallout as well
my makeup is intact just throwing on
some bottom lash mascara real quick
still using me to face bed and sex as
well know what I'll be going with racket
I say my shadow color and then I don't
my cheek just add some more like color
and shine yes oh my god look at that
that looks so like shiny shiny she needs
even a word you know you see it except
my pink and gold here he owes exactly
what I want it he'll know I had a little
bit of lipstick on my teeth I was
testing out lipsticks and had it on that
delimitation of it I'm going to take me
NYX lingerie liquid lipstick in the
colour after hours which is just like
warm toned Brown and then for in the
middle its kind of practice like
gradient look I'm taking the Too Faced
melted matte liquid lipstick in a pool
girl just throwing it little hair cut my
lips together and then just blend it in
with my finger and then lastly back into
the Too Faced palette I'm taking oh it's
RI which of this gold color
and just put it in the middle of my
bottom lip and then hey this wouldn't be
accessible makeup look if I didn't put
some like white dots or lines or
something on my face right oh my god I
was makeup all over my hands
I'm using it be a trustee and NYX white
liquid layer and I think I just add some
dots around by my eyebrows here first
trying to make them as like circular as
possible okay I wasn't going to do this
because a lot of people have done it but
I feel like this look won't be complete
and they look like a white line down my
lip here I feel like it needs it I want
to keep the white like dot welcome stuff
really minimal on my face so I feel like
this will kind of pull it all together
name is Luka John so this is I'll get
tired out I'm actually pretty happy with
the way it turned out considering I have
no idea what I was doing when I sat down
I just put makeup on my face if you guys
