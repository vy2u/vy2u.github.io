channel I hope your week is going
savages so today's video is a full phase
of Holy Grail products so if you ever
wanted to know what my favorite like
foundation is powder is lip glosses
highlight ears lashes is it - whatever
this is a video for you it just includes
all of my favorite makeup items I've
currently been off freaking obsessed
with I just thought you know what let's
make a place where I can put all of my
current favorite go-to products in and I
thought to kind of add to that I will do
my current go to glam but simple and
easy makeup looks which is of course why
I'm wearing now obviously this is like
my glam simple makeup not just like
simple everyday this is like if you want
to feel a little bit extra a little bit
glam but I would say it's still quick
and easy because there's no eyeshadow no
line or anything it's just pretty much
super skin focus so if you do want to
know not only what my go-to makeup look
is but also my favorite products at the
moment just keep watching okay guys so
before a cellphone in to leave just
excuse the fact that my face is like 10
freaking shades lighter than the rest of
my body
The Fixer on is just gone from the face
obviously what I told my foundation
staff my face will be twinning with the
body so that's our brows as per usual
I've already filled - they don't
naturally look like this I wish they
naturally look like this but I won't
list in that department about my Holy
Grail eyebrow products has to be by
benefit may kill it they kill the brow
game I have to do more products here
because honestly I just switched between
the both because they're that good
they're like it I have the precisely on
my brow pencil and also the Cabrera
which is their pomade I love them both
just as much as each other so I will use
the perm eight what I want more of that
like insta Brel you know it's really
like and then when I want something a
little bit more unnatural I'll go to the
pencil but they're really good if you do
want to see these in action I have used
them in past videos before I'll link a
couple below did you hear my bris
quickly and that will gross literally
lost track of what we're saying they're
good yeah I will leave a couple videos
in below of where I've used them but I
thought I need some lip balm these lips
Heather dry right so for my favorite
primer this is the primer that whenever
I open that drawer
the ham just described there you guys
probably get that benefit professional
at this product is so far like it feels
in my pores creates a really nice base
on my makeup to sit on make some skin
feel smooth it's just she loved it
also shout out to this little guy she's
chilling on my nose at the moment I
didn't write it but like he just don't
mind is me my skin at the moment though
you guys have been breaking out like a
little bit it's been my time in the
month though if you fill me in are so
been kicking around and then if I feel
like my skin is feeling a little bit dry
a little bit crusty so to taste hangover
RX so nice in fact you know what let's
just put a little bit running outside or
you know this stuff which is also
calling on my skin super hydrating
oh my god I just realized haven't even
set my eyebrows in place and never used
to wear eye brow gels never thought they
made a difference or anything so I like
yes but this change the game this is the
Aiko a brow gel styling define consid
brow booster this genuinely sticks my
eyebrows in place like they are not
going anywhere it just sticks onto the
hair so my eyebrows actually look like
they are made out of hair and it sets
them down you know when your eyebrows
feel kind of hard I like that because I
know that the brow gel works this is
exactly what this does so in love again
so if I go to look recently I've been
obsessed with super glowy skin you know
when your skin kind of looks wet and
just super hydrating like so how I do
that is you guys know about these I kind
of don't shut up about these sorry Real
Talk though I feel like every girl and
boy that just loves highlighter you
honestly need these in your life they
work so well for freaking everything you
can use it on your face as a base to
your foundation to make your foundation
it really glowy
you can use it just from like the high
points as your highlighter you can use
as a base to your highlighter you can
even use it on your body which while go
a little bit of that a bit of sure I'm
going on today there is no glitter nor
sparkle or no nothing in this it's just
pure like wetness wetness is that in a
word
they are so fab so I've already used
some on my body now I'm going to go
ahead and put some on my skin underneath
my foundation
to make my foundation have that extra
little I'm going to mix together guvo
and original it's going to create just
already nice bronzy glow we've space
that will shine for our foundation I
know right now I'm looking a little bit
crazy looking a little bit 10 madness
should I see when you put on your
foundation stuff it's not going to look
this intense so for my foundation I have
two different ones that I reached for
the most one two six I mention and one
is a liquid we have a law real too much
and the Make Up For Ever HD gene Fuji HD
foundation that's stick now cut a
depends I'm going for that will like
determine which one I use too much I
guess people would say as more of your
like everyday foundation I do this
because like to me makeups whatever and
I just wear anything at any time and
then makeup for everyone has a little
bit more below and coverage to where
I've has anything I'm going to use the
makeup for ever one it today so I'm just
going to perf you lines on my hat and
sort of like bust this into the skin
first with a brush and then go in with
the blender you know I'm literally just
obsessed with how the foundation looks
on the skin like a new seed house of
full coverage but yet sort of like to
natural has match this full coverage can
be it looks on my skin and as you can
see look how like Hello Julie this is
because we put those drops underneath I
am glowing mind in the brows and then
yeah like I said take the sponge and
just press it on top this is going to
kind of soak up any excess products and
just sort of toch it into the skin even
more I just realized the concealer I'm
obsessed with is another makeup forever
product don't hate me
ocean the products so good this is the
Ultra HD at foundation foundation no
it's not if the consumer Jordan get it
together you apply it with a concealer
brush first you don't need a lot of this
because a little bitterness goes a long
way take it right into the inner corners
as well because for me that's where I
get a lot of discoloration so then with
a hyped up I just highlight with this as
well by the way if you do want to know
my favorite drugstore concealer if you
are looking for something a little bit
more affordable Maybelline fit me that's
good too right I think we are good too
it's everything in place I have been
loving the Too Faced Born This Way loose
setting powder I just want you guys know
what I'm using quite a few
by n4x in this video but that doesn't
mean I don't love drugstore honestly I
do that's why I'm trying to give you
like the drugstore alternative these are
just like my Holy Grail products I
wouldn't put them in if I didn't love
them just keeping it real with you guys
this is genuinely what I've been
reaching for I've been wearing like not
so just saying underneath my eyes and
always my face with this powder just you
know I leave this area here like where I
highlight because I'm going to go back
in with the iconic drops I'm an oily
mess so if I don't do this step I end up
with like a hot mess at the end of the
day okay right so this bronzer and last
days I honestly don't think this is
given enough credit here on YouTube
I don't know I because it's like fun
this would be a body shot a bronzing
powder now mine is a number 4 which is
my favorite color obviously there's
other colors as well but what I love
most about this is it's so hard to find
a drugstore under this mat this is I
just love the color as well I do also
really like the makeup forever from dust
to make up from everything I've been
using this one that loads recently so
got to give it some creds
I think waivers left on my brush and
just put it down the sides and like the
tip of my nose if you like I don't do
this middle of my face just looks so
bland like an or bronzey here and there
like the middle just like just give it a
little fill some clinic so that is it
for my blogs art now for blush when it
comes to blush it'll be Bart benefit
California or team Milani baked blush in
Luminoso now to be honest with you
they're actually kind of similar they
both had a glow to your skin as well as
color California is a little bit darker
but I'm going to use the Milani won it
today so pop it on that the apples and
then bringing it back to kind of blend
everything together so like I said
heading back in with the iconic
illuminator drops because I just I can't
get enough of them just going to put
some drops here and here but o1b
guardian but Jesus not that much by the
way this is the color original which is
the middle shade so it can sue a budget
and skin tones wish you know I'm what
about there is not one skin tone in the
world and hopefully you guys can see
we're going to set my face in this place
it allows the illuminator to kind of
stick to the foundation and look even
more glowy if you put on powder it's a
little bit harder to blend out it works
just a little bit harder so if you just
put it straight onto your foundation
girl you're going to look wet take a
look at this honestly insane so it now
for eyes this is going to be a dead
simple I use no eyeshadow no nothing
we're just going to put on some mascara
stick on some lashes and we're done
could you go struggle with false
eyelashes I'll share with you a couple
of my favorite mascara to maybe help you
look like you're wearing those policies
and I've said this before but I actually
find putting on falsies quicker than
putting on mascara which is so strange
but so true this is one of my favorite
mascaras and it's drugstore the
Maybelline lash sensational so good and
there is a warp recession as well so if
you do struggle to keep your IRS code
use waterproof it always helps need to
get a quick and personal with my mirror
I'm just applying a quick but still
pretty generous coat of mascara I'm just
putting this on to make sure you blend
in with the bull's eye lashes obviously
if you just wear mascara you can go cray
apply as many clicks as you okay I think
we've got these are the lashes that I
have been up freaking south where
they're the iconic London lashes in the
style pretty sure they're in the style
Spears so just like PC and wispy they
just make your eyes just look so good I
can't even describe them I won these so
much recently a little bit ratchet
probably should get a new pair but I
mean they're like as good as new so best
lash glue ever duo you need it you shrug
with your lashes try out this blue
because they ain't moving trophies you
go see how they just like flare out in
the outer corner I love them because it
makes my eyes look a little bit more
cottage shape I don't even have to wear
wing liner which breeze Ord
everyone knows about the struggles a
window that I like so real iconic have
only recently come out of lashes as well
and holy crap they're killing the game
keep building and they go something
different for me I haven't been applying
anything to my lower lashline no mascara
no nothing I have been loving away my
eyes I've been looking recently without
putting anything there so I'm like the
of course can't forget and then
if you guys follow me on instagram which
I mean if you stone
I mean UK you would have seen that I
have either been wearing a nude glossy
lip or a red lip honestly those two at
the moment I'm just like slick in
between listen I love them and I have to
say
Maybelline lip products I have been
wearing them non-stop really good color
payoff lost so well on my lips even a
gloss
now usually grosses on me they're like
they're for half an hour and then
they're like see how they're like as
though lost a real long time I'm going
to wear the nude lip today but I would
have called tell you what my favorite
red lipstick is so I've been loving the
Maybelline matte lipstick in 930 nude
embrace I just put the lipstick on as a
little bit of a base for the lipstick I
just find that it works nicely
oh these lipsticks what can you see this
how creamy they are then if I over the
top I've been putting on the vivid hot
last cut in Pease which is this amazing
like baby pink gloss like look look how
pigmented is this color though like put
not even sticky Maybelline even set
Amelie like children you need to try the
color tease and I was like I think now
I'm like obsessed so Maybelline thank
you and then the red lipstick I've been
wearing non-stop is the Maybelline vivid
matte liquid in the color summer talk
rebel red this is called and oh my
freaking God this is the perfect reddish
shade
you know sometimes red to me either too
pink or too purple
this one is just like red straya which
is why I've been loving it so I is this
the finished look so this is the
completed makeup look I really hope you
