my face right now is a four-phase or
first impressions but using PR makeup so
that is makeup that I have really really
kindly been sent I've not been asked to
talk about or anything it's just things
that I've been sent by brands and I just
want to try off you guys and give my
honest opinion just want out in there as
well just because I've been sent
something doesn't mean that it's going
to influence my opinion so early on it's
like because at the end of the day if I
don't like something I don't like
something like moving on spa I was so
lucky in this video just going to say
that before is again I just miss a huge
thank you to anyone who sends me
anything
what the hell and actually melts my
heart I hope it is so sweet like nobody
has to do that so I'm so so grateful but
yeah if you do want to see how I created
this eye look and not only my
impressions or things I haven't tried
before but new products are out right
now at current hot products and just
keep watching okay so I'm going to start
off by doing something with these the
Browns I'm actually going to use one of
the benefit eyebrow products this one is
the precisely my brow pencil I mean it
shade for but I can also use shade free
as well just got number 4 here with me
today
first off packaging sizer so one end is
a little spoolie and the other is the
pen Oh yep cool is a pencil and it's
called as well because it twists up
which means you don't have to sharp now
like how much more convenient is that I
hate sharpening pencils so annoying rich
smudge proof color lasts 12 hours
natural looking hair like strokes come
on yeah so something I really like if
the post itself is really small so I can
really get in there and fill in my
eyebrows and it filled in my scar I know
a good eyebrow product is it considering
my scar and it's really nicely pigmented
it's nice to blend out so I can get that
gradient at the front basically I like
it now I need to try make this brow look
somewhat related to this one oh look
yeah what exact oh it's not gonna lie
though it's also weird using our eyebrow
pencil I'm like what are you I'm just so
used to using upon made like dipping my
brush in a little pot and being like
skinny now I want to set these puppies
in place and you need this so this is
the ico brow gel
Lupe's have any color Tintagel at
robbery stuff I think I have a little
bit of color to it soon find out I
really like the way that's like clinging
on to my brow hairs poking my brows
actually look like they're made of hair
actually know what I'm you're just going
to fill my eyebrows because I like the
feeling when they feel stuck to my face
yummy okay actually puzzle over hard
which is good because it means my
eyebrows not gonna fly up now it is time
to do something was this for primer I'm
going to try out their specific dr.
Brandt pores no more horrifying primer
now I've had some sad things about this
primer don't let me down you can pick
this little guy up on beautybay they
actually send our package of so the new
goodies and I'm like just so excited to
try it why is this not correct this is
meant to be an instant massif Iying pore
refiner primer which that whole thing
just sounds like everything I need
oh so just of color to it Coenen like it
does very strong smells a little bit
like tea tree oil and the consistency is
really odd it's like a mix between a
silicone and a serum my mind right now
is just like what is going on don't even
notice my skin that does feel really
really soft so I don't have so much to
say about it right now but actually make
sure you're following me on my snapchat
and I'll update you guys on there I'll
give a little like review of this cheeky
little plug in there okay so I can be
pleasure to talk about the fact that
this foundation comes in a box a look
you just pull out the box it's
mind-blowing
this is the la splash cream foundation
I've got a column nutmeg which is one of
the medium shades so I'm hoping it
matches me fingers across rows using
like my color brain like my color
matching brain to try and like work this
out a little ball I don't know why I had
the urge to come back then I was just
like okay so just a little heads up I'm
actually going to be using all Sigma
makeup brushes in this video they sent
me a bunch of them and I'm so excited to
use them because honestly this is like
the softest thing ever I have actually
used a couple of their eye Russians
before super impressed so now it's time
for you
these ones and everything I'll tell you
what brush them using as we go along but
yeah just wanted to let y'all know okay
so the foundation is a ultra defined
cream matte finish paraben fragrance
free fall of Florence
can I speak English I don't know if
you're honest full coverage foundation I
can just test this out oh actually kind
of like a gel
however we know how much to apply but
I'm just going to like now taking a
sigma f80 I'm just going to oh okay high
coverage the teen bit line at the manner
that it can oxidize I don't know if you
guys can see that but you have to work
with it pretty quickly because it starts
dry I was going to have to have a
workout okay so so far actually quite
like it it's Jeffrey a matte finish
which don't normally go for but hey I
would say medium to full coverage and of
a full coverage girl so it works for me
this dries hello quick look if I fill my
face right now
no look at it though is selling in life
I didn't even though I had definitely
need some consider these bags not play
around today benefit buying a hydrating
at concealer I'm number two by the way I
have used the ever fine I really liked
it but I do not even I don't think I've
even looked at this okay now so weird
there's like the concealer in the middle
and then that must be the hydrate and
stuff on the outside this is probably
back though so when I used to use a
concealer like you to look like this and
used to help your spots you see use it
when I was like 12 just right the back
and it's a sheer coverage I me
personally not sheer coverage kind of
girl I'm kind of like all or nothing so
I don't know how I'm going to feel about
this bar look if I go okay this
literally feels so weird kind of slimy
feeling and it's creeping me a little
bell you guys are going to be so shocked
by this okay but for the first time ever
I'm going to use a real pee vendor I
know I've always used the Real
Techniques sponge and then happy with it
and never thought to try this just when
I run out underwater
I'm excited and actually you know what
I'm not matter that concealer definitely
is sheer coverage but it's made
everything look really glowy
I prefer a little bit more coverage but
that's cool and I didn't feel like this
fund would feel different to the Real
Techniques sponge but it actually does
it doesn't hold as much water I feel
like
going to try this out this would be a
2004 this way a saying powder Texas on
underneath my eyes
I've not baked in literally forever okay
we're been using a sigma f a large
powder brush I'm just going to set the
rest for my face whoa pal everywhere
this brush is literally so soft
oh it seems me set my face really nicely
and it doesn't look retry on my face I
feel it that's how I know the powder if
it looks really dry and crusty on my
skin I'm like no thank you now taking a
sigma f30 seven spot light duster i'm
just going to dust away this oh yes
brush it even softer how they can
possibly I look like a ghost because I'm
going to lose theirs now going to hopper
hands up
have you used this before not going like
I've not used all the shades in here so
I feel like still conical this is the
under Kate naked skin at shapeshifter
palette so you open up as a pesky
powders on one side flip this I can then
those creams on this side and it comes
to the mirror as well like how hard you
dandy is that I'm gonna stick to the
parlors I'm going to sit with bronzer
shade on the end with a Sigma F 20 large
powder brush so that this would be a
good shape for bronze like this soft
sleek sinner you feel me I'm scared I'm
not doing this brush for my bronzer it's
a bit too dense so I'm going to switch
what about this one will that work
yeah is a f40 a large angled contour
that is actually so much better
let me try success under here let's just
try like for rond for dodging away props
of this brush so it blended it out so
well a brush shave the day you're going
to take the contour shade now on a sigma
f05 a small contour brush this is where
we can go from a zero to muddy
real quick I'm hoping it doesn't make me
look muddy I've mixed it before with the
bronzer and it was fine but by itself
Oh
okay it's not muddy but like that's
intense this brush is so cute though I
guess it's perfectly here it's like okay
cool I think we are good I do really
like that palette it's just pretty
intense so I don't want so more intense
I mean for a night out of the pink
probably will be picking this up now to
try this out from its Sigma this is it
called DeRosa or a powder basically this
is their flash and it looks like this
using this on a 2 Sigma F 1505 our
powder sash blush brush oh that is so
pretty
adding the perfect little special
cutouts like a well guard like these
definitely didn't but I wish I did
well I mean I could just roll it over
and be like give me apples
I never used to do this because I have
the meanest face oh I used to think it
just made me look round up but you know
what
I'm just embracing my roundness these
days for yeah really kubera brush lash
and brush to brush and blush I have two
choices for highlighted here I don't
want to do though I'm actually going to
use this because I haven't had anyone
you talked about this this is the SOS
you Suzanne Jackson highlight our kit
six different highlighters in here and
there's a mirror as well using a f03
high cheekbone highlighter I'm going to
so you know what I'm going to mix this
one here which is called shooting stars
and Peach Smoothie Oh free what's nice
is you can like a build them up but to
get them like there so basically you can
choose how much you want a dime and I
love that
are you okay but if you never heard of
her I'm pretty sure she's a blog I don't
you come up with a ton of stuff like
this a notion is kind of eyelashes as
well which I actually saw it in Primark
and guys you need them so I'm 5 pounds
and they're so good so I've seen you
guys in a little bit because mo who it
is time I don't think you guys
understand how excited I am to use this
bad boy like I received this in PR when
I was way of benefit for a couple days
but now that I'm back I can finally use
this I've been dying to look at this
I have a feeling that this is going to
be my favorite ethnic a palette I just
have even the brush is getting excited
I'm going to go in with a conical sauce
on a e35 type of blending brush from
Sigma and you should use that as my
transition color or there is a little
bit of kickback but that looks like how
can we slow pigmented these are going
out so well can you see that I'm going
to take a mixture of the color T devil
and cayenne signals how you say it and
just Pat that on the outer corner and
inner corner high pigment welcome this
is a III 5 brush by long way so holy
crap
pigment is mental or first lending the
edges out with that same brush we used
France transition color I've been
planning this for like 5 seconds and
look it's like done is so good
cults and association that a helper 3
cell has to give it to these super
brushes like when you have a good
blending brush license it now I'm going
to take this little baby brush this is a
pencil brush nice a and I'm going to use
fortune I use I'm going to put the color
called and you go and if you go I don't
even know but it's basically just a dark
red and use that just to deepen
everything a little bit there is just a
teeny teeny bit of fallout but is
nothing crazy like considering how
pavement if these are I'm sure I'm now
taking the f70 concealer brush it's
basically just a little flat brush I
know it's at the clinical dirty tool
which donate level just pack that on the
lid
I didn't even wet the brush now my are
you kidding
could you imagine what these are like
wet though I said like you need to do it
that actually looks Ford okay I'm kind
of obsessed like this has to be my
favorite and mikay palette and to be
honest with you I actually think this is
probably my favorite eyeshadow palette I
own that's a big thing to say because I
know a lot of freaking palettes but holy
crap no way everybody's talking about
this but it is so good
and
using a mixture of cayenne and RF you go
on my bottom lash line this brush oh my
god why I'm not use this on my lower
lash line - no it's the e-40 five small
taper blending that paces the product
that blends out all at the same time I
wasn't going to do wing line our bar SS
will do it we're going to try this else
expert liquid liner of course it's in
black and I'm going to attempt to do a
wing oh it's really nice brush okay so
first off how black is this liner and
secondly I don't think I've ever done my
wings at this quick before the brush on
this made it so easy and elf is a
drugstore brand I think this is like
three pounds or something
I just mean another discovery okay now
Milosh is where you wear these are the
lashes that I'm going to try these are
dealer lashes in the style Miami these
look so pretty so I'm going to quickly
golf camera apply some mascara and put
the session on and then I will eat back
to cut them a little bit but are these
just not so pretty they were
ridiculously easy to apply because a
large fan is so thin they just kind of
like fell on my eyes it was just like
done the last thing to try out is lip
products so I was so excited when I
found a beautybay now stop jouer I've
been trying to get my hands on the
skinny dipped lip top off for so long
now I have it so I'm going to start off
by trying the gol long-wear lip cream
liquid lipstick in the color bath which
I believe is a nude oh my god that's so
pretty oh my god that smells in cups
that smells incredible religious loves
like a strawberry milkshake or something
this application makes it really easy to
apply really okay feels comfortable the
only thing is I don't know the color a
suit some makeup in my opinion I think
it's too pink for it so I might grab the
top of something else just tuck it over
the top with my Jeffrey staff liquid
lipstick and hunty because it's a bit
more Brown which I think much as the
eyes a little bit better then going to
top off with some of the as you a skinny
dip the lip top ah I'm so excited I'm
dead
I always forgot savoring this is the Too
Faced hangover 3 and one replenishing
primer and saying spray apparently this
smells amazing so I'm so excited to use
this oh it smells like a pina colada
the mist is so nice I don't know if you
guys can see but it's so fine feels good
maybe just like a couple more better so
this is the finished look I love doing
first impressions because not only are
there just products I haven't used
before but there's like current products
that are sort of hot and on trend right
now and I get to share with you my
opinion on Weber I think they're worth
buying or not and honestly that was not
a product in this video that I didn't
like we're just so crazy because I
literally put everything possible all my
face as well see I really hope you guys
