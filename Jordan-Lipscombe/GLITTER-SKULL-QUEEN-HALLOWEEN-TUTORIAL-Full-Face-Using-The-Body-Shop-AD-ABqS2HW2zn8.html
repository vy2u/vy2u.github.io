me to create a Halloween makeup look
using their makeup products which I am
just so excited to do so starting with
my naked face I'm taking the body shop
all-in-one instable primer and just
using this as my base and then for my
foundation I'm going to take the body
shop fresh nude foundation I have this
in two colors but I went with the
lighter one in the end and then using
this I think this is their face mask
brush but I use it for my foundation it
worked perfectly and then I'm going to
add in a few of their lightening drops
as well if you know me you know I love
these and I'm just going to apply that
all over my skin you don't actually need
to apply it to the bottom half of your
face because in the end I actually ended
up just taking it off but hey I was
literally making this up as I went along
so but yeah I was super excited to film
this because I pretty much use their
makeup to create this look bar like two
or three things so anyone can do this
but I'm now going in with a lot
concealer underneath my eyes bridge of
my nose middle of my forehead
just because I'm half of our face will
be human so I kind of want to still do
what I usually would do and I always
have a little friend joining us anyways
so I'm now going to take the bodyshop
loose powder in 0-2 and I'm going to
take this on their little gold kabuki
brush like how cute is this and I'm just
going to pack this underneath my eyes to
bake a little bit then I'm taking the
huge angled kabuki brush I love this for
setting all over my face because it just
does it so quickly and now moving on to
my brows and I'm gonna take this a
bodyshop brow kit I think this is a
medium and I'm just gonna fill in my
brows and I am using my own brush to do
this it does come with a little brush
inside but I chose to just use my iron
because I find it a lot quicker because
I spent like 10 hours doing this video
anyway and I have to say I never use
powder to fill in my eyebrows but I have
to say that this this little brow kit is
good
and then to dust away that bake now for
my eyes I'm going in with this body shop
down-to-earth palette like this
eyeshadow palette is amazing and I'm
taking the body shop little crease
blending brush as well
I have everything linked in the
description box by the way and so I'm
taking the kind of cream shade and just
using that as a base and then I'm going
in with this kind of gray beige color
and I'm going to put this into the
crease and kind of above that just as my
transition color then I'm going to take
this body shop honey bronze and I'm
actually going to use this as an
eyeshadow and I'm just going to take on
the same brush and just put that in the
crease I don't know why but as I was
going along I kind of felt like I needed
more warmth I don't know I'm obsessed
with warm eyeshadows so it's just an
excuse um but I'm gonna take this
itty-bitty little shader brush from the
body shop and the black eyeshadow in the
palette and guys oh my god this black
eyeshadow is so freakin pigmented it's
amazing I'm just gonna pack that all
over the lids I'm not going to go as
high up into the crease though because
I'm going to leave a little bit of room
to blend it out and I'm gonna take this
bodyshop little domed
blending brush I don't know I think
that's a name I don't know I'm gonna
leave it in the description box below
anyways because I can't remember but
this is amazing it's like dense enough
that it keeps the color where it is but
it blends out at the same time it was
just a really good choice
and going in without shader brush again
I'm just gonna pack on even more black
eyeshadow to make it super super dark
and on that fluffy eyeshadow blending
brush I'm going to take the colors that
we use in our crease just underneath and
then of course with that shader brush
putting some black eyeshadow as close to
the lower lashline as I possibly can and
then blending it all together and
because this is a glitter kind of skull
I'm going to take some eyelash glue and
some silver glitter and just pack that
on in the inner corners of my eyes and
then I'm going to whack on some mascara
as well I will be applying false
eyelashes just to complete the eye look
but I mean completely up to you you do
whatever you want to do and I don't
always forgot actually I did apply this
bodyshop smokey eye definer and in the
waterline just to make the eyes super
dark
and now I am taking the bodyshop black
liquid liner and I'm just going to fill
in the inner corners of my eyes just to
make sure that lashes are like
completely blended in to my lash line
and you can't see them like poking up
and now I'm taking this body shop honey
bronzer highlighter and this is
incredible guys like look at the globe
this gives me it's amazing and I'm just
using my finger to press that onto the
highest points of my face and I know
that we're doing like half skull but
like the human side of us has to be
glowing right and now I am taking this
type of brush from the body shop as well
and just ensuring that that is fully
blended now onto the skull portion of
this makeup look so I'm going to take
this body shop Mac gel liner and just
start outlining the shape I want the
only way I can describe this shape is
kind of like a spider's web I guess that
you kind of go in and out and create
like points where you can attach the
face to the skull kind of thing
then I also decided just to add a couple
like around my temples so it looks even
more attached in the end now this is the
part I was talking about where I had to
just take off the complete but on half
of my face because my foundation and the
white facepaint was mixing so I'm just
taking the pain and filling in the
bottom half of my face it was a little
bit hard to work with though so another
alternative that you could use is the
body shop shaded dusting drops as well
then I just took some translucent powder
and literally like packed this onto the
white facepaint so that the eyeshadows
and stuff I blends on top didn't blend
in with the white like I was like
choking on power you guys I put so much
on then going back into that body shot
palette and that black eyeshadow because
it's my favorite I use it for out the
video all the time I'm just creating the
no shape so I start off creating like a
V and then I go ahead and bring it the
edges down to join in the middle I don't
know how to describe this they're kind
of like a Batman symbol I don't know and
I'm just taking the bodyshop liquid
liner again and just filling in that
shape
I wanted to add some more glitter
somewhere em so I took some more lash
glue and just put some silver glare over
the top of that just to have like a
little glittery nose so now going back
in with that black eye shadow again I'm
just going to start mapping out where I
want the teeth of the skeleton to go
this doesn't have to mean need like at
all because we will be kind of like
blending and shading and everything like
that but just so you have a rough idea
of where you want to put them and I mean
it's totally up to you how many teeth
you want to do just have a play around
and I guess Halloween just have fun
you
now I'm just starting to draw the
outlines of the shapes of the teeth now
the only way I can describe the shape of
these is kind of like the top of a
bottle like it's rounded and then it
goes in and up um it's kind of hard to
describe to be honest but if you google
pictures you'll probably be able to see
or if you kind of look closely at what
I'm doing you might kind of get the idea
okay so now I am going back in with that
body shop smokey eye pencil the one I
used in my waterline earlier and I'm
just going to use this to kind of start
darkening the mouth creating more kind
of shadow so I'm really filling in the
middle of the mouth to add more depth
and then I'm going to use the pencil to
fill in between like each of the teeth
as well to add more kind of darkness and
I guess make it look more realistic
now hopefully you can kind of see what
I'm doing here but I'm using a angled
brush and that black eyeshadow again and
I'm just extending the tops of the teeth
out into the white just so the teeth
Bend really nicely into the white and
I'm also using it add more kind of
shading and that in-between the teeth
so once you're happy with that we're
going to start creating the bone
structure with the black eyeshadow again
some kind of great and I can arch and
then extending it out down the cheek and
again we're doing the same on the bottom
and joining kind of in the middle but
bringing it up the cheek down by the ear
you'll see in a second and then towards
the jaw line as well I'm really bad at
explaining things I'm really sorry just
kind of watch what I'm doing I'm just
making it seem ten times more
complicated and I promise it's not
and now for the fun part we're going to
make this look more realistic so I'm
taking this flat shader brush and some
black eyeshadow and just using that to
fill in that space oh and at this point
I also added more teeth because I wanted
the kind of smile to be longer and and
then I'm going to take the body shop
little down brush again and just start
adding a little bit of product at a time
making the darkest point kind of right
at the edge of the smile and then as you
go towards the teeth bring it in like a
gradient and then I'm going to add kind
of creases so I'm taking that little
angle brush and some black shadow and
just making little lines around the kind
of bone structure just to add more
dimension and then I kind of just start
blending a little bit of shadow down to
create again a shadow and and then I'm
going to use that same brush to outline
the kind of bone structure to make it
look I guess darker and more precise
and then we can't forget the other side
of course so I'm just going to go ahead
and repeat the exact same thing
and then I'm just taking the white
liquid liner and just putting this in
between the shadows we created to make
sure that everything is really standing
out now I'm just going to make the
attached part look more kind of shadowed
so I'm just using that black body shop
eye shadow from that palette look we've
pretty much used that over our entire
face right um so I'm just going to take
that pretty shot brush little domed one
again and just start blending that out
into the white the kind of black line we
just made just so it looks like the face
is sort of sitting on top
going back into that body shop palette
on an angled brush I'm going to take the
brown shade and I'm just going to start
creating little lines coming out of each
point of the outline just so it looks
like our skin is kind of all creased up
and then I'm going to take the white
liquid liner and next to a couple of the
brown lines we just made I'm just going
to add this to create highlighted points
and then with the bodyshop liquid liner
I'm going to add little black dots where
the kind of staple is going to attach to
so it looks like we kind of stapled the
face onto the skull so once you've done
that made two points on both the skull
part and the face part I'm going to take
the white liquid liner again and just
attach the little little staple on to
the face and as you can see like it
instantly looks like we've attached it
to our skin right and then look to
myself nails like something's missing
and then I realize I didn't put any
points at the front of my face so I'm
just making sure I do that
and then to finish off this goal look
I'm just going to apply some lash glue
into each of the teeth and then apply
some of the silver glitter on top of
that just to finish off off let us go
and then I thought hey why not do my
neck and chest as well so I used that
body shop Kajal liner to create the kind
of vertebra off her skeleton down my
neck and then I filled in all the blank
space around it with a black face paint
and some silver glitter as well and and
then at the end I put on a wig and a
headpiece to finish the look off and
that is it you guys it was actually kind
of a challenge to use the majority
makeup to do this but it was really fun
to be able to team up with the body shop
to bring you this look so I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video it was quite
a long run but it was super fun to do if
