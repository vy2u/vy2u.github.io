pretty highly requested yeah
it is a get ready with me on my makeup
and hey if the looks I'm wearing now
which is the same looks that I was
wearing in mind by a procession my
favourites which was my last video you
guys going to see this so of course I'm
still missing you this is my current
like go-to glam hair makeup look if I've
got an event if I'm going up my friends
if it's a special occasion this is what
I would do
so I hope that you guys enjoy this video
or whatsoever I do and let's get into
this get ready with me oh my god my hair
I mean that ponytails definitely seen
better so we are zoomed in a little bit
because our member would just make up
look I started with my eyes because I'm
using glitter and obviously I know it's
gone like my face some ruin my makeup
and I kind of like cut the corner will
go with it I'm just using some concealer
to prime the lids for the shadow this
one that I'm using is the LA girl Pro
conceal I like this one because I was
really good coverage so it makes them
more space you know I feel that is a
good look I actually like an alien
filling a balloon batting with our
border blender this is so strange
because I legit never do my makeup this
around but I never do my eyes first so
weird so the eye shadow is actually
pretty simple and I used to be a violet
force Holy Grail I should've had it
honestly I love this I literally just
dug my nail insert I'd let you just
started makeup store and it's already
trying me anyway it's so this is what
the action would look like if you watch
my April flash my faves you would have
seen this in there because she's been
loving it your girls in love in it well
actually start with the color called
thanks a lot a which is like a matte
off-white shade and I just used this to
set my eyelids that maybe I should have
blend nicely just pack this on home then
I took the colors called transition and
hashtag just mix them together
pack it on that brush and just work it
into the crease above the crease kind of
like our transition these eyeshadows are
pigment it is also don't worry about
being messy on this out
you can be messy is because we can clean
it up the later I mean to be honest you
just and I should have done if you
wanted I mean I would have up kind of
like this but hey do you I'm saying just
keep them in that in their arm is aching
like this is anybody else like me that I
could literally literally say I'm glad
my eye shows like an hour like you just
can't lend enough Swiss are you fixed
I took a mixture of the colors hashtag
and brownie points just to make this
kind of more dark or orange shade and
we're going to wipe that more into the
crease focusing the color directly there
I'm just going back and forth back and
forth back and forth I'm taking the same
brush W so that first color we place
down and just spinning it all together I
just make myself laugh because I sit
here and I kind of like I know what I'm
talking about when really I just put
colors on my eyes and just hope for the
best
so it is time for the best pass you
guessed it the glitter I'm sticking the
guitar with the NYX glass art primer and
I'm just going to put a little blog on
my hands something like that so just
paint it onto my lid it's kind of from
inner corner to outer I don't be too
precise with this but it went to look
like a cut crease I just want it to look
like it's burning in with the eyeshadow
and then this is the good that I use
this is the NYX face and body glitter
and of copper which hello
that's not a good looking player tapping
some into the lid is that enough then a
little bit more you never over knuckle
it up pack it on I love the glitter at
the moment it's not my safety blanket
like I'm going out and I do not show my
makeup I'm like pushing I do listen yeah
the great thing about this player
partner is sometimes I get a little
carried away I put too much glitter on I
take it a bit too high all you have to
do take a brush and just sweep it off a
bone comes right off I wish you
something like light with really hard to
work with I don't know why are you
suggesting we'd have to lay down like a
billion colors before you put clear on
for it to blend and I was just not about
that life I'm not the best at makeup so
anything easy I need really doesn't have
to be I laid down like two eyeshadow
colors and sum it up and you get a lot
of fun things are on the post now what
I'm going to do is take a wipe and just
clean up that edge just create a
straight line here
that is so satisfied now we are on to
eyelashes so I'm going to go ahead and
use false eyelashes if I can find them
now she's way wet though I'm a good Mary
before your lashes mascara does final
hop yesterday I swear any mascara will
do but I'm going to apply a quick coat
of the maybelline at the castle big soft
volume express mascara under stinger
quick coax I just want my lashes to
blend in with the full silence I've
never actually probably use this mascara
in a war it is not doing a bad job at
all to stick my lashes on I'm using the
giro lash glue this is the best eyelash
glue I've ever used in my 19 years of
being on this earth these are the only
eyelash glue that I've used it actually
keeps my lashes stock down like that
inner corner you have four about that
Luschka
if you could just get tacky please that
would be fab you start going see when
your eyelash sticks down fast time you
just know it's going to be a good safe
so my eyelashes I hope the last thing I
do is I take the ofer out six lines of
eyeliner Jo in black just run this over
my lash band just to hide any like glue
or glitter or anything nuts shoving on
that lash band
well NASA base makeup super primer I
really want to try this hourglass
available in mineral primer was really
really kindly sent this in my peer box
and I was like I gotta try it
I've heard some amazing things about
this primer so I thought perfect
opportunity
did I try too much oh gosh it's fine
we'll just keep Tunde in line don't
worry about it it's cool
fine I look like Casper the ghost for a
second there or a sink we say if I make
a little foundation cocktail today I
love good clock filming these are the
two foundations are using this makeup so
it was the L'Oreal True Match of course
when do I not use the staff then I mixed
in some of the LA GoPro coverage for
foundation let's do this just going to
paint this on my face to begin with
whenever I use this brush I genuinely
like restoring it back
remember cpanel foundation brushes like
they were things back in the day you
both know about a sponge bone like it's
the best and then Apple Uganda is the
bareMinerals best skin serum concealer
by the way this is so hydrating and has
really nice coverage I love this I use
enough on my channel where I do really
like it and everything in I try and take
the concealer like right up against that
line that we made here as well just to
make it super clean see can you go see
how good the coverages but whole Chloe
it's made my skin look as well just
consider its bomb setting it's all in
place because you know no I want so face
like down here at the end of the night
and even the Maybelline fit me maps
employers pattern oh I've been loving
this stuff I'll tell you why it sets
everything in place it doesn't look
overly matte like I can still see the
glow of my foundation stuff through this
powder which I like basically just don't
look slept with this powder and it's
look powdery or cakey or anything this
is just me all my brands I've taken
benefit hoola
just bronzed the cheeks up forehead up
attempting to make this forehead look so
much fuller I mean a guys will try right
over here start sealing going to fix
itself by matching a little bit better
now I don't know why I just looks a
little bit pasting which is weak so I
use that foundation combo all the time
but I've been obsessed with this palette
to contour with this is the nip and fab
control
in medium the reason why I love enough
is if you look all the shades they're
just super warm toned which hallelujah
of course homes just don't work with my
skin it just looks really really money
so this it was made for me going to
Mexico this one in this one just
attempting to fix that cheekbone so -
I'm using a benefit California this is
just absolutely started putting on the
apples is so funny when you apply brush
because you let you two smile at
yourselves like then for highlight has
to be an Oprah one I mean it'd be rude
not to
but normally always use a blissful which
is this one here I'm actually going to
use right now Drive today which you know
just too good
but danovich for gates to accept a
pistol I always do this now I just go to
the toilet my sponge to finish off my
eyes I'm just going to mix to give a
hashtag and brownie points again and
we're just going to whack it under here
unless you drag it down quite far I like
that kind of smokiness I don't know I
was like then mascara on those bottom
and lashes one more like the mascara
just like nope
see ya wanna run your makeup don't worry
about it holy guacamole
look how long and thick my bottom lashes
look right now like that mascara so see
you me just wanna fix up my makeup for
that mascara and I'll think that eye
makeup is a lips so I used the NYX suede
and matte lip liner in London this is my
favorite nude lip liner my marinade
yourself okay going to kind of fill my
lips in with this as well then I use
best this is the alluri or matte lip
paint in 12-8 off-white I love this
stuff so I'm going over here and then I
just like going to blend it off my
finger then I didn't have a lip gloss on
my lip gloss is partying my lip glass is
cool I don't know the word so I'm just
going to cup now this is the one I had
on so I will use it but I don't love it
it's a really really nice color it just
doesn't last that long I found myself
like but it's such a nice nude color
that I'm just like eh use anyway I just
realized didn't even show you guys what
the source which is the essence XXXL
nude lip gloss in soft almond anyone
lipstick on me this is the finished
makeup loaded this is what I had on in
my last video but now I need to do
something
so I am recreating the head I had in my
last video which was like a middle
parting sleek low ponytail other
situation I mean right now
some political Hopman so I'm basically
showing you guys how I get my hair to
look really sleek no flyaways just look
really first thing I did was I just
found my middle part which is kind of
here and then all I do now is just take
my straightener and literally just rates
in my hair this is also going to help to
sort of smooth down your hair and then
like flowing I actually just straighten
my hair like this
I never seperate or anything but
obviously if you've got to take a hair
or you just prefer to straighten your
hair in sections
feel free to I just touch do it like
this making sure I get right by my ear
here because guys under here just wear
the little curly ones like too high it
really doesn't take me that long to
straighten my hair I mean as you guys
can see I've got pretty straight hair
anyways it just looks way more smoother
on this side which what we're going for
I'm going as close to the root as I can
so I can smooth down the flowing you
guys probably wouldn't guess but slicked
hair like this where it was just like so
flat and sleek used to freak me the F
out I used to think that I had a really
round face and that it just didn't suit
me I used to hate it any time that I
would straighten my hair I'd be like
this and make it really like begum
perceive it as I used to be like flat
hair mm-hmm and now at the moment
because my saying it's just weird isn't
it how things kind of like change over
time and you like different things
anyway that was irrelevant I think the
whole point of me saying that was if you
don't feel like you see something try it
again because you never know so I just
started to have start by tucking my hair
behind my ears like there and then I
just take the back section here and I
just he there nobec so I have a little
bit of a little bit of volume at the
back now take some hairspray to seal
that in and then I just make sure it's
all nice and smooth we get the top
really nice and smooth I take my hair
spray spray the top and then I just
smooth over with my hand hopefully you
guys can see the difference between this
side and this side how much smoother
this one hooks and then it sort of
brings out all that I do is I gather all
my hair at the back use my hands to kind
of adjust the top bit here at all
hopefully you guys can see I don't
actually try dip and curl at the nape of
my neck
I go a little bit higher that tends to
suit me a little bit better
the last thing I do is because my fringe
all my bangs whatever you guys call them
and isn't quite long enough to reach
into the ponytail I just take a bobby
pin and I just flatten down the hair and
then I will like pin it but I will try
to hide as much of the bobby pin as I
can underneath the hair so this you
can't see as much so what's a good at
how I want it I'm just gonna go ahead do
a final hairspray and that is literally
how ideas have another way I'm missing
something
my hopes big the hoop the bigger the
house so this is a finished look this is
how I did my hair and makeup in my last
video prize super easy if I can do it
you guys can do it if you didn't turn
