bit different is happening with my face
right now
I have so many stressful inspired makeup
look for you but what I really wanted to
do is do something a little bit more
wearable so basically if you just took
away the grid you'll have to suck grungy
kind of edgy makeup look which honestly
is my favorite makeup look to do is that
and I'll also show you my hair so show
you how to get like these clear roots
that these herring is in everything so
yeah that's why I wanted to do if you
guys but I am so excited about this
video because I actually got to work
with benefit on this video which is
bloody amazing and what's so cool is I
have created a kind of Jordans festival
edit kind of bundle that is going to be
sold on their website so basically what
this includes is five of my favorite
like top fav benefit products I have
women aside from benefit bar these are
like my top fav you guys are going to be
able to buy this bundle and what's even
more amazing is because I love you guys
I have a 20 percent off discount code
for the bundle and you can use it on
these five products like separately as
well which ok these are my top 5
products I'm sure you have seen some of
these on my channel before so we have
the roller lash mascara the hoola
quickie con toxic benefit curb brow
eyebrow pomade the sunbeam highlighter
and going to benefit professional so
this is my little bundle I where closely
to code and all details in description
box below to check that out but without
further ado I'm going to get into this
makeup store and hair tutorial so I just
want to apologize now if you guys hear
any background noise in this video I
just had to open my window because girls
it is freaking hot in here actually hate
opening my window though because of the
bugs so if at any point in this video
you hear me scream in you know it's
because like the whole freaking cost of
all classes in Toronto and to start by
doing my brows but some of them I needed
up TLC right using a product that is in
my little benefit bundle this is their
core browser this that I've ever made if
you guys have been here a while you know
how much I love points and I love this
one I've mentioned this before in
favorite
yes twenty-four-hour and waterproof okay
better they see you if you are wondering
I am in shade 4 and this is what it
looks like like their packaging of the
honorees here and then in the slipping
just pull it out and you have a little
angle brush thank you that I just put
the brush back in a little hole we're
also related comment as well is because
it will literally last on your brows all
day and no matter what the weather
they're all circumstances my eyebrow is
staying on my face so of course I had to
have an eyebrow product in my bundle and
you guys know it was going to be a
pomade because then I say oh my breath
actually even even right now even even I
know they say I rather sisters not twins
but honestly I think these are like
distant relatives like Giudice cool that
I do I never say that is in my bundle
benefit professional I literally don't
even feel like I need to express my love
for this product because I use it so
many times when I channel before is by
far my favorite primer ever ever it
honestly just makes the most perfect
base for any card like it feels in my
pores at least my skin feeling smooth
has been makeup to last just overall in
a sub primer I literally put this
product over my entire face because I'm
like yeah I'm just going to like to run
in this product when no worries love
this stuff so much love yeah foundation
today comes with a hair currently is the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation stick
line is in y40 5 if you were wondering
it has fat coverage so we're going to
cover up everything that we need but
it's going to leave our skin really nice
injury which is exactly what I want I
want I really like fresh sunkissed glow
II look oh my god it doesn't even look
like I have a chocolate right now like
where has it gone drag it down my neck
as well you guys know the true result
now I'm taking that blue band I'm just
going to top over the top of that make
sure everything's pressed in nicely and
it wasn't an excess product all that
jazz to conceal and highlight I'm taking
at my eye makeup or concealed in the
color light ivory and I'm just going to
whack this one in the usual places
go underneath Oh No
keep aside mai-chan and a little teeny
bit more for little bit and then just
pad everything in these cover up these
bags I mean before it's like hi I've had
like three four hours sleep now like
couple like six or seven I'm going to
really really quickly just set I really
underneath my eyes to stop this from
creasing because otherwise for goon I
have like the worst creases and I just
can't get rid of them I'm using this
yellow powder as well because it's going
to keep the brightness underneath my
eyes so I set the rest of my face I want
to add some cream contour and what
better product to do that wave then the
benefit hoola kwikki contour stick this
is the easiest thing to come to your
face with if you want it like done
literally just going to add some lines
on my face where I want to contour can
even like take this down as like your
nose it creates like the perfect lines
and then look how quickly this staff
just blends out see this nose contour oh
hi but by I have used this in other
videos before and of course it is in my
a bundle as well it just asks this like
to your face mush you just can add a
little bit more hair to kind of build up
at contour because it is suitable as a
little some excellent you know whatever
you love as well as it is customizable
that you can wear this how you want how
the intensity that you like I'm using my
comfy airspun it's of course at my face
I do really like this staff sets my face
nicely and this stuff actually last me a
lifetime like that I'm saying everywhere
but like my highlight areas here because
I'm going to go in with a liquid
highlighter I do of course my set the
rest of my face so my makeup actually
last so I don't need to like contour
anything because the Quickie stick did
it for me but I do just want to add some
color to my complexion just want my skin
and all that so I'm going to take up
this one here this is doing this is nice
and sensitive this is Rosie or for
autographs look a little something like
this
I actually having quite a bit of bronze
likes to do all my skin to be nice and
full when do I not actually but like I
feel like my festival
also benefit California this is let me
see my favorite blush ever I'm going to
use this to add a little bit of color to
my cheeks slow that in there that's a
really nice flush of color but a cycle
go to it as well so my skin's are like
you know that there has to be a
highlighter in my bundle somewhere
because it just wouldn't be Jordan it's
going bundle and old Maharaja and I just
so happen to be obsessed with benefit
Sunbeam no one is really going here but
don't let that put you off because it's
more like a champagne e gold if you can
see that it's super wearable just going
to drop that onto my high point so the
cheekbones
of course tip of my nose Cupid's bow I'm
just going to take my finger to bend
this in because I'm using what I'm on I
gave me you guys see that glow I guess
just so soft and so and really like
natural hopefully the cameras pick it up
it just makes my skin look really nice
and cheery and obviously where it's a
liquid there's no glitter really already
think so it just looks super natural and
like your skin's just like it does drive
down really well it doesn't feel really
sticky but I am just an added a little
bit of how to highlight on top because I
just want to Twitter pop so I'm going to
take a little bit like a freestyle get
old chesses this is his skin frost in at
summer snow cone which is this really
pretty like old so in a couple of times
I never want to touch the J's like I
just I'm gonna ruin a teeny bit on top
yeah that's just a little bit more like
hi lovely don't have to do this a liner
benefit was enough but there is nothing
wrong with adding a little bit more glow
moving on to eyes so because I want this
to be kind of like kanji and smoky and
edgy I'm going to do some sort of like
messy carefree smoky eye yeah now so
plan I think I'm going to use my makeup
geek eyeshadows for this because they
just always have like that I'm going to
start with the color called tiki hut as
my transition color just going to buff
that into the crease a little bit
showing me guys in awesome you in
toughen up in the crease above the
crease from inner corner to outer corner
just here you go into this eye Dirk is
perfect for people like Stein out with
eyeshadow or super carefree with it
because you just just do this it's no
biggie oh my god every time I do my
eyeshadow I get out of the world getting
star on my
now you just have to be a teeny teeny
bit more precise so I'm taking a Copa
bet again from makeup geek and I'm just
going to basically put this way more
into the crease rather than like
everywhere I'm actually just adding in a
teeny bit of Morocco from makeup geek as
well just to add a little bit more warm
nothing crazy
you know I'm now taking on wolcott and
I'm just going to literally work this
all over the lid
nothing's best pop it on and rubbing
that on there and then just go in I'm
just going to keep going in until I get
the intensity that I like as well and I
just really softly blend out those edges
just bust them out to kind of Bellaire
them and that is pretty much all I do
for my kind of apart lids then for my
lower lash line I basically take them
same colors and I just bust them out
under here but I kind of put it down
quite low so I'm going to keep that kind
of grungy why I mixed into all I'm going
to mix it about maka and the rock I'm
going to start with moral code to kind
of bust out the color fast and intensify
Twister locker now for my lashes now let
me just tell you I don't need to wear
false eyelashes with this makeup look
like that is how good this mascara is
like honestly I'll just put it on and
then it speaks for itself and you'll see
exactly what I mean it is a benefit
roller lash and this is the last product
those in my bundle and holy moly
guacamole this mascara has beat anyone
I've ever used like there's a bold
statement that is freakin good I'll
apply some and hopefully your PR to see
kind of where I'm coming from this
mascara only lengthens and separates
your lashes so you look like you're
wearing sources but Alpes so much volume
without it looking clumpy of course if
you like the company look you can just
keep applying it making them sticker
adding more product and they will get
clumpy ah but it's so beautiful and you
can get your lashes as intense as you
like and it's just on it's just on the
brush has a little bit of a curve to it
as well so it really fit from your eye
shape and gets right to the base of the
lashes and really pulls them up so your
lashes look longer
another little like a trick with mascara
if you do want your lashes to look
longer if you take the brush and just
like put it on the back of your lashes
but just on the tips it just like
elongates the tips of your lashes so
make sure
I'm actually just going to go ahead and
save out over black six I died on a gel
just pop that in my waterline just to
make this look a little bit cleaner
darker so now we have the lips and then
I'm going to do the last kind of a
finishing touches so I'm going to go
with a nude
she loves the nude would you love to
confuse me since has come out I've been
wearing it non-stop it's become of my
favorite nude lipsticks this is the
jeffree star liquid lipstick in hunty
now that this is actually dried I'm
going to go with the Kiko
lip pencil in three one four it's just a
brow just going to outline my lips a bit
the law just going to outline my lips a
little bit just because I slightly
getting a little bit lost nothing I'm
just going like really light handed with
this and blending it with my finger so
now it is time for the finishing touches
so the first thing going to do is just
put in this fake nose ring because I
want this to be kind of edgy it's kind
of festively I'm going to I don't know
should I put one in I kind of feel like
it okay so there we go guys I wanted to
get my nose pierced for the longest time
I've just never had the ball so this
kind of kind of like testing laws and
then if I can actually get the wrapper
off of this thing finally we got that
this is the Alafia london wing women
felt tip eyeliner and because the felt
tip is going to give me like so much
more control so basically what I'm going
to do is create two little black dots
just underneath each eye here mmm good
do now oh I've sung my breath in and
then of course I don't feel like this
would be my festival makeup look if I
didn't took glitter somewhere on my face
these are the little puffs of glitter
that I have to choose from it's that is
blue I don't feel like that will go I'm
not going to do that one I have like
purple pink kind of lilacs with a Korean
stuff in and then silver I feel like if
you've a copy this one or the silver one
okay bye Felicia I'm selling the silver
okay I actually can't open this wine
wine ooh oh no this is my strong hand as
well I finally got the glare open I mean
as you can tell this mental situation
going on here so I'm just going to
repeat this on the side rupee okay in my
case I'm just taking some glitter glue
and placing that sauce in this area here
a little pot of glitter and just start
pressing on with my finger okay so I
think that is the makeup done all the
tests abilities how is my heart
okay so I've just split my hair straight
down the middle and now I'm going to do
is I can find it I'm going to grab this
brush and basically grab the chunk of
hair at the side of my head like this
going all the way towards the back of my
head as well and then using the brush
I'm just going to smooth out the hair to
try and get a sleek and stopped my hair
as I can and then I'm just going to take
your hair down and tie that off
I'm now going to do some kinda routes so
I'm taking that single tear that I used
on my face here and I'm basically going
to use hairspray to stick it down and
kind of spread it out you'll kind of
you'll see all that I do is I spray the
brush with hairspray and then apply the
glue to my hair like that and make sure
though that the majority of ecocide is
concentrated right at my brow and then I
use the brush to kind of just fade it
out I've got the little popsicle from
eBay by the way I will leave them a link
below and then now the last thing I'm
just taking some hair rings and trying
to hook them in down at the middle of my
party and I actually picked up these
from eBay that you get like tens like
two or three pounds it's so good I'm
like hooking one sort of the part in on
one side and hooking the other and they
should hopefully stand up when you get
the hair rings they are closed all you
need to do is just pull them open a
little bit is really really easy so
there's now like a gap and then you can
put them in just running the
straighteners over my hair now just to
make sure it's super super straight of
course I'm using my ghd's these are the
best hair straighteners you will ever
use in your life like nothing compares
to these there may be officiating in
particular which I always like the
tropic styler and it's basically meant
to have like way less damage on your
hair which color now the very last thing
promised
this is the last thing it's just going
to take a little bit of half of my
ponytail and just rub it around the hair
bands just to hide it alright this is
the completed look I really hope that
you are like in are also hope you like
