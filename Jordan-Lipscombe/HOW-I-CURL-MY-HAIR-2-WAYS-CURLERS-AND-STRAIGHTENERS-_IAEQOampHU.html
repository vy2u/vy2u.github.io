really well and having an awesome week
so far inside there I'm going to be
showing you guys how I curl my hair so
getting kind of like textured messy
loose wavy curly things in way in my
hair good I mean as you can tell my
equation is just so much I'll actually
just insert a picture here of me off the
head I'm talking about that you guys
have asked for this so much
so of course I'm doing it for you so
when I do my hair I actually switch
between two different like appliances so
I'll go between a curling wand and a
shrink now so in today's video I'm going
to show you how I do my hair with both
pretty much I guess that way if you have
one over the other kind of caters to you
and just if you want to learn a
different way I guess so let's go so I'm
starting out with my freshly blow-dried
hair this is what it looks like this is
the kind of texture that it is as you
guys can see I mean I bleached my hair
so it's got a lot of texture to it which
helps with like volume and also I've got
my thicker so so this is the kind of one
that I'm going to be using this is H
resume at 28 millimeter like barrel
curling wand
I hope you like it I feel like it's the
perfect size I like a loose messy waves
I'm gonna go ahead and brush through my
hair to get rid of any more and now all
I'm going to do a section of the top
section of hair just make it easier for
me to curl I always do this for the
carnival for some reason not sure why I
guess I just want it easier just like
that so a few things I think about one
kind of my hair the first one is
changing the direction of curls so I
want something away from my face song to
calm like towards my face just so the
cows won't cling together and is a lot
more curved texture second thing is I
like to leave the end of the hair
straight and just because adds kind of
more like looseness to the girls so the
third one is changing where I start the
cows for some I will start the roots
someone will start halfway down Vic
cetera et cetera I just take the kernel
want hold it down wrap the hair flat
around the curling warms leave a little
bit of the end out as you can see here
leave it for about like five six seconds
and then I should drop it and as you can
see you get a nice loose leaves they
take a sticker chunk of hair I'm going
to start it as you can see not right at
the roots just sort of further the way
down
curly leave the end ow five six seconds
and then let it go and then this one I'm
going to do towards my face I just do
that around this entire section
so the top section I do just slightly
differently um so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to start from the back and
work my way forward because on the top
is where I want most of the volume so
what I do is I'm going to go ahead flip
my hair forwards and then it grab a back
section I'll show you
basically every single call I do on the
top section I make sure that I curl
right from the roof just so I get this
bounce here so I get a little volume now
this is quite a big chunk of hair so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
divide it into two and I'm going to
combine this way because that's just how
my hair lips are naturally full so I'm
going to start with this bit right from
the root wrap it round leave it for a
few seconds and then you can let it go
go ahead and do the exact same thing to
this last bit this is what we had looks
like after I've finished cutting it I'm
just going to leave it for a minute or
so just to cool down you don't want to
touch the clouds until it's cooled down
always I'll start cooling in a different
position you just want to leave them so
that they last okay now that's cool all
I'm going to do is like flip my head
over and just like toss it in all
different directions and kind of run my
fingers for it roughly just to really
loosen up the curls tip my head over and
I'll just run my fingers through it
ruffle it up a little bit take it from
like side to side got me working same -
I like my hair like big and messy so if
you like that then do the step but I'm
to take my hair brush and just ever so
lightly brushing through the curls just
to like loosen them up and make my hair
a little bit more kind of like fluffy
looking and then a couple products I use
just to add some like texture into my
hair and especially when it's clean so
these are the two products I will either
go between of these are from Bed Head
and I love these both but honestly any
sort of dry shampoo or thickening
spreads to the queen for a day sticking
and spray or cease or Freight just add
more section out completely depends on
what I'm feeling that day on what I will
like use this dick and spray or sea salt
spray will add more like texture feeling
through your hair like the actual hair
will feel more what is that what does
that mean I'm not hard but you know I
mean where as I see the dry shampoo
is a lot more kind of subtle in the hair
the dry shampoo or coops or when I'm on
like to its readout or how my hair is
like this can kind of grow let's go I
usually just like flip my head and just
spray like a really small amount all
over my hair look this stuff smells
amazing so the last thing I do just add
more like oops to the hair is our just
take my brush and just gently push up on
the ends of my hair just add like loads
of volume then I'm just going to finish
off with some hairspray so this is the
Loreal Elnett this is not my favorite I
just lift and so here that is how I do
my hair with a curling wand now I'm
going to show you what I do when I use
straight that this strainer is a Nicky
Clarke one and any sort of straightening
helpful to usually the ones with the
rounded edges are the best for curls but
just a straightener and I can do it with
a straightener I don't separate my hair
I kind of just work through my hair bit
by bit
just because I like it really loose in
Merseyside not strategy the car's worst
rating as well can be a lot more defined
so I like to just sort of take chunks as
I go along pretty much I don't know it's
just what I just saw part it roughly
where I want my hair to sit I usually
will just do this at the end anyway but
I just roughly I feed it I start with a
section at the front and then what you
want to look I'm getting call once
you've brought your bitter how you weigh
what angle the straightener downwards
like this we're going right through the
hair like this and you don't know have
it like up or side raise anything the
added up the straightener is what's most
important because it will depend on how
the car comes out now having it down at
this like what degree is like 45 degrees
I don't know what will what cause there
had to be like a nice loose wave not
have too much curl to it because I don't
want like a ringlet curl that's
something really soft and like wavy so
stick by the same thing that I do when
I'm using the curling iron leave the end
out alternate the way the curls go stick
to different sizes
what of that let's go ahead twist it
back so I sort of twisted it about half
way and then just pull this through and
as you can see you got a loose weave so
I turn it like 180 degrees and then I
just go down until I reach just towards
the end and then I'll let it go it's
going to bring it this one inward so if
you're straight this like mine and
sometimes like struggles to go like
smoothly for at your hair just like open
cleaned it like this down there
you
this is what they look like with a
straightener I do not use a straightener
because you can alternate the way the
cows come out like obviously the more
you turn the straightener and like the
longer you have it in your hair for some
tighter the curls will be but see if you
have at that angle that I did I always
have the straightener pointing down and
going through it kind of quickly you'll
get this sort of loose ones again I just
did it cool and I pretty much done it
the exact same way that I appeared the
curling iron so I'm gonna go ahead and
just do that this like shaking out part
is definitely be my survival bit to my
hair like getting it so like big and
messy for sure that you can see already
I've just gone ahead and shaken the out
there look how much like bigger my hair
is it's a ceramic sticking in the spray
lifter her up with the brush and then of
course just finish with some hairspray
well if you guys are a hair touch you
like me you will appreciate this hair
because you could literally saw it in
any way that you want and it will just
naturally be able to fall like that
because obviously the curls aren't
defined or anything this is why I want
to spin it curled with a straightener I
find both methods just as easy as the
other to be honest I also think the
straightener is probably a little bit
quicker maybe because I don't section
off but even when I go for it just
depends what I'm feeling so I hope you
guys did enjoy this video and I also
hope that it was helpful enough I mean I
suck I suck I explain things I'm awful
and I'm really not the best with our
like weight comes to hair I'm kind of
clueless you guys probably think I know
what I'm doing but like deep down I'm
like so even though like saying sighs I
hope that you guys could see what I was
doing and kind of get the gist of it
so thank you guys so much for taking the
