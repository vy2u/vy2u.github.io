really well and having an awesome week
so if you're new here hi I promise
I don't normally sound like this I'm
currently really ill and suffering from
the sorest so as I like genuinely feels
like forever a today so I am so excited
for today's video because we are going
to be talking all things fashion and
clayed in which like my my favorite
things ever now I was just going to do a
normal home video bye for I wanna switch
out and give you guys something that's
hopefully more helpful to you and also
giving you guys my personal little tips
and tricks I've learned along the way so
you can find your own personal style now
let me just say I am no expert by any
means
I just think fashion is fun there are no
rules to it and also you guys ask me so
many questions all the time about my
clothing how I like style things so this
is thingy so if you guys want to know
ways that you can find your own inner
fashionista keep watchin ok
so tip number one that I have for you
guys is something that I like to call
having your own style spirit I pretty
much what that means is having somebody
or a couple of people that give you the
feels when it comes to fashion like the
people that inspire you and you look up
to when it comes to fashion
so someone for me personally is Sara
Ashcraft you probably all know her I
love her literally everything she wears
I'm like I need it so this is our blog
here if you don't know who she is she's
basically just a social media girl and
everything she wears I Lachie I mean I
love it and then this is our Instagram I
use this the most like fine summer
fashion inspiration was really cool as
well as usually tags where her clothes
and pieces are from so you can find them
easily I don't know it's just a great
way to get inspired I just think having
someone you look up to fashion wise
gives you a ton of inspiration it
doesn't mean to copy them all it means
is taking aspects of what they wear and
making your own so have a few shops that
you person loves that may love pretty
little thing I also love misguided
boohoo they're just a few that I
personally are obsessed with now this
tip is basically take advantage of the
tabs you use the tabs at the top here I
know it sounds so obvious but you can
find some good inspiration and clothing
items with these most website sounds
like a new in section now if there's a
current trend that you are obsessed with
check out the new in section
because you'll find a bunch of like
current trends on here so of course is
like jump addresses I know they're
really in at the moment t-shirt just is
here there's also no ripped clothing
there's just a bunch of stuff but
another really good place to find
inspiration is in the clothing section
you should be able to find a bunch of
category select there's like loungewear
party sharp the basic celebs style still
a really good one if they have it is the
shop Instagram page so it just opens up
it is very own Instagram as you can see
they style the outfits together so you
can actually find like an entire outfit
here which i think is a really cool idea
which is online popular clothing
websites will have these categories so
definitely use them like it's around the
website and you're struggling to find
clothes and pieces that you like or you
just lack inspiration go in the little
sections and you'll definitely be able
to find like outfits that they put
together and that's another thing take
notes as to what the models are wearing
so if there's like a skirt that you like
and you're not sure what top you could
pair with it look at what they are
wearing because usually obviously they
put outfits together that can always
help okay so we are now onto the
starting part of this video which I'm
sure is a bit that you guys or wanted to
say so deserved if I have is take pieces
of clothing from different styles that
you passing loves and just make it your
own so first thing I'm going to show you
guys uni high boots
I love knee-high boots I want to see I
think they just make any outfit look so
extra so just excuse this set up you can
see my lights and stuff I have to move
my mirrors you guys completely outfits a
little bit better so yeah this is one
way that I would sell knee-high boots my
knee high boots here from booties are
just like open-toed ones honestly love
these so so comfortable and then the
jumper dress I'm wearing is from the
leap clothing I think I honestly love
John for dresses with knee-high boots
like jump dresses t-shirt dresses
honestly my kind of style and then I
just paid it with an oversized anemic
jacket which is from Topshop
so yeah this is one outfit or even more
just like a casual vibe all that I've
done is tied a check shirt around my
waist this one in particular is from
boohoo so same boots same jumper dress
all that I've done is tied around my
waist so easy way to switch up some
outfit it looks like a completely
different outfit but really it's not
I've just put this from my wrist and
then another way I love the Sony highs
is with jeans but this is more
take a look but you're still kind of
made an effort you know so I boot a
still bbc1 my jeans are these
high-waisted blue ones from fashion over
I think the top is also from fashion
over and this like furry fro over coal
is from Anacin no yeah this is the next
style I also think adding texture to the
outfits that add in the fur really like
brings the outfit together as well the
texture when it comes to clothing I
think it's like a huge a huge thing yeah
this is just another way that I like to
style you know the next sort of trends
that I have to share with you guys on
how I like stardom is fishnet tights
they are like the recent thing
everyone's been wearing them and I'm
going to show you how I would style them
so this is the first outfit that I have
to share with you guys I'll start from
the bottom I guess so my boots are sock
boots from public desire and my fishnet
are these are the larger whole fishnet
tights you can get smaller ones but I
preferred the larger ones they are from
- whoo my t-shirt dress is from pretty
little thing I just tied it on or not at
the side and then my third rack is the
same one from the last outfits from
images you can of course style it
however you want but yeah this is just
one idea that I have so this is the next
way of styling fishnet tights I have to
show you guys can we please just say hi
so I make in a grunge side because she's
out I'm like that though like I'll wake
up and just go with however I'm feeling
like I wake up in the gurney one day and
the next sabe like their psyche there
are no rules there's no excircles of
what you should be in need are just do
you sew the shoes aren't bands I'm sure
you all know that honestly you're going
to see these as a crap-ton in this video
because these are by following the best
shoes ever so comfortable then I have of
course on the same black fishnet tights
from the zoo too and then this pops I'm
wearing is actually from H&amp;amp;M
pretty sure US of heartache yeah I
honestly love it so nice and then the
black bean shorts I have on underneath
I'm pretty sure the from Primark I've
got them on just because this is just a
longshot be nice so what my um got like
tushy hang out or anything
so this one is more like a casual
everyday where honestly so comfortable
but you have to edgy at the same time
and so this way of styling fishnets is
something a little bit more subtle so if
you're not confident enough to wear them
underneath a dress and be like as in
your face and this way perfect so you
could style them underneath some ripped
jeans so as you guys can see you can
actually see the fishnets just like
peeping through the holes here and there
also peeping at the top of the jeans
here as well okay so my boots are from
boohoo honestly if you're looking for a
new everyday boot I would highly
recommend these because you get the
height but they're so comfortable jeans
are also from blue too and then on the
top I'm just going like a Calvin Klein
Parana thing and then this jump is from
Urban Outfitters fun fact it wasn't
actually cropped I decided to crop it so
like suit my star mole which will be a
tip coming up but and there is actually
a hood as well so the last kind of trend
I'm going to share with you guys to open
up in is of course chokers honestly seen
them everywhere specially these kind of
diamonds runs I love it it literally
makes any outfit look glam instantly
like look at this one so I've put the
choker with this jumpsuit from opale
honestly kind of obsessed with their
chokers honestly go with anything and
everything like whether you're wearing
something more casual whether you're
wearing something more dressy I just had
it with this to show you guys something
different and honestly you can wear it
with anything there goes everything
personally myself I love pairing them
with like the lower cut things or like
off the shoulder and go style tops this
is completely up to you so this is what
I mean by like a bandeau style thing I
feel like the truth could just add
something to like the top half of your
body if that makes sense Bruce is quite
like a blank space by the way this two
piece is from Sasha Nova if I get close
hope for you be able to see it's like
suede so good olive suede color no need
I personally think that triggers add a
little something to any outfit so sup to
you you are literally whatever you feel
comfortable in this next one is all
about being comfortable now fashion of
course is fun and you can experiment
with everything but always wear what you
feel comfortable because when you feel
comfortable you feel confident
about what are your staples in your
wardrobe so when you open your wardrobe
what do you see most of or when you're
out shopping what kind of clothing to
you gravitate towards more so for me
personally basics I can't get enough of
basics I think that they go with
everything they're easy to style and you
can they are and our textures and colors
and staff to make basics looks not basic
ok so here's an example of like a basic
I say basic like because although it
means it's like they're playing pieces
of clothing but once you put them all
together something looks that they say
if this is literally my wardrobe at the
moment like all in one like cropped
hoodies bomber jackets black jeans and
vans like this is me success by the way
my glasses are from a sauce is cropped
green hoodie and the silver bomber
jacket are both from new look the clip
section as well and then of course I'm
just wearing any old black jeans and
then at my fans so so comfortable and
this is what the green cropped hoodie
looks like by the way I just took off my
coat to show you and then at the back it
does have and it will hurt as well I
also love wearing caps as well this
particular one is from boohoo it's meant
to be beige but it's literally green so
I don't I don't know about that but and
then the last thing is don't be afraid
to DIY your own clothes you know create
them into something that you would
person like to wear so for example
sometimes I buy things letting hmm I
wish that was cropped or I wish I had
this to it or whatever so for example
that Urban Outfitters chopper I showed
you earlier I literally went at it with
a pair of scissors and just cut straight
through it to make it more of a crop
jumper because I prefer that look on me
you're supposed to like the long jumpers
I've also cut holes in jeans before to
make them into Ricci and so I just cut
lines in them with scissors and then I
washed them and then when you wash them
the frayed bits come out so you look
more distressed which is like turning my
style so never be afraid to customize
clothing it to suit you if you guys do
on a video for me on how I personally
customized my Clavin then let me know it
might be bigger tip I have for you guys
is always wear what you feel comfortable
in because when you feel comfortable you
can literally rock anything and up when
you feel at your best fashion is so cool
because it's literally a way that you
can speak about your personality without
even having fair word you know
you guys enjoy this video and can take
something from it even if you don't have
the same style to me some of you are
probably watching it like like she don't
like what you're wearing which is
totally normal because we're all
different I at least hope that you're
able to take my tips and put it into
your own like a fashion sense you know
it was so fun to film it's definitely
something different from my channel
we've never done anything like that
before so if you did enjoy it them to
