with another haul I know but this isn't
just any old haul oh no this is a Black
Friday haul all our shop elects we all
have Black Friday let's be real all
you're gonna say is a hyper comfy
because this is gonna be along what's
really vehicles coming the miles around
this time of year like Black Friday and
stuff they have some really when you get
sales so no self I'm gonna share with
you bits from pretty little thing miss
Pat boohoo and in the style so
everything I think so they were try not
to talk too much you know pick up the
pace a little bit so we can get for
everything but like this is me and I
like to talk for England so I'm elite
release tomorrow my clothes right now
I'm okay with that but yeah I let's just
doing this with there's so much stuff
and I don't want us to be sitting here
till next year starting with Miss Pat on
my fave fave places anyway the first
thing from miss pop I have here is this
jumper dress so I mean instantly Gucci
look-alike I love the colors I love the
white with like the pop of color just a
white jumper dress with the green and
red stripes going throughout the middle
and on the sleeves as well I got any
size at 10 which I normally wouldn't do
buy quite oh the fact he gives me a bit
more like comfy nurse in a bit more room
you know the plus side to this you guys
it isn't safe ooh we all know how it is
on this channel finding white things
that aren't see-through is literally a
mission for wherever see is more for
jump right it's a really really nice and
material I love this soft stuff for
winter cuz you know sometimes you don't
want to be covered up like head to toe
so you know you've got to be a leg your
own show not mad at it look like the top
coming up put a nice big coat over this
good to go yeah that's that little gem I
will have causing everything link below
so if you want to know pricing and
everything like that check the
description box you guys know next
things I feel like this is gonna be a
love it or hate it kind of I am but
style dry I think these will look so
cool they are basically wet look
leggings pretty much I'm gonna like try
my best to put them off no promises but
you go up and try they fit like a glove
and what I really really like as well is
they're super comfortable because they
have stretched for them this times like
a white knit jumper I thought it would
be
vibe but hopefully you guys can see that
stretch can you see that I thought
people look at this movie like just
because it is kind of more daring a
little bit more out there but I feel
like this can be told I've got any
clothing item to be honest can be
totally wearable it's just how that I
hope you like I'm a stylist what's nice
if I get these in I've got them in Annie
I am a size 8 so it it sticks my sides
I'm so excited to give these a go like
so excited never be scared with like
clothing and fashion and style and stuff
you guys because at the end of the day
it comes off it's like makeup isn't it
you'll never know until you try
inspirational quite of the day so this
kind of jumper from Miss puck here is
the kind of jumpers I could see of them
leggins it's just this white knitted
jumper bar at the front it has like a
twist I'm gonna do it like no favors
holding out but basically like wraps
over at the front is longer at the back
I don't know it's just not like your
standard niche number you know we're
switch you know out with icing uh
anything knitwear around this time of
year it's gonna keep you warm which is
fab because like I said in my last haul
guess like - I been here and it's really
nice chunky near white which means it's
gonna go with a lot of stuff I've got it
in a size small to medium as well and it
fits perfectly something a little bit
different I don't have anything like it
in my wardrobe and why are you like it
is I've got loads of jumpers do you know
what I mean let's be honest around this
time of year where like jumper cray but
I just don't want the same thing all the
time you know it was like I get a bit
bored so if this is like I'm a jumper
it's cute right I like it a lot speaking
of keeping warm this coat is kind of
everything I'm gonna be honest with you
guys I'm not normally a like I mean I
like pink but I'm not really a pink
clothing where iconic oh I don't think
that was even English but this car this
car it is so damn cute is a pink kind of
long line fur coat that's all much sheep
they're not real sheep of course it's
called a teddy coat I'm literally gonna
feel like a teddy in this now this sort
of material that like bobbly
sort of sheepy material she is not
normally the softest but this one
game-changer this one is so it's soft
even my dad fell in he was like I love
it I think it's gonna add that little
pop of color to your outfit it's gonna
keep you super super warm I feel like
this with a skirt a little crop top and
maybe some chunky boots would be such a
vibe I don't have
unfortunately but I feel like this with
a pink sky you know kind of making it
like a cobalt it really really far but
for a coat that's really really good
quality I'm pretty sure it wasn't even
that expensive either which and we Black
Friday sales saving them quoits
I love it I'm so excited for it I was
just excited for everything I'm just
excited okay like let's be real here
would this be a jordan lipscomb clothing
haul without a little bit of camo in it
I'm actually obsessed I don't think I've
done a whole recently that hasn't had
camo in its the problem but miss pepper
do these ones and I don't have any in
this color so I feel like it was so fine
how cool are these these are so funky
green orange and black come open
trousers the best part about these is
these are more actual like a tracksuit
bottom trousers so they're super super
comfortable but they don't really look
like tracksuit bottoms you could totally
wear these out I feel like this with a
little black top or even an orange top
would look so cute they do of course
have this drawstring waistband as well
so you know you can pinch that waist in
which is really really nice because then
it's totally flattering on your figure
they fit really nice you know they've
still got a bit of like looseness to
them so they're not as fitted but they
still flat your figure which is amazing
that's what we all want because you know
we want to look kind of like chill and
cool you know with looser bottoms and
stuff but we don't need to like not be
flowering otherwise we're just gonna
look come on like a pencil but these
ones are super super flare in really
really comfortable you just can't go
wrong I've got them in a small I believe
yeah a small I love myself some cowboy
trousers I let you have them in green
red now this color I'm actually wearing
camo right now would you believe it a
couple things left from Miss pop now
next thing is a little skirt I mean look
at that color it looks a bit more red on
camera it's more like that orange II
kind of color a line skirt with this
like black panel down the side with
little poppers that do actually you know
pop open which I actually really really
like sometimes it's nice to undo the
last sort of couple poppers to kind of
create look at the other slit in your
stuff I don't know if you want to make
more Lego and show it gives you that
option for you to do that it's a really
really nice material super super
lightweight I had it in loads of other
colors as well I went for the orange
because I don't have an orange to go
what size did I get you in a size 8
stuck to my size and it is a teeny teeny
teeny teeny teeny bit too big around my
waist
nothing crazy I think cuz I like to wear
things super high-waisted that sometimes
it's like Jordan just just put it down a
bit nothing wrong with having a
bit of color to your wardrobe a little
place ooh
so first off it's in this amazing like
Louie gray valve there and I've said
this so many times on my channel but
fella I think makes things look way more
expensive so it looks like this it
crosses over at the front into little
shorts and then the sleeves are really
cute they have little bows that they all
picks up my hair as well they're little
bows at the bottom and then there's
little slit well that's a pretty big
slit ordered but yeah they're slits on
each arm
you can totally dress it up dress this
down you know put a denim jacket with it
for the daytime and then maybe put on
some heels and like a leather jacket or
something for the evening done play
suits are so fab you put them on and
you're like it good to go yeah and
low-key this is like perfect for this
time of year you know things that party
season like as much as I love my brights
you know their pops of colors I have
been loving like navies and grays and
blacks you know like darker colors I
feel like that's just me going it's like
winter mode like everything dark like
every sure it sucks my size with this
yet I got a size 8 hey I don't know why
I said that so like hey next clothing
brand no you know it was gonna come you
know it was gonna come pretty little
thing it's close to my heart
first thing from them is another little
knit what item to show you but again
it's something a little bit different
this is definitely more of that like
cream ivory kind of color so it has a
roll neck that's a wrong neck neck nice
little crop you know with us on a
crochet detailing and knitwear can I
situation and then on the sleeves it has
these little like frilly I don't even
know like justice frilly okay I've
already planned this outfit this with a
black leather skirt give it to me I've
got it in a size 8 and I love how it has
that natural sort of like oversized
fit to it it's just something really
cash and because it has these sort of
added bits on it as well it looks like
you put way more and then you did really
we just chucked on a chunky knit like I
said chunky knits around this time of
year you just can't go wrong oh my god
I'm gonna be so snug snug as a bug in a
rug
seeing as are some pretty little thing I
thought I have to try out something from
the Kourtney Kardashian collection like
how could I not these trousers you've
probably seen them on there they are
actually a little coward I really really
wanted the little top that went with it
but they didn't have my size in there
they were completely out of stock
so I thought you know what I'll ask for
the trousers and then I can get like the
crop top another time they have this
amaze
print on like look at these
I actually am obsessed I'm on the top so
far if they are flared trousers this
amazing like soft velvet material I've
got these in a 6 they are so flattering
they fit perfectly around my waist
really really nicely around my bum and
then they sort of go down and just flare
out only thing little thing about these
they are so long like to the point where
I'm like does anybody in this entire
universe have legs this long because
like look guy is you can kind of tell
just from your holding up I don't think
I've ever seen translates this long even
when I stand on my tiptoes and you know
I can pretend I've got heels on still
too long I don't really know I think I'm
gonna have to like take them up see if I
can solve take them up somehow because I
really really want to wear these I
really love them the colors and
everything about it just makes floral
really wearable I'm not really like a
floral kind of gal you know but these
weren't a new level so I'm gonna have to
find a way to do it my mom will probably
know did you see the label then it just
like went flying my mom were probably
know what to do get mama Lipscomb to
help me and then the other Kourtney
Kardashian thing I've got was the
oversized like shirt dress I got it in
black she did have it in this amazing
like pink as well but no it's just sort
of like safe for me surprisingly this is
actually a lot longer than I thought
it'd be but I love the way she started
she had this off bell round the waist
which is exactly how I'm gonna style it
the good thing about it being long
though is you can kind of like customize
the length with a belt which is that it
basically just is a black satin
long-sleeved shirt dress there's not
much more to say about it really it is
really really well made though I've got
it in a size a I probably could have
even got a size 6 to be honest but I
still really really liked it
I actually love shirt dresses there's
such an easy piece to style but can just
look so cool I think I've said that wide
about 20 million times in this video but
I just my vocab really just can't
stretch out right now I've been eyeing
this little body suit up and pretty I
think is so long now and I think you
know what just gonna do it how cute is
this a she looks tiny on camera it does
fit little cami shaped a bullish to love
the square neckline I think are so
flowering and really really
just has pretty little thing well PLT
written all over it
just navy blue and white this is so
simple but so effective with skirts
jeans trousers literally anything
anything will go with this piece which I
love it's so handy to have super
versatile pieces in your wardrobe
because then you know you'll get like a
lot of wear out there I've got it in a
size a I always do with my body suits
you guys know I don't want the whole
like double bum cheek thingy going on
also just you know it is a little popper
what do you see well I've had body suits
in the past right guys that don't open
up I've had to do that whole right pull
to the side situation nearly peed on
myself and it was in a club as well that
wasn't cute this is another little thing
that I've been eyeing up for the longest
time do you know that's the fun thing
about Black Friday anything that you've
been eyeing up now's your time to get it
another little jacket but it is
different because it is more over crops
pretty bloody soft I can tell you that I
love how it's cropped I loved crop
things I think it's really like
flattering on like my shape but has I
heard as well which i think is so
adorable it's 32 which means it kind of
adds a bit of like extra Ness to you
anyway I love the way this feels I love
the way this fits I love the way it
looks I just love everything about it
they had it in loads of other colors as
well the one I can remember his baby
blue which I was quite enough as well I
really like that one but I went with
black I low-key slush hike you don't
want to take this off now too hot right
now when you have like two huge stuff
but lights in front of you oh another
little sat in peace and now there's
quite a bit of Sun in this video how
many two more pieces after this I stand
I think I obviously don't ever realize
until it all gets her number oh did I
really order that much of the same
material I don't know anyway the reason
why I picked up this white satin shirt
was because there was a model on there
she was wearing these whites of wide leg
trousers with this and it looked so good
it's like smart but like cash I don't
know I love the fact that it's white it
would go with everything I love the fact
is satin as well because it doesn't look
like a school shirt or even just like a
work shirt I don't know it just has more
of a different kind of vibe to it and
got in as small as well obviously if you
want it way more oversized than size up
but this is more like that's or likely
loose but more fitted kind of look this
was definitely more that likes funny
last-minute thing you know what you see
any like do I get it
do I not and then the model just like
maybe want to get it you ever have that
when the models on the website sometimes
make you buy things literally me all the
time moving on up to another brand now
we are gonna do in the style again at
one of my other favorites I've just
realized you're probably gonna look at
these and think they look really similar
to the corny Kardashian ones Jordan yeah
and i'm a floral pair of trousers but
these are different i promise first off
the material it's totally different this
is definitely more of that just like
chiffon e material and these are way
more of just like wide leg trousers
which I'm obsessed with I love wide leg
trousers oh my god you know what's even
better
they actually have pockets that's just
like made my entire day now it actually
size down with wide leg trousers because
I know they're gonna naturally be bigger
and obviously I still want them to kind
of look flattering on me these are
really nice if I can elasticated back so
you know they like kind of like they do
that
do you like the elastic thing around
your waist they do also sort of like
give you you know a little bit of bump
shape I always see trousers like this
it's a really really nice evening piece
especially when it comes to this time of
year you know you don't always want to
be wearing like a little dress with like
everything on the show sometimes you do
want to be like a little bit more
covered up so I think this off vibe is
perfect and you might be thinking Jordan
isn't this more like a summery piece
like girl you wear whatever the hell you
want when you want these are actually
from the Philly fares collection as well
a lot of this stuff is actually like
celebs or influencers collections which
is really really nice showing you know
my love and support I feel like the next
place I have to show you are from the
tummy hem brow and that's how you say
her name little collection that she has
just come out with kind of dying over
them she's actually done some really
really nice at pieces I have two little
kind of cords here the first card I have
is that color I love this kind of
champagne e gold I guess I'm like
passion oh like yes
surprise surprise wide leg trousers okay
honestly I never realized until I sit
down and I'm like you've got this many
powerful our neck trousers this much
that and stuff this I have no words
I'm like the Mad Ants penis because
these are hella cute but the bottoms in
a size six like I said always always do
and I'm so so good
I did they fit like a dream it's just
like a little band Oh talk what I really
like if she's / little rubber ice band
at the top so you know or last people if
not the biggest boobs in the world put
your hands up this will help to keep
this up cuz you know we haven't really
got boobs to help keep up sorry the
rubber it's our best friend I did get an
8 though in the top just you know it
fits like wideness wise the other thing
I got from her is another Saturn thing
these though are totally different
material they feel a lot lot heavier and
they have a bit more like stretch to
them as well ok so my camera just
decided to like die on me thanks camera
yeah I got a six in these but they are a
lot more fitted then the like champagne
e ones there tie around my waist on my
bum and then as they passed my thighs
they get like looser if that makes sense
but it does come with a little top it
does come with this little bralette top
as well kind of like a little bow in the
middle and then the trousers have that
sort of design as well I love the way
that this looks I love the fact that the
trousers are again really really high
waisted so you know you have a little
top so you saw too much going on but
there's a little bit of something going
on you feel me
super super happy with these pieces
again it's the perfect time of year for
stuff like this Christmas season party
season has come in we are onto at the
very last place of boohoo I'm gonna make
switch out real quick and show you a
pair of shoes look at these boots do you
not just love them what really attracted
me to these boots with this sort of like
gradient Hill here like this or chunky
heel is a suede sock boot I love sock
boots
surprisingly they are really really
comfortable I think it's super super
hard to find sock boots that are really
comfortable these are they're just
looking a little bit different like I've
not seen shoes with this sort of like
heel before it's really edgy they are
true to size minor 5 and they fit fab it
oh my god this dress in the light how
amazing is that I actually just can't
stop looking at in the viewfinder that
is insane woohoo
I see so she's a little strapping v-neck
fron bodycon dress as you can see
totally sparkly it's hope you like lamb
there actually look like sequins and
then obviously when the light reflects
off it looks bomb yes she sound like
Christmas this is sorry what's so nice I
actually like I think this might be my
Christmas outfit
don't even know so I got this in a 8 but
I didn't realize this is actually from
the petite section so it is a little bit
short there's no like thumb shots or
anything but it is just that sort of you
know you kind of have to watch here if
you're out dancing and stuff which can
be a little bit annoying but when the
dress looks this good I don't even think
I really care you know when you're just
like right I'm going to risk it for
chalky discs because that that is fire
that is so nice they even have a version
that's not petite I don't know I didn't
mean to get a petite one so that's the
first dress and then the next dress is
in this color which I have been up with
us or like burgundy oh it's off the
shoulder what a surprise a little body
con mini a dress long-sleeved off the
shoulder has this little v-neck little
Kyle so I'm a little bit sexy this is
really really good quality has a nice
structure on the shoulders you know it's
gonna like stay there it's not gonna
ping all about the place severe the
front is actually wide so it's gonna
like keep its shape it's in this amazing
velvet but it has a bit of stretch to it
it's just really really comfortable they
had it in other colors as well I got a
very kind of wine color because it stood
out to me the most again a perfect
little pony dress last two things now so
the first one is a coat another one
another one another longline coat which
is surprising for me you should have a
cropped conic elbow I've been whipping
out this or longer coats I think as
these are coats I wear with like dresses
and stuff you know to sort of like match
up anyway it's a really really soft
short kind of faux fur gray bluey kind
of jacket they call it charcoal that's
pretty better way to describe actually
they're like bluey gray but around the
waist it has these little bits here
which you can like pull in and sort of
customize the shape around you if you
want to has a hood as well there's not
really too much else to say about it
really you can't really go wrong with a
bit of fur inner and a coat this was
actually from the petite section again
it's not petite though I got it in a
size a and I love this my mum is even
like eyeing up this coat she said this
is her favorite one out of all of them
so mom if my coat is missing a know
where it is Jake hey babes you come for
it and then the last thing would you
look at that
hello again this is basically like a
sawed-off shotty
situation right this one looks so cool
it's not like a band t-shirt dress or
just like bounty and ripped jeans I got
this in a medium session large by the
way just had a bit more sort of like
give to it because I like Jackson stuff
to have that sort of like oversized feel
it's just like a shirt jacket II like a
jacket II am i alright you know the
things of material but it's just a
really good thing to just kind of like
fro over out the door and we all know
camo makes everything better right
there's definitely lazy out there like
oh no I have finally shown you guys
everything we have got through this if
you've made it to the end of the video

little bit of inspiration on what you
