shop called I throats I smell they are a
online clothing website and they're
brand new here in the UK I'm pretty sure
that they can do by but they've moved
over to the UK which is also me if you
follow me on my social medias which if
you don't trust me should i OS you I'd
be far with I saw it fast they had their
like launch thing there so thank you so
much for access for inviting me taking
me along so call and it's excited to see
a new clothing brand come out because
it's a bit of me their clothes or a bit
of me so I Glee excited let's do this
I'm going to quit it with the intro and
actually we want to show you guys you
see this is a try and haul as well
because they're the best icing
personally so let's keep it rolling I
don't actually have a dressed as this
style so I'm florists you know you go
stretch it out it is just black body
corner like mini dress there's like a
v-shape front and then it basically
looks like the flees climate like it's a
cape that goes over you the dress just
hugs you really really nicely fits
perfectly the v-neck comes down to a
nice place where you know you get a
little bit of cleavage but it's nothing
too like in-your-face and the skirt
comes to a really nice length as well as
not too short not too long it's just
perfect because this is body corner I
did stick to my size which is a size 8
and it was 20 pounds which is really
really good by the way their prices are
also super super affordable I thought
that kind of boohoo prices very good you
guys know I'm going to be rocking this
on a night out soon oh yeah oh the next
thing is back as well but don't worry
not everything in this all in fact there
is some color
is this pair of black wide leg trousers
all the way down oh my god they went on
forever then I was like wealthy and
these look so blond if you have me on
Instagram there's a picture of me and
Hanna Rene Hanna Rene I love you go my
sister from another mister I'm wearing
means in that picture and these make
your butt look so good considering
they're like wide leg trousers you still
make your ballet pop in but you know I'm
sure we don't all might have in a bit of
us some you know I'm just in love with a
set of these they hug you rather way to
make your butt look good snare around
the leg ah everything that you would
expect from wide leg trousers you get in
these I have them in a size 8 and guys
these are only 12 pounds 12 pounds like
us ridiculously affordable I'm living it
I now have this adorable little
off-the-shoulder number so it's just a
little off the shoulder y crop top and
then down the front you kind of have
these like satin borders and then it's
like a lace-up thinking then they're
these little sleeves attached what do
you really like about it is you can
still wear a bra with it if you want to
even though the lace-up it goes all the
way down you can pull the lace up it's
so tight that you know your bra be
hidden so if you are a bit insecure
about I'm not wearing a bra
you can forgive you all right with this
but if you're like me and you don't mind
three minutes once in a while you can
like not wear a bra and your boobs are
like inflation I was like grabbing my
boobs okay I know you guys know what I
mean it does also come in a couple of
other colors as well I think it's a
grimace car key and a pink which is
really cute I'm going to rest of the way
classic mindset size eight and again
this is 12 pounds can't complain
she shoots she scores whoo I'm actually
so great okay next item is this adorbs
little dress so if this movie pink color
color is a mini dress as you can see at
the front oh I got twisted there's just
this ruching all up the front is a
bodycon dress as well and as I said that
but yet body column is just so cute
but the only thing that I'm a little bit
like about this a little bit fee for its
opinion it's see-through all that I do
to make it work is I put it all to me
like to slip dressing on
nice and it's fine like you can still
wear this you guys know I keep it real
with you I wanted to let you know
because I don't want any of you to buy
something and then think this is the
fruit but nobody mentioned it was
see-through so I wanted to let you know
but just put on it it will tiny toes
underneath and you're good to go so this
is a size eight again and it is 15
pounds on the website I really want to
show you those issues so cool that's so
me they are these like platform sandal
kind of shoes one of those didn't do me
sandals please tell me you guys have
seen that video when he's like they're
my singles I put them in my pocket he's
so cute in that video
anyway austrack how cute are these so
they have a little strap that goes
around your ankle as well I think these
were spiked a pair of jean shorts and a
top would look so cool in the summer I
love them
I love the fact as well they have this
like rope detail that goes all the way
around a sandal itself I'm a size 5 by
the way in shoes and these are totally
true to size they were a little bit more
in the pricier side though this is one
of those items that were an overpriced
they were 30 pounds but they're so worth
it cuz I know I'm gonna get so much wear
out of these because you can dress them
up dress them down because they're
platforms this next thing well a little
bit sexy I'm not going to lies if you're
feeling a little bit more maybe one
night you can probably see already why
this is a little bit sexy but it is just
this plunge neck sheer kind of mesh
paneling 40 soon you can see the back
has like this crossover detail here on
the sleeve are so cute like look they
flirt out I love a good first leave oh
this is one of those items as well that
will legit look good with anything with
a pair of jeans with a skirt shorts
anything this is a little bit harder to
style because of course it is like sheer
mesh paneling and company we're abroad
with it because it's like backless it
plunges down but I think if you just get
some little nipple covers or some lycra
stick on cups or something you will
literally be fine when I first saw this
I thought that is hot like I'm not
thinking my sexy on for this try to get
my sexy on my sister don't worry it's
like sexy but I'm still a lady at the
same time you know I always always get
my size in a body suit so it's not too
tight around my like arm when you clip
it together I'm at so I've got size 8
and this was 15 pounds as bar on the
whole kind of
shir clothing thing I have this to show
you but don't worry nothing is on show
with this because it's a kimono it's
cool although it's it's black sheer
kimono it goes all the way down to the
floor and then you have long sleeves
with it as well when I went to Ibiza
with them I wore the white version
obviously but the blue swimming costume
that I had on I think I considered on my
Instagram sorry what pre so I was ok I
need the black coin this is so easy to
throw on with anything bikinis swimming
costumes shorts and a top a dress it
just makes anything looks a little bit
extra like long and flowy and it's just
like I don't really know how if I can
explain it but it's fab and I've got in
a size 8 and it's only 12 pounds ok so I
love this little top it's off the
shoulder like numerous things in this
video you're going to see a couple more
off the shoulder things because I'm
obsessed you know has a lace up front
and look at the sleeves they're like
these puffy puffy things red and white
pinstripe situation this is so cute
I feel like I've said cute wait a minute
under this video but everything's cute
these are really cool as well because
they're like tight around your arms so
you don't worry about it falling down or
anything the front is like laced up and
you can pull that as tight as you want
as well you know show a bit of
something-something maybe not up to you
I don't know why I just look at this top
and I think summer like look at those
top makes me happy no this is actually a
size 10 I thought it was an 8 if the 10
it still fits though I can't find this
right now the website tell you the price
but everything will be linked in the
description box anyway check it out
get that a click everything will be ok
holding this up on a few does is no
favors it looks like the arms like made
out of tissue or something's like it's
like a standard sort of next top but
this leaves are attached on to the off
the shoulder the arms are like puffy
this is good starter some black or blue
jeans or even like a pair of shorts
because it kind of is long enough to
hide the short so it looks like you're
wearing like a little dress top this top
sizing is ittle bit differently are
those from silver being much 6 8 10 12
it's actually like small medium large
this is a medium because I wanted it to
be kind of like flowy and this was 20
pounds I have another dress you guys and
it's in this amazing
mustard color switches his satin dress
comes down like a v-neck sort of thing
and then it's all flows out I love the
fact that it's satin I love that
material the back does have this like
elastic waistband bit but it does come
with a side you can tie around your race
where you bring you in to give it a
little bit more shape this to me is that
perfect summer dress evening dress
because it's flowy and airy it's satin
so it looks even more expensive than
what it is definitely stick to your size
I've got a size 8 because you can't
actually adjust the straps so they are
sort of what they are by is a really
dress I now have a bikini to share with
you guys that I could have ever showed
you a bikini I've shown like swimming
costume been all over Keaney I love the
whole vibe of this one it's like crochet
festively bohemian a so yeah it's
triangle-shaped top what's really cool
though is there's actually little gaps
where you can put like little cynics or
anything in there if you want to make
your boobs a little bit more perks it
ties up around your neck like a halter
neck and then of course forever and your
baton of these are the bottom tiers
they're a little bit different to the
top but all the pattern that goes around
to the top is the pattern that's on at
the bottom so of course they do match
there's a nice cover-up on the booty
it's nothing too cheeky or anything I
actually have this in a 10 because I was
a little bit worried that the 8 might
not fit around my bum properly and I'm
so glad I got the 10 because this fits
perfectly i think the 8 would have been
too small and it was 20 pounds for both
it does come as a little set okay I lied
there is definitely still something
that's off the shoulder it's kind of
problem but actually it doesn't have to
be off the shoulder because it does come
with little sharps as well so I think I
can get away with that off the shoulder
free top kind of the dress top I say a
dress top because if you actually wear
shorts with it it's long enough that it
actually looks like a little bit and
then the waistband is like elasticated
and then it just popped out it's like a
little top again at this one is a small
medium a large kind of situation so I
picked this up in a small it's what we
want to just take a moment to appreciate
this clutch like is this just not like
everything it's silver is glittery what
more could I ask for it does also come
with a long chain as well so you don't
actually just have to hold it like a
clutch you can wear it as a bag as well
it's a decent-size clutch as well it's
see you later oh my god is one of these
about back there little things freak now
you can let use everything you need in
here your phone makeup touch-ups
anything so there was 18 pounds if I
like this would make the perfect prom
bag as well see if you have put your
prom coming up this is a show this next
item is this a little than axel I do
also have in white as well where is it
here it is so I have it in black from Y
it's basically just as high-neck kind of
crop top has this like lease up
detailing all the way down and it just
tied at the bottom a little bar at the
back so you can't really wear bra with
this all I liked about it is you don't
have to have big boobs to wear this I
don't have big boobs just putting it out
there but it's still super flattering on
me I really like the style I like the 34
boat in an a and they are 15 pounds each
so absolute luxe then the very other
thing I have to show you is on a hanger
I don't know why it's on a hanger it's
this mustard-colored bodycon dress and
basically has these straps so then I
have sleeves and then this pot here
actually comes up my hair sucks
it comes up across your chest and this
bit goes around your neck like a choker
I don't know whether this is the color
or the style of the dress but it really
shows off your figure it is ripped as
well at the textured rib so to me it's a
body con dress but because of the
texture I think it's more like a daytime
bodycon dress I mean that's how I wear
it personally anyway I really like the
little choker chest kind of detail as
well have not seen that on many dresses
either it's a really really nice length
as well everything's covered all good
size a again and this was 18 pounds
right guys that is literally everything
I have to share with you there was quite
a lot of stuff in this haul but I hope
