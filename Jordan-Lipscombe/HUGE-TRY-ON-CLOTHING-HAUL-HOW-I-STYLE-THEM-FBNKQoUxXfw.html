doing really really well actually pretty
excited about today's video not gonna
lie it is a clothing haul and if you
know me at clothes are literally like my
favorite thing ever obsession stuff it
just hits me all sales if there wasn't
one dream I had it would be up to come
out with my own clothing line or collab
with a code and write in some way like
that is the dream see I like you said
this is going to be a clothing haul of
course a try on one as per you shot why
how about you decided to do is when I
try the pieces of clothing on I'm
actually going to assign it up
completely so I had to throw outfit that
way you guys can see how I like to style
it so you kind of get like a lookbook
and a hole-in-one really quickly as well
if you do you want to see it more
outfits than that from me and make sure
you follow me on my Instagram be on the
screen right now I'm just posting way
more outfit pictures on there so check
that out but let's just get into this
hoop so I think I'm going to start with
a common little accessories so I've
stuffed the necklace I'm wearing right
now literally this is around my neck
seems like obvious it is just a little
necklace that says baby go and it's from
misguided I actually originally wanted
one with my name on but I don't realize
we didn't get that for myself I thought
I can get away wearing this because my
parents sometimes call me this because
I'm actually the youngest one in the
farm so if it I also have a pair of
sunnies here so these are actually from
ki Australia I think this is the first
time that I've ever bought like more
expensive sunglasses usually I like had
done to Primark and I'm like they are
just all black sunglasses I honestly
think these are so sad I don't know why
that every time upon sunglasses I just
look 10 times ASEA you know just for
like sunglasses complete an outfit and
these ones from @ki are honestly amazing
put them in a little bag I have two
pairs of shoes to share with you guys as
far as pair how bloody amazing are these
these are from public desire I just
think these are so cool
I'm pretty sure these coming like a
couple of other colors I really want the
exact funds now I have the white and
with one you all that is just screaming
my name they are basically just these
lace-up sandals so they have a really
cool soul to them you have to wood here
which I love
then they have these parts here which
they just wrap up around your ankle I
honestly or love themes I select that
perfect pair of shoes or you wanna wear
slaps but you won't like the dress
they're kind of flats these are them the
last pair shoes I have to show you are
these beauties black sock boots from I
saw XS now I've owned a pair of socks
boots before and guys they honestly
killed my feet I was in them for about
10 minutes and I was like I can't I
thought I saw these ones when I saw at
first and I saw that like they didn't
look up high so I thought you know want
to take the plunge Jordan just do it do
I regret it
absolutely not these are so much more
comfortable let me tell you little Pete
so nice Carlton heel bit as well and a
block heel which is of course when will
come for you know just up these are
going to go so well with so many things
so you know I may as well start with the
top that I'm wearing now otherwise I
will forget it this is from Surratt's
and it's one of those like cowl-neck
e-type horse neck situations I'm
actually so obsessed with this it's like
that silver jewel
I just love how extra is it is so pretty
and you can dress it up dress it down I
actually quite like pairing it with
either like a little body conquer or
some jeans to kind of catch up with some
hills so so versatile and it's a really
affordable way to make something look
expensive one thing is though when I
first got this I was like what is this
it comes as like a square bit of
material with the chains you have to
like attach to change yourself kind of
customize it to fit you but I have to
say when you do it like looks are
necessary but for real though it is
really really pretty I'm loving it next
time I have it to it show with you guys
okay we're going literally to the other
end of the scale right now is this
amazing yellow hoodie if you didn't know
yellow is actually one of my favorite
colors this is from misguided and
they're just love it I love the fact a
pop of color to any outside just kind of
spices things up a little bit it's nice
and oversized so it's super comfy which
you know I'm all about and we'll really
dreamy animals like the contrasting
white and black stripes on the sleeves I
think it just absolutely extra something
you know I think this is just going to
look so hot head of a denim skirt maybe
some trainers guys real quick question
when I first got this Irish
we have the intention to crop it myself
but now that I've got it I don't know if
I actually want to crop it or not what
do you guys think think we should crop
it or keep it let me know in the
comments with your physical little hood
as well I bet that would make me look
like a pedo honestly any someone set up
ahead I got some Jordans et enlightened
0.2 seconds speaking of that game skirt
actually I picked up this one from
prelim saying and I just loving weirdly
enough I've actually had a black denim
skirt of my collection for so long just
never really have the feel for it but
now I've been obsessed with them like
they are such a vibe basically just this
dark washed denim and then it has these
red and white lines down either side it
kind of gives it like a little bit of a
sporty fail honestly I know it's just so
cool pockets in the front pockets in the
back since in the front tightly in the
back okay I love how like the bottom of
it is kind of frayed as well and guys I
loved this that much and I got in black
as well it apparently comes with one of
my heads but I'm not freaking cool the
black one is though like I hit this
right up so now saw I was like you
coming home with me I brought the back
they would look so good like a
completely a monochrome outfit to really
make the redneck just like stand out
that way all the focus of the outfit is
on at the skirt if you feeling one thing
to note though I have to pair these with
about because they are a little bit big
around my waist but I think the belts
gonna have to be outfit so I ain't mad
in it really all think has some sick
stuff on there other moments to check
them out there's John's address here you
guys is so fab so it's in this amazing
like baby color to keep it really nice
and neutral so it's super wearable it is
from a brand called caps got the cream
now I had never heard of them and I
found on one Instagram and a little
cheeky peek on their website and guys
this stuff is so sick it's so cute is so
cute I love about this is the style of
it it is super oversized and it kind of
looks like you made effort when like you
read then you just chucked a dress on to
add a little bit more shape you can
always tie something around your waist
and then I sort of dress up by adding
boots and that but this is such a good
piece I think to have in your wardrobe
one thing I will say though is that this
can come up a little bit short did I get
big from that okay good now so all that
I do is just carry a little pair of
shorts underneath and
good to go another right on the final
I'll just simply is not your baby
so I just shared with you guys some nice
and do try like yet it's so wearable and
now I'm whipping out the bright I say
where I've all just because I feel like
neutral colors people like to go towards
more but this is still as wearable like
when you know how to style it any of you
can rob this so this this is from at
misguided and it's actually a a swimsuit
I got it though just to wears like a
bodysuit but the fact that it is a
swimsuit means it's got that really nice
like you know just like that like scuba
material is that what it's called scuba
will go with it to put the nice black
contrasting right on the front and the
back is a nice excuse as well and then
what I really like is the straps are
adjustable so you know you can adjust
these to keep the apples in the VEX
I love it it's just a simple iron but it
helps so much to an outfit I don't have
anything in my wardrobe this color so
it's nice to know of something new and
try new things out that's what fashions
all about just like trying new things
and just going that little extra like oh
yeah these trousers I have been living
in these all first off pinstripe but
it's black and white
such a classic so Tyler these are from
producing and style of these trousers so
they're like loose that's still kind of
thing if that makes sense you know like
still flowering they're nice and
high-waisted which I always go for in my
trousers they have like a drawstring
waist you can really pull everything in
you like suck everything in that just
creates a little bit of shape and then
at the top half are kind of like loose
and comfy on your legs and then the
bottom half is a lot more fitted and it
kind of stops a few inches above your
ankle I just roll up the ends a couple
times because I think it looks a little
bit better but these are so cute these
to me just put an outfit together they
make it look so classy I think I mean we
kind of just hold them up like this kind
of make them look a little bit like
pajamas but ah they kind of feel like
pajamas though to be honest I'm not
going to lie like the material is really
thin so I have them on I'm like
someone's round break series I've been
really into trying to find different
pairs of trousers because I always wear
jeans so I'm like hey I switch it up or
this mm jacket is like so edgy and I'm
like when I wear it no I'm going to
kidding but basically it is cool it is
cool vintage jacket is a fun misguided
has this like really distressed and worn
kind of vibe to wear a lot of array
colors with them I love how much they
did it look quality of this is so nice
is so heavy my arms like see ya again
this is another item that is really nice
and oversized I like to wear it kind of
off my shoulders that's how I always
kind of like to style my jackets where
it does have that like distress vibe it
just makes any outfit looks off every
day if you know what I mean like I said
you just can't go wrong with a bit of
denim I probably have one too many denim
jackets though not going to lie but
everyone's different too like it's okay
I'm going to show you guys something a
little bit more dressier now and it is
in one of my favorite materials ever
this is a white satin a playsuit from
misguided and the whole store vibe of
this is basically night wear out well
basically what that means is it looks
like you're wearing your dressing gown
out which I know that sounds a bit like
you sure it looks hot though promise so
as you guys can see the front of it is
like a really deep v-necks you know
you're showing the girls off a little
bit which i think is really nice you get
the power on the middle three pull you
in and give you some shape and then on
the arms and the legs there's these
really cute little frills which off I
can't no adorable I might have a little
such a nervous coated website to see if
they have any other colors because I
might just have to get them so I think I
need to go to the gym my arms from
holding you out I'll bet that is an
issue think I need like a minute of
recovery right now onto some more funky
little trousers these are them okay now
one of us got these I was like right
they're going to go one of two ways I
was even going to get them this feel
like the model when like happy days or
they were going to be really loud and
garish and I'm going to be like children
what we're sinking hands but luckily
they turned out like the first option I
think they're really cute they are from
pretty low seeing and they are in this
amazing king and prom which I've been
loving at the moment they are high
waisted and as you can see the top
there's this cute little thrill detail
Guinea skinny skinny skinny and then so
like frilly at the end and they stop a
couple of inches above your ankle
these are like that statement piece in
an outfit there's something different I
think they really groovy right herring
white gingham for trousers Karen Karen
Han you did a fair job with these Karen
yes it's not eyelash popping off or how
long
so no this next piece is kind of unreal
I'm not going to lie everything about it
is just so right so right this is a
jumpsuit from Oh Pauline our first of
the material of this is that bandage
material and let me tell you bandage is
one of the most flattering and kind of
best materials I think you can get it
literally hugs to your figure so yeah
like I said from a poly and as you can
see if you don't mind it having the
girls on show this is a piece for you
for color settings make on they'll be a
boobie going on it's still not very
elegant because you're completely
covered up on the bottom and there's
just like a little something going on on
top you filming as you can see a deep
v-neck front in a deep v-neck back it
just healthy straps around the side so
that your sides are exposed as well what
I really like is I actually have a
little toe and it shows off when it'll
tell you which I lie and of course
skinny trousers all the way down this is
so flattering it's just something girly
I love the color like the baby pinky
nude shade obviously you can't wear a
bra with it but don't worry about having
a cheeky little nip slip during the
night because the panel that goes on
your boob is nice and tight and secure
so that's all good I love a good jump
sue and this one for my Pauline
such a good and next thing is this addi
desktop from a source now this is
actually from the men's section and you
guys know I love to buy clothes from the
men's section now normally I buy their
tops in a really big size whereas a
dress or whatever but I just off kept to
a small with bit just so I could wear it
like as a normal t-shirt it is just a
simple a t-shirt I mean first off I love
adidas as a brands I actually own a few
of their things and I just love the two
colors together the pink and the black
I'm picturing this in a moment with a
black leather skirt like shows up with
that look to notice with you contour on
with a simple t-shirt I think every girl
and boy needs
t-shirts like this in their wardrobe for
sure okay these jeans now I did actually
show you these on the Instagram but I
can't help but put them in the hole as
well because if you think if they are
just a light wash pair of high-waisted
skinny jeans however if I just do this
it's like when they are holes in the
knees and it says baby girl when I saw
these I'm pretty little thing I was like
oh yeah up
that gene game when I was scrolling
through the genes like can I really
justify buying another pair of jeans so
there's no like hell yeah do I have
genes that uphold the needs and say
maybe go I mean I do now been again
before these fit like a glove and for
jeans they're super comfortable as well
I just have tomorrow at the bottoms a
little bit sometimes bit too long but
apart from that they're great I have
another little dress to share with you
care no I was wearing this in my last
video so many of you guys will help you
wearing it was actually this little
dress here which is from Oh Polly it's
in this really pretty baby pink color
which is one of my favorite colors I
love the neckline it's that square
neckline which make your boobs look pop
in but can I just say I feel like I'm
part the itty-bitty titty committee ah I
look like boobs in this dress it's just
a really sweet nice little body con mini
dress the materialists waves feels
really really nice and soft it's a super
snug fit in a bodycon dress like
everything is sucked in I'm pretty sure
you guys have seen it these trousers or
flowing about everywhere like an
Instagram and stuff so they are the
hotter side trousers now assume these
although I definitely want the ones with
like the red panel down the side these
ones are from I saw it first and
basically they have papads down either
sides of the legs that go all the way
down and you can sort of unpopped them
so as much as you want basically you can
choose how much leg you want on show
these ones for my shorts are some more
of that wise leg
fit but they still sit everywhere really
nicely like you don't like you're gonna
pin back I just love how you can make
them look like a completely different
pair of trousers if that makes sense so
you can have them done up but as soon as
you undo them I think they look
completely different you kind of get two
outfits in one just keep on corporate
measure solid is that's you exposed the
last time I have here I save to last
because this is honestly like a little
princess dress it is so pretty
this is a maxi length dress from a
pretty little thing as you can see it's
in this amazing baby pink color it's
satin which you know I've been obsessed
with as you can see it kind of crosses
over at the front and sides up like a
halter neck the back is completely a
backless and then it goes all the way
down to the floor but it has this
amazing high split in the leg it is only
from pretty little thing as well so it
really wasn't that expensive at all I
think it looks way more expensive
than what it was let me tell you guys
I'm finding an occasion to wear this too
like it has to be done it has to be done
this is one of those items which
obviously you're not going to wear every
day but I just need it just there in
your wardrobe I love it
good job pretty little thing right so
that is everything but I have to share
with you guys
in this video I really hope you like
there also let me know in the comments
below if you like this kind of style of
Tryon where I pair it with other pieces
to create an entire outfit or if you
like it I can do more of them in the
future

making them for you and if you do maybe
just maybe want to see a little bit more
