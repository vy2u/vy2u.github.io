craving haul for you guys today
supersize did a bit of damage and by
damaged I mean like I did not hold back
today I mean normally what I buy this
much stuff I'm kind of like you're a
Jordan I'm not mad I mean did I pick up
some fat pieces yes I did probably
survive shop that free of my favorite on
like life and places which are pretty
all-seeing and misguided and boohoo this
is of course to try and haul as well
because you know I know it's nice to see
things on and you will be able to see
how we're trying to sell some of these
pieces up what was this I don't know
what going to start with me sky did for
so many clothes scoop the boot over you
can see everything I understand thing
you know why it's actually pretty
similar to what I'm wearing now but just
in that black lace crop top has long
sleeves and then at the back to the zip
that goes all the way down it's nice
because it's it's quite high up on the
neck which I like the makespan is really
really pretty as well of course it is a
lace so you can see through it but all
that I do is I pair like a really pretty
bra on underneath jobs are good in you
could just love a good lace crop top
phones I just thought I'd go just so
much like just art to sit down
they'll size wise typically I'm a size 8
on the top and the bottom but I picked
this up in a size 6 because they didn't
have a so today I would just like f it
put in my basket and it was 25 pounds
we'll have coffee of everything linked
in the description box I'll link you
don't worry about now that says that I
don't know where to put this now this is
so much I love is crop top it's got them
bohemian vibe to it now that first of
always turn my favorite things
white and off-the-shoulder I love
anything like because it shows off a ton
and you know about that I am tired right
now by the way I just got like 20
million light bulbs in front of me and
yet the shoulder for Cascino love it
ever shoulder action the sleeves are
what's so cool so it has these like not
bows they're just like little high up of
not going all the way down the arm and
then BAM there's some sled sleeves and
then there's just a zip that goes all
the way down the back I love this I
think it's sorry with cute
I feel I can go to either crap out of
this especially in the summer not that
you just have to wear only in the summer
because usually whatever now you
a district this up in a size a and it
was only twenty two pounds so some up
this sweatshirt as soon as I saw this on
the website straight in the basket so
first of all it's in this amazing work
great acid wash color which i think is
so cool has a sort of high neck that you
can kind of roll it down if you want
kind of cold shoulder but guys we just
talked about these sleeves how cool are
these sleeves is just like an laced up
all the way down low it's so hard to
show you like this oh my god it
literally looks like a freaking
straitjacket right now I love this it
ties all the way up and you get like the
little string bit so you can no tie it
off and it cropped as well but it's not
to prop just like a nice crop you know
so new crops in one can we just talk
about the quality of there so don't get
me wrong it was a little bit more on the
pricey side but you can tell that it's
pricier because the way of this guys
this is testing so I got this in a size
8 and it was 35 pounds which is so worth
it because the quality is so good like
misguided I'm impressed
I have a hoodie to share with you guys
know I love who needs they are just so
comfy like on camera
I won't stuff like this but off camera
yeah so it's just miss amazing like
blush pink color has like black like
damn thing is it is a longline hoodie so
it goes past your bum that sort of
length but the best part about this guys
is this cry-baby
I love the writing it's in like that
Socrates on which i think is so cool
this is so con cigar that gets so soft
the material so soft like I just love it
I did actually side down with this and
get a six because I knew it was
naturally going to be quite oversized
and long so I sized down just to get the
sort of fit that I want remember the
price of this I want to say 25 pounds
but don't take my word for it be a will
be linked below anyway so I get makeup
on it oh no I wasn't getting ready lippy
on that so these childhood I was wearing
them in a recent Instagram picture I
never had so many people ask me where
something was from before I was like
they're just use a nude pair of skinny
jeans and then obviously as you guys can
see there's like this corset lace up
detail at the front while I like about
them is they're skinny anyway so they're
naturally tight but you can really pull
this and tighten it to really like
- in there is a really nice black power
on the website as well which I mind up I
also forgot to say they are high-waisted
as well so you know even more tucking it
and got these in a size 8 and these
weren't expensive at our wedding this
were like 25 pounds of meat which is
really good for a pair of jeans so can
be solving these up Ramon will be proud
and have a crop top to share with you
guys now when I show you this you're
going to be like what because I mean
that's what even instance right now like
what what's going on this it goes around
a boob it like this I just realized
every single time I show you guys a bit
of clothing I always like to put up
against me imagine it on don't imagine
me in it because start strange this bit
goes around your boobs like this and
then these bits tie up in a knot at the
front and then go round your neck like
this I mean yes yes you don't like start
on my demonstrations on a say see this
is why I do try on so you can see it
that is just so cute though it's it come
in a new color as well but I got in a
black because I just think that's a
staple I got in a size 8 and it was 18
pounds got this cute little body suit as
well plain white and then it says a
wreckless on the front the colors are
justice orange and yellow gradient I
love it I feel like this with a pair of
jeans thrown some vans can take out the
UM arm holes that's on with this scoots
out quite faster you come out at a
really pretty brown it underneath that
can just like Peaks through I always get
size 8 in my body suits that are long
enough to like go around me because I
mean there are lots full bum cheeks not
cute and this was 15 pounds as well this
next thing I've never normally go for
because I never really fell into the
hole like jean skirt trend because
never fall into it with me but this is
cute
the model was wearing this with a little
sleeve lights off and I was like not so
I need it so it should be Jean a line
skirt and then it has this like lace up
there here's also a nice tanks as well
so you know cheeks will stay in I didn't
like what size to get by I stuck to my
size and eight so that it did fit like
around my waist and it was let me look
at the little list it was 25 on which i
think is really good because it is a
nice quality it's like thick but like
movable look at this I love this I wore
this in my quick and easy hair styling
video so it
just like this sweatshirt has a really
really high neckline was worried about
the white with my makeup but it's
honestly not that bad and then has you
know zipper
it's long-sleeved kind of cropped I mean
what's new I love a good sweatshirt
because like in England I swear it's
always cold but like I don't want to be
drowning includes all the time profit
long sleeve sweatshirt it works it works
so last thing from Asgard it is this
adorable baby pink like slightly cropped
long sleeved ripped t-shirt so you know
looks like this but guys there's missing
the fun so freaking barley in the back
is triangle carpet and then this bit
ties around your waist in a bow now
obviously it is Kyle so you can see your
bra if you do wear one person myself I'm
raising on a bottle wearing one because
I mean free the knit filling the
material though it so it's like you
suffering out stretchy tight material
that it would just like go nicely around
your boobs and have them like fit nicely
as opposed to just like me looking like
a say in row boy I just love the color
of this like baby pink is my jet I got
this in an eight and it was a 15 pounds
and I'm going to move on to boohoo I
guess I should start with what I'm
wearing just is like red crochet detail
top I'm just wearing like a red bra
underneath I just love it i never buy
like red clothing i don't know why cuz i
really like it but yeah you know what
i'm going to start just in khaki because
I feel like you guys would want to see
that ass mid blue wash denim jacket
color crops thoughts look on the
shoulders and also for sleeve what's
that about they're black stitching on
the shoulders and then also on each
sleeve as well like this is so different
I like this made this jacket I just what
was so cool and here I thought about
this guys it was 28 pounds 28 pounds
your help today is for a jacket if I
wanted are up this would probably be
about like 60 quid 20 oh you just can't
go wrong can you I got this in a small
because of a salad it's be more fitted
and it literally fits perfectly like
exactly how I wanted it to so I'm
thinking about kind of DIY nests and
maybe distressing it I'm thinking about
it I'm not sure I'm tempted we'll see
okay this shows up it's that
this dial you ever get it or you don't
you'll be like Marmite you either love
it or you hate it called sure this
amazing peach color but it's basically
just really really like oversized a long
as you can see at the bottom nice and
distress I like to start this by the way
is I just roll up the sleeves kind of
leave a few buttons on done at the top
and I just like let it hang black jeans
around by the way I live in my van so I
pair everything with it I start to my
small with this because I knew it was
going to be like oversized anyways and
I've got this for 20 pounds we got a
couple of accessories here so these are
called twist not turban so basically
just like headphones that like to sit
around your head like this or plain
black rounds like everyday wear and then
I also got this tropical one which i
think is really cute I've got a couple
of trips coming up so I bought this more
for like holiday sort of style you know
tropical print I mean I still wear it
now but yeah a full pound each as well I
just feel like they're a really nice way
to keep your hair out your face as well
without having to actually salon tie
your hair up oh my god we've got another
business in the front party in the back
I have attained a bubblegum pink t-shirt
you know pretty simple nothing special
but then you see the back look at that
it says Heartbreak Hotel I don't know I
saw this on the website I think I really
liked the font and like the pink I've
just vision this tucked in or like with
a pair of jeans you know so like it's
different having like everything going
into the back rather than the front only
eight pounds as well I kind of wish I
got this in a medium rather than a small
so it's more oversized but it's still
cute though so then what I want my
shopping I always see these trousers and
I'm like do I get them are they me but
does that matter should I still get them
I ended up getting the only PU trousers
and start what's different about these
ones
is there mat so I can map you use if you
guys can see they don't look wet they're
not overly shiny which I prefer you know
what when a feeling a little bit
something don't stick on a pair of tame
black jeans might treat myself with them
up to you and I thought you know what I
don't have anything like this in my
wardrobe so I just did it I just did it
they're literally just skinny trousers
they're super high-waisted I've stuck to
a size eight with these I got my size
and they were 20 pounds these kinda
tops I've been seeing everywhere at the
moment and I'm not kidding everywhere is
sold out with them so they must be
popular it just looks like a material
again but it's just a black little crop
top so it's just like
bang dosto and then you've got
long-sleeve what I like about it though
is it goes all the way across here like
it's it's quite low and goes all the way
across and it's stretchy so it's going
to like fit really nicely and not like
fall down or anything I'm pretty sure
they had other different colors of this
I just went for black because you know
staple and all that got in an a and I
just took my receipt and it was a really
weird price it was no power sixty like
how random is that I feel like it was
definitely ten pound on the website you
know hot I saved for TP I can't complain
I just realized this is another cropped
loyalty sweatshirt I need to check
myself great crop long-sleeved
sweatshirt kind of has this like high
next thing going on but as you can see
all the way down the front it has that
like stitching as well it's so funky
there's also these like extra string
bits at the bottom so you can tie it in
a little bow and then obviously you can
adjust the little stitching here to make
it as like open as you want I got in an
eight and it was only 12 pounds like how
good is that for a sweatshirt with that
detailing on as well oh boo hoo boo hoo
boo boo with barks and then the last
thing I have it from Boone who is this
little cord I love a cord because it's
just so easy like someone has paired
together two things for you I just have
to throw it onto this kind of it's like
a jumpsuit when it's all together but
just as pair or plain black like
leggings I guess and then the top that
it comes with I can um get my together
just like a little brawl it's got this
like corset lace up detail at the front
and then these string bits here
basically just wrap around your body and
tie up they go really really nicely
together but of course you could wear
them separately as well like no biggie
and also do their leggings but honestly
they are really really thick like
they're not see-through whatsoever that
I cut the bull you know I feel like I'm
going out in my pajamas I picked this up
in an 8 and everything seems to fit
perfectly in the best part about this 16
pounds for both of these fruit roses at
the top
hello now last you guys a bit of PLC
that are pretty little thing now pretty
much everything has to show you some
pretty lifting is going out stuff
because they kill it they kill the game
when it comes to going out stuff in my
opinion like from going out and I need
an outfit
pretty little thing is the place to be a
lot of stuff is amazing really good
quality looks bomb also if you follow me
on snapchat you know I love a good night
out with my girls
Allison Zoe it is first dress is amazing
but off the shoulder dress and it has
this like lace-up detailing all down the
front kind of like that mid file length
is off the shoulder the material is
insane it comes that material like you
flex on us for a drink down you it's
just going to like fall off yes right oh
my god well way to explain material but
it's got that stretch as soon as it's on
your body it's like fits perfectly you
just can't go wrong with an LBD little
back dress
whenever you're in doubt always save the
day all she's got another little black
dress but I hold this up it just doesn't
look real does it that just doesn't it
like I don't fit my body kind of like
that slinky ruse ruched through strewth
if I got sort of material works and I
like bunches up but it's still like
really figure hugging inside the
shoulder has these strings here that you
can even just type in a bow in it set or
you could tie it like around your neck
like a little halter neck then never
with the extra strings at the bottom of
each sleeve that you can tie up as well
like that nice made fine length again
which is that my favorite because well
quite I'm not sure but I've got really
like short stubby neck so it kind of
makes me look a little bit taller
I'm just stubby not there's anything
wrong with that like embrace it I love
this one I got it in an 8 a conch
remember the price with this one because
I don't have to receive no more but
almost inexpensive get off the prep this
one to show you guys you have to do it
up otherwise I'm pretty sure it's going
to look just like I'm holding up my
boyfriend shirt
nope still it's not my boyfriend shirt
basically just this white shirt dress
but I have this corset detailing in the
middle the corset bit does only sharp
around the front like it's not an actual
belt but what's really cool is of course
you can pull this as tight as you want
to really bring you in to kind of give
the show a bit more shape rather than
looking like you're just a rector and
cool it's more that like semi and
touching kind of bring yourself in and
give you a little bit more in a bit more
shape
and now the shirt dresses that one thing
it's a teeny teeny teeny bit FIFA it's
not awful like as you guys can see you
can't like see me through the shirt or
anything but it's all sheer but to write
like a bright brown color underneath it
you're going to see it all the Rd though
just to be safe is probably all tight
coming us from underneath you don't even
know it's like it's honestly no it's
deal I got in and AI kind of probably
even sized it down but then it might
have been a bit short so stuck with an A
and it was 28 pounds I have just
realized that everything in this video
has this like lace-up corset thing going
on oops a little black corset crop top
now I actually got this because I've
been seeing people styling this over the
top of white tops and things like that
rather than just like by itself that's
how I'm going to start it I don't have
anything like this to top I mean not of
a corset details because um I think I
just showed you I think I bought
everything was like lace-up detailing
from every shot possible this is really
nice quality oh it's ribs can also
adjust the front so it fits over your
boobs is such a versatile piece I got
this in an 8 and it was 15 pounds so the
last couple things I have to share our
accessories so the Rings I'm wearing
right now actually from a pretty little
thing these are the only ones that
aren't for take them off yes this is
what they look like a doors have one on
my thumb as well but yeah these actually
come all together so you get a pack of
four rings for nine pounds now they are
actually one size which is kind of
annoying because you don't actually know
if they're kind of set now I have quite
small fingers and there are a little bit
too big for me not like really bad but
they do like twist a bit just keep that
in mind just in case you have even
smaller fingers than me then they might
be a bit too big and then the last thing
is this amazing felt like look at this
double buckle belt this is sorry what
cool back of it is actually like elastic
it it's elasticated to get that stretch
you can wear it like around your hips
around your waist there's that sort of
flexibility and then of course you can
adjust the two buckles how you want
honestly I can see this paired with some
black jeans and a t-shirt this is just
one of those segment belts that are just
completely out
so knowing you're looking at yourself in
the mirror and you're like something's
missing
only 12 pounds as well the quality of it
feels so good so I'm so happy with this
so that is everything that I have to
show you guys if you have stuck around
to this point and you've watched the
entire video you just have a pat on the
back I knew this video was going to be
