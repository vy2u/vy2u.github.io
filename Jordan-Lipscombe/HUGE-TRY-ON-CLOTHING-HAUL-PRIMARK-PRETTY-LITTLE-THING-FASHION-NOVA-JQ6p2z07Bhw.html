really really well and I have in a cyber
week so far so today I have a clothing
or actually a pretty big clothing haul
for you guys I'm going around the staff
and I'm just like I think an addiction
for real there when it comes to my
clothes to see something I want and I'll
put in my basket end up buying it my
bank account then hates me I feel like
it's Aikido because I know that you guys
love clothing videos and I love filming
them as well just my buy things I'm like
hey it's for a video like it's fine
that's a birth excuse but it just works
every time anyway so there's that fails
everything in this video I have a couple
of random bits that have been shown and
like me Instagram and stuff that you
guys have asked questions about so I
thought I would just throw them into you
at this video and then there's a bit of
Primark pretty little saying Russian
over I'm going to go ahead and jump
straight in so the first thing of these
glasses here now I would easily
Instagram and you guys are like children
where are they from so these are
actually from a sauce and whoa they are
dirty probably Shaklee knows this is
just what they look like on oh my god I
look like a teacher they just have those
like big frames I love them so many
people have been wearing these at the
moment they've sort of got that like
geek chic vibe to them now I think these
were about 18 pounds I want to say
everything we linked in description box
below so if you do want direct link
prices just check the description box so
that is where I got these from this card
oh my god I love this so much this again
has appeared on my Instagram and adjust
the red puffer jacket now this is from
new look honestly this is just like a
pillow just a pillow I feel like a red
mature man my where I mean I am living
for it now just so you know this is
actually from the petite section and I
still got a size a it does come up a
little bit shorter it's not like really
crop for anything it's just kind of more
more short which I actually prefer
myself love how like a big and puffy it
is I love the black trim around it
honestly district like an all-black
outfit they only think you can be so
warm it's got like so much coziness to
it holiness it's not even a word anyone
you just think I'm a very white up also
the fact that it just up a couple of
colors any other I love red it's just
like you know those I did get this a
couple weeks ago I can't remember the
price exactly but I think it was around
435 pounds which for a good coat that
keeps me warm because in England that's
what you need you look you smashed it
and now we move on to pry marks because
I mean we all have a bit of pry money
I'm going to start with accessories I
think now I've got three pairs of
sunglasses three because that's the
party how many Oh need it fast buy at
these on 8g pretty key I think they're
called my girls sunglasses I don't know
what is I mean look at these oh pretty
so they have that blue tinted frame with
the cat eye lens and the black matte
frames like honestly I love these I
don't actually know if they suit me but
I mean I mean what the heck honestly
though I want to be key sunglasses for
so long but now I just don't feel like I
need to splurge and get them because
these from Primark
3 pounds you got is 3 pounds absolutely
got my makeup all over it kids just so
you know all of pry marks glasses also
can't with a case - how cool is that
please like the color that the rose gold
so these ones are a little bit fancier
they have this like cat eye frame there
at the top of the lens which is really
cool this is what they look like on
again I don't know if they suit me but I
just love the whole like rose gold
everything is pink right now everything
is pink I love them these ones were
three pounds as well and then the next
pad I got again it's the same color as
this because can't help myself
these ones are a little bit different
though so they don't actually have see
like bridge parts going across the nose
here they have that and a BA to start at
the top and we got an almost fit
gladiator that is not the one Jordan I
thought I picked them up because the
style is a little bit different
honestly I swear I have on T face every
time put sunglasses on they just want to
like chill and I'm like hang o straight
needles are quite big but I love the big
frame because I have a really round face
so it fits nicely these ones were four
pounds you can't have enough so
is I selected sunglasses compromise is
so handy because they're affordable but
they are good quality and I like
chocolate pair of my car repair my bag
shock them everywhere it just kind of
growing back picked up some of their
exfoliating gloves you get two pairs in
here for a pound if you wear fake tan
let me tell you life savers so I also
picked up this little guy now if you
know me I love a good backpack no joke
my mom was calling me Dora the Explorer
in a day because what about my son like
so I love this because it's a dark maybe
color so it goes everything it's like
painting so it's wise people listen up
the fact that it's sturdy like it will
keep its shape no matter whether there's
stuff in it or not it's just a really
nice quality but the best part about
this bag you guys need s Park let me
show you and on my torch on my phone can
you guys see it's actually holographic
how freaking cool is that only nine
pounds of our honestly that's just can't
go wrong so I picked up this gun's
emerges t-shirt from Primark as well I
love like the colors and stuff and also
I love the fact that it's all distressed
at the top so there's like holes and
rips which is really cool I've been
really into like the whole grungy vibes
like ripped clothing things like that
and this t-shirt also looks like it's
inside out which I think that adds to
the whole like distressed vibe it's just
a really casual t-shirt can't go wrong
with a good casualty and it was what I
picked up in a size six and it was eight
pounds I got another bounty
I mean clearly I've been I've been
liking that so is this a bonnet Jovie
one I think what drew me in about this
was the really like dark charcoal gray
t-shirt with the bright one jersey in
the middle think it looks awesome the
t-shirts got this like dark acid wash to
it and then it's distressed around the
collar as well like the I don't that you
can have enough casual t-shirts like to
throw them on it easy styling I'm all
about you stylin I pick this up in a
size six again and this was eight pound
two what picks up another t-shirt I mean
what snow so this one I'm going to do a
little bit of DIY too just to make it a
little bit more me and how I want it to
look so it is this t-shirt gray t-shirt
that says Brooklyn I love the font of
the Brooklyn now this is a long t-shirt
actually goes past your bum now that's
not really nice what I'm actually going
to do is just cut it
to make a crop so hopefully if I shout
hi thank you for being here just so you
know I cut all of my clothes I think it
inside a chest to be another more
oversized
and this was six pounds see up this next
thing you select sports luxe on just
another three is this red crop Purdy no
it's not super crop by the way it's
actually quite a long crop so yeah like
I said it's a hoodie and then on the
arms that has these white panels which
says Tokyo 1980 I just hope I like
sports it looks sporty sport so let's be
real here if we can all wear clothing
items that make us look like we are
fully and workout we're gonna do it I
just love how the red contrast is like
the white and black on the arms you know
getting all something here the red
hoodie with some panel scoundrels calm
down but no I goes in a size 6 and it
was 8 pounds quickly from Primark I also
picked up a pair of my staple
high-waisted black jeans now I live in
these are super high waisted like up to
your belly button high-waisted which I
love now so comfy fit like a glove and
they don't go like grey when you wash
them don't you hate that when you get a
pair of black teens in the naked gray
and you're like like they're only eight
pounds I get - oh eight by the way they
are fab so if you want an affordable
power or black high-waisted skinny jeans
try out the Primark buttons I recommend
or almost gotten last thing I got from
Primark are these beauties like she need
a second you know they are just so
pretty there a new development color I
love the air velvet because then
they add texture to any outfit love the
fact they're nude as well because I
don't actually own any nude heels
talking new Sheffield's but not like
nude
platform 20 years why not about them as
well as that they have a platform and a
chunky heel because that means there's
going to be constant to walk in because
trust me I have worn my fair share of
Hills to know which ones I'm going to be
like Oh get off my d whereas these
because they're chunky and they were
easy to walk in I know that they're
going to be comfortable
these were 16 pounds honestly these are
like a Primark heel these are like
something from Topshop I love
be what now for one of my favorite
online shop ever pretty little thing I
love that place is so bomb so classy but
a little bit sexy at the same time you
know it's justice black jumpsuit long
sleeves and then the top half it's like
mesh panels and then it just goes into
skinny black trousers it's honestly set
sorry well it's just like hugs your body
it's super comfortable to wear I love
the fact that it's got the mesh panels
as well to add like a little bit of
detail to it instead of our veils I
again yeah I think this was about 25
pounds which for the quality of this is
amazing I wish they had like most other
colors because I would stock up if
you're wondering what I wore underneath
the top half because honestly it is mesh
so you don't want unique style so this
was the little wallet that I wore
underneath it some pretty little thing
as well so it's just a black triangle
bralette with these little bits around
the boots as well I want to see it's so
basic but it went perfectly underneath
that jumpsuit I saw that little boy
looks like they're such as staples to
have this was only eight pounds and I
put in a size eight as well this bill is
so extra I just love it take a look at
this it's so pretty so it's just a
silver and gold statement so this will
like just up this is the reason I got it
just to jazz up any plane outfit it was
like it just transforms and makes it
look completely different if that makes
sense so I could be wearing like a plain
black playsuit pop this around my waist
I mean it's not a plain black pursue
anymore what's really cool as well as
you can obviously adjust it so you can
have it like round your hips if you want
it or tighten it around your waist which
is what I do I feel like it just has so
much like sass too many outfit it's just
so nice I think this was about 18 pounds
as well which for a statement belt is
that little thing from pretty little
thing that I have to share with you guys
I'm happy for a while now I just keep
forgetting to show you i'm so rubbish
like look at this is yourself like
honestly if these are the cutest thing
you've ever seen
I just love like the furry bit here so I
know the whole like Rihanna Pima sliders
like a huge deal but I just never really
got the chance to get them once it all
without stopping - I can't be justify
spending that much on a pair of shoes
I'm not going to wear that often if that
makes sense
is so these are pretty low thing I have
get them like they're so cute with this
part and I think they're about 21,000
they come in loads of different colors
too so for like a minute slow much you
set up these in the summer like what
imagine these aren't like I'm now going
to be going to session over now this
shop I want to see another feel like
it's got so me like Instagram clothing
items you know like this or two piece
sets the loungewear also what I love
about it is I order from there it comes
from America I think and there was no
costume charges whatsoever I'm going to
order from there over comm now I placed
this on instagrams before but it's just
this jumpsuit so it's like a best style
at the top and then of course it just
goes down into some tight trousers now
this is so nice it is so comfortable and
materials that are stretchy jersey
material slightly cheese also come
wearing a onesie I got this in a small
and I can't know how much it was because
I did get a while ago but everything
will be in the description box below
description Barcia Nova is just like
super affordable anyway so that is that
I love myself a two-piece so that I
could sexy when I got a charger to B's
well like leggings are like high-waisted
in this really pretty mocha color I'd
say like crazy purpley Brown oh my god
this is like really really oh this is
the top it's really simple and then it
does like outfits at the side in this
part wraps around your waist and you can
tighten a little phone this is so comfy
I feel like this could be lounge well or
you could actually wear out what I wore
on a night out the other week with meals
and best mission ever was alive a Sun
comfy I just like it super flattering
because the leggings are like super high
waisted so they soar pull you in I got
both of these in a small and I love this
two-piece I thought the colors really
really different as well this next thing
is a little t-shirt dress I love this
and so it is just a black t-shirt style
dress and then at the front if you can
see here I can it's just got that like
lace up front with the likes and it will
choke a detail at the top here as well
like I said it is t-shirt style it is
really suffering though the best part
about this though you guys there's
pockets like what t-shirt dress do you
know to have pockets that's like the
best thing ever
I've got this in a small way it does
come up quite short now I'm not really
tall racing on my average like 5'4 or 55
and so I actually have to wear shorts
underneath this just so you know a cheek
don't fall apart from that I love it and
by the way dislikes kitchen
from it comes down quite low so Matt
show you something that you can actually
wear with this if you want to wear like
low-cut things but want support for the
boobs here is this now you probably all
look at this thinking it what the hell
does it kind of weigh donate but it is a
bra I promise so basically what this is
made for is if you like to wear low-cut
things but still like to have support
for your boobs and you know you don't
want your bra showing because I bought
the itty bitty titty committee over here
but if you like to wear low-cut things I
just like to have support so this is
basically a really low-cut bra that
still holds you in but it's not our show
because commish ups as well just take a
mine off and there's little pockets in
here so if you wanted Muenster part I
got my size which if you are wondering I
am a sieve but I just say 15 years this
is genius with this bra as the continent
to our lower cut things and still feel
like I have boobs you know it will be
problems this dress is just so classy so
it's it's white dress so it has like
this high neck it's long sleeves the top
is lined mesh and then there's like a
panels on the middle and then it goes
down to mesh in the bottom as well it is
a gold zipper running down the back too
so of course the bottom half is layers
so it's not mesh your fee for I think
but obviously the top half is so it
gives you a chance to Ellis are really
pretty broiler underneath or something a
lot of photos got like the high-neck
long-sleeve so like it's really classy
and it's white so shows of a pan really
well it's really nice the other light
districts way more expensive than what
it is I also decided to pick this up
because one I have nothing in this color
and to confuse this so it's the Spandau
jumpsuit in this amazing clown color so
it just goes down into some like skinny
trousers and it is suede too which one
feels so soft and so I feel like it
looks expensive again I got this inner
small when it fits really nice like so
just a little bit short I mean I don't
think it looks bad I think it looks like
it's meant to be like that I love where
I like bands oh and off-the-shoulder
seems like it's so me and good thing
about this one as well as its elastic a
tip so it just sort of like round you
the last thing I want to share with you
guys I've seen this whole trend floating
about and I thought hey I'm just going
to get it from fashion etiquette it's
really affordable
and just try it myself and I love it
well that's what you are going to love
it or hate it though so is this like
half hoodie so it's like a hospital in
the back and then at the front here it's
like completely cut out your fit better
unlike the trial portion so in black
citizen see black just grows with
everything and I just think it's really
cool that you wear some soft top
underneath and still sort of playing
around with it to make it my kind of
style and I've seen like a few people
wear this like Carli bybel and stuff and
it looks hot on herself at hey I want to
try and rock it myself so I got this in
a small as well I think it has
everything my guys I think I'm going to
stop this video here there's so much
more I can show you but this video is
just way too long as it is if you stuck
around to the end you're the best but I
