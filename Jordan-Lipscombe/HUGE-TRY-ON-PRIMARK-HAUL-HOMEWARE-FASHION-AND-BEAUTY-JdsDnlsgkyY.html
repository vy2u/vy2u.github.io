I have a pretty big private call for you
guys
we're a little bit crazy think I've
problems if you follow me on it such a
twitch I mean if you don't you I
posted me bags I had it girl that was a
lot you guys really want to see the zoo
so of course I'm filming it for you
there is a bit of everything we have
home where you see clothing I did it all
I'm just going to go ahead dive in Lego
I'm going to start with home wear
because I'm seeing this right now are
you just not as obsessed with this as I
am
I actually picked up not one but two of
these they are so cute like they're
Jesse's furry pink cushions and then at
the back is suede they've made really
nice yet they feel really good quality
they were if I can find the label fine
it's seven pounds each which is such a
good prize like I said I've got two
they're going to sit really nice click
on my bed I'm so excited I love her this
baby pink colors for my favorite colors
I have another pink recently so if you
were wondering where my jumper was from
it is actually from urban Elsa's from
the men's section let me tell you
something okay I have a little bit of a
famous for men's clothes like I love
wearing men's clothes I do actually have
some men's clothes in the school as well
I'll show you how I like to sell them
and stuff but I'm always in the men's
section anyways and move it on see how
these are the two things out for you
first moving on to the next I have
another little cushion it's and this one
here it's like rose gold print basically
and redesigning my pen a little bit so
cushions are always a must this is such
a baby cushion like it was only a three
pound I thought it would look amazing up
against like 430 ones you feel me
you feeling me oh my god okay so this
next thing was honestly the bargain of
the century like this with the box it
was about to some of you this might be
hella boring but I get excited about
things like this what can I say is this
white
do they now I always have a white doing
on my bed no matter what I just think it
goes with everything
some of you might be like how the hell
do you have that because you say
and all the Dimond white sheets fake tan
and not the not busy ends you know what
I wish my sheets and the same time comes
out since no Biggie's no dramas this
degree is actually plot their luxury set
and why this was a bargain this was only
twenty pounds I call it for size the
best part about it though is I didn't
even realize this five pounds like it
just went through the till as that and
honestly me more I'm going to show you
like look did you see that I saw it I
saw it I don't think you guys realize
how exciting I'm there to make my bed I
think it's gonna look so cute
I've been holding back so let me show
you guys everything new but now I like
especially look at my bed together
I also picked up these color baskets I
got a bigger one and then a little baby
one the big one was five and the smaller
one it was a three not too short I'm
going to store in them yeah I'm thinking
one for work stuff and one for beauty
but I'm going to make them work so like
don't look you right and ends are kind
of going with them I've got these little
baby plants like coming off so I picked
up this copper wallet which is three
pounds and also this little bit one
which was two or cause they're fake
because Millican of the real plants they
would like die in a day I'm thinking of
placing means around the copper baskets
all these different in them Oh whether I
place them in the basket or outside the
basket they'll have a home somewhere I
just love little things like there's I
think the little details make everything
and the last time thing I have something
that smells good from one about the
smell I haven't actually smelt this yet
but it's my growing passion fruits
something another it's just a diffuser
and it was three pounds basically I'm
not allowed candles in my house so I
have to solve going for something else
and no wonder you want to smell it
why do you know gallium oh look I see
yes from me for three pounds I mean you
can't go wrong right okay I like that
wasn't a lot of time bit I just found
this marble print placemats
so you've got four four four pound which
hello just looks like this basically my
reason behind getting these is because
my mouse on my iMac always get stuck on
my desk I'm like moving anything so I
saw placemats you use them to put things
on have an ass on that
well sure Uncle Bob's your uncle funnies
you are done or just broke it Oh most a
bit of a bit of a noise but just glide
in quick look at that bad guys plan that
you can't really see that but I go in
perfectly on my desk what next
beauty clothes beauty clothes I think
I'm going to do clothes next but I saw
that you guys will want to see that and
of course I will be trying everything on
so you can see how I like to style it
especially as I said there is men's
clothes in here and I select some people
like men's clubs what the hell do I do
with that these are the first things
that I picked up so these are fishnet
socks you get two pairs in each I've got
black and white - Donnie asically I've
been really into the whole wearing
trainers with your sort coming up over
the top I think looks really cool
I've been loving it that much that
people these Calvin Klein socks from
Urban Outfitters the other day like I
don't know why some things have to shout
out with you life is really irrelevant
but I just don't like these fishnet ones
will look really cool like something a
little bit different it turns out a lil
extra something to your outfit for me
okay this jacket soon as I saw it I
needed it is this black denim jacket
it's nice and lightweight so you're not
going to get overly hot Annette but the
sleeves are Flair's alright I could not
resist picking this up I usually go
oversized with my denim jackets for this
one I stuck to my sighing sighs eh I
think it looks better that way and it
was only twelve pounds which is sorry
good for a jacket the bottom of it as
well as kind of afraid to look like
mildly distressed and I know if it was
really different you don't see denim
jackets with sleeves if flex pieces this
little white bandeau top and it has or
black stripes going all the way along it
this is more of a basic piece but we
always need basic pieces in our wardrobe
it does have a stretch to it as well
which is why I sized down I got a so six
instead of an eight and it's only four
pounds I feel like this will look so
cute with black hosted jeans and even
that back then a jacket like that's
enough so I'm kind of obsessed with the
color of this jump I like that pill
shade with vibin we buy them this is
basically just an oversized a book seat
jumper what more could I want I
literally live in these things it is
slightly cropped as well which I'm not
sold on it is so soft as well I wish I
could just like put this through the
screen right now
because Felix is so nice I feel like
this with some black jeans or even some
new leggings I did get some new leggings
from Primark wearing a set would look
really really nice but yeah that is that
so these are the new leggings that I was
talking about basically I've been loving
pairing nudes with nudes so different
shades of nudes in one even more of that
stone news colors I feel like a pinky
nude would look hot
how many noobs can I say in one sentence
these are ready to pound 50 but I would
recommend sizing down because they have
stretched a bit I got an eight by wish
number six because they kind of aren't
as tight as I want but an amazing thing
about them is they are see-through you
know sometimes you can get leggings from
Primark and they end up like your butt
is just out these aren't which is fast
because I'd rather keep my junk in the
trunk
oh my god I got makeup on these already
are you kidding
that is literally destroys my life right
you know what while I'm on this sort of
leg aney thing I'll show you these so
these are basically their little cotton
sized cool shorts and now when I first
saw these about I was like I'm not going
to suit me I could not wear those but
honestly these are game changers for me
I'll tell you like I wear things along
the lines or Rio Versailles jumpers
dresses and sometimes they are a little
bit too short to wear alone so I will
that jean shorts underneath overcame
wedgies left right and center I was
walking around shopping like subtly
trying to pull a wedgie out and work you
whereas if you put these on you can only
see the bottom kind of peeking out they
are so much more comfortable 2 pounds
from Primark absolute steal now we honor
you at the men's clothes which I love
now I particularly love men's t-shirts
because basically I get them in really
really big sizes and I can wear them as
t-shirt dresses because I actually think
the men's t-shirts are so much cooler
than women's and I love to use at
dresses so I just get a men's t-shirt
get it really big I have my own t-shirt
dress this is the first one I'm pretty
sure this is sort of like Justin Bieber
merch but it's not but it is it's a
black t-shirt where's the staff on and
then the back says purpose tool and then
you have all of his dates chillin there
the material of this as well is really
nice and thick it was 9 pounds and I got
it in a large and it fits it
that Klee how I would want it to fit
nice and oversized is super comfortable
so she's covered this dress with my band
and Eva the black fishnet socks all the
cabin clown socks coming out the top
it's an outfit that's that one and then
this next one okay for the print of this
and the colors I absolutely love this is
more that sort of tie-dyed print and it
even says on it one of a kind P so every
single shirt has a different pattern and
then I have to work right in on the
front so print off this t-shirt I loved
I just think it's so cool that the
colors are really unique this was eight
pounds and I actually got this in an
extra-large the t-shirt dress as well if
I want a t-shirt to look like a t-shirt
dress I will either get a large for an
extra large probably could have even got
a large in this but XL it was I was
worried it might be a little bit too
short which is why for the extra-large
but it's not winner I've kind of been a
little bit obsessed with camo print like
all types of Cameron the green the new
the black and white so I saw this new
industry in mail basket like white and
gray camera crane is his future world on
the front I got this in a large and the
best about this is it's actually long
line so it's made to be naturally longer
so if you are right advising being a bit
too short this one definitely wiping it
was only eight pounds as well
got myself a little dress to eight
pounds I can't complain a mom no come
fold in my mom can be so proud of me
the last min speech I have to show you
is pink I've been upset with pink pink
and yellow
especially yellow tip nothing then this
one I actually got just to wear as a
regular t-shirt because I didn't really
want it as a dress I kind of wanted it
so I could tuck into black jeans with a
chunky belt that sort of I've a baby
pink top minutes of Sorrell wanted on
the front one sister muscle fit with
stretch okay well I guess you don't have
any muscles to fit in there this was
only four pounds as well and I got it in
a medium because I didn't want like
stuck to my body us don't it kind of
lose because I do have boobs I thought
it might like my boobs use more material
I just didn't wear its height to me so
the medium works perfectly and yeah you
know what I'm going to show you this
underwear set like ox it's really cute
but if you are offended by underwear
just skip forward a little bit but you
know what uncle will show you guys
because girls we've all got to keep the
apples in the backs you know I'll give
you this which is white lace people
has two extra to the back and then the
underwear look like this white lace like
the front and then they have two straps
going around you how I said that and
then they are like a song I actually
bought the set because I already have
one other like it that's or black and
nude and I'm since with it so I got the
white and lower the Brant was nine and
the underwear was 312 pounds for a
little set I have to do the math so
quickly in my head there that was so
much pressure hair bands we all know
about this one pounds like a billion of
them they've got two pairs of sunglasses
got some shades because I apparently
collect them got this aviator pair but
hopefully you can see they're like
tinted pink of course I don't even know
if you suit me but I think they're
called I love the pink and they were
only a pound and then another pink per
am i okay these on the couches and they
have this sort like Marbella pink frame
really nice these last three eight
pounds bulk I'm sure so this one's a
really sporty by but I saw it and I
don't have any jewelry like this it's an
arm cast so it goes around let's hope
your arm like this and with only two
pounds silver literary nice why not if
you guys know me I'm eating a head I
think you will know I love a good
backpack open that conscious aware and a
handbag and I feel like they're more
convenient for me I realized that I
didn't have a black one and black or
literally goes with everything so I
picked up this adorable it one from
Primark only wanted to small one so you
know when I was shopping and stuff it's
only something little to bring with me
it's like sweet velvety on the front and
then there is more than enough room in
here to carry everything that I need for
these it's on my phone I don't really
know what oh well why are they there
then I think this is really cute and it
was only nine pounds and it feels really
nice as well moving on to a beauty it
bits now so I saw this mirror in Primark
this is a light-up mirror like Primark
have the light-up Beauty mirrors I
wanted this because my one that I see
online makeup looks with it's it's seen
better days you guys thought you know
what I'm going to treat myself to a new
mirror and this one in prime I guess
like matte black and it lights up so I
show you already prep this and put
batteries in it because which on and
then
touch a little button on the fun and it
lights out like this a bright light as
well you can see everything on my face
which absolutely not right now really
nice sized really clear it's very
plastics in my makeup tutorials and yeah
twelve pounds and it's battery-operated
which I kind of prefer so it's easier to
like transport talking about
transporting so when I travel I thought
these would be perfect because I find
that my makeup tends to get like smashed
or ruined I don't know why it just
always does maybe I'm just really
vicious with my stuff but picked up
these maps black and clear or vanity
cases for 14 pounds you get three cases
and they're like stucked in each other
both honest there's another one open
this one I learned an even smaller one
oh my god why do I have such a thing for
miniature things for it being a vanity
case and I feel like these are the
perfect sizes I love how it comes with
three so you didn't need to take that
much then you could ox one of the
smaller ones or if you like me and take
your whole life with you you got a
bigger one
cover it around them like makeup the
beauty tips I have a bunch of these
laughs thank you
of course you the phone in Primark and
these are by brown articles holla and
glow they do have polishes as well loads
of different nail polishes which are
like insane than a holographic and
really metallic they're really cool I
just have the mask to show you it hard
right now but basically every mask does
something different I don't have a
different design in it so you can see
this is like galaxy print and this is a
balancing mask cheetah print
soothing this one of my faves here beep
moisture and it has donuts all over it
and this one is illuminating and I have
freaking unicorn on him as you can see
though there is literally loads and then
I even have one for your feet they also
have hand ones super affordable as well
they're like three part each for Ashima
which is bloody amazing what our
environment a sizable collection going
on really quickly going to show you
these because I have been using these
and I feel like they deserve to be in
this haul because they are that good
they're that good PS bronze highlight
and glow palette for four pounds you get
four shades these are so pigmented like
if you want to glow you're going to go
with this
can you see this knock out is it just me
or just kind of giving you vibes of the
anastasia beverly hills glow kits and
now you know the highlights are pop and
lasting here why not go actually doing
their versions of the silly sponges
which to be honest with you I've never
properly tried the in fat I feel like if
you want to give them a go or you're
looking for a more like affordable
version pick these up because you get
two for two pounds they feel so strange
to me like they literally look like this
silicone bit in your bra I took out
whole island person you said all taken
my face off I don't know how I would
personally feel about puttin my
foundation on with this but I just want
to let you know that Primark see them
right so I'm pretty sure like everything
I have to show you guys in this Primark
rule that will supply a lot of stuff so

problem but if you guys enjoy this video
