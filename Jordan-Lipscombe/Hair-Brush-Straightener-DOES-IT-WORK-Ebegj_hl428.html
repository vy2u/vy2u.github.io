going to be trying out the hair
straightener brush that was in my last
known on my last video the one before
that which is my dress link hole get it
together Jordan so many of you were like
Jordan can you please it give this brush
a go because we all want to know if it
actually works because it was only seven
dollars so that's exactly what I'm doing
today
just a quick kind of overview of the
brush itself on the side you get a power
button of course and then you get a plus
in a minus so you can increase and
decrease the heat to what you would like
and it does go up to 230 degrees Celsius
the brush itself also comes in at
different colors as well I think maybe a
pink and a black I think they were the
only ones I saw and then of course you
can change the plug adapter as well so
with no matter where you are in the
world you should be able to find a plug
that fits into your own plug socket so
just to show you guys how it works
basically um here you have like a little
screen so when I turn it on hopefully
you guys can see that is 180 I'm going
to put it all the way up to 230 there we
go and then all it does is it just
starts counting up until it reaches 230
while that's heating up I'm just going
to take my hair down and start preparing
it because right now I feel like I have
a feel my hair Oh so today I have worn
my hair curly so it's gonna be pretty
obvious to see whether this was
straighten my hair or not just gonna
brush through I think I'm gonna start
with this side okay so it's finally
heated up to 230 one thing I will say
though is it takes a pretty long time to
heat up because it kind of goes up by
like one every time so it's what 160 161
162 it like it takes a while to heat up
but I mean like it's hotter so that's
the main thing I really know how to go
about doing this I feel like I might
come underneath the hair and then pull
it down because I feel like I can get
the tension if I go from underneath
first
I don't know okay so let's see
so that was once I'm just going to go
over it once more really quickly that
has actually straightened my hair okay
so I straighten one side of my hair as
you can see and it has actually
straightened it I kind of went over each
section twice roughly um and it has
straightens my hair what the hell I was
not expecting it to actually straighten
my hair as much as it has I mean if I
compare this side to this side
the last okay so I've just finished
straightening my hair I'm going to go
ahead and kind of show you the back just
so you can see what everything looks
like okay so you can clearly see a
difference to how it was before too now
it is way more straight now don't get me
wrong it's not dead straight and really
sleek but I quite like it because it's
kind of kept the volume in my hair like
I don't feel like it's completely just
like stuck down to my face and I don't
feel like a bowling pin so I'll be
honest though I'm not sure that this is
going to work on someone with kind of
like tighter curls I mean almost all
wavy hair I to go over each section
twice and you can see it's not dead dead
straight so I think if you have sort of
naturally kind of like wavy hair sort of
similar to what I had in the beginning
or slightly you know straighter than
that this this will work for you but for
all my girls out there with like the
tight ringlet curls I just
probably wouldn't even bother I'd just
stick to your normal hair straightener
now don't get me wrong I'm not going to
be replacing my regular hair
straightener or anything with this I
still kind of do prefer my regular hair
straightener I think it probably does a
little bit of a better job at
straightening my hair
however this whole video was on saying
whether this brush the seven dollar
brush actually does straighten your hair
and I mean I think it's fair to say that
it's on a pretty good job I feel like I
actually got like seven dollars worth of
straightness out of this do you know I
mean right so now I do think that it
works I kind of think it's a little bit
gimmicky but I mean at the same time it
did straighten my hair so I really can't
complain so I mean if you guys are
looking to try something a little bit
different for seven dollars you really
can't go wrong I'm actually pretty
impressed with how well it's done
considering the price so so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and found it
