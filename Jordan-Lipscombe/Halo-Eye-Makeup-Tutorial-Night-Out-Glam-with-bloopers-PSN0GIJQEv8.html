hey guys so today I film this makeup
look that I'm wearing right now it's
just something a little bit different
for my channel it's a halo eye and a
nude lip I know that my more kind of
natural makeup looks are popular on my
channel and I will be filming an
everyday makeup look shortly it's the
one that I was wearing in my my skincare
routine almost forgot I will be filming
that shortly but for now like I said I
wanted to do something a little bit
different that I haven't yet done so I
hope that you guys enjoy if you do want
to see how I created this makeup look
just keep watching
so to prime my skin i'm using the
maybelline baby skin and i'm just going
to press that into anywhere where my
pores are more visible then for
foundation i'm using Estee Lauder Double
Wear and I'm just mixing in a little bit
of the bodyshop lightening drops just
cuz it's a little bit too dark for me at
the moment
and then I'm just going to put that all
over my skin and bounce it in using my
Real Techniques sponge
now on to the eyes I'm just going to
prime them using my Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot as per usual then I'm just going to
set that in place with a little bit of
translucent powder now for the ISO I'm
going to take a little bit of my Mac
give me some bronzer any kind of like
warm burn orange shade will work I'm
just going to start buffing this into
the crease I'm using my sigma e30
8 blending brush this brush is
incredible guys you need it I'm just
working that on the outer corner and
into the inner corner doesn't really
matter if I'm being quite messy on the
outer corner because we will clean it up
at a later stage but I'm just focusing
this really into the crease writing in a
corner all the way to the outer
going into my makeup revolution naked
chocolate palette I'm just taking one of
the darker brown shades in there and
starting putting that into the crease as
well just to deepen it and get it ready
for the kind of halo part of the eye
then I'm going to go in and take this
really kind of dark burgundy brown shade
and as you can see I'm just sort of
putting it in the inner corner and the
outer corner to start creating that halo
eye effect then I'm going to take a
blending brush and just start buffing
that out to make it really soft no harsh
lines and then also bringing it round in
the middle again to start creating that
halo effect and then all you really want
to do is just keep blending and blending
and blending and that's pretty much the
key to this look then going in with more
of a red color this is actually a blush
but any kind of red powder will do just
to bring back the warmth because I felt
like I lost it a little bit and then of
course I'm just going to repeat the
exact same steps on the other eye
now I'm just taking a cotton bud and
cleaning up those outer edges so you
make the middle of the eye pop I'm just
going in with this makeup revolution I
think this is called romantic smoked
pallet and I'm just taking this silvery
greeny shade and popping that in the
middle of the eye and then just blending
out the edges with my finger just to
soften it all
then at for the middle of the I just
make it pop a little bit more I'm going
in with the seek sauces highlighting
palette and just putting that over the
top then if the lashes and going in with
these ones from classy lashes these ones
are in this style a holic I do also have
them in Claudia as well but I'm going to
be using lash holic today can I just say
you guys these are probably by far one
of my favorite lashes I've ever had they
are 100% mink and from mink eyelashes
they're really really affordable in my
opinion and because I love them that
much I do have a discount code with them
it's Jordan 20 I think and that gives
you 20% off I'll leave everything you
need to know in the description box
below so the code and the link to their
website as well just in case you guys
are interested but honestly they're
amazing I'm just going in with a teeny
bit of mascara just more towards the
base of the lashes just to blend my real
lashes in with the false ones lashes
just make a huge difference to your
makeup look is amazing now going in with
concealer I'm using my Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in NC 25 I think this is my
favorite concealer in the entire world
has the best coverage and it lasts
literally all day
and then to set my under eyes in the
center of my face I'm taking the NYX HD
finishing powder this I recently
purchased this and I've never known a
powder to be so finely milled and it
literally makes my skin look so so
smooth and to set the rest of my face
I'm taking my Laura Mercier loose
setting powder in translucent to bring
back the warmth to my skin I'm going to
take my Mac give me some bronzer I know
I always use this but honestly it's my
favorite bronzing powder ever I can't
not use it it's just one of those
products
this bronzer you guys is literally the
size of my head this is the makeup
revolution chocolate heaven bronzer and
I just going to use it to contour my
cheeks a little bit to highlight I'm
taking the anastasia beverly hills glow
kit in some dips as you can see i
absolutely love this
i usually die every single time I open
this I'm taking a mixture of summer and
moonstone and just highlighting my
cheekbones Cupid's bow center of my nose
all the usual places to finish off the
eyes I'm just going to take some of that
same dark burgundy brown shade from that
palette and just put it on the outer and
inner corner of each eye and then for
the center I'm taking that same silver
greeny shape that we used in the center
of our lid
do widen my eyes a little bit I'm taking
the rim or pure white eye pencil this is
kind of gross I'm sorry if you don't
like eyes and then I'm just popping a
little bit of mascara on the bottom
lashes
so you finish the look off I'm going to
line my lips with the Rimmel exaggerate
hit pencil in addiction and then to fill
in my lips I'm going to take my matte
lipstick in velvet teddy I love this
lipstick as you'll be able to see I love
it so much it's just a little stub now
makes me sad and then I am just filling
in my lips with that
after I done it I kind of wanted the lip
to be a little bit lighter so I just
went in with a little bit of my same mac
prolongwear concealer and just dabbed
that in the middle of my lips and
blended it out just to make it a little
bit lighter and more of a nude so that's
it for this video you guys I hope that
you all enjoyed and liked this look if
you did please give it a big thumbs up
and if you could subscribe that would be
amazing thank you all so much for
watching I love you guys and I will see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
