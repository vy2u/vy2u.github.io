how I style and curl my kind of shorter
log length inspired haircut now I've had
a few people asking me how I style and
curl it because obviously short hair can
be a little bit more difficult and I
recently had a bit chopped off and it's
been colored so well highlighted so it's
way way lighter and shower to my sister
because this or her now I know my hair
is not like the shortest hair in the
world I've actually had shorter hair
than this I love short hair I keep going
back to it I kind of want to cut it off
even more we'll see it's literally just
like my blow-dried hair and it's looking
crazy and frizzy so if you want to see
what I do with this then keep watching
okay so hairstyle number one is the
double Dutch braid that's been going
around at the moment I love this
hairstyle once you know how to do it
it's way easier than you think so all
that you do is part your hair right down
the middle and section off one side and
to begin with you just want to take a
section of hair at the front and divide
that into three strands just like a
normal braid but what you want to do
instead of taking the pieces of hair
over the top of each other just like I'm
showing you here you actually want to
take them underneath and that will just
sort of create the more sticky out braid
if you know what I mean as opposed to it
kind of being flat and I just take them
underneath each other about three times
just to start the braid off and now this
is where you want to kind of start
adding hair so what you do is you take
the outer strand of hair and you want to
basically just add some hair to it so I
kind of scoops them up with my thumb and
once that's done you want to take that
strand and take it underneath the middle
and then that will become the middle one
if that makes sense
try and you know just see what I'm doing
because it's difficult for me to explain
but then all you do is just take the
other side of hair and do exactly the
same thing so you know scoop some hair
up take underneath it's all really just
a case of sort of alternating sides and
adding hair and take
underneath if you are struggling to do
this though one thing I will say is try
doing it without a mirror I know that
sounds so weird and but I feel like when
you look in a mirror you're thinking
about it too much in there's bits of
strands everywhere which then gets you
you know confused so try it with that
one I don't use one in this video so it
is possible to do and it makes things 10
times easier so give that a go if you
are struggling and then once I get to
the end of braiding the side all I do is
I type with a hairband
I know this doesn't look too good I
would use a little clear elastic if I
had one but I don't so we're just
working with what we've got and then I
just go ahead and I repeat the exact
same thing on the other side
and then once all the braiding is done I
just go in and kind of pull out the
braids a little bit make everything
loose and messy that's just personally
how I like my hair to be you're seeing
all of these styles that my hair is
messy and undone and then once I've done
that I'm just going to take some
hairspray just to hold everything in
place and there you have two Dutch
braids
okay so hairstyle number two is the
beachy waves about a few people asking
me how I do this and it's really really
easy so although do is follow the arch
of my brow back pretty much and and this
sort of takes up half of my hair and I'm
going to be curling my hair today using
a one-inch curling wands I go between
this and straightness straightness do
give me more of a tighter curl so
obviously I'm not going to be using that
today but if you do want to see how I
curl my hair with straighteners let me
know I do have a picture on my Instagram
which was the first picture I posted
with my new hair and if you want an idea
of what that looks like
but anyway so I'm going to go ahead and
take a little bit of hair like this and
wrap it around the curling wand making
sure that it's flat and I hold it for
about four to six seconds not long at
all and if you can see I've actually
left the little bit of hair at the end
out just so that straight and then I
kind of tug on the hair for a couple
seconds while it's cooling and this
basically creates a loose wave you know
by taking on it and leaving some hair a
little equates more of a wave as opposed
to a round curl which is what we want
and and as you can see with this one I'm
actually going to be taking it towards
my face I just alternating curls you
know some are going to go away from my
face and they're going to go towards
just just stop the cowl sticking
together and it just is how I prefer my
hair to look I'm not an expert don't
really know I'm doing to be completely
honest with you but I'm just showing you
guys what I would do if I want loose
beachy waves and so yeah I just continue
this all the way around my head
and then once I've cold all my hair and
I've let it cool down for a couple of
seconds I'm just going to go through
shake through my hair run my fingers
through it and then spray a little bit
of hairspray in and you this is it this
is literally it you guys that is how I
create beachy waves in my hair
now the third hairstyle is the half-up
ponytail and I'm just starting with the
waves I've just created and they take
literally like ten minutes so it's not
long at all
and I just offer low the arch of my
eyebrow back to find the you know the
chunk of hair that I want to tie up and
once I've got everything in place I'm
just going to tie that off now what I do
is I actually grab the kind of top layer
of hair at the ponytail on either side
and I kind of pull upwards and forwards
and what this does is it just instantly
creates like a poof at the front of your
head so it's kind of there's more volume
instantly rather than having to keep
tugging at things and then I just of
teased underneath of my ponytail just
add more volume and that is pretty much
it oh I do smooth down kind of like my
baby hairs because my baby has are crazy
so I just smooth them down and add some
hairspray in and then that's it
so the next hairstyle is the half-up fun
and you literally start it exactly the
same way that you do the ponytail so
just section off a little bit at the top
but what you want to do is you want to
start wrapping the hair round into kind
of like a little top knot style bun I
guess and then once you've got that done
you just want to you know tie it off
with a hair band and this is now down to
you you know all I do is I just keep
kind of pulling bits of hair out tagging
bits in shaping in the bun exactly how I
want it to be and then that's it it's
done you know it does take a little bit
just to sort of you know shape it how
you want it but once you've done it it
looks good so
and now this is one of my absolute
favorites this is the messy bun and what
I do is I just know gather my hair as if
I was put it in a ponytail and it's just
a classic vine literally all you do is
tie your hair by run a few times but on
the last one you just want to pull your
hair half way through and then what you
want to do is just start kind of like
expanding the barn on each side and
pulling out the front of your hair you
kind of have to keep going back and
forth between coming out the front of
your hair and pulling out the back
because once you pull out the front you
know the bun gets tighter so just keep
going back and forth and I just start
you know pulling a little bits of hair
out I pull bits of hair out at the sides
to frame my face and I just make it as
messy as I want it to be pretty much
this is one of my favorite hairstyles
because if you have like two or three
day old hair or like two or three day
old curls it is perfect because I feel
like the more texture you have in your
hair the better this bun turns out and
the quicker it is to do so this is like
a go-to hairstyle for me
okay so this hairstyle is the Dutch
braid ponytail this is one of those
hairstyles that like you took two
minutes to do but looks like you took a
lot of time so I just section off a
little bit of a hair like a rectangular
section at the side and I just start
Dutch braiding that's all I do I'm not
going to go too much into this because I
kind of explained how to do it in the
beginning you just let you do the same
thing I mean it's on a smaller bit of
hair and one thing I do though is I
leave out the hair on top of my ear just
so that when I pull my hair back into a
ponytail my ear gets covered and then
once all the hair is braided I'm just
going to go ahead and and starts hugging
at the braid to make it thicker
obviously depending on how thick your
hair is depends on how chunky you can
get the braid and then I just off tease
the end of that just because I don't
have any clear elastic so I'm just
working around that and then all I do is
um pull up the hair into a kind of not a
low ponytail this is just like you know
right in the middle of the back of my
head
and then I just tie it off and kind of
put on it to you know make it tighter
and a little bit higher and this is
where I just go in and shape the front a
little bit just so it's looking not as
crazy and that is it you guys okay so
that is how I style my kind of shorter
length pen also how I curl it if you
