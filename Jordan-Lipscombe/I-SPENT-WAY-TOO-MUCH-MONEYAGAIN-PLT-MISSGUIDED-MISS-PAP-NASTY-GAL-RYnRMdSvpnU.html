yesterday with a brand new clothing hall
so excited I have done a little bit of
damage on some Craven websites and I was
lucky enough to be gifted a few things
so I thought it's about time the poll
has just been like this
she's been growing I thought it was
about time at that I did a clean at all
and what makes doing these 10 poinsettia
is one because I freaking love anything
to do with clothes don't know if I've
told you already but like cloves are my
thing she says I've said it about 20
million times
and you guys love the clothing videos on
my channel which is so exciting so did I
have some really really far but brands
that are being shown so we got the
wrecks the wrecks little thing and a
misguided and we've got some newbies and
then I'm pretty sure I've never shown
the last two before my channel if my
brain can like backtrack that far it is
Miss Pat wolf miss Pat and nasty cow and
of course as per usual it is of course a
try on video I never ever ever ever do
these videos without doing a triumph
because it is so much easier to see
something on like you you know then if
you want to spend your dot on it or you
want to keep it for I don't know
something important in your life like
food so I'm gonna you quit it with the
intro and show you guys some of the felt
pieces I've got recently I hope you guys
love them as much as me of course
everything will be linked in description
box below make sure you check they'll
have my deets so my sizes and everything
that as well yeah I'm gonna let's just
do this starting with Miss Pat I love
miss pop I don't know why I've not shown
anything from them
sooner I just have to start with him
because honestly I am freaking the Heian
to show you these trousers like they are
so fab and I'm so cool I'm like how
freakin cool right so these are can we
print trousers they're like red burgundy
and black anything camera at the moment
like literally give me hope I'm obsessed
like they are such as I just hit my
button they are literally the statement
piece to your outfit like you put these
on put a nice or plain top with it dark
like literally a quick
the eyelid I love it nice thick kind of
like a trouser material they have soft
thick cuffs on each ankle and then a
drawstring waist which I'll let me tell
you I appreciate that so much because
you can pull that ish in and your waist
is like snatched they fit really really
lovely as well oh that's one thing
actually sizing so I'm typically a size
8 on the bottom for charles's and when I
went to buy these trousers they didn't
have a small name which was an 8 to 10
but they had a medium which was a 10 to
12 now for you know what we're gonna
risk it for a chalky bisque we're gonna
do it I got a mini diem and I could not
imagine getting a small these fits
perfectly like the perfect length the
perfect fit around my bum my waist my
legs just everything these fit exactly
how I would want them to fare they're so
comfortable that's okay that chalky
bisque was so one and not expensive at
all 25 pound for a really fab pair of
trousers that I know I'm gonna get so
much wear out like I'm gonna live ill me
is gonna wear the crap out of the him
honestly think every girl and boy needs
these in their wardrobe though there's
such a statement piece for such an easy
piece you know what I mean they're not
like statement and you're like where you
I just realized the last two bits I have
from this path are bottoms I promise I
do have like tops and jumpers and
dresses in this whole is not just bees
I've been seeing these around everywhere
like on Instagram and everything they're
them shorts I've been free sort of
layered shorts that actually look like a
skirt on is honestly so cute they're
just like frill Oh white which means I
literally gonna go with everything makes
my life so much easier also as well do
you just want to say I know how hard it
is to just gonna let my aunt go sits
like dying I know how hard it is to find
white bottoms that aren't Seifer like is
it just me or do they just not exist
half the time it's like I do not want to
be showing Muhtar she you know I mean I
don't wanna be showing what underwear
I'm wearing I don't to be showing mature
she don't be showing any of that these
though aren't a see-through so this part
here this top bit I'm not gonna lie it's
a little bit seafood but where it's
high-waisted this part doesn't show like
doesn't sit wear your underwear as if
that makes sense in this part does
I don't see where this is like layered
there was no way no way in hell that
anything's gonna be showing which is fab
and one wants to see my butt today you
know thank you
things like cute and fabbs amazed anyone
else realized there's like and he's like
extender my vocabulary I think it's a
new West Jordan you can totally dress
these up dress them down you do you with
them they were 20 pounds as well put you
over there
the last thing from it miss pop are
these amazing amazing trousers now I
love me I love me I love me love me at
some wide leg trousers I think they just
dress something up like BAM definitely
which is great I know that you can get
some wide leg trousers which just look
like your likes it like two tree trunks
but listen no shape of these ones
fit these are them so as you can see
they have like a chain waist belt detail
situation going on that's hot which is
so cool and then it goes down of course
it goes down to alternates trousers and
then at the bottom you can't really see
it's kind of hard to show you but there
is like a little splits just coming up
the legs you know a little bit of leg
action going on these fit beautifully
like you know when you find a good pair
of wide leg trousers that fit you around
the waist go around the bomb nice on the
leg you know it's a good day you know
it's a good day stuck to my size with
these I got a size 8 and they were let
me just check on here because I can't
remember I'm just so not perhaps
honestly like the story of my life they
weren't bad there I thought 25 pounds I
can already picture these with like a
black top like an all-black outfit with
like the chain being there what am I
like at Dahlia just being the statement
basically so yeah that is miss Pat but
done only picks up a couple bits but I'm
gonna get my ass back on there cuz I
kind of want like a few more bits now I
was actually gonna go ahead and do a
pretty little thing next my absolute
fave like honestly can't stop spending
my money on there if I was our website
if I could put my styling to our website
it would be pretty little thing I
absolutely love them just love them but
I think I'm gonna show you nasty go cuz
I really want to show you this a dress
because you know when you look at a
dress and you sit in you're like oh I
bet that's gonna be like expensive as
hell and you know the ones I mean you
know the ones I mean this dress is that
dress but the price tag that goes with
it
I don't know how they do it I feel like
all I have to do is this and I'm like
anything satin silk
oh just love it here is the dress I mean
first of all we can all the creases they
just need to like draw power I have just
got out the packaging so you have this
v-neck front so you know a little bit of
cleavage on show you look with the girls
I want to show or if you're like me just
it's not anything there to show off but
you can't wear a bra with this because
the back actually like crosses over you
can't see right now but yeah well I
don't even think that's a problem
because honestly honestly I feel like
whether you've got big boobs small boobs
in between boobs in between boobs
you can still rock low-cut things I
think it looks so good honestly just my
opinion it just goes all the way down is
any a maxi dress with a it's kind of a
little bit of a split at the bottom and
it comes with this little setting that
choker as well that's so good if you
look to this dress how much honesty
would you think is like I'll just give
you a minute to like guess 30 pounds 30
pounds for a satin maxi dress with a
choker like what what my mind is like it
honestly fits beautifully as well it
kind of like hugs you in a little out
the waist and obviously goes down like a
maxi dress it basically just has shape
to it which is really really lovely
bonus points as well because you can
adjust these straps as well to make them
tighter you know like a bra which is
great because obviously we all are
different like lengths and links it is a
beautiful if you need that dress that
special occasion or you're just extra F
whichever it may be you need this in
your life for 30 pounds you can't go
wrong you just calm little Bennett denim
no I love me some denim denim skirt as
well just a nice a light wash denim
hopefully you guys can see this but it's
kind of stretchy which means it gives a
little bit of give with the sizing and
it's way more comfortable and I select
my size of size 8 by the way really
really cool has some nice distressed
details in it which I'm all about and
why I laughed about it is it has like a
chunk missing on one leg now some you
might be looking at this and thinking if
I promise it looks cool on like really
cool something a little bit different I
love something that has something
different like it's a simple denim skirt
but it has a little bit of a twist to it
fits me really really well I like to
wear my M
it's high-waisted and sometimes that can
be a problem can be a problem because I
like to have it tight around my waist
but obviously be comfortable around my
bum and everything but sometimes that's
just like not possible however this is
tight around my waist and nice around my
bum we do our chicken dinner
priced at 20-pound which is great so so
great I feel like you'd pay like double
our Urban Outfitters for this anyone
else freaking yes go get them I show up
this of escape from them as well so may
as well show you while I'm here it is
this a faux leather skirt but it's more
of like a map file ever if you can see
that it's not like overly shiny and then
a house like this buckle waist and kind
of like pocket these wait let me check
that they like them real or not yet okay
they're not real but anyway it's just
got like a real biker feels to me I
think it's really cool I love how it's
got the like belt that comes with it so
again you can like customize it around
your waist nice little were a line
little skirt which is gonna go with so
much it's black but it's kind of edgy
you know start to my size size 8 again I
can't complain about the fit there is
nothing I would change
priced at 25 pounds which is kind of
like I feel like that's like the average
price for skirts and stuff on their
website which i think is really really
good oh yeah I have another something
that I feel like has been seen
everywhere I mean that's good you can
you can really see that see then I'm not
knitted off-the-shoulder
wiggly edge in dresses and tops and so
basically this isn't that yeah off the
shoulder love anything off the shoulder
like I love a bit of shoulder action me
long sleeved nice sort of mini dress
comes to a nice length I love the fact
is like you knitted I feel like it's
really gonna keep me warm I live in
England I have to think about the warmth
I mean I say that and I've come through
with a bunch of skirts for you I'm
pretty sure they had a few colors but I
went for black because black is just
such a staple like you can't go wrong
with a little LBD a little bit dress you
just calm it does feel really nice
quality as well like a nice thick neck
John I mean like sometimes you get like
a thick net and then sometimes like a
net that's just like then wow my
explanation I got a size 8 it does have
stretch to it those with a lot I could
have even got a size 6 really but yeah
it was 20 pounds I'm actually really
excited to wear this I feel wow
Jesus almost died you could totally wear
this out on a night out
drinks with the girls or I don't know
out clubbin or you could totally wear
this during the day with a nice denim
jacket and some like boots because where
it's knitted it can look kind of cash as
well if you've been like follow me for
Oh little sneak peek if you watch my
other holes you would have seen really
my mind is just not working today
apparently you would have seen at this
place suit before in like another color
oh well very similar anyway no comments
for misguided or pretty thing anyway
Nasty Gal have that place ooh in this
amazing satin silver no I'm not really a
silver girl me gonna be honest but this
was satin and I just was like I can't
pass it huh it is a place you I feel
like something you might be looking at
this right now I'm thinking why have you
got your dressing gown out Jordan I'm
pretty sure that sort of vibe but this
is meant to be like night wear out wear
so it has a nice low car situation here
then it has like little frilly sleeves
and frill sort of on the shorts as well
and then it has the bit around the
middle I love stuff like this some
nights out honestly it's so easy I can
throw on and go got a tie so I'm pretty
sure I got a size 8 yeah I did and it is
22 pounds
I'm just hang on a bit room I love
things you can just like whip out or
whip out you know what I mean you know
what I mean you just like whip them out
put them on get to go know what though I
have to say I am so impressed with Nasty
Gal like this is the first time I have
ever had anything of theirs and I am so
impressed with the quality of their
items to the price if that makes sense
not only that but the way that they fit
as well it's like they've really thought
about the fit I don't know but the items
that I own I'm gonna sleep a super
impress price so I'll leave them below
but definitely check nice to go because
I'm really impressed I think I've said
that like 20 times but I'm really
impressed time for a little bit pretty
little thing I picked up this wooly
little jumper I've never really been
about the jumper life to be completely
honest with you
she says sat here in literally will you
jump up but this one was just calling my
name so it is this black crops
jump I feel like that's why I really
liked it to be honest is because it's
crops than anything crops I'm like yeah
I think it's because I wear a lot of
high waisted stuff so I'm all covered up
still but I just think crop looks better
me has kind of a high-neck and then it
has these white stripes going across as
you can see when I bought this they had
no size eights left there had a 10 tho
and I was like I feel like you could get
away with upping asides you know them
pieces of clothing where like I feel
like you can get away with going that
side up or that slides down whatever
this is definitely that item because
obviously it can be oversized I still
think that would look good I got it no
ten and I don't even think I would have
picked up an eight I'm so happy with the
ten I love the way it fits I don't know
what's going on but I've been kind of
lucky with the sizing they haven't had
my size so I've just been like that's
riskier and it's turned out like exactly
how I would want it to so this little
guy is only 15 pounds as well which is
an absolute still for a staple I feel
like this is a staple
everything's is taping apparently my
wardrobe but keeping with the cash theme
I got this super oversized what is that
cool let's come back yeah the super
oversized hoodie now I didn't actually
get oversized it is like meant to be
oversized so this is a size small but
what I love about this is it's big
enough to be a dress like big enough and
long enough a nude oversized hoodie
dress can't go wrong this was some sock
boots though you don't actually have to
wear it as a dress I mean I do I'm
pretty sure the model was wearing it as
one as my I think show these little
cycle shorts and underneath so you don't
have to it's totally up to you but I
tried on and it's long enough to be so
that's how I'm gonna wear it I love
anything nude as well because again it's
so easy to pair with things not I'm
really gonna pair it with anything cuz
it's a dress but yeah it is 20 pounds I
wasn't picking my nose then I just had
an itch showing you some in cash now I'm
gonna show you something a little bit
more dressier I say a little bit
dressier I definitely is dressier
because it's like a going out dress the
color of this is beautiful that like
ready burgundy shade I think this color
looks amazing on all skin tones as well
I just realized it sat in a problem nice
low-cut again apparently I'm all about
that huh I think when I wear it though
I'm gonna just kind of tape in like
booby tape the middle just so it's not
so low and I don't feel like my boob is
about to like just fall out how's this
really nice sort of choker detail it is
attached it is all like one thing then
in the middle it kind of rushes together
and then there is a nice little you
can't really see but that's like a
little little cut out this is one of
those dresses which it's fitted but not
fitted but it's still patterning it's
just like where the ruching kind of
brings you in but it's not like a body
con but like it's still I'm gonna shut
up I'm just obsessed with this color
like look this burgundy I think it's so
pretty all thing providing legal as per
usual like never disappoints and to be
completely honest with you the model
that was wearing this like her she just
looks amazing in everything and
everything she wears I buy so no I never
do that she's responsible for 99% of my
pretty little things I swear doctor my
size I think it comes up pretty true to
size and it was 30 pounds another dress
but this one is a lot more on this or
cash side so it is there sort of black
t-shirt dress has a really nice high
neck and then it has this really cool
font on the front this is baby girl like
what does this remind me of no it's not
coming to me right now but I just love
how sort of it has this bold orange font
on it when I bought this I have to do a
little bit of like thinking because the
mother was wearing a size 8 but it
looked really long and I hate it when my
t-shirt dresses are too long because it
makes me look shorter than what I am I'm
not that sure I'm like 5 foot 5 but it
just makes me look sure and I don't like
that I want to look like nice and long
so I thought you know what it looks
pretty oversized anyway I'm gonna go
down to sizes so I picked this up in a 4
and I am a never or 4 but this fits
perfectly it's kind of more of a fitted
t-shirt dress it doesn't like clings me
or anything but it is more like on the
fair size it's not super oversized I can
actually picture this with some like
orange boots or something I kind of need
orange boots now why do I do this myself
let's see how you can talk our way of
signing down a couple depending on how
you want it to fit in the length and
everything and it was only a 15 pounds
in me and and we on to the last thing
with brutal things now I know that I've
said that other things I like staples
that you need in your wardrobe but this
is Legere staple this is super super
simple
I can tell I'm gonna wear the absolute
crap out of it so it's just a black
bodysuit but it has you can't really see
on hanger but and has this um square
neckline
I love the square neckline like I think
it looks good on everybody it makes your
boobs look good
it just is such a pre feminine thing I
picked up because to be honest with you
I don't have that simple bodysuit or top
or whatever that goes with everything
but still looks nice you know it's a
stretchy soft kind of material I don't
quite know but it feels good always
always always get a size 8 in my
bodysuit so you know it fits nicely we
don't get that for bum cheek thing going
on because that ain't cute it was only
12 pounds as well
I couldn't resist it's such a classic
the last few things I have to share with
you up from misguided along a bit of
misguided that honestly would have been
more from them but I went to the
checkout to buy my bits and the two
powers of camera trousers that I went to
get was sold out you know it gets so
excited to purchase something in then
it's like something items in your basket
come on he has a sock I was like it's
only ended up getting a couple of things
so the first thing is actually the
jumper that I'm wearing now you can't
really see but so it's just this cropped
I kind of hurt my legs I don't even know
I did that you're gonna see on the try
and bit part is a cropped knitted jumper
and it has like this or row neck it was
so cozy I don't take it off it's such a
versatile piece where it's cropped you
can wear it with like denim skirts like
jeans anything like literally anything I
think would have really cool some ripped
jeans or like some mom jeans or
something it was I got a size 8 no I got
I got it in a small I got it in a small
because it does have a bit of give to it
and it was 18 pounds I'm gonna feel snug
as a bug in a rug now this is the piece
I think it's gonna look so good with
that own pretty little thing stripe
jumper I feel like this is gonna be a
bit like Marmite so some people like you
either gonna love it or you gonna hate
it but I promise it looks better on than
off I love it I love it so just like a
vinyl red skirt it pretty much looks
like a normal denim skirt really but it
I mean it's definitely not denim or in
any way shape or form it is really
comfortable as well to wear by the way I
feel like some me my be like everybody
isn't comfortable it is comfortable I
promise where it's a skirt and not
trousers like it doesn't get
duck or anything kind of wish it was
like the buckle skirt from Nasty Gal so
I can bit more of that edgy style but I
still love it nonetheless and again this
is that staple piece in an outfit and
read I love anything read I don't know I
think it's really different I think it's
gonna go with a ton of different outfits
like I have so many outfits planned in
my head for this guy I'm pretty sure I
start to mean yep got a size 8 and it
was only 22 pounds but yeah that is
everything that is everything that is
all the clothes that I have to share
with you guys I'm now just looking at
them thinking where the hell are they
