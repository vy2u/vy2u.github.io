whether you wanted to see me in a blue
lip or a nude lip in today's video I
guess I play this hello girls ladies and
gents it's jordan buff it again with
another youtube video not gonna lie I
keep catching it's myself and everything
I'm like who's this bitch like blue lips
anyway I saw this another haul oops
well close yeah but yeah today's a whole
swath tried on all this stuff I know
what it's about I know that I love it
and it is all by one brand because
there's like a shit on a staff uh-huh
and that brand is boohoo I mean you guys
know my love for boohoo boohoo misguided
and pretty little thing alike up here
there was some dope stuff in this hole
and what's really cool as well as I'm
not only gonna show you you know women's
clothes I can normally do there's men's
clothes in this video it's a vibe guys
it's vital but yeah if you didn't know I
literally love men's clothes I wear all
the goddamn time I think that's so comfy
and they look so cool as well like men's
clothes
I'm night what why is it so good
basically I want to show you girls and
of course boys is men's clothes so it
works you know I'm saying but I want to
show girls that you can wear men's
clothes and it doesn't have to look like
men's clothes if that makes sense like
we can all wear it you know clothing is
clothing doesn't have time agenda you
know real quick as well boohoo did
really really kindly send me these bits
of course I think you're so so much
boohoo really quick I might like a boy
or anything but I genuinely love this
stuff I'm not lying to you I'm not
selling out I wouldn't let you know if
something is crap trust me
anywho anyhow any hey let's get started
let's do this I mean oh damn you know
I'd start to be honest right you know
what let's start with men's clothes
let's do it do you know what's really
cool about boohoo men stuff they have
discounts all the time I don't think
I've gone on a poopie website and not
seen
30% off 40% off 50% off men's clothes
it's so freakin good not only are you
getting some like cool our stuff you're
getting it for like a really affordable
price so I thought this is something
that actually girls will be a little bit
scared to buy exercising and stuff sir
sir sir what's that accent come from
this is a trucks or trucks
tract sword I was meant to say tracksuit
car ward and that come out my mouth I
was not even English like you're right
Jonin today these are the tracksuit
bottoms here so black joggers have the
little cuff at the bottom a panel down
each leg it's like white with a little
red a little bit in there throwing a
little bit of red actually says man like
all over again that's kind of like their
little logo like their little branding
like man like a little zip pockets
freaking round of applause for that
because we all have a pocket and then
the most important thing about the
joggers is that they have a drawstring
way so for us girls we can you know suck
it all in and then the hoodie is of
course matching so a black and white
vibe going on that could white panel
kind of like going across the front the
arms and of course man going down the
arms and then the hoodie is like a
regular length hoodie of course you know
it's not like cropped or anything like
that
let me tell you these look so pulled
together like this this is cute as far
as sizing and pricing goes uh where's my
food it comes as a little set so the
bottoms and the top will be the same
size I got it in a medium at which I
know some of you probably like well I'm
actually a size 8 so a lot of you
probably like you should go for a small
know like that and let me just say it
fits pretty damn well and it was 40
pounds for this 40 pounds that's a
bargain right it has a buddy that's a
bargain
so yeah that's gone to the Tryon clip
let me show you how I style it how I
wear it that's the same thing let me
just show you the fit and everything
like that so here is the men's track
suit on I am obsessed I'm a freaking
cest we're know from where I think this
is so far and this is the kind of tricky
set that you can literally wear out the
house like I'd go out shopping in this
like I'm here for the comfy nurse like I
don't we're talking about the fit so the
sleeves are quite long I'm not gonna lie
but you could literally roll them or
just like kind of pull them up like I do
i tuck the front of the jumper in a
little bit just to give me a little bit
of shape I mean you could just you know
hang out like there so she's nothing
else Michael Ashley and the joggers fits
so well like on the legs and stuff they
fit so nicely that they're not too baggy
or or they're so far in even on the bum
I'm gonna burn okay obviously the way
is quite big which is why we need these
draw rings these are very long as well
like it's just kind of like just kind of
hat but no just pull them tight give you
a little bit of shape as well and you're
like get to go
you can walk out the door I've paired it
with these lace-up black boots just to
give it that little feminine touch
but of course you could cash it out with
some trainers like you can literally
wear anything I am actually one
surprised at how well this fits into
freaking cute wearing men's hoodies
there is something about a men's hoodie
that's just way more comfortable than
wearing a girl so my love about men's
hoodies even like t-shirts and stuff
depending on the size you get you can
wear it all in different ways so this
hoodie in particular first of all the
color oh this is a lot of blue right now
going on there 50 shades of grey 50
shades of blue I think this with dark
grey looks so good
it's just a baby blue pretty normal
length as well pucks in the front and
then on the front it has the little like
signature logo situation I love this
little like scribble because you can't
actually tell it says man but it does
but it looks like so you know I'm saying
there's the jet like the softest little
fleecy lining ever in this I'm just so
coffee I got my hoodie in a medium I
normally do with guys hoodies just so it
fits a little bit more oversized so it's
kind of more comfy this hoodie by the
way is and actually ever sides eva so
that's why I kind of like did that and
it's only 18 pounds as well like Oh
I'm so excited to wear this I thought it
Elliot's gonna try and steal this and
I'm gonna make know how cute is this
hoodie though like legit this fits so
nicely you wouldn't even think it's
men's this is definitely more of the
sort of like fitted slightly oversized
jumper like it's not too big it doesn't
look you know too crazy the length of it
if I put it down it completely I mean it
covers my bum but like just about so I
couldn't wear it as like a jumper dress
or anything like that but I wanted it to
wear you know you can't have jeans
leggings cycling shorts like I have
which by the way you may or may not see
these later in the video I literally
live in outfits like this you know the
kind where you're like so comfy but like
totally appropriate to like walk outside
and do your thing
this baby blue color though is doing the
most I love it for all those shouts of
booty mins because it's whereas that I
have one more men's thing to show you
and here's another hoodie I mean it
looks pretty much has the exact same
design as the other ones you can see the
like on the front full length that kind
of thing but this one I can wear
differently because it is actually more
like oversized and of course inside it
is all fleecy as well this shouldn't do
that should i dang I have to get the
freakin varnish on it
this I can wear as a hoodie dress like
the - she's covered don't worry about
any like cheeks on show all the junk is
in the trunk and it just it's cute the
last one wasn't like big enough or long
enough to do that but this one is I love
me an oversized hoodie because you can
wear it however the hell you want don't
be scared because it says like men's
clothes clothing is not gendered you not
know me and said like do whatever the
hell you on that so hopefully you guys
can see the difference between at this
jump on the last one you can tell that
this one is you know a lot more kind of
like oversized and as you can see it is
actually long enough to be a dress like
my father's covered I am wearing like
little cycling shorts on underneath just
to you know cover anything up in case
the wind blows and you know vaginas out
I also paired it with my Nike Air Force
Ones been now thinking about it some
black sock boots the sleeves are quite
long like but you literally could just
roll them up a little bit give it a bit
more shape if you wanted
here like this whole like style this is
me in like a clothing yeah which is
exactly why I chose it and why I love
men's clothes if you love this kind of
style men's clothing is like the best
right move it onto some more clothing
bits now first thing I have to show you
actually in clothes I'm wearing it's a
cute little pair of a cycling shorts I
feel like you have a love or hate this
like from Short Strand I freaking love
it yeah they're just some dark gray a
cycling shorts they're ribbed as well
like the material high-waisted too and
they have a really nice stretch to them
as well I stuck to my size with these I
got a size a and they were only eight
pounds which is so good and then while
I'm at it I actually did get these to
pair with the top that I'm wearing now
like I said earlier gray and blue I'm a
little obsessed so yeah my jumper
actually is from boohoo as well you will
see it better on the Tryon so I went
like attempt to long-sleeve kind of like
cropped
woman has the little zip detail here as
well
zip down they actually look like a dad
kind of get like dressed up gym sports
vibe from it now for the sizing you are
probably gonna be a little bit shook and
one without say at the time but they
didn't have a size 8 in which I normally
would have gone for they only had a size
12 I loved it so much I was like you
know what eff it like the waistband bit
this is elasticated so like I'm sure
I'll be fine so guys this is a size 12
yeah
so it's safe to say that this comes up
pretty damn small I don't really know
why that's kind of confusing that
doesn't make my life a little bit hard
boohoo because I don't actually know
what size I'm gonna be a little bit
awkward yes a 12 and it was 16 pounds
okay so here are these shorts and the
top together look I know I'm a little
bit worried of you know the vagina area
just sometimes I get the like you know
the lines that come here it's not sure
you're like a camel toe but like you get
the lines that make you look like you
got a camel toe it's kind of like not
cute but if you pull them down and take
wear them like as high up it's really
not that bad and you can kind of just
like get away with it but these are so
cute they fit so well this little
cropped jumper I am obsessed with I love
it considering mr. 12 it fits so nicely
like exactly how I would more like it's
not big around here or anything and
together I love it I think it's so cute
I paired it with my Air Force Ones
way of this outfits like we've got the
gym at 5:00 but drinks with the girls at
6:00 but now I want to see I think it's
so cute like yeah okay these shoes these
aren't a whole new level guys these are
like gorge
look at these I've been after a pair of
boots like this okay for so long but I
wanted them to be comfy I've seen these
you know what the really thin sallow
heals and I'm like girl listen I'll be
in them for probably aprox
0.3 seconds and want to take them off
I'm just really not about that uncomfy
like he'll boo life it's just not no
it's a no from whereas these ones
actually have a thicker heel so they're
way more comfy to walk in they have like
a slight point on them but they're not
the kind of point that makes your foot
literally look this long I love the
lace-up frontage you know what's even
better because like they thought about
this how much of a pain would it be to
do this up every single time well boo
just pause it genius
these are true to size by the way so I
stuck to my own size which says 5 and
they are 35 pounds cutemon up next is a
little cord this cord is like
sophisticated but cash at the same time
so the bottoms are a little pair of
shorts in this really cute nude with
white stripes pattern training is so
cool pockets as well and then the length
of the shorts is really nice as well
because they like fully cover your bum I
can appreciate that because honestly
nobody wants me seeing this much of my
chic like oh and then the jacket this is
so different for me he is actually a
blazer and I never like never wear
Blazers like they're just not my thing
at all but this is like a cord I can
like I can mess with it exactly the same
pattern of course it actually has a
shoulder pad switch nothing wrong with
shoulder pads actually think that just
kind of outdated but they're so small in
this that you actually don't even notice
like at all and then pocket pocket I
feel cheated the material as well is
like that suit like
this on my ass and all stuff but the
great thing about this is you can buy
the Blazer and the short step release
you can get different sizes I'm pretty
sure I stuck to my sight of both of them
so these shorts are a size a they are
actually a teeny bit big for me like
nothing crazy like they don't you know
fall down anything they just don't fit
as like snug as I would probably like
them to the shorts at 18 and then the
Blazer
I got a size 8 as well and it is a 30 so
30 48 it's not too bad like don't get me
wrong it's not you know the most
affordable thing ever but for the
quality and everything like that it's
Hurley makes sense that is this little
guy like I said I'm not really a blazer
kind of girl but this this is I
converted me first of all I love how
high-waisted the shorts are and look
like my bomb is still completely covered
which is always a plus
let me come a little bit closer so you
guys can see but this is just what I
mean by a little bit of extra room like
it doesn't look fat like at all
you can see it doesn't look bad but it's
just you know a little bit big just to
let you know in case you're thinking
again in it you might want to like size
down and the Blazer fits so well it's
like the perfect length with the
shortest like nice and finish I feel
like all new women I've had it with this
body suit I love this is from a
misguided and then for shoes I went for
white little booties from nasty go this
is the kind of like suit
I do this because I suit that's perfect
for literally anything meeting shopping
dinners nights out like literally
anything this is perfect for and I love
it yeah if you need something that's
like smart cash this is like that item
for you next up is this cute little
bando moment this is giving me total
sports vibes right like in racer
honestly I just loved the colors at the
red blue why and now she says Paris on
it oh my could have just realized for a
blue white the flag the French flag oh
my god it all makes sense now has it
really taken me that long to realize
that
oh but yeah anyway I love the colors and
the material I'm not gonna lie is kind
of thin its thin but luckily it's not
like cifra or anything I got a size 8
and it's only 8 pounds as well so I just
think this will look really cute with
jeans and stuff just you know a little a
little bit of color to kind of like
spice things up I don't normally buy
little bando tops like this because I
actually find them a little bit annoying
to keep out you know
yanking them up but this one
elastic ated so it kind of like grips
onto you a lot more so you're not like
forever do this yeah okay this little
top definitely covers a minimal area
definitely one of those tops for me that
I would wear you know like covered up
like high-waisted jeans jacket just
because it literally just covers your
boobs but I have gone for a little
double denim moment I'm like throwing it
back I feel like some people hate double
denim and some people love it like it's
definitely like Marmite like you ever
hate your love here I think it's kind of
cool I mean tonight's with you I'm not
quite sure how it looks on me but a girl
comes you're okay so yeah I paired it
with this cropped denim jacket which is
from ASOS my jeans say baby girl at the
knees
they have like ripped holes I don't know
how oh you can actually see the Hat
these are from pretty old thing and then
I got on my white nasty go boots just to
kind of like time with the right on the
top I do really like it though like I
love the colors and everything after
eight pounds honestly you can't complain
this jacket is kind of everything if you
love the fluffy kind of teddy bear coat
coats
you're literally gonna love this like I
mean I already love teddy bear coats and
stuff like that I think they're so cozy
and being in the UK the weather is like
so unpredictable
honestly Monday's have bright sunshine
and the next it's like freezing cold and
raining and you're like so coats like
this are literally a must and this one
is so cute because of the color I love
this kind of chocolate brown color I
think it looks so good on every single
skin zone a long line one so it goes
like kind of hush your bum so it just
has that like faux fur short fur feel
kind of reminds me of a sheet obviously
it's not cheap but like you don't know
mean like anyway this is just the most
coziest thing ever
I got aged no no I love mine in a size
small and the price really isn't that
bad considering of of considering the
quality it's 40 pounds which for a
current like this really is not bad at
all
this jacket okay is so freaking keep I'm
not gonna live right now I'm actually
melting I love this jacket like on a
scene or even much to say about it like
I just love it I've had it with this
dress from a pretty little thing it just
says baby go I just like the fact it's
orange I feel like the orange and the
brown actually go really nicely while I
love about this jacket
okay that you can legit wear it with
like dresses and stuff like I have like
it meets it perfectly which means if I
want a right dress but it's like cold
outside you can put like a jacket like
this on you good
honestly I just love teddy bear coats
and anything like this oh and also I
paired it with my black booties from a
Primark as well I keep saying booties
next have a jumpsuit to show you guys
and it's actually a little bit different
to my normal style I never have owned
anything that's clot style
I always just used to think like it made
me look stubbier than air I mean I'm not
sure I'm like 5 foot 5 but I just use
the thing that clots made me look even
smaller huh but this jumpsuit is like a
longer color and it's really flowy and
just like it just looks different I
don't know so it's a little stripe
moment which already is kind of
different for me but I just love the
colors and I just think this is gonna be
like major holiday vibes Navy and white
stripes which i think is so cute the
neck as well it kind of comes like up
here it's kind of this quite high the
cut off the sleeves I'm not gonna lie is
not normally my thing like they kind of
you know I'm like they cut in like this
I don't like the way it kind of makes my
shoulders and stuff look but I like
sacrifice it cuz it's cute and then the
trouser legs are like wide leg and they
kind of come to like midway down or
share not say pockets jumpsuit with
pockets
hello I love the material of this as
well it's like that thin follow II
material which will be like perfect for
summer and stuff picture of me on the
beach with my cocktail or at night with
my cocktail sunset in sipping this on to
be completely honest with you guys I saw
this in the model when I was like okay I
need it I've got mine in a size a and it
was 25 pounds so yeah a pretty sunny
price okay so here's the jumpsuit on and
kind of like styles and everything I
mean of course I love it it's in the
hole but I just wanted to show you it
like on camera how I style and stuff
like I said it fits perfectly everywhere
the waist I prefer to have a bit more
shape so I put this Primark belt with it
and then for shoes I've gone with these
lace up the boots these are the ones you
saw earlier in the hall from boohoo I
don't know what it is okay I don't know
what it is I love like its height sock
boot with Klotz I think it looks so nice
that you can kind of this is where the
jumpsuit cuts off and then you can see
the boot I don't know what it is about
that it's legit the perfect length as
well for holding my vagina for you know
my underneath sec
and so it doesn't feel like it's like
ripping into my bum my vagina
nothing just like point now and let you
know this is a teeny bit see-through I
don't know whether the cameras gonna
pick it up I've got on my red lounge
underwear underneath and you can
actually see like the writing and stuff
here so I would say just wear nude or
white under way just like solve that
shoe but yeah from that I freaking love
this so much okay how cute is this
bodysuit though I am obsessed with these
colors like the mustard with the brown I
mean yellow is my favorite color so I
was like in attracted to this but with
the brown I love the pattern as well you
know that saw like check I think it's
really really interesting the cut of it
is so nice as well it's that like square
neck which i think is so flattering like
on your dÃ©colletage and then the back is
exactly same cut as well but it's nice
because you can still wear a Brar and
everything as well you know and here's
some support for my end ability is
because they need they need a little
help so it's cool that you can do that
and then yeah it's a bodysuit and what I
really like as well is it is a thong so
we're not gonna get any four bum cheeks
going on you're not gonna get any ppl
zero which is really nice it is quite
high cut so I would say you'd have to
wear something high-waisted with it and
then of course you have some buttons so
you can you know you don't have to like
do the pull to the side motion when you
need a we also can I point out look how
stretchy this is blimey sizing in price
I gotta say a and it is 14 pounds I just
wanted to keep the outfit like super
duper planes so that like this pattern
in color everything could kind of stand
out it is a little bit of a harder item
to style because yellows and browns can
go kind of same colors I feel like I've
had it with this distressed denim skirt
from Urban Outfitters this little bum
bag which you'll see later in the hall
as well and then just some black shiny
booties from Primark but yeah that is it
this is this little outfit I have a pair
of jeans these are actually mum style
jeans I just think they look so cool so
cash like something a little bit come
for you as well so these ones from
boohoo they're in like a medium wash
denim which is actually my favorite and
then they have some of like rips so this
leg has a few rips here this one has
like one in the knee and a few which I
really like the whole like distressed by
and then the bomb as you can see it's
kind of like afraid and just like we
don't mind we don't care too much we
just kind of we're down now I don't know
if you guys have tried mum G
but sometimes they can be kind of fun
flowering because some are just so baggy
make you look like you have no bum and
it just makes me look like pancake but
these ones from boohoo actually fit the
only thing I would say about them though
you'll see on the Tron clip is they are
a little bit big round my waist you know
you get that like wig gap on the back
and you're like what the hell love them
okay Susie jeans are on what it should
have like low at the camera the hey can
you guys kind of see what I mean by moss
or like fitted Jean as you can see lot
on the balm they're way more fitted or
like the thighs they are and then it
gets down to the bottom and they're like
a little bit looser if you can see I
feel like jump like probably will have
to put a belt with them because they do
have that likes baggy gap you can see
that so need something to just kind of
like bring everything in a little bit
like can you see how they're just a
little bit bigger on the waist for me
just like a little bit outfit-wise I
just pet it with this amber top that is
from misguided and then my black and
white checkered advance on my feet oh
yeah and I actually like rolled up like
fell on my wardrobe good I rolled up the
jeans once at the bottom just to give it
a little bit more shape so I don't look
so like small but yeah often that that's
it it's literally so simple this outfit
I feel like it's that cash everyday
outfit they're like we all need I have
one more clever writing to share with
you and then I have just a lil accessory
a little bag it is a jumper this time
round I mean I love myself a good
knitwear piece how funky is this this is
like a groovy jumper kind of give me
some credit evil vibes would embrace it
it is a roll neck jumper I mean that is
not the neck oh my gosh and then half
the jumper is white half the jumper is
black but the sleeve on the white side
is black as well it kind of hangs low
it's not like a batwing but it just
hangs like Aloha so it gives it more
like a baggy a feel it's a long line
jumper as well so kind of that covers
your bum and stuff I don't know I just
think this is so groovy and so different
that I kind of love it as jumper comes
in a small medium or medium to large I
say so up and got the medium to large
because I did want it to be really like
flowy and just like loose and just you
know how it is I mean I'm not gonna lie
looks huge on camera like you could fit
like four of me in here and it's 20
pounds as well so
when I was trying this outfit on I
decided that the hair needed to come
down in a little baked we had media to
cut my whole obsessed with this hat this
is one nasty girl by the way but yeah
this is the jumper on I've tucked in the
front and stuff just to kind of show off
the skirt and now as you can see is
definitely like a looser armed like that
Winnie style
jumper if I like untuck it you'll be
able to see how long it is as well like
it literally covers you know I look like
a painter like a French like but yeah
this is what I decided to pair it with I
kept this super super monochrome and
stuff just because I thought that'd be
like me easiest this skirt which oh my
god I'm a princess where this is from a
Topshop and then I went for my I saw at
first sock boots as well just to kind of
like dress the whole thing up I forgot
to mention earlier as well just in case
you do have sensitive skin and you were
curious whether it's itchy or not it's
not itchy at all it's a really
comfortable knit so yeah we want to last
thing now if you've made it this far
into the video like props to you because
I talk for free in England but yeah like
I said it's an accessory and it's this
horrible little bum bag I'm sorry
but this is so Diddy that is so cute
I've been obsessed with bum bags purely
because I love a bag okay but carrying a
bag sometimes it's just such an
inconvenience
I get like shoulder pain and I just
honesty I'm a grandma it's a little bum
bag you can put your essentials in here
wrap it around your waist you don't even
have to might worry about it it's like
the best thing ever
has a little buckle here but it is
literally just a bunt again to there
which is great because then you don't
have to like worry about this for ruler
I imagine having to that buckle up every
single time you open your bag what I
really like most though is like the
quilted bit here I think it makes it
look way more expensive than what it was
and then inside you have like a little
pocket at the front you have a book at
the back you have a zip there was
actually quite a bit of room in here
it was literally only 12 pounds - which
is so freaking good and it's just gonna
come so in handy like this I've like bum
bags need to be like more of a thing
because the best thing ever right that
is this whole done we have finally made
