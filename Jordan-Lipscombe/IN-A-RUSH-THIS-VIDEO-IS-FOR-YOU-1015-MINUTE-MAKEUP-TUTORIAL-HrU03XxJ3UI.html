another video so we've all had them days
right well for some of us actually might
be like every day where we wake up we
wanna put on some makeup me up we wanna
look decent but let's be real we just
don't have the time we want something
that takes like 10 15 minutes we can put
on our face and go so this video is for
all of my boys and girls out there who
you know have 10-15 minutes in the
morning it's just throw on a face I got
you I got you this makeup look in a way
right now just showing you this is
exactly that makeup look so it's really
really skin focused so the majority of
the makeup is just skin then we've
worked on some mascara really really
quick lip product and that is it I feel
like as long as your skin it looks and
ready to go really healthy and then the
rest of the makeup can you just comes
together now I know what you might be
thinking that did not look like it took
10-15 minutes but I mean it's like a
prove it to you right here right now I'm
gonna play a clip of me sped up doing
this makeup in about 10-15 minutes if of
course you skip some steps out or ever
it will be quicker for this is me doing
all the steps in this video as you can
see I like time and everything to prove
to you that it took me 10 or 15 minutes
it's just like that quick glam you throw
on you fill put together you're ready to
go you're ready to face the world so for
all my little makeup lovers out there
who you know are short on time in a rush
just when I think Wieck go go go
hopefully you will love this video so if
you don't know how I did this and then
it just keep watch and ESCO okay this
should do the video oh look my bun just
about fits in okay oh let's begin and
let's put some makeup on their face so
the first step I'm gonna do is primer I
mean keeping it real if you're in like a
mega rush you could totally just skip
this step but I just kind of like the
way it feels to be honest this one is
the FMT Beauty one it just feels really
good makes my skin feel really soft
we're going to go straight into
foundation now being completely honest
with you guys
honesty is the best policy this little
section of the video so the foundation
part with ex1 is really really kindly a
sponsored I was so flippin excited when
they contacted me and asked if I wanted
to use this foundation in a video
because I mean for an OG if you've been
around law I use this in my first ever
youtube video and it's
takes me back for the first time I guess
I can't believe I'm gonna do this
because this is so embarrassing like far
olloclip now of me using it in my first
youtube video to kind of show you that I
use this all the time it was all my
favorite foundations I'm such a baby in
that video it literally just melts my
little Jordyn I'm like all right now but
honestly low-key it's pretty
embarrassing like you're watching them
old videos backs makes me cringe power
your side son Wes was fine I just loved
that when that happens when brands that
you actually love contact you obviously
are only ever work with brands and
products etc that I actually love but
this is a little throwback for me I love
it
so yeah this foundation is the ex1
invisi wear liquid foundation the color
that I'm using by the way is 8.0 I mean
you guys know I love a foundation that
actually will like cover my skin I saw
my skin to be able to breathe and you
know not alike you know we're baking a
cake up in here this foundation is that
perfect everyday wear as well because it
it's more of a medium coverage but you
can totally like a build on it to get
the coverage that you personally like
which is a fab no I don't know whether
you guys can like see right now but I
haven't even blend in this foundation
down my neck and it pretty much like
already matches me what's super
interesting about this foundation is it
has like pigments in it that matches the
like natural human skin tone the best
how crazy is that like this is science
all up in here have you ever had it
where you use a foundation and it's like
super orange or like really pink whereas
this donation is more kind of skin like
color wise which is great because you
know I'm not trying to look like an
oompa loompa so here is one layer on my
skin you can see there is some things
still peeking through but it looks so
natural it looks glowy and healthy it's
just still it's really skin like I can't
even fit on my skin Eva it's so
lightweight which is a fab because you
know I don't want to feel like I'm
wearing a brand new face I want it to
fill up my face you know but a little
more you know no more humps oh my god
okay this is so cool right I'm just
reading up about it I'm about to get a
little bit more sciency on you but it
says that this foundation has a unique
fair of course fear of course fit hmm
okay basically the little pigments in
the foundation I have a coating on them
and it stops your foundation from
oxidizing throughout the day which is
great
I believe there's 13 shades and it's
only 12 on 50 and guys
guys you're gonna be able to get your
house on this foundation like super
super easily because it is being
released in boots can I have can have a
round of applause please
it's so good you know I love that
because and you can actually go install
swatch it and see what matches you oh my
god actually I remember about the
packaging I remember from when like baby
Jordan use this as you use the product
it gets like pushed up like this so you
can see how much you've got left in the
packaging how is that I can see like I'm
gonna use my it's heart-shaped tape I'm
using this concealer because you can
literally whack it on and have like the
best coverage ever a little bit here a
little bit here a little bit a little
bit with my sponge especially one you
want to do your makeup quicker you just
want someone that's gonna like cover
instantly and blend out really quickly
and this is that concealer for me okay
cool I think we are all blended really
quick I'm gonna go ahead and just sort
of baked underneath my eyes and set my
entire face with the Beauty bakery
flower
saying powder you guys know this is like
my favorite powder some of you might be
like how the hell do you have time to
bake when you want to be quick but I
pack this on and leave it while I'm
doing my eyebrows so I'm kind of not
waiting for it I'm doing other things
while it's doing its thing got me on and
then I set my face as well so that
everything else and like powder products
they pull and I'm over on and stuff will
go on so much better that way you know
in the morning when you do your makeup
is just gonna glide on and be like done
for my eyebrows I'm gonna use the
Primark skinny brow pencil in brown I've
spoken about this recently on my channel
it's two pounds it is so good it's just
like the benefit one it's just like the
Anastasia one if you do want to see how
I do my eyebrows I will leave a little
thing in me eye here it is a little bit
more in-depth and obviously cuz I have
already done it I don't want to like all
you in this video it just does my
eyebrows so quickly like the shape it
fills them in everything and it's still
it really natural at the same time just
taking a little bit of brow powder
through at the front just wanna get a
really really quick soft gradient like
that I see how quick that was like BAM
I do like to kind of clean my eyebrows
up obviously if I'm in a bit more of a
rush I kind of just skip that step to be
honest powder
obviously you know they aren't like the
best eyebrows you've ever seen in your
life but for quick ly brows not too bad
and then real quick just to bring out
the hair even more I'm using my Aiko a
brow gel this is like that little step
which makes a huge difference like sets
them in place so they're you know don't
go anywhere
it brings out the hairs as well and
anything she takes two seconds let me
just you know just this off okay so I'm
looking a little bit corpsey right now
it's not my best look I'm gonna use this
today for my bronzer on my Harley I
haven't actually used it before on at my
channel I don't really know why to be
honest I think I've just been so caught
up in my makeup forever buttons are
there I just like don't use anything
else I forget I have about 20 million
bronzers in my drawer this one I like it
this is by Brown called be bold and it's
their contour kit so it's got a concert
contour cut it's got a concert
I mean if contour bronzer and highlight
in it as you can see soon but the
contour bronzer highlight this bronze up
oh it's such a good shade alameen you
should have to dip apply and already
there it is the good thing that I like
about this compared to my makeup forever
one is this is more kind of pigmented so
the color instantly applies so when
you're in a bit of a rush it's sort of
one swipe and you're there you know
what's really bugging me right now this
little guy don't you think spots are so
rude though like they just come like
whenever they want like don't even tell
you they're coming they just show up
just see how we look a little bit more
alive now just adds a little bit more
color and a little bit more life to your
face and that's what I need I'm gonna be
adding some blush just to add a little
bit more of like a natural flush of
color to my skin this one's my makeup
geek is in the color covet is this
really nice like berry color add a
little bit to my cheeks like a little
flush of color or oh that is pigmented
let's just stir still that down I always
forget how pigment said make okie
blushes on and then I put on my face on
that oh yeah oh yeah okay cool I feel so
much better now that I have color to my
skin for highlight I'm gonna go back
into this be bold one and this is the
highlight shade here oh boys and girls
this highlighter this has been slept on
this is dry okay this is dry
instantly BAM that's exactly what I want
so you know we haven't got to sit here
and be like piling on that high layer
you know you want that instant glow mind
you I know everyone probably doesn't
want a glow this crave rich sugar which
is of course like so fun I mean there's
so many highlight is out there these
days
anyway is that you so I can see you from
my bow line in highlighter I'm actually
so disgusting like feel free to
unsubscribe in still girl's vision dad
anyway enough for the highlighter super
super simple now we are just for the
eyes gonna whack on some mascara if I
was gonna recommend one mascara it would
be the Maybelline lash sensational that
is like one of the best scorers however
sadly our eye Pizza my one because right
now so gonna be using this one instead
and I don't know why I haven't used it
sooner because hi the Kiko 42.0 mascara
and the reason why I love this so much
is because I don't know if you guys can
see the wand is like itty bitty is such
a big one and I know what you're
probably thinking we're in a rush why
would I want a small wand I just want to
walk on and go but the reason why I like
this is of course when I want minimal
makeup and I'm just peeing on mascara I
want my lashes to look the best that
they possibly can I want to get like
every single lash so this little brush
here gets right into the outer corner
right into the inner corner just like
really lengthens everything and it's
perfect for the lower lash line I love
how I'm like the mimicking like this
like pretending to put it on Oh actually
wait hold on the tip set your eyelids
with translucent powder just to make
sure just to make sure your mascara
doesn't transfer not that I've
experienced that with this one but you
never know you see how much this musk I
can get right into the root give it a
little wiggle I love this little brush
also just to say I do read the comment
section I've seen a few of you asked if
I can like zoom in a little bit more
unfortunately my new lens that I have
isn't a zoom lens so I can't zoom in
this is literally the closest you guys
can come so what I will do you guys
probably would have seen in the
beginning I'm gonna record close-up
clips of my face you can see everything
close up that way rather than me showing
you as I do it I know it's really
annoying I'm really sorry I know you do
want to see close-up but yeh you're my
eyes and no longer board this mascara
definitely gives you more thats thicker
lash that's for sure
when I don't wear lashes or I CRO on
that mascara
I put some on the bottom god I never put
mascara on my bottom eyelashes normally
I forget how long they are then the very
last thing I like to do is just add a
little bit of color to my lips just to
bring the whole look together these two
here so quick to put on like instant
color and they're really comfortable as
well they're just perfect for everyday
it just depends whether I want to go
more glossy or whether want to go more
matte so if I want to go more glossy I
spoke about these before the Maybelline
live with hot lacquers are such a great
choice look how pigmented they are like
instantly but I want to use something
different so I'm gonna go for this one
so this is a makeup geek product this is
their creme stain it says it's a stain
but honestly it's more kind of like a
liquid lipstick this color is called
quickstep oh that's so cute
you know I think would be really cute as
well if you have that little bit of
extra time let's you like like extra 30
seconds putting on something like faux
freckles would look so cute and actually
will help enhance like the more natural
nurse you know and make it look like
your skin if you do want to do that two
little products I think a perfect for it
the Rimmel brow this way and the
collection define and perfect little
eyebrow products here they're little
ones with eyebrow powder on which is
perfect because the shape of it is
already like a freckle shape and you can
see they just apply little dots on your
skin you can just do that in this off
area here and take your Beauty Blender
and just like bounce over it to soften
it and where it's powder it will do it
like instantly I'll do a few to show you
so I'm gonna use the collection one cuz
it's a little bit thinner just don't on
you might think it looks a little bit
crazy in a little bit like intense right
now but they're worth it will come
together I just take my spanned and just
press over the top so you know it
doesn't look like we have literally just
drawn on freckles gave depth that day I
was gonna dab then don't do that to
yourself Jordan it and yeah it looks a
little bit like this hopefully you can
see it just adds like a little something
all this have to do now is spray a
little bit of setting spray this one is
the Ofra makeup fixer which is when i
absolute favorite setting sprays I
discovered this recently is I changed
the sentence pray game for me
I think that is everything guys so that
is this quick 15 minute makeup look done
