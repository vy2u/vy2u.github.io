Chanel I hope you're all doing really
really well so today's video is one of
many that I'm sure you've seen floating
around YouTube at the moment I didn't
know whether to film this because
everyone's doing it but you guys wanted
to know my opinion so doing it for you
I'm basically testing out the Rihanna
fancy makeup arrange and basically
letting you guys know what I think you
should spend your money on because I'm
gonna be honest I don't think you need
to buy all of it you'll see in the video
but there's some things I wouldn't even
bother but there are some bits in here
which I definitely think is worth try
out yeah like I said I know there's a
lot these videos going around at the
moment we're all like jumping on it we
want to test it but I have tried not to
watch any so I can sit down here and
basically give you guys like my real
impression so I'm not like influenced by
any things yeah that's what I'm coming
at you guys with today that's what your
girls doing so yeah if you do want to
know my opinion on it and why do I think
it is worth are you guys spending your
coins on just keep watching okay so in
this little package here I have all of
the Brianna maker bits that I picked up
okay I'm excited so basically I picked
up over the makeup that I would actually
use otherwise I'm just like what's the
point you're just gonna be chillin in my
drawer you know I do put things in my
basket but then I have to just keep it
really me like are you actually gonna
use them actually gonna use them
honestly I have to talk myself out of
things otherwise like so I have the
primer foundation contour stick
highlight stick duo highlighter and the
lip gloss there are six things I feel
like that's pretty good going right I'm
going to quit with this and actually get
into what you want to see the makeup so
the first thing that I have to try is
the soft matte pro filter instant
retouch primer oh that's a long name it
says on it's smooth pour diffusing
finish and extended makeup aware let's
see
now this is 24 pounds which for a primer
I'm not gonna lie that is pretty
expensive but then to be fair the rest
of our range I've not known eyes she
could have priced it so much higher like
I mean she's rihanna she could have gone
more like kylie jenner prices but she's
kept it pretty reasonable i think no see
on kylie you but i just think for a
primer it's more on the expensive side
but if it's good there
okay let's company girl this packaging
is boogy boogy is it a frosted glass
bottle comes with a palm nude this is
everything the aesthetics of this
package in ten out of ten from me Oh
kind of looks like a tan moisturizer I'm
just gonna apply this with my fingers
because it's just what I do
feels nice it just feels like a
moisturizer to be honest which is
actually really nice because it does say
soft matte so I do want it to you know
like suck all of the moisture out my
face like my face doesn't feel like this
Harvard is it right now so wake up feels
so soft if I look up close to my mirror
it hasn't like filled in my pores or
anything I can still see them but it
feels and looks more smooth does that
make sense I mean I don't know I mean
it's a primer it's kind of hard for me
to give you eye is anything at the
moment but so far so good
I ain't mad at this not at all it is
time for foundation now she has freaking
killed it with the foundation she's come
out with forty shades forty shades I
don't get so funny I love how Rihanna
has managed to come up with forty shades
but other makeup brands yet haven't
quite been able to do that she's coming
for ya so the foundation is the pro
filter
soft matte long wear foundation I mix up
the color free 30 which was part of the
Motown range to be honest with you I
just guess they were you know I was
doing I was like that'll do so fingers
crossed Ashley matches
24 pounds for this which that is not bad
at all I've made more profound Asian in
that I think I paid like nearly 40 pound
for a foundation which 40 pounds like 24
pounds I don't think that's not also oh
and by the way you actually gets 32
million here which is actually two mil
more than the average foundation she's
not playin it says to shake well that
doesn't feel right music my left hand
okay so the claims on it are medium to
full coverage which I can test today
because my skin is uh try me long wear
and light as air so we're gonna test
that out now it does say it's a soft
matte finish and I'm not usually a matte
kind of girl to be honest I do prefer
more of a do we kind of finish because I
love to glow but then I do have oily as
skin so this could work I'm gonna use a
sponge to do it just to see if I can add
a little bit of moisture back in please
ignore the fact that this is one of the
ditty sponges I couldn't find my bigger
one so using the baby pumps on the back
of my hand I did two pumps pretty
liquidy though can you see that well
it's really dependent just move my hair
out the way cuz I don't want to get
something in it okay so the color is
definitely a bit too dark for me just
drag it down it's fine
if so then two pumps have covered the
bottom half of my face definitely medium
coverage though because I can still see
all of my like scarring through the
foundation it has oxidized pretty bad
like I'll show you this is the color it
went on as this is the color it is now
like it is oxidized I'm gonna switch to
a brush and see if it gives me bit
better coverage the good thing is it is
definitely buildable I've managed to
cover everything way better and I feel
like the brush actually gives you more
coverage I mean I don't really like a
Victoria sponge cake so with it you know
what I'm actually kind of liking this
part from the shade I should have gone
lighter for sure so guys free 30 is
pretty dark I should have gone a couple
shades lighter because one is kind of
dark in the first place and then two
oxidizes and I'm just like well that's
it the finish is actually really really
nice like I don't think I was gonna like
it because of the matte whole situation
but it still has a bit of life to it
look a bit of right I'm gonna go ahead
and quickly apply at some concealer they
did have a match stick which you can use
to highlight and conceal but I don't
really use them source stick thingamabob
a is just not really my kind of thing
yeah I'll be back one sec so I mean that
I've got concealer on the shade actually
isn't that bad like we're kind of it
it's working
boy if you consider I used the where's
it gone maybe even fit me one of my
faves if he was wondering what I used
for now it is time to cream corn
Laura this is one of her Matt
matchsticks Matt's matched it say that
10 times over in the color truffle now I
never really cream cut that skewer I
never really
colonists mana night out I usually
prefer powders but let's give this a go
this is what it looks like there is
something just so satisfying about a
fresh product how much do you get okay I
mean that's not awful
that's okay pop this way would you
usually do some contouring feels more
like kind of dry not dry I feel like
that's some pretty bad the consistency
is not as creamy as I thought it would
be but also about my truffle it's more
of the neutral shades it's not too warm
not too cool because I can not do ever
cool contour you guys I just look ashy
AF and it's just it's not you Oh
another way I mean it's definitely
blending but you do have to solve work
with it yeah it's not like my hoola
contour stick where I'm like don't but
then again it has done the job like kind
of got a little bit of a cheekbone going
on kind of I can wish I got too much of
a round face to have cheekbones let's
see if it dries quickly cuz this has
been on my skin for a little bit no not
really it's finished it's burning out
just as much as this one did so which is
cooks it's not one of those products
that you put on your face and then let's
just no going back like that ish is just
staying over there so basically you've
got blending time which I mean is nice
because there's only so quick that my
arm can blend I don't like it it is
definitely more only sort of thicker
side like a thicker what's this more of
a thicker consistency but having said
that it blended out nicely just need a
little bit more time to sort of work
with it but it doesn't look muddy it
doesn't look gross it doesn't look gross
it looks nice on the skin so yeah I
don't care before I go ahead and powder
my skin I have one more cream product to
test out so this is another matchstick
but this is - shimmer skin stick I got
really I pressed my point so it looks
exactly the same as the contour stick
I've heard they're magnetic that okay
that wasn't as smooth as I wanted which
I think that's so called like such a
good idea
the shimmer skin stick in
rippen oh okay that is a lot more pink
than I thought it would be oh wait
actually sort of rose gold you guys see
that it's like a golden rose sort of
color do I just do this kind of I don't
know I thought like they consistency I
bet I just want to warm it up with my
finger first and then apply it so I
think I'll do that I just felt like if I
go like this I'm gonna disturb my
foundation and stuff and I don't want
that
I can't really see anything happening I
can see a bit of a pink tint but I can't
actually see any sort of like glow like
where where are you I'm like I don't
know about this one you guys I like
where where are you I mean maybe I'm
just used to having a highlighter that's
like freakin BAM you know but this is
just not doing it for me
this is just not doing if me I don't
feel like this is necessary to be honest
I feel like if a powder highlighters are
banging then do you need this I don't
really think so it's sivir they're a
really subtle or I'm just blind I did
however pick up if I can find it one of
her powder
jirÃ´ highlighters so I'm gonna quickly
go ahead set my face on a little bit of
color and let's hope that this is a
little bit better and more blinding than
this because honey this wasn't doing it
for me so yeah I will be back in
literally three two one okay so I'm back
I also went ahead and just throw on some
eye makeup because she doesn't have any
eye makeup to test it out so I thought I
may as well if you were wondering what I
used I use a few colors from the violet
foster holy grail palette I used the
Ofra Brown gel liner fiber wing and then
my lashes aren't rodeo drive by a
backstage and then I just used the body
shop wonderful also completely forgot to
mention but the match sticks are 21
pounds each right okay so it is now time
to highlight my face because I'm feeling
a hello.mat right now I just don't like
you I need that highlight of my life
this is the so now I'm kilowatt
freestyle highlighted zero in mean honey
and hustler baby oh my god that's such a
cool name so this is what it looks like
it's that more golden tones highlighter
which I'm all for this one here looks
more hi Larry
so I'm going to use it hi Larry so a new
world okay RiRi don't have it go down
yes that was why I was like involved
like this this is a freaking highlight
Cupid's bow and nose can I like drown
myself in this is that okay this is
literally what I've been after this
whole time this didn't give me that
but this dead here's the highlights on
my hand so you can see so the one I used
is way more intense than this one which
I like because you get the option to
choose whether you want something like
mm or whether you want a little bit more
like sonÃ­s which is cool so it caters
for everyone I feel like it's 26 pound I
love the packaging I love the product I
feel like this is a moss or calm down
version to the really really gold
intense one that she has which I was
gonna pick up because that looks bomb
like it's so intense so I feel like I
would adjust look like I had a gold
streak on her face and I just want to
look funny whereas I feel like I'm
darker complexion that's gonna look so
hot and I feel like this is way more of
a subtle version it's still nice and
gold but a wearable girl look in my
opinion I feel like the super gold one
that she has is more of a editorial kind
of thing I still think is really cool by
but I love this I love this Ruby killed
it with the highlight she did that she
did this she did this then the last
thing I have to test out is her gloss
balm so it's a universal lip Luminizer
which I love a good gloss the packaging
yes askew
I think what I'm gonna do is try this on
by itself so you guys can see the color
and the gloss and then I'll take off and
put a lip color on and then put this on
top because that's what I would probably
typically do unless this looks like
really good by itself and I don't have
to do but well I think this is 16 pounds
which I feel like is kind of good it
looks like you get quite a lot of
products and X it's quite like chunky
chunky it's a little like it showed look
at it anyway whoa look at that doe fat
waking up like that is huge
oh you can that smells
that smells incredible it smells like
shore breeze just right oh actually did
it mm-hmm that's nice the applicator is
actually really easy to apply because
it's so big it's just like done it's
super glossy like super glossy not
sticky at all kind of a thick formula
but not sticking the color is just a
really really natural Tinh cute I
believe it like this
I think it's nice but I'm going to show
you what it looks like with a color on
underneath I'm gonna keep it nude
because the gloss is kind of a nude
color I do love a good nude as well I'm
throwing it back with a bit of Mac myth
do you like this lipstick gloss over the
top yes I liked it before but I rather
sorry much better okay so this is the
completed makeup look and you know what
RiRi did this I mean I have to give it
to her she is pretty much a smashed this
there's only a couple things which to
bonus I don't really care for but some
of the things I tried are amazing and
you can tell she's put so much thought
in consideration
insulate that I think that just makes it
ten times better if you are curious to
know I think you need in your life and
then like don't really feel like you
need like my three favorites have to be
at the highlighter the lip gloss and the
foundation if you want to get anything
from the collection at check these bad
boys out and then to be honest I don't
really care for sticks I don't feel like
the contour is bad at all I'm just not
really gonna reach for these they didn't
Wow me on it but oh my mind or anything
everything else I'm doubtful so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
