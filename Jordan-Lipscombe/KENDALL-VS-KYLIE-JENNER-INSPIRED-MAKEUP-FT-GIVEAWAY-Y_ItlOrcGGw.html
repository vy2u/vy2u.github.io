going to be a kind of kendall Jenner
versus Kylie Jenner makeup tutorial I
love both of their makeup they're just
so different to each other
and they're two of my favorite Jenner's

couple of their makeup looks that I've
seen on the internet and fell in love
with so for this video I'm actually
working with an app called double and

you've watched this video anyway so like
I said there's going to be a kendall
Jenner and Kylie Jenner makeup tutorial
I'm actually wearing the Kylie Jenner
one now I love them both their makeup is
completely different to each other as
well which was cool so Kendall's is a
lot more natural wears a lot less
whereas Kylie wears more she's a lot
more glam a lot more done up so I
thought be interesting to recreate both
looks now of course they both have
different makeup looks there's a billion
pictures
them wearing completely different makeup
looks but I chose two of my favorite I
will either put them on the screen
somewhere now so you can see the two
pictures that I actually went from so I
hope that you guys enjoy this video be
sure to head over to my double and vote
which one you would prefer I would love
to know I love you guys and let's get on
with the tutorial okay so we're gonna
start with the kendall Jenner inspired
makeup look so the first thing I'm gonna
do is take this Primark strobing cream
this is basically a liquid highlighter
and this is going to make a really nice
glowy base because Kendal always has
really Julie looking skin so I thought
this would be perfect and then for my
foundation today I'm taking the L'Oreal
Lumi magique foundation this is just
kind of sheer and glowy in the picture
she was literally wearing no foundation
because she had freckles and everything
so we're gonna keep it really natural by
only using a really small amount
and then to cover up these bags I've got
going on the camera is doing them
justice I'm taking the bareMinerals
serum concealer and just popping it on
underneath my eyes just to add like a
hint of color and taking the bodyshop
drops of sun these are amazing when you
want something really subtle in the
picture I don't think Kendall was really
wearing any kind of bronzer at all but I
have to wear a little bit of color on my
skin
and then here I just took my RC ma no
color powder I'm just sitting underneath
my eyes for the concealer and then I'm
just going to put a little bit in my
t-zone because I do get oily
now moving on to the eyes they were
really really simple so all I'm doing is
taking this makeup geek eyeshadow in
creme brulee and just whacking this in
the crease and then I'm going to take
the makeup geek eyeshadow in cocoa there
and just blend that all over the lid she
just had a really soft kind of smoky eye
going on so it's really easy
and then I took that same Coco bear
eyeshadow and I'm just going to blend
that really messily underneath the eye
I'm trying to fake the kind of kendall
Jenner big eyes so I'm just taking this
nude liner and putting it in my
waterline and then for mascara I'm
taking the L'Oreal voluminous 4 towel
and I'm just applying this generously on
my lashes because I'm pretty sure in the
picture she wasn't wearing any falsies
whatsoever so we're just going to work
with what we've got also guys any
products that I use in this video will
be linked in the description box so if
you want to know just check that out
for my highlighter I'm taking an oldie
but a goodie this is Mac soft and gentle
as you can see I'm applying it really
kind of carefree and all over my skin
I'm not really using this to kind of
highlight certain points I just want to
make the skin look really glowy and dewy
did you like that how many times were
you wanna try one should've noticed the
one and another's work for soulmate I
want to sort my best friends and then
the last thing the lips so she always
has ever really nude lips or even a red
lip but for this one I go for a nude so
I'm taking this retractable lip liner by
NYX in the color nude and I'm kind of
lining my lips filling them in slightly
and just blending out with my finger so
there's no kind of crazy color going on
it's nothing too intense it just looks
really natural and now it's time for the
fun part so in the picture kendall has a
freckles so I'm going to do some faux
freckles so I'm just dipping my brush in
a really soft cold brown pencil and I'm
just donning it all over my skin it
doesn't have to be perfect because
obviously freckles aren't perfect just
putting it in the kind of nose and upper
cheek area and that is the completed
kendall Jenner inspired makeup look I
hope that you guys liked it but now it's
time to do the Kylie Jenner one so the
first thing that I did was took the
Urban Decay all nighter foundation I do
actually have a first impressions of
this up on my channel which I will leave
links below if you're interested and
then for concealer I am using and I
think it's the next complete coverage
concealer it's really light it looks way
too light on camera right now but I
promise once everything's blended out it
bends in
and then I'm just going in with my
sponge and blending everything out
and once that's all bended in I'm going
to take the RCM a no color powder and
just bake the powder literally went
everywhere and then I'm just going to
set the rest of my face with that powder
as well
she actually has quite matte skin and
then she just highlights the higher
points of her face and now moving on to
the eyes I'm taking Peach Smoothie I
think that's a yeah and then I'm just
going to put that into the crease as my
kind of transition shade and then for
all over the lids I'm taking the color
that's called frappe and I'm just really
messily putting this all over just as a
kind of base for the other eye shadows
I
so I'm taking an angled brush now and
makeup geek corrupt which is their black
eyeshadow and I'm going to start lining
my upper lash line kind of starting to
wing it out just making that shape and
then I'm going to take a smudger brush
and like a dark brown eyeshadow and
start just smudging that owl to start
kind of getting that winged shape we
want everything to be really like
blended and smudged as her wing isn't
like a defined wing it's just a shadow
that's been blended out from start your
Bonnie I'm your crab from now to
eternity I give you all my heart we are
meant to be it's clear to see my love
and then I'm just taking a makeup wipe
and just cleaning that outer edge so
it's just nice and sharp and then of
course I'm just going to repeat the
exact same steps on the other eye
just pop in on a bit of mascara just do
prep my eyelashes for the falsies as
kylie jenner i think she literally wears
false eyelashes all the time just to
darken up the eyes even more i'm just
lining my waterline with a black
eyeliner this that's really gross I'm
sorry and then I'm just going to smudge
out the lower lashline with the same
frappe eyeshadow that we used all over
the lid earlier as it should a really
slow now smoky eye to bronze up the skin
I'm taking this makeup revolution kind
of contour palette and just taking the
bronzer shade in there and just start
warming up my skin she doesn't have any
kind of crazy contour and going on or
anything it's just really subtle on the
skin
just add a teeny bit more shading I'm
going to take this makeup geek contour
powder in the one that's called
half-hearted and just add a teeny bit
more kind of color and shape
to highlight I did use my trusty sleek
solstice highlighting palette I love
this and I'm just highlighting the
highest points of my face so that's my
cheekbones I'm also going to highlight
my nose and my Cupid's bow just the
usual places oh I did actually highlight
underneath the brow bone as well because
I noticed she actually had a pretty
intense a brow bone highlight going on
and so and also the inner corners now
for kylie jenner's famous lips now this
wouldn't be a Kylie Jenner tutorial if I
didn't over line so for my bottom lip
I'm actually not going to over line I'm
just going to keep that the same but I'm
gonna over line the top lip so I
actually have found the best way to over
line your lips is in the middle of the
Cupid's bow that's where you want to
over line and I actually rounded it off
so I don't really have a Cupid's bow
that gives them all kind of like plump
appearance and that's kind of what she
has and then down the sides of my lips I
follow my lip line so I find that's the
most natural way to over line your lips
you can't see your lip line so just over
line and at the Cupid's bow
you guys probably guess what I'm going
to use on the lips I'm going to take a
NYX lingerie liquid lipstick this is in
lace detail I just thought this is the
perfect like kinky brownie nude shade
for this tutorial
from start you'll not Bonnie and that
was my take on Kylie Jenner's makeup I
