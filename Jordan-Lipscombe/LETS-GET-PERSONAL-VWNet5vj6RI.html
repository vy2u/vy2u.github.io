today and film a Q&amp;amp;A video for you
because I haven't some one of these and
so long so I thought spend time I
actually asked you guys to send me in it
questions are way more like a personal
level between me and you because I don't
really share out of my personal life or
like my YouTube and my social media and
stuff well I do but like I don't
something cents and surprisingly a lot
of you are actually kind of interested
about my life of behind immense I guess
so I thought this would be the perfect
opportunity to do it and share with you
a little bit more about me on more of a
personal level I always say this which
as you know I am honestly the most
normal person would ever meet I'm just a
19 year old girl but I mean we all have
different lives and different stories
and backgrounds and stuff so I'm going
to a stop but intro Inc s controlling
basically I'm going to get into the
questions so the school so the first
question is what was your job before you
started at YouTube I actually worked at
somewhere called Tesco if you do live in
another country basically is just a
supermarket but I'm the one that I
worked that had a make up for partners
well so I worked on a makeup department
when I'm sold on food went back to maker
I was just back and forth I worked there
for just over two years so I actually
left school I didn't go to college or
anything went straight into work and
then Here I am now being so so blessed
to have YouTube as my full-time job I
was just a little too schooler but
honestly I'm actually so proud to say
that I was because it shows sort of
where I've come from I'm never going to
forget that and I know what reality is
like I guess okay so this next question
is so fab so it is do you ever feel
pressured by social media especially in
the way girls are portrayed as a way
they have to be if you do feel affected
by that then what do you do to try and
overcome the self-doubt and loss of
self-confidence love you go I wanted to
I don't put as much pressure now than I
did in the beginning when I first
started I was like holy crap like this
is this is a lot working but especially
on social media I saw that girls are
made out so just look a certain way be a
certain way have this plastic life when
in reality it's not like that with all
humans like that it's just not realistic
because I totally understand what you
mean I've been affected by it as well
especially as someone who lives their
life on social media like that's what I
choose to do and driving me wrong I
would never change it for the world
as far as overcoming that and overcoming
self-doubt and loss of confidence is you
have to remember we choose what we put
online you know your example on
Instagram I put on there pretty much all
positive stuff and like all of the good
stuffs because I'm a pretty positive
person and um I like to kind of spring
positive energy but I am a human being
and my life behind an Instagram page and
my life behind a camera is totally
normal
I have down days I have days where I
don't wanna leave the house I have days
where I just don't feel that good and
girls and boys let me tell you that is
so normal I promise you so my advice to
you guys on how to overcome that and
become a little bit more confident and
not worry about that so much is behind
the scenes is where all happens like
people just choose not to show that so
all I'm saying is when you see something
that maybe gets you a bit down whether
it's like a body image or to be anything
really just remember that that's not
entirely like the real the real deal and
that is not me saying that people are
fake going like that I do it myself up
obviously we're all human and we all
have lives you know and we all have
emotions but yeah don't worry about it
honestly your social media can sometimes
be a little bit deceiving but just
remember that you are sad there's only
one of you in the world embrace that
love that and don't free this next
question some of you may have actually
seen as the former makeup store or so
will know what this means but it is how
did you get that scar on your eyebrow if
you didn't know I do actually have a
scar through this eyeball here I can
just cover it up with a power of makeup
beside I actually got it I was just
being a little bit of a brat when I was
younger and actually jumped or fell I
don't already know I somehow come out of
my high chair and I hit my head on a
radiator so I split my head open so
gross now I have a permanent reminded of
how dumb I was as a kid I used to
actually be really embarrassed by it and
hate it but now I'm likely I would
embrace it I have a scar through my
eyebrow
cool funny thing is some people used to
think I actually just show
used a bit of my uber off and I was like
what when I was like three for like the
usual but yeah that's the story of that
did you deal with any bitchy girls slash
bullies in school yes I love you so much
I love you too I yeah I think a lot of
us have to be honest the cecum from my
personal experience I was actually
bullied in school unfortunately which
made my last couple years of school I
like a living hell I hated school I
always talked about it too much because
honestly I try just to take the positive
out of it because it's made me the
person I am today like it's made me
realize my self-worth it's made me learn
to accept myself and kind of be Who I am
it may not sound like that at the time
but now looking back totally has made me
a better person from it but that's just
no excuse for it because at the end of
the day bullying is wrong and there's no
need to be a bitch basically but I need
you guys to remember and I have to tell
you from someone who's experienced
verbal doing herself and it all started
online like this is way before YouTube I
promise you whether it's verbal physical
whatever it gets better time heals
emotion I promise you how I know that is
not any of our experienced it myself but
think about it like you may wake up some
morning and feel happy and others it's
because tomorrow next week you don't
know how you're going to feel you know
never give up because I promise you it
does get better it's just a temporary
feeling and your life will change and
your emotion will change with that I
promise we've got this question is sorry
but Q it is what do you love most
we don't know Elliot is if you're new to
my channel Elliot is actually my
boyfriend we've been together for four
months now but I thought I'd have known
in my whole life what do I love most
about earlier to know what Elliot is the
most uplifting and positive person and
he is so supportive of everything I do
he's just so caring like he knows how to
bring my moon it up he always says how
proud of me is and it's amazing having
someone with that kind of energy and
make sure you want to be better as a
person is the best feeling ever
and he's amazing little is a person
really lucky so cool you mix the little
teacher he's a good'n have you ever met
a youtuber who is really different in
real life than they are on camera yeah
but don't get me wrong that you could be
just because someone
meeting new people for the first time
inclining simmer vexing and if you're
shy totally normal but just how could I
put it all I say is some people have
surprised me a lot not only for my own
experience but I've heard about the same
people from other people that make sense
and a little bit a little bit weird I'm
talking people with fewer subscribers
and a way more I just don't get it I
don't think a number to find you as a
person I don't think it makes you better
than anybody else but I don't know
where's your diet Josh Fitness cuz girl
you look good thank you
I'm going to be real with you guys keep
it real I don't have long so I work out
regularly absolutely not do I eat a
certain way absolutely not
I slapped so hard when it comes to
working out now I actually have been
meaning to get a gym membership for so
long I used to go ages ago I stopped and
then I started doing at home workouts
which has probably helped me out a lot a
lot of the recent mate girl I've been
slacking it's very bad because I feel
like I should be giving you guys more
information to help you but I don't do
that shot when I do work out I like to
look at cardio and then I do have some
fun because they're my two favorite
places to work out as far as diet goes I
just come some sober but I literally
just eat whatever I see I probably
shouldn't but sometimes the pizza just
sounds way too good dinner salads out
here I think it comes to diet balances
employment and then when it comes to
fitness consistency is important like
the two two things this next one is
sexualities whether I'm into boys girls
anything in between whatever they go on
if I am what you would call straight so
I am into guys I'm into the opposite sex
but sexuality doesn't matter it doesn't
define you as a partner and dukkha like
whoever you want whether it's the same
sex opposite sex it doesn't matter love
is love right but yeah I personally I'm
into men the sex one is do you consider
yourself as a confident female in a
world of stereotyping and if so how do
you build that confidence good question
I know how hard it is growing up in a
society or world where stereotyping and
being a certain way and looking a
certain way is a thing these days and
different is not as accepted
weird watch what I'm saying is
sometimes it's hard to feel confident
and know your self-worth because of the
world that we live in which is so sad
because that's not how it should be but
I find me considering myself as a
confident female I wouldn't consider
myself a confident female only because
those days right still like that but
I've learned that this is a point I'm
going to be in for the rest of my life
like you ever accept it and be a lot
happier or you don't
and obviously we'll bring you down but
just changing our mindset and thinking
hey like this is who I am this is who
I'm going to be for the rest of my life
and you know what I'm going to have to
love that I'm going to embrace that and
I'm going to rock it by doing that it
does not make you cocky it is not making
up yourself it's far from that in fact
the complete opposite and all you're
really doing is making two middle
fingers up to how society says that we
should be it's not going to happen
quickly that trust me I'm still learning
but just learn to be you and let that
shine through because you are amazing so
this christening is a little bit juicy
so is how much do you get paid and by
the way love you sorry is invasive I
love you too and a lot is a question
obviously I'm not going to give you guys
figures because that is personal to me
but I can't share with you how I get
paid and where my money comes from
YouTube is my full-time job I am so so
blessed to have sex it is my dream job
and obviously money isn't the most
important thing but it's a factor
because it is what I do this is how I
live in it so I get paid through ads and
through use from YouTube and then I get
paid through sponsorships now between
the two sponsorships is where the money
is that all I can say and the money
changes all the time there's so many
things it can depend on so it depends on
the brand it can depend on the job that
you do everything but usually
sponsorships is where where it is now it
changes month by month depending how
many jobs they do in it was a depends on
my views but because of that I don't
know how much money I'm going to earn a
month because obviously depends how many
job so do and the views I guess any bad
thing about YouTube is you don't know
how much exactly I'm going to earned bah
okay this one is a little family
question it is do you ever want to have
kids love you I love you too so of
course I was up okay that was the chair
I'm shocked and every single type of
cause I love to have my own family one
day like as much as like little Jordan's
running around
like I car and I'd actually like to have
two kids I am in no rush so I am only 19
I forgot the rest of my life ahead of me
but I do kind of want them between mid
to late 20s obviously I don't know if
that's going to happen you just kind of
go with life life so you're kind of
places I do want to convey but honestly
the pain like I will talk about this for
a second about how other people do it I
have the lowest pain tolerance ever
lecture on pitch with Mia like how am I
going to deal with like a child cut No
yeah but no will you ever make your own
makeup around who knows maybe I love
makeup so why the heck not right like
maybe one day maybe you have to ask stay
tuned to find out got a youtube question
so how is being on YouTube impacted your
life has it made you a better person
what advice would you give to someone
who would like to start YouTube channel
in the future oh we're going to few
little questions in there it has 100
percent no doubt changed my life for the
better in all aspects really it's made
me a better person in the sense of like
coming out of my shell a lot more if you
watch my first video for now you can see
I am way more like I style myself I
guess I've not changed as a person
Knossos doing you dress like that's very
important to mention I'm still Jordan
I've just come out my shell a lot more
and I've found myself and the advice
that I've give to any of you at future
youtubers out there would be one go for
it into a care about what people think
because life's way too short for that
craft and the second thing is do what
you love because then things combined
make an amazing thing and that's when
YouTube is done for all the right
reasons and when it can take off in all
the right ways you know there's not
really much advice because there's no
sort of recipe to do in YouTube it's not
like you have to do this this and this
and then see you're like where you want
to be it takes time it's a hard place to
be because so many people do it which is
totally amazing but keep at it and go
for it and do what you love and Bob's
your uncle you'll be good I'm gonna
making a makeup videos what else do you
do in your everyday life by the way
you're so beautiful so calm thank you so
much so I am just your everyday pray
ruch 19 year old girl I love to seen
people I love so I'll see my family
