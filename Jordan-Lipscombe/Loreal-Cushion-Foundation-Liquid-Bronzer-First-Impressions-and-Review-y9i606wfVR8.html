first impressions on the new L'Oreal
nude magique cushion foundation and also
the glam bronze cushion bronzer as well
now I think I bought these about two
weeks ago roughly but I've only go
around to filming it because I have been
on holiday which is why more tanned so
that is why I'm only firming it now but
I mean better late than never right it's
just a really nice kind of circle
compact so I think it's really travel
friendly and then when you open up you
have a really nice sized mirror in there
as well and I'll give you guys a quick
close up off the packaging so you can
see exactly what it looks like so it
just has a little top bit which holds
one of these sponges I never really use
these myself but I mean it's there if
you want to and and then you just open
it up at the side here and you have the
cushion liquid foundation inside and
then like I said the bronzer is just
exactly the same just a bronzer I think
these are originally about 15 pounds
each I got them when they just come out
and they were on offer for buy two for
fifteen pounds but I have a feeling
they're like 15 pounds each which is
pretty pricey for a drugstore foundation
I'll be honest I'm just going to go
ahead and look online at the claims of
what this is really supposed to do so
right this foundation it says discover
liquid foundation revolutionised with
the nude magique cushion foundation our
first cushion drenched in liquid
foundation for an ultimate fresh nude
finish in a tap and it says also you
might be able to customize your coverage
so tap a little for a sheer luminous
finish or tap a lot for medium buildable
coverage it's also available in seven
shades and it's got SPF 25 in which is
actually really high for a foundation
and then a quick rundown on the bronzer
as well what it really says is it's a
bronzing cushion that illuminates skin
to reveal a Julie sunkissed finish and
it also says you can get a customizable
glow the more you tap the more your tan
glows perfect oh I guess the first thing
that I'm going to do is just prime half
of my skin and so you can see if a
primer makes a difference in the
long-term
see and also the application of the
foundation and the bronzer itself I'm
going to use my Nivea men post shave
balm as my primary also this is probably
a really good time to test out this
foundation as well because I actually
have like a really red nose and a red
forehead I did get sunburned on holiday
woops minds are kind of like kill nearly
I guess it's all sort of dry skin
patches which is annoying that it's
going to pale but I guess it's good to
see if the foundation will emphasize
them or if it will cover up the redness
and all of that feels so weird
applying any primer to half my skin so I
guess I'm just going to go ahead and
start applying this now and you're meant
to sort of take this applicator and kind
of like press it into the foundation and
then just press onto a skin but I really
don't like these kind of applicators
I'll be honest with you I mean it's up
to you personally but I'm going to use a
brush for this and maybe a sponge maybe
I'll use a sponge and a brush so you
guys can see what one works better I
guess I'm going to go ahead and actually
use this applicator I really don't like
things like this but it does come with
the products I'm going to see how well
it works and then after that I probably
will move on to a brush because that's
just how I prefer to apply my
foundations as opposed to these little
things smizing the colour 0 7 I'm not
sure if it's going to match me have a
feeling could be a little bit too light
but will work with there is the
foundation that's the most important so
you meant to just go ahead and push this
in to get the liquid foundation that's
actually quite a little products on
there and then you want to go ahead and
just start tapping this onto your skin
the idea that these sponging about kind
of like three times n and that has given
quite nice coverage actually it is
struggling on these sort of dry patches
of skin at the top of my head but I mean
that's from like sunburn it's not dry
skin so it's quite severe I guess but I
mean it hasn't done bad at all really
what I'm going to go ahead and do now is
just take a brush and apply it on this
side of my face to see if the coverage
is any better or to see if it applies
maybe a little bit better on these dry
patches
so this is kind of one thin layer of
foundation on my skin it is a little bit
of a different color but once I pour the
rest of my makeup on you shouldn't be
able to tell one thing I will say is
this isn't a bad applicator this sponge
I'll be on this isn't bad it didn't do a
bad job but I find a brush is so much
quicker and and it sort of blends a
little bit easier like that so that was
one thin layer and it's actually giving
me really nice coverage one thing I have
noticed though for being like a fresh
and glowy foundation it has clung a lot
to the dry patches on my skin I'll try
and zoom in so you guys can see on my
forehead so I hope you guys can see
where it is clung a lot onto my forehead
like all these soft patches up here now
for the sake of the video I'm going to
go in with a little bit more and see if
I can make it kind of more buildable my
forehead and my nose where it's more red
and then maybe in this area hips it's
quite red here too
so that has builded quite nicely on my
skin it doesn't look really heavy
everything still looks really fresh but
it is still struggling to kind of hold
on to the drier areas on my face which
is weird because it's supposed to be a
glowy like a fresh looking foundation so
not sure why II it's clinging as much as
it is like if you guys can see on my
nose at all I mean that's what you get
when you get sunburned so overall it
doesn't look really nice on the skin
maybe as the day goes on it will get
there we will see but I'm not it at the
moment I'm going I don't think it's a
bad foundation at all now I'm going to
move on and try the bronzer as well now
you do get a sponge with this but I
really don't want to use that for my
bronzer because it's just an awkward
shape so all I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go in with a brush like this
and just tap it in very like how can you
describe that it's very like for a
bronzer it's very like neutral toned
actually
that was really really nice to blend and
I barely had to really do anything and
it did it really really nicely it's a
really nice color as well it's not too
warm it's not too cool it's like that
perfect neutral in between which I love
and it looks really really natural
actually I really like that feel up
really nicely it still looks like it
ends on how much color you like on your
face really and what you're used to but
it definitely can be built up nicely so
you can get a really soft glow or
something a bit more intensive natural
thing and that is really made a
difference to my face I feel like and
it's really kind of brought the color
back in as well and it's made the
foundation like this matches so much
better already than it did just the
foundation that's really really nice I'm
happy with that
so I'm going to do is I'm quickly going
to go off-camera and finish up the rest
of my makeup and I'll be back in a
second okay so I've just finished my
makeup and I have to say everything
looks so good like everything blended so
easily on top nothing was patchy always
fun any way that once foundations have
been sitting on your skin for a while
and kind of settled down that it looks
nicer anyways but no my skin looks
really nice if this holds up if this
lasts a long time on my skin this could
be a new fave dumi well it is now what's
the time now it is 12:57 right now so
I'm going to go about my day and then
come back in a few hours and let you
guys know how the foundation and the
bronze art is holding up okay so I am
back it is now quarter past five and
it's been on for what just over four
hours now I have started to get a little
bit kind of oily in my t-zone so my
forehead in the sides of my nose here
it's nothing crazy though I feel like
obviously with the lights shining on it
I feel like it looks a lot shinier than
it actually is
it doesn't like transfer off when I
touch the kind of oilier places which is
always a good thing but no it looks
really really nice on the skin and my
bronzer and everything is still there my
highlights still there which
go in with a little bit of translucent
powder and just sort of press over the
places that was starting to get a little
bit oily it still looks very similar to
earlier just how to touch up so I'm
going to go ahead and carry on with the
rest of my day and come back in a few
more hours and do a final check in with
you guys so I see you all in a bit okay
so I just thought I would come outside
into daylight so you can see in natural
lighting also I'm going to insert a
picture of me using this in flash
photography because this is SPF 25 so
we'll see if it has any flash back as
well or insert a picture now my hair is
crazy so I'm back to do a final check in
with you guys it is some time it is 5:00
to 10:00 at night so this has been on
for a total of about nine hours I think
so it's been on for a decent at a time
but I am ready to take this makeup off
you guys not because I don't like it
just because you know it gets that time
of day and you just want to just just
wipe everything off it has got oilier
again which a little bit annoying but I
find that after three or four hours this
does get oily and I have combination to
normal skin so if you're all your skin
just bear that in mind
so the dry skin patches have started to
get a little bit kind of like how can I
describe that it looks a bit like
cracked does that make sense I don't
know it just doesn't look as nice as it
did earlier
so our first corn is the price point of
this foundation this is pretty expensive
for a drugstore foundation it to me is a
bit too expensive a bit too highly
priced I kind of think the fifteen
pounds a lot of it comes from kind of
the whole cushion I did like the news of
packaging and something different and
fun and you know that's what I think a
lot of it comes down to as opposed to
the product inside
don't get me wrong I'm not going to sit
here and bash the product because I
honestly do like it and for kind of
Jewish foundations this is definitely at
the top of my list for jury foundations
because it is one of the best but just
as a drugstore foundation in general I
don't know if
fifteen pounds is kind of reasonable you
have to be careful of your skin type
with this one so if you have oily skin
combination you have to be careful
because you do have to touch up quite a
bit I mean I like my glow but not this
much but I think if you have dry skin
you would love this I feel like this
could be a fave the first good thing I
would have to say about this foundation
is the lasting power of it is really
nice for a jury foundation I don't think
they lost on me at all after a few hours
I can see them wearing off and looking
kind of like patchy resist when it goes
oily but it hasn't moved around it just
looks a little bit shiny and it's lasted
really really well so it's also it's
really really easy to blend and it looks
really kind of healthy and glowy on the
skin and it feels lightweight as well
doesn't look cakey easy to build so it's
got that customizable coverage which we
all love because we've all got different
skin types we've all got different skin
problems and things so it is nice to be
able to adapt the coverage so it works
for you now I just want to throw in the
bronzer quickly as well I do really like
this I think it's so cool that you have
that sort of liquid bronzer and also I
feel like this is just something you can
just work on it takes literally seconds
to put on and you've got that color and
that glow so I really like this again
this is a bit price is 15 pounds but I
feel like it could be something that
lasts a long time up there I hope you
