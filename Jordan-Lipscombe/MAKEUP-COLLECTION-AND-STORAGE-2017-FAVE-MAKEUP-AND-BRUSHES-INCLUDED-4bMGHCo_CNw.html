channel I hope you're all doing a sad I
am filming probably labor is highly
requested video that I've ever had on my
channel behind me is my current makeup
the collections that is exactly on
filming today our my my makeup
collection and storage of 27 feet I'm
sorry but it took me so long I thought
I've finally got my makeup collection
looking stored how I kind of want it so
I feel like you know what yours just of
it I do actually also store my skin care
and hair care stuff here as well I just
want to mention a little something
before we begin just so I can kind of
clear that off so you know the comments
section is not you know I feel like
every youtuber says this but like it's
cool let me show you my makeup
collection this is in it no way me
trying to brag whatsoever I am super
grateful and super thankful but every
single bit of makeup that I own I know
if our lucky to have the collection I
have just let me know it's just a super
highly requested I don't think it can be
really informative because I get to show
you guys it's I love and why use the
most and all that jazz oh yeah thanks
only thing I have to say yes Silas did
it let's show you my makeup so here is
the overview of what my little makeup
area looks like as I go out show you
guys where everything is from like
storage and stuff and also a bits of
makeup in that as well but and then I
start with the white draws first I'm
sure you have all seen these before they
are just the Alex drawers from Ikea I
got two sets of the nine and two sets of
the five I literally think everybody on
YouTube store their makeup in these bar
honestly they work so it's got to be
done so pretty much the two toilet rolls
in the middle is where I store my makeup
the little drawer to your guyses left is
waste on my hair and I'll know drawer to
the right is where I saw my skincare but
obviously we're going to focus on makeup
in this video and then I have the two
lipstick towers sitting on the little
drawers and my brushes on the spot I
think the order that I'm going to do
this in is I'm going to show you the
makeup in the drawers at first and then
I'll show you everything on top of the
drawers after her drawer number one I
have all of my primers and setting
sprays the back is more of my second
spray and the front is Primus so it's
very happy to say about 3:1 which is why
my fav
max prep and prime which again is one of
faces are different side but primal
what's up this one is a Primark one here
which trainers I'm not much on saddles
but what can you do the elf makeup mist
and set the body shop make up saying
spray and be fully shot victim in II
facial mist by the way this is a really
really a tube for six plus so if you are
looking for something similar to this
but double pays sequoias for it try to
smile at the front knee i have products
like a benefit professional which this
is probably my all-time favorite primer
along with the two thinking over rx1
excuse effect i lost the lid so looking
at the hourglass veil primer the MBK
addi slick complexion primer dr. Braun
applause no more the body shop in
services very good drugstore one benefit
professional Maps rescue office we've
got another little elf product here I
also have many of your men at post shave
balm this with a saying back in the day
this is what everybody used as their
primer I really reach for this that much
anymore but I mean it's very wanton I've
a backup of the to face forever brothers
you can almost them pretty sure these
are next yeah Nick shine killer and
Nick's for seller I also have the body
shop instrument which by the way through
an audio legal you will love their she
need this little guy again it has no lid
I swear a loose them into everything on
its a and then I'll see I keep the for
sorry for Sally Sally however you say
this rose gold elixir because to be
honest I used to suppress for my skin
anyway so keep that little guy in there
and that is this drawer done this second
drawer is the start of my foundation
collection this shows a little bit more
organized so basically all these
foundations here on my go to and then
these under the back are ones I haven't
tried yet so it just sort of separates
them and that's me know what's what so
the go-to foundations I have the UM
decay or note I have it in three
different shades here turning down here
in the corner I have the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer and
also this is the iconic London
foundation stick by the way the
Foundation Center coverage is bomb so if
you'd a control really good coverage
check these out another really good
foundation coverage finish everything
Izzy Makeup Forever HD foundation stick
this is one of my faves and as you guys
can see I am almost out like look it's
like hanging in there but that makes me
really sad then underneath I have the LA
girl Pro coverage HD foundation this is
really nice for a drugstore foundation
it's read Chloe
the Marc Jacobs remarkable which the
coverage on this bad boy it's for real
I've said this in a video before this
issue's expensive but it's worth it
L'Oreal True Match which is my favorite
drugstore foundation and then I have the
derma Col makeup cover I'm sure you guys
have heard all about this this stuff is
all ours coverage look for it on the
skin there and it's really cheap as well
so then I have this cool thing here this
is actually a foundation I use this a
couple videos ago this is the la splash
ultra definition cream foundation looks
like this it's another cool how cool is
that I'm pretty sure this is the elf
flawless finish foundation
I don't actually really like this it's
just in here cuz it like sits in the
step nicely the SS stay all day long
lasting and makeup this is for your 4
pounds and no joke
this is really good how do you think
about this if the color range is gooey
and then these here K this is my old
school foundation Revlon Colorstay love
this stuff is for the oily to
combination skin because I'm an honest
bacteria seeing that it tries to be our
serum foundation easily benefit
professional this thing I don't know it
looks like that and then I have a couple
of the loo main CC color correcting
cream really really to try these because
I've never found a CC or a BB cream that
I've liked so I'm hoping that these in
the back here these all guys will work
for me cry market and then this is a
blooming beauty serum and in a corner
here this is so handy to have if I can
actually get it out I have this little
tray in a spatula as well so I can mix
foundation scoop them out whatever I
need so I have it all palette so this is
so handing on to the next drawer I'm
pretty sure this is more foundations yep
here we go there is quite a lot
happening in this drawer I did have
three drawers a foundation and not two
but I needed more space try to kind of
squeeze it into one basically this is
the rest of my collection so I have the
NYX
total control drops here I have four
shades in the corner not actually really
try these yet so I've one to try the
essence soft touch mousse and the
L'Oreal new magic cushion a bunch of the
NYX Pro foundation mixes these things
make your foundation lighter darker
change the tone change the finish really
handy to have actually and then I have
the Knicks see maps for north flap
foundation in the corner here as you can
see I have a bunch like literally a
bunch come and hold them oh my god they
just gone for days these things look
like oh my god
Saanich in a mandolin back here a couple
of balls are healthy makes a couple of
it the auto shop we've got some L'Oreal
like l'oreal infallible we have here
Primark from up foundation sticks we
also have the maybelline luminous and
smooth and maps and process oh this is
the anyway skins to find that perfect
yeah that is pretty much what's in
mental now for the broad rule as you can
see again there is a lot going on in
here
to be honest I'm not mad at the straw I
quite like it I do have a good eye rep
on it though you can probably sell
hopefully you can see it's divided in
select three different sections so we
have pomade in this one pencils in this
one gels here and then powders hair
stylist promos this is one my favorite
products to fit in my brothers who have
been mixed payment brooms this is a
Oprah gel here I'll have some freedom i
document in medium at brown this is one
of my favorite things ever cinnamon roll
is first part about it as well as
drugstore so can't go wrong here we have
some of the benefit cobrowse this is
there are bottle made if you jumbo
spending a little bit more this is so
worth it this is one of the best points
i have ever used and then under them are
some of the NYX brow gels in a bunch of
different colors the middle there is a
little bit going on I keep on top though
the ones I'd reach for the most of the
benefit precisely my brow pencil and the
goof proof amazing is this pretty my
favorite brow pencil and I don't usually
use brow pencil so there's a lot in
there is a bunch of the NYX micro brow
pencil there which a really good
drugstore brow pencil cuz it's nice and
send as an elf brow pencil chaotically
lot in London arch-rivals I have a bunch
as you can see of the NYX eyebrow
pencils and also a bunch of the Loreal
brow artist expert one what else is in
here and soap &amp;amp; Glory archery brow
pencil another really good drugstore one
put these back you know home after brow
gels I have some of the NYX tinted brow
mascaras of x-5 color this is a elf one
also have the benefit conditioning
primer and this is the benefit free
Dubrow zones which is I get into drama
scar as well benefit gimme brow which is
a really amazing brow
l-like ooh look how pretty this brush is
it works amazingly I kind of have a
color here getting a couple either brow
amplifiers these are really pigmented
like they have a lot of color to them
which is amazing but I don't really
reach for ones with a lot of color look
but can you see that oh this is a
benefit of high brow pencil and then I
have these two which are called random
lil ones
eyebrows houses and rural kids live here
these are the ones I reach for the lease
which is why they're at the back never
any fill in my eyebrows with powders and
that I just I don't know they just don't
work that well for me I have them in
case you know one day I want to try
something new or I do like my family's
makeup on my friends whatever so I have
some of the remote brow this way little
brow wand powder thingies these guys
scare me a little bit I'm not going to
lie the whole one thing I know your guys
the even rattle okay that's really
annoying action story there is a little
body shop where I'll kick back here this
is a Primark brow kit here is a elf gel
and powder I broke it benefit down here
benefit growling growling - that's such
a cool name and then underneath these is
a well a lot a London arch rival bracket
which comes with oh my god there's mini
tweezers in here you guys see that
that's so cute to be completely honest
with you I think I have enough for our
products to run my own brow shop you
know on to the net we got a bunch of
concealers here's just another factor
this is higher like oh how annoying is
that rather here we have just nor
casinos you know irregular skin tones
such as northern color coat and stuff so
start with the front more you know your
regular everyday consumers in the corner
here when I say it's Maybelline fit me
these are looking really sad like I need
to us get some more of these because
they are running well this here at the
anartha radiant creamy which to be
honest this is exactly the same as the
Maybelline fit means in my opinion a
bunch of the LA Oh at protein fields
here these are amazing and they're super
affordable as well
they are Decay Naked skin concealer
which is amazing too and then I have a
few shades of the collection lost in
perfection which everybody has talked
about these never there is this kick-ass
concealer little kit from smokin Florrie
what else and else lime miss Fossey
Lumine NYX and a bare minerals best skin
concealer then here is all be a new
benefit concealer to the Boyne one so we
have
airbrush industrial-strength post racing
and brightening so I have a bunch of the
met them sub one as you can see it goes
on because of the days so around the
mill L ago what one here this isn't same
at the pigment amounts take a look you
need the smallest amount at all to let
the only Kate naked skin color X's and a
full pool okay just person for a
kick-ass one and then over here I have
this collection conceal and light like a
pro concealer palette BAM
next is my how to draw this is probably
what I have the least of tiberias which
is kind of surprising because in my
opinion powders is what makes your
makeup last but I don't know I just
don't find that exciting so I have loose
at the front up press at the back first
one is the Cody Asche I'm pretty sure
this would be trying to loosen extra
coverage yes he loved this up I also
love the Too Faced Born This Way of
setting powder as well such a good loose
powders are CMA another really good one
I also have a selection of Shelly's
party in translucent again this is like
two to three pounds sports this one here
this is benefit here we have the body
shop elf Nick I don't really reach for
the elf in the next one because they
have silicone which means that they
flush that really annoying because they
make the skin look so smooth so good but
see maybe a fitting that importance is a
really good press powder along with the
undecayed must apply on the slick must
front padded up freezer this is actually
an mu a powder it's just them the right
is like see you climb up one here and
that is it for the shore
simple well there okay this drawer here
is one of my faves because it is just
full of highlighters oh I know I have a
little bit of a problem to submit a bit
so this drawer pretty much contains a
lot of highlighters that I reach for on
an everyday basis I pretty much my faves
let's do this starting this corner here
so I'm a bunch of the iconic London
illuminator
drops how many do I have here six six
that is an issue
now I'm only kidding I love this stuff
so much I have it in different shades
this is so good for not only the face
for the body as well because I like to
blow everywhere so this stuff is amazing
little swatch for you guys you can see
like
okay at the top here I have this body
shop with drops of glow illuminating
drops obviously the packaging is really
cute
reminisce with you it reminds me of the
iconic London drops by a more subtle
version pretty cute here I have some
powder one so I have my Ofra blissful
which can we please just talk about the
fact of this broke and it went
everywhere look like little sad and use
this is I really need to get another one
because can we just
hi r.i.p but it's so good that I like no
and I have a couple of these seek
palette solstice and Cleopatra amazing
drugs oh hello probably the best I have
a little elf 1q a couple of the ejector
style ones here I have a little Kiko one
in the front here these two are probably
a couple of my favorite highlighters as
well so this is a UA one and the makeup
for everyone so this is the issue a
highlighter in the color through path
which looks like this our swatch it for
you guys
amazing Viet makeup for a pro like
fusion in gold which this is so smooth
it's so pigmented do you need both of
them in my opinion yet but probably not
macro soft and gentle I'm pretty sure
this is one of my fave highlights ever
clearly I have a benefit dandelion
highlighter as my name once you guys see
this look at us oh my god this one is
more like a pinky color highlighter and
it's way more subtle but it is really
pretty when you just want a little like
close to the skin that case you can see
a bit of a BH can't go wrong with a bit
of a BH I have a couple of our glow kits
so I have these fund it running it oh
this is a promo point I'll show you this
in a sec no Cold War era pilot this is
incredible she did such an amazing job
with this make a revolution ultra pro
quo palette which this for 10 pounds you
guys you need it then the prime up on
this is four pounds you get four
different shades and can we please just
talk about that
so what wait what can we and again what
I have a couple more liquid highlighter
so from glory we've got benefit L'Oreal
then there is way more highlighted in
this troll so there is a bunch of the
NYX liquid highlighters here some of the
duo cremes from NYX as well these are so
cool this is a nu a luxe glow beam
highlighting powder in gold this is so
cool so
we're stick and they like to shave some
of the highlight iron to the top okay
it's actually pretty good as well or if
you're looking for a soup of gold
highlights are check out this L'Oreal
one it looks like it this and basically
as you can see so gold feels like a
cream but grows on like a powder it is
the smoothest thing I've ever felt in my
life as you can see mine is really well
of LA go highlight here Beauty pie one
autograph a cover of X and then back
here I have an amazing Oprah palette
which is like full of highlighters like
check that out if this is not the best
thing you've ever seen in your life then
I don't know what is I for highlighters
are just insane I'd recommend them to
anybody
also please enjoy this like it's really
I'm sorry but I love it nippon top
highlight palettes here this is a urban
decay illuminated trio which honestly I
don't really like this it's way too
glittery for me I don't mind this one
but these two I'm like no SOS you
Suzanne Jackson highlight I can't use
this in a video really like this over
here I have a couple of the L'Oreal True
Match highlighters also happy as
Smashbox I think with Casey Holmes
highlight palette it looks like this and
then as a couple of Primark ones there
as well and that is pretty much it for
the highlighters fast then that the last
drawer on this site has all of my blush
in as you can see there's not a lot
going on here I'm not really a blush a
girl to be honest it's probably three or
four that I reach for all the time in
here but it's nice you just have a
variety so when I do my videos and stuff
you know I can switch things up so to
the left and mix bright idea
illuminating the stick these are
basically cream blushes which are really
nice but they have gone to them a couple
of the MUA of brushes back here these
are only one pound one pound they're a
little bit powdery but one pound
the middle section here contains my
favorite brushes the benefit California
this is like an all-time save Russia for
sure
never favors the Milani baked blush in
Luminoso I also really like the Sigma
core DeRosa blush and also the soap &amp;amp;
Glory
peach parting actually really like this
token when it's like a blush and
highlighter in one same as the body shop
for shimmer waves and V hello make a
revolution highlights I just has a
little bit of color and glow correct
hiding under here is the urban decay
task they go
blasphemes fetish toys oh my god this is
Mac harmony brush everybody uses as
contour back in the day then service
area to the right I have a couple of the
MUA Lux the lush palettes these are
really really pretty a lofty London
blush this is another autograph but I'm
pretty sure this is a cream Oh cheeky
little Sigma one it back here and then
it kind of makeup revolution ones right
down here at the back which you guys
can't see that there is a Nick sweet
cheeks palette which has a bunch of
different colors in and then I also have
a Oprah book again ignore the fact this
is dirty like I'm a mess but honestly
this is just a book of blushes like to
that so many different colors and that
guy's completes the blush draw on to the
next after all so in the first one here
I have all of my kind of single contours
bronzers that kind of thing anything
that isn't seeing all these little body
shop console palettes here but they just
amo see here so I just put them in them
this corner here has a bunch of cream at
contour sticks as a makeup revolution
one here dark mix bright idea once open
glory effigy you know I have my fav
thing this is the benefit who are
quickie contour state this would be best
cream thick console thingy my Bobby it
is sorry pigmented but it's so creamy it
bends out like a tube could die no go
back there you go collection precision
contouring never really reach for these
but err okay and I have at the front
here some of the body shop honey bottoms
of drops of the Sun but in this section
here this is what when I go to most
reach for Rhonda's contours all that
jazz sit at the front here we have a
couple orbit benefit who learns because
you can't go wrong with these these are
classic because a little mini one look
at this just in the corner actions - was
on there's a pee on the end don't ask me
why because my name is just Jordan let's
go but bridges pretend us on this one
here you see at Too Faced chocolate
Soleil which is another favor of mine or
you shot a bronzy be seen you make up
forever pro like fusion in at 25 L this
is honestly one of my favorite brands as
ever the color is incredible
I actually have a backup in the back
here who is no good a couple of the body
shop performs is here in two different
color 0 for their choice ting want to
see such a good brands are for the price
so good NYX matte bronzer in
the turn I'm pretty sure and then this
here on the goal I remember there's I'm
pretty sure this is almost first
high-end bronzers actually maybe even
the high-end product I ever owned
I love it I really should repurchase
excite I'm back to be honest
oh I've so many blunders here now though
I love that I have unless you thought
about getting this again that it is
really fat at the back I have my little
makeup geek Z palette and just hold some
of my contour and blush colors they're
just single pants that's easy just to
keep them in here I have two freakin
huge funders that honestly I'm pretty
sure these are big as my head makeup
revolution at chocolate heaven I think
this is litchi gonna last me a lifetime
and this is pur cosmetics one here which
I think this is like a really subtle
bronzer but oh my god that is so soft
but if you guys can even tell by the pan
there's such a soft formula and that
concludes my little single foreigners
are collections so I should close this
we can move on to the next the second
drawer host all of my contour palette
again I keep a couple of my favorites on
top so I can easily reach them actually
I can see if I make a revolution cream
contour kit in here and that's like my
favorite cream contour kit something
good okay well I do have that somewhere
she's not here right now I just go for
them roughly so there is an decay one
here this has like brushes bronzers
highlight in here packaged in this
ground these ones here are nipple so I
have this one I literally drop
everything that need to calm down
I'm not a native skin it shapes your
stuff Holly if you're looking for an
intense products that like contours your
face like snatched check this out
chilling down here is the Make Up For
Ever Pro sculpting panama pressure works
a cream one here is just a bunch of the
little one so maybelline here Rimmel and
echinacea flushed
Primark sleep revolution there's just
loads
there's my little iconic London contour
palette again this is a really nice
powder one as well and then I have this
Suzanne Jackson contour palette and also
Prime at one don't know why I still have
this because honestly this is not that
great but there we go if you can see if
I pull this out a little bit more I have
a sleek palette a no makeup revolution
one as well another way if I can close
at all this drawer is a little bit
different to others this basically has
two layers to it so I can take this off
and there is a bunch more stuff under
here which is super handy it just saves
the crap ton of space really which is
why these containers are so good so
basically destroys all of my loose
eyeshadows and glitters when I say leave
so just mean like single and ready to
mingle
here as you can see the benefit they're
real zero shadow blenders like a little
these are never probably try these so
it's kind of hard to give you guys my
actual opinion on these but I will try
them soon and I'll let you know in the
middle here sets all of the mix
prismatic eyeshadows that I own
oh my god the pigment isn't saying the
formation saying the color range is so
awesome they are really worth it a
couple of my personal faves has to be a
voodoo which is like this amazing
grown-up brown ground has greeny
brown color or so sunset days which is
this amazing copper color doll face
which is a super pretty like a vibrant
dark pink rose dust which is pretty much
a straight-up rose gold color and then
the last favors gilded which is a yellow
and yellow it's like my favorite color
so and then the last one on the right is
all of my NYX pigments again crap so my
colors green silver blues purples
oranges you name it probably there in
here is just a load of random single
eyeshadows so Diego dollar Palmer ones
those Nick's here
Nick's hook singles so this is Pamela's
I think color pop the very am dazzled us
here lift this tray off and out comes
all of this and allows there anything
that I like give me I love that this bit
this is just a little chunky loo squares
that you can put in your hair on your
face these ones here are so cool so
basically these are by brand called kiss
my fairy and when I was in I be fun this
is what they put on my shoulders and
stuff they sent me out some of their
chunky loose players as you can see
they're like hexagonal glitters there
are a lot more chunkier than say these
ones I have here which are just from
eBay these are a little bit finer as you
can receive it I like whether with the
kiss my favorite ones these ones you
actually get a six shell with it as well
which is super handy these two really
have a home to be honest which is why
they're in the middle but there's a lot
in London it's gem like alright really
good for festivals and stuff
you're just showing a little bit extra
one day I mean when you're underneath or
some of the MEA liquid moon dust the elf
liquid molten eyeshadows here Erlik a
heavy metal liquid liner and also the
collection at glamour crystals which I
think I need more color than these
because I think that's so fast and then
down here some of my favors diogenes
early nyx glitter pots and I mean the
colors of our video okay come and try
these yet with these are the peaches and
cream loose pigments so those typical
gypsy that one cooled we've got luck
starlight Phoenix some amazing colors
there then last but not least we have a
couple of and Make Up For Ever products
we have a starlet powder here and also
rate aqua excel kind of think that's a
lens back on and then at that etcetera
channel this drawer is where I keep all
of my mascaras and eyeliners I should
have primers everything like that how I
organized this draw is whole pencils
eyeshadow bases primers and gel liners
liquid liners and mascara as you can see
I have a bunch of cold pencils and it
would probably take me a lot of time to
go for all these we would be here till
2018 so here is some Urban Decay we have
some of the NYX of faux whites and also
the NYX for blacks makeup geek full

I'm sending this one off so the last
thing that's less ready to show you guys
is all of my makeup brushes as you can
see have quite a few I've got these
containers by the way from Ikea and also
the beads as well are from Ikea I'm
pretty sure these are actually like the
valve is where you put like plants and
stuff but my plants are my break up
brushes I just love the size in the
shape they hold my makeup brushes that
really well and then I just keep the
beads in there so the brushes actually
can stand in this one I like to keep my
Sigma brushes and then this I keep all
of my other brushes what I'm going to do
is I'm going to pick out some my
favorites and tell you guys what I like
to do with them this is the morphe m43 9
which is an amazing foundation brush as
you can see it's like rounded but like
super dense at bust in your foundation
another morphe brush this is the e4 this
is my favorite bronzer brush I love how
small and like compact is so I can
really pack on the bronzer because I'm
going to shower with that wonderful
Sigma powder sweet brush this is what I
use for my highlight is the perfect
little size to fit on my cheekbones and
just highlight my face this would be
Sigma flat definer as you can see it's
like a little rectangle and it's super
just for that this makes the perfect
brush for carving out of your eyebrows
these on Pierce on my favorite eye
brushes sorry asked you morphe 23 which
makes the perfect allover kind of crease
buffer brush as you can see it's like
the biggest one in it's like three
fluffy this one is the Sigma tapered
blending which I really likes to the
crease the Sigma for lending as you can
see it's like flat but kind of like
fluffy so I use this to kind of pack on
colors for like hello eyes or just any
time I want to pack on color and this
will go at the end this would be a Sigma
small tapered blending I love this for
underneath my eye it kind of places to
color and burns our all at the same
times I brush I love this one from NYX
this would be a zero eight brush I love
it because one at zero fiber so it
carries a product which means I'm not
going to get like BAM blush on your face
you know it blends really nicely and I
really like the shape it's like perfect
for my cheek
this is my makeup collection and storage
of 2017 I will make sure I'll link all
the storage and everything in the
description box below so check to that
owl so yeah that is everything I hope
