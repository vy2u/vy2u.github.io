hey girls and boy is this Jordan backing
it again with another youtube video my
makeup today is something a little bit
different for me a bit of blue okay I
kind of thought you know what I want to
do first impressions and then while I'm
doing the first impressions why don't I
play around with makeup a little bit do
something a little bit different so I
went for a fun a pop of blue with a nude
lip you know kind of have to focus all
on the color
I know blues a thing at the moment and
you might be bored of seeing it but guy
is this I should have palette that's all
I'm gonna say that's what I'm gonna say
this look that I'm wearing right now was
created using all at first impressions
there's just like a bunch of new makeup
that I've been sent or bought recently
that I want to try out so if you do want
to see how I you know painted my face a
day the products are you use wife
thought them then just keep watching
warning you're about to see naked face
Jordan in three two one degrees yet okay
I think we'll start with the face the
face base this primer is like a I don't
even know this is my Brown called make
I've never actually heard of this brown
like ever I think they've just launched
on fill unique this is their moonlight
moisturizing primer okay a primer a nice
primer that's it's actually black
honestly just looking at this it kind of
makes me feel some type of way this
primal apparently does all kinds of
things like high energy more high energy
protects your skin from HEV and ours and
all these raids well that is waiting
much science for me right now
basically this meant to be like a
moisturizing primer that's supposed to
protect your skin from all like the
damage that it gets from light from I'm
just gonna put it on my face
it's like a black gel me fell literally
feels kind of like an oil actually
mm-hmm what I smell like kind of smells
really subtly like sweets it's actually
quite thick but my skin feels so soft it
feels good I mean I'm not quite sure why
it's black maybe that's just its
differences stand out I mean no
judgement being made over here feels
nice it does feel nice I'm not like the
biggest primer lover sometimes I don't
know if they actually do anything but I
still put them on is anybody else like
that now on to 3000 spectrum actually
send me over a bunch of brushes to try
as well so I'm definitely gonna be using
some of these brushes to apply my makeup
today if I like I need to sneeze there
it is the foundation I'm gonna be
testing out today is the CYO
long-lasting foundation this lifeproof
that's a big claim lifeproof I mean this
better cover all my mistakes my life
choice is my path decisions see why I've
actually sent me over a bunch of stuff
to try and honestly I've not heard much
about this so I have no idea what to
expect what shade is this I have
absolutely no idea
that's pretty dark a do we write I do
like the peanut bar baby he doesn't feel
good
ah yeah do you know what it's actually
not that far off from my neck it's just
because I have barely any fake down on
my face I look a little bit crazy I'm
gonna take this spectrum a zero to brush
to begin with and I use my Beauty
Blender this brush is super soft okay I
definitely would say that's like medium
coverage I can still see like scarring
peeking through let's add some more me
feel like I'm painting my face this is
gonna sound so weird right but the
foundation is quite cooling when I put
it on those cooling am really
lightweight and it's got a really really
nice finish to it it's quite chewy
looking mMmmm I'm mad at this you know I
love the way it looks on the skin I just
wish there was more coverage you know
for like I've used a crap ton of product
already just to kind of get it how I
want it is one of those foundations that
you're like gone gone just a little bit
more coverage can't you got this I also
feel like it's a little bit too dark for
me so it kind of makes me look a tad bit
muddy but I'll work with it so far so
good I'm not mad at that
I'm not mad this is drugstore as well
I'm pretty sure that this foundation is
only like eight pounds or something so
look for concealer I have nothing new to
try out I know so I'm just going in with
my ax one invisi wear concealer woah it
looks well like on this foundation this
is like Kim K look now
Oh see I'm not gonna die skin looks
pretty good right now the concealer
sitting on that foundation really really
nicely which is always a good star here
is my skin a little bit more up close so
you can see what it looks like I'm
pretty damn impressed right now okay see
why oh okay Oh what did that go
okay so I've had many good things about
this powder this is the makeup
revolution lace luxury baking powder
I've genuinely heard people say this is
good as I laura mercier like that kind
of vibe so this was five pounds as well
tap some into the lid oh my god I just
realized this is literally this small
this little thing ever
how am I gonna get my sponge in there oh
nice I like the color it's like a really
neutral shade which is nice because then
I feel like it work full of skin tones
quickly before I crease like oh yeah
then I'm gonna take the spectrum c0
seven brush just to set the rest of my
face I can't tell if that's powder on
the brush or of that my trance what
trunk or if that's my foundation
transferring hmm
Stefanie a foundation that needs setting
cuz that feels sticky which is fine
because I always set my face because I
have really oily skin so you know what
for five pounds that powder is nice my
skin doesn't look dry or anything like
that which is fab it just looks really
smooth like a now I have all you skin
but I don't my skin to feel like the
freaking Sahara Desert or look like the
Sahara Desert
while my face you know is baking up in
here I have a bunch of the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzers here this is
the new packaging it's who face you've
upped your freakin game these are
gorgeous so heavy as well that they feel
really luxurious I don't know what color
to go for I think I thought my acrylic
was what the Frick frack why am I not
capable of simple tasks hey even though
these aren't actually new i've never
probably tried them so and now is my
chance this is a spectrum a zero-zero
brush
oh she pigment it and this brush is
thick she's thick oh I love that color
you know that like super warm bronzer
color that is so maybe for some people
this might be too warm but for me I love
it I love something this warm I think it
suits my skin zone
way better than something cooler I mean
it is quite red tone it's a bit more red
than I would usually go for probably but
at the same time I prefer this to
something more gray on bronze honey I
feel like this color would look gorge on
a darker complexion it's matte as well
which have a freaking lujah ha let me
just away this any some lip balm my lips
are hella right this stuff is in say
this is the YSL night rehab lip mask it
is so good my lips that you like so key
are and the best part it smells like
what I'm along for blush I have this
little guy here this is the allure II
our life's a peach blush in awakening
blush first of all the color is BU this
is the kind of blush shade I go for
something really peachy are you actually
use for real that smell is in sane just
peaches peaches peaches peaches you like
to flip it up and then there's a mirror
and actually comes with this little
brush as well but I mean a tongue no tea
no shade but that is like the face
version of them no eye shadow brushes
that you get in palettes like so I'm
going to use a spectrum 8:05 brush dip
it in
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes I
love that so much that is legit the most
perfect blush color I think I've ever
used just blends so nicely as well
L'Oreal you are out here doing bits
because that is literally perfect I
think I may have found my new favorite
blush and just because I really really
want to try it this out this is from
benneferre good old benefit in love yeah
this is the gold rush warm golden nectar
blush and this looks again amazing this
to me is like a glowy topper that's why
I kind of call it so it's got more
shimmer than color so it works perfectly
just to kind of like over the top for an
extra little summons summons well it in
what is everything smells so good like
can you see that Sheen obviously if you
have texture and stuff on your skin you
might want to stay away from something
like this because it might just
emphasize that but if you love a good
glowy cheek then it you're gonna love
this and it smells great
so far I'm not mad at anything and I
feel like I want to be mad at something
but I'm just not high light now what hey
this is from Primark this is the bronze
highlight loose highlighter and this is
the gold one this is two pound and from
what I can see this looks really nice
right let's tip a little bit that's
probably too much is there such thing as
too much eyeliner I'm gonna try this
spectrum be there are five brush for my
highlight I feel like it's a really good
size can I just say they're so far I am
loving these spectrum blushes they're
like applying everything really nicely I
have no problems and no shedding or
anything so so far so good donor me down
Primark tell me now
okay the tone of this highlight art is
really nice is that perfect golden shade
I'm not gonna lie though it starts off
really strong and the more you blend out
the more it kind of like disappears so
you put it on like that and you're like
oh right and then the more you blends
the more it kind of just slowly goes
away I mean it's still there don't get
me wrong it's kind of like it's not
sticking to the skin properly and I want
like BAM for my highlight I'm not like
what about if I try it where now I feel
like it's just not blending that was
about idea okay I don't really like that
oh yeah I need to use this right now
this is the new Mac prep and prime fix
post gold light so basically this is the
original fix pass but it has little like
pearl pigments in it to give your skin a
glow it kind of has the same vibe as the
iconic spray one which you guys know I
love but this is more golden some
expired oh the smell off Nick's class
gets me every time
oh the feeling when you spray fixed
classes a feeling that I want to feel
24/7 to be honest with you is fixed last
I've loved this stuff for years so I
thought I'm gonna love this I actually
had so many new palettes that I could
try out but honestly this one caught my
attention the most this is the amnok a
beached eyes shadow palette the colors
in this palette look in same the Blues
though they are calling my name
this to me is one of those palettes
which is like super wearable but you
have the pop of color and I'm all here
for that I'm actually gonna attempt to
play around with color the only
complaint I have about this palette is
there's one matte shade which is this
one here I'm gonna need a little bit
more than just one matte shade I'm gonna
use a spectrum these are a six brush and
take the matte shade here called
daybreak holy moly
as I expected so much pigment it's
blending out really really well too
there's no patchiness just gonna take a
little bit more and just build up the
crease just so it's a little bit darker
then you know up here I actually think
I'm Nick a eyeshadows have got so much
better over the years
they're naked 1 2 3 palette it was cute
but I was never like on the height like
I thought they were all right you know
and then as soon as they brought out the
ultimate basics palette I'm Nick a naked
he this are the backtalk palette that
eyeshadow formula has got so much better
so I mean I'm gonna Kaman Britain props
to you so far so good
that's for sure I feel like I need a
matte blue but you know what we're just
gonna work with what we've got gonna
take a spectrum 8:07 and I think I'm
just gonna mix double dip and plunge I
love their names just mix them together
to create you know a shade somewhere in
the middle oh that is pigmented look at
that oh my god that's dry as well I
didn't wet my brush didn't do anything I
just packed it on both in say now that
is how you do a blue eyeshadow the fact
that right now I don't even have a matte
blue to kind of blend the two eyeshadows
together yet they're still blending
together that means these are some good
eye shadows every time there's blue eye
shadow yes so good mins Haller
but honestly I'm vibing with this blue
right now this is a look just gonna
clean up the edge with a little bit of
concealer and then you know what just
for the shits and giggles I'm gonna take
the color sole and use that as my inner
corner highlight
and then also the brow bone and then I'm
just gonna run some of daybreak which
was the color we used first just
underneath now for some mascara I have
this to try out our Dell Precision
mascara so it's a top and bottom mascara
in one I think the concept of this is so
cool if you love you know mascara on
your top and bottom lashes
this could be great I mean I'm not
trying to yet but yeah so on this and
you have the top mascara which looks
like this which is like a normal-size
brush now she's in like a teardrop shape
though interesting and then the bottom
that is the smallest mascara wand I have
ever see it's like a bubble I mean I
don't wear bomb rush mascara but I can
see why that would be so good actually
this would be good at getting to like
the base of your lashes I am gonna be
wearing falsies so honestly I'm not you
know too crazy about the way that
they're gonna look but I think it's
really cool like that Ardell have no
brow and mascara obviously they're
famous for their lashes so it kinda does
make sense okay so so far I'm noticing
it's really really lengthening my lashes
but it's like a super natural looking
mascara
it doesn't deposit a crap ton of product
in your lashes so you know you have time
to kind of comb through you know I like
this for underneath lashes because I
don't like a mascara that puts a
crap-ton of mascara of course on my
lashes before forces because I feel like
it looks really thick and clumpy and
just like I like it would I wear on his
own without falsies probably not submit
to natural of me but when I worked for
for falsies
abso-freaking-lutely now for lashes so I
have some lashes here from XO beauty
which that just excites me XO beauty is
actually another youtubers brand its
Shannon Shannon XO Shannon Harris on
YouTube who by the way like I'm not
licking I say because they've sent me
some bits I genuinely mean this like she
seems so down-to-earth and her videos
are so good and just so like normal does
that make sense so yeah thank you so
much nothing in your team for sending me
across some bits I didn't even know she
knew who I was you guys I had no idea
that she even watched my videos and the
fact that she does
I'm getting really shy so yeah I have
some other faux mink lashes here which
look in sane how cute is the packaging's
list I'm actually looking at the lashes
now as you as they look I feel like I
want something a little less dramatic
for this just so the attention is a bit
more on the eyeshadow I've actually worn
the style Cupid before which is why
they're falling out and for lashes that
have so many lashes on are really really
full the lash band is invisible and
honestly the easiest faux mink eyelashes
I've ever applied like they just kind of
like fell on my eyes so I'm just gonna
apply these ones I think these are the
style Kylie from so suit stick down
please
who else is like me and is super
impatient with your eyelashes I just
want to get them on I'm really impatient
okay cool man stick down last thing now
lips so I have some more EXO usually
goodie used to try out so this is this
move on lip pencil this is in the color
Marnie I feel like this will go quite
nicely with the eyes a nice nude lip
this is literally basically on my lips
but better shade and then the actual
lipstick color I have the XO Beauty
matte lipstick and this is a initely
color DejaVu
mm-hmm I love this formula of matte
lipsticks where they genuinely are matte
but they still have that like creaminess
to them where they sort of glide on the
lip you know some matte lipstick she can
get any like and they just they just
don't even move on your lip I don't know
why I have a thing about smelling things
clearly I feel like that's all I've been
doing this video but they smell like
vanilla they smell really really good
even though this color is bu like it's
such a pretty nude I feel like I want
something a little bit more nude for
this eye makeup do you know what I mean
so I'm just gonna take some of my
concealer and just PI over the top just
to lighten air ever so slightly why is
this new color kind of everything of
fix+ again just to finish off the lip
I think I think there's everything to be
honest I have way more make I could try
but if I keep going with me he'll issue
forever so okay so this is the finished
look
this was another first impressions where
I got lucky like there was nothing this
video that I absolutely hated and I'm
like we'll never use again the one thing
that I'm kind of like about it's the
Primark highligher
I don't know I just feel like I wanted
more hold it some more you know I'd like
them and I go Scott but no you know what
apart from that everything else I'm so
impressed with this eyeshadow palette
holy these it is so bomb the Blues
are insane lips love the blush like the
L'Oreal blush oh my god I think that's
my new favorite blush the benefit for
that to girls hot was really nice as
well yeah
what the Frick it's good I feel like my
face doesn't look that bad see I hope
