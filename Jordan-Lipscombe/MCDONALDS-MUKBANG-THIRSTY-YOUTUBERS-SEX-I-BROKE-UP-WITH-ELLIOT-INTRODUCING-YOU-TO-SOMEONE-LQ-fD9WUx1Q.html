different but something I've wanted to
do for a while now I don't know about
you guys I thought that was a spider
then I basically shut my back but yeah I
don't know about you guys but I'm
obsessed with watching my bang there's
monk bongs and my home fries hey I don't
really know like the lingo over here but
I am obsessed with watching people like
ear and just like chat about anything
and everything for like an hour it's so
satisfying to me and it's just like so
chill to just be able to just stick on a
video and just like let it play and just
like listen and I don't know I don't
know you know the kind of videos we
don't read have to concentrate in is fab
that is what we're doing today we're
gonna be doing a a McDonald's Muk bang
because who doesn't honestly I wish I
had like a whole layout and I got like a
craps on her food I did only get enough
food to feed me because there's no one
here to eat it and I don't want to waste
food you know
trust me it's sad when he's he's
cheating oh you go to waste let's just
pretend that worked honestly you know
what what drink is mine every single
time because the lipstick troubles
Wow
that's thirsty so I just got a coke
Booker's right right let me just like
give you the tea McDonald's again I
don't know whether much don't also have
just like not got their stuff saw it or
like what's going on
every single time okay we go to this
motor neurons which is like the closest
one to us every single time and when I
say every single time I mean every
single time the frappe machine in the
milkshake machine is legit broken like
how can that be a thing they're like yes
or it's not working today we don't have
any milk shakes off from babies and I'm
like I don't think it's broken
honestly I think it's a conspiracy
theory if you look it up like Google
like conspiracy first McDonald's and you
should be able to find it i low-key
believe it like I actually think it's
live Joe food-wise
I got no chicken nuggets of course some
chippies why do I was like never fill
their chips up like hello I got a
cheeseburger and I also got some of
their like cheese bite things because
he's a circus it's also they give me
ketchup I'm gonna catch up and go I'm
more like a sweet-and-sour go that's
trip of the day but I mean it so
basically I asked you guys what you kind
of wanted me to talk about what you
wanted me to cover in this video and a
lot of you just sort of said it's kind
of bit like girl talk I love you wanted
girl talk go talk what I mean by that is
talk about self love confidence
relationships also YouTube was quite
popular as well you also wanted to be a
boss I know but it's he so I'm sure
spill a little bit today so you know get
ready and something you wanted to know
like a little bit about me as like an
actual human being we're just kind of
crazy to me cuz I am like she just jords
but yeah I don't really know what I'm
gonna cover today I'm just gonna say I'm
just gonna chat and just see what it
literally comes out of my mouth when I
see your two spots are so good huh I
feel really rude like talking and even
at the same time just like don't mind me
so a lot of you were asking me if I've
got anything going on behind the scenes
I've kind of mentioned something before
and in histogram live something that's
where it's come from and the answer to
that is yes right
trust me okay it has been so hard not to
tell you anything and I still can
however all that I'm gonna say is it's
super super exciting and you should know
towards the end of the year swimming
like a few months that is all I can say
otherwise like my management we can't
wait I've been working on it for a while
oh and you know you'll find out soon
enough anyway like I saw you on to next
so yeah that's definitely like one thing
that's happening my I'm trying to get
involved with something else but it's a
bit of a harder like industry not
industry because it sounds like it's
something that I don't do I do do it do
do I don't know we're just like working
on it and seeing what we can do when you
want something so bad you want to work
for it but I believe in like fate a lot
and you know if something happens it
happens if it doesn't right now it's you
know it's not meant to be and when it
wants to happen it will happen and it
would be the right time and it'll be
great you guys are probably like what
the Frick Jordan like you probably have
no idea what I'm talking about but
basically at job-wise I'm trying to get
involved and do as much as I can and
just kind of work hard to make my dreams
happen cuz I'm lucky enough to be you
know have a job that I absolutely love
which is amazing yeah there's definitely
one big thing happening towards the end
of the year and everything else will
just kind of like fall into place I hope
I wasn't wind but yeah sponsorships and
we just like talked about sponsorships
from really like really real quick
I might not boy how did you know
youtubers do sponsorships like that's
the thing you know at the end of the day
when it's our job that is how we earn
money and there's a difference between
doing something with a brand fuel of and
doing it because you're passionate about
it and earning money like that and doing
something because you're gonna get a few
grand in a bank account there is a big
difference and I feel like a lot of
people see sponsorships as a bad thing
especially when you know you're not in
that industry a girl we got a hustled
you know I mean but there's like
hustling and then like taking the piss
you know I get why some people might
think oh my god reduce friendships all
the time like it's not a good thing but
like let me use me as an example
you guys are 100% gonna be seen more
sponsored videos for me like I'm gonna
keep it real with you guys
I've got like four or five more coming
up in the next month
100% which is a lot and I never normally
take that much and I've tried so hard
with my management to like really split
it up but of course brands want certain
things up at certain times and they
won't budge
so unfortunately there will be moments
where I might have to sponsored videos
up in a row or there might just be like
a collection of them in one little short
space of time however what you guys
don't see is I turn down all of our
stuff think about how many brands there
are in the world
mochi thoughts like I think about that
you know like the amount of brands that
we want to work with people it's crazy
so doing four or five really isn't as
bad as you think
I've only accepted them because I
thought brands and I'm sure every single
one I'm doing you have 100% heard of and
I don't want to turn down a relationship
with a brand
just because I'm worried about what
people are gonna say about me doing a
sponsored video like it is all legit I
overhear not on this channel it is legit
we don't do stuff for the sake of it
listen my trust with you guys and my
reputation in that respect is way more
important than getting a few pounds of
my bank account cuz girl I'm not a
sellout
I will never will be I would do brands I
love and make my money that way and
enjoy what I do
then sit here and pretend that I love
something you should go buy it when
really it's like sharing I don't on the
button anyway no it's like a bit over
wrong but all I'm saying is you're gonna
be seeing a few from me I'm just doing
what I love working with the brand's I
love and doing things that will benefit
you guys as well you know promoting
stuff that I love and I know that you
guys are gonna love so yeah that was a
whole nother right that just happened um
I also forgot to mention that any time I
do sponsored videos as well I always ask
the brand to get something for you guys
i buy those discount code money off or
something just because you know girl you
work hard for your coins
you shouldn't have to spend shit that
I'm gonna you know but yeah just we need
to to mention that let me get like a
chicken nugget oh you know I like
mmm talking about sponsorship don't see
if you wanna check out up then I'm I'm
not going mad you know joking joking
dinging jkj knowed it oh my god Aramark
speaking of ASMR actually I really
really want to do a ASMR like responding
to hate comments video I think that's so
funny I'll watch like Geoffrey Stars and
Jackie Ines and I think I like the best
thing ever and I really want to do one
now and just bring his jokes if I don't
even get some are you down and I feel
like just doing a responding to a
comment video I don't know it just makes
it 10 times funnier cuz obviously like
hate and stuff like there's the thing
but you know what like you have to just
like not take it seriously because it's
just like babes like you don't actually
know me I don't know I'm just trying to
include more fun stuff on my channel you
know stuff that I genuinely watch
outside of me being this side of the
camera you know drink just coke why do I
feel like I'm getting full already and
I've just had some cheese by someone
chicken oh good okay right what do you
guys think of the like do YouTube scene
these days compared to how it used to be
especially if you're like a vivid what
your vivid just mother what I mean it
I'm a mess vivid children David thank
you man avid well basically if you watch
YouTube for a long time what do you
think about it now well I'm not sure I
feel about anymore I just feel like
YouTube full of people has become a
competition and they're like kind of
grosses me out
and it's kinda cringe there are some
youtuber
which they see YouTube as you can earn
the most views who can do the biggest
clickbait I don't know and it's just
kind of sad because we all do the same
thing here and people get so hung up on
views and how much money the end and I
get it being your job you have to think
about these things and I'm not seeing
you and saying that I don't sit here and
look at views on a video and if one
doesn't do so well you know I'm not a
little bit gutted I'm not saying that
that's so normal
I know people who like have got like not
so good views in a video I want to
delete the video and I'm like babes you
spend so much time on that like I had
several conversations with people and
they've said about doing now I don't
know I guess people just view things
differently and also drama like what the
hell now listen I'm a sucker for a
little bit of tea a little bit of juice
a little bit Goss so I'm not hanging on
this in any way shape or form
I feel like it's become a bit of like
what's the word like bit catty look a
bit like school girly and it's just a
bit like oh I'm actually here to judge
in my opinion really makes no difference
whatsoever but I'm just like trying to
you guys like you're my friends no
YouTube's a funny pose oh my god I drink
so much my coke is like already here by
the way I'm not aiming at anyone in
particular I'm just saying in general
the fun part of YouTube is slowly
getting taken away and people are seeing
it as like competitors like youtubers
are competitors but it's like we all do
the same thing here
so why are we trying to compete to each
other we all sit down in front of a
camera and record an edit and upload it
you know I'm happy to just Aaron eat my
chicken nuggets cuz this is called as he
comes if okay I kind of want to get off
talking about YouTube cuz they're like
low-key balls me a little bit because
it's marine I think you've not heard
before I feel like this is about to get
serious and I'm gonna turn into serious
jorts for a bit which I can't do if you
didn't know that I can't be a little bit
more serious is it so a huge topic that
I had from you beautiful people I was
about self love and confidence
how have I learnt to love
self and have the confidence you know
because I do a job that requires me to
like put myself out there and not give a
crap about all people think about me I
guess a lot of you think that I have
gone past that step and I've gained that
like confidence in self-love but I mean
like self-love and confidence is not an
easy thing especially living in the
society that we live in these days it's
so intimidating and this literally okay
I'll lose brain cells thinking about
this okay I'm Society for some reason is
person am on what perfect is because
perfect is a thing we'll talk about who
has chosen what that looks like who has
hurt that stamp on that look and been
like that's you know that's goals like
that's how we should all look like oh
hell to the no Matt and like think about
it right if we all looked like that how
would we stand out what would make us
different from anybody else and how
boring would that be I'm not down for
that I think I've kind of just got to a
point in my life where I've accepted
that there's only one of me this is how
I look I'll embrace it and I love that
because I'm gonna be with this for the
rest of my life and to be happier that's
just what you got to do you got to get
these images out of your head of what is
perfect and just put your own stamp on
it how cool is it when you think about
it you're the only one of you that's
unique and that's so cool I know people
say this and it's so cliche to say my
life is way too short to care about what
other people think if you want to do
something do it self love and confidence
kind of come hand in hand but just do
you there is nothing more exciting and
more interesting than you being you I'll
be scrolling through Instagram for
example and I'll see like oh my god all
these girls blah blah blah blah blah and
I'll be like oh my god like why don't I
look like that with my midmark Don was
in the middle like I'm sitting here
saying all this and I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys I don't
always feel confident and like I have
that self excuse me
have that self-love because I am a 20
year old girl
and I have insecurities and things I
don't like about myself just like any
other boy and girl you know just because
do YouTube doesn't make me nor real
human being with feelings and I'm
exactly the same I have days where I
wake up and I'm like oh no I hate this
about me I hate this about me I hate
this got me in other days I'm like okay
gold I can kind of fit it myself today
I'm not so fine that is so normal but
all that I'm saying is learn to love
yourself a little bit more and just be
confident in your own skin it is a
beautiful thing that you look like you
and nobody else looks like you you know
it's right you'll stuff girls and boys
strut your stuff there is no way you're
gonna please everyone in this world and
I'm cool with that man like oh then you
walk down your lane and I'll walk down
mine don't let someone's opinion of you
affect the way you portray yourself will
feel about yourself just live your life
for you don't care about what people say
or think about you because you're gonna
be so much happier and happiness is way
better looking than someone who wants to
comment on everything you do because
that's ugly if we're like a therapist
therapist dudes Wow a lot of you asked
me about sex as in my first time when I
think it's right to do it
etc etc that did surprise me though
because I know a lot of you are older
and kind of more more my age and I'm so
open and easy to talk about this stuff I
mean mom and dad if you are watching
yeah you might just want to like skip
forward a couple minutes or something
but as you asked me when the right time
is to lose your virginity
I'm like for real you'll just know I
didn't lose my virginity until I was 17
and that's quite late look I love my
friends that or you don't know but me I
am someone who has to feel so
comfortable it's kind of like a scary
thing especially going into it when you
don't you don't know what it's gonna be
like is it gonna hurt is it not like
you're worried about like well you look
like you're worried about hottie other
person's gonna feel I don't know I just
wanted to do it where I felt so so so
comfortable so why he did it when I was
17 and in a relationship it was my last
relationship before me and I was now and
I felt completely comfortable with him
and it made the experience wait easier
that's for sure there's no like right
age or right time if you feel that it's
right and you feel comfortable I just
wasn't gonna let anybody make me feel
like
I should have lost already it was like
nope I'm waiting make me wrong I knew I
wasn't gonna be out the movies I was
like I'm waiting for the right person
because I need like if this hurts I need
to be able to UM one who could be like
um exit which speaking about pain oh now
I'm not to put any of you off ago not
spurt a new view of mine hurt like a
bitch
I felt like my vagina splitting in two
is that much it's not too much to say me
incident not to get like really deep
because some of you might not like me
like a Jordan like we get that your
Chronicle talking about it that is way
too far huh we tried and it I couldn't
do it it hurts so much
and I was like okay right let's stop
today is not the day we're trying and
soon but like no no and then a week
later we did it and it hurt less but it
still hurt me um and honestly the first
a good few months it still hurt like
there was no I was like why I thought I
was abnormal I was so I'm that small or
is he that big it was like the weirdest
thing and I was like I'm abnormal there
was something wrong with me it surely
should be hurting by now like I don't I
don't get it obviously now it's so fine
literally doesn't hurt at all but then
it's weird because obviously I speak to
my friends about it and they tell me I
have a lot of friends I like and one
didn't have on there it just depends on
the person which is why I am saying to
you guys my only thing my only little
like mumsy advice be comfortable like so
if it does hurt your come from one have
to be like okay let's stop oh no here
cuz you've got to be kidding me
they ask you how you are you just have
to say that you're fine when you're not
I was out last night and I'd hear cups
like the whole night it was like it's
annoying they get well I actually meet
some of your notes out and it's so funny
like my apologies if I'm like a drunken
Thomas we just out here having a good
heart why was that shit really hard
honestly that airplane may as well have
been in my room with me speaking of you
know that kind of thing a relationship
update life update like that everything
is good me no really good yeah I love
you asking about our living situation do
we live together if not where we
planning to move out etc Ike's
as of right now we don't live together I
live at home with my mum my dad and my
sister
so we originally were actually gonna go
and rent somewhere so within the next
few months we're gonna go rent and I'm
lucky enough to be in a position where I
can actually get a mortgage and I feel
like many ways it just makes sense for
me to get a mortgage then waste my money
on renting so we've decided to kind of
like delay the whole thing and get a
mortgage next year so that's really
exciting
we're not like in a rush or anything I
think these things you know you need to
be like sure and make sure it's the
right time because it is a huge
investment I mean I'm happy where I am
he's happy where he is obviously in an
ideal world we would love to live
together so that it just makes easier to
see each other has a little bit more
freedom
I'll have this space that I need space
is the biggest thing for me like right
now you guys see this background if you
see around me it's just hot freaking
mess
but not only that I just have no room to
literally put anything we're all Gucci
speaking of relationships one of the
biggest things that you guys asked me
about was heartbreak now I mean I am no
freaking expert like I that's what I've
never been heartbroken this is severally
I've only ever been in one of a proper
relationship before idea and that was
like a little bit of a crazy
relationship I've never really spoken
about my past relationship it was so
unhealthy and it's the woman I just
couldn't do anymore who so emotionally
involved that it just got to up with
anything I did it like it was making him
ah is so hard to talk about because I
can't speak for him he's not a generally
mean but from my point of view in a
relationship it it just wasn't gonna
work it was the wrong place the wrong
time
I mean it's so fine now though like
there's no AG or like awkwardness
between us at or which is so is so nice
to have no matter who broke up the
relationship is just so nice to have
that like selled point dug me wrong when
we first broke up there was no way that
was gonna happen what I'm trying to say
is is that I've never really had to deal
with heartbreak in the sense of being
broken up with I kind of did it but I
didn't want to do it if you know what I
mean so I kind of have dealt with that
side of it was kind of heartbreaking
away it was like heartbreak that you
didn't want me how to do it for each
other's happiness which is the way to
but actually you know I'm gonna say guys
if I wasn't gonna tell you guys but I
will because we're like family
yeah me and Elliott actually splice
gonna sound so dumb okay it was for less
than 24 hours but it happened it was one
of the hardest things to deal with
obviously I'm not gonna go into the
deets and what happened and the best way
to do were there I would say it
genuinely like speak to someone or if
you don't actually want to speak to
someone who it's gonna sound crazy you
know like Jordan you've lost your
goddamn mind go you've lost your might
have to speak your feelings out loud and
if you need to cry cry even if it's not
to anyone just literally let it out into
the world because pollyana up is the
worst feeling ever and that's when it
builds up and gets worse and worse and
well as far as if you just let out and
also this is like a really really
obvious one but surround yourself with
people that make you the happiest
because they will support you in a way
that no one else will
what I mean by that is they support you
in a way that you won't necessarily sit
there and speak about the situation
because that just brings it all back up
again and then it flows out again and
then it's just like going back to the
beginning but it will be in a way that's
like I know what's happened and I'm here
for you but I'm gonna make you feel
better and happier and that is the best
way to recover this was really indirect
he's like you know they
but they're not like being really direct
and being like okay you okay it's just
like look I'm here for you let's go out
let's let's do something to take your
mind off of this and they're the kind of
people that you need in your life you
know close friends family that kind of
thing
oh that is a smooth don't atop of a
cheeseburger just look really satisfying
Wow real question is who eats the
Gherkin inside cheeseburger I literally
love good cuz I could eat them wrong hmm
wanna see that's just why I get
cheeseburger like after cheeseburger to
get the Gurkha I'm joking about do like
gogans why would say is always put your
mindset in a good place even if the
break-up was not what you wanted I'm not
quite sure why I'm crapping this is
probably gonna sound so cliche okay but
it is so goddamn true there is plenty
more fish in the sea and it's definitely
not gonna feel like that at the time I'm
gonna be like right that's it I'm not
gonna find it
I remember if he or she dumped your ass
and you just have better than that and
you will get better than that and it's
simple that without such know the symbol
is it relationships are freakin
complicated man rather enjoy my
cheeseburger you know
honestly I'm that bitch you will like
take a bite of something just one bite
and need a drink I'm like Mike drink my
drink you know some people who like can
eat a whole meal not have a drink like
what kind of sauce every is an Eastern
moist in the esophagus oh my god guys I
have someone I need to show you again
hey girl
oh she can smell the food girl is she
just not the cutest little thing you've
ever seen this is our new little Donnie
oh she's called siren and she's a
greyhound we got her from a retired
racing greyhound place she's 5 as well
by the way and she's so well-behaved she
loves cuddles like she will eject just
sit here look how cute she is where that
