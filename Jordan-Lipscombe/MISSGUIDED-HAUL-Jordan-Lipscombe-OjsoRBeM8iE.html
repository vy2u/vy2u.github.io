a misguided haul now if you didn't know
misguided is literally one of my
favorite places and did you like clothes
shopping so yeah
I'm like so chilled in this video like a
cup of tea got my hoodie on love it and
my things going so can we just
appreciate the size of the bag right and
it's so pretty I love it really quickly
before I start this video I'm totally
open and honest about if I get sent
things so misguided did kindly get in
contact with me and ask if I want to
pick a few things out from their website
but didn't tell me to make a video and
this is not sponsored in any way and so
this is totally off my own bag the only
reasons why I want to make this video is
because one I love misguided and
everything I got I actually love so I
just want to share it with you guys and
- well I mean I just want to okay I lied
there is one more thing I just want to
really quickly mention and so just as a
bit of a sizing guide to kind of help
you guys out a little bit because I know
online shopping can be a pain in the
butt sometimes because you just don't
know what size to get you don't know if
it'll fit properly so just to give you
guys my sizing so you can see how these
pieces fit I'm typically a size 8 on top
and on bottom and I'm about 5 foot 5 5
foot 6 in height I did get a mixture of
size 8 and size sixes obviously I'll
tell you what I got as I go along
but yeah yeah oh and this will be a
Tryon hole because what I like trying
holes I like seeing what things look
like on so then you one more sit before
we carry on this is a good cup of tea
while on George okay so the first thing
I have to show you guys is a jumper
dress and as you can see it's in this
car key color I've been obsessed with
car key you'll be able to tell in this
hole I love this so it is this like
green jumper dress it just goes down
like so though of course it has long
sleeves and and what I loved about it
I'm really into this trend of like
having like the rips in your clothes
like some people think moths have been
at my stuff but I'm a like so there's
just like some holes and rips up the top
here and there's
also a couple by the leg here but no I
love this I love the way it fits it is
naturally oversized quite loose in like
baggy but I mean I like that I love
comfortable clothing and also what I
really like about it is a jump a dress
but it's not like really thick or
anything because when I'm inside knowing
like really thick clothing I'm like
melting this winter I just know I'm
going to be a living in like jumper
dresses t-shirt dresses with like coats
and knee-high boots just I've got
visions yeah like I said it is naturally
oversized so I did pick this out in a
size 6 and it fits perfectly and and for
pricing in case you are interested in
purchasing anything and this is on the
website 22 pounds so still so the next
thing I have to show you this jump out
from a misguided and it of course it is
joy nice one it's just this like nude
pink colored jumper so it has like the
lace-up bit at the front there as you
can see but what I it like really really
liked about it when I saw on the website
was the sleeves like it looks like the
sleeve has come away but it's been like
stitch back up if you know what I mean I
love the fact that it's cropped as well
because crop jumpers are kind of my
style I guess like I love wearing them
with high waisted things whether that's
jeans leggings anything like that it's
just so comfortable as well I think I'm
going to be able to star this up with so
many things and I love this color like
this nude pink color so for sizing I did
ask for this in a size 8 but I've just
read on the label it says p'tee extreme
lace-up swear so this must be half the
petite range however honestly this fits
me fine so I don't know if that makes a
difference and it is also only 18 pounds
to this dress though I just not only
does it just fit so well it just looks
so feminine and classy and I'm just all
about that huh it just looks like a long
piece of material but basically it's a
bandeau midi dress well it's like a long
midi dress so it literally just goes on
and on and on so like I said it is long
it does come below the knees but I love
that because I just think it's so like
sophisticated and then it is Bandos
you're showing off like your show
and stuff which i think is just like so
girly and I just love the way that this
fits the material is like that stretchy
material which just clings to your body
like it just hugs you and it feels so so
comfortable this with maybe some nude
strappy heels on a night out would look
hot or even like on a casual day you
could wear this throwing like a big long
coat I have want to show you in this
hall spoiler I did pick this up in a
size 8 because it was body con so I knew
it was going to be kind of tight so and
but I could have got a size 6 I think
where it's stretchy I totally could have
fit in one but just so you know there is
kind of leeway I guess on the website
this is 25 pound I really literally paid
this for this dress any day long I'm
actually off this video gonna go and
misguided and see if they have this in
any other colors because I love it that
much like I want to get all of them so I
love body suits I just think they're so
versatile like on a night out with a
skirt or they stay with some jeans like
however you want to wear it I just love
them so I picked up this black off the
shoulder one here and of course it's off
the shoulder I love anything off the
shoulder by the way it's just my thing
so it's of course a bodysuit so there's
the bit that goes around your knee and
then what I love about it is it comes
with like a choker bit attached so
obviously it just like sits off the
shoulder like this and then you've got
like the choker bit here which to you
you'll sit better on the Tryon when I
sort on the website I was like yep I
need that I just think it's so edgy
where it's like black and it has the
kind of thick lace-up choker to it as
well I think it would just make any
outfit like bit event you know J
anything about body suits are a pain
like when you need to go for a way it's
just down the back up like how much more
pain is that like do we relate do we
relate I think so I did get this in a
size 8 because otherwise it just
wouldn't be long enough to you know flip
her and it is 22 pounds of misguided you
just can't go wrong with a bit of black
clothing you've just gone I have another
little casual dress to show you guys so
it is just the wrong way around
apparently it is just this all white
t-shirt dress oh so it's just all plain
until you see the sleeves and you're
like okay so each leave just has this
like cross stitching on your seotc you
a couple of pieces of clothing there is
this pattern on because I don't know it
just adds so much detail right although
it is a t-shirt dress it does have like
a jumper thickness to it so the material
is really nice for the winter and it
comes to a really nice length as well
similar to that green one and again it
is slightly oversized too which is nice
you know I also loved the fact that this
is why it because it just makes me look
ready to end I got this in a sore as a
foot and a size 6 too because obviously
the whole like oversized thing and it is
20 pounds this skirt I have to show you
next is so nice like the MS here it was
just such good quality you would think
that it was going for more misguided and
what actually is so this is really
really pretty gray suede a line skirt
like just look at it so it just has that
cross stitching again on each leg and
then it comes to like a bit of an
opening here to show a bit of skin and
the little lace-up bits here this fits
so well if you're like me and you
struggled to find it's like skirts that
fit really nicely around your waist
because it's quite small when then sort
of go over your bum as well check this
out because it fit really nice and like
I said the material is like top quality
it's like so luxurious and you would
definitely think that it was a lot more
expensive so it does have a little zip
obviously to get in and out of it one
thing I will say though is just be
careful with this where it's like a
thick material the zip sometimes as you
can see struggles you should have seen
me like I put it on and then I couldn't
get off and me my mom we're trying to
get a skirt off for about 10-15 minutes
and I was like right I'm living in it so
I got mine in an 8 because obviously I
don't want it to be too small and and on
the website it is 25 pounds to share
with you guys and it is this nude pink
t-shirt dress because like I don't have
enough already I feel like it's coming
up really peachy on camera but it's more
of a like a nude in real life I think
this one to be honest a ball of them
fits me the nicest just because it comes
up a little bit more fitted I dig it in
the same size as the others obviously
where it's a different material it
obviously comes up differently the
material is really nice as well it's not
like Jersey t-shirt material or anything
just feel really good quality like a
stretchy material and it's ripped if you
look really closely it's got like tiny
little ripped details all along it or
completely forgot to say and it does
come up shorter than the other ones but
like I mean my fish isn't hanging out or
anything but I just wanted to mention
that in case you have taller than me or
anything like that like I said I got in
the same size as the other ones which is
a sick for pricing as well annoyingly
I've been looking for this on misguided
for the last like 20 minutes and I can't
seem to find it so I'll keep looking and
I'll leave it in the description box
below if I find it but it wasn't
expensive I think it was about like 1820
pounds something like that couple things
I have to show you are kind of casual
and then I also have a coat so cocky
again like I'm sorry
now let's go in extraordinary like I say
this is a jumpsuit so it's going to be
kind of hard to show you but basically
I've just realized look how big that
neckline looks like I promise my neck is
not that big basically this is an
off-the-shoulder jumpsuit which is where
I looks like this because obviously it
will just naturally sit off the shoulder
like that goes down into like this waist
bit here well obviously you can just
like tighten the waist with those
strings and then obviously it goes down
to the leg portions and in each knee you
have these little slits like how cute is
huh I wasn't sure about the fit of this
but actually fits really nicely like the
legs aren't too long the crotch isn't
too low and it's not like too oversized
and big obviously it's got some rim in
it and but I obviously like that for
being comfortable because I got this to
just chill around the house in but when
I put it on I was like you know what I
could actually like pair this with some
like alright trainers maybe so I'm like
a leather jacket and just like pop to
the shops or something like you could
wear this out and it'd be acceptable
it's just so comfortable it's like a
tracksuit onesie it's so comfortable
it also did come in a bunch of different
colors as well and I chose this in a
size 6 so I would definitely size down
from your normal size with this
otherwise it would be like really really
big and it was I think it's 22 pounds on
the website so really good for like
something that I'm gonna get a lot of
wear out so I love the like cross
stitching design so much that
got it in some Trekkies as well these
great Rockies are party Sara Ashcroft
collection and I love her so I mean you
know I'm going to get them so they're
just these grey Trekkies that go down
into like little cuffed bottoms here now
they aren't like super slim Trekkies but
they're not like baggy either they're
like that in-between they're just so
different I think because of this design
they can just make any casual outfit
look kind of like glam like you put a
little F into it if you know what I mean
and they're nice and thick so they'll
keep you warm and they do have the
drawstrings on here as well so you
shouldn't get a build as bad I live in
trackies so I mean I'm literally wearing
some right now oh my god I pick this up
in a size 8 and these are 18 pounds so
the last thing I've to show you is a
coat now this isn't really Jordan but
honestly I just saw it on the model and
I was like she looks good in it I'm
gonna give it a go this by the way it's
like super classy like I feel like a
woman in it so it's this nude colored
waterfall CO and it literally is just so
long it goes I think like down by my
calves it's just such a long coat and
but I love the fact that it's waterfall
so you get that like design around you
so it kind of like frames you if that
makes sense
it's just super feminine I pictured this
with that like bando oekaki green like
midi dress I think that would look so
nice
then I wanna think about this kite and
when I got it I was a bit like mmm about
I think I was just expecting a different
material but it's basically like that
felt material so I don't have the
material but apart from that I feel
really growing up when I wear it like I
feel like a bow lady
I actually picked this up in a size 6
and it definitely was the right decision
because an 8 would have been too big so
again I sized down with this and this
was the most expensive piece in this
whole this was 35 pounds I think but for
a good coat so that was everything I
have to show you guys in this video and
like I said I will link everything down
