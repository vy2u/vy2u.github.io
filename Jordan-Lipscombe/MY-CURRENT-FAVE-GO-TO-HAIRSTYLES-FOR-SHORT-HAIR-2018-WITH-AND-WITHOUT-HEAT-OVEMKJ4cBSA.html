back at it again with another YouTube
video I'm seeing a video that I've
actually not done in so long like a year
maybe no blimey that is a hot minute let
me tell you so I thought you know what
let's just do another one let's bring it
back you guys have been asking me to do
this for the longest time finally I'm
doing it you can probably tell from the
title anyway it but today I'm gonna be
doing my current favorite go-to
hairstyles and there was a mixture of
stuff in here we've got the sleek and
straight kind of vibe
we've got buns updos and we've also got
waves there is literally something for
everyone in this video within the past
month I've gone back to my like shorter
hair which I have missed my short hair
okay like it's always been kind of short
but like it's short now like up here
literally my favorite thing ever huh and
then I recently got it color so I
thought hey why don't we just like walk
out with a video like right about our
disclaimer as well before anybody
literally like comes for me I know that
my hair is not the shortest hair in the
world but it is short like when I go to
put my hair up all the underneath layer
falls out like that's when you know
you've got your hair right here anyway
anyway anyway I think that's everything
with all that being said I really really
hope this is helpful for you and you
enjoy these looks as much as I do so if
you want to see how I created this and
many other hairstyles then yeah just
keep watching starting off with you
sleek and straight look I'm gonna show
you guys know how I get my hair pretty
damn straight but also how I get it like
smooth and sleek all at the same time so
starting off with my freshly washed hair
I'm going to part my hair just above my
eyebrows just put into two sections you
know so it's bit easier to deal with
it's not too much of a whole mess now
I'm taking my way at smooth spray now
this little guy let me tell you let me
tell you this is like the key to the
smoothness so I'm just gonna spray that
on that section brush your fruit to get
the product everywhere now using my
ghd's which are the best hair
straighteners ever I'm going to start
from the root go down the hair but the
key is to go down slowly I know it seems
like it'd be more time consuming by
actually like it takes less time because
you just go down the hair one
and your hair's like immediately
straight you don't have to keep going
over it and it's better for your hair as
well you don't have to use as much heat
like keep repeating the same thing if
you know what I mean just you can see
here is like a little before and after
so we go from like a wavy frizzy hot
mess to Desiree in literally seconds so
I'm just gonna repeat that over the bond
layer once I'm happy with that I'm gonna
take down the top layer split my hairs
on the middle spray some more of that
way smooth spray in and then just carry
on straightening my hair
it literally is dead simple once I've a
straightened everything BAM power of
editing I wish I could show my head is
quick but what can you do we are going
to sort out the little flower so can you
guys see the little bits of hair that
are sticking up that little bug hair
bits they have all they do to tame them
take the way smooth spray in my hands
and then just use my hands to flatten
over the little crazy pieces of hair and
as you can see it ends up super super
smooth and guys that is literally it
that is this first hair so sleek and
straight again but tight behind the ears
less viewers pretty much the same as
last time but is so simple to do and it
looks like a brand new house outright so
rewind back to the technique I used to
show my hair I'm gonna do that come back
to this hairstyle and I'm gonna take the
two front pieces of hair and just tuck
them behind my ears for a sec now I'm
gonna have some volumes I'm gonna take
my little teasing brush take a section
of hair from my crown and just also like
it gently tease the hair I personally
like the way this looks I think from all
angles it looks pretty good now I'm
going to my favorite has very little
Oreo L net guys this is the best goddamn
hairspray AHA I'm just going to spray
the t's to keep that in place all day
smooth over with my hands then give my
hair one final all you know one two
little spritz of hairspray now I'm gonna
take a bobby pin and this is a really
good tip if your hair struggles to stay
behind your ears just pin the bits of
hair back like this this is good if
you've got like short bangs as well and
it will stay there the whole time and
that is it
next hairstyle the lobe on guys this is
so simple I love it cuz it's so
effortless and carefree and you can just
like and do it and walk out the door you
know what I mean so sighing bye govern
the hair at the nape of my neck making
sure I get all of the hair taking a
hairball and I'm gonna start timer hair
like I would a normal Pony but on the
last time round just pull it halfway
through to create that loop now short
hair troubles I get these little sticky
out bits so I just have to kind of
gather the hair back again and put
another hair band round just to extra
secure it to make sure you don't get
them weird like spikey sticky outfits
also ignore that weird bit of hair
sticking out it's so hard I could
actually see because I don't have a
mirror but I'm yeah I'm on it I like
more of like a care for you kind of vibe
so I'm just gonna pull out the roots to
kind of loosen everything up a little
bit now taking a bobby pin I'm gonna
start to pin my fringe bit back here
just to ensure that it doesn't like fall
down or anything
fringe bangs what everyone called amide
on both sides get my hair final spritz
of hairspray and that is that one done
now for the high bun I'm pretty sure
this is what inspired this video to be
fair for like you guys really really
wanted to see this no it's actually dead
simple so I start by just covering my
hair onto the top of my head I also use
my brush just to kind of like get all
the hair and smooth everything out now
I'm going to take a hair bubble I prefer
the slightly thicker ones either right
they actually hold my hair properly and
I'm gonna start tie my hair like I would
a normal Pony the same sort or by but on
the last time round like I'm doing now
I'm just gonna put it through a third of
the way through just to create a little
baby loop and hopefully you'll have
something like this I will zoom in to
show you so yeah tie it once twice
normal but the third time around or
whatever last time your heaven is if
that makes sense
just pull it a third of the way through
now just in the middle of the bun I'm
gonna start sort of ruffling it up and
putting out a little bit just to create
a bit more texture and now these two
side cuts here I'm gonna pinch them pull
them back and tuck them into the back of
the hair band just to create a bit of a
thinner bun and then obviously because
we didn't pull the hair free we have
these bits left so I'm just divide it
into two and cross them over the front
of the bun like this and then pull them
back round to the back and then just pin
it in place with some bobby pins as you
can see the bun shape is already there
and it's dead simple that's it I go
ahead just keep bobby pin in it until I
feel it secure spray it with some
hairspray as well so that you should
don't move now because I do have short
hair short hair struggles obviously the
bottom layer does fall down so I'm gonna
take these clips you can just use bobby
pins if you want I'm gonna put one in
going in right and put one in going in
left that way it's super super secure
and won't fall down just finish it off
with a little bit of hairspray and my
hand just to kind of smooth everything
over now this is totally optional I'm
gonna take a brown eye shadow okay and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use this
to fill in my hairline obviously where
your hair so tight back it can create
kind of bald spots here's a before and
after so you can really see so as you
can see on the left it looks really full
and then on the right it just it's not
as good but yeah that is it that is his
hair all done
so another high bar but this is with
bangs it is pretty much the same thing
but we have her down to frame up this is
something a little bit different so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start my
section off the front bits of my hair
that I want to have down to frame my
face and once I've done that we're going
to rewind guys and I'm gonna repeat the
same thing so gather the hair pull it a
third of the way through mess up in the
middle pinch the sides pin it back so
tuck it all in take the excess hair
cross it over the front take them back
round the back and then just bobby pin
that all in place then this is where
it's different so I'm gonna start sort
of pulling at the root to add a bit more
volume
I'm taking my GHD hair straighteners and
we're gonna curl the front so as you can
see I'm pointing to this side of the
hair straining you'll see I'm gonna turn
it back 180 and it now becomes the back
and then you can just pull it down quite
quickly and you'll end up with a light
wave I literally just repeat that on the
other side I only turn it 180 because
then you get the light wave rather than
a really tight curl if you turn it like
360 I'll just keep turning it as you go
down the tighter the curl I kind of just
run my fingers loosen it and just mess
it up a little bit give it a bit of a
hair spray and I scrunch it at the same
time as well just to keep that shape and
then of course I can't forget to tie up
the little loose bits that I get that
falls down you guys know what I mean
now for one of my faves this is such a
classic the beachy waves I love this
hairstyle in like short I mean I love it
in all hair but sure how think it looks
so fab so I'm gonna start just by
sectioning off my hair above my ears I'm
gonna be section in three sections
because I think I hear it's just a bit
more easier to manage do you HD
straighteners again that's all we're
gonna be using so you wanna clamp down
on the hair go 180 under pull it down a
teeny bit then you're gonna turn it back
up the other way and go down and you're
gonna repeat that it's kinda hard to
explain but hopefully you can kind of
see what I'm doing so I'm kind of going
under pull down a bit over pull down a
bit and just keep repeating that down
the hair and as you can see you get this
sort of light wave and I just repeat
that so again under down a bit over down
a bit under down a bit yeah
just to help even more this is the kind
of wrist action that happens that's the
sort of movement I do and just keep
repeating that if my whole hair take
sections down keep repeating it
boy I love about this hairstyle is what
it's so carefree you can have some bit
style wavy or some bits that are
straighter it really doesn't matter
because it is just a beachy wave and it
has nothing perfect guys can I just say
as well if you struggle to curl your
hair with a straightener try this method
I promise you it is so much easier to
way more user-friendly you don't have to
worry about getting in like a hot mess
or worry about what the straightness
doing really she's so much more carefree
and way easier now once I waved all my
hair I'm gonna take the mark he'll wave
spray I'm just going to spray a little
bit of that on my hand and then just
scrunch it into my hair this creates
more that like beachy tousled wave look
makes it look a little bit piece yeah as
you can see from the right to the left
of course - exactly the same it's to the
other side I like spraying into my hand
rubber lint directly into my hair
because I feel like I have more control
over the product I keep flipping my hair
over by the way I go a little bit crazy
with this and looking alike I keep
flipping and scrunching and then from
here onwards it's all up to you you can
put your part where you want style your
hair oh you want flip it how you want
just get the hair exactly where you want
it I quite like a middle part personally
but totally up to you now I'm gonna take
some hairspray and I'm gonna lift the
hair and spray so I lift and spray I
find that this actually helps with the
volume in my hair as well and then
obviously I get all the layers of my
hair as well and that is it it is as
simple as that
now we have tight curls I love this
hairstyle it's a bit more time-consuming
to do but it lasts in your half like
three or four days it was like so worth
it so I start by piling off my hair I'm
gonna do it up off my ears again like I
said I've quite thick hair so it's
easier for me now I'm using me Marc Hill
corkscrew wand by the way the Marc
you're curling wands are everything if
you're not tried them you Sony - I'm
just gonna take a really small bit of
hair wrap it around the lawn hold it for
anywhere from like five to ten seconds
let it go and you'll have this cute
little tight curl I keep repeating this
over on my entire hair little tip make
sure the hair's flat against the wand so
then the heat is evenly distributed and
it'll curl properly as you can see this
piece here I'm actually curling it
towards my face that's another tip to
get a lot of volume and to make sure the
curls obviously don't all stick together
do some away from your face towards your
face and then you get that variety so
you know you don't know like you've just
got like one big curl on your head just
taking another layer down now someone to
the second out third layers and I'm just
gonna repeat the exact same thing over
my whole head here is the before and
after so you can see how much these cows
give volume and I've not even touched
them yet so when you've curled it all in
your hair's all nice and curled we're
gonna start piecing the cows apart so I
take a curl and just break up into
smaller bits just add more texture and
then I put my hand in and gently shake
nothing too crazy you know we don't end
up like a frizzy mess this will also
help a lot with volume as well obviously
we're actually creating more cows in our
hair by breaking them apart and then
yeah just go in give it another little
shake and then as soon as I'm happy
we're there I'm going of course add some
hairspray to hold the curls do that
whole lifting thing as well now I go
back in with the curling wand and I curl
the two fringe little pieces that will
frame my face I like them to be quite
curly because obviously as soon as you
look at me they're the first thing you
see and then at once I've done that I
would kind of just like a look at my
hair and see what I think needs touching
up don't be afraid to go back in with
your curling wand all I do is I actually
on the top layer of my hair take really
really small bits of hair and make them
really curly because it kind of gives
the illusion that all of your hair is
really curly do you naughty mean and
then guys just keep playing around with
it until you're happy and that is that
has so done
this last hairstyle is these tight curls
but it's half-up half-down so it's a
carry on from the curls that we just did
this is such an easy transformation to
make like a brand new hairstyle guys
you're gonna be so all that I do is I
really really roughly grabbed up half of
my hair you don't need to like a classic
half up half down I leave the front
pieces down though as well then I'm
gonna take a hairband and really really
loosely it's high into a ponytail I do
it loose so as you can see I have room
to pull it the hair and it just makes it
way easier for us I go in really pull it
to create a lot of volume and now these
two bits here I decided that I wanted to
pin them back into the ponytail I want
to thin a bits to frame my face then
once I pinned everything back I kind of
keep adjusting it I don't like it to
look like I've got half-up half-down I
like it to kind of look like I've just
got kind of more layered hair if that
makes sense
and that is it that was a lot of
hairstyles which one was your favorite
like I can't pick a favorite cuz like I
said I love them all if you do have a
favorite though let me know down below
