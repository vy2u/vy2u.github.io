for you guys today I have a get ready
with me on the hair and makeup that I
have on it right now
I was reading the comments on my last
video and the hair and makeup that I had
on one on I didn't have my hair on this
is my own but the look that I had you
guys really wanted to see I was reading
for the comments and I heard you I heard
you
so basically so I'm gonna be showing you
guys today I'm no expert this is
literally just what I do to my hair and
my face pretty much it's my like
everyday routine I don't wear makeup
every single day and I don't necessarily
do this every single day but this is I
might go to look for see if you want to
know how I did this look just keep
watching you're gonna see naked eye
what's a naked Jordan you're definitely
not gonna see naked Jordan next not that
kind of video you're gonna see naked
face Jordan in like 3 ok so I'm gonna do
my makeup first now it's just typically
the way that I like to do like my thing
I always do like makeup then house so
step number one I'm gonna prime my skin
this is the Rihanna I like Fenty beauty
so from a pre filter right now I've been
using it loads recently actually it just
makes a really nice base and it like
preps my skin because you know we're
about to pull like oh crap - the makeup
on it I like it as well just like a soft
matte it feels really like if you're
super like velvety and smooth on my skin
I don't know it just my face feels
prepped my skin is like it's ready I
don't know this is gonna sound like
hella stupid right but I use primer like
all the time when I do my makeup but I
just I just feel like some primers don't
really make like the biggest difference
to my makeup or like anything I don't
know the foundation I've been wearing
the crap out of lately has been at the
maybelline superstay 24 hour full
coverage foundation this stuff is just
amazing
it's just amazing the coverage is bomb
it looks really good on the skin it
lasts really well this was in my 2017
favorites I spoke about it more in that
video which I will link here in the I
just where it is I think so if you do
want to know a little bit more about it
but this shit's good I think if I use
this by itself is probably gonna be a
little bit too dark in the moment just
because you know my fake tan is kind of
like fading away now so I'm going to use
this little guy it's the little Savior
these are the Nippon fab like foundation
drops this one is the light mix
when as you can see it's just like just
white you like to drop these into your
foundation to make it a lighter like
genius and they don't change anything
about the foundation at all they just
kind of like light in it so I'm going to
mix like a little bit over there into my
foundation I think that's a pretty good
match if you ask me yeah oh look at me
already like prepped with the damp you
blend up okay Jordan I'm just gonna
bounce that into my skin sounds a bit
gross in it into my skin look at that
coverage though are you ready are we
ready already bye honestly this
foundation like covers everything I know
for some people this is probably like a
little bit too much on an everyday basis
because like this issue's full coverage
and it's like I mean some people don't
like to wear this much makeup which is
like totally cool but I mean each their
own right like you put as much or as
little makeup on your face as you
personally like like there's no rules to
makeup you know honestly you do whatever
the hell you want to do is your face
boys and girls like put on whatever you
want this is just what I like cuz I mean
if you've been here a while you know I'm
like an all-or-nothing kind of girl so
I'm putting it all on what is this like
a little bump come from I swear that
wasn't that area
what the Frick for concealer I'm gonna
use one of my like Alzheimer 8
concealers and it's drugstore so like
even better this is the Maybelline fit
me concealer in at number 20 or by the
way my foundation was in it caramel
beige I'll try like remember to tell you
colors and stuff but if I forget because
like let's be real this is me and I
probably will just give the description
busted cheek and it'll click and
everything will be there like colors
products everything I'm just gonna like
put a little bit underneath my eyes a
little bit more like the old tube Jordan
I just freaking love this concealer
because it's super like thin and it
blends out really nicely but the
coverage is so good
just looks kind of natural natural I
mean that's natural his makeup look I go
back in with the booty blend out and
just blend that in wow I bounce so
quickly on my face I know I just
realized like look at that it literally
bends out like so easily I don't even
have to try anything where I don't have
to try them here for it I'm here for it
now - of course sets this in place
because you know I'd rather my face like
not fly off do you know what I mean this
is another product that I spoke about in
my 20 17 favorites of course a lot of
products by upon my face today are in
that video because you know they're my
favorites
this is the beauty of bakery a flower
setting a powder this is the like
translucent one and then for underneath
my eyes I do kind of bake a little bit
just because I love the way this powder
like smooths out my skin and dab my
little dab it in here and then just pack
it on under my eyeball I kind of like do
the sides of my nose as well because you
know well I've said this so many times
my gets so oily in the t-zone so I have
to make sure I like proper set my face
just so I can kind of like attempt to
control that and I just use the same
powder to set my face as well it's gonna
sound really weird bye make sure I like
set my eyebrows really well as well
because I use a pencil to fill my
eyebrows I of course want it to be set
because I don't want pencil to glide on
top of like foundation and slip around
and stuff so that's why I do that my air
freshener is trying to like get involved
now so do my eyebrows so as of recently
I run out of my benefit precisely my
brow pencil which makes me like Heather
sad and I get a little motion when I
think about it so just won't talk about
it but I found this eyebrow pencil in
Primark it's their skinny brow pencil in
brown and you know what I love this it's
actually really nice like it's a really
nice color it works really well I don't
have any complaints I have been picking
this up for the past like two weeks and
I'm not even mad at it and you know it's
even better right the pencil twists up
love that and it has a spoolie as well
on the other end for my eyebrows I kind
of just follow the natural shape you can
kind of see what kind of shape is there
and then I just fill it in a bit more so
it doesn't look so like a gapi so I
start kind of underneath my eyebrow like
this and I draw a little line and then
for some reason this eyebrow has like no
tail on it just doesn't look right
apparently so I'm just gonna kind of
like extend that oh yeah we good and
then I fill in on top that's well kind
of creating the shape that I want as
well as I go along and then also I've
got the shape that I kind of like one
I'm gonna kind of lightly start to fill
it in with really short strokes to kind
of like mimic hairs and then for the
front on my eyebrows switch up a little
bit and I bring in a new product I
actually been really enjoying using a
powder at the front because obviously a
powder is so so soft and really easy to
blend out so you know I don't get that
harsh like I love this one this is the
benefit foolproof
for our powder this is the little shape
of an eyebrow on a angled up brush I
take the darker one I basically just
start to like pull it up for the front
of my eyebrow like this through you know
just until I kind of get the fade and
like intensity that I worn it's pretty
easy they're just kind of like feather
it through like this I go in and I draw
a little eyebrow hairs with the pencil
just to make it look even more I don't
know brow II where's my top sheet deep I
used a little bit of these heart-shaped
tape concealer just because it's a
little bit thicker than the Maybelline
and it really like will carve out my
brow and yeah I use it to cover my brow
whoa concentration there's something so
satisfying about doing that to you
eyebrows oh yeah of course and then I
like to set it in place with the ICO
tinted gel brow booster this stuff just
like grabs onto every single hair and
like really makes it stand out I love
how I'm doing my makeup in like the
tiniest mirror ever Wow and then I come
to the realization that I've got to try
and like mimic this on this eyebrow
because I have already shown you guys
and you know I don't want to sit here
and bore you with like doing my eyebrows
for the next hour I'm sorry with the
power of editing BAM I like kind of
magic also by the way I'm fully aware
that this eyebrow is like lower than
this eyebrow I don't know why my
eyebrows are just naturally like that
there's not much there's not much I can
do I'm just kind of working with one car
now I'm gonna like dust this off because
you know that's been there for a hot
minute now okay so my face needs a
little bit of color cuz you know I'm
lacking I'm lacking in that right now
this is like the best bronzer they would
ever use in your goddamn life if you
guys haven't tried it like what are you
doing you need it like right now let get
your ass sounds like a dab gnomes or
something or like order online because
you know who's got time to go out like I
haven't in my room no but for real
though the makeup forever Pro bronze
fusion mine's in at 25 al this stuff is
in it it's like the perfect color the
perfect finished the perfect everything
oh my god what's happened to my brush
like can you see that like the bristles
alright what's my hair doing
rude I love this brush for bronzer
though it's so good I used to love like
a bigger brush you know I could really
like just bronze up everywhere like
super quickly
I feel like this brush still does it
quickly but
has a little bit more precision so I
don't end up with like basically just an
entire face that just looks like bronze
uh-huh it's the morphe e4 I recommend I
do like the cheeks and then like the
forehead temple here we are gonna bring
it down here I basically do do my entire
face what am I talking about little bit
here just because I've always I feel
like this is super bright and this is
like really turned and then it just
looks a little bit weird I don't know
what it is but I can legit keep just
like adding bronze onto my face for the
rest of my life like put it down drunk
put it down
can you like kind of see as well how the
bones are has like a really nice glow to
it like most cheeks ik really like shiny
shiny I'm not sure that's a word gonna
kind of do some contouring now just to
like attempt like attempt don't get like
too ahead of ourselves now to bring like
a little bit of shape back because I
mean face you know you guys know makeup
geek complicated contour on a like huge
fan brush like this is look at that two
texts done I just love this brush it
literally does all the work for me like
places it where I want it but it blends
out at the same time it's flat this is a
really really like affordable blush this
blush is one pound no trick though I
always reach for it this is the anyway
blush in the color cupcake cupcake that
is so damn cute I actually like say my
blush on I like joy fiber stippling
brush thing right the layers because I
feel like it picks up less product with
blush like that's the thing I want less
on my face I feel like it can go like
Crale Ike real quick it just kind of
adds like a little bit more color back
to my face I don't know I've got one eye
closed right now this highlighter I mean
I've been like non-stop
obsessed with I feel like I spend on my
face for the past like two three weeks
like straight yes the models only scoped
enquirer highlight powder in zero Brown
at golden sand really quickly I'm just
gonna mac's fix+ my face the last video
that I use this thing you guys pointed
out the noise that I made it just like
cracks me up every time it's like are we
ready for this I don't know if you guys
are ready to finish come through I'm
like a glazed doughnut Krispy Kreme
realness right now little bit on QP I've
been out in a little bit up here
recently because I feel like it kind of
when you turn to the side it kind of
just like joins in
with your highlight on your cheekbones
you know what I mean just uh put your
glasses on because I do like to go back
in then just tell my beauty blender and
just press it into the skin for make
sure you know everything just sort of
melts together right okay so the main
part of this makeup look that you guys
actually wanted me to show you was how I
do my eyeliner so many of you asked me
it was like kind of gray I didn't I
didn't like expect it my everyday
everyday I don't even wear makeup every
day but like you know what I mean my
everyday look at the moment has been
like no eye shadow just a bold wing and
I've been loving it so I'm going to show
you how I do it I'm just taking some of
my concealer though to begin with to put
on my eyelids just laughs like a super
blank canvas Oh
pooped myself taking the same powder and
just whacking on my eyelids just so that
we get no crease edge because you know
not about that life
so the best liquid eyeliner that I have
personally ever tried is this little guy
here this is the NYX matte liquid
eyeliner okay right before I do this I
just want to point out I'm really not
the best explaining things so if this
goes like tits up I'm really sorry
obviously you can see what I'm doing
well I like it I'll try I try my best
okay so first of all I draw a line from
like the outer corner of my eye to like
the tail of my eyebrow and I make sure
that it's quite like flat here rather
than angled up like this I kind of make
it more for that I told you all I get X
pending things and then from the end of
it here I bring it back in towards the
middle of my eye I like my I don't have
to go all the way into the inner corner
so I'm just going to do that real quick
and then at this point okay right this
is pretty much the only way I can
explain it I like my eyeliner at the top
so when I kind of look down I like it to
look like a straight line I also go
ahead and thicken up a little bit cuz I
like quite a chunky wing I thought that
suits my eye shape a little bit better I
really wish I could speak to you while I
was doing this for the concentration
that's needed for a wing it's just too
real pretty much what I go for obviously
it looks ten times better when I have
eyelashes on I mean this is personally
how I like to have my eyeliner obviously
depending on your eye shape will depend
on how you do your wing my eyes are kind
of hooded slightly on the outer corner
so I kind of have to pull my wing out a
little bit further so that I don't get
too much of a dent like here it doesn't
droop down too much here
eyeliner is literally practice practice
practice practice that's all I did the
more you practice the more you get used
to your eye shape and the better it like
is for you so keep going any girls and
boys you've got this my island is like
my freakin eyebrows I got to try and
repeat there
now also I am a totally contradicting
myself here when I say this because I'm
doing it right now try not to do your
winged eyeliner in the most smallest
mirror of your entire life especially if
you struggle at eyeliner because you end
up doing one eye like by itself and
you're not looking at the other eye at
the same time and you end up like they
end up looking like two completely like
different wings this wing will end up
looking like it belongs I don't know
like a freaking eagle and this one a
pigeon so I think that is about as good
as we are gonna get I feel like this
one's slightly bigger than this one but
it's fine a little bit of mascara now
this is my favorite the Maybelline lash
sensational but when I wear lashes to be
honest any mascara I just whack on it's
just so I can blend my real lashes in
with the false ones I just do it really
really quickly as well because again I'm
not too fussed about how these look
because you know falsies now I don't
really have a specific pair that I wear
like 24/7 am I like right or died really
I have so many lashes that I kind of
just like go through them and try
different ones out but I have been
wearing these ones a lot recently these
are by backstage lashes they've come up
with some new ones and they have like a
similar style you know got really wispy
and like but they're like really
affordable at the same time these are in
the style called date night I'll try and
show you guys how I am stick on my
lashes as well because I read the
comments I see yeah I mean I'll attempt
to I don't really know what I'm doing
half the time I make me baepsae so I put
a wreath in let you calm me see but I've
put a really nice thin layer of Gulu as
you can see there I'm gonna wait like 20
to 30 seconds I'd say it just so it goes
a little bit tacky err so that when we
put on our eyes not slipping and sliding
and we've got our pair of tweezers
always helps I change to a different
drink because my run run out this is how
I do it so I grab the eyelash in the
middle like that and I place it down in
the middle of my eye first as close to
my lash line as I can get it the easiest
way I find is well if you look down into
a mirror like this you can really see
your lash line and then I pull the outer
corner down like that oh ain't a blink
and then I pull down the inner corner
squeeze my like real lashes and the
false ones together at the root as much
as I can and that's it I say that's it
like it's super easy I know it's not
like the easiest thing again so number
one is like makeup steps I feel like you
need to keep
practicing it actually is easier to
stick on eyelashes that you've already
worn before it's like they kinda went
mole to your eyeball tada
they're not perfect by any means but at
least they're actually on my lines how
am I actually going to get this off it's
in the place where my highlighter so
maybe if I use my brush like this it
might come off you know I know it's for
a lot of you false eyelashes on an
everyday basis is not practical I
totally get it but for me I've won them
so much now I can stick them on in like
two seconds it's it's pretty easy for me
but you know that some days I'm just not
feeling an eyelash you know it's just
not an eyelash kind of day if I'm like
that I'll coat on there maybe in las and
sash chopped a good'n we're so damn
close to finishing the makeup guys or
we've got left his lips
I think the second most thing the second
most does that make sense was like
English probably not the second thing
that you guys really wanted to know what
I had on was on my lips so this is what
I had I used the bleach london little
lip kit combo thing so it comes with a
liquid lipstick and also a lip liner
which is so called this is in the color
bleached it's an amazing nude brown so i
start with a lip liner just to get the
shape throw on
and then at the liquid lipstick oh
that's such a good cuddler this liquid
lipstick is so freakin nice it's really
really comfortable bleach london coming
out with makeup though their purple
shampoo and conditioner oh my god it's
the best purple shampoo and conditioner
ever all of us have blonde hair so I
kind of want a publisher barrier to keep
it looking blonde so so good and now
they've come out with little lip kits so
cute and then just wait for this to dry
I love to put on a gloss at the moment I
love a good glossy lip me I wore in the
video and I won't let no one stop at the
moment it's the Maybelline vivid hot
lacquer in the color unreal it matches
perfectly with this look it's like its
lip gloss baby and you just wanna make
sure this is fully dry first so it
doesn't go like sticky on me
look how glossy this is though then to
finish off with a little bit of setting
spray this is the Tarte rainforest of
the sea one but to be honest I just use
like whatever so yeah that is it for my
makeup and now it's time to like do
something with my hair off my hair and
makeup hair was definitely the one that
you guys were like you want to see how
you do it Jordan show us guys it is so
easy the curly ones I used is my mark
he'll pick a mix wand in small while
that's heating up just so that you know
I have a blunt like haircut my house all
one length and it's just bluntly cut has
not been chopped into if you go into a
hairdressers then you say can you blunt
cut my hair they'll know exactly what
you mean I have that because I like to
have the thickness and volume in my hair
especially now that is short I feel like
it kind of like needs that do you not I
mean it's legit one of the easiest
haircuts out there could you let you
just like chop and that's it section it
off just above my ears first just so I
can get these like underneath pieces
curled I can get to them a little bit
easier if that makes any sense
bring in that heat protectant because
you know we care about our hair all that
I do is take like a decent sized you
know chunk of hair I'll say that's I'm
an inch I wrap it around the curling
wand and I kind of leave a bit off the
end of the hair can you see that I'm
leaving it out so it's kind of straight
hold it for like five six seconds let it
go and as you can see you get like a
little leaf the wavy coat grab another
chunk do exactly the same thing
and then this piece I'm actually gonna
do towards my face every so often I do a
curl that goes towards my face just to
break up the curls a little bit so they
don't all kind of stick together but
just make sure that all the pieces
especially that around your face you do
it away so you know nothing like comes
in and I just pretty much do this around
my entire head so basically the things I
keep in mind when I do it I do some cows
away from my face somewhat towards my
face I leave the ends a little bit
straighter so it looks a little bit more
beachy you know nothing kind of tight
and then I just make sure that the hair
around my face goes away from my face I
hope that all makes sense but hopefully
you're bound to see when I do it and
it'll make a little bit more sense oh
and also make sure your hair is like
flat around the barrel so that the heat
goes like evenly along the hair if that
makes sense
otherwise you can end up with like a
really weird curl that's not like
properly curled it's just it's just a
bit like myth when I get to the top
layer I part my hair in the middle and
then curly I find that the easiest way
it's a curl my hair and like the
quickest and then I can kind of like
play around with it after and get it to
look how I want I mean sure
you literally always know what drinks
mine just look for the lipstick okay so
my hair is all waved I'm not personally
gonna leave it like this I'm passing out
my head to be like big and messy once
everything's cooled I pretty much just
go like in shake everything out
oh my god it's tuck away the gloss this
stuff here is like the key to the
texture this is the hair by Stan
McKnight cool go up texture missed all
that I basically do is kind of lift up
my hair like they're spray a little bit
in lift spray lift spray into the root
as well I really like it as a middle
part Bart I've been wearing it more as
like the side part recently I'm just
gonna start doing a little bit of
teasing just so I can we really keep the
volume so if I'm actually like going out
it will stay in it won't go like flat
you don't have to do this step I just
like it cuz it keeps everything in they
want some kind of happy with that I just
give it a little bit of hairspray I've
run out of my little Rio l net so I'm
using this JH do you want and I don't
really love it but it's all that I have
so I took this bit behind my ear as well
I don't know really know why I just do
sometimes it doesn't go I was like
easiest there sometimes I have to go
back here with my curling wand and touch
bits up or I might have to tease more or
add more texture or whatever but today
it's gone like okay but I just basically
keep playing with it until I can exactly
how I personally like it pretty much I
would say the key to my hair is a little
bit of tease in some hairspray and then
definitely this texture mist I think
this is the most important thing now in
my like short hair routine so yeah that
is it you guys that is pretty much how I
do my like everyday hair and makeup look
basically this is pretty much how I go
to look I really hope you guys enjoyed
