going to be showing you guys my current
everyday makeup routine it is what I'm
wearing right now now just a little like
disclaimer I guess I hate saying that
but like just a little bit of info I
know this is going to be a lot of makeup
to some people I guess it is but I'm the
kind of girl that I will Eva wear like a
full phase or nothing at all like I
don't really have an in-between I'm not
saying this is what an everyday makeup
look should look like and this is just
my take and what I love to do when I do
my makeup and I'm also just show you
guys the products I've been loving at
the moment so you guys can just take
whatever you like from this video I also
asked you guys on my Twitter if you
wanted a talk-through or a voiceover and
talked through one by a mile so this
might be a bit of a longer video so just
like chill grab a cup of tea but no I'm
going to shut up now so if you do want
to see how we've done this makeup adjust
keep watching we are up closed and
Parsifal today I'm going to start with
brows and to fill them in I have been
loving this freedom I proper made in it
medium brown oh you go choose this all
the dropping it the Anastasia Beverly
Hills brow definer game medium brown by
actually find this pomade to be a lot
quicker and easier for me to use and
then to apply it I used this Primark
brush if you've been here a while you'll
know that I love this brush just going
to grab a little bit of that product and
fill in my brows so just like a quick
thing of my brows because I'm going to
like speed through this part because it
takes forever I start towards the tail
of my brow and work in words just to the
lattice point is towards like the inner
part of my brow
I know that they look like really bold
and crazy right now but it's because
I've got like no makeup on and then just
to set my brows in place to make sure
that they don't like fly away for other
day I use the benefit gimme brow in
number five number five I just love this
brush like go look how Diddy
that is like that is adorable that's my
brows in place and also like picks up on
the hairs and my eyebrows to like make
them look more kind of like hairier
that's gross like a full primer I've
only recently started using this again
but this is the benefit Porefessional I
love this stuff I think everybody and
the mothers have used it I just use my
fingers by the way and I just press that
into like my t-zone area it just really
helps to smooth out my skin and like
just create a really nice base for my
makeup okay so for my foundation being
even one of these so it's evil L'Oreal
True Match which I have been using for
the longest time and I love this I'm in
for W if you're wondering but as of
recently because this has been more of a
recent purchase I've been using the
Milani conceal unperfect two-in-one
foundation and concealer my colors sand
beige which is number six a probably
good guy bit lighter just a heads up
this does oxidize ever so slightly so
you might want to like move down to
shake out the past few weeks I've been
using this brush here which I've been
freaking obsessed with like this is the
morphe m43 9 brush it's just like a
round top like buffer brush and you'll
see a few morphe brush in this video
because i and then turn it all over my
skin obviously i'm matching my
foundation to my neck which is vile it's
a different color and but this
foundation is super thick but it has a
really good coverage it lasts a really
really long time on me as well it does
say on the back of it they medium to
full coverage lightweight oil-free
formula long wearing water resistant and
sweat proof so for all my oily skin
people other try it and it's drugstore
as well like yes please I consider I
have been using the LA girl Pro
conceal been using this for so long and
I love it and see with this or mac
prolongwear but quite honestly like I
think using this is your job I got it
once in light ivory as well by the way
and I just draw some tribal pain on my
face tonight Dorothy and I have been
obsessed with this brush this is the
morphe e 8 brush and i think this is
named like the like a small precision
contour brush or something but for my
concealer this is amazing
it's like dense enough that it keeps the
product where it's meant to be but soft
enough they just like blends the product
out really really well then we've just
whatever is left on the brush I run that
on top of my eyelids just to like prime
them for later and now I just go in with
a sponge this one is the Real Techniques
one just to make sure that everything is
like really blended together this takes
two seconds but honestly I can't not do
this everything in place I do like to
kind of bake I knew for a few minutes
though not long just to kind of make
sure everything is kind of creaseless
and it just sets everything really well
in my opinion so to do this I use the
RCM a no color powder and I just mmm a
little bit of full pop it underneath my
eyes and then of course I set the rest
of my face I use remorse a matte which I
mean mine is just well loved like come
on Jordan can do already
so how many of you asked about this in
my DIY video because these were shown
and you were all like what brushes are
they because I like pink in rose gold
and like so pretty he's actually a Brad
called backstage um and this one is the
angled powder brush I don't know many
people talk about these but honestly
these are amazing I love these brushes I
use them every single day
there are literally so soft quick tip I
just want to share with you guys how I
get my makeup to kind of sit really like
nicely and smoothly on my skin is I
actually shave my face so some you be
like oh yeah man
but we all get peach fuzz on our face
that's completely normal so I'm going in
with a normal razor that you do
on the rest of your body don't do that
gland from me that like broke me out and
irritate my skin it just awesome pretty
actually use these razors here these are
eyebrow razors but obviously you can use
them to like do all over your face and
these are incredible so good so I put
mine from eBay I think and then to just
warm up my skin I don't really contour
in an everyday basis I just sort of
bronze up when do I use I think I'm
going to go for this one um but this is
Rosie for autograph so autograph is a
Marks and Spencers brand if you didn't
know um and it looks like this to apply
er I use another morphe brush like what
a surprise this is the morphe m-52 seven
brush like this is the perfect size and
shape to just like fit perfectly what am
i doing
but usually a blush girl but I've been
obsessed with this color this is makeup
geek and infatuation which is such a
pretty like rosy pink color and then to
apply it i'm using the morphe 4 this is
the best blush brush I have ever used
like ever gonna work it like onto the
apples of the cheeks back yeah literally
can't do my highlighter
without this product it's amazing it
this is the body shop honey bronze like
cream highlighter I guess it just
creates the most perfect base for my
highlighter to go on now you could
literally put this on and be done but
I'm extra with my highlight and I you
like pile it on so I mean I just take my
finger just because I find that it warms
it up into the skin and it presses it in
perfectly okay I switch up my
highlighter all the time I have so many
and I just switch them up as I go along
to be honest but this sleek highlight
and palettes are freaking amazing
and they'll one of my favorites so I'm
going to include it in this video and
then I use the morphe M 501 brush this
is the perfect highlighting brush like
it just fits perfectly on here and it's
nice and tapered so the product gets
distributed really nicely I just got
this little brush oh my god like look at
that what even
and now I've been taking this backstage
shadow shader brush which is just like a
little flat brush and just being it
using that to highlight like my nose and
my Cupid's bow just because it's like
the perfect shape and size I just get a
much more like precise application with
this little brush for my everyday kind
of eye shadow I've been at loving this
Urban Decay Naked ultimate basics
palette just looks like this and they
are all matte shades as well I just love
it I'm going to take the color called
pre-game which is just this yellow shade
I'm just going to set my lips with this
really really quickly
now using a nyx number 16 brush which is
just like a really big fluffy blending
brush i'm going to take extra bitter
which is just the orange here just
lightly these are pigmented so tap I'm
just literally working this into and
above my crease
I tend to just go really easy and quick
with my eye shadow on an everyday basis
just because I'm more about liner and
lashes as opposed to the eye shadow so
then I go in with a sigma e30 8 which is
the distance or the diffuse to crease
brush there we go I go in with a mixture
of faith and lockout which would just
these brown shades here and I'm just
going to keep this lower and more kind
of in the crease
then Bethlehem my arm is back fall off
so now for eyeliner I'm of course taking
my Primark eyeliner this is a pound and
this is one of the best eyeliners I
think I've ever used if you can't get
hold on the Primark one another really
good drugstore one is the Rimmel glam
eyes as well and I'm just going to wing
it out I do quite a thick wing I can't
really explain it sorry hopefully you
guys will be able to see the only
guideline that I have is when I kind of
look down at my mirror like this like
with my head tilt back is that the
eyeliner has like a straight line from
the outer corner into the middle
I think there's about as even as I'm
going to get them today I do apply um
full slashes so usually just go in with
any old mascara this one is the volume
million lashes so Couture ones by
L'Oreal I literally just put a really
quick layer of this on my lashes once
I've been wearing like everyday have
been these ones these are the backstage
lashes in the style Melrose Avenue these
are the same as those on this is not the
same brand as those pink brushes so this
is what they look like they're just like
different lengths and really fluttery I
love these
proposed on the I the easiest way I find
to apply my lashes is I place them down
like in the middle first and then I just
like attach the outer and inner corner
these lashes though are just
ridiculously easy to apply in my opinion
they just like fall onto my eye I'm just
now taking the same colors that we used
in our crease earlier just to learn that
underneath my eye a little then a for my
lips I'm just lining them with this NYX
retractable lip liner in the color nude
and but I have been using this Gerard
cosmetics Hydra matte liquid lipstick in
a color skinny dip for I've been wearing
like a pinky nude it's probably been
this home I love it
such a really color
the formula of these is incredible as
well they are really matte but really
hydrating at the same time like I never
remember that I'm wearing it it's real
it some days I'll just leave it like
this but if I want a bit of a lighter
nude I just take some of my concealer on
my finger and I just pop it on top it
just makes the pink a little bit lighter
so it just depends on feeling this is
the completed look I hope you guys
