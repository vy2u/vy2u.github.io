not by myself today I'm joined by a mama
lips cameraman hi guys you may actually
know her well if you watch my vlogs then
you would have seen egg she husband in
my vlogs and if you don't watch my vlogs
thing you oh you can go and watch
life of Tom my mum prefers life Oh Tom's
right I don't
you're my favorite youtuber and if you
have own kind of like see my vlogs or
anything what I will do is in the I
above my mom's head here I will leave a
little link so you can go like click on
it check it out if you want to as you
probably can tell right now I have a
naked face I have no makeup on there is
a reason for that today's video is gonna
be mum choose it on my makeup
blindfolded and with whatever she
chooses and hope that actually turns out
alright the reason why we did it
blindfolded is because um well my mom
watches my videos and she is like fully
aware of what I like why use all the
time you know all of that stuff so we
thought if we did it blindfolded she
literally have no idea what she picked
she won't know shade she won't know
colors you know she could pick out like
a white foundation and a green lip this
is truth we're gonna find out what she
picks and I have to try and come up with
some sort of makeup look put it on my
face and I'm gonna see how it goes if
you want to see what makeup my mom picks
and then also how my face turns out then
just give us him I've ever seen in my
life right we go in we go in let's go
pick some makeup man I'm dead I'm done I
don't really smoke bomb why does he look
like someone actually coming on and just
had pooed on my head okay so I think I
have all the makeup in front of me that
my mom has chose and quite honestly I
have no idea what I'm gonna get
it could have been a lot worse like a
lot I'm kind of Aki I guess but I just I
have like a crate of my block it's fine
you've got this just so you know as well
we tried to keep it like as minimum as
we possibly could obviously that was so
much more we could've chose glitters and
pigments and just everything but I feel
like this video it's gonna be quite long
as it is so let's just do this oh my
unlike the Disney Channel or something
right I'm gonna start with brows and
eyes because I feel like this is gonna
be a hot mess so I at least want to try
make my face look somewhat these aren't
brows let's see okay Wow becoming our
possibility gonna get little bit
complicated because it's all why brows
stuff but as you can see it's dish does
not yeah you can't see yeah I can pass
me your hand right so basically in this
little section that you're in now I
brought something is in there and this
one yeah yep I'm really dreading there's
like really terrific okay already the
color I like okay yeah thanks what she
chose at this little guy this is the
Loreal brow artist expert pencil thingy
majiggy and guys she chose the color
cool brunette so it should match me and
I really like this eyebrow pencil as
well so mom you did get let me just tuck
these away that's good look let's just
go in let's just do it
oh I think we're safe with the eyebrow I
literally have like blondes and stuff in
my eyebrows she actually could have
chosen a color that was just like
non-existent on my face I will really
try though because I actually do on this
makeup to like help you guys like if you
have the products or whatever I do kind
of you know what I'm maybe be able to
show you what you can do with them but
this is me this is me and I'm just a
little bit of a hot mess
dddd honestly filling in this scarf for
my eyebrows like a collar and Burke I'm
just like ignore whole like messy this
is I promise I will clean up I'm
swearing a jit melting in my room right
now I look so pale today so so pay off
because he's lights cuz they're quite
close to me it kind of washes me out a
little bit Miami wean
oh no crap I've just remembered the
concealer my mom got is so dark I'm
going to use some other foundation
because it's lighter I mean this is
gonna be good as net my foundations are
lighter than my concealer
there is something so satisfying about
cleaning up an eyebrow yes Wow okay
these eyebrows are low-key kind of
tragic today but whatever you know when
you spend so long on your eyebrows and
you just like I'm over it I'm done can
we move all huh move on Jordan get over
it get over it like you get over an ex
boyfriend right now we're gonna get you
to choose a gel eyebrow like saying gel
are you I'm going yeah for eyebrow gel
she picked out the NYX control freak
eyebrow gel and I actually really like
this having no notice that before why
does that I can't stop smelling it ain't
hate it but don't even know where that
smells like but it's most hella strong
and my nostrils are kind of burning a
little bit but you know what it's not
about eyebrow gel at all it's just a job
or on to eyeshadow is now so I have
actually three drawers of palettes
here's draw one draw two and then at the
bottom two or three do you just want to
choose like say one two or three and
we're just yes see that I'm taking any
which is this one this has like a mix
mix Matt okay what my say a mixture of
stuff that I use and stuff that I kind
of don't really use so go him go crazy
yeah yeah okay this is the one she chose
you know what my mom actually chose a
really good palette for this I mean I
haven't used it probably I've not had
like a proper play around but it looks
like right up my street this is the NYX
fire palette by the way she picked out a
lot of NYX it's not sponsored but so
these are the colors here I don't even
know what to go for this color here this
like bluey Brown I really use that you
know what there's just do something
different I've not done you on my
channel why the heck not I'm gonna stop
this kinda here well oh the color just
keeps coming and coming I did not think
it'd be that pigmented just keep
blending Jordan just keep I think I
managed to say that honestly this is
just a story but I see this is what
happens when I new news new use and use
new things you know
what though that blended so easily you
know what you can always rely on X
honestly what color should we go for now
I'm gonna do the purple let's do it you
know what those so far I am loving this
eyeshadow palette the way the colors
just like blend into each other is
exactly what I want gonna keep building
it up back and forth your arms gonna
start a can and it might fall off but
it's fine like it's all part of the
process I think I'm gonna do some sort
of like cut crease situation you know
I'm using the foundation to this by the
way not cheating oh my god I really hope
this looks okay new and you kind of just
do something and wing it literally me
right now well that just looks janky oh
hello when the concentration is so
ruined the whole room goes dead sigh
then get a DD brush now so I can get
like right here I feel like I'm really
far away but my camera doesn't zoom so
this is like literally as close I can
get the next one this little section up
to here
oh just here is liquid is just this
little section you're saying a little
section but you could choose like a
green eyeliner or something mum really
yeah there's no white one ah why
eyeliner for eyeliner she picked out the
NYX
everything's NYX I swear liquid liner
but as you can see it's white don't get
me wrong like this is the best white
liquid iron I've ever tried but I just
don't really know what to do with it
oh so much flow now
how does that look I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore
um can you see this I have to go clean
my house I'm gonna clean up this I
though you know what this guy have
camera I'm gonna do this I real quick
and then I'll be that mascara you guess
there it is another next product I
promised the face products on next this
is the double stacked mascara better be
can be honest with you guys
not its biggest fan they just you went
on my own subtle he's alright do you
really mean like I don't love it I don't
hate it either it's just just kind of
there plus it doesn't matter too much
any weeks I am about to pawn some false
lashes then the next thing is lashes I
feel like I put my hand in front yeah
lady spiders a bit more delicate yeah
cuz something will kind of open like
because I'm a little bit grace and like
okay you chose the little case then it's
got those different eyelashes in you
know I'm just gonna go for it I'm gonna
choose the most like longest and
craziest eye ashes in there a little bit
of glue these are so long quick but yeah
this is super pretty though like I can
mess with these by the way if you are
wondering what they aren't pretty sure
they're by backstage and I think they're
called ladies who lunch
I think Real Talk though lashes just
complete any look like you can have any
I look on you stick on some eyelashes
and it just feels like put together
right okay so I think my eyes are pretty
much done so let's move on to the base
the primers like this whole section here
this is all primers oh this in here yeah
hey camera image this one yeah okay I
have actually have never used this
before but
there's one's gone the primer I got has
to choose two because the first one she
picked out was more of just like an
illuminating base and I'm worried more
of like a primer as well generally
primer
these are the two she picks the first
one this is the Millie Mackintosh luxe
glow of face illuminator I have never
used this in my life
that is gold AF do I like that too I
know I can't quite tell like I like how
bronzy and stuff is but it's kind of
making me look like my face is super
muddy it's just like smearing as well
look benefit professional where you at
baby I need you to I need you to help I
love this primer so like it's it's so
fine oh my God look oh my god it's just
like mixing with it this is this is not
good right where's the foundation up I
need to like cover this I have two
drawers of foundations this one and this
one in here this one has like a bunch of
new foundations and like shades that
aren't even really my shade so we'll
just ER
we're wrong with it can I go like right
to the back yeah yeah you can choose you
can choose anything
that one this one yeah okay foundation
you know what she picked a pretty a good
one it's not my favorite foundation ever
but the coverage is good so I'm not
complaining I need to cover this so this
is the UM decay all nighter liquid
foundation and she picked 4.0 I do have
6.0 in there as well but that is like
pretty dark so 4.0 I think will be
pretty good good job um can you see this
like this is a pretty thick foundation
I'm gonna start with a brush and then I
use a sponge now I know this might look
kind of light to begin with I just like
knocked my hoop but this part this
foundation does actually oxidize so it
will get a little bit darker this is
full ass coverage and look at that it
just covers literally everything right
let's Pete you blend us in do you magic
food blender foundation lips I feel like
I'm in year 7 again so this one you
might actually want to like kneel for
like halfway down now we're here so I'll
pull this out only at the front of there
this is concealers this one yeah like
I'm gonna leave again we'll find out
you'll find out you'll find out this is
where we run into a little bit like a
kind of momen amazingly he and my mom
picked the concealer to the foundation
like honestly what the chance is I have
this concealer in three shades but my
mum picked the darkest one which is
medium dark neutral oh my god this is
legit darker than the foundation sugar
well making it too what if I mix in some
of the foundation I mean it hasn't like
brightened or anything but at least we
don't look too crazy God mom what was
she thinking she's a medium dark neutral
mums look
where I'm like adding in some of the
foundation as well my skin is time to
feel so like heavy oh my god I swear the
concealers got darker piccola concealer
oxidizes and like the foundation it's
not like the worst thing I've ever seen
but right we're on the same draw but you
going to the back now for powders can
you she's having a rummage I don't know
why I'm rummaging really do you don't
have a clue I guess it's just like it is
like yeah okay for powder she picked out
the MUA pressed powder in translucent
which I wasn't mad at to be honest like
I don't I don't really have an opinion
on this powder I don't hate it I don't
love it it's just a powder
I'm really happy she picked a
translucent one I have a few in there
that are colored and they just don't
really work oh and I have them you know
more HD powders and they flush back like
a little bitch so I'm so glad she chose
this one let's set these beautiful under
eyes I have no dimension to my face
right now it literally just looks like a
mask bronzers in this drawer
this is all bronzer so you can that you
just don't have what do you think oh I'm
pretty sure I've never ever used this
bronzer it looks really kind of like
glittery and I'm not like the biggest
fan of glittery bronzers oh my god
I have a huge itch can you guys see what
I mean like it's super kind of shimmer
out if the camera is gonna pick it out
it's the beauty pie Sun dust / honestly
why won't this itch go Sun dust powder
does a face and body bronzer okay
that is like warm now I know I say like
a warm bronzer but that's like whoa I
think it's a tad bit to oranjee for me I
was more kind of worried about the
shimmer to be honest I was really
worried it was gonna look kind of
glittery in a bit like on the skin that
it's really not that bad
general I actually don't hate this the
more I'm seeing on my skin the more I'm
like actually okay good choice mama so
this whole thing is blush there's not
much of the bat any one thing at the
back but it's right yeah okay I'm not
only too sure why I put this in my blush
shorts meniscus is actually a vivid
baked highlighter it's fine it's fine
well it'll be a blush is it the makeup
revolution vivid baked highlighter in
rose gold lights let's see how this goes
I don't remember the last time I use
this oh look at that glow I am gonna go
more like handy cuz I have actually got
a highlight palette to use I've actually
just realized the bronze I had shimmer
to it this has shimmer to it and I'm
putting on a highlighter well in this
draw is these are like contour palettes
right here Thomas lowdown let's go for
saying I think I just wanna be cheeky
okay okay I wanted to be able to contour
so I got her to pick out a palette
because then it has something in there
anyway this is the once you pick the
Rimmel Kate like trio thing which comes
with a highlight bronzer and blush brush
oh my god blush maybe we can get some
like more pink yes that's pretty dark
I rarely ever reach for this to be
honest because I always think it's too
dark but actually as soon as it's on the
skin it really isn't that bad oh wait
okay I think I spoke too soon Wow it
definitely is dark now it looks like
I've got a muddy patch here I'm high
light everyone's favorite part well if
it couldn't be popping you're not in
this drawer it's all like liquid
highlighters and single highlighters and
then in this one I have highlight
palettes it's basically a choice whether
you want a palette or whether you want
like a single one parlor on a palette
okay cool oh I know I am so excited for
because I've never used this this is the
iconic London under well let me just say
iconic do highlighters pretty damn good
this is their shimmer palette
oh this is what it looks like you can
see I've actually never used this holy
crap they're pretty I'm gonna take this
one called shimmer and shine iconic
didn't let me down I think the glow from
all the other skin products as well as
really having this to kind of like pop
it'll be more of a dryer for me you know
more like a dryer highlighter but it's
pretty um it's pretty good going yeah
it's to the glow really quickly before I
do lips I'm just gonna add some of this
eyeshadow just underneath my eye just to
finish everything off
so the very very last thing is lips now
as you guys can see quite a few think
what we're going to do is we'll kind of
like number the drawers because I've got
six drawers here and then I've got seven
on top I've got glosses and I guess
we're just number the drawers you just a
number and then we've have to pick from
that draw yeah okay one two three four
five six five five was this one so guys
look at the colors in this drawer are
nice nice - I don't need to sneeze
sneeze I hate that you're one two three
four five we think in two rounds each
round or square round or square okay as
you can see for the lips it's pretty
bold see a warning we've got bold eyes
bold lips she's bought everything this
is the one that she picked it's actually
a really nice like purpley movie kind of
color the incredible Matt my day liquid
lip paint in fake it till I make it I
like the name is cute I've never
actually used these before my channel oh
I hope this guy's smells like alcohol
I'd like this is definitely gonna need
like two coats because the formulas
really liquidy and it's making it look a
little bit pudgy yes so you're much
better with two coats I'm not too sure
off the lip color actually goes is it
he's not too bad very last thing mom the
very very last thing is in this drawer I
don't hate you right yeah is a setting
spray which are all over back here kind
of hard to get out because yeah yeah
cool and then to finish up for setting
spray she picked B to face hangover 3 in
1 1 mmm smells so good it smells like
pina coladas huh lipstick IDs I'm pretty
sure less everything now yeah sorry
let's get them on back to see what she
thinks
