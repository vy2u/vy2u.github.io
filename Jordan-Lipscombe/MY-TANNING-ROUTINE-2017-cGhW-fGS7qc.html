down and filming my tanning routine for
you guys I know this is not overdue
sorry it took me this long I just really
wanted to make sure I nailed a routine
that I know works in that like I loved
before showing with you guys and I still
look at them that so just a little
background I can kind of probably like a
couple years so I saw I can say I've
tried my fair share or like products
different techniques basically tanning
disasters I mean looking back knock you
so I guess like a sale sort of got the
gist of it like I kind of know what I'm
doing I am by no means an expert I just
do our home it's like a hobby for me and
I guess I just like trial and error
themselves something good I will be
covering everything this video is kind
of like free stages for me so prep
tanning and maintaining so let's do this
fasting probably the most important is
prep now I feel like this is the most
important because it's kind of going to
determine that how your tan turns out
like the way it's going to look on your
skin it's kind of the skincare portion I
guess so I just jumped in the shower and
I'm going to exfoliate and shave
basically do everything to make my skin
like as soft as possible pretend to
exfoliate sighs now usually I'm
scrubbing off old tan because I'm time
very much 24/7 so I'm usually like in
the shower like like for real but
whether you have old time scrubbers or
not you should sit exfoliate because
it's good to get rid of that like top
layer of skin like the dead skin cells
so you've got like fresh skin but
somebody gross doing it but you know
what I mean when I exfoliate I like to
use these these are just exfoliant glad
seasons are from Primark and they're
like a pound for two honestly I don't
know what I would do without these I
don't use the scrub or anything I
literally just use these and I'll go
like crazy on my body I just scrub my
skin in the showers look as good five
minutes just to really make sure I've
you know got down dead skin cells or
from that like gross fix and now go in
and shave and not really like an expert
like when it comes to shaving alive or
it's a job have really stubborn hair
that grows back so quickly I get when I
shave I actually like to use conditioner
because it leaves my skin super super
soft but anyway that's sort of just like
the easy bit I guess um
one X then a when I'm out the show the
next thing I do is I wish to eyes now
this is actually so important kind up to
you where you want to look like this on
your skin so some people like to just
put it in the areas where like tan can
cling to like knees feet hands elbows
like the kind of dry places person
myself I just smell them I like entire
body in it but why'd you do that
doo doo I just like to leave my skin for
about 15-20 minutes before do anything
else just to really make sure this is
like sunk into my skin the good thing
about this though is like my skin
shrinks up it doesn't take long for it's
like to go into my skin which is good I
haven't even said what this enzyme this
is the cocoa butter moisturizer the best
moisturizers I've ever used
hands down this one in particular
fragrance for what it's a sensitive skin
so we can all use it that is pretty much
it for like the prep I think oh by the
way I like to do all of this routine at
night on such a night toner I like to
sleep in it I just find it way more
convenient for me obviously you can
totally do this in the morning leave
your tan to develop and wash off at
night that's cool but this is just how I
like to do a so I run out onto the best
part the sunny part so this is
personally what I love to use when I
turn nothing has ever ever beat there
sorry but how pros mime it looks it just
really happens my favorites hand I've
ever tried has to be borne by sands
honestly it's the nicest color like it
looks the most natural rock have been on
holiday kind of tan the pigment in it it
just sticks to my skin so I get a really
nice color payoff everything about it I
just love it
it's a color wise this one in particular
hasn't been out for that long but it's
my favorite this one is the ultra dark
and oh my god it is the best people say
do have other colors I'm pretty sure
they have a light to medium a dark and
this one so it is up to you if you are a
beginner I would recommend the light to
medium and then like build up if you
want to because you know just like if
you put this on its own you're gonna be
like Jesus it's like I said the color of
its really really nice it's got that all
is undertone this one is a fun one which
fine ones I feel like the most easy to
apply because they usually will
typically have a guide color basically
when you're applying it you can see
where the town is you can see if there's
places that you've missed and it's just
it's just get helpful smell wise okay
now it says I have a coconut so much I
kind of agree with that went and
developed anyway it naturally gets that
like weird Biscay smell
it kind of does that laughs I'm not
gonna lie so like I said I like to
sleeping it so it really doesn't affect
me at all you know I like to apply my
turn with admit I feel like kind of
generic everybody does that and I just
squirt a few pumps of this onto the mitt
and then I'll work it into my skin in
circular motions just you know I'm not
really afraid to apply this I like
squirt a good few pumps on each like
portion of my body but I like to be like
super tan so yeah just work in circular
motions all over my body now in the
cutaway I know it looks a little bit
crazier it's pre intense I know it might
look a little bit touchy as well but
don't worry that's literally just a
guy's color as long as there's like
darkness like a dark color everywhere in
your body to show that you've applied
everywhere honestly doesn't matter
because that will wash all no when it
comes to places like my hand I don't
apply like direct tan silhouette so what
I mean by that is as Han my entire arm
then whatever excess is on the mat I'll
go in and do my hand whether I have
buzzing sound to tan my hands is to have
your hand in a fist or like a claw shape
I know that's not really weird but doing
this you're allowing the cans again like
every single crease of your hand like
your knuckles and things because time to
be missed they're quite often then I'll
take them in and focus it right in
between each of my fingers and then I'll
go over the top of each finger that way
I get off see tan everywhere the reason
why I going with any more tan unlike my
hands on my feet is because they take to
turn way more and they go a lot darker
than the rest of your body so yeah this
is something a little bit extra but
honestly if you want like a seamless tan
try this out going with a makeup brush
this one's just an over one I'm pretty
sure this one is from eBay but any sort
of like fussing foundation brush will
work and I go in and bust out the places
where it's hand can cling to a lot more
so I wrists elbows hands feet knees I
think that's everything
so I just take the brush and just go in
circular motions on like those areas and
that's just going to buff up the tab
completely so there's minimal products
that if for some reason time tends to
build up so much easier in those places
and then get like the dark
pleasedon't bits and I'm like those are
just the waste I have found apply time
the best so if you do find that
sometimes your tallix touch you or
something then maybe try out those a few
different ways to apply it and it could
help you out also I like to take a baby
wipe when I finish and just wipe my
palms over just
there's no tunnel nurse maybe you know
sleeps for the met or something I don't
know but they're just I just do it in
case so you know once I have applied my
hand I'll leave my skin for like 10-15
minutes just to breathe because
obviously it can be quite tacky at first
and then I will just apply some loose
baggy clothing and head to that also I
apply a towel down on my bed and on my
pillow and then I am wearing these baggy
clothing because it will transfer I
think that's everything for telling ya
is the last part which is maintaining
your time this is probably the part
that's the most like to do but it makes
so much difference so I jump in the show
every day - like at least wash on my
body and when I do that I take the
exponent gloves again and I'll just
really really lightly pour over the top
of my skin just to exfoliate like this
smallest who is the mode I used to be so
scared to do this portion feels like I'm
going to scrub off my time but I promise
if you go and like like pressure and
just do it really really quickly it's
fine after times been on for a long time
it needs to be scrubbed off you kind of
look like a reptile like your skin goes
all weird like it goes alike you know
how I got it's so funny my boyfriend's
tagged me in this meme on Facebook the
other day it was look like a tiger oh if
you don't know what a tiger is just like
a bread roll I was like when your tan
starts coming off and you're just like
this is entire role literally body of
thing cause it's so true basically what
I'm trying to say is exposing gently
like that which is help to ease that and
not really let that happen pretty much
and then of course when I'm out the
shower I moisturize every single day to
keep my skin nice and hydrated that's
like a skin care portion on it which is
important because how nice your skin is
is how nice your tan looks on your skin
so make sense and then the main part
which is what keeps my tan looking so
strong and so like brand new
if stuff is a lifesaver it just helps
with the longevity of my tan so this is
the bondo Sam's
getting to the white what I've done this
is the liquid gold self tanning dry oil
now only pops by the way boyo I promise
your skin doesn't feel oily or anything
when you use it it's kind of just like a
water to be honest so I use this as what
I kind of call like a tan topper so
basically once your towns been on for
like three or so days and you're
starting to lose that little bit of
color you put this on a book your uncle
you look time to get inside the way this
has enough color in it that you could
literally just use this skipper
it looks bomb on its own but because I'm
extra and I like to be super super dark
i preside this as a tanto boss however
if you're beginner definitely stick to a
mousse because you can kind of see where
you're applying it it's just so much
easier whereas with this it doesn't have
a guide color so you do have to be like
saara when you're applying it for me you
notice the color in this like the next
day that's when it sort of shows through
our great thing about this guy's is you
can apply this it doesn't transfer so
you can put clothes on instantly and you
don't have to wash it off because the
colors that like you get from it is the
color that you get there's no guy color
there's nothing to wash off so how
good's that I thought this is a
convenience sake town like if you're a
busy person you know you've got places
to go people to see this is good for
that also to let you know how often I
like repeat this whole process um so if
I just use the mousse and don't really
use this as much I have to like change
my time pretty much like the seventh day
for sure that Stanton has to come off
and like be redone but if I use this as
a tan topper I can go from like a week
and after two weeks before us to repeat
the routine what if it just depends on
how lazy I am yeah basically every like
week week and a half I'll repeat this
process which might seem a little crazy
in a bit like much but honestly it just
it comes naturally to me now so that is
my turning routine vo if you guys I know
it probably seems quite excessive and
like I do a lot and it seems like a lot
of effort but I feel like it tanning now
for me interests like a hobby like I
love to do it and because I found it so
much it's just like easy for me to do
I'm quick at doing it the more you do it
the like easier it gets
