guys with a little bit of around the
video today I just really want to share
with you some of my favorite drugstore
makeup picks and I've kind of narrowed
it down to about 10 different things so
I have types of variant products as much
as possible here at foundation highlight
blush six of our it isn't everything for
like a full face or anything like that I
literally went into my drawers and was
like hey I love you I love you I love
you you're in the video delicious chomp
stream this is in no particular order
look at my game show for the fasting
L'Oreal True Match it was pre missing
the Milani one but I have to give it to
true man it sure about you guys I used
to hate the formula in the old bottle
like you used to melt off my face like
literally run away like run away once
this one is out to the coverage is
really nice kind of like a medium very
beautiful rule book read what very
vulnerable
the finish is lovely it's like that
starting the finish it's not matte not
cheery it's my on the jury side but it
looks like skin this is our formation at
when I wear everyone's always like what
is my real skin I'm like this little guy
I have a bunch and I mean a bunch of
shades so you are bound to slime on to
your skin I see you love it for
drugstore foundation I throw this
comparable to some of my lot higher end
ones I just I think stop keeping on with
skin products this is my next line so
this is called Jericho as you can see
I've used quite a bit had it a while and
I have no idea why I've not mentioned
this sooner
no no no so this actually comes under a
foundation but on it says makeup covers
you can use our foundation concealer
whatever you want basically this stuff
can cover anything and need thing I
chose that this can actually cover
tattoos I don't know how true that is
but now I'm given sister hour I'm going
to draw something on my hard with liner
and see if it covers them mister a
little of heart so I'm taking
honestly a really small amount let's see
all that I've covered that those and
that was one thin layer I'm sure if you
put one more on that would be gone I
personally love to use it of the
concealer because it covers great now it
is a paste so you might look at it and
be like that's going to look so taking
but I promise
you're getting start working in it
literally kind of melts it's really
strange obviously this isn't something
you can walk into super dragon just like
a pickup but I get mine from eBay and I
think it's about eight or nine pounds so
I mean hello that's even that's a lot oh
I also forgot to mention you need some
smallest amount like those are crazy
with this because Joe McCall is in my
top 10 we recommend this next thing is
hands down among favorite eyebrow
product ever if you ever wanted to know
what I use in my eyebrow all the time
you go this is the freedom eyebrow made
in soft brown it looks something like
this mine is disgusting like the bug is
wrecked
okay let's put that back on this for me
is by far the easiest thing for me to
use on my eyebrows personally like the
consistency of the pomade is really nice
because not too creamy not too hard it's
easy to work with pretty much got a nice
pigmentation to it honestly it reminds
me a lot of the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow pomade and it is a fraction of
the price I mean drugstore get in there
if they have a really nice color ranges
wearing a blonde brunette
like hair like anything might have this
one made I use it every single day
without fail just like that I think it's
five pounds as well like first in my
basket the full thing is this beauty
it's just a highlighting palette and
holy moly
is this good this is the makeup
revolution by the way make revolution is
one of my favorite drugstore and that
NYX I love this is the ultra pro glow
highlighting palette as you can see you
get eight different shades I mean just
the way that's like glowing you can
already tell these in any form so you
get a variety of different colors with
all sorts of complexions which is great
when you guys look at their can you kind
of see the Anastasia better here quick
in here because the formula of these
highlights blows my cut down line it
just feel so smooth but the pigmentation
is insane
there's no glitter in it there's a lot
like chunkiness or anything like that
just looks like wetness on the skin
wetness
Wow not so much it justit's like your
skin is wet you know like really glowy
read Yui I'm upset for the price and how
many you get and the quality of these
highlighters I would have to say this is
my favorite highlighting palette from
the drugstore I'm pretty sure this is
eight pounds and you get eight
highlighters so that's a pound a pop and
then copies of homes are are you serious
I thought you guys need to you about
some super drug and pick this up because
promise you won't regret it
so the first thing I officially have a
new favorite other guys so this is the
NYX epic ink liner in black and it's
waterproof it is literally a pen
eyeliner but what's so good about it is
it has it the finest tip ever I'm going
like typical YouTube star right now I
need an to stop row joke the first time
I use this I have never done my wings so
quick so easy without a mistake my wings
were like done and I was like excuse me
what what's going on this this never
happens so I use it the next day
and the same thing happened and it was
this Iona only look it's nice and black
it is waterproof but this stuff does not
budge like my eye was written streaming
like no proposals coming out of my
eyeball and it just stayed on but if you
go if you struggle with your winged
eyeliner or just shot eyeliner in
general please give this a go because
that it will change your life that's
what you do it was saying oh Jesus Who
am I sighs and Cory sent me this about a
week ago on saying Adaro is you guys
okay don't tell me you I'm thinking
about this so thank you for that but
this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory peach party
multicolor plush brick that's a mouthful
this is Emmet Lee color apricot jam or
so risk it the will with four different
colors in so there's like a bronze a
champagne a pink and a gold I'd actually
just swirl them all together and apply
it to my cheeks and not only does this
give you like that really nice kind of
peachy gold flush of color this leaves
my skin glow wing like blind a bitch
like hi I'm here you're sorry pretty
it's like a blush and highlight in one I
just why I'm not used using our I have
no idea I do
have the other honors today which is for
my skin so like glory if you are - tabs
and all you love your highlight or you
just want something to make your skin
look a little bit more like pick this up
I felt like this is an underdog product
in the drugstore so many people talking
about it
so seventh is eyeshadow - these are the
next pretty much eyes shadows now first
of all the packaging is adorable but I
mean what's inside even though they have
a bunch of colors they have like
neutrals pops of colors not gonna lie
these are present actually some of my
higher-end eyeshadows as soon as those
watch one of these I was like the
formula and pigmentation of these he is
incredible like these ones are for my
favorite so the first one is called
voodoo which is that like brownie greeny
bluey reflex like come on now this one
is called rose dust which is literally
just like of rose gold or these are so
smooth like you need to fill these this
one is called sunset days which is
literally just a couple like oh my god
literally then this one is called a doll
face which is just a pink this one is a
little bit more busy in formula but it's
still it still some what it little
closer to supers can see but look how
insane they are these are five pound
each but honestly so worth it for the
quality feel like you need these in your
life so number eight is a powder bloody
a lot the bigan so this is the coat es
bonnet loose face powder I have mine Amy
translucent extra coverage oh no they
just are translucent and a color and
stuff but the extra coverage translucent
is my favorite
yeah is literally Oh smell is a little
bit funky kind of smells like what you
would imagine in this like you know
house just not nothing that's a bad
thing but a little bit of Imperial
leather in there it's a really nice
power to bake with to set your entire
face like an all-round good powder it's
slicing like finely milled that leaves
your skin like feeling soft looking soft
just dissolves there's no color of a
secret translucent so I'd be good for a
variety of skin tones so I give my from
Amber's
I think it's about 10 12 pounds which
for a few shove I'm so good if you are
on the hunt for a good powder and you've
not yet tried this one give it home so
the nice thing I have and lip liner for
you well lip line is they're just like
the same brand these are the MUA intense
color lip liners these are wireless
pound like just one not two not three
one so now if you know me you know I
love a nude lip and the drugstore kill
it with the nude lips in my opinion and
I have the colors caramel nugget and
deserts are now caramel nugget is when I
want more like a brownies nude lips it
just looks like that
and then this one is desert sand so this
is when I want more of like a pinky nude
they're nice and creamy really easy to
apply like just kind of glide on really
help like lipstick to last and Serena's
guide for any nude lipstick to be less
of a seat depending on what kind of
color will also blows my mind is the lid
in the sharpener so now you do get a lip
liner you get a sharp two as well like
how cool is that anyway to not mess
around I think you love a nude lip like
me and want some nice lip liners too
much chatter anyway my tempting you guys
is of course lipsticks now this wouldn't
be my top ten without including the NYX
lip lingerie liquid lipsticks like I
love these color range of this lipstick
wishes like it was made for me cause
they're a liquid lipstick they dry down
Matt they last a really long time on my
lips
they are quite drying it's not like
uncomfortable drying but like now there
was that noise like oh so one of my
favorite colors is co sharp which is
just this newly pinky Brown so pretty as
you also love something ribbon as well
by selective shop is an all-round good
colors like everybody and then I'm going
to sneak this one in as well because it
is next to it I'm going to like say it's
the same thing I love me a nude muted
like watering right now yes this is a
baby version but this is the NYX soft
matte lip cream in Cairo this one is
more like teaching nude so I wanted to
show this one because if you are into
liquid lipsticks or you find this form
a little bit too drawing or whatever the
soft matte lip creams are a great
alternative similar formula I got that
kind of messy souffle thing going on so
super opaque they're way more
comfortable they're not like budge proof
like a liquid lipstick like they will
transfer but they are a bit more
comfortable so if that is my top ten
drugstore makeup
picks I seriously think you guys need in
your life you honestly is don't need to
spend a fortune to find good makeup and
guys this is one here for I'm here to
test things out for you guys you don't
have to and just tell you what's good
what's not naked you didn't notice
videos to get to it smash it that thumbs
up button and if you are subscribed
already please do because I really want
you here thank you so so much for taking
the time to watch this video I love you
guys and I will see you all in my next
video
