answers video I have not yet done one of
these on my channel and I think it's
about time so I am so so excited so I
asked you guys to ask me questions on my
YouTube my snapchat and my Instagram so
I'm just kind of kind of going in
between your social media pick out a few
and answer them for you guys so let's do
this how old are you I am 18 my
birthday's in March so yeah who or what
inspired you to become a youtuber love
your videos thank you um I think it was
more kind of what inspired me I guess I
probably have a similar answer to most
people but um I guess I just watch
youtube videos all the time and I love
watching them and it just makes me happy
and I'm a huge believer in doing what
makes you happy because otherwise what's
the point
um so I thought I'm going to do YouTube
and post a video and honestly it was the
best decision that I've ever made in my
life
I guess just watching other youtubers
and having a huge passion for makeup and
beauty in the first place inspired me a
lot and also I thought my family and
friends did as well because I've always
wanted to make a youtube and they were
like just do it how often do you post
new videos watch all of them now and
just one more um
so I aim to post at least once a week
but honestly I do want to up my game a
little bit and start posting a little
bit more regularly because I'll put my
hands up I'm guilty of maybe posting a
video at the beginning of one week and
the next I'll post at the end so
technically that's longer than a week
sorry yeah I did also get off if YouTube
is my full-time job and it's not I do
have a full-time job as well as doing
YouTube so I'm kind of at the moment
juggling both but I do want to start
prioritizing with my youtube and really
kind of like going at it because I know
that's what you guys want you have any
guests anytime soon I guess you might
mean like collaborations at the moment I
don't have anything coming up soon but
stuff doesn't mean there isn't going to
be any I'm always open to collaborating
with other youtubers because I just
think that's so much fun and making a
new friend would be amazing so maybe
don't give anything away but maybe if
you do any fitness schedules or certain
exercises I wish I don't really do
anything I'll be missed which is really
bad I used to go to the gym haven't been
in ages I don't even remember the last
time we went oops I sometimes do
exercises in my room I don't have a
routine unfortunately I'll be honest
what is your favorite lip product oh
it's just too many probably I won't do
anything I can choose a product but I
will probably say I have a favorite
color that's like my go-to and it's kind
of like those pinky movie colors like a
Mac so it's hey Kat Von D bow and arrow
Rimmel zero eight lipstick like all of
them at kind of nudie colors what is
your favorite drugstore highlights are
that's a good question because I don't
think there are many good drugstore
highlighters out there and I would
probably have to say the sleek solstice
highlighting palette or color pop spoon
highlighter I'm wearing that today and
it's amazing they're the ones that sort
of popped my head straight away so I'd
probably have to say them you could move
to any country where would you go I
would probably have to say I love for
bra or the Maldives like they're like my
dream but I feel like I'm also thinking
maybe somewhere in America I don't know
where but just somewhere where there's
like a Sephora and like a billion places
to buy makeup I think I speak for all of
us here in the UK when I say we are so
limited to the amount of makeup we have
compared to America we have like nothing
you Americans don't realize how lucky
you are that's what I'm saying hands up
if you think there should be a Sephora
here in the UK so for us you're not even
watching this but like please come to
the UK do these next few questions are
going to be about my hair I have to say
that I have questions where the most
popular by far on any of my videos so
I'm it going to get to answering them
for you guys because I know everyone's
dying to know so somebody else what my
favorite shampoo and conditioner is so I
have to say the Elle
extraordinary clay ones are by far my
favorite they are made for oily roots
and dry ends which is literally exactly
my hair type so is there anything in
particular I do to keep my hair healthy
I make sure that I don't wash my hair
every single day now I used to be
someone who had to wash their hair every
single day because my hair got so greasy
I hated the feel of my hair feeling
dirty but honestly now I wash it every
other day or every three days and I've
noticed a huge difference in the
condition of my hair I have to include
this oil this is the best oil I've ever
used it kind of looks like I've hardly
use anything but every time I wash my
hair I use this and it saved my hair
this is the John Frieda Frizz Ease
nourishing oil elixir this stuff is
incredible so once I've sort of like
towel dried my hair so I make sure that
is damp because if I has soaking wet it
kind of dilutes the product so once my
heads damp I just flip over put a few
pumps of this into my hand and run it
through my hair until there's no like oh
you're left on my hands and that's how I
apply this and it makes my hair feel so
smooth I honestly have the most knotty
hair like my hair so tangley all the
time especially like underneath here
leaves my hair feeling really soft and
manageable so this is a favorite oil of
mine
everyone in my family uses this because
it's so good and then also my tangle
teezer which is like gross because
there's so much hair in it
whoo but my best friend when it comes to
brushing my hair I used to hate brushing
my hair because there were so many knots
and used to have but this just gently
close for my hair gets all of the knots
out doesn't pull out my scalp or doesn't
kind of like damage my ends you know
like rip out the knots this is just
amazing so if you haven't invested in
one of these and you struggle with
knotty hair definitely get one because
game changer when it comes to brushing
your hair so just so you guys know my
sister did do my hair and she is a
professional and qualified hairdresser
so any terms I'm about to give you you
might be like what does that even mean
but if you just say them to your
hairdresser they will completely
understand there is no other way really
that I can tell you what is the what is
my haircut I asked her and she said
basically it is soft layers with shaping
around the front you can see that like I
do have some layers
up there like not far off of each other
at all so they're just sophomore towards
the bottom and then of course I've got
like a bit of shape around my face so
that is littering my hair kites so
simple
what is your hair color so many people
asked about my hair color and basically
I have a four head of clothes highlights
so I basically have like a billion
highlights in it how that's done and the
toner and every day that and bleach and
a31
oxidant cream was mixed together and
then of course applied to my head in the
form of clothes highlights a full head
of them toner that was used in my hair
so what got this color was 7.14 die rich
s if you say that to your hair dress I'm
sure they will know what you mean but
that is the color of my toner so I could
color at my scalp is what my natural
hair color is so all the highlights were
pretty much put on my natural hair color
just a quick thing that I picked up on
some of you said in my hair video that
the highlights have bled at the back
that's completely gone now it's just
where they were like freshly applied
after a few washes that complete you I
have any couple video ones from snapchat
so I'm just going to quickly answer
those your psyche and I well one of my
dreams to be honest is to go traveling
just to travel the world I may want to
do a road trip in America I want to go
to Paris I just want to travel the world
I honestly do so anywhere and everywhere
I'm looking at like my makeup trying to
like see something I feel like to meet
base makeup is a huge huge thing so I'd
probably go for maybe like a concealer
or highlighter honestly don't know how
to answer that question because I don't
even know myself I just feel so lucky
and so blessed to have the best
subscribers the best viewers and the
most amazing support from all
you I'm just so so grateful I feel like
if anything that questions to go out to
you guys because you guys are the ones
that watch my videos and enjoy them so I
feel like you guys know the answer to
that favorite youtubers I have so many
but I guess ones that just kind of come
to mind would be Shawnee Grimm and Jamie
Genevieve
Amanda anything Nicole Guerrero I hope I
didn't bitch her name soft as nails
Emily Canon Hanna Renee
Patricia Bry I have so many more than
that but they're just like a few I guess
that instantly come to mind what's the
craziest thing you've ever done
uh I would say I am still yet to do it
I'm only 18 so I'm still yet to do it
what's handy is um I go between two I
guess I go between bondo sands moves in
dark and the summer it's moose the five
in one tan in dark it's like their new
one at the moment I have been using this
Emirates one I am dying to try the
loving tan mousse I think that looks
amazing as well so I want to become a
youtuber and I was wondering what tips
you have to have it actually grow into a
career slash successful channel that's a
good question and I would have to say
make sure that you're true to yourself
stay true to who you are be yourself
don't try to be anybody else because
people will see through that like your
own personality shine through because
people love to watch you for you they
don't want to watch you and think of
anybody else another thing I would say
is make sure that you're doing YouTube
for the right reasons it sounds silly
but don't be in it for money or or what
you can get from YouTube on you if I
done YouTube and I made a difference to
one person that's that's all I need and
of course like make sure like if you
post a video you put it on your social
media to let your viewers know that
you've posted a video and just keep
consistent so I think that's all the
questions I'm going to answer today
otherwise we will be here forever if you
enjoyed the video please give it a big
thumbs up and if you could subscribe
that would be amazing thank you all so
much for watching I love you guys and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
