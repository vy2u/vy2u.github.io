today with a little bit of fur get ready
with me do my makeup and also this hair
is oh right ok so before we get started
I want to share with you guys this
fashion app that I have been freaking
obsessed with I'm actually working with
them on this part of the video which is
so exciting and I thought while I'm
showing you an outfit I may as well tell
you all about it basically I have been
listening to you guys I've been
scrolling through all of my youtube
comments and the comments on my
Instagram photos and I've been seeing
that you find it hard to actually find
the items of clothing that I'm wearing
what Instagram I can type the brand you
can see where it's from I can't give you
guys direct links sometimes which is
really annoying
about this app that I'm about to show
you Saul Saul why it is called 21 bands
so this is the app here and then here is
my little profile so if I scroll down
you can see a few outfit pictures that I
have posted some of them you might
recognize from my Instagram but there is
a cheeky little one on there that I
haven't posted yet so you go check it
out but if you click on a picture I've
actually saw all these dots on the photo
and if you click on one it actually
shows you a link where you can go and
get the item so you can actually click
on a photo so you like the jumper dress
they're wearing the little pink circle
I've linked up there so click on that
door
as you can see it shows you the item at
the prize where you can get it click
down here to click buy on web and as you
can see it takes you straight to the top
of dress like house up is that a third
of you guys actually searching for hours
trying to find this bit of clothing you
can let you do it on here and of course
this outfit will be on there so check
that out I mean if you have ever been
interested in the clothes that I wear
make sure you follow me on 21 buttons I
will leave my profile right here it is
just Jordan it's gonna be yeah check out
21 buttons it is literally made the
search in life so much easier
but yeah without further ado I'm gonna
get into this little shoddy get ready
with me I hope you guys enjoy and let's
go okay so let's put my face on I was
actually thinking about maybe doing
something you know with a little bit
color they were more creative but then
keeping it real but I really use color
on a night out or what I kind of stick
to what I know you feel me
I don't we know I'm doing to be honest I
mean typically on a night out I love to
do a smoky I think it goes with like
thing I'm just feeling something intense
and just like BAM let's do this just
gonna start by you know getting out the
way I'm gonna do my eyes fast because
I'm planning on using like Browns and
blacks and girl I can already see that
photo oh yeah also obviously this is a
get ready with me rather than a tutorial
sorry I just hit myself yeah I just like
bear with me if I forget to say
something as a button I will of course
leave everything linked in the
description box got you back just gonna
set this in place with some translucent
powder or why me thanks so quick I'm
like I'm Way okay
I literally just caught a glimpse of
myself in the viewfinder like that
that's not key right so I shadow I was
actually gonna use the a BH subculture
palette the most controversial freakin
eyeshadow palette the colors are so fab
I just don't think that what I had in
mind for this video so come back to this
little guy in another video but this
eyeshadow palette Oh like this bottom
row that is a smokey eye alright is the
M decay naked ultimate basics palette
like I love this little guy
on a smooth these issues never let me
don't think I'm just gonna mix these two
together for you know that transition
blend these into the crease Oh guys I
can already tell this makeup look it's
gonna be in our makeup you're just gonna
need to keep blending so I mean I could
oh look at that pigment Oh blimey I do
kind of have a vision of how I want this
to look but I mean this is me so I could
FL you know what we think positive I can
do this we got this we got this oh yeah
also don't wear the fact that I like to
my eyeshadow like all the way down here
like to Germany I just prefer it because
I get to like just match the edge I'm
not gonna take a dark brown Kohl pencil
this one's a law in London one this is
the part boys and girls we've gotta be
brave you've gotta be brave because I'm
basically gonna be coloring in my lid
with this pencil only thing I will say
is just make sure your pencil is like
blender ball otherwise you're gonna be
in a sticky situation
literally I need my sharpener like this
look at that look at that up stump and
there goes my eyeshadow palette oh my
god off all that search and it was
literally on top Wow
okay so now that looks really messy
right now but I'll fix it I'm gonna take
the brown in the black and just set that
in place and then start buffing the
color out let's just do the action like
I know I'm just gonna start buffing I do
little circles and then I go like back
and forth little circles back and forth
I think that's the easiest way to then
now all right I think I can move on to
the other by now do we think I'm trying
to think if there's anything to like
tell you guys but honestly I'm kind of
boring actually no I've got some pretty
exciting things coming out some of it I
can't really like talk about actually
you know what I just want to say to you
guys thank you so much for all your love
and support it literally blows my mind
it's so much like I just can to think as
well how much I've grown as a person
since doing YouTube like if you look
back at my first video I mean don't do
that because it's gross but the fact
that you guys have even like allowed me
to do this and then have supported me
throughout the whole journey like to
think how I used to feel and where I've
come from and where I am now okay I
can't talk about it too much because I
will get emotional but yeah I just
wanted to take the opportunity to thank
you guys so so much okay back to the
makeup bloody yeah that went from zero
to deep or real quick anyway she was
clean up these bitches and then any
fallout is so frickin satisfying I think
it is time to put on some lashes these
iconic ones at the moment have been at
my faith in the style fear so you know
I'm about to put these on my eyeball I'm
just like where's everyone then so man
buy a little bit of mascara
that was a close one genuinely just
nearly poked my entire eyeball out of
its socket jewelry lash glue I literally
think I say this in every video but this
is the best like obviously it's just the
best
why does eyelash glue always smell like
fish cause somebody tell me well you
know what I'm gonna stick on these
lashes and then I'll be back right girls
back and the lashes are on good at
primary skin now with the professional
and Matt's rescue primer well it sure
looks like toothpaste but it does the
job nicely so now that my face is
feeling nice and tacky I really really
want to try out this Kiko foundation
this is part of their full collection
this is new it's in this cute little
glass jar okay that looks like it's
gonna be beautiful on the skin this is
the color 0-3 warm beige I think it
might be a little bit too light but I'll
make it work
just gonna put a little bit here mmm
so it's definitely gonna be a little bit
too light what to do what to do you know
what I think I'm gonna add some of my
makeup for our foundation stick but
first I'm just gonna blend this out on
its own to see what the foundations
actually like all right oh that is so
nice - the shade that looks so nice on
the skin I definitely need this in a
darker color but I'm gonna do the rest
of my face now this sponge as well by
the way is the body shop one and at
first I was like god dang that's hard
like it's not a soft as a Beautyblender
bar credit where credit's do this is
blending up my foundation mind the brow
see this is the only thing about new
eyebrows before concealer is the Make Up
For Ever HD one my color by the way is
in y31 I've seen some of you a skin so
yeah why don't work like a hair with the
concealer like I'm not shy
oh yes like how perfect does that point
of the sponge fit in there
Kanoe is set underneath my eyes with the
Too Faced Born This Way loose powder
you know what let's do a bit of a Kitsch
let's do some bacon I kind of like to
bake on a night out because I think it
actually helps with controlling my oils
a little bit because I am an oily mess
let me tell you and then just set the
rest of my face while the powder is just
doing its thing I'm gonna put on a bit
benefit who know I haven't used this
little guy in so freakin long so for why
not it's whipping out I normally use my
makeup for everyone or my body shop one
and then just where I use them so much
honestly I forget I have other bronzes
lips my Baker can just come off now
see ya should I put on a blush yeah this
is infatuation from makeup geek I just
feel like it's kind of neutral so it
won't be too much yeah just a little
something-something highlight I'm
actually gonna use the Primark PS bronze
highlight and glow poly I'm gonna mix
this one and this one this palette is
four pounds and Primark man
they did this they did this Mike I'm
sorry but four pounds give me 20 right
you finish up underneath our eyes I'm
gonna take that same a.m. 2 p.m.
pencil that we use on our ice pop it
into my water I know if any losses in
the water line but holy crap can you see
that
bellick she just glided on but in London
this Ames Pam pants were so good people
get him down this right here I honestly
thought christina was in the room then I
sounded just like her can I even keep
that in I don't even know YouTube might
copyright me okay I'm just gonna like
mix all three colors orange brown black
just do a little combo just gonna create
some smokiness up in here
I'm actually gonna bring it down kind of
low down low no no cool man gonna add a
little touch of mascara
so for lips I actually really want to
try out one of these hourglass lipsticks
so these are their new ones they're
meant to be refillable lipsticks so this
here is meant to be like the actual
lipstick holder and then these are the
colors that you put into here I've never
done this so let's just hope I don't
break something
so that just comes off and there and I
think I'm gonna go for this color here
is a nude and it's called I wish because
I wish I knew break anything I guess you
just pop that off and then just click
this into there and you have your limpy
that is so freakin cool oh just gonna
line my lips first right let's get this
a little go that guy is so freaking
pretty these are just like gliding on
can you see this I'm just gonna take
some of my body shot instrument over the
top just to make it completely about
then to finish up a little bit of my
two-faced hang up a three and one
setting spray and primer oh let that dry
coz my face right now is literally wet
right so my makeup is done I now just
need to do something with my head even
just like curl my hair or I will just
straighten it and have it in some sort
of exceed care style so I'm gonna
straighten it quickly of my chickadees
and then I'll show you guys the
hairstyle that I'm gonna go for right so
I am it back and my hair is actually
straight I didn't show you guys me
straightening my hair cause I feel like
that would be kind of tedious to watch
it but for the hairstyle I think I'm
gonna do like a low sleek bun kind of
situation with a middle part I'm just
gonna tuck this behind my ears brush add
some hairspray gonna smooth down a
little baby kiss I have so many little
flyaways I'm just saying get down then
I'm just gonna gather all my hair out
the back and put it in a little pony
and for the bun I'm just going to let
you twist the ponytail and then just
start wrapping it around into a little
bun and then we're basically you just
canoe a bobby pin and the absolute crap
out of it and then I just like to go in
and just pull out it slightly to make it
a little bit bigger
you don't obviously after this I just
like my banner to be big this is it yeah
it's how I do the little low button so
it that is it for this casual just like
