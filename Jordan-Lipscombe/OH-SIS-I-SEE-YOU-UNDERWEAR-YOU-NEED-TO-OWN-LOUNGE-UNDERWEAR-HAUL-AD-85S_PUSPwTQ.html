at it again it with another YouTube
video I am so excited for today's video
guys like NYX I'm gonna say real because
it is another video to join a little
like longer a series that we have going
on over here
which real quick if you are new around
here and you've never seen my face
before I have actually filmed two other
lingerie videos before on my channel so
I mean if you do want to check them out
I will leave them links below
but yeah today's video is an exciting
one because it is with a brand that I
have had my eye on for the longest time
longest time let me tell you that brand
is lounge underwear I am so sure that
you've heard of them they're like all
over Instagram like they're a thing they
are a big thing so yeah I'm working with
lounge on this video so thank you so so
much for wanting to work with me like as
soon as they hit me up and was like hey
Jules like do you want to do a video
together I was like yes no but for
although I was so down because I wanted
to try this stuff at ages my friend
actually has an underwear set from them
and it's so bomb like she looks so good
in there trust me
guy is like I would not be showing this
with you if I didn't think it was fab
like I'm not about that you all know I'm
not gonna sit here and lick ass just for
the sake of getting a few coins in my
bank account that's not how I work and
you know that's just not how all my
youtube channel to be this is my honest
review and all the opinions are hundreds
every oh sorry I let you just could not
say no like hello and I feel like you
guys are gonna love them as well no you
guys know I always say I love myself
some affordable underwear because you
know we've gotta wear underwear on the
daily and keeping it real here we don't
have 80 pounds pair 4 and underwear set
like every single pair like however I do
always say you should have them luxury
pieces that you know you wear for them
special occasions
all you just wear it to make yourself
feel good I feel like we all deserve a
underwear pair that's probably a little
bit more expensive but it's like a
luxury to have and when you have it you
really appreciate it the reason why I'm
saying this is because lounge is a
little bit more on the pricier side but
it is so worth it ok I will include
pictures of models by the way I
personally won't be trying them on
because I've got to keep my modesty on
the tube ok I think we should just like
jump into the hall let's do it here is
the bag full of goodies
I'm ready to dive in oh okay Jordan Wow
it's literally been like a minute into
the video and you already grow some
people outside your smile
this is the bag that it all comes in by
the way and can feel like a sucker for
packaging like me and you want to know I
have some bits here as well which look
at how cute these are they obviously
come in different sizes as well I feel
so like mean I'm wrapping it you know
it's just so pretty in your life I don't
do it look it's my birthday and
everything comes in its own your bags
I'm like dead I'm oh my god I'm getting
excited with the packaging guys like
who's with me
forgot to say the box is they actually
have like a gift wrap service so if
you're giving this as a gift boy is if
there's any of you boys watching this
was actually make the most perfect gift
it's five pounds extra which this is
like a keepsake man like how cute would
that look at the background Wow it's
achieved you if you don't want the gift
box so this if you like standard
packaging that the underwear comes in
like these little bags first set I have
to show you okay this is like this is
like a cheeky little number just so you
know their lounge do have like a ton of
different underwear options that you
have the more sort of casual in but like
you still look bomber
as you know well they have things like
this which so this is a little black
lace bra it is like lace like you can
see a little bit knit through there okay
the cups are under wide and then it has
this like elasticated um band thing
great explanation and it says lounge
which I love and then the underwear
looks like this the same survival asta
cated lounge bit is a thong and guys if
you have seen my past lingerie videos
you will know how much I love a
triangle-shaped underwear like thong
basically the ones that look more
high-rise and you can kind of pull up
and put at your hips and I just think it
looks so flowering well lounge ice well
it she specializes in that okay like
this underwear is so flattering you guys
will be shocked okay like I just I'm
obsessed I love how it's black I think
like is so sexy it just looks so kind of
like sophisticated but like you know
we've got lace and everything on show so
it's I honestly feel like everyone needs
a bit of black lace in your life like
you can't go wrong what I'm gonna do
right now I'm gonna put my size is that
I am on like the boobie area
bohm area just so when I tell you the
sizes I got you can kind of get like a
feeling stuff this does come as a set
but the sad thing is is you can choose
like different sizes I've got a to be in
the top and a small in the thongs and
price-wise like I said they are a little
bit pricier it's fifty pounds which some
of you might be like but let me tell you
feeling good and confident and sexy
about yourself is so worth the splurge
so I'd recommend okay right this one I
feel like you guys are gonna love just
as much as me do you know what I mean
how pretty is this first of all hello
it's like a ready pink satin as well we
all know how I feel about satin it just
looks so like luxury do not I mean
balcony bra type situation there's no
like padding in it by the way but you
know we're over here embracing they
debated City so it's fun and then here
are these thongs like I said that solve
high-rise triangle shaped song right up
my street elastic headband as well so
it's super comfortable that's what the
back looks like I just realized I'm
legit joking
I'm just obsessed with the color I think
it is so pretty it's so feminine it did
also come in a few other colors as well
I know there's like a champagne e pink
which is gorge again this comes as I
said I got I set it to be and also a
small in the bottoms
I'm not gonna lie though this style like
the balcony briar always feel like comes
up a lot smaller so I probably should
have got a see what I mean they're like
fitting in there but just be wary of
that that this style on their website
does come up a little bit smaller now on
the website is telling me that this is
only 55 pounds bar
it's very v at the moment we love a
bargain queen but yeah if you can get
your hands on that little guy do it next
up I feel like lounge is known for this
underwear this style is the one that I'm
sure you've all seen like though the
Instagram is the classic triangle shapes
kind of cotton lounge comfy as hell
underwear yeah it's like I said it's
like a cotton material no padding or
anything so like that is comfy the back
as well is really really cute has like a
cult bit can you guys see what I mean
like here just so you know you can't
adjust a zone like Clippy thingies there
but it is elastic it's just really
stretchy so it still fits fab and then
the thong looks like this you can see
that now I love the thick band how cool
is that of course these are another pair
that you can pull up of the hips like
this create that shape first of all I
have to get the red I'm obsessed with
this or pillar box red color red I says
well I'm a red looks so good on all skin
tones is fits like a glove
I put it on and I showed my mom and she
said literally this is such a good like
way of putting it she said it looked
like it was made to fit me do you know
what I mean my stomach fits so well that
you literally like it was made for me it
comes as a set of course and because
this is not like an actual cut like it's
not a bra car a lot of places will do
this they'll do it in like a small
medium large so I got a small in both
and this is 40 pounds which i think is
so good considering some of the ones out
there on the market already that I like
what like like no tea no shade but
having fines you pay like 40 pounds for
just the bra I don't wanna be that girl
but I just do think this is better
quality for the money do calvin's have
this elasticated waist band
hell no do they have this is like proper
stitched in some of the cover and
underwear for like the Ryan's gonna rub
off this is like a really thick cotton I
just think for the price yeah this is
good I love to that design so much that
I had to get the wire as well the exact
same thing as you can see and then my
Christmas forearms look like this so
yeah exactly the same vibe I'm obsessed
with that the black and why I think it's
so sleek why black such classic quote
cool colors I got them both in a small
and again it's 40 pounds - I am gonna
live in these and I want them in like
every single gallon out this is just so
comfy like obsessed now the last pieces
that I have to share you underwear wise
I feel so posh with everything wrapped
these are actually gonna be a little
exclusive because these haven't even
launched yet they will be launching on
the 27th of April 2018 so what I seen
like a couple weeks see you guys
a little sneak peak a little insight
into what's coming now if you love these
I'm sorry I'm literally like teasing you
but guys I promise in like a couple
weeks they'll be there they'll be
waiting for you this color we all know I
love a good nude look at this right so
holding up honestly is doing it no
justice it was half mesh half material
so you've got like half boob mesh half
noids
it's cool and then the back has the same
sort of effect as the other underwear it
kind of like dips down if you can see
that right I appreciate detail okay so
the lounge let me show you is actually
embossed into it so that is never ever
going to come off and then on the straps
as well it says lounge too how insane is
that thongs have the same kind of vibe
so again that triangle-shaped thumb
little mesh panel here material to cover
the vajayjay and then the whole back is
mesh as well I love this nude color so
much it's like a brown nude so it's
gonna look good on all skin tones I feel
like they're a hybrid between the sort
of comfy couch and then the soft more
sexy luxury ones it's got like the
sexiness because of the mesh and stuff
but then it's that sort of comfy
material I can't even explain the
material is that thin but really really
really soft I got a small in both and
price-wise I actually don't know off the
top of my head how much these are gonna
be but why we'll do ask me to lounge and
find out for you and ride it on the
screen so you know you have that info I
loved it that much that I have it in the
black as well how nice is the black is
in the exact same style but black so it
has that same mesh panel and everything
underwear looks like this as well I
really love the black I didn't say with
the last one but guys don't be fought
off by the fact this looks quite Vegas
actually not what if I sawed up I looked
in I was like oh I've got B boobs not
the Woody's it's weird it just looks big
off it fits fine I've got them both in a
small as well by the way that mesh it as
well I know it's gonna be coming like a
kawaii bluey color and also white so
look out for them have to finish off not
only do lounge do a crap ton of
underwear they also do loungewear like
lounge lounge where like literally comfy
lounge where I got a jogger said I was
gonna get a legging set as well to be
able to show you guys because it looks
so so nice I like
piracy leggins and like a brawler but
black the color I wanted was out of
stock and I weren't really feeling any
of the other colors at the time like
they're just not really me right off the
bat
okay these are so thick and like these
knees basically gonna keep you so home
so fill up my mom when she does the
washing here they are so these are black
joggers as you can see they go all the
way down they have cuffed bottoms which
I really would like to say give you that
shape they have pockets winner winner
chicken dinner
they have lounge printed on here and
this isn't like a rubberized material
drawstring waist so we can suck
everything in get that hip shape coming
on and then the detail that I'm sure you
will appreciate as well they have kind
of this like you know what boys have
like their books to show in that's what
this reminds me of which i think is so
cool it's such a cool detail these are
so cool do you know what I mean
these by the way as well the fit they're
like a skinny joggers are still super
super flattering on the bum and staff
but most importantly they are super
super comfy like I'm all about being
comfy also they're like fleece inside
the softest thing ever
one little thing I wish was different
about these is I wish they were like
high-waisted so they kind of come in
line with your belly button I just wish
they were like I love a good
high-waisted iron my joggers are in a
size small and these are 55 pounds you
can feel that they they totally are
worth that and then for the top you can
actually get like a cute little t-shirt
or like this like what I asked for I got
the floor cropped hoodie so of course
you have the hood with the littles or
drawstrings long sleeved lounge is on
the front and again that rubberized
material I love how they saw spaced out
lounge I think that looks really cool
and then it is a crop it is a long crop
though which I'm not gonna lie that's
not usually my style but to pair with
these I really appreciate it because
then you've not got too much skin in the
middle on show it kind of all is even
and guess what bootie
it's fleecy as well I got the hoodie in
a small and the hoodie is the den it's
50 pounds so yeah you can have like a
cute little matching set if you don't
own a comfy matching set like this in
your life please do like it will be able
to change everything for you because not
only can you chill in these and lounge
in them lounge lounge or a pot in the
pond but you can legit go out on these
as
like actual clothes so good and then
very very lastly we have the exact same
set but it is in this George light gray
color here they are here you can
actually see these better than the black
on camera I feel like little like boxes
style top drawstrings lounge pockets all
the way down to the cuffs of course like
all fleecy and soft in the ivory I want
to put these on right now can I just
like Thanks exactly the same as the last
one it's so small and 55 and then we
have the hoodie here as well it was
pretty big on camera I promise it's not
like it fits really well
why is everything looking huge in there
it's like why does that look so big
ma'am I promise it's not what am i doing
a look like a gopher like I'm going to
go and again a small and yeah 50 pounds
I literally want to put this on right
now so like BRB and that concludes this
little hole that is literally everything
so what do you guys think of the pieces
I'm obsessed they have so much variety
and just so many like options and it
covers like everyone so even if you're
not really into underwear you can still
get clothes and vice versa girls and
boys like I do just want to say spending
that little bit extra on something that
is gonna make you feel so empowered and
just so good about yourself and so
confident is so worth it I know it
sounds really extra on OTT / underwear
can genuinely make you feel like that
but the quality matches up that's the
most important thing there's no
preparing a hefty price tag on something
if the quality is like crap but lounge
quality meets price and yeah you get
what you pay for like completely so yeah
that is everything from me I really
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
