yes he's bought more clothes hey girls
and boys it's Jordan Buckley again with
another youtube video and we have
another video in our clothing will
another video for a little testing one
brand clothing series if you guys are
new to these series which I'm sure
you're not because we all do it on
YouTube it's like a little thing that
goes around here but just in case you
haven't seen one before or if you
haven't seen it from me basically what I
do is buy buy a bunch of clothes from
one clothing brand and we test them out
we find out whether it is worth spending
your dollar on and also in the ones that
I do i style the items because I don't
know how you guys silent can be a pain
in the ass like knowing what to pair
with what can be like a freaking like to
ask so if I like them I'll star them up
give you guys a lot of it in spoke my
kind of style I guess I have done a few
of these before I've done boohoo and
misguided I will leave them link below
if you want to check out after this
video but today's brand ladies and gents
is that was like my attempt at drumroll
it's gonna be the one and only pretty
little thing no I feel like we all know
prayer thing right I feel like me you
are unsisterly little thing now yoni oh
yeah I do just want to point out pretty
little thing we're super super kind to
send me half of these clothes so thank
you so so much for doing that however
half of it I did by myself because I
wanted to get like a lot like a lot I
feel like if I'm gonna do this video
then I may as well go all out and like
buy a lot you know basically just my
excuse to get more clothes ready but I'm
so grateful for them sending me some
bits but that will in no way affect my
opinion on something because if I think
something shit it's shit do you know
what I mean why why would I sit here and
lights you guys like believe me
your guys's trust in me is way more
important than just receiving a 10 pound
top for free there is no BS over here
you can't smell the BS okay anyway if
you guys want to know whether these
little pieces I got from pretty door
think are worth spending your money on
then just keep watching what do we start
with you know well let's keep it simple
let's go basic now I love myself a
simple basic like more I wasn't sure I
was going
basically anything basic I feel like is
a staple I feel like we all need a good
ol basic and when I saw this some pretty
little thing I just like had to have it
this is so me it literally is a black
oversized t-shirt dress which on camera
looks bloody huge like why does that
look so big fit body frame in there the
material is just like a simple coin but
it feels nice and thick like it doesn't
feel see-through in the slightest which
is fast the model looks really cool
wearing it and I was like should I try
being cool out right as far as sizing
and prices go there is literally one of
my hairs just chilling on it comes in
one size like it the size is actually
called one size which pretty little
thing babes like are we all one size
we're not we not okay all different body
sizes different shapes and it's
beautiful like that and I feel like when
you put something to one size it just
doesn't fit for everyone and that that
annoys me like someone who's really
really pretty
is it gonna look huge and backe on them
and then someone who's a little bit
bigger a little bit more curvy is it
gonna look super tight on them I I don't
know maybe it's just me I just don't
like it so hopefully this is okay don't
find out and it was it was only ten
pounds though which is such a box if
this fits well this is gonna be like a
solid tin on its in seeing out its in
let's try on let's see how I would style
it oh my god I love it this is probably
my favorite t-shirt dress they actually
own I love it it comes to the perfect
length you know everything is covered
the tushy is fully covered even if the
wing comes like cheeks are gonna be in
it's the perfect like oversized mist you
know what I mean like we're doing it's
so comfy as well to be honest with you I
don't even want to try anymore on I'm
like can I just be like this please
I feel like it's kind of cool as well
it's so easy to wear I am op freaking
test
I've kept it kind of like chill and cash
so for shoes if you can see I went with
my class take vans and then my necklace
this here it's a little like three plus
a three way but that just sounds it's
like one necklace but it has three
necklaces on it if that makes sense this
is from H&amp;amp;M I select this
look super cute of like a little
backpack or something like holding it
over the one shoulder if you think they
were risky I love it but honestly love I
feel like this is definitely gonna be
one of my favorite pieces in this entire
haul oh my god laughter dump these
shades by the way are from Primark I I'm
actually obsessed this t-shirt is for me
gets a solid ten out of ten eleven are
10 12 Alton I love it
now I don't know why but I have been
obsessing over suits I mean guys in a
suit is like Hello but girls in a suit
like Hello I feel like it looks so bomb
like a boss bitch and I'm I'm here
friend guys and when I saw this one I
was like you can like dress this up
dresses down I was feeling it so the
trousers and the blazer you do buy
separately which i think is cool cause I
see a different size on top to bottom
and all that jazz these are the trousers
here I think they're just like wide leg
trousers and then down the side they
have stripes here like five four five
stripes I can't go I'm really intrigued
to see how this is gonna make my legs
look because sometimes things on the
side can like make an illusion commit
your legs it's smaller bigger will find
out the material as well is like real
interesting I don't even know what you
would call it it's nice and thick it's
kind of like Shiva no it's not chiffon
is it I don't know it feels good it
feels good and then the Blazer is kind
of like a fitted blazer I guess couple
stripes down the arms and then it also
comes with you know the thing that kind
of it goes when your waist like bring
you in to give you a little bit of shape
which I really really like basically I
just want to see how I looking a suit to
be honest I mean if I can look as cool
as the model and I mean okay the
trousers I got in a size 6 whenever it
comes to wide leg trousers I always size
down I'm usually in a just because I
feel like they'll fit me a bit better
and look a little bit nicer when we look
like on the legs and then the blaze
where I also size down and got a six
just cuz I really wanted it to be nice
and you know fit it the trousers were 18
and the Blazer was 20 so that's 38
pounds why am i speaking like this I
don't know if I any pounds I feel like
if this is cool on me then that's true
that's true
let's uh let's try it on honestly pretty
little thing you have my heart this is a
same this honestly fits so well I'm so
glad I got a size six in both you can't
really see the ends of the trousers but
believe me when I say these honestly
come to the perfect length they don't
drag on the floor anything this is so
freakin cool like hello I love the
stripes I feel like it's a really cool
like touch I just um kind of zest
I've still got these same glasses on
from Primark and still the same necklace
my boobs melon booties these from
Primark yeah you could even add like a
cute little bag to go with it this one
is from I swear first also by the way
the trousers are room elasticated so
they fit so well like they just sort of
cling to your body honestly if they have
this in other colours I would literally
get every single one this is the vibe
I'm obsessed the only thing I wish I had
was pockets but part from that I want to
say this is such a vibe next thing I
have to show you guys is a cute little
table it's so cute so like crochet and
holy holy huh it is this a little number
he is just this door little white
crochet top it's kind of high neck the
sleeves look like this and I have my
little frilly bits on the shoulder
there's a little frill on the bottom and
then it does not buy like a huge tip
attack I feel like this is gonna be that
perfect top you know why don't you throw
on the pair of jeans and you look ten
times more done up is this top well I
mean that's how I looked on the model
when you weight it is see-through of
course
hence the holes do you go out like a
cute little bra underneath or just like
a white bra or something that's how I'm
gonna do it anyway I think I'm not
usually a frill kind of girl to be
honest but this is cute this was cute I
stuck to my size with this top just
because obviously there's like no
stretching this oh thought broke it
Wow yeah I got an eight and it was 25
pounds which I mean it is a more higher
quality top so totally expect that leg
up see how it looks on here's the white
top on I have to say pro thing again you
killed it I really love everything I
feel like you guys are probably gonna
think Jordan really you love everything
I honestly love everything how cute is
the little white top though it is so
different I don't have anything like it
in my wardrobe which is really cool I
left a little fret on the shoulder it
kind of mainz me like Bolton days
but it's like modern do you not I mean I
normally don't like this length gonna be
honest I feel like sometimes it's really
awkward but where it's sort of freely I
think it's kind of cute it is a teeny
bit big I feel like if you want it to be
tight size down but this is what it
looks like work one little little thing
I will say though if you have sensitive
skin that really really sensitive skin
you might find this a little bit itchy I
don't personally excited how sensitive
skin it's fine for me I'd go out in it
and feel comfortable by do some of the
same i boys and girls out there with
sensitive skin you may like find this a
bit uncomfortable to wear my back by the
way is from River Island my jeans these
are actually from pretty little thing
I've got my while ago I'm just wearing
some white little boot start from a
nasty girl which I'm obsessed with these
boobs so much whenever I wear why I'm
like yeah stick these on I love the
whole like crochet vibe of it all and
everything basically I like it a lot
gonna do a switch up now and show you
guys some shoes holy frickin guacamole
these shoes I'm actually like in love
with these shoes I feel like we have a
connection they can't make you box oh
really thing every time they are
actually gorge like I don't even know
anymore
there is for sure some of you at home
being like you these are the coolest
boots you've ever seen and you're like
oh nice
as soon as I saw these on the website
I've never been something in my basket
so fast a nude chunky biker suede boot
cool things on your feet I'm gonna live
in these kind of situation they're suede
they have kind of like faux leather bits
all around then they have like these
straps as well like a little buckle each
straps chunky sort of so I love the lace
up front I can see these paired with
whites and all nude outfit would look
amazing I'm just so glad I've got these
guys like these are this is me in a shoe
and what does Jordan do when she likes
something so much she gets them in
another color do you bet your ass they
got them in black - black is such a
staple color shoe it goes with
everything we all need a pair of black
boots shoes trainers whatever in our
life and these are the brand new edition
new addition to the farm these are like
the Jesus of my shoes they literally are
exactly the same - this
or forever chunky so everything's you
know what the black ones I actually
wanted the Louis Vuitton boots I will
put a picture in here I still want them
no but how will seminar they to them it
just you know these were out the LV so
they're PLC you know by the way I got
them in a size five that's minimal size
they are true to size and they were
forty five pounds each which I am not
matter at all in fact for a pair of
shoes I like love how does a steel if
you ask me okay I feel like it's about
time we get a little bit more dressy up
in this house thing I'm looking at this
dress like this is so extra the top is
basically kind of mesh got little panels
down it as you can see kind of hi Nikesh
has long sleeves as well and then you
ready look at the skirt have you ever
seen so much fluffiness in your life is
legit covered in feathers if this is not
the most like extra Jess you've ever
seen your life then I don't know what is
I have nothing in my wardrobe like this
at all I have no idea where I'm gonna
wear this to but I just have to have it
like I said the top is mesh you do have
to you know wear a little something to
cover these little guys I'm not gonna
lie it feels really really nice the
model looked insane in it and I just
apparently apparently every time I stuck
to my size with this I got a size a and
it definitely is more on the pricier
side it was 60 pounds which is expensive
I'm not gonna lie we're not we're not
playing around here but if this fits
really really well what then okay but
that's what I'm here to show you guys
umm how adorable is this dress it's so
strange because I don't think I'd
normally pick out it just like this and
then I start on the model and I was like
yeah I need that no I have on actually
kind of love it it's also strange
because I feel like it's a little bit
daring you know you go going on K we got
mesh up here we've got butt action down
here but it's sorry what wearable and
just so cute ignore the bra situation
I've put on the plainest white bra
you've ever seen in your life the skirt
comes to a really really nice length
like everything it's
it's nowhere near short at all I paired
it with this cute little clutch here
this is from I saw it first it's just
like light pink because my shoulders
smash snails oh my shoes are the class
of new shabby ones from boohoo it fits
pretty nicely as well at the waist is
fab it really really is like it sucks
you in the only thing I would change
though is these sleeves iPhones are a
little bit loose I don't really know why
I feel like I wanted to be like take but
apart from that everything else by
really really love definitely a yes for
me the next thing I have here is another
kind of like basic item it's basic but
it's not basic because it's literally
piping is this just not like one of the
best paint colors ever they're like
really light baby pink it is basically
just a t-shirt literally a t-shirt and
it says Brooklyn in white on the front I
love the pink and the white I think it's
such a vibe it's a simple basic cotton
t-shirt it is a thing oversized like
naturally a bit more oversized and
because of that I stuck to a small just
because you know I didn't want it to be
like oh it was only ten pounds as well
so like I said just a simple basic item
this is cute no let's roll the trunklid
okay right before I say anything about
this stop please excuse the fact there's
about 20 million creases in it that's
just like ignore this this top is just
so simple but I love that I love the
color
it sounded like I've kept it really
really simple with the outfit this is
like an everyday outfit for me I've kind
of liked the topping at the front I mean
you could wear it like untucked you
could even maybe like tie it here for
like a crop top style I don't know I
like it Simon Cowell style personally
the bag is from H&amp;amp;M my jeans these are
so cool they have like no triangle
clouds for the front hug to you these
are from at naked fashion and then of
course my Air Force Ones simple like I
said super carriage everyday outfit this
is the perfect top for that so yeah I
like it even though it's so simple I
really really like it I mean would this
really be a Jordan Lipscomb whole if I
didn't include a two-piece
I think not so the next thing is it to
feast why to be honest with you this was
a piece that because the model looked
that good she looked that good I had to
get it I just had to get it
so the Wow it's on the floor it's on the
floor appalling it is in this amazing
stony beige new color nude at the moment
is like a thing everyone's in nudes that
cool Wow I literally was thought I was
gonna be 60 under this is a body corner
skirt which goes on for days this is
actually a Medoc sea skirts with on
those skirts that come like above your
ankle like this is hella long I've never
been the kind of girl to wear things
that long because I always used to think
they made me like a little stumped I
made me look stumped I'm actually pre
overage why I'm like 5 foot 6 so I don't
know and then the little top that it
comes with is like a basic little crop
top it looks really small on camera like
this only gonna cover like a nip but I'm
pretty sure it did come like kind of
normal the matera isn't that why I
expected I thought was gonna be you know
that like Jersey stretchy material
I mean it's stretchy still as you can
see but it's like a thick cotton I mean
I don't know if it's gonna be see fur or
not but um I don't know feel good this
guy is a size 6 I don't know why any
skirts that like really long I always
size down logic and then the top is in a
size 8 and it was really affordable as
well
the skirt was 15 and the top was a
somewhat that's um 23 do you know I find
that right that was quick
muffs like I feel like a proud mom this
could look so cool during the day with
some flats or like with some heels and a
jacket let's try it on and see how I
would style it here is the little nude
code on the fit is amazing like it is so
tight everything just is so like in
which when you're wearing body con is
exactly what you want no we don't want
to like bagginess anywhere I'm obsessed
with the color like nude at the moment I
feel like it's on everybody's like
must-haves this is what it looks like
that the back excuse the label Wow one
thing I will say though is when you
first get it it is sorry restricting on
your legs you walk like this this is
gonna sound so weird you're gonna be
like all right Jordan thanks but
actually walk like don't be scared to
walk cuz when I first did I don't wash
track shit I was like okay
just have to like stretch the bottom out
and then like you're good to go the
length if I can show you literally comes
just above my ankles I feel like to cash
this up I could put on my teddy bear
coat which by the way is from H&amp;amp;M nude
on note you literally can't go wrong
this is such a cute outfit right
why did she love everything if you're
looking for a nude cold like this pretty
little thing go to pretty little thing I
literally have only a couple more things
to show you guys and the next thing is
got lipstick everywhere there's another
suit that's covered in lipstick so good
I wanted to get this suit though because
like the last one I got was more cash
this one I definitely think is more you
know like going out and I'm all about
trying new things you guys I'm all about
trying the new GoM's
genuinely don't think I've ever said
that in my entire 20 years of existence
on this earth so where did that come
from who even knows the trousers are
just kind of straight leg wide leg
situation trousers that is black and
then the Blazer the front of the Blazers
you know like this bit here is quite low
cut which i think is really really nice
so you know you get that sort of like
open chest situation or you could just
like wrap it around and like cover you
up it's totally up to you what you're
comfortable with this sleeves I love I
think it acts like such a feminine touch
they are like bell sleeves if you can
see that and then of course you get the
belt thing to tie around and keep
everything sucked in this to me is the
definition of a feminine suit if you
want a suit but you've still known it
really girly I feel like this is that
also the material of this is really
interesting it's definitely more
lightweight like it's way way thinner
and it's really like soft I can't
explain it but what is also really cool
about this as well this is part of the
petite range now I'm laughing because I
can just picture them well um I don't
know what it is pretty little thing
why they're Charles's always so long
when I say long I mean like your legs
would have to be like this long to fit
it I just don't get it so I'm hoping
that because this is petite you'll be a
lot shorter so yeah like I said any sort
of wide leg trousers always size down so
the listener six the blaze is actually
in a ten so like hopefully it's fine
is in a ten because there was no other
sizes the massive that's brilliant what
did this I was like f it I'm gonna get
it even though I have like basically no
boobs to put in this embracing embraced
itty-bitty stays loose with me now this
was actually a bit more on the pricier
side the Blazer was 25 and the trousers
are 20 so that's 45 pounds which I
actually think is a little bit pricey
compared to the other stuff anyway but
you know what it's all about the fit and
it's all about the fit and the quality
let's try it on let's see if I can look
as good as the this is one of my
favorite suits
it is so girly yet so kind of classy at
the same time oh you guys turn 20 and
now cami I mean suits everywhere fits
really really nicely especially the top
consider this is a 10 this fits so well
I love the sleeves so much in s so cool
one thing I did notice though I look to
the suit is let's have a bun and mine
just doesn't have a bottom I guess it's
like some sort of error on there and I
don't really care though because you
have this bit around the middle to kind
of slow everything out rousers okay one
thing I probably shoulda thought about I
got a petite Sogang a 6 on the bun it's
a little bit tight it's pretty tight on
the top half like there's not much um
rim for anything I don't really have you
know the biggest bum or anything but it
is high and it's like tight around my
waist I mean that's a good thing since
it's not gonna fall down it's fine like
it's not uncomfortable anything I just
probably should have got a the length
flow for petite
this is what I'm talking about the
length is literally perfect like why why
aren't all the flowers like this by the
way I paired it with my clear heels from
boohoo and I've still got the necklace
on from H&amp;amp;M but I wish I pockets though
I'm such a puppy go I'm still 100% gonna
wear this and I still freaking love it
so yeah you've done it again you filled
it again we are on to the last thing if
you made it this far get this video
thumbs up we have a little sort of shirt
dress
here can you hear the material of this
it's very like shirty I mean I know it's
a shirt dress but it's very snazzy it's
just a basic black shirt dress and then
around the middle there is these little
bits of material which actually holds
this ring so it has like this ring
detail around the waist which I think
kind of like spices it up a little bit
you'll see a power in the model because
that was just the most awful showing
thing ever if you know me you'll know
how much I love a shirt dress they're so
easy to throw on and I think they look
fat but one of my favorites is actually
from parade all the thing it was the
Kourtney Kardashian collection I love
that stacks my size a size 8 and it was
25 pounds let's have a look and see what
this looks like on this is the one item
that I'm a bit like about I'm not gonna
send it back though because I definitely
think you could work with this however
this just doesn't fit properly
you probably concede that this should be
sat like here on my waist and kind of
like bring this in to give it a bit more
shape but instead it's just like sitting
down here and kind of like not doing
anything should be like up here but it's
here I don't know it just doesn't fit
here it does come to a really really
nice length oh it's such a nice shirt
dress I love how like this skirt there
the bottom comes out gives it a bit more
shape and makes it kind of girly rather
them just like normal shirt dresses are
like you know really is this bit that I
don't like I just don't get why it's
here it's just like hanging but the good
thing is you can actually take the
little ring out which is what I'm gonna
do look at that two bits of material
just like and I'm gonna take my own bail
hide these bits of material underneath
because like what is this what are you
you look how much better that is this
makes my waist look Fritton tiny or is
it just me I think it's where this comes
out like me I prefer this so much more
like this this is way better
it's kind of sad because I did buy this
shirt dress for this details of what
this was really cool and then it makes
me think is it worth buying this shirt
Dressel so you could just get like a
normal shirt dress but this shirt dress
has this shape at the bottom like this
or girly skirt so I don't know this part
by the way is from Primark I've probably
put it with some heels or maybe for like
daytime some trainers or something this
is like a hit Animus I miss because
let's be real it didn't fit probably and
hard to kind of
do my own thing with it but then it's a
hit because I made it work so I'm so hot
okay everything has been tried on we
have to test it out pretty little thing
I am pretty happy you guys I don't
really have anything bad to say there
was a couple things I probably could
have fit better you know like that I
would have preferred but having said
that I'm still gonna wear everything
like I'm not gonna be sending anything
back and when you don't send anything
back that's when you know you've got a
good order my personal favorites have to
be the shoes the two suits I love to the
black t-shirt dress as well and also the
light little white dress setting are so
key to be honest with you I pretty much
loved everything the black shirt dress
was probably my least favorite thing I
think that could have fed way better
part Parfum that you girls happy so the
real question is would I recommend
brittle thing to you guys
