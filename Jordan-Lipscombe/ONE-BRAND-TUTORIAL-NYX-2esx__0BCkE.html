around for faces or a few guys that this
time is drugstore I am doing it on one
of my favorite drugstore brands ever
which is next so I am giving you guys my
first impressions and thoughts on either
products and now as they create the look
that I'm wearing or right now it's
something so different it's pretty bold
as well I mean I've even got a pop of
color which is something different for
me so we are switching it up today but
it was so fun to do like makeup is just
creative it washes off you do even how
you want to do so just before we start
this video if you guys do you want to
see a little bit more of me don't forget
to hit the subscribe our model here and
also I wrote it
he's been labelled as well and then you
guys witness out on anything and if all
of this is enough and you want to see
even more of me you guys can follow me
on all my other social media platforms
so my Instagram snapchat and Twitter so
without further ado let's just jump
straight in video so I have my brows
already filled in already done you know
the drill so I start off using the
eyebrow powder pencil in a soft brown
which has pencil on one end video any
other not enough and another pencil
itself really isn't that bad it's quite
creamy however because it's creamy it
starts getting blunt super super quickly
and then I can't create precise lines
and then my eyebrows should start
getting messy and well it would probably
stressful stressful beginning so I
decided to switch over to that payment
frame which is their brow pomade now the
consistency of this was a little bit
strange it was quite wet and it's so
pigmented but you need to solicit amount
like hold back with this I do really
like it though I saw it like on eyebrow
products so you have like one thing that
you use and like nothing beats that if I
didn't have to recommend one to guys I
would definitely say the pomade the
pencil hidden works for me a mountain of
skin I'm going to prime it using the
pore filler primer which says that it
can minimize the appearance of pores and
it can be worn over our door without
makeup only the makeup I can actually
get out what the heck is like for the
primer everywhere right now
Oh home joking it state with me
what that is smooth though I can
accomplish three committees it kinda
reminds me like a drier version of the
professional concerns this is kind of
strange but we're put into your skin I'm
liking it if I look at my skin close up
my paws actually look minimized now to
take the crap out of my face I'm using
the steam at would not flush foundation
when off reward space full coverage
mineral rich to matte finish I'm using
the cut-up fresh sage I am matching it
to my neck I do have a little bit of
sector left on my face but it's kind of
wearing off so matching it matching two
minutes oh I've never probably uses
foundation but i've swatched it before
and it does have a nice matte finish but
you guys know about that Julie life I
want to be glowy
so I'm going to mix in some of these
these are their profound Asian mixer
this is the luminous one they do have a
bunch of different ones so they have
ones that are different like little
blood oh my god brain swap to make like
a different finish they would have ones
to make your foundation darker lighter
change the time there is something a few
drops of death a few drops Jordan I mean
the whole bottle you know what that's a
pre dying good color if anything is
probably like a tad bit too yellow bears
oh my god okay in the camera literally
like a Simpson okay we can work with it
like wonderful consider and stuff on
you've never know coverage is born
though I guess I diving into the skin
like this really helps to like build up
the coverage job are those drops of
really help to give it a super nice
finish loving it
honestly so far I'm so impressed with
this Sunday should know like my skin
looks nice the coverage is really nice
the finish is really nice doesn't look
cakey doesn't it heavy
everything about it I'm liking and like
oh my god concealer I'm using is the HD
studio photogenic
concealer it's not really my color I
mean it is important which is the
lightest shade but we work with it it's
going to go for like the super
highlighted look today of course do the
center of my face to even it out so they
look crazy
then this out with my little baby sponge
like look how small he is it's blending
out so easily
coverage is nice don't like these
fullest coverage concealer ever but
considering how hydrating and nicely
underneath my eyes got decent coverage I
am happy with that so just everything in
Poston going in it with this pattern out
of me and this powder little bit about
our relationship going on is the HD
studio photogenic finishing powder which
Jesus it is a super super finely milled
loose powder now what I love about this
powder is that honestly makes my skin
just look so smooth I could don't know
whether you can turn on camera but this
side of my face is just so smooth out
makes the skin look amazing however the
flush back that you get from this powder
amount if such a shame oaks that leaves
my skin looking amazing but if there's
like flash photography around me no way
as you know that you're not going to be
around to slash photography definitely
give this a go if you are go out the
color back in now because I'm looking
just a little bit like you know I'm
using the matte bronzer in the color
deep tan now I picked this up because it
reminded me a lot of my Matt gives me
some which is like my all-time favorite
bronzer so you know I snatched that up
so it's honestly bending owl so nicely
the color is really nice - it's warm but
I love the inner border it's not patchy
it's not muddy it's just everything I
would want in a bronzer okay Nick I
don't have a contour from them so we
just have to use the bronzer to try like
hide the double check could want to see
see myself using this on a daily basis
and for that tap em now for blush this
is the sweet cheeks palette now I've
used this before and I have to say these
are amazing like there's every color in
here for every different skin tone is
five I mean then this color here these
are pigmented but you don't need a lot
says me he puts like the whole palette
on her face I know buddy oh gosh going
to go I thought there's a bunch of like
neutral colors in here that I could work
with which I'll up my street pretty
afterglow for my highlight next I've
just come out with these zero chromatic
illuminating powders and I'm going to
take the one called snow rose which
basically
in Oslo it's just like a white that in
the light reflex pink now whenever
you're going to pick highlighters so
this should be interesting
oh my god there's like an actual pink
hue to it but it's nice because when I
look for wet it doesn't that work this
just a pink strip on my face I swear
every single time upon highlight it's
like I've never used it before my life I
get that excited no you can't forget
keeping like all of us so cool it's like
a wearable geo Chrome yes also I just
want to mention they have fall out a
bunch like I mean a bunch of liquid
highlighters they are called oh my god
there is like a hair on my face
somewhere and it's tickling yeah I'll
called away we glow see what you got man
X see what you done so if you're into
your liquid highlighters I love these
and spaces to powders but just want to
let you know they're there if you're
interested out onto eyes now honestly
I've tried a bunch of NYX eye shadows
before they are by far some of the best
drugstore eyeshadows out there amazing I
wrote them I've not tried these now I
think these are pretty new I've got
these when I went to the Knicks store
opening it the other day and holy crap
look at them they are called the perfect
filter palettes now this one's called
Golden Hour which is just a really
pretty formzee gold color and then they
have this one which is called rustic
antique which is like Burgundy's oranges
you know about this so I think I'm going
to go at for this one I'm going to go
into the orange here well that looks
pigmented I'm just going to buff that
into the crease what Ivan said as though
that is blending out so nicely to keep
them dude honestly just blend into your
Ansel's off to be honest like but I'm
going to clean out and put this like in
the crease like below the orange and
onto the ledge is kind of like
everywhere
a blending so nicely into each other - I
never have a bad word to say about the
next eyeshadows because they're like one
of my faves this palette though honestly
so good
um is like perfectly brown color and
just pack that on the outer corner
all of these eyeshadows i'm just-just
pigmented as each other so good there is
like a teeny teeny bit of fallout with
this color but put miss of neon just
take in like the same brush I used in my
crease earlier to blend that up don't
want any harsh lines on my inner corner
to be like pardon I'm going to wet my
brush I'm going to mix together the
matte white and the shimmery one here I
just go having that in corner yeah okay
guys if there's anything that you can
get from this tutorial you need this
palette in your you need uniqueness cut
in your vise just going to run from the
orange underneath my eye is the face
I've used a shadow before and I've just
seen it and I'll every want to use it
this is the prismatic eyeshadow in rose
dust and I kind of want to put this just
like in the inner side of my lid oh my
God look how nice that is
I hope they come and pick it up but
that's with my brush like not even wet
these prismatic eyeshadows are insane
they're kind of like a forward finish
though so good show what you think I
might add a pop of color on the lower
lash line because I've not yet done with
a pop of color let's do it I'm going to
take this blue which that's blue one of
our four single eyeshadows and it's
called
electroshock
as per usual so pigmented
that's so cool it's a little bit crazy
right now because I've got like new
lashes or anything but cool I'm not
ready to kind of go I've kind of having
to do it but and planted it so I
probably will ends up putting on lashes
because it's me I really intense at this
in sky is the NYX double stacked mascara
so you get the base in the top coat and
also little fibers here and stuff with
the base well that applies so much
product all taking the fibers all record
up at the waited thing it book sorry
illiterate circum putting fluff or my
eyelashes you guys see that it's made
like my lashes white I don't see that
much difference with the length is
separated them out a little bit more
like I look like I've got more eyelashes
which is good I don't hate it but it's
not like my favorite you know you know
I'm going to go off camera and just do
the other eye apply some lashes and your
girl will be back okay so we think we
are good to go if this inner corner
would just like stick down you know by
the way these lashes because I know I'll
probably get questions are backstage
lashes in rodeo drive-- they are one of
my favs them and Melrose Avenue you need
them you just have lips left I'm what
should I do
I have like every single shade from NYX
possible so options are endless you know
I think I'm going to go all out into the
darkness because always do a nude so I'm
going to take the NYX suede matte lip
liner in vintage let's give this a blow
that going on so nicely for a matte lip
liner I thought it was going to be quite
like you know rather then but it's
learning that them nicely oh my God look
at my lips right now and they're like a
chola before the main cut out I'm going
in with one of the liquids waves in it
