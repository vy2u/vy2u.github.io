so we are correcting a little bit
differently today is a makeup tutorial
on the makeup that I'm wearing right now
but ah that was really dramatic instead
of me already having my eyebrows done
and then coming on a dinner most ammonia
car actually started with some of my
base makeup on and I'll show you guys in
depth how I like to do my eyebrows we're
just switching it around today yeah why
not so in beginning part of this video
is all about brows and it is in depth
because I don't think you want to show
you guys how you can get sabe F brows
but without the hassles all the time or
the effort we're talking quick Aneesa
yes because that'd be really nice sort
of stores the point want we just don't
want our eyebrows to be the hardest part
of our makeup and guess what does it
have to be guys and here to share with
you something which makes brows super
easy and super quick so without further
ado I hope that you guys enjoy this
video or find it helpful and let's get
into it so do have half of my base done
I just need to add the kana and the
highlight back so brows brows are
looking a little worse but I mean it
looks better this is what I have been
using this is the Loreal brow artist
expert mechanical pencil and there is a
cause of spooning on the end because you
know we all going to comb through them
browse honey's and now I'll tell you I
love this so of course brow pencils give
that more kind of softer finish but this
one is so quick and easy to use because
of the shape of it I mean when I saw her
I was like how am I meant to use that
but I promise once you start using it as
easy trust rate basically if they
triangle shaped pencil which means you
can use the outlines to really outline
in define your brow then you use the
flat surface of the tribal to fill it in
at the same time so not only am i
outlining web browsers but I'm filling
it in too but what's also great is the
color range now it comes in eight
different shades I do have every single
one here to show you guys now what I've
seen she's you get like groups of colors
so you have three different shades of
blonde four different shades of brunette
and ebony like you have everything I
know that it can be super hard to find
the right undertone for your brow
products sometimes they're way too
orange in one other times they're just
like way too gray and you kind of want
that in between rows with this you get
three different tones of the same shade
so your files are 400
I'm just going to really really quickly
run through the colors and show you
swatches so if you are interested you
can see the colors in action and so for
the blonde we have blonde warm blonde
and cool blonde pretty self-explanatory
for the color so the blonde is more that
like topi typical blonde shade so if you
like a really cool tone for our perfect
for youth then the warm blonde and the
cool blonde are actually more kind of
brown tone so if you do like a darker
brow with your winged hair these will be
perfect and of course ones warmer one's
cooler now for the brunette so this is
my color range here I know I do have
blonde hair but I like to stick to a
brunette pencil because my eyebrow hairs
are brown so that is brunette ash
brunette cool brunette and warm brunette
I've said brunette too many times it
doesn't select word anymore - brunette
this is the one I use is that that in
between standard brunette shade not too
cool not to want and then just you know
the difference between ash brunette and
cool brunette ash is way more kind of
gray undertone a lot more corner then of
course you've got evany which is a super
super dark brown color almost black so
if all them people were like the good
old dark brows they got your back I'm
going to stop talking about the product
itself now and actually show you guys
how I like to use it and the result that
it gives step one spoolie for your brows
I recite to brush through the brows hair
just to get them in a place so I can see
where I really need to fill in step 2
you want to start shaping your eyebrow
outlining them and get into shape by
what this is going to fill in at the
same time because of the shape of the
pencil but yeah I'm going to focus on
the shape that I want I'm even the front
of the eyebrow so now we're just
focusing on it filling in the rest of my
eyebrow when I get towards the tail of
the eyebrow I slip the pencil around to
the pointed end is facing downwards and
we have to do is literally
swipe and you get that much sharp end of
your tail it's so easy now it's time for
step 3
this is filling in at the front of your
eyebrow now of course you kind of want
less product here you don't want to be
as harsh what I do is create two lines
so I create one underneath my eyebrow
and on top and then I use the spoolie
so really comb through that product to
soften it and then that's how you get
that so gradient then you don't can see
this is the before this is the artists
it's like hugely different it just is a
lot more defined way more filled in so
I'm just going to go ahead and repeat
the exact same things on this eyebrow
one more step that you can do so step
four is you can go in with a little bit
of concealer just underneath your
eyebrow
clean it up so if I see myself I take a
small amount of concealer underneath the
front of my eyebrow just the front to
clean up that line so the gradient is a
lot cleaner towards the front
but eyebrows are done I did it in four
easy steps I just really wanted to show
you guys that eyebrows don't need to be
difficult they don't need to be the bane
of makeup I find something that works
and find something that's really easy to
use like this Loreal brow artist expert
pencil and trust me
eyebrows will not be a pain to do
anymore now to carry on with my makeup
so like I said I do already have half of
my face on if you do want to know what
is in my face already I will leave it in
the description box below let's be
honest with you to be honest with you
man it is pretty much what I always
battle around true match Maybelline fit
me concealer iconic London drop unit add
some color I'm using it the NYX matte
bronzer in deep have just going to warm
up my skin bring onto this 5s just dry
make this five head into a forehead
police have come to this cheek here onto
the jaw line and the next one cut out
like whatever what is that like no
honestly the double chin is real it's
real just take them over zest on the
brush on the tip of my nose it just
makes me look a little bit more time
tons which I'm after been at for blush
I'm taking one from this Oprah blush
palette like I'm going out sheet what
more is it there we go so many colors in
here you pretty much my blush for every
single makeup look which is fab Sofra
you're doing it right I'm going to go in
with a peachy shade here because the
makeups can be quite peachy and just put
that on the apples these are really
really pigmented by the way which is why
I'm applying with a different brush this
Atene X there are a brush it just
applies kind of less product I find I
just like this kind of brush doesn't
apply it like all in one go it just
spreads it out nicely I'm not going to
go in and contour anything I really want
to keep it kind of soft ground but you
girls going to highlight of course this
is the Anastasia Beverly Hills Nicole
Guerrero palette which oh it's all bit
I'm only going with glow against someone
for for you pretty much it's just all of
them so I just just come in babe
or my nose to keep it though as well I'm
going to belly up up here as well
because why not basically just put over
your entire face
and then I just grab the top with my
sponge just to make sure there's no
lines great onto the eyes so I'm using
the two saved sweet peach optional
palette which looks something like this
so pretty and it smells incredible but
can I just eat this please can I just so
just like in the color white peach and
I'm going to set my entire lid with this
just to create a nice base now I'm going
to go ahead and take a mixture of
Georgia and candid peach and just start
working this into the crease as my
transition color I'm just going in a
circular motions just like this
just throwing it back in to build up the
color to get it as intense everyone I'm
kind of pacing the color in the crease
and then I'm blending it up towards the
brow now I'm going to go in with the
color called summer young which is just
like this burn orangie brown color I'm
going to Pat this on all over the lid
and start to blend into that like crease
color we just put in these eye shadows
are so pigmented and they just blend so
easily into each other also this is
going to be a really really easy look to
do I'm literally using these colors and
that's it I'm just using a brush to pack
the color all over my lids and then I'm
taking that same brush that we used for
the crease color into shooting it's
going to help simple now I'm just going
to go ahead and take this makeup geek
full spectrum I line up whole pencil in
well smooth going to put this into my
waterline I'm just taking the same
colors that we used on our lids just
underneath here so everything blends in
together the colors a candid peach and
summer young by the way I'm going to be
wearing a full seeds but of course we
need some mascara to blend these lashes
into the false on so this is I'm too
faced better than sex I just go in with
a really quick coat of this
puffles lashes I'll let you just like
take a guess of what ones I'm going to
use like I'll give you a minute just to
think about it backstage in Rodeo Drive
the one going always use some using it
might save lash glue which is duo wanna
see to be best eyelash glue enough and
they are on her truck while they are
drying I'm going to go ahead and put
some mascara on my bottom lashes oh my
god do I going to sneeze with or please
don't sneeze just on one mascara because
it we're good Oh something's missing
from the eyes and I kind of want to put
a little bit flare in the inner corner
we're doing I'm using the LA stash
crystallized with tiny angels tip she's
going to populate up in the inner corner
yes
now that's what I'm talking about that's
going to go out that sell with this
brush look how cute this brushes it's a
huge accomplish like are you serious
sorry freaking cute summit so the last
thing to complete this makeup look is of
course the lips now I think I want some
sort of like peachy nude color kind of
time with you guys I'm going to use one
of these brand new L'Oreal nudist matte
lip paints on far as are where these
haven't been released yet well these
colors anyway we sort of it nude colors
these are right out my street if you
know me you know another good note come
on myself new lipstick by the way I know
some of you I think a solid so these are
kind of sort of 208 off-white which is
just the kind of palest peachy nude 210
which is called dead lips it's slightly
darker than the first one more kind of
Browns ironed 211 baby which is even
darker but more kind of pink tones and
then as 209 nude on fleek which is the
darkest at a peachy Brown I think I'm
going to go ahead and use a nude on a
fake oh yes honey let's see
dude really is on Zeke oh yes these feel
amazing so creamy oh my god
these smell incredible as well really
really fruity I have to say the formula
is really really nice it's a super
hydrating Maps formula it's not a liquid
lipstick or anything it doesn't dry down
like it does transfers bath feels so
comfortable so I'm down for it for this
matte finish is really pretty but I kind
of wanna switch us so I'm going to put a
gloss on I never do gloss
I'm usually a matte lip kind of girl you
know what we lost today this is the a2
FISA whether the accent come from Too
Faced sweet peach the Too Faced sweet
peach creamy peach lip oil gloss thingy
