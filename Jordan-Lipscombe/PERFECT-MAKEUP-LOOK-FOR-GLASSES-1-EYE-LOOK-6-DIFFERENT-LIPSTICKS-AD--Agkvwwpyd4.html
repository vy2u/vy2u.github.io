all doing really really well and are
having a fab week so far I have a little
bit of a different video for you guys
today which I'm really excited about
I've wanted to film one of these videos
on my channel now for so long but I
wanted everything to be really good
quality and I finally found something
which is definitely worth sharing with
you guys so we're doing it today's video
is my version of the perfect eye makeup
look to wear with glasses it is one look
that will suit a bunch of glasses so
it's super versatile also I've teamed up
with glasses usa.com to bring you guys
this video I'm no prescription glasses
wearing myself I just wear them I mean I
just like the look of them basically
glasses USA were perfect to team up for
this video it because not only do they
do prescription glasses but they do just
regular glasses which is exactly what I
chose I am not joking guys there are so
many frames to choose from I have six to
share with you in this video but there
are so many you could just keep
scrolling and scrolling like let me tell
you I'm gonna find something I go love I
promise you probably thinking okay just
another website that sells glasses cool
but let's cook Marvel over here because
I'm going to show you guys a couple of
features on the website which is so cool
as you guys can see on the website you
can actually upload or just take a
picture of your face instantly and they
will virtually put the glasses on your
face so before you spend that dollar you
can actually see if they would see you
like how fab is that because oh girl
I've had my fair share of glasses that
mmm-hmm they call it a virtual mirror I
think you're such a good idea like I
said so many frames to choose from and I
think even some of them are like up to
70% off their retail price so bargain
obviously they have a bunch of like your
regular glasses as well but they also
have a a bunch of branded glasses as
well they have like Tom Ford Michael
Kors Chloe there is like loads and guys
can you see that can you see that they
have international shipping so all of
you can get your hands on these glasses
I just wanted to share a little bit of
info about them with you guys because to
me they aren't just like any other
glasses website the quality
of them and all the other like extra
features and stuff that they have kind
of to me be any other glasses website
like see ya oh just really quickly when
it's ad if you're not a glasses wearer
you could still totally watch this video
I'm not saying like only if you wear
glasses you can only watch this video
it's just a bronzy Goldy makeup look
which I pair with a ton of lip colors as
well so it can still totally be for you
I'm just naming it for glasses because
the shape of the eye makeup and stuff is
perfect for them so I'm going to quit
with the intro and actually get into the
video so if you want to see what I think
makes a really fab makeup look for
glasses and it's just keep watching so
as you guys can see I already have my
base makeup on my skin definitely
doesn't look like this normally I did
just use my Holy Grail makeup products
if you do wanna know what they are check
out a video I did a couple videos ago
it's all there but I just want this
video to be really I focus because
obviously it's about the glasses and me
showing you what makeup look will go
with it so I'm gonna do one makeup look
that is like super versatile let's get
to business there are two things I
actually think of when I think of a
makeup look that will suit all glasses
shapes and sizes and colors that is
sticking to neutral color so Browns
golds that kind of thing and then of
course to have the makeup visible
through glasses so what I think the key
to that is is keeping the makeup kind of
low here but we're gonna wing it out
winging it out because obviously all
glasses come out this way so you'll see
it and then keeping it kind of low here
because wherever you have glasses this
big or this big you're still gonna see
the makeup right let's get into it
okay so starting off taking a good old
fluffy little brush I'm gonna go ahead
and start off with a color like this
it's sort of a medium brown shade and
I'm gonna use that as my transition I'm
just gonna go back and forth in the
crease like these and then of course hit
the outer corner and sort of like bring
the other up here to sort of create that
wing you have throat about it too much
because we will clean the edge up with
concealer later but it's just to get
that initial like shape building up a
teeny a bit more obviously this doesn't
have to be anything too crazy it's just
the transition but I think a little more
won't hurt of course do the same thing
to the other eyeball Oh as well i also
did prime my eyes i just used some
concealer and then set
places somewhat translucent powder I
didn't show you it but definitely did it
see how I've kind of like kept the color
here I haven't blended it too far up to
my brows just trying to keep that color
a little bit lower so it fits in all
frames shapes and sizes now taking more
of this like flat smaller brush which
fits like perfectly in my outer corner
I'm going in with more of a darker rich
chocolatey brown color focusing this
just on the outer corner like this then
I'm gonna start to just pull back the
color here ever so slightly then I'm
taking that same brush we used for the
transition car just belen them two
colors together I'm gonna carry on
building up that color until it's as
intense as I like it's all about that
Blanc girls and boys all about that
blend also as well I want to do that
wing shape because we all know the
struggles with winged liner even still
to this day like winged islands
sometimes I like F up on an eye like I
do it and then either chit room where I
shadow and I'm like dang it you just end
up with instant regrets you know whereas
using your eye shadow it's easier but
you get like the same just all the
things you feel me
I'm into it I'm into it when you drop a
brush okay so I think we're good now you
want to go ahead and take any kind of
like bronzy coppery
kind of shadow just start packing it
onto the lid of course stopping like by
that outer corner pala weeper this color
is keeping it with a whole sort of color
scheme that I'm going for but it adds
just a little something-something
through the lid just away any fallout
that we cast going on gonna clean up
this outer corner and alex is looking a
little bit messy itty bitty brush like
this works perfectly anything for sort
of a flap small little edge to kind of
snatch the edge I'm going in with a
little bit concealer to do this if I
hadn't done my base makeup already I
just would have used a wipe but I can
say there it is I'm here we're just
gonna go like that but look how much
better that looks compared to that side
this is like and this is like mmm for
real though this is such a good tip if
you ever feel like your eyeshadow is
looking like mmm it's seen better days
grab a little bit of concealer just do a
little bit cleaning up I got you now I'm
gonna go ahead and apply it's a matte
mascara and then at Summit false lashes
I personally think and in full slushes
when you wear glasses like for
more attention to your eyes you know I
just felt like sometimes my makeup can
kind of get lost behind your glasses if
that makes sense so if you have some
lashes like a bit of boldness it's like
I'm still here I'm gonna go your for
these ones here because they're not like
super long but they still have quite a
bit of volume to them so they kind of
stand out right I'm gonna go apply these
lashes and I'll be back getting back and
my lashes are out and hopefully you guys
can kind of see what I mean when I say
it draws a little bit more attention to
your eyes because it just makes them a
little bit more bold I think if you
burlesque color on your eyes like less
my shadow you could totally get away of
just you know coating on that mascara
and just be done
luscious to me whether they're false
ones or mascara just like bring the look
together and then the eyeshadow just
kind of helps out that like depth and
color and shape so the two together just
works gonna finish off underneath my
eyes now just to sort of balance
everything out so I'm just gonna go back
in without them Browns
just lightly add some color under here
last thing to do so we want to keep the
underneath of the eye quite right in
opens to keep the heavy kind of colors
on top just because obviously glasses
the frames will kind of like shutter
around your eye so by adding the
brightness under here it will just still
keep your eye is like pop in pop it
taking any light shimmery gold color and
I'm just gonna pop that right in the
corner and as you can see like and then
just taking a nude color pencil and
popping that in at the waterline just to
open up the eyes even more hey its hutch
of mascara on the lower lashes to finish
so this is the eye makeup complete but
now it is time for the fun part I'm
basically gonna be showing you guys six
different frames that are different
shapes styles colors and I'm gonna be
pairing it with a lip color so you're
gonna get one entire look I'm about to
show you how versatile this eye look can
be so let's do this these glasses are
called the video net glasses I'm
obsessed with these there are a really
nice kaya shape which I love
I thought these frames would look so
bomb with a classic red lip because they
have a nice thin black frame the black
and the red story complement each other
so these are the glasses I'm trying to
show you guys without my softbox is like
glaring these are hands-down one of my
faves like how classy
do these look especially with that red
lip
to me these glasses are given more that
like officee vibe but do you do you boo
you wear them whenever a perfect shape
for this look as well because they go
out so you can see the wing of the
eyeshadow I love them
what zest these mixed classes are called
the Adrienne pair how flippin cool are
these with that like bold white frame
decided to go for a metallic gold lip I
think the gold obviously complements not
only the eye look but it really makes
the white on the glasses like pop okay
these are so cool and so different
definitely another favor keeping the
eyes and lips really bronzy and neutral
makes the white stand out and it's not
too much at all more of a square lens so
you'll pushed in a little bit more this
paper as soon as I turn to the side you
can still see that wing shape everything
fits in these are fab of gonna be
whipping these ones out you know it this
next pair is called Irene and how
amazing is the color of the frame they
say it's red on the website but it's
more that like burgundy I chose to pair
it with a brown lip now because we went
neutral on the eyes you can pair any lip
with these glasses and I decided to
stick to the color theme so you know
burgundy glasses burgundy lip I am just
loving the way my glass is much my
lipstick such an easy way to just pull
together a look I am loving the shape of
these frames these are more rectangle
than the other and a little bit bigger I
love how they're more like a maroon on
the front and they're more red on the
side I love that contrast this I should
have looked paired with this whole like
dark earthy makes everything look really
smoky and kind of sultry I'm a feeling
here I'm kind of living breathing and
dying for these yes another these Nick
glasses are actually a pair of branded
ones they are Chloe
glasses now I love the color of these I
think they're so unique there a clear
gray I decided to go for a peachy orange
lip with this I even think they would
look really good with a nude lip but I
kept it kind of beachy these are how
these ones look the shape of these are a
little bit more square but they kind of
come out in the outer corner here so you
can still see that like I make up what's
this the color of these frames are
really unique it's like a clear great I
think the peach and the gray actually go
really cute together what do you guys
think it's kind of hard to see the eye
makeup because of the glare but
as I said these ones are branded so they
are labeled Chloe is just written on the
side or right here oh well if my drink
in the background here okay I'm
definitely a probably here gonna butcher
the name of them I'm pretty sure it's
bana Haim or a naheem again I wanted to
coordinate my lipstick with the glasses
so I went with a grey blue lip color
because they're a color they're blue
again I think it just works
pairing like matching the colors these
glasses are actually a different shape
they are definitely a more rectangle
completely I also love the fact that the
arms of silver it just works with this
whole like cool toned thing we got going
on I know this is a really bold color
but trust me any of you can rock this
but is it just me or does it look a lot
more time now that I have the glasses to
match I actually feel like the glasses
are helping like wearing a bold lip do
you not I mean yeah I dig these these
are so cool so cool these glasses here
that I'm really cool sob aviator style I
went for a nice simple nude lip with
these glasses
nice big lens with a really really thin
gold frame so everything's really simple
here so I wanted to keep the lip nice
and simple these ones are so cute these
were my me off that popular geek chic
style that's been going around but these
are really good quality because they are
proper glasses I love the fact that
they're gold I feel like these ones even
though you can't get them as
prescription but I feel like these are
sort of their fashion glasses because
they just look really cool yeah these
ones are the style fin so that is it for
this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it adds so much fun like doing
makeup but in like a different way like
