brand new vid I was gonna say guess what
I've got for you today but like you
definitely already read the title
because you're on this video right now
so I have a huge Primark haul for you I
love myself a bit of primer
whenever I'm oh and there's a pie my
goal is just for myself in there and
they're actually thinking about it
always come out with like backs my bank
balance is like I actually have two bags
down here because I went to Primark on
two separate occasions if that's not
dedication I don't know what is I wait
wants come out with a bag full and then
I was watching other people's Prime my
calls and I was like what do I like I
have my eyes closed I should run home I
love holes they're just like an excuse
for these like why think it's part of
YouTube I actually feel like I've gotten
your little bit it's like some coops for
staff I'm excited why are your shoes
accessories a little bit of everything
so if you are curious know what power
mark is offering you guys know what to
do you know what to do keep watching I
don't even know where to start to be
honest you know what I think I'm just
gonna grab and show like my life is an
unorganized mess so it's fine
can we just okay right yeah anything I
can say right now oh this is so freaking
soft like it's not even funny it says
this black hoodie with a heard it's a
hoodie Jordan and it has like me all
like drawstring EE thingies has its laws
if detail at the front and then of
course there's like pockets this is the
snug little thing ever you guys I don't
think I'm gonna be taking this off
that's it now like mom you don't even
have to worry about my washing anymore
because I'm just basically gonna wear
this for the rest of my life I got mine
in an extra-large because I don't know
about you guys but when I wear hoodies I
like them to be sued by Versailles
because that's when they like comfy yeah
that's why going XL and I love the fear
of it comes like a really nice length I
feel like this was some like crop
leggings or something would look so cool
well as cool as I can look but like and
it was only 12 pounds I love her here
let me know I love it this is gonna keep
you so long like its legit perfect for
this time of year if you live in England
like me you know how cold it gets like
minus 20 I swear like I'm not freezing
my little titties off so with this I'm
gonna get on to the next all by the way
I'm actually just gonna say before I
forget my earrings actually from Primark
they like them little when I'm alive
don't do that I watch you rip my ears I
think I'd actually vom
you know them tassel
are going around at the moment I feel
like I'm seeing these everywhere I'll go
the black ones they did have them in red
as well and they were to pound you guys
to mother effing house oh my god looks
like a little Christmas tree everything
that's so cute look at them okay right
this print has been speaking to me now
before I show you this I do just want to
say this is like a little dungaree dress
and dungaree dress is dungarees that
kind of thing is not my style at all
I think it looks so fab on everybody
else but on me I just don't think it
really suits me but I saw this one in
this print and I was like you know what
I'm just gonna give it a go
isn't it cute though like I'm not gonna
lie it is this little don't you hate
these things anyway so it's just like a
little jungle dress kind of situation as
you can see then on the front that's
like a little sip Tito I don't know I
feel like this would look so cool with a
black high-neck long-sleeve top
underneath you know when you see
something you have like visions for in
your head and you're just like hoping
there looks alright that is me with this
let me tell you about this though okay
let me tell you there was so many on the
row and you know we see so many like my
size is 100 cent gonna be an F it's not
than like we need Jesus me my sister
we're looking we're looking so I was 14
sigh 16 so I was 12 so 12 so 12 and then
we come across the only six that was
there at that moment I just knew it was
like waiting there for me like this is a
size six and I'm normally a size eight
but like it's true and it was only
thirteen pounds I don't know I feel like
I'm gonna get a lot of wear out this I
love the prin will it suit me I don't
know will I try you bet your ass I will
oh my gosh okay right if I tell you to
tell me what this looks like
what would you say like this little bit
here doesn't it look like Gucci
I was shook you guys if you just take a
quick little glance at this that
honestly looks like Gucci and I have
been after a Gucci belt for the longest
time when I went to New York means
Sabrina we're looking in like the
airport you know because you can get
like money off and stuff they didn't
have the exact one I wanted that and
let's be real if you're gonna spend that
much money on a belt you're gonna want
the one that you want right I still
haven't really got around to getting
it's been it's like 200 quid for a bail
kind of hurts my soul a little bit like
just a little bit then I saw this one in
Primark three pounds I'm sorry
Primark providing the freakin goods are
gonna smile once
I am I threaten your own boy Henry VIII
I don't know and to be honest with you
is still a little bit big for me even
when I write around my hips it's still a
little bit big but what's cool is you
can just like pull it through
tuck the belt back in like this to
really keep it secure and it doesn't
move so I haven't had a puncture
puncture is that the right word put any
holes like extra holes in it which i
think is fab to be honest with you I
think this adds a little extra something
to your outfit see look how cute that is
not with this dress but oh my god you
know I just realized I've not got my
Invisalign in I just took them out to
have dinner swish you can't eat with
them in and I don't even put them back
you know I probably should put them back
in okay right can I just like say
something before we start I know I'm
really less be with them in I've not
even had them in for like a week yet so
I'm still getting used to them but yeah
finally have Invisalign I am so excited
to have straight teeth you guys don't
understand
oh yeah just so you know I'm gonna
soundless being a little bit different
now um but we were on with it we're
rolling with it look how fab this bag is
for real though it just looks so
expensive was it expensive no I think
we're like seven pounds
I loved it that much that I got it in
one second this mustard color here and
of course black I'm not gonna lie I'm
actually a little bit obsessed with them
this is like the perfect bag for me it's
the perfect size I can fit everything in
thine ear to my past my keys my phone my
toothbrush now live in the invisalign
life I love how it has a long strap you
know you can crossbody it just put on
the shoulder whatever you feel in is
velvet as well which I think makes it
look so expensive and I've seen designer
bags that legit look like this how cool
man it just makes me think like a ground
on a bag is seven pound in a bag from
Primark I'll let you guys do the math I
need because I'm really bad at maths
like I failed and gordy yeah yeah I am
like bagged out for life and I have like
a color to match like every single
outfit ever
I sound super lispy today and it's
actually annoying me away it's really
weird right one day I'll sound like not
lispy at all and the next unlike this
little bit of yellow if you've been here
a while you'll know that yellow is
honestly my favorite color I love it
look at this from Primark like Primark
you did this is this yellow suede like
biker style jacket so it's got like the
little belt around the waist I'm
actually obsessed with it there was so
many other colors as well there was I
was not see blue there wasn't blue from
what I saw anyway there was like a car
key or
read a ping I got the yellow cuz like I
said I'm obsessed I love how it were
like add a pop of color to any outfit as
well it's made so well to like so so
well unless you so impressed with the
quality if only Caparo my cup starts up
their game a little bit it was only 25
pounds as well I can see this in like
Topshop or something and it'll be double
the price thank me later I don't know
why but I've just kinda got the urge to
put this on right now right it's so
flippin nice I love it I love it love it
love it right okay so I've been looking
for you know a checks off shirt that you
can like pop over kind of looks really
like cash but kind of cool something
like this I can picture it with a little
white kind of cropped cami blue ripped
jeans some heels and this over the top
it's a look I'm feeling it this is
actually from the men's section I mean
it's the no surprise like I shop at the
men's section in places all the time I
love men's clothes I don't think people
realize there's a lot that you can do
with men's clothes I might even do a
men's clothing video if you wanted to do
some sort like men's clothing styling
video let me know because I think I'd
love to do that but only if you guys
want to see of course it just is kind of
fade it it's not too bright in in your
face which I really really love they
actually come with this t-shirt right
here they actually come up with it it
was attached I don't love it I also
don't hate it I probably wear it to bed
or something twelve pounds it was twelve
out for a shirt and a t-shirt like that
is so good oh this is kind of like
boring but like I picked up some of
these if you're interested you know the
little eye foot look soft
I basically wear these with my trainers
and stuff because I don't want my socks
are showing five purse for 2015 so
exciting oh I picked up these boots and
when it comes to like winter and stuff I
actually live in Boots and I love these
ones they're so cute I love the fact
they're that paid to shiny material one
because it looks fab and two because you
can like wipe them clean kind of like a
rounded kind of squared off rounded but
squared off like how can it be both get
it together done and they have a really
nice chunky heel as well little zip
design detail thing at the back like of
course you guys know about like it goes
with everything
I live in a size five if you're
wondering this it's my arm is my size
yeah fourteen pounds bugs they're so
well made as well all by the way also I
have tried them on they're really really
comfortable to walk in like listen I'm
all about wearing boots on an everyday
basis but if they're not comfortable I
can't but these jÃ¶rgen though I love
loungewear like I actually living it
I think 99% of the time I'm actually in
comfy clothes like even right now you
guys put it on our butt like Jordan
you're wearing this I still wear joggers
I swear this is like every youtuber ever
though like let's be real so saying now
I picked up a couple of loungewear bits
from Primark this one first of all it is
so soft so just these pair of turkeys
like this they aren't super skinny I've
got pairs of truck seat bottoms a
skinnier but that's still cute it looks
pretty big when I hold it up on camera
like this but these pull in so you know
you can really pull it in at the waist
I'm then it has this little matching
hoodie like this to go with a small
little cropped hoodie I don't normally
like things with like quote some kind of
slogan stuff on but because you can't
really read that I love the fact this is
cropped I think it is more flattering
just a cute little comfy cord so it's
like it's comfy but because it matches
like you could totally wear this out you
know like loungewear out where like this
is what that reminds me off it just like
ticks all the boxes for me
I love cords I love being comfy I love
having like something cropped with
tracky bottoms the bottoms I got in a
small what they were eight pounds and
the top I've gotten a extra small and
that was eight pounds as well so what's
that sixteen pounds anyway this is comfy
this is cute and then because I like
being comfy so much I picked up another
set but in a pink camo anything camera
I'm such a sucker for it's a pretty
similar concept to the last one so
you've got some tracky bottoms here as
you can see actually can you see it
because like it's coming right when I
first saw you sounds like that it's
gonna be way too big for me these or as
small as well but again they have a
drawstring at waist you know put
everything in and then the top looks a
little something like this
so as you can see it has this little
drawstring thing here but don't be
fooled you guys this is all fake it was
all fake I thought
gonna be like pull me in but it just
doesn't now before I do this I wanted to
show you it like as it is but I'm gonna
be cropping this into more of a crop
because it's it's really really weirdly
it like meets the trousers and it just
looks like it's just not that flowering
so I feel like if I crop it it's you
know you have a little bit of skin
showing it will look so much better like
more my style what is this a little baby
sticker top is in a small 8 pound for
the top 8 pound for the bottoms 16
pounds love myself a little car warden
if it can be comfy speaking of a camo I
got this little beanie cause you from
the men's section where air freshener
it's such good quality like it's so like
thick deep cough Feeny Primark one size
it was three pounds I actually said this
in a blog but if you're looking for a
beanie go to Primark they have the cute
is no beanies ever I've got a few more
here to show you but how cool is this oh
my gosh enough this is a good idea I'm
probably gonna like make my hair go
mental like a smurf okay this is cute
this is cute this is a little bit of me
you know actually this is a little bit
sorry I don't have the biggest head ever
or maybe this is telling me I have a big
head maybe I do have a big head I don't
know I actually love it though can we
just
does this not melt your heart is this
just not the cutest thing ever I will
assume I Drive with me it was free pound
from Promark as well look there's this
one I don't know if you can see the
bubble it kind of just like blends in
with the background it's just like a
little white fluffy pom-pom look how
fluffy is as well this one was two
pounds this one which is actually one of
my faves I'm obsessed with the color of
this eye that baby blue this one was 2
pounds again like how good is that for
like a pom pom beanie that's so good and
have a great one but this one has like a
dark pom-pom in stead again 2 pounds I'm
gonna have like the biggest hair off
this more of the story you need a beanie
Primark as where is that last couple of
things now some I'm just going to show
you these really quickly because
honestly there's white leggings they're
kind of cropped kind of not I really
really wanted some white leggings to
kind of like go underneath that large
hoodies and stuff you know that kind of
look I've got a minute 8 they were 2
pounds but keeping it real with you guys
they are see for
it's not like the worst thing I've ever
seen in my life but the only reason why
I still got them was because I'd wear
hoodies that will cover my bum so it
really doesn't matter anyway but yeah
I'm not saying I recommend them I'm just
saying you know I got them pop oh and
they were only two pounds so I was like
you know what Fe let's just do it have
some more little booties these are so
what corner for like these are gonna be
a bit like Marmite you're either gonna
love it or you're gonna hate it I love
them I think they are so edgy something
a little bit different I don't have any
blue well navy blue suede velvet sort of
shoes they actually look super blue on
camera but I think it's because I got
like two huge bright lights in front of
me they are definitely more of like a
navy blue in real life my kind of style
of boot nice and soft unki has a little
platform with a chunky heel a super
comfortable
I actually saw his down with these I got
I'm gonna fall because the five were
like way too big for some reason now the
main reason I got them is because they
were actually like the sale part now
I've been to a few pry marks and they
have been in all the primary I've been
to so I feel like it could be you know
easier to get hold of these were six
pounds mic drop
should I say boot drop I just couldn't
pass them up like I can't wait to start
them I actually think they're gonna go
with more than what people think it
probably is the bargain of the whole
actually yeah and the very very last
thing I'm just gonna really quickly show
youso Primack have a bunch of underwear
that's on sale I actually do really
really like Prime I kinda have not seen
anything that I love recently I am more
like a bar venue and the summer's like
that kind of style of underwear
I love underwear I love wearing
underwear for me like just to feel like
no it's sexy you know like as a woman
and because I love underwear I take
pride in it does that make sense
I don't know I just love putting on like
a matching set of underwear it makes me
feel good anyway that went off for like
a little tangent basically a problem I
do have some sale ones going on and I do
like Primark for they're more like comfy
underwear you know when you're just like
throwing when you're Chilean see and
this is the little set that I got I love
the color like the baby
blue guys it was two pounds for a little
matching set like that's so good roll it
top no padding no nothing and then it is
a little like thong underwear which
that's what I'm about the only thing I
don't like about the underwear I think
it's too like hovered at the front for
me covered is that the right word it's
basically I just like a different style
of underwear but like I said to just
like throw this on when I'm at
home this little ball it would be super
cute under like some tops and stuff as
well you know off the shoulder stuff
yeah that is my Primark all complete I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I love whole videos so much hopefully
you've seen some bits that you might
want to like after your little
collection anyways everything from me
