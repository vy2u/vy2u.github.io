doing I hope you're all doing sub
today's video I'm just so stoked about
because it's a hair video and basically
this video is some of my fav hairstyles
some of my go-to is basically just hair
cells that I love and I wanted to put
them all into one little video for you
guys I wanted to a switch up a little
bit as well and do something that I've
not done on my channel yet so it's a
heavier but some of these hairstyles
include a accessories we've got like a
bunch on our ribbon hair rings there's a
lot so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video and let's get into the first
of this hairstyle if giving me total
Rihanna vibes and I'm loving it so what
we want to do is take your bad data and
pull it in half to create a triangle
shape pop I know you'd like this take me
to em and tie it in a knot other back it
is dead simple then I'm going to go
ahead and fit my kite in one and start
curling my hair tied up to you how you
wanna start your hair curly straight
user you now I'm taking a teeth and
brush you can use a comb or a brush and
I'm just pushing up on the head add more
volume and texture and that is this
hairstyle complete
the next hairstyle is a little opponent
so I'm just and by leaving bits of hair
around my face to frame it gathering my
hair up into a high pony and the key to
this look is actually one of these this
is a hair bungee I will leave in the
description box below this is the key
for the volume and at the bounce so
there's a whole new brent start by
soaking one of the ends in keep wrapping
it around your hair to get it as tight
as you can and then you just hook the
other end in like that and as you can
see you already have so much bounce in
your hair then I'm going to go and pull
out the top besides everywhere add more
volume around my head
and then I'm also going to pull out some
more bits around the sides because why
not then I'm at grabbing my curling wand
in style to care what bits of my hair a
little tip for you guys curl your hair
when it's already up in the half dollar
just like I'm doing here it is way
quicker and away easier to keep the
volume in all day hon what you want to
do is take the top section of the
ponytail clip up out the way up for a
sec start piecing this underneath
section then you want to grab this
section and pinch it push it up and grip
it I will repeat that so you can see so
you pinch it push up and grip it this is
going to create a little bubble for the
hair on top to sit on and as you can see
it looks a lot bigger now for the
bandana
to do so start by just rolling this in a
sort of long flat shape all the way feel
at the end and then I take this behind
my head like this and just tie up in a
knot at the top but what I do is I tied
up in one knot just like this and then I
go ahead and repeat that just so the
little bits are shorter and that is
literally how you do so
this one is a little bit fiddly but keep
practicing it you can do it you want to
start by sectioning off a section in the
middle of your head from the front all
the way down to the nape of your neck
I use the beginning of my eyebrows as a
guide for thickness by the way they will
wet this section to make it easier
because we're going to do a little
braids or Dutch braid so how you do this
take a look section and divide it into
three like I'm doing here take the
strands underneath each are about three
times just like a regular braid and then
this is where get a little bit more
difficult so the outer section I'm doing
here adding gen√®ve to it and putting it
underneath the middle strand so it
becomes the middle and then you repeat
that on the other side I will zoom in
here so you can see so on your left
adding hair to that strand taking it
underneath the middle so then it becomes
the middle strand then I'm giving it a
little tug just to keep it nice and
tight and now as you can see on your
right I'm repeating that again and then
you just do that down the whole section
so right left right left add hair to get
underneath the middle strand you want to
braid all the way down to the end of the
hair and then it just tie it off I'm
using a hair bumper and little elastics
would be way better then it's all about
just sectioning and braiding I think I
just three either side of that middle
braid that we did in the beginning not
gonna lie though hands this is an all my
other half Alice very time-consuming but
it's totally worth it over to this
hairstyle will last in your hair a
really long time what I will say though
is practice Dutch braiding starts before
you go straight to the test aisle this
is a little bit more complicated because
they are so small but just keep
practicing normally you can do it I
believe in you and that is it for this
crystal
this one has to be a favor it is a sleek
hire buns I thought by gathering up my
hair at the top of my head
take my teasing brush this one is from
ght by the way in case you're wondering
I just use that to smooth out my hair so
the top and the underneath of my hair
taking my hair back I'm going to try and
get my hair as tight as I can in a
ponytail just so everything stays really
nice and like slicked back the whole day
holding my hair up like this the
military my teasing brush and start
teasing the back just add some volume
gonna make our life way easier when it
comes to forming the bun and how I do
that is I just start wrapping it around
the base of the pony keep messing with
it just to get it how you want it and
then when you have done that take a
little bobby pin and just pin that or in
place final step I'm taking this to HD
finish in serum you can use hairspray
and I'm just going to smooth over my
flyways to tame them down and that is it
now what to do a little hair Rosie so
I'm going to start by putting a middle
parting in my hair and then I'm going to
grab this off side top section as you
can see and clip it up and then I do the
same for the back and the opposite side
this really doesn't have to be neat at
all just rough sort of grubbing rough
chunks of hair and clipping them up and
I'm going to take down the section I did
in the beginning divide that into three
and really loosely just braid the hair
it doesn't have to be kind of neat or
anything just really loose because we
are going to pull the crap out of it in
a second and then of course when I get
to the bottom I'm just going to tie off
a hair elastic would be better I just
didn't have one and then I do that to
all three sections as you can see I now
have three braids and then like I said
I'm going to go in and pull the crap out
of the braids all three of them don't
have to be neat with this in fact though
kind of while you really wanted to look
on even and super messy to a format the
roses as you can see I'm just and to rub
the hair around itself kind of like you
would do if you were doing little buns
and then when you've done that take a
bobby pin and pin it all the way through
the rows just to make sure it stays
stuck to your head and then you want to
go ahead and repeat that on the other
two braids as well the easiest way to do
this by the way is if you have a mirror
behind you because you can kind of see
where you're placing everything and
pinning things and make sure the road is
sort of all in a line
for the front sections and then I starts
or grabbing and twisting hair together
as I go then I'm going to start pulling
and tugging out that to make it a little
bit Messier and bigger taking a little
clip like this I'm going to pin that at
the back just underneath the roses and
then of course you want to go ahead and
repeat the exact same thing on the other
side and that is it that is how I do
this test our
this next one includes herrings it's
something a little bit edgy so I'm gonna
start by making a deep sigh part in my
hair and the side that I'm holding hair
on now I'm going to start to Dutch braid
this not going to go too much into it
because I did show you how to Dutch
braid earlier and you can kind of see
I'm doing but just adding hair to an
outer strand taking it underneath the
middle to make it the middle strand and
repeat that on at the other side and I'm
going to keep doing that all the way
down until you get to the end of your
ear here and you're just going to stop
Dutch braiding and go ahead and do a
regular braid when you've done that just
a tie off like normal and now it is time
to add in the hair ring so they are
super easy to put in you just want to go
ahead and open them up a little bit so
there's a bit of a gap and just wiggle
them into the braid of course you can
add as many as you want put them where
you want are kind of sporadic with them
and now I'm taking my curling wand and
start to curl a bit of my hair again
turn up to you how you want to style
your hair straight curly whatever you
would prefer and that is it
start ASL to Dutch braids of ribbon go
ahead and divide your hands of two and
tie one side off take a front section
like this divide it into three take me a
middle strand and tie the ribbon onto
that middle strand and then as you can
see you now have the ribbon included in
it so it's like this part the section
now start Dutch braiding your hair this
mu Dutch braid in this video so just
regular braid the hair like this I have
to one of the outer strands cross it
underneath the middle to make it the
middle and repeat on the other side and
you just want to keep going on both
sides
that's what you wanna you wanna
then I go in and just stop pulling at
the braids to make them a lot looser and
bigger I do this to both sides you can
put out as much as you like or you can
leave it's really up to you but I like
the look quite big braids
pull out bits of hair to frame your face
and that is it thank you guys so much
