that time of year where the Sun started
to come out start to shine but for a
make art B it's like hell no one of
those situations where I make up here at
the beginning of the day tell me
somewhere the end the sun legit just
like melt my face off so I'm going to do
a quick and easy yet still pretty glam
summer makeup store for you guys but I
really want to use products that I trust
I know that lasts well on the skin
especially like under heat and stuff I
guess what sticks likely what I did it
is the makeup that I'm wearing it now so
it's just really glowy and bronzed skin
a bright red lip when I think of some
ass this this kind of thing so I think
also if you guys want to know how to do
this like 10 15 minute Graham yet long
lasting makeup look singing you watch
integrase oh I look like an egg right
now but I mean 3 so I'm going to start
by doing speed brows because they need
some help I'm using the LOC London arch
rival brow artist retractable eyebrow
pencil in medium oh I wasn't no no
impressive for our pencils go I ever
like to use this or the L'Oreal expert
one but this one has like a fine a nib
so I can create like more fine art brow
strokes so my browser cut it a bit more
natural I do really like this bad so
it's also got a spray on you so I can
brush through my eyebrows it's just
really good it actually is surprisingly
quick as well even though it's so fine I
can fill my brows real quick only thing
is though is a find that you have to set
it to the brow gel otherwise it kind of
like whoo smear a little bit and then
like Haza through the down half my
eyebrow best things about that is to be
easy do with my benefit gimme brow this
will cling onto your brow hair so make
sure I roll all kind of Harry Harry and
it will set them in place so they won't
move which is what we need on those hot
you know I know my brows look hella
crazy right now have really dark with my
hair but once I have the rest of my face
on it kind of bends in a bit oh my god
okay so when it comes to making our
makeup last and having that kind of
shine free face this is what you need
like when how I doing without you I mean
all your skin kind of girl so my makeup
tends to like want to leave my face like
halfway through the day but this has
changed the game this is the body shop
insta map so basically this must advise
your face your foundation and your
lipsticks even if you have dry skin and
you like to wear like matte lips and
stuff you will still love this you can
still use it basically what you can do
with this is you can write like bare
skin you can alone
and you can wear it underneath makeups
and mustafar you can mix it into your
foundations kind of information that's
do relooking I guess you can even make
your lipstick matte with this like this
is that like a micro be like taking it
with me it's just like a silicon eat gel
what I like to do is put it on the
makeup or not my t-zone so you guys can
see you see that shine on my forehead I
put this on there hopefully you can see
how much my forehead is now I just put
this in my t-zone area because that's
where these oils like to come through
and where it's like silicone II it feels
like it's filling in my pores at the
same time like priming my skin see you
like the outside my face is glory but
the middle is like a matte which is why
I want anyone with oily skin or if you
like to make things about anything this
is a summer staple you need I'm going to
just refresh my skin with a little bit
of mac's fix+ because you can't go wrong
with a bit of a fix time
okay oh my god that was so freaky my
foundation I really like the summertime
is the clinic beyond that rumor was that
even English
I really like the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer now
why I like this to the summer is because
it holds up like it lasts a really long
time at first I thought this would be a
little bit too heavy for the summer time
but you only need a small amount of this
it feels lightweight on the skin like I
can't feel it has really really good
coverage and it holds up well I just use
my body blender to the net gain the
coverage of this is honestly insane like
I didn't even put that much
on Eva and the finish is like really
glowy which is like perfect for the
summer I feel like it's so hard to
finance our nation that's like glowy but
laughs on the skin and this one does
that
which is why for me what I want to go a
little glam in the summertime this works
perfectly just think we'll often do it
I want people that can sit have like
five minute strangers like okay stop
don't stop
draw a blender come back if you
concealer I'm using you probably guessed
it is the a Maybelline fit me I really
love this because it's really really
lightweight but it has really good
coverage all the products I use for the
summer though I like the lightweight
weather they do what they're supposed to
is that make sense that you can
literally trap them on your face and
like be done which is why I'm calling
this like a quick summer glam look
because they're really easy to use you
can make sure you shut them on your face
and go pounces and this is really nice
and jewelry looking but if I didn't set
this with my skin type but oh girl I
would literally end up with like a
freaking hot mess like thank you if I'm
taking some of the benefit Porefessional
lt0 shine shine foundation powder which
is what I need and then with a big
fluffy brush this of the spectrum either
one I've been loving these spectrum
brushes by the way it's going to lightly
set my skin nothing too crazy though
because I still want to keep that like
shine but I have to set it so that
powder products blend nicely on top and
a goal growth and money this will also
help on makeup lasts way longer as well
so although this foundation looks so
good even if I do see some results I
just can't see it on my skin like it
just melts in rather than sit results
and underneath my eyes as well with that
powder just so we don't increasing and
by the way that body shop product
everywhere I've put it my skin looks so
smooth it always makes it look so like
to why my skin I'm using the makeup
forever Pro bronzed fusion in do I don't
know right now but I will leave it
linked below this ones are so nice
because it kind of has like a glow to it
with a clean natural on the skin I'm
just going to take that fit around the
perimeters on my space to really warm up
my complexion make it look more Sun kit
but this one's got that shine to it it
looks like your skin kind of like shine
through it so it makes it look really
natural this is a workout for my own
they're not going to like this blend in
business the limey if you guys know
about coming underneath because
which in likes to come out sometime this
one's is really nice and buildable as
well so you don't have to worry about it
listen grazing on my brush I'm taking
this MUA one in the color called lolly
it's just a really cute like bull this
is really cute like peachy color I like
taking a sip in brush because this
applies it kind of evenly and it doesn't
apply too much
IVA the stuff is really nice you know
this is like the good pigmentation look
at me coming out over the words a
pigmented what next I'm hoping you guys
can see that everything looks really
glowy except like my t-zone area which
is exactly why one now I can hardly call
this a summer glowy bronzy skin makeup
look singing mobile in here without the
glow right I'm going to use the body
shop honey bronze like highlighting and
zero and I'm basically going to put this
in the places where I don't want my
highlighter to be as intense so like my
nose my Cupid's bow maybe like the tops
of my eyebrows here and then I'm going
to leave the more intense highlighter
for to my cheekbones from windows hope
you guys can see it just gives us a nice
subtle color glow
I feel like we're doing this but add in
the more intense one of my cheekbones it
gives my face like was I mentioned I
don't know it's like different levels of
boy you could literally just use this
though like honestly this gives enough
but you know an extra are going in with
you make up whatever Pro it like a
fusion highlighter which hello
this stuff is intense and of its going
to pounce that in the sponge just to
make sure there's no line for anything I
love how it glowy and during my skin is
right now but the amazing thing is
they're all powder products and they're
going to last way longer on the skin
especially in the heat and they're
already amazing products anyway okay so
oh my god please my voice no my camp you
know something I'm not sure so the eyes
are really simple I used to eyeshadow
colors and that is literally it so I'm
offering this makeup geek eyeshadow in
the color Morocco and I'm going to go in
needle - I'm going to tap in really
really lightly because today I mean the
pigment it's going to work that into the
crease like
in those circular motion so we're going
to be kind of clever with this and use
this other transition color a lapras
color so by starting off with a really
really small amount the color will be
same class so it can be our transition
and then you're going with a little bit
more into the crease and it looks like a
kind of a different color just like my
idea anyway this ishow look is really
easy to do as well as you don't have to
be me at all don't look at me I like to
learn everywhere go in with a teeny bit
more and just put that more in the
crease like right there so the letters I
was like a shimmering copper color so
I'm taking this over a signature
eyeshadow put it in radiant eyes and I'm
going to be taking a mixture of like
this red color here and the gold and
just going to pack that onto my layers
these eyeshadows re nice like look it's
creamy almost like a little sunset I'm
literally just packing it onto the lid
like this giving it a quick blend into
the crease to blend the two colors
together and that's it I want this to be
like quick and easy summer glam you know
okay now this next step is totally your
choice on what you want to do it's what
you find quickest and easiest I know a
lot of you farm just putting on mascara
like quick easy done you can go I'm
going to apply falsies because I'm so
used to apply and then I want to
actually find them quicker to do then
like coating on mascara so I'm going to
do collections for me are just so much
more easier to apply you know what I
like as well as while I'm waiting for my
lash glue to dry
I feel like to another part of my makeup
or something like my lips or my
relatives I just do them now you can
wear whatever lipstick color you want
with this I think I'm going to go for a
red because whenever I think of summer
makeup I always think of like a nice
bright red lipstick I don't know why I
just do tips to make your lipstick last
longer because you don't actually have
to wear a liquid lipsticks to make your
lips laughter that makes sense because
sometimes they can dry my lips a little
bit line and fill in your lips with a
lip liner this one is the NYX suede
matte lip liner in it kitten heels can
outline these
we're doing this work crease like a base
for your lipstick so when your lipstick
starts to fade you'll still have the lip
liner underneath so it makes it seem
like your lipstick still there
hey Owen why did you just realize I
didn't tell you what lashes I'm wearing
and these are actually from Primark
crazy right I think the brand was called
like su OS or something like that the
packaging black silver then it for my
main lipstick I'm using the Maybelline
vivid matte liquid in a 25 or in short
this is amazing like orange e red so my
teeth a lot not now even though this is
technically a liquid lipstick it doesn't
drive down like wine like it's not super
super matte which I really like because
it's more hydrating like this it does
try not achieve it more than this it's
not as glossy looking I quite like the
finish of this with this look kind of
all glossy and glowy but I really want
to show you how the body shop insta map
works like I said you can use this on
lipstick so if you like more of a matte
lip but like this sort of formula you
can use this to change it I'll show you
you ready like oh my god can you guys
see that
it's like instantly map and then of
course the very last thing at setting
spray we are definitely going to need
this in the summer if you want our
makeup to stay on our face it is texted
me I have been obsessed with this one if
the people who shot makeup settings but
really just like the locks everything in
I put aloe vera rinse it's super
refreshing and like hydrating give it a
little shakey shake yes this is going to
sound really strange right but the spray
on this setting spray is really nice
it's not like too light of a Miss but
it's not too strong of a nest
it's like in-between so when you spray
you get like a boost of like freshness
just take a little bag with a couple
bits in especially in the summer to do a
little touch-up so always take my
settings by a just as a little boost for
freshness and then there I'm of course
take the lipstick that I'm wearing and
then my instrument as well so I can kind
of mess apply my lips or even mustafar
like my skin anywhere that I need and
then I might take like a press power
or something with me just in case but
that is literally it so I'll put this in
my back and then I'll be good to go so
this is be completed somewhere makeup
look I feel like this is a look you know
this is definitely going to be my go to
