forget to smash that thumbs up and if
you aren't subscribed already don't
forget to subscribe a while hit by hey
guys so this is my typical evening
routine because I work from home usually
at this point I would have finished
filming and I just loved to remove my
makeup now I do actually have a make
removal and skincare routine already up
on my channel I believe that in the
description box below if you are
interested in seeing how I look after my
skin and then I love to just jump in the
shower having a shower I think is like
one of the most relaxing and best thing
ever so I will just wash my hair with
the provoke touch of silver shampoo and
conditioner this is so good if you have
blond hair because it just keeps all of
the brassiness away
I use this body shop to scrub in oil
this is basically a hydrating exfoliant
for your skin now because I wear fake
tan all the time this just really helps
to keep my fake tan in a really nice
condition and then all my god you guys
this Ranger this is the body shop almond
milk and honey shower cream now this is
amazing if you have sensitive or dry
skin because it's so so soothing because
it's totally soap free so it's so gentle
on your skin and it also smells
incredible and now because I love it so
much when I'm at the shower I use
another product from that range and this
is the almond milk and honey body butter
this is basically just a really really
thick moisturizer now what I love most
about this not only it does it really
hydrate your skin you're left with no
sticky residue whatsoever your skin that
she will just soak it up and honestly
I'm left with this softest skin I love
it
and then once I finished in the shower
just like so up into some comfy clothes
for like trackies and oversized talk and
some comfy socks is my thing literally
living track is one of our home and then
I like to go ahead and just pull out my
hair straight away because otherwise if
I don't blow dry it it kind of goes
crazy so I just like to do my usual
routine so that she's putting a couple
pumps of oil in my hair and then I just
go ahead and joy
and then at once I have finished
blow-drying on my hair I just like to
head downstairs and make myself a drink
now usually it's a pee or a coffee I
went for tea today now when I make my
tea I'm like a - sugar kind of go what
about you guys
now usually at this point in the evening
I still have a little bit of work and
bit to catch up on so I'll just head
back upstairs to my room and I'll just
scroll through my social media and so my
Instagram Twitter snapchat all of that
and then probably watch a little bit of
YouTube as well because I just get
distracted
and then this is the point where I
realized I probably should get on it and
do some work so I will just go ahead and
reply to any emails that I have and then
I do some editing and bits like that
this video that I'm editing right now
you will see very very soon and then
food now this particular evening I did
actually order myself a pizza which
obviously I don't do that often at all
about I mean I love pizza or who else
loves pizza
and then after food I which you just
like to chill out wind down like have a
little bit of me time because usually
I've been working pretty much the entire
day so I'll just hop into bed just
double check that there's nothing else
that I have to do and then I'll just
reply to any messages that I have and
then just watch a bit of YouTube
that is my realistic evening routine you
guys I hope that you did enjoy if you
can ever get to smash that thumbs up and
subscribe if you aren't already thank

this video I love you guys and I'll see
