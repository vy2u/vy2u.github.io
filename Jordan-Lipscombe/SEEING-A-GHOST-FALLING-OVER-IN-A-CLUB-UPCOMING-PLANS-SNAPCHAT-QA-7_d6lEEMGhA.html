filming a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A today I asked you
guys of course to send me in your
questions and I asked if they could be a
little bit more personal I guess and a
bit different rather than just things
about like my hair my makeup all of that
kind of outside the whole like YouTube
thing more about me more kind of like it
gets to know me I guess so I'm excited
to see what you guys have asked me I
will of course try and answer as many as
I can obviously it's gonna be hard to
answer every single one because there
are so many but any that I don't answer
on camera I will try to like message you
personally um but let's just get into it
I got to sleep pretty do you know what
um I have thought about vlogging however
I don't know if my life is interesting
enough and now it's all silly like you
guys are probably like Jordan you go to
like events and stuff has always had a
kind of vlog I guess on my snapchat but
I just don't know if my life is
interesting enough to vlog it like so
many of you with us if I'm doing a vlog
mister share and at the moment I'm not
um but is that something you guys would
one or would you just want more kind of
like main channel videos I don't know
let me know down below what you guys
would be most interested in so I say
that I'm not appropriate like I like tea
crumpets or now what do you say that you
want to like I do love a good cup of tea
I'm not gonna lie half tough sugar in it
I too may be free when I'm passionate
when I'm feeling a bit risque yes do you
love a good copper featured in for the
third time now what is the most
embarrassing thing that's ever happened
to you love you love you I don't really
know it's kind of a hard one because
funnily enough I don't actually really
get embarrassed I just know I kind of go
but I mean probably one recently
I am fellow though miles that carb in
that was so embarrassing like when I
fall over I just sort of laugh and get
on with it but this was in front of like
a bunch of old school friends like
mixture of boys and girls and it was
just so embarrassed about you're
speaking to an old school friend that I
hadn't spoke to an ages and only get
kind of nervous anyway speaking to
someone that you haven't spoken to in a
while I don't know
and then like a massive group of old
school friends I come over I say school
friends like we didn't really speak in
school but there were people that I knew
come over and join them at that point I
kind of felt a bit awkward so I walked
away and you know when you like say bye
to someone you like all right I'll see
you later I'll see you around sort of
thing and you walk away and yeah pretty
confident walking away didn't see there
was like a bunch of I'll call on the
floor and I just slipped straight over
and I mean when I fell over I mean I was
basically laying down all saw me most
embarrassing part is I went to stand
back up and I fell over again I slipped
back on my bar and I let you as soon as
I got to straight back up I ran away
like thinking about it now it was funny
but oh my god oh I can't I cringed so
much you know when you don't even want
to if I could have any superpower what
would it be
Joba I mean that's like the typical ones
of like being invisible and being able
to fly and things like that but I feel
like if I could work out when I was
sleeping like how good of a superpower
would that be
I could literally be asleep and work off
those calories like work off those
Doritos yes please
that was my friend bothering shout-out
to you I love you um so my celebrity
crush would probably be Eva Zac Efron or
Jay from taboo fixes I don't know if
you've ever seen in B's and they're my
favorite thing about Christmas I just
love like the whole vibe of Christmas
like the lights and the decorations like
I'm so excited to film Christmas videos
you don't understand you
we're in a zombie apocalypse huh how
many days weeks months whatever long did
you live I have been watching that The
Walking Dead
I've been watching Rick and ro like I
know what to do I feel like you guys are
probably think I'd like die in the first
day but on a certain think I'd be pretty
good like even if I do say so myself
what's the best feature you like in a
game the most other than his personality
like his face his body I love you oh I
love you other than his personality
she's okay I would definitely say his
face like a guy's eyes and like like I
like like brunettes um maybe like a bit
of stubble that's kind of my kind of
thing I'm into that so you don't
obviously have to like I'm not like
picky I don't have a type but I'm just
instantly attracted to that you know I
couldn't think of any like weird
question but I wanted to ask you
something how's your relationship with
your mom
oh my god that's such a cute question
yeah me my mother has an amazing
relationship I'm so lucky to have such
an amazing mom honestly um you guys have
probably seen her a few times because I
do post on my snapchat but no she's an
amazing woman and she's like probably
one of my biggest inspirations in life
because she's done like so much that I
look up to and yeah have you ma'am hi
I'm online and I what is the weirdest
things runners ever said to you I've had
someone ask if I could send a picture of
my feet to them before like I know
people have foot fetishes but like yeah
that's probably like the weirdest thing
I joined thanks to recant my so this
like a couple of things I guess I love
to do they're quite like different it
depends on my mood that's why if I love
going out and see my friends whether we
go clubbing or like go for dinner or
anything like that or I love to just
literally sit home watch YouTube watch
The Walking Dead
because Walking Dead is my jam to eat
until a nap oh I see all the exciting
stuff behind the scenes trust me I'm
just I'm just a normal girl that likes
to eat your sacred I am a girl future
teach you to live or anything else
hopefully my youtube you like take off
me in the sense of maybe doing something
really really really exciting but we'll
say yeah but for now the only pants I
really have is I'm going to like my
first meetup I guess I'm going to
beautycon this year which is so exciting
I'm going this weekend actually which is
December 3rd who's going it's the London
beautycon
let me know if you're going there is
more details on my Instagram by the way
if you want to know I'm doing a little
kind of meet up with um Beauty Bay which
should be so fun and then I'm sort of
hanging around and doing my own thing so
if you guys are around the area and you
do want to come say hey feel free hi I
wanted to ask
a chance to do over something in life
what would you do differently thank you
for your question and I love you too so
I would say to my younger self like
don't be so afraid or like ashamed of
who I was like basically you might not
know this about me but I was believed
when I was in school um and I mean it
was a really hard time obviously I've
come out better from it I guess you
could say if you do want a video I was
thinking of making a video on it I know
I was going to do this advice series so
if you buyers almost a video about like
school and billion and friends and
things like that
let me know um but yes I would just say
to her like don't worry about what
people think of you like don't give a
about what people think about you
because that's a huge that was a huge
deal to me when I was younger I cared a
lot about pleasing people affected me so
much so yeah I would just tell myself to
just stop being so afraid what would you
do success comes to Australia I live in
history and love myself I love your
accent
I love the Australian accent I think
it's so cool what would I do when I
first go to Australia come and see you
my Christian should be 51 and what would
it be
wife you know what this is really
strange because I have a fear of the
ocean I hate anything like that but I'd
be an animal that kind of lives in the
ocean I would love to be a sea horse I
just think they're just so pretty to
look at they're just so oh I love them
but they're just so magical a Jonin
instead of knowing what your favorite
food is I want to know what your least
favorite food is by the way your accent
is so sick holy cow
cake is probably my least favorite food
it's just like really sickly I just
don't
mmm thank you but really at any wait
habits and if you do I think about stuff
in the many times day or something a
prayer
I used to oh my god this used to be so
bad I used to have really bad like
paranoia no joke my sister will vouch
for this basically am i used to like
when I went downstairs say at night you
get a drink or get something from the
fridge when I come I would literally
stand there by the way for about no
exaggeration like at least a couple
minutes just either pushing the fridge
door closed or like making sure the taps
turned off I would then come upstairs
lay in bed and I'd go did I turn it off
it's a fresh door closed like I'd be so
paranoid that I didn't turn it off I'd
have to go get my sister to go check for
me and be like Jordan you have I also do
something what my mom calls like it's
like a horse noise it's what she says I
don't like no good yeah I basically make
this clicking noise we're gonna let
don't even realize I'm doing it my mom
says it's like I'm calling my horse or
it sounds like a horse's feet would you
marry me this question is a really good
one it's from cyd toxic squid I think
that's how you say your name do you have
any ghost experiences if so what's the
scariest one now I have had like a
couple weird freaky things happen to me
I don't know if I believe in ghosts or
not I'm still like underside last one it
was a few years back and I was laying in
bed sleeping um and I don't know if you
guys have felt this but you know when
you someone's in the room you can sense
when someone's in the room you can sense
when someone's looking at you well I was
like half awake half asleep and I could
sense like eyes on me so we're distinct
I was laying like this not opened up my
eyes and to the side of me I'm not
kidding was my mum my two sisters and
another little girl wasn't me it was
just another little girl next to them
and they were all in high order as well
I'm actually getting goose bumps talking
about this so cool and they were just
like looking at me and I blinked a
couple of times and they were still
there and then I blinked like really
hard and they just went they'd gone but
I thought it was my imagination but the
fact that I sensed so much that someone
was looking at me so we're the next one
anyway because like me my family joke
rises like a ghost in the house like but
I genuinely think that actually could be
because some weird stuff happened so
this was a couple years ago it's back
when I had my prom in school
and I remember it because it was my prom
dress that it happened with so basically
I hung my prom dress on the outside of
my wardrobe but you know when you open
the door and you hang on the top of the
dawn and you close the Wardrobe door so
it's secure it's not going to like slip
down or fall off only a pharmacy someone
opens the door or takes off you know and
I'd come in from school so no one had
been in all day my parents were at work
my sisters were out doing their own
thing
and I had come in and I come upstairs to
my room and my prom dress was like on
the floor and the hanger was like out of
the prom dress next to it like and it
wasn't like a wide shoulder prom dress I
actually had like one that come right up
by my neck here and it was had like
sleeves and stuff and so there was no
way that that would have come off unless
you take it out off the hanger and it
was just laying on the floor like and I
checked that no one had been high at
MoMA it's like no no one's been home I
don't ever have my windows open so the
wind could have blown it because I hate
ever made my window open so yeah that
was weird so they all the questions that
I'm going to answer in this video
remember to let me know down below about
kind of the advice videos and also rug
moose or any kind of videos that you
