the full face of makeup that I'm wearing
so I take some cotton buds and some
coconut oil coconut oil is my favorite
way to remove all of my makeup and I
start by running some of this along the
lash band to start dissolving the
eyelash glue now this is a great tip but
if you want to really gently remove your
eye lashes they literally just peel off
and there's no tagging at your real
lashes and as soon as I've peeled them
off I put them in a safe place because
otherwise I will 100% lose them and then
I go in with some more coconut oil and
start removing my eye makeup I always
start by removing my eye makeup I just
find it way easier and you guys can see
and literally just melts and breaks down
the makeup so quickly and so easily even
if I'm wearing waterproof mascara and
then I take a makeup wipe and just start
removing that eye makeup from my eyes
this also allows me to see if I have
left any excess mascara or eyeliner on
most of time I haven't because honestly
this coconut oil is amazing and then of
course I go in with more coconut oil and
remove my face makeup and also my
lipstick
and then back in again with a makeup
wipe just to start removing the majority
of that makeup from my skin you can see
how gross that makeup wipe is then to
thoroughly cleanse my skin I use my
fantasy palette ultimate skin spa which
comes with three brush heads the first
one is this daily cleansing brush which
is amazing for everyday use it's really
gentle the bristles are really really
soft and it just removes any excess
makeup or any residue or dirt that's
left on your skin the next one is this
exfoliating brush which again has really
soft bristles more of a thorough clean
gets right into the lower layers of this
skin to remove all of that dirt and
debris and also removes any dead skin
cells and the last one is this silicone
brush which is amazing for dry and
sensitive skin because it exfoliates the
skin but also unclogs pores so that any
other products you put on top will
absorb it really easily I'm using the
daily cleansing brush and it literally
just pops on just like that and then I
use the cleaning clear oil control cream
wash because I do have all your skin so
this helps to just kind of control that
and I just pop a little bit on in the
middle of the brush and just start
cleansing my skin now because I love
this brush so much I actually manage to
get you guys an exclusive discount code
for 70% off so instead of it being $125
is actually 38 which is amazing
I believe the discount code is jordyn
but there will be a link in the
description box where you can click on
that and it will basically automatically
take the discount on for you so
everything you will need to know will be
in the description box
and you can see how much makeup is still
coming off of these in this brush it's
amazing and then I just wash all of the
face wash away and Pat my face with a
clean towel I always make sure I use a
cleans houses I'm not putting any more
kind of dirt or bacteria back onto my
clean skin every day after I use this I
make sure that I clean the brush head
with soap and warm water and pop it back
into the case that it comes with just so
it stays really clean and no like
bacteria or anything gets on to it after
this my skin is feeling amazing but I do
go in with a mask this is the body shop
warming mineral master uses about once
or twice a week this is really strange
the more you rub it in the warmer it
feels on your skin really strange but
honestly it opens up my pores cleanses
deep down inside and removes any excess
dirt that could be left even though
there's not much but this just leaves my
skin feeling amazing
I leave the mask on for about five
minutes just to do what it does best and
I start just maybe scrolling through my
social media so look through my snapchat
also take a scroll through my Instagram
and then after five minutes I will just
wipe away it mean mask with a flannel I
always use a flannel for masks I don't
know about you guys but whenever I wash
it off with water
I literally end up with like a flooded
bathroom it's just so messy so I prefer
using a flannel at this point I'm
finished in the bathroom so I do the
rest in my room yeah I'm in my Beyonce
job I go ahead and tie my skin with my
la roche-posay Sara's ink spray this is
really good if you have oily skin
or kind of spot prone skin and then I go
in with my manuka dr. brightening facial
drops if you suffer from tired and kind
of dull looking skin this staff is
amazing really kind of hydrates your
skin but kind of brightens it makes it
look glowy and healthy and really kind
of like soft look in at night I really
like a boost of hydration so I go in
with an oil
this is jojoba oil not only does this
moisturize your skin but it also helps
with any kind of scarring you have on
your skin from my past breakout it
really just helps to restore your skin
it's amazing now this you guys is what
saves me from those horrible breakouts
because I am human we all get premises
so this is called acne side now it is an
over-the-counter products so you do have
to go to your local pharmacy to get it
but it honestly is so worth it because
it reduces the size and redness
overnight is the best spot treatment
I've ever used so that's it for my
skincare routine I hope you guys enjoyed
