makeup tutorial for you it is of course
on the makeup that I'm wearing right now
so it's just really glowy skin we've got
a smokey eye with a pop of color
hopefully you can see that from there
I'm not sure
cocktail but OPI is like one of my
favorite makeup looks to do and I just
need to switch out with a little pop of
something lot of some also I'm so
excited because I had the amazing
opportunity to be able to team up with
iconic London for this video which
though some like funny thing is the
other week I actually ordered from them
so for them they like to come to me and
ask if they want to collab I'm like hell
yes that's why I'm so excited because
I'm actually working with a brand whose
products actually love well I only ever
worked with brows I love that you know
what I mean so just you know in the
video I used their foundation stick I
also use their powder contour palette
and my favorite their illuminate and
dropped I have to because these are the
ones I bought on these ones and they
sent me so happy hours to because
honestly I think this is my favorite
thing from their website
it's incredible if you're like me and
you love your highlight how did you need
this because game-changer so thank you
iconic London for working with me on
this cuz it means a lot you're the best
anyway I'm going to sharp now because
the matcha talked with England so if you
do want to see how I did this be then
interest keep watching by the way guys
not naked Java top on and off with
primer this little guy is the NYX pore
filler NORs again this primer is so fat
but honestly every single time I use it
there's just like primal flying about
like my skin feels so smooth though so
have a couple of little friends that
need to cover up today I just wake up
and it on my face so when they can cover
up for my foundation I'm going to use
the iconic London
pigment stick which is a foundation
stick looks like this - in the color -
point what and I'm just going to stripe
it on it might see a little bit dark but
once I've blended in and stuff it works
what I really like about it is how easy
is to bend it like can you guys see this
so easy to blend see what I like about
this foundation stick is sometimes I
find that creams can look quite heavy on
the skin like like Kiki
this one doesn't up oh it's got a nice
own coverage to really thing I'm not too
keen on it
to finish for me just because I've all
you scared I mean all my already skinned
boys and girls out there you'll know
what I mean just doesn't work for us
that's that's nothing a little bit of
powder insects we're all good Matt the
glow though does make my skin look hella
healthy so hello healthy honestly the
things I say sometimes for a little bit
of extra coverage and just kind of
highlighting my skin I'm going in it
with this onokay concealer this one is
the naked skin weightless complete
coverage you can see that I don't know
it's got the longest name of oh it's
good though so I mean by light must
cease I literally just look like the
moon emoji then where do I know actually
you're going to blend that out with my
sponge you guys know the trail
I swear always uses for I am consider
it's just like the easiest wait you guys
just ever blend for so long though that
you think they'll start to fall off
because them me to make sure we're all
pen did cool so I'm going to go in and
set my under eye stay away because I
don't want you know a Billy increases
hundred apply the Coty airspun I'm just
going to go right underneath the eyeball
so before i powder the rest of my face
i'm going to use these this is the
iconic London illuminator drops now this
one is in the original and I brought
this on myself but they did send me over
the one in shine which is more like pink
Toyota so you guys have an idea of how
insane these are so well it's like
liquid metal are you joking
I just wanted round in this I'm pretty
sure these are like the hot seller on
the iconic London website - right there
because they're fab like I've seen so
many people talk about them are on
YouTube on Instagram now I know why
because they're freaking incredible so
I've used these at both ways I've used
some over powder and under powder and it
doesn't make the powder those funny or
anything but personally myself I like to
use them before a powder just because I
find them stick into like a cream base
they kind of look more Julia and they
just work a little bit better in my
opinion so the way I like to use them as
you can see they come with a little
dropper I just go ahead drop a couple
drops on the back of my hand
and take my sponge go in and just apply
it to the highest point like look at
that guys I'm not kidding this is like
the ultimate wet skin look right
obviously a liquid it just melts into
the skin I love it they just blend so
nicely as well if you're looking for
glowy skin look no further if this is a
glowy skin then I don't know what is why
that's so pigmented as well as don't
need a knots which are like Hello she
said well when I win a chicken dinner
I do have all your skin's want you to
set my t-zone because otherwise game
ovah so I'm just taking some of my
circle or a kickass powder and just set
at ease I'm also just going to set the
size my face here so when I put powders
they don't go all muddy and patchy okay
think we're all dit so a lot like linic
product that I have to use with you guys
is their powder contour kit I think my
double chin just come out do some lip
balm lo because honestly my lips right
now Sahara Desert kind of bronze with
this one here see can you guys see that
how easy that is to blend you know that
for me is like my worst nightmare muddy
contours and bronzers and stuff
absolutely no the color it's really nice
as well it's not like orange or anything
it's not that perfect like hey I just
cover for a day now I'm going to go in
with this masseuse
some brush looking at specific Oh in
with the middle one here to consult it's
more like court owned I mean hopefully
you guys can see it just adds that
little bit of extra definition to my
face I mean I'm going quite light hand
exit don't anything too crazy but I'm
just going to try and make make a little
bit of cheekbone going on you fake it
till we make it I'm going to take the
middle yellow shade and just put some of
that underneath my eye just to brighten
you know it honestly is like the
smallest detail but to me it makes so
much difference can you guys see I don't
know but it works let's get out a little
bit of blush this is benefit California
I've been obsessed with this it's such a
pretty color put a little bit on here
those are going on here and I have a
hair on my lip right now CSI the skin at
comple as you can see it's just so much
healthier looking really glowy for my
eyes I'm going to use the kuda Beauty
rose gold palette now I love this and I
don't know why I haven't used on camera
yet but I'm pretty sure I have been
anyway no haven't my mind then was like
have I have I have I because I've zoomed
your eyes in a little bit hope you can
see a little bit better I'm gonna start
by taking Bay honestly the names of
these eyeshadows are so cute just going
to put that all over the lid as a base
so I'm going to take a mixture of
sandalwood and header and just work
those into my crease
going to keep blending that owl keep
going back and forth like this I kind of
want this crease to be a little bit more
like a sunset orange is opposed to like
orange orange so I'm just going to take
this makeup geek eyeshadow in lemon drop
I know it looks scary but I'm just going
to work that in on top of that I'm now
going to go in with a basi which is this
one here and also manis I just to create
this like dark burgundy shade and first
of all I'm going to start working it on
the inner and outer corner just to sort
of blend it into the crease color and
then I'm going to pack it onto my lids
in a sec this doesn't have to be like
majorly me or anything because we will
blend it all together at the end but
just kind of roughly put in the color
where I want to just go back in with
that brushing use for my crease just
really blend everything together I'm
going to go in with a black kohl pencil
just make sure it's easy to M oh my god
in my mind I'm blind easy to smudge it
so this is the second glory smolder Col
just going to take it and place it in
the middle of my eye then with a brush
I'm just going to blend it out now I'm
going to go back into bossy and moneta
and pick that off
so now it's time for the fun part of the
eyes we can add a pop of color this is
the makeup geek eyeliner in the color
mint and all I'm going to do with this
is popping it up it in my waterline
smudge it out a little bit yeah
cirrhosis cringes some of you a whore
cringes me out a little bit not gonna
lie now I'm just merging some of those
same colors views in our crease
underneath so henna and sandalwood just
going in with cocoa and I'm going to
line as close to the green as I can
underneath here just a sort of shadow a
little bit a bit more just add a little
bit more dimension you know but we're
going to work on some mascara this is
the Maybelline at last in shape what is
lean lush sensational and then I'm going
to put on some lashes I'm going to go
off camera and do that I'm going to do
the other eye off camera as well and
then I'll be back so I'm back my eyes
are done if you're wondering or
eyelashes these are they are be
backstage lashes in style Chelsey know
what though guys I feel like I look so
strange without eyeliner on without my
wings anyway anyways we're going to do
lips so I'm going to go in with a nude
lipstick because the ice is so bold bar
if you want to do a bottle it babe you
do a bold lip there is no rules this is
the Maybelline matte lipstick in 930
nude embrace
I love these lipsticks are so
moisturizing which is nice because my
lips are so dry the moment oh my god I
think I found my new favorite nude
