just something just so original so
creative no one has ever done this
before I am just so great so basically
it flying around the internet at the
moment has been this prank called the
song lirik prank and I just think it's
genius
I have been like non-stop watching them
I just think they're so funny
I'm literally assure that everyone and
their mothers knows what this is about
but basically if you don't it's just
where you choose someone to text and you
send them lyrics to a song and you have
to keep sending the lyrics to the song
and basically try and prank them and I
hope that they believe what the lyrics
are saying or probably be a fail like me
and just laugh at yourself I know I just
thought it would be something fun and
different for my channel so we're doing
it so I've seen the ones that like
somewhere at prank on your ex on your
crush on your boyfriend's first
girlfriend and I mean first of all I
don't have a boyfriend so that ideas all
the windows then what I do have an
expert to be completely honest with you
guys
um I don't want to do that there's just
too many emotions involved and I don't
want to do that to myself or even to him
though I'm not going to be doing that
today however I thought who better to do
this on then my sister like sorry sis I
have two older sisters but I chose the
oldest one because I feel like she would
believe this more and I'm hoping because
she doesn't really watch YouTube and she
probably has never heard of this prank
before I might be able to get away with
it I just might be able to bloody do it
it probably will fail though because
this is me but oh well we're doing it
the song I chose to use for this video
is uh sure confessions part 2 now first
of all I just want to let you guys know
see this is a commands prospective but
I'm going to just change the lyrics ever
so slightly to make it a girl's
perspective hope that's like okay but
I'm going to 60 lyrics as much as I can
but this is the only way we're gonna get
this to work and I want this to be
believable I actually want this prank to
work I've never pranked anyone before on
my the hive
I'm actually no that's why my neighbors
are okay for not basically the plan is
I'm going to trick my sister into
thinking that I'm pregnant I don't have
a clue how she's going to react but just
so you know what I mean by changing some
of the lyrics basically there's a line
in it that says says she's three months
pregnant and she's keeping it so instead
of saying she I'm gonna say I'm so said
I'm three months pregnant and I'm
keeping it I just start off with a
simple hey just to start the
conversation and she is at uni at the
moment I did take the last night though
and basically say to her like if I takes
you to marry will your applied scenario
at uni and she was like yeah why why why
like she lit she kept asking why and I
was like I can tell you that oh my gosh
she replied hey I'm on break good timing
lols I'm just gonna put back so you're
free to talk yeah I'm actually nervous
and I've already bad can I just like not
do this out can I just like change my
mind by I'm actually glad that she's on
break which means hopefully a replies
will be quite quick oh yeah what's up oh
my god I finish uni up for oh my god I'm
such a good youtuber I don't even have
the song lyrics up I'm gonna start with
verse one because I feel like if I say
the chorus twice to her she's gonna soft
wake on so what's the first thing this
will be the hardest thing I think I ever
had to do what is tell me what's the
next one yeah be talking to myself
asking now uncle - she's probably like
what the hell is actually going on I
gotta go she'll just tell me Jory it's
me
I'm feeling bad already I'm actually
feeling bad already what's the next time
about that check on part one I told you
I was creeping with um so I'm going to
change up to so that guy on part one I
told you I was keeping with I'm honestly
like such a bad sister because honestly
she is unbelievably caring she will
never believe anything I say to ever
again and then she okay her apply was
what guy and instead of guy's name with
a question mark I'm not gonna include
his name because I just can't I don't
wanna get anybody included in there
every months pregnant doll and I am it
keeping it three months pregnant and I'm
keeping it she's gonna think I'm like
high or something
I'm my heart is still like racing that
was probably the worst line I could have
possibly have said I'm gonna send her
the next one because she's taking too
long so first thing victims emerge we
got purified do you think you can keep
it well does that you mean I was going
to say second thing how do I know whose
it is
my god I feel so bad okay right I'll
call you at 4:00 okay just be calm okay
I'm here for you
the thing was me wishing that I never
did what I did how I ain't ready
feeling bad what the like you know I
wanna know though healthy people like
prank on an everyday basis I have way
too much of a conscious like I I feel
horrible right now I actually feel
horrible oh my god she's actually
ringing me oh my god no I can't accept
this she finally takes back okay it's
cool okay there are two options I can
ring you quick now that explains her
calling me but I said oh good say you're
some guy on this side I know I've got
one on the way okay it's cool okay don't
worry I'm here and I'll sort it out okay
I can pick you up at about 6:00 oh my
god I'm laughing but like a secretly
inside I feel really bad because she's
actually believing it I think I'm just
going to the next sign so that like the
conversation just keeps going I pick you
up at 6:00 yet and we can go talk
oh go on phone call from he he used to
like tell me she just wants me to tell
you trying to figure out when what and
I'm gonna just come out of my mouth

say it ain't gonna be easy but I need to
stop thinking tough and platon nigga bed
