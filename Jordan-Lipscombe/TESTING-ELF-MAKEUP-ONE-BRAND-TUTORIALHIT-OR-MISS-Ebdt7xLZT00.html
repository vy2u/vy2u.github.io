you're doing though today I have tested
out elf cosmetics my entire face is full
of elf makeup actually no that's a lie
my eyelashes are for everything else's
so I put elf makeup to the test it is a
drugstore brand and it actually is sold
in super drugs now which is so exciting
that is where I got all of my makeup so
there wasn't as big of variety as there
would be online so kinda was limited but
I picked up a good amount I feel like
even though it is a drugstore brand I
just wanted to put it to the test and
see whether is worth you guys spend in
your dollar on you know if you want to
hear all my thoughts on a bunch of elf
makeup and also how I did this makeup
look here then just keep watching
I think I'm going to start by testing
out some eyebrow products because when
you look at my poor little brows I
picked up two different products because
I can choose so I chose the eyebrow
pencil and the eyebrow kit I think I'm
going to start with the Apple pencil
because it's calling my name I picked up
the color neutral around this little guy
is a slim mechanical pencil that shapes
defines and fill them brows for a
natural polished lip there is a little
studio winner so I can tame these and
there's the nope the pencil I'm already
happy with the fact that this is
mechanical because it means that I don't
off the whip out my sharpener and if I
have to wipe out that sharpener Jeff
anyway it looks like a mini crayon okay
it's the first off not like blowing my
own trumpet or anything I don't think I
could have trained a better color this
literally matches my brows perfectly I
actually really like the formula the
pencil I think it's fast the only thing
I don't like if I wish the pencil itself
was thinner I think is too thick so it's
really hard to create really
natural-looking strokes at times see I
do actually like the pencil itself
I just wish when she was smaller
just remember Jordan I rather sisters
not twins try not to spend your entire
lifetime filling your everything by bro
I'm not mad at it have I tried said
eyebrow pencils
yeah have I tried worse so sure not go
either it's definitely on those eyebrow
pencils where you need to clean up your
brows because I might think I look a
little cray
enough school plane I'm not filming
enjoy a holiday and then picked up their
split brow and lash mascara so I assume
this is like they're setting gels like
their brow gels oh how cute there is an
N for your eyelashes and an end for your
eyebrows I'm not going to be using on
where I should say just my eyebrows so
which n do I need this one that's so
satisfying so I'm noticing straight away
that is quite a thick gel and it has
also picked up some color from our
eyebrows which to be honest that's so
normal so it's leaking on me to be
honest with you I feel my eyebrows are
not going anywhere I'm going to tell my
face so I think I picked up the poorest
face primer elf has so many different
primers that Kaos has so many different
things they have one for redness
blemishes hydration they just have like
everything I picked up the pore this one
because typically them I save so one
thing I have noticed about over as a
brand is their packaging it's on fire
like this is like a high-end product to
me
so dr. Yoo this is meant to prep your
skin to your makeup goes on evenly for
long lasting matte finish helps reduce
the appearance of pores fine lines and
shine and it's infused with tea tree
vitamins A and E to help skin looking
youthful which I'm only 19 but I mean it
can't harm me colleagues just like a
moisturizer I think I put on way too
much oh the limes I can smell the tea
tree the texture of this is really
strange it's really like slippery kind
of feels like a moisturizer but like not
that make sense
definitely does invert like moisturizer
but they thought I'm adding a little bit
of like silicone in there for you right
never I can never really tell how good
they are until I sort of worn my makeup
but I mean it feels okay it's a little
bit too but it could make a good base
onto a foundation so I picked up this
one this is sort of the only one they
have to be on inside working with what I
had flawless finish foundation is oil
free and it has an SPF of 15 in it this
is in the color bath now just so you
guys know when I hear buff
ultimately you think it's one of the
lighter shades but I don't actually
think it is it's got quite an effect on
color to it
you guys want the other selves have 20
million light bulbs on me but I do
actually have sat around quite tight and
just I don't think it on camera it's got
quite a normal consistency not to see
it's not to stand that is quite dark
you know what the colour actually isn't
as bad as I thought it would be no I'm
blending it out we're just drag it down
the neck to be safe weight hoops are are
what are you playing
and it has a really nice finish to it
like a really nice girl oh I'm more like
Chloe
it doesn't really natural on the skin as
well like I don't look like I'm wearing
a ton of fundation even though I
definitely am because I like to be take
place but I don't look cakes they forgot
to cover up my Gucci Bags HD lifting
concealer so this is meant to hide
perfections but sort of smooth
everything out and make you look like
whatever that means
oh it's actually a lot smaller than I
thought I'd be I don't know I thought
would be longer but is Benny oh it's
actually quite thick I'm finding myself
hands like get back in as well because I
thought the want don't hold on much
product but up
standing out really nicely it's got a
nice amount of coverage I'm actually
really happy with the way my skin looks
right now looks really healthy I always
cut boys like yes out to set this all in
place I'm going to be using the HD
powder in the color sheer sheer a color
sheer this looks like one of those
really really really really finely
milled powders now normally piles like
this the flashback that comes with them
girl and I have read the ingredients on
the back and there is silica roundness
which probably means this is going to
flash back like a little beeyotch bar
will work with it oh it comes with a
little path oh it's cute but like see ya
well it'll be a puzzle you myself I just
like to use a brush skill this little
single it's like snowing
yeah instantly that makes my skin look
my skin looks so smooth that's a really
annoying thing about these powders is
they flush back but they make your skin
look insane which is why I'm always I've
done it because this is the kind of
powder you want to wear when you're
taking pictures but you don't want to
wear it when you're taking pictures
because you're going to look like a
little girl
I'm sitting the rest of my face with
this powder as well now that I've parted
my skin one thing I'm starting to notice
if the foundation doesn't quite have
enough coverage for me I feel like
especially down here where I've got like
scarring and stuff it's not fully
covered and I think I put a lot on for
my bronzer and a blush I'm going to be
using the blush embossing powder of
course it's a nice mirror in here as
well I went for the duo called Fiji by
the way it looks like this she's going
to start with the bronzer so definitely
not as warm as I would you should go for
in a bronzer but it's burning out really
well I can tell it the formula of these
is really really nice I feel like where
I have got a completely even base
underneath it's kind of like turning off
a little bit I'm going to put on a
little bit of a blush all that is
pigmented girl I'm like I'm blushing
literally if I could change one thing
just if I could I've probably made this
a little bit warmer but then again would
I thought this would be quite a shade
for contouring for me so oh no what time
is it
highlight time this is the baked
highlighter in moonlight pearls I'm so
excited it's not like super in your face
like I'm here I'm here for it when it
blend and slow well into the skin that
it kind of looks like a wet finish
oh you're going around with about a
highlight that you can like freakin see
your reflection in it I'm going to try
using this wet so I actually have this
elf makeup setting spray package in
today's give this a little shimmy-shimmy
stephanie has made a bit of a difference
hit my nose in Cuba so I just feel like
hitting in the shoulders with some of
this you know I mean why don't I feel
like as well this is definitely one of
those highlighters we have to like yes I
like get past that first layer to really
see it working and then once you get
working it's like oh now I'm going to do
something with my eyes I have literally
no idea what that I'm you know with it
I'm actually going to start by prepping
my eyes with that same concealer just
abstain so this was the only option a
palette I could get my hands on I want
shadow look for something with a little
bit more color in so I could do
something a little different rather than
neutrals but this wasn't like it yet
this is the amount from our eyeshadow
palette and you get 10 different matte
shades I believe looks like this it is
really pretty I did also pick up these
though I believe these are called the
molten liquid eyeshadows something like
that anyway I got the colors brushed
copper and rose gold so I think I'm just
kind of like do something with these I'm
just going to start by taking this shake
here just to set my eyelids that way
everything will blend so much nicer on
top you know we've got to get these
eyeshadows of Fairchild no I think I'm
going to you know I have no idea what
I'm doing I'm going to take a mix of
this one in this one and just use out of
my like crease come up with a pigment is
not bad at all so she really nice it
seems for blending out really nicely as
well not patchy or anything evil which
is sad I'm now going to go in with this
color right here and just pack that on
my outer corner that's not quite dark
enough so much you're going to go in
with the black just to deepen up a
little bit yeah I feel like that's so
much better
I mean this isn't bad at all I just like
sometimes I put product on and blends
and
then I just keep blending away the color
so I can't build up that well I'm
actually going to take the rose gold
liquid eyeshadow now and try and do some
sort of half cut crease with it because
it comes with a little dose of
applicator Oh God look at that to do
what that's probably the easiest and
quickest way I've ever done
this half cut crease thing you can
actually create a good line with this
applicator can you going to see her like
easily I'm just mapping the owl is a
really recognize it as well one thing
hoping for is that they don't crease I'm
hoping you don't you to set them with an
eye shadow will see I'm going to clean
up the edge with on fine snatch that
edge just taking off half my foundation
but they worry about it hopefully you
guys can see a bit how to actually start
to crease or meal it'll be a house dried
down now though I put on some mascara
now this one is the Amelia mess on the
face volumizing and defining mascara so
to me that sounds like it's meant to
give me volume but not be clumping is
the wand like oh nice there's actually
really nice to me though that is more
lengthening and defining as opposed to
volumizing but I feel like if I kept
building up the product then you could
get way more volume ignore the fact I've
got it everywhere happens literally
every time just to finish off the look
so I'm going to go ahead and apply some
falsies just to add a little bit more
the lashes are going to be the only
thing that'll from L I mean to l-3 since
your lashes I don't even know I'll apply
these and then I'll be back so I'm back
I've applied my lashes and then I just
put a cover those are colors from the
eyeshadow palette all my lower lash line
and then as limosaurus well one thing I
didn't use but I feel like I have to
mention is the elf liquid liner I think
this is like three pounds I used in my
last video and all my gosh this is so
fast so fab so if you're wondering what
the elf liquid liner was like hopefully
does help so let's take this little guy
is the only lipstick I picked up so
hoping it will match the look otherwise
I have no idea what I'm going to do this
is the velvet matte lipstick in blushing
Brown which Oh
the finish of this is more kind of
Sasson it's a more comfortable map where
as I like a I'm going to be a sting on
your lips all day and not coming out
kind of that so I'm just going to take
some of the translucent powder into pat
on top then the last thing to do is
spray a little bit of sevens braid this
is the makeup mist and set Oh miss Donna
is really nice okay chin talk this is
the completed look or a few guys saying
overall I think I like everything apart
from at the foundation and the powder
eye only reason why is it like the
foundation is this our awkward coverage
where there is coverage but it doesn't
cover enough and I feel like it's made
for powders on top like the bronzer
everything that really patchy especially
on this side of my face I'm just not
really feeling it looking like a little
patchy mess over here and then the
powder is just a flashback
I'm never going to personally reach for
it because of that so they are
everything else I'm super impressed with
I really like the liquid eye shadow I
really like the lipstick the highlight
is cute yeah if you guys did enjoy this
