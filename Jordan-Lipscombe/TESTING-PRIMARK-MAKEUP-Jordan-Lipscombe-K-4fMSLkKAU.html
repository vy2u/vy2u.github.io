to be a testing at Primark makeup video
which is why I have a naked face right
now hold my face that she's so pale
compared to us my body but it's because
I fake tan and I don't fit on my face
because I wear makeup
so I went ahead and bought everything
for kind of like a fourth phase I'm
hoping I've forgotten anything but I
mean this is maybe the majority of it I
did buy the other day but some of it has
just been seeing in my drawers because
well I've been wanting to film this
video for so long finally George sits
doing it she's filming it so all's good
okay we're gonna jump straight in
otherwise we're going to be here forever
so hyper so this is the PS stay all day
Prai Mike sends the way of makeup smooth
skin to create the perfect base for
makeup I've taken the sticker off of
this so now I don't know the price
Vardhan drops think it was about to
pound 50 though literally just like a
white liquid that's all right now we can
watch my face and literally go red I
thought I was gonna feel like a
moisturizer it's actually quite thick Oh
what smells like yogurt I don't really
like now I just feel like I'm smearing
yogurt all over my face my skin feels
nice though obviously it's a primer so
I'm not going to know how it works until
I've worn my makeup but feels nice I was
going to go to onto foundation but I've
just seen this and now I want to use it
this is the PS strobing highlighter
cream this is in how I think I was also
a pink one as well but I'm not about
that pink life look at the packaging as
well like I want to have like a really
glowing base because we all know how
much I love to go
of course I've taken the price off of
this as well I think it was about two
pounds to time 50 and you get loads in
here as well 42 milliliters that's quite
a lot I'm going to blend in with this PS
a little stippling brush I think this
was about a pound one pound 50 just to
this okay now I look like I have a Sula
I wanted to be glowing I'm Bobbi this
Mays I'll be the full face of
highlighter and right now because that's
how I feel I actually really like it I
think this would make an amazing
highlight like on the highest points of
your face it doesn't even feel sticky
either I was worried that it might
no stickiness going on here so for my
foundation I have these e to the PS love
foundation stick side raise a stick ones
because I kind of felt like these might
have better coverage Plus it'd be
interesting to see how good these are
cuz I know stick foundations are quite
popular at the moment like the makeup
for everyone um you gotta start of every
heels one yeah not I'm saying that these
are going to be just as good but these
were two pounds so I got mine in natural
and medium I have no idea what color I
was gonna be I'll let you pick them up
and was like put that in my basket so
this one is natural this is medium I'm
going to go for medium it seems a little
bit lighter also I am matching my
foundation with my neck not my face
obviously because imagine if I walked
around with foundation discolor how much
is in there a decent amount my guess
wrong I'm going to see how it works with
a sponge this is am Primark sponge by
the way do you know what the color is
actually a little bit off but that was
pretty easy to learn now and that's got
good coverage I'd say that's like a good
medium coverage so creamy like it just
like glides
robot that actually isn't that bad I
thought was going to look quite cakey
but it doesn't and it's got quite a nice
finish as well like a satin finish so
for my concealer I don't actually know
why I pick this up because I hate
concealers like this for underneath my
eyes but I mean logic this is the PS
concealer obviously and it's just one of
those like stick crown ones I really Oh
new drop-down this is in the color ivory
I hope it's okay I really don't want to
like - you really hate the feel of this
it was like I'm like dragging my under
eyes the colour is not bad though I'm
actually going to use that same sniffing
brush that we used earlier to blend this
out
it actually blends quite easily
surprisingly
oh that's looking a little bit cake even
ITP to be fair I can't really complain
it's not the worst thing in the world
but there are definitely way better
concealers out there looking a little
bit cakey like I said but you know what
490 P can't complain want us everything
in place before my face literally melt
off this is the PS loose face powder in
light is currently mineral based and it
was to pound I always do that and this
is also a Primark powder brush I think
this was one pound fifty two pound
whoa I've gone really pale I can kind of
see the powder like sitting on my skin
as well I don't really like that going
so well up until now before my browser
picked up this Pierce a brow kit this
you get two powders and a brow wax as
well this was 2 pound and it also says
tweezer and improved brush included see
well that makes oh great
just drop the tweezer spot can you hear
that
you're so plasticy I don't think I can
use it this is like a double-ended brush
this is a pound so you get obviously the
little angled brush and a spoolie and
I'll use this on my videos all the time
like this is amazing wash my brows I'm
going to mix the wax and this dark brow
powder as well
honestly I'm not a huge fan of that
bracket um the works was the only one
that was pigmented the powders weren't
pigmented after I had to go into them
about 20 times um but annoyingly the wax
is just way too warm I couldn't fill my
eyebrows in with just our it's not awful
I've tried way worse brow products but
you really have to work with it and like
take your time carry with the face this
is the PS master contour palette this is
the powder one they did also have a
cream one but I'm all for powder go so
this is only six pounds and you get like
four maybe five like bronzing and
contouring pinky colored brightening
shades and then also highlight so this
is what it looks like
I think I'm going to go oh I'm going to
use actually to bronze this is the PS
blush brush again I think this was a
white one pound fifty just glue I don't
have pigmented this is
it's a nice color I don't know if you
guys can see though it started to go
like muddy on me all here I really
wanted to love this I did I kept trying
as well like I was like nope it's not
going to go muddy gonna try a little bit
of blusher this is the PS blusher it
doesn't have a name but it's in this
like ready Moroni kind of kinky shade up
gonna take on that same Agra brush I
don't know how pygmy this is going to be
but oh nice pigment it is a really
pretty color though I like that it's
easy to blend as well and this was one
pom 50 that's not bad
so of course you guys know I was looking
around for a highlighter because I can't
do my makeup without one so I did find
this pH strobing kit like a little
highlighter palette looks like this but
I think I'm actually going to use this
the packaging again amazing this is the
PS complete face palette the nude
collection so you basically you get free
eyeshadows this is meant to be a blush
but I guess you can use as a nice show
as well you get a lipstick a a
highlighter and a bronzer I'm actually
gonna use the highlighter in here
because I'm going to use these shades
for my eyes
so it's like an all-in-one thing okay I
don't have a brush to use for my
highlight so I'm just can use my own but
yeah do it oh that's pretty
it's quite I like golden shade but it is
really pigmented I have a fan of that
but guys really nice I'm like glowing
okay I'm gonna do my eyes at wall
creasing I'm gonna go back in with this
palette and I'm going to use these sort
of eye shadows up here and this is also
a prime at brush this is that eye
contour brush I think it's called and it
was one pound fifty so let's see how
this girl is just basically a fluffy
fluffy blending brush use the brown and
put it in my crease is super like
powdery though
you know what for pigment that's
actually not as bad as I thought I
thought whereas powder it was just gonna
like blow off of my face that's not bad
the brush is quite nice as well only
thing is I wish it was smaller I'm gonna
go over another point brush on this is
the D end the end the end smokey
oh my god double ended there so it's
like flat on one side then it's got like
a pencil brush on the other I'm going to
use the flat side and take you know what
I'm actually going to go in with this
one and the highlighter as well and I'm
going to put it all over my lid like the
brown eyeshadow but the other ones they
just seem to like once you put it on it
just off goes away I don't know so this
is the PS liquid eyeliner this is a
pound this is amazing by the way I swear
by this I've used it before this is not
my third ball I love it it's just got
like the nicest little brush ever it's
just so small precise
my wings are on this is the PS amplified
I'm pleased I'd get it mascara I'd first
of all the packaging yep
I'm just gonna this'll be luscious
that is actually so good I think it was
two pounds as well
oh my lashes are looking good if you ask
me every time I do mascara always get up
here I won't like the mascara is in a
pretty good job but I'm still going to
apply some falsies because like it's me
these are the PS Fulop flushes these
were a pound this inner corner is trying
me right now also where the lash band is
so thin they're really easy to apply now
the last bit lips whoa so this is the PS
lip liner pencil in the color nude this
is one pound so just give it a go well
it should just like glides on that's
nice for a pat on for the whole but
whatever color officer I've used one of
these before but in a different color
and I love the formula these are the PS
velvet matte lipstick crayons and this
is in the color ballerina
so these are just so creamy I actually
really like Primark and lip products and
that is such a pretty color
how breeze arm it's all this and I was
like hey why don't I try this as well
because I always do like a nude lip so
this is the PS super matte liquid
lipstick in the colour College just like
a brown I think I love liquid lipstick
so I'm hoping this is good ah that color
though on this color it is quite like a
thick formula but it's not uncomfortable
or anything
you
I love this color oh my god it's like a
ready Brown feels super comfortable as
well nice everything I have to test out
in this video today I think what I'm
going to do is in the description box
below I'm going to put a little star by
the items that I absolutely love just so
