again with another YouTube video I have
a certain someone here with me this is
my sister Lee for those who don't know
wish to be fat you actually might not
know because she's never been I'm not
actually I take it back and take it back
you're in like a video like a couple
videos ago yeah I'm pretty sure when we
did the whole like workout routine this
is the one that was in that video today
is a really exciting a video because we
are doing a it's humbly it's like
full-on girly glam transformation on
this one so Lee doesn't wear makeup like
rarely ever and when she does she was
the smallest amount she is basically a
tomboy she is the definitely a tomboy
yeah like she looks but oh like she
rarely wears makeup like she is
basically the opposite of me literally
basically so I thought what would be
really cool is basically to do a
transformation video and Connie turn you
into me yeah give me like a little bit
of taste of what I do to myself I'm
pretty much never do mazes
she's like every day so I went ahead and
gave her a full face of makeup like full
glam full beat like my whole makeup
collection on your face I don't also did
her hair as well in this video I know
that you guys really enjoy seeing me do
hair on my channel so I thought I would
incorporate that obviously I've done it
only but I did actually use the same
curling one set on my hair as well so I
kind of thought I would not only show
you it on Lee's hair who has like really
really long hair like look at this I
will show you how it works on short hair
as well I mean you guys have seen me do
my hair a few times on my channel anyway
but yeah just to kind of see you on both
lengths I guess so really really quickly
before we begin let me show you this
kind of monster because then I can tell
you more about it now rather than later
if that makes sense okay so here is the
curling one set that I used for this
video this is a by a brand called a foxy
bay and this is a product that
used to create a little headaches today
this set the package in it I kind of
like die every time I open it there is
seven ones this is the seven in one
detachable wand set so basically in the
set you can create every single
hairstyle that you can probably think of
like it's all in here so you get seven
like I mean that looks like someone else
at least got like the lil attachment
here you let my little assistant like
yeah I'm reveal what is really cool
about this curling wand compared to like
other kind and once I've used my channel
before the library's cold as you can see
like it's hella key the rose gold is
there for a reason basically it has the
rose gold titanium in it which is meant
to help the coal a stronger in your hair
that's a lot of science but how far was
that this is all you would need from a
cannon wand like literally and it like
holds the moisture in your hair so you
get like a glossy a hair look it goes
really hot like mega hair I already burn
myself
no like you don't even need the heat as
hard as what you'd normally have know it
so the wand goes all the way down to
sixty degrees which and I think I've
ever known a want to go solo and then it
goes all the way up to 220 well I had it
on my hair for six seconds I think it
was and like it was Pelt like ready done
ready to walk out the door it was so
good
only a house like a little screen where
you can like see it turn on yeah yeah
yeah so you can see like numbers and
stuff so that's cool I use the smallest
wand in the collection and it made me
achieve like really really big like
curly I have the 71 set here but they
also do a three in one set and then they
do loads of like single ones as well
what's really really fab is they have
given me a discount code for you guys
because you know anytime I can save you
guys a little bail money
you know I well I'm all about seeing
that dollar over here so out check out
if you use the discount code foxy Jordan
I will leave on screen here so you can
you know you know visually be happy that
will give you 60% off like 60 that is so
it's so good on 10% off not toning not
even birdie 60% off you see I will leave
that also in description box below so
that you know you don't have to remember
anything what's fab about
me and Lee is that you can see that you
can get like it on longer hair I'm sure
head not just my short hair like works
for all hair lengths and all hair types
as well so yeah I think that is
everything so if you want to see this
tomboy to girly girl transformation then
just keep watching okay so here is Lee's
makeup bag this is literally all that
she has it's basically empty like look I
can genuinely school and I go to go I
don't have time you know a pound of this
and put this all I wish I did but she
literally has a bit of like foundation
but it's not especially tinted hydrating
gel cream she has some bronzer she's got
some bare minerals concealer some lip
balm and a mascara that's all and then
she does have a naked 3 palette German
donated and then wait for it wait for
this is her brushes this little pot here
this is literally half of them I
wouldn't even know like what's like
what's that for
eyebrow maybe I don't even do my
eyebrows these they're literally my
eyebrows what would I use that for so to
begin with I'm gonna take me L'Oreal
glow and more and more that was really
French this is basically a glow drop so
I'm gonna put that on our skin to begin
with just to give her some like glow
does everyone not like to be glowy
I love to be glowing they're like wanna
see same I'm not the kind of person who
like can do not come out a face I always
have to put a highlight on no matter
what this is Chloe this is super glowy
this stuff it's L'Oreal as well as
trucks noise so kinda like the iconic
London ones but this is like a bit
thinner I feel like so I like using it
girl you glow no oh my God look at that
then once you put like foundation on and
stuff you won't look so crazy you're not
gonna look like a grease ball you look
like a teen for foundation I'm gonna use
the x1 in Visio a liquid foundation just
because this has a really nice undertone
and I feel like it would go really nice
with your skin yeah let me check yeah
you know who do it we're do it then
brushes a rip GG I know for these
they're so cute they're like pink it's
pretty the most nicest brush of ever
using my skin out the two brushes I own
and use how do you feel right now about
me putting this much no how about
putting this much makeup on you
I'm actually excited to actually see
like what I look like you know in full
glam I think I've only ever worn a pair
of fake eyelashes literally once yeah I
don't have ever even bought a pair of
fake eyelashes so I'm kind of excited
for that I have a really nice skin like
it it's like a pretty even like a
texture like for it so I feel weird like
paint in your face about Oh like your
age that what you like I don't know know
about you I guess this is the sister
that no one has ever really seen tonight
you're not me like a camera girl are you
know you're gonna just like I'll stay
out of it and watch from like behind the
seat yeah I love watching you I watch
YouTube every day
oh I'm 20 like nearly 25 literally in
like turnoff weeks I just work part-time
at Morrison's because that was my job
whilst I was literally during my degree
yeah that's the thing that I used to
work at testicle yeah it one just gets
like a job to kind of like yeah I made
some really good friends which I'm like
super happy about I went to Oxford
Brookes University and I studied a
medical science and nutrition yeah and
that's it really
oh I did used to play football she is
like a football cow okay like she is
like the opposite of me it's so funny I
am basically a tomboy mum said oh I
always wish I had a boy and I was like
mom I am your boy yeah I did get scouted
for Chelsea and Brentford yeah I still
laugh at boy still play football just
not as professional because obviously I
kind of had to put my career first but
me and Lee are legit like the opposites
of each other
I'm light into my makeup my hair my
fashion in fact I'm paid in her face
right now you guys is like it's crazy
even to this day I have never seen me
with a full face of a pig in my 20 years
of being on this earth she was so
excited she was like I think I'm so
excited
please let me paint your face please
leave it doesn't even fill up bad
actually does it feel like clogging your
I really want to use a Beauty Blender
right now then use one but clean and
you're gonna like freak out and forget a
spot and blame it on you yes sometimes
like because when I do cancel because I
used to hold on a second when I do when
when I always actual only reason we're
like why I don't wear like a lot of
makeup is because I'm so paranoid about
my skin like for me like having like the
blemishes
or my skin was something that super got
me down on honestly a few months ago
field I saw my skin like I have like
well they call it like multi moderate
acne that's what I had I see others with
acne and I don't even notice it but on
me it was just something I was always
like literally so conscious about and
that's generally why I just look after
my skin like so much more and I driver
just go in a bare face because Mike it's
just my skin it's so sensitive
once you find things that you like full
of you're like yeah yeah this by the way
this is the hourglass they all
translucent Sam powder I just use it for
the first time the other day and I'm
actually obsessed it's so nice
I'm just gonna like set y'all yeah don't
it melted off girl right now when we
gonna night out something I'll put on I
say of their makeup of me you know quite
a bit but it's yeah yeah compared to me
I'm like yeah that's like my entire
makeup click I'm okay even if I just
like shoved my hair up I kind of do
something with my hair and then leave my
face I'm pretty cool with that it's kind
of what I do in kind of everyday the
time being that's quite nice being a
naked girl you know being and I
completely see makeup as an art because
it is an art because I've cut it's not
no one can just get grab and makeup
brush and make it look at me yes so true
makeup is just a way of enhancing like
what you'll see yeah the beauty that you
do have I say makeup is not there to
change like your features or to like you
know make you into a new person it's
just there to enhance what yeah I have
show off what you already have this is
why yeah well why not like if you can
make yourself feel better by putting on
makeup why wouldn't you why the hell
noticing like yeah it's the same of
anything like life's too short to not be
confident in yourself and if you like
adding some makeup to your skin makes
you confident and why wouldn't you do it
yeah by the way this is the makeup
forever
bronze fusion this is not one my
favorite bronzer yeah I love this color
ever and it's so nice and it has this is
Lee 25l one I think that's what it's
called and it basically has like a teeny
bit of glow to this to it I mean mine is
well loved to have like a brand new one

are doing I turn it or is someone else I
watch who I love his makeup girl James
Charles do you have to shop yeah Charles
is one of the most like creative he is
so creative know how he thinks of half
the ideas he thinks old just this whole
like concept the way he just looks into
like business and stuff like that and I
don't know he's just such like an
inspiring person you know like and he's
so young as well old is he I think is

in like Gucci orogeny yeah nice tattoos
he's just like they're like topless in
his tattoos it's like a love like come
on I know no one can pop from Jeffrey
what is out of every single video you've
ever made vlogs included what is your
favorite video ever done
don't actually no no it's gonna sound
weird I don't think I really have a
favor
I wish you'd love filming so it's any
video but there's never been like a
video where I'm not oh my god like not
that I'm like being harsh on myself
there's never a video but I'm so proud
of myself for not just I mean I enjoy
all my content but what are the hardest
videos to film at the hardest not the
hardest but the longest has definitely
been videos yeah I will be filming for
literally hours but you really like
doing those as well isn't my favorite
yeah like JLo by the end of their
journey tape okay Geoffrey where's my
Gucci Tom I'm not having a number
definitely not I wish but my way let's
go in with like a little bit of shimmery
make sure I mix these two together I did
you know excited about trying to stick
these songs eyelashes on me
today what I find false eyelashes easy
to stick on other people then actually
myself my god I could imagine me trying
to do what is your like most memorable
like childhood memory of a me you and
Charles has by the way that oh sorry
that's my sister some reason they call
each of a child don't ask me why cuz I
don't even know but I do remember the
time when we were at London granddad's
and this Sam is that you probably like
saying it right now and I heard me and
Sam peer pressure joins us right I'm not
even joking so my mum would even vouch
for this okay when we were little
Liam Sam used to gang up on me all the
time I was probably only I was young at
this point I said I was like 11 10 11 or
something oh if your daddy's little baby
me like no I use this and I you give me
like 10 pound or something if I do it
and I just nipper and my nose was
burning for the next like said she lit
she had tears full-blown coming down I
could not stop sneezing Eva how'd you
remember that time you've got a piece
stuck up your nose for three days oh
yeah that hum and Jordan were just like
chilling out see this one Jordan's so
little mamas like Jordan what's that up
your nose so she Jordan was probably
only about five or six at the time me
and mum so I said if his children was
laying down and she shouldn't scream
fing in her own eyes anyway so mom like
children sit up and I see like blow into
a bit of tissue or something moms like
was he trying to get it out there like
EMI oh my god it's a
we didn't have peace we didn't have
peace peace for dinner for like three
days ago
yeah well that's only because like we
never told mom and one's gonna find out
later right this second we should watch
this video we were putting peas up and
eyes and shooting them back up with our
play you're like peace I got my know for
free days that's actually just who even
am i that's such a weird kid what do you
how do I about me being a youtuber how
do I let happen so when people like say
oh my god that's your sister I see I
don't see myself like that I'm just
gonna walk out but obviously I still see
you as like the normal like my little
sister to be honest like when people
asking stuff obviously like I'm super
duper proud I said one thing you cutely
okay fine it like really like inspiring
because obviously like although like
stuff that you went through at school
and stuff and I just feel like since
like you know doing the makeup and stuff
and kind of doing YouTube to be honest
really bought her out of her shell like
really bought out who she really is
because obviously I felt like a lot of
people never he saw who she really was
because he was so quiet for me
personally it's that I feel like it's
the best thing for her because she's
really come out by shell from it she's
really being who she really is no I
don't know like when she the day she
reached some million subscribers I'm
more like in the front room like we were
literally I literally drove home as
quick as I could we did funny enough
when I hit a million me and my mum were
out viewing the venue that we wanted to
yeah only impacts we knew we're gonna
hit it soon but we just didn't know
where we were driving home yeah and I
was driving and I wasn't freaking out
mom was like on the road concentrate on
the road I'd drive home as quick as I
guess I could get there straight for the
million but no it's kind of weird
because you always like say when you're
younger or like I suppose you always
like why do people like cry when they're
happy
like who cries and they're happy but
like until you kind of like feel like
that moment of the INA major band or
like you're so happy for someone else I
suppose that's kind of like what I felt
like really you know I saw it coming but
I did and if you know I know I opened so
quickly actually my friend I'm at work
today spoke to me and she said she was
out like in our local like shopping
center and she was in a lift
and they were saying oh yeah so did you
watch Jordan Lipscomb sauce video and
they were actually talking about you and
my friend was like oh my god that's so
cute with the hair yes she was like oh
it's really well I heard them talking
about your sister so I was like
that's obvious like even still to the
states so weird to me them you actually
like even know who I am the weirdest
thing I think for me is like when we got
shopping or you know out in a public
place and people come up to our and they
like shake or they cry or like they look
oh my god they can't keep their
excitement yeah oh my god peace we have
a picture like this we're obviously
really sweet you know like someone else
make sure you that happy you know like
or they look up to you or and stuff like
that which I think super cute it's still
weird for me cuz I'm just like oh my god
that's my little sister like that's
weird like you know it's so cute when
people do that yeah this is a verdict a
pencil sorry I'm just peeing into your
water I don't know it's like the
weirdest feeling ever
okay I'm always like when I do it you
were really cheer about that like how
many wait I'm election I than me when I
had my videos I'm like look what kind of
night it's in a weird ways that's
pickling yet like awesome mascara I'm
gonna use the Maybelline lash
sensational this one is actually least
one such my favorite mascara - no this
is like what investments always there
alright I'm just gonna put it on her
because obviously hygiene
oh yeah he's on the floor oh my god it's
my only bond I don't got my makeup off
save your air I've never had this done
this is weird my voice my friend weird
don't even have normal ashes maybe oh
she did poeple here from backstage which
these are so nice I've heard of them
yeah these are like really affordable as
well these are like 12 pound 50 or
something yeah they're really feeling
well loved eyelashes like that you're
looking like what are you doing
different I like okay cool down yep sure
absolutely
let's get this show on the road yeah
that's much better now yeah doesn't
there we go sit left on my I know can we
all just pre-show the fact in kind now
my eyelashes we've now clippers
yeah that's fine but they're really
comfortable but do you do this all the
time
yeah I'm but to be honest with you this
can sound crazy but to be honest I mean
why not more natural makeup recently but
when I'm not filming that I actually
find sometimes sticking on eyelashes
quicker then do my mascara cuz when I
wear mascara I like packing on a to Worr
you boys and girls that wear these lash
him lash it Russian Russians when you
wear these lashes
you literally deserve a medal oh man
girl I know
oh my god I actually really like here in
a weird way I sit now girls and boys
every time she goes in boy out Jordan
don't worry George is just going to a
little shop big shop at the moment to
find the product let's use this body
shop lip pencil in the color Beach Oh
your new lips but you want a so far like
if I had like really nice big clumpy
lips I don't know if it's you know like
because I got very small features I
think cherry smells like a pencil and

go in and this is quite like I feel like
it will look really nice with the lips

god I love this lip color this is one of
my favorite lipsticks ever by Mac who's
so nude and I love a good nude who does

OTT we put some gloss and use this types
of colors on I was just caught undressed
yeah that looks really nice you're like
lipstick over for me luck cuz I feel
comfortable
yeah like honestly you just even feel
that bad to be on it I'm really shocked
just felt like the whole entire process
like all of this just this is a lots
gonna feel like heavy or like make my
skin feel like oily or dirty or like but
to be honest I actually really like the
feel of that foundation it covers really
nicely but it like it doesn't feel like
anything to hair you love setting spray
so we do it so I'm gonna using Mac prep
and prime fix pass gold light you love I
think never even used to won the gold in

right now are you I'm really excited
thanks Bob looks so good because it does
look really good like it just looks
really like I actually love this
foundation thank you wait hold on this
let's add it to the makeup bag jackpot
goes I'm not even just saying this cuz I
did it like I'm not a makeup artist like
it looks good on like I'm not but just a
good on you
yes of ones is endless when I do do my
hair I generally have it like
lightweight leeway yella it's kind of
like my thing I use this one which is
why it's attached the small one there
are another six to choose from so what
you fancy with that one looks super easy
you literally just clip it in turn the
little thing and done like you literally
