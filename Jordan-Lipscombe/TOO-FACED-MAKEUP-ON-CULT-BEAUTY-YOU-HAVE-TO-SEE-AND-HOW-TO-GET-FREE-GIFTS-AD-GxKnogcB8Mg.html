again with another youtuber video so you
know how in my last video but the one
before that I said about how I really
want to start doing more one brand
makeup looks I do a little clothing so I
wanted to nail a lot of makeup and guess

video is in collaborative which is so
exciting because copy is actually been
one of my favorite websites for the
longest time now like anytime I want you

or just the more harder brands to get
hold off they stock them so it's so good
so yeah cold beauty have challenged me
to do a one brand and make up a look and
that brand is gonna be two-faced now
I've used a few things from Too Faced

there is a lot of stuff I've not tried
so I'm excited so you might be wondering

to me so yeah guys happy shopping anyway
right let's get into this two-faced
testing a video I may or may not have it
on my face right now
who knows so yeah if you want to see my
thoughts on a bunch of to face makeup
and maybe to see what you could spend on
Too Faced
encore beauty then just keep watching
back in there thank you very much I
don't even really know what to star so I
think I'm gonna go ahead and do brows
fast even though low key I freaking hate
doing my brows first I hey you happen to
be out really careful and like going
round them like I just I have two
different types of brow products here
because honestly I kind of couldn't
choose I mean normally I'm a pencil girl
but I got like both types just so we can
say we can test it's what I'm here to do
so if they're brow pencil which is
called the chocolate brownie brow me
brow it's called the cocoa powder brow
pencil it's 12-hour where apparently
well it's waterproof and then I also got
the brow kind of like pomade this is
their bulletproof brows 24-hour
waterproof Kashmir clay and bulletproof
bra bra well because you get brush
not even gonna lie there's a pretty
decent brushes way yes fully and an
angled end you don't like some products
you get a broad brush and it's literally
like this more when you're kind of like
like what the hell am I gonna do with
that is this is a good size this cuz
size does matter
think what I'm gonna do is use the brow
pomade on like the end of my brow and
then the bar plans to pull brow pencil
at the front of my brows just to kind of
get that more gradient right let's do
this let's get some brows on my face so
I'm gonna kind of draw a line underneath
my brow and then on top just to create
the shape and then kind of fill it in as
I go along by the way this palette is in
the color universal brunette it's
actually a really really nice color like
this is the typical brow color that I
were to go for it's completely cool like
no warm tones at all its creamy at first
and it just like completely dries down
like that is dried down I do not feel
like that is gonna come off like at all
like that brows on there for the next
year I'm not normally a pomade kind of
gal as far as I go that's a good one i
haze it like it's a freakin pet peeve of
mine when pomades are like hella dry and
like crusty whereas this one that really
isn't when you're working with it now to
try the pencil what color is this little
guy in deep brown okay so you get a nice
little spooley on one end and then on
the other oh that's like a really
interesting tip it's like a little
rectangle but it's kind of like angled
into a point
oh my god that's gonna be so good for
the front of your brow I can just help
no hair strokes you have got to be
kidding me I was with the nest in front
of my face and I like low-key smoked
chocolate and I was like there was no
way that this could smell chocolate to
face tons guys full on chocolate
let me just like a beauty Gary you a
second like genuinely look at this tip
like look how fine that is gonna draw a
line underneath and the line on top oh
she had meant it and then just kind of
like a flick up
why was that the easiest thing I've ever
used in my entire existence on this
earth let's see if I can do little brow
strokes oh my god like what how was that
that easy to do that like you have on a
real note though I don't think I've ever
used a pencil that's filled in my brows
like that gradient and then been able to
add really thin brow strokes as well I
love everything the color the formula at
the shape like this is so different and
I love that if I had to pick one between
the pens from the pomade is definitely
the pencil right now that this brow is
done I'm gonna go ahead and do the other
one because she got to work for it and
then I'll be back and we can carry on
with okay so a brows are trouser on and
probably looking the best I can actually
get them right now I mean they're pretty
bold right now
they kind of like a bit in your face but
I have to say these two face to brow
products what the hell like I genuinely
feel like these have been slept on I've
not heard anyone speak about them and I
don't really know why so I think I'm
gonna go ahead and do skin now so for
primer I'm gonna take the hangover RX
for punishing at face I've used this
little guy before on my channel I do
really like this primer I feel like this
is the kind of primer that would be so
good for more like drier skin because
it's a super hydrating primer it's kind
of like that moisturizing type primer if
you know what I mean I mean I have oily
skin and I still use it like it doesn't
affect anything like that
but I'm just saying for dry skin you are
gonna love this and on top of that it
smells for you pal it smells like
coconuts like a beach a beach I meant to
say it reminds me of being on a beach no
it smells like a beach and actually
gives you a tacky base so your
foundation have something to stick to
foundation now okay for the two years
I've been doing YouTube okay I have
never used the Born This Way Foundation
when this one I should come out this
will saw what raved about and even to
this day I know this is like several
people's favorite go-to foundation now
if there's one thing I love to do is try
out new foundations to find that perfect
one for my skin no I have AF skin so
finding a foundation that actually wants
to stay on my face and not
on the ground she's a bit of a task so
I'm excited to try this one out and see
if maybe you can be in my like top
threat who knows it says undetectable
with medium to full coverage Foundation
its luminous its oil free I'm gonna use
a Beauty Blender but a real boo you
blended this time for and new as well
is that not just the most satisfying
thing you've ever seen guys UK was
prepped I've already run this under the
tab like honestly beauty blenders in the
UK and not actually the easiest thing to
get hold of like we can't just walk into
a store and get one but Cobb you stalks
them which is fast let's do it let's
just go in this is the color warm beige
and I actually think I picked pretty
well wow that coverage is so nice I
definitely see what they mean by medium
because I can still see bits peeking
through but I guess if I just put on a
teeny bit more yeah you can literally
get to a full you know the only thing I
don't really like about the real beauty
blenders I've noticed come into other
sponges it blends out my foundation
beautifully like flawlessly but it
genuinely soaks up ash it's on a product
that's the only thing but it does make
my skin look cute so it's a right
blender I'll let you all you know I mean
this color as well is so nice it's got
that nice yellow undertone which I love
to kind of match up my fake tan I love
the finish as well it definitely is a
luminous that you can see the Gulag
right now on my skin I feel like it's
struggling to cling onto my nose a teeny
bit like I'm not getting the coverage
that I want but that could be better
with a brush I have to say though so far
I'm really impressed with the way that
this looks on my skin it doesn't look
heavy or like I've got a layer of
foundation on my skin you can still see
my skin peeping through the foundation
it just looks really fresh so far I
really like it
now for some concealer so again this is
another product that I have never used
this is their bonus way naturally
radiant concealer it says it's oil free
again you know I'm about that oil free
life because I already have enough
myself I have two shades here I have it
in light medium and the medium medium
looks more like my skin tone and I kind
of want a more Breyer under eyes I'm
gonna go for light medium the packaging
is cute I thought all those who face
packaging there is hella cute right like
genuinely gets me like deceased Tempe
under around my funeral so
let's get these triangles going on it's
actually a little bit thicker than I
expected
I don't know why I thought it was gonna
be hella thin but not like thick but I
can feel kind of a bit of drag when I'm
doing it do some highlighting kinda
smells like coconut kind of smells like
alcohol can you use my Beauty Blender
again like my favorite way to blend up
from Stila spending how easy like my arm
is not having to do a workout this is
gonna sound so weird but kind of to be
expected because it's called the same
thing it genuinely reminds me of a
concealer version of the foundation and
like if Julie like the foundation I feel
like it's got that medium slush
buildable coverage to it I wish I don't
mind I mean personally I like a full
last coverage concealer because I wanted
to cover all my insecurities my problems
you not I mean
I feel like personally I would just like
a teeny bit more coverage but I have
really bad dark circles so let me put on
like a teeny bit more it does just look
really good on the skin I have to say
it's a really nice concealer the only
thing I wish is that I had a teeny bit
more coverage but apart from that
everything else about it
ten out of ten right let's settle this
hard work in place so I have two powders
here I have the powder to go along with
the Born This Way range this is deep on
this way a thorough real Athar real SSR
real thorough it's there loosing powder
I've actually used this before and I've
used up a whole one so that's probably
saying something so I might try this one
because I've never used it before this
is the primes and poreless skin soothing
soothing smooth element smoothing skin
smoothing a pressed powder Prime's and
poreless primes before makeup then sets
foundation after without changing skin
tone which is fab provides a stunning a
soft focus effect for all skin tones
even under bright and unforgiving lights
the real question for me is does this
powder flush back anything that's not my
skin's moving I get like Hello scared
that it's gonna like ghost me out so you
have the powder and then you have a
little pop baby pop these things kind of
gross me out a little bit so I'm just
gonna put you oh yeah guys oh that's
really loud all the brushes that I'm
gonna be using in this video again are
gonna be a first impressions however I
have heard Ruger things about this brand
so these brushes you can get on cult
Beauty which is fab they at
have so many brushes so many brands it's
so called but these ones are by zoeva
which is a brand that I've heard many
good things about this is the complete
set of fifteen brushes and a clutch you
had me right ladies and gents and clutch
it's so classy right like you could
legit use this as a clutch for a night
out or you could you know just put your
makeup in it whatever tickles your
pickle and then of course you main part
the brushes now what I love about this
brush there the one thing I always hate
about brush sets normally is you never
get good eye blending brushes like they
just don't exist like that fluffy crease
brush like I don't know where she is
whereas in this kit you actually get
proper eye brushes and I'm here for us
you get five face brushes in this
collection and then you get ten I brush
is too is so weird I don't feel like I'm
putting anything on my face right now
this is the 106 powder brush by the way
it definitely has Matt to fight though
like if you compare this side of my face
to this side of my face I'm not gonna
sound Ernie from my eyes because I kind
of want to use the loose powder to bake
so we'll just skip that but so yeah I
can't feel the powder on my skin so it's
really really super finely milled um
poreless I don't really know I generally
just feel like it's kind of like any
powder to me like it's not standing out
like crazy right let's do a flash test
let's see if this flushes back hmm I
can't tell whether my face just looks
really pasty because I have no color on
it or whether that's like a flush back
cast my face doesn't have patches of
like why it just overall looks quite
Casti so I mean it's okay it hasn't like
blown my socks off or anything I do
think I prefer the loose powder from
like remember I'm just taking some of
the loose powder actually just to make
underneath my eyes I don't know why I
just prefer a loose powder underneath my
eyes I'm just gonna like leave this to
bake singing like a little crazy for a
minute if a bronzer I'm gonna use a
product I have used before this is their
dark chocolate Soleil long-wear matte
bronzer this one is the dark chocolate
one the reason why this is my favorite
one is because it's so warm for bronzer
in the brush set there is this little
one here but I kind of want to save this
for blush I feel like it's smaller and
just will be better for blush so I'm
just gonna go back in with the same
brush that I used for the powder I'm
pretty sure I use this bronzer in a
first impressions and I actually ended
up really liking it it is quite red
toned I think this is made
more like darker complexions but hey you
know what we break the rules around it
no but it is true though makeup doesn't
have any rules so just well whatever you
feel comfortable with she's so soft oh
it's doing a really really good job at
blending out my bronzer as well I'm just
gonna wipe this bake off why have I got
one eye closed and it's so weird when I
do my makeup honestly I don't I don't
know why do half the time blush now I'm
gonna be using this palette here look at
this
this is gorge just looks and feels so
luxurious take a look at this how
freaking pretty is this packaging this
is another product that I have never
tried I'm pretty sure there's highlight
blushes and bronzers oh my god
look how like stunning they are this
highlight though on a still guys
protection off on this so we've r128
cream at cheek brush I'm gonna take the
color pink sand which is this one at the
bottom I'm scared
first of all this little what blah first
of all this little brush is the perfect
size for my chi heat from this colors
cute as well they have the perfect
amount of pigment like you don't go in
it get a craps on on your brush put on
your face and then ruin your entire look
you have time to like build it up which
is perfect for blush because the worst
thing is too pigmented blush like it
just once you go in you can't go back
chic you like its rosy and just give me
some color I like some life back into my
skin yeah cute chick you're cute and I'm
excited to try it the rest of the colors
in here like this highlight here on to
the next now normally when a highlight
is good people talk about it right and
maybe I missed the hype on this but I
haven't heard that many people speak
about this highlighter so I really don't
know what to expect this is their love
light prismatic highlighter this one is
in the color you light up my life hi
function she cute or whatever so this is
the highlighter it's super golden like I
hope it's not too golden I think would
be alright look at the pattern on this
highlighter they look at that so pretty
feel like I'm just talking about
packaging geez
the only brush like a kind of fine for
my highlighter is the won 1-0 face shape
brush I'm just going to use this right
let's go in
oh okay I see you I'm gonna be real this
brush is not the best to use for
highlighter but I mean it's going on
there the color is really pretty and
it's got a really nice shine to where I
would say that the formula it definitely
has that more metallic shine to it
rather than that wet look which I'm not
mad at Oh
this brush is good for the bridge nose I
mean you can't say I'm not glowing right
okay two-faced skin so far they know
what they're doing they know what
they're talking about okay it's so I
makeup I don't really know what to do at
this moment in time I have a shadow
palette in front of me some liner we're
just gonna roll with it we're gonna go
with the flow so the palette I'm using
today is the natural matte eyeshadow
palette so inside you have just a bunch
of matte shades I've kind of doubled
into this palette a couple times but I
haven't properly used it you know to
create a full eye look not gonna lie
though like these shades of I have my
Shri
oh wait I'm gonna prime my eyes first
using that shadow insurance 24 plus our
anti-crease eyeshadow primer so it's
kind of like a nude color and it's
actually quite thin I was kind of
expecting it to be a bit thicker I don't
know why I'm just switching to this
zoeva concealer buffer brush to blend in
and it actually has concealed all the
discoloration on my eyelids which is
always a must from me it has to create
like a really smooth and even base so my
eyeshadows can really pop and just make
it easy to blend out etc look at me
talking like I know why I'm all about
okay Jordan right now back to the Holly
I'm just going to set my lips with the
color heaven now typing into the color
called own natural on a two to a a luxe
crease brush which looks like a perfect
fluffy kind of like blending crease
brush no she's pretty pigmented you know
it's the kind of color that you wouldn't
think would do much but this one
actually is this brush as well is
blending it out so and I see like it's
keeping the product concentrated but
it's buffing out the edge it's if you
know what I mean it's good it's good
it's good now taking a two three one
luxe petit crease so it's the same brush
for smaller basically the names in this
palette by the way are so funny
sexpert cleavage risky biz so cute so
key oh that is pigmented I'm gonna put
this in the crease - whoa
and then on that same brush I'm gonna
take the color sexpert which is like my
favorite name in the palette and just
deepen that line up ever so slightly I
think I'm going to do some salt cut
crease who knows
cuz I don't know do you know what they
seem to be blending out really really
nicely like they don't look patchy or
okay I think I'm gonna do the cut crease
thing so I'm gonna take the Born This
Way concealer again just put a little
bit on my hand taking this luxe smokey
shader and the concealer we're just
gonna carve out the crease I mean I'm
not really too sure what I'm doing
but if that's not the story of my life
I love how like dead silent is right now
holy guacamole this brush is so good for
a cut crease I'm gonna take a mixture of
heaven and laced heady and kind of set
that in place and then to fade the outer
corner I'm just gonna go back and forth
between hook up and sexpert just to
really deepen it and fade it in to the
lid
yeah these eyeshadows burn out so nicely
like the fade from the outer corner
going in is really nice so I am
impressed on this zoeva brow line brush
it's just like a really thin little guy
I'm just gonna take a little bit of
sexpert and just outline the cut crease
here just around it to get it really
sharp just defines that line a little
bit more I guess should we do a little
wing should we do it we go all out so
I'm definitely at least gonna line my
upper lid just so when I stick on lashes
it looks okay and I myself still gotta
clean up this but the sketch marker
liquid our eyeliner inspired by Japanese
calligraphy pens are innovative formulas
code to be exceptionally smooth vivid
and waterproof if I can actually get out
actually made the packaging like a pen
that I've given it that little hook of
it here as well that is so cute now I
never normally use pen eyeliners because
I feel like they run out quite quickly
if you know what I mean when you're
using them we don't charge over here
this could be the best eyeliner I've
ever used in my life the tips nice and
thin oh I like the tip I can get right
into the root of my lashes it's super
black as well jet-black I was gonna do a
wing but I don't know if I'm brave
enough I can already see what's gonna
happen okay I'm gonna draw the wing and
it's gonna get thicker and thicker to
the point where I cover up all the
eyeshadow I've done my eye
okay so I've done one I know we'll try
and do the other wish me luck
it's time to put on some mascara on
lashes because I'm feeling a little bit
naked to mascara you can probably guess
um I'm gonna use be a bed out then a sex
mascara is it really better than the sex
up to you but it is if we can get
mascara so I know that this mascara on
Colt beauty is a best seller so even
just with that information is like it's
good I feel like this is the mascara
that people always repurchase I guess
people's Colts Colts copy you okay
Jordan just stop Oh like a look at this
mascara on my lashes to be completely
honest you could so just use this
mascara and be done but you know your
keel is gonna put on some lashes this
mascara every time I use it I'm like yes
like this is what I want my lashes to
look like these are my real lashes this
is what this mascara does to my lashes
if you are looking for a new mascara and
you've never tried this one you need to
right let's tickle some lashes real
quick while my lash glue is drying I'm
just taking hookup underneath my eye and
then I'm just gonna blend that out with
own natural just a really finish off the
eye makeup you know bring everything
together lashes are on I feel like the
eye makeup is actually complete now real
quick I feel like I want the bottom lash
to be I must make yes I'm just gonna
take a random brown little Kohl pencil
and just pop it into my waterline lining
your waterline is the weirdest feeling
ever
wow she looks the weirdest thing ever
finally we're on to the last part of
this testing video which is the ellipse
have a few things here to try I have
some of their melted matte liquid
lipsticks which I have used before do
you really enjoy these I have some of
their new are I'm not sure what they're
called but they look like this they're
like regular lipsticks and their
packaging look at this the Too Faced
just know how to do packaging like it's
official and there's like a bunch of
nude colors and sort of dark Browns and
stuff which i think is so nice I also
have one of their melted liquefied
long-wear lip sticks as well here I
already know how to use do you know what
I think I'm gonna use one of their
melted matte liquefied matte lipstick
things this one here is the
that cool girl which I feel like will go
quite nicely and then I might be one of
them melted liquefied along my lipsticks
on top we'll see you know I can't really
remember I thought of these liquid
lipsticks I don't think they were overly
drying at all because I used to wear the
absolute crap out of these I realized
the way they apply though cuz they're
not overly thick so you don't feel like
you've got you know something on your
lips but they're not really super thin
that they don't have any color so though
they're nice they're nice I like them so
I'm gonna take the melted lipstick so I
don't think this is Matt I think it's
just like a married lipstick this is in
the color sugar oh that smells like
sweets and color is pretty I actually
really like the applicator as well like
