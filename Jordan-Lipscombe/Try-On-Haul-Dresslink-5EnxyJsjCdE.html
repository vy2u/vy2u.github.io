and accessories try and haul for you
guys and it's for the company called
dressed link now if you don't know who
they are or what they're about basically
they're an online website that just sew
really affordable kind of clothing items
accessories beautybay it's just pretty
much affordable everything now they did
reach out to me and asked if I kind of
want to choose a few things from their
website so everything in this video I
did choose myself but it will 100% be my
honest opinion whether a company has
reached out to me or not I will always
always tow guys my honest thoughts
because there's no point sitting here
and telling you I like something when I
don't because pointless pointless
everything I got in this video will be
linked down below so check that out but
first I'm going to start with the
accessory bits and then move on to the
clothing as I go along I will give you
guys kind of like prices and my thoughts
and things so let's go the person you
have to show you guys is this really
cute little navy blue mark now this did
come in different colors I think like a
wine a town a white a black a navy but I
picked up the Navy because I do already
have a black backpack so it just has a
little kind of imprint on the front and
then it has a little zip pocket at the
front and then inside this is quite a
small a rucksack that inside there is a
ton of room I can feel like you could
fit a lot in this bag and and then
there's a pocket at the back and then of
course like adjustable straps at the
back it looks a bit weird sort of flat
because I haven't actually used it and
filled it out yet but so you get an idea
this was five dollars fourteen which is
amazing and it's sort of just like that
kind of shiny like faux leather a thick
bag but I do I do really like this bag
the quality is really nice and for five
dollars you just can't go wrong
picks up these pair of sunglasses and
it's really hard to kind of tell on
camera but they're sort of mirrored
silver and blue effect kind of lenses I
put them on so you can tell it's going
up with my hat but just so you can kind
of get an idea of what they look like
and I have to say the quality of these
is so good like they feel really really
sturdy like they don't feel loose or
like they're gonna fall off I don't know
if they suit me but I really like
so these were $2.00 17 which amazing
price and the Quebec thick like the
material like the plastic is quite thick
so suppose I could grow a pair of
sunglasses
I like these I also picked up just one
of these little beauty blender dupes and
this was 84 cents which is so crazy but
I'm one thing I will say about it is
when you put it in water it doesn't
actually expand however I think this
would be amazing to kind of like blend
out and your concealer or any sort of
like liquid contour or even your
foundation like why not but I just think
it's so cute like little tiny ears so
cute
but it is actually like nice and squidgy
like it doesn't feel like a rock which I
find some like sponges feel like rocks
but this is actually nice and squishy
and soft so I have been seeing these
flying around a social media at the
moment they're like a huge thing they're
kind of like oval toothbrush brushes so
I decided to pick up one of these this
was where is it it was $1 52 and it is
so soft so soft I didn't realize how
soft this was going to be but it's
amazing and the bristles are all kind of
tightly packed I haven't seen any
shedding yet and also I've seen ones
from Amazon and eBay people have been
saying they've had to like hold their
finger at the back of the plastic
because it's quite flimsy whereas this
one like I don't think you have to so I
think dresslink actually have a better
quality one than Amazon and eBay so if
you're looking at to just try one out
for $1 fifty two you can't go wrong so
I'm excited to use this oh just being
everything these next things you guys
I'm so excited about these are the Real
Techniques bulb metal brushes dupes
hello I'm so excited
so in this you get the powder brush the
kind of triangle foundation brush the
contour brush I think this is the blush
brush and then you get the kind of
eyeliner slash eyebrow brush and then
the two eye brushes as well so you get I
think this is the full set um they all
feel really really soft and really
good-quality the contour brush I'm so
to try out one thing is they're really
light like the this is just plastic and
they're really light and I think the
real techniques ones are meant to be a
little bit heavier but apart from that
they look the same they feel really
really soft because I'll be honest with
you I can't justify spending like
twenty-two pounds on one brush like um
they're meant to be drugstore and I feel
like that's a high enterprise so I think
by the way I think they were like seven
dollars so that's literally like a
dollar a brush mental then picks up one
of these kind of straighten our hair
brushes that I've been going around as
well I got mine in the white one I think
there's also like black and pink but I
got the sort of Europe plug they do come
with all the different plugs like UK
Europe like all of them but I got the
Europe one because they didn't have the
UK one in white so I just picked up this
and then got an adapter with it and that
I can still use it here this brush was
$7 84 so so cheap I haven't actually
tried it on my half and try to see if it
straightens it I have turned on to see
if it heats up and it does it heats up
to 230 degrees Celsius that is and it
comes with like a plus and minus button
so you can actually take the heat down
if you like so I'm really excited to do
this if you want to see a video on this
okay doesn't actually work kind of video
then let me know and I will do that for
you but um yeah if this works I've just
paid $7 for a straightener what so now
moving on to the clothing items one
thing I have to say is the sizing is a
little bit off they do recommend to kind
of go up a size because they come up
really small so if you're a small to a
medium if for a medium to a large accept
job they do have a size conversion chart
on the website so if you're struggling
that should maybe help but I got all my
clothes in a medium I'm like an 8 so I
pick them all up in a medium just in
case she is wondering but again I'll
kind of like remind and say everything
as I go along so the first thing I have
is a bikini and it's going to be really
hard to show you
of the way that it is but it's basically
just like this little black bikini and
then it has like a band to the bottom
here that wraps around you does that
make sense
so if you can just like try to imagine
it's sort of wraps this bottom bit here
sort of like Rupp's around you if that
makes sense it's really cute and then
the bottoms are the same as well and
they just sort of wrap around you like
this one thing I will say though I wish
you could get a different size in Eva
thing so I'd keep a medium for the top
I'll get a large in the bottom because
these were just too small to fit around
my bum and they kind of had the whole
like full cheek thing going on which
none of us want that the end of the
world because I can just pair this with
a pair of black bottoms but just so you
are aware they come up quite small the
bottom so if you've got a bit of a bun
just be aware of that if you are a kind
of like seek up around that area the
medium will fit you really nicely but if
you have a bit of a bum these will
probably come out a little bit too small
so it's a little bit awkward for sizing
but I mean I have a really nice cute
bikini top out of it so I'm happy with
that
this was only as well three dollars 79
so I love this and also the kind of
banding is like elastic in case any of
you is wondering so it kind of like fits
really nicely around you so this next
thing I've been seeing kind of going
around on my Instagram and that and it
is just one of these little kind of
bralette style tops and so it's just
sort of mesh and then it has this of
lace crochet detail covering up the nips
but one thing I have to say is the
material of this isn't that great I'm
going to be honest it sort of is just
this like mushy material and it's quite
like flimsy and the quality just isn't
as good as anything else but having said
that for how much was this I think it
was like yeah it was three dollars 56 so
for three does 56 you can't go wrong I
guess and I got this in a large now the
booth bit fits
however the bit that goes around
dozen it's too loose so all I'm going to
do is attach some of these like bra hook
things onto the strap and then I'll be
able to kind of like tighten out tied
tight I do think it's really pretty so
this next top is this really cute bloom
white off the shoulder kind of flowy top
I got this in a medium and it fits
really nicely the top part is just like
elastic so it stretches over your arms
really nicely and then you look just
like it's just a really nice flowy this
was three dollars 56 which amazing just
with like a pair of jeans I feel would
look really nice just something really
cash
I love off the shoulder tops I think
they're so flattering but this is just
like a winter piece I picked up and it's
just this really flowy um gray jumper
see that it's longer at the back as well
and this is really really soft like
inside is that really soft material a
couple things about it though the
material isn't like jumper immaterial in
a way and then the edges are just
literally looks like someone has just
soft cut it if that makes sense
but I quite like that that's quite edgy
and a bit different it's just a really
like staple wardrobe piece like a baggy
gray jumper to have for the winter
four dollars 24 as well so for a jumper
that is amazing pop it's just a white
kind of one of those like holes in the
shoulder kind of tops and then it just
has this really nice sort of lace detail
at the front I got this in a medium and
it fits really really nicely one thing I
didn't realize is it is I know that
it was share on the website I'll be
honest but you can wear like a really
cute like bralette underneath it or a
vest or pearl whatever you kind of want
to wear underneath to kind of cover
yourself up a little bit more this was
four dollars 46 and it is really
good-quality its sheer but it's like
that nice sherbet Oh need that
too much talking yes next he shot well
something just really different so I've
picked it up so it's just this like
plain gray long-sleeve t-shirt and then
at the back it's basically like open and
crosses over so we really have to show
again hopefully you'll see in like the
Tryon section before are people going to
think I'm wearing my top back to front
but on it just looks really good and it
doesn't actually look like that again I
got this in a medium and it fits just
kind of really loose and casual it was
three dollars 23 so this next thing I
picked up I was just thinking summer
when I saw this because of the colors it
is just this adorable little play suit
so it's just sort of blue and white
chevron print on the top
I think it's called chevron print and
then the kind of floral shorts on the
bottom now this was six dollar 72 so a
really really affordable price I got in
a medium and one thing I have to say is
it fits really really nicely like it
sort of hugs your curves and sits nicely
one thing I have to say though is it's
not long enough it kind of gives you a
bit of a wedgie and I'm not that tall
I'm react five five so the last thing I
wanted to share with you guys is this
place suit now this is probably my least
favorite thing because it's just way too
complicated and I get so frustrated when
I'm trying to put it on because it's one
of those things that you can wear like
multi ways little place suit so you have
the like obviously the shorts on the
bottom and then you have these two bits
the material here so you can kind of get
the gist that you can wear it like
fierce and wrap it around yourself
somehow so you have like a deep V like
plunge or you can like cross them over
each other but as you can see it's just
two really long bits of material and I
don't really know even what to do with
that I'm going to be honest with you
guys this was 638 so a similar price to
the other one and it is this is really
thick this material as well it's sort of
like layered so it's definitely not
going to be Seyfried because sometimes
white things can be see-through but this
isn't that was everything I had to show
you guys like I said every
we linked in the description box below

pieces out you can just a massive thank
you to dresslink for letting me try out
