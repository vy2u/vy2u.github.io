Jordan back again it with another
YouTube video we're doing something a
little different today it's not a makeup
look it's not a clothing haul you know
what branch now making things a little
bit spicy so I don't know if you guys
have seen but going around the tube at
the moment has been this photo a
challenge it is called the ugly location
photo shoot challenge so yeah disclaimer
I didn't make this up this is not my
challenge like I'm not taking any
ownership of this whatsoever pretty much
what it is is you find like an ugly
location basically somewhere where you
wouldn't think oh I'm gonna stand in
that bid something not very like
aesthetically pleasing and you make it
look aesthetically pleasing for a photo
that you could put on the gram it's that
kind of vibe the reason why I actually
wanted to do this was not just because
you know a little bit of fun but because
I get asked about my Instagram photos
all the time where I take them how I
take them who takes them how I edit them
there's a lot of who's in housing whites
now let me tell you I do not live in a
photogenic place what so ever there's
just like streets around me it's all
like gravel there's a dump ten minutes
down the road beautiful there's a park
or two-minute walk down the road and
when I say Park I'm talking to swings a
slide and a seesaw if you like it so
basically I wanted to do this challenge
because I want to show you guys that you
do not have to live you know in LA on
the beach with a cocktail in your hands
to get a good photo you can live a
normal life and be a normal gear like me
so let's do this I'm going to show you
guys locations the final pictures and
everything
location number one was actually in my
garden now I don't have the biggest
garden and at the moment definitely not
the prettiest okay so we are gonna do a
start in my garden because at the moment
it looks a little bit there probably say
what everyone did she would everywhere
yes Elia it's gonna be
I mean Cheers that is gonna be once in
first days 30 months mine the camera I
go I'm at yeah let's do this
I kind of like assess the I'm taking
this way too seriously
I just kind of looked about and fought
like what could I actually do with all
this wood it was all all the wood and I
thought okay why don't we make the most
of in actually use it as like a prop so
I could like lean on it like yeah it was
like playing around angles and stuff you
know get yourself a boyfriend like Elia
no furillo app she didn't turn out to be
bad you know and then another way we
thought was maybe should just like lean
on the woods you know kind of like sit
down at cache that's it yeah you doubt
this okay I did so you get you're a bit
oh but no that is good so here are the
photos for the outside garden wood area
situation I don't even know now I'm not
mad at them they are actually my least
favorite photo that we took that day I
don't know I just kind of was like
easing into the whole photo taken and
they just one my favorite we were kind
of getting like used to it
also location - it was legit my local
town centre car park that was it it's a
multi-story car park and we literally
went to one of the top levels because
it's the quietest first of all because
you know I didn't really feel like
having an audience or getting run over
so I thought it'd be a cool idea to
stand right in the middle of this
carpark and while there was no cars
quickly get a photo like an angled up
photo so I look really tall and you can
see all the black bars and the levels
and stuff and you can see all the
writing on the floor
honestly looking at the photos I was
being extras Frick was getting the arm
up and everything oh okay obviously Elia
and my mom were like really helpful I
like telling me what would look good cuz
they I can't see myself how cool do
these photos look honestly this is
definitely my favorites you know I think
is I love the angle of this photo cuz I
look really tall you can see my entire
outfit just so cash as cash is standing
in a car park with your arm on your head
take a look you can tell it's just a car
park but there's just something really
authentic and like opening about this
photo
I've not like tried to make it something
it's not if that makes sense so anyone
could literally recreate this then next
we actually didn't change our location
we stayed in the car park but we thought
would get more of like a ground shot we
use the metal barriers and stuff that
like are behind the car parking spaces
if that makes any sense at all and I
kind of crouched down in that like this
is like a really Instagram pose to be
completely honest
so the finished photos here they are
love this one as well I love the stance
I love all the like the little lights
and stuff in the background that you can
see the good thing is that you can still
kind of that as a car park right you can
see this orb markings on the floor for
the car parking spaces and yeah like
this one day no just low K okay this was
this was probably the most uncomfortable
place this place stunk we always this
specific set of stairs
smells like we I don't understand but
the reason why I chose this self stairs
in particular is because there was like
a bit of graffiti and stuff on the wall
and I feel like that could be quite cool
to get in we thought we kind of called
you just sort of stand next to the
graffiti and get more of a head shot on
this one we played around with angles we
tried the left to me the radda me the
upside down on me and I think in the end
we got some pretty rad photos we got
this one here and then we also got this
one here so I actually decided to put
some shades on in the end definitely the
grungy stand sort of least attractive
ugly background for sure that ain't
pretty they're not free and the smell
one pretty either and then while we're
on the topic of the stairs
always always always a little tip make
the most of your location so take photos
in two or three different places in this
one place if that makes sense
that way you kind of have backed up
photos and a ton to sort of play around
with and they all look different even
though you took more in one place the
first photo I loved is cutting your
typical photo on your stairs like a
super like body action that kind of
position that sort of like carefree like
chillin I don't give a position that is
honestly one of the easiest ones to do
and always looks good in photo so give
it a try you feel like struggle to know
what to do with your seven photos
because sometimes it's me I want to see
sometimes I'm so awkward I'm like see I
love the way this photo turned out for
sure it's really really minimal in the
background but I loved that
and then as you saw in the clips there
was this red and white
tape I guess you could say and it's just
randomly on the stairs but you know it
was pretty cool pretty damn cool we use
the tape to kind of like block me off
which I know it sounds weird because why
would you want to block yourself off for
a photo but we use it just for visuals
to make it a little bit more interesting
to look at so you can see the tape is
blurred and then I'm just like digging
through I'm just like creeping in the
back you're just super couch like doing
my mam just come over here chilling I
really like the idea cuz it kind of just
bruises it spruces when have I ever said
that spruce his up I don't little bit
more interesting it's a lookout so yeah
that was a cool idea - location full I
don't know what made me think of it but
I just thought what some kind of ugly
gross place my dad's van he's a builder
so actually can imagine in the back of
his van was just covered in tools
ladders hammers friggin shovels a lot
honestly in these photos I felt like I
was with fifth harmony in their music
video for work it was real okay and I
wanted to kind of sit on the edge with
all the tools in the background this is
the next shot off in this couple at the
park
get up say yeah yeah you would have
known that saying in the back of a
builders van could get me such a cool
ass photo I love this one it's just so
rustic and like kind of gross but like
kind of fun at the same time and then
the Sun because you know mother nature
was ruining the whole photo like
honestly like I was basically like half
ghost half normal it's my mom foot what
do you actually get another van
sit on the little stool that's in there
and just kind of like work with what you
got so of course Elliott using his
puppet ography skills and Gangnam and
got really cool shots you can kinda see
a little bit more of what's in the van
here like the ladders the tall thingies
what you think of these ones I think
they're really cool at how the hell
could the back of a van kind of look at
this edgy he would have known who would
have known the very last Oakley location
that we went to was actually a place
called next if you don't know what next
is it's basically like a home shop they
sell like furnitures and Gardens stuff
they sell like everything now the next
itself this is a beautiful ass it looks
good but if there is this bike shed that
is just way past its sell-by date and
looks like it's about to fall down any
minute it's really day there's like
scratches all unlike the plasticky glass
stuff I don't know what happened it was
so gross I cakes a bit that you've store
your bikes in we're covered in cobwebs
and the amount of times okay I put my
hand in copper crypts we decided to have
Elliott one side of the like plastic
glass and then meet inside the actual
shelter and even though the plastic
glass stuff was literally gross like
covered in dirt we thought we called to
kind of use it as a filler for the photo
yeah surprise will wish do excuse me
we'll have photo
these are the final five here this is so
weird because I kind of feel like I want
to like wipe the screen it's so cool how
you've got this like misty still or in
front of me from the guru says glass
just a bike shed nothing special about
it whatsoever and you can get a photo
like these do you know what I mean sorry
that is my attempt at the ugly location
a photo shoot challenge it was
definitely a challenge not gonna lie it
took a lot of angles and a lot of photos
that's for sure but so worth it so love
the way they turns out I love how
natural they looked you know what I mean
for anyone who enjoys taking photos or
just wants to do something with their
Instagram don't be afraid to use
locations that don't necessarily look
good to the eye straight away just work
