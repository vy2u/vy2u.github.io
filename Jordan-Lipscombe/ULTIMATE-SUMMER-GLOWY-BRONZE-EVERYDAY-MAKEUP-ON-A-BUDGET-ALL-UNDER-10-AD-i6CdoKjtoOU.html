packet again with another YouTube video
not only is this video gonna be me
showing you one of probably my favorite
looks to do ever summer skin makeup you
know really bronzy really glowy really
healthy looking you know minimal eyes
glossy lips it's just the perfect look
for summer but I'm introducing to you
guys a brand that has just come out with
makeup the best part is at a stroke
store and everything that about share
with you is under 10 pounds the brand is
called sunkissed yeah they've just
released a bunch of makeup of course
they're going for the whole point the
Chloe vibe so the makeup that I'm
wearing today this was by them this is
their products on my face the only thing
on my face that's not is the foundation
and also my lips but everything else is
them I'm kind of shook like this
highlight you kidding me like what the
Frick okay it means Sunkist did team up
to bring you guys this video which is
freaking exciting because honestly I
have genuine love for the products that
I'm about to show you and that excites
me because I get to share with you guys
and then hopefully you guys will love
them just as much as I do
they sent me like a little pink trunk
thing full of stuff which was so cute
loads of different types of products in
their bronzers blushes highlighters and
mascara and eye palette shimmer powders
saw it much stuff this look it's super
super simple to do I mean it's nothing
like revolutionary I'm sure you've seen
something like this before but I also
really want this to be a video that
shows you some bomb-ass products
basically add an affordable price you
know got a real gotta save them coins
anyway enough with the intro let's just
get into the video right now that my
hair is all out the way we can get to
the juicy stuff real quick before I
speak to you guys about the makeup I
have cause have to speak about you know
how Sunkist started let's begin at where
the fake tan
if you've been around these parts for a
little while now you'll know how much I
freaking love faked I like self-tanning
it's my jam on a/c fake tan light like
everyone's from a blood it's a muscle
but now for real I tan all the time
there is not a time pretty much that I
don't have it on it's literally just a
personal preference of mine I feel way
more confident in it I feel healthy I
feel glowing I just feel I feel good
this little guy right here and this is
what I'm wearing on my skin right now I
mean I've got freaking light bulbs in
front of me right now like all up in my
grill so I feel like on camera I don't
weigh like ah then I do in real life
it's kind of a little bit strange I
promise you I'm like it's hand because
guys some keys to ultra dark and it
listen anything ultra dark I'm like hell
we I like head-to-toe it husband on my
skin for like three days now though so
of course you know it is a little bit
you know not was like them as it was in
the beginning but of course they
captured furch of me applying it so you
guys can see how it goes on it is in
loose tan as well mousse towns are my
favorites one I love this one because as
a guide color which not only helps you
apply the town so you know you don't
miss any spots but it also gives you an
instant bronzy glow so you know you can
head out do your thing it definitely is
more of that kind of red based tan if
you know what I mean if you use fake tan
alot you know what I mean and also oh it
smells so good oh it smells like I don't
know smells good it's just real like
tropical when my okay now that I've
shared with you you know the skin let's
move to this kind of skin and makeup
guys I'm really excited to share these
products with you because the quality
for the price girl it's so so good and
you know I thought I'd have discovered
some chimps here that you need to know
about that's my usual I mean you
probably know how it goes down on this
you know I would not be showing my love
for these products if it wasn't genuine
because listen I'm not gonna sit here on
my shirt I'm not gonna waste my time if
I didn't genuinely love something it's
just not gonna be on my youtube channel
it's as simple as as you can probably
tell I do have a little bit of makeup on
right now I have brace voice base
products on right now so foundation
concealer powder but yeah I want to show
you my favorite things from their
collection brows okay right brows brows
perhaps I like a little brow products
like penciled Palmes powders it kind of
all just depends on my mood as it the
past like few months I've been loving
pencils I don't know why I find them the
quickest I like the way they look it's
just my thing and of course Sunkist have
a brow pencil this is their easy brow -
and why not brow pencil with brush and
I'm using the color medium - yeah oh
I've got some spoolie on one end that's
definitely on the spoolie okay that's
the pencil and it's wind-up I mean say
well whatever you say well and then of
course a spoolie so yeah I'm just gonna
come through these looking a little sad
at the moment they need uh a little bit
of help need a bit of TLC that's for
sure
so start underneath the brow you know
just kind of draw a line from the front
all the way to the tail and then I go
ahead and do the exact same thing on top
just to kind of get the shape and then I
just kind of fill it in you guys I don't
know I'm not like a pro with brows I
just kind of like do I like now I'm not
gonna lie this pencil is pretty damn
creamy like you know you can kind of
glides like it's a glider which you know
I'm not mad at it is normally the kind
of product though that I would like to
set with a powder i way prefer a
creamier pencil like this though to
something that's like very hard and
whack seeing you're like doing this for
about an hour and still nothing comes
out it means I can you know put product
for the front like this and then blend
out super super easy to get that
gradient and I'm not you know it gonna
look like I got a sharpie bro I really
like the color as well it's like not too
purple not too Orion just has that
really nice neutral and then to clean up
the brow I'm going to be using their CC
flawless base color correcting palette
so yeah inside you have color correcting
shades and then also skin tone shade
I'm gonna set this top one here and use
it to kind of just carve out my eyebrow
I don't particularly use palates you
know that have that more thicker
creamier consistency on my face
it's just not my vibe I prefer more of a
liquid concealer for my face bar to
carve out the brows to use as an
eyeshadow base like all of that this
kind of thing is perfect it's just like
the perfect consistency to really you
know get in there in okay so one brow is
done months ago why do we have to have
to browse you know do one you like it
better come out related in some way you
know sister cousin as long as we don't
look like an over family
wicket wish me luck ladies and gents
wish me luck and I tell you what this
little concealer covers up everything
like my life choice is sunkissed have a
crap-ton and when I say a crap-ton I
mean like a crap it's huh of products to
bronze up the skin I'd have to say this
one in here is probably my favorite this
is their bronze architect face Palin
inside you get a contour bronzer blush
and highlight this is basically
everything you need in life
oh the bronzer in here is honestly it's
the perfect amount of fill up my tan
skin I love a good orange EF bronze
some of you might be like it's not I
think for me obsessed I feel like the
colors in here are kind of dark but they
do have a carnival crush pink palette
which looks like this look at this
package in hello
sorry freaking cute and then in here
there are shades that I think will work
way better for lighter skin tones which
is fab but this little guy I'm using
today the packaging is hella Q as well
okay a little color moment here ronzo
blends out like a dream and I just I
feel instantly Bronston I'm just putting
this everywhere I would normally bronze
so temples she down here kind of like
that like three motion oh and also took
my nose see what I mean by that really
warm bronzy look which is what I love
I live for a live brief die for this now
of course there is you know blush
highlight everything in here but I do
want to show you more from the
collection I love so I'm gonna put this
little guy down but I'm gonna pick this
little guy up this is their make me
blush on berry blast desk you make it -
there we go how pretty is this I don't
know why but that is so satisfying to me
to look at like that I'm gonna stick to
the lighter colors down here that's
typically you know wide go for and then
just throws a your the cheeks it kind of
like gives your cheek a bit of a glow as
well it's such a pretty color it's that
perfect pink peach kind of color that
goes with so many looks and just look so
you know natural like a flasher color
love it it is time for the glow
okay this product - the baked to
perfection blush highlight duo this
isn't playing around you have like a
champagne e golden e highlight at the
top and then you have a blush which is
like super glowy as well I don't know if
you guys are ready for this I'm just
sticking to the highlight side ah you
freaking kidding me right now like but
we need to like right and appreciate
because that is some serious quarter
hoot you know what I love as well it
does not look like a strip on the skin I
mean this it genuinely just melts into
the skin I don't know what they put in
this but it's freaking bomb you guys
know I love highlighter so I'm not gonna
lie this is probably my favorite product
in the collection like this is a
must-have for me so for the eyes I want
to do something pretty simple easy to do
you know kind of that fresh face look
perfect for summer but you know I saw
had like a little something you know
going on so I'm actually gonna go back
in with the bronze architect palette and
take the bronzer just like we brush for
feet brush I love using the bronzer I
used on my face on my eyes I don't know
why I just felt like it looks so natural
fill in that in they do actually have
that I shadow palette which I'm about to
use in a sec bar it hasn't in matte
shades in it so I kind of like to use a
matte bronzer before hand you know just
to kind of get the look going get it
started get it the juices flowing good
geenie but underneath my eye as well
just a quick one-two one-two well here
is the palette that I was talking about
a second ago this is that I must have
see what you did there I must have I
must have I shadow in highlight palette
so this is what it looks like this is so
cool for a drugstore palette there is
just like lesson shades in here like I
said all of them have a slight shimmer
to them and then you have these two
little shades a pigment in these shadows
as well is so amazing look at that that
show right there that's speaking to me
let me take the shake here on my finger
can you use one I gave me and just place
that on ah it has like a slight shimmer
to it as well so it gives the eye a bit
of dimension then into the crease let me
see how easy that blended out same thing
to this I'm gonna take the color above
it just put that on top it's more like a
cool tone deep cool tone D English it's
got less warmth through it but it still
gives that like bronzed e5 and then the
white shade here I'm just gonna use that
too wow that is so pretty
look how bright that is this is just
gonna like open up the eyes and yeah I
really like that like it's so so simple
but it looks really put together this is
like a really really easy everyday look
for sure this iPilot for me is like I'd
call it like a finishing off palette
there's no matte shade so I kind of have
to start off with the bronzer but then
put this on to like finish off the look
jobs are good and we're gonna do
something a little bit different for me
today you know how much I love my
falsies but I want to keep this super
kind of that everyday summer
blondie glowy situation you know so
we're just gonna kick it with some
mascara today it's all we're gonna do
I'm gonna use the Sunkist mega bold lash
mascara this one as well is actually a
waterproof formula so girl my lashes are
gonna be on all day the wand on this
I feel like I actually beat you Gary
but for real though look at that wand
that's like the mother of all mothers
this is my favorite kind of wand you
know the more kind of plasticy
applicators rather than like the fuzzy
little one who's this is more plastic
which I prefer I feel like I get more
products on my lashes and that's what I
want especially when I'm not wearing
falsies look what this mascara does to
my lashes ignore the little bits of
mascara honestly you could give me the
smallest mascara wand in the world and I
would still managed to get mascara like
oh my god my lashes are looking long
okay so I am back what I did off camera
was apply a nude gloss see a lip they do
actually have a cute little lip palette
was like a ton of shades as I closed and
nude options in there and stuff but I
don't actually have it with me so I
couldn't use it but they do have that
option if you're interested sorry well
all that's left is the little finishing
touches so of course we want to have
this all set in place so it doesn't move
some kids have their own a little saying
miss this is the perfect fix perfect
perfect fix pass perfect perfect and
this is oil control which you know I
need it so give it a little shade I feel
like when I setting spray sounds like
this you know that probably not you know
it's a good one like you know you're not
about to drown this has a little bit of
a smell by the way it kind of smells
it's really faint like really so I don't
even know basically it's nothing great
the look is complete I am real happy
with where everything looks on my skin
and I can't believe that all these
products are under 10 pounds but my mind
is actually blowing all products I use
