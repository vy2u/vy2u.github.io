something that I know you guys really
wanted to see and I'm super excited
about it it is on this look okay I felt
like this was just the ultimate like wet
look like when the care whether it stays
well it's skin I'm getting kind of Kim K
lies on this anyone else it's kind of
like a get ready with me type the video
I show you how did this make up the hair
and also like the glow on the skin and
it's probably way is there anything like
I'm pressin any of you can do this I
believe in you if you do want to know
how I did this situation everything
that's going on right now then just keep
watching okay I swear every single time
I do my makeup looks I always start by
just looking like an egg then I want a
scoop of cool I'm just going to embrace
my Ignis so to start with to kind of
prep my skin I'm going to use at this so
this is going to kind of moisturize
prime this is easy for Sally so Sally I
don't for Sally so Sally and Sally Baker
throughout that videos no idea how you
pronounce his stuff but it's basically
rose gold elixir 24k gold infused Beauty
oil this is so extra icon it has legit
got bits or distress bits of gold on it
on it in it you know what I mean this
really moisturizes my skin though
absolutely it smells amazing too like
it's pretty pricey but I think nothing I
hope you hate that when you lost me but
it's like so expensive and you're like
that has literally hurt my insides a
little bit next is foundation so I use
the makeup of our Ultra HD foundation
stick I love this stuff it has amazing
coverage but I have so much glow to it
as well and it looks like on the skin
basically it just looks amazing cover up
that huge melting that's like literally
forming or minute I literally hate that
when you wake up with like a huge phone
your facial I think you're not going to
sleep with you where have you formed
from I'm starting off with a brush to
apply it first and then I go in with a
sponge just to pick up any excess
products I feel like this product
actually works better with a brush I
just dip it on like this and then hit
that double chin
you know the glow is real right now can
you see this I'm Makenna hello Joey for
my concealer I used the new benefit
Boeing airbrush concealer this stuff
guys this looks so good on your skin I'm
in number two by the way also it's a
mini booty blunder is this not the
cutest thing you've ever seen in your
life because I'm applying it with a
brush first and then I'll end out with
their baby booties lend us get me usual
spots with this I feel like you guys
have seen me do this so many times
understand oh I actually really love the
mini one so underneath my eyes like it
can get right in here and I feel like I
have more control I don't know why my
hand something need to do that this
concealer is like so creamy that it
blends out so well I'm using a product
that I haven't used in ages I used to
use it all the time and then I just were
trying other things where stop the
ass you made no color powder a little
bit of that on my sponge and just all
sudden underneath my eyes I have to set
this instantly otherwise it creases like
a little beeyotch I'm saying the rest of
my face with this powder as well just to
take away some of that shine and also to
make sure that my face is not going to
move get in between them brows go I used
our better stick around by the way to
fill in my eyebrows if you were
wondering I love that start every good
bronzer did I use I used the makeup ever
Pro bronze of fusion I know I've been
using this quite a lot in my recent
makeup looks but when you find something
that you love you kind of just stick to
it and I'm going for that favor right
now so I'm going to use it
I'm sorry swirl that in I'm gonna go to
town oh I came here okay yep I am NOT
being shy with the bronzer Eve I really
want to be really bronzed in glory so
I'm just going on go in huh whatever
left on the brush I always take like on
the tip of my nose and stuff because I
always feel like my nose gets lost like
this color everywhere like pop them here
and then I just have like no nose but
I'm older more I think we are all good
with the bronzer now I'm going to add a
little bit of contour on one case we'll
try and shape this a little bit even
though I
do have the welcome in your face a girl
control okay real talk I have not put
this thing down since I receive this in
my peer box like holy crap
this is the abdicate maked skin at
shapeshifter planets are basically one
side you have like powder contours and
highlights pull this down and you have
creams
I haven't actually touched the creams
yet but I have been using these two
shapes here to contour I mix these two
shades together because this one's just
a little bit too cool for my skin tone
for what I prefer and I will say this
one is multiple bronzers bit too warm so
you mix them together perfect show you I
do actually it's apples the excess as
well because this is pigmented and then
for contour don't know about you guys
but I actually pull back my hairline
with this hand like this so I can like
get it snatched turn through in snatch
it back hopefully you can see there's
just a little bit more definition on my
face I mean I've gone a little little
cray with the consult adapter on quite a
bit didn't even mean to but I mean
they're cool they're cool for my blush
I'm using one from this anyway it luxe
bashful palette trio singing look how
pretty these colors I'm actually going
in with this orange color so I'm going
to keep everything quite warm again just
happen in it lightly and then putting it
on my teeth it's such a pretty color
absolutely look if you've been here a
while you know I'm not like the biggest
blush girl but if it's like peachy and
more warm than I'm feeling it I also
bring me blush like back here as well
not only to blend it in with my bronzer
and stuff but also to kind of pull my
face back a little bit so if you just
took color here it's going to bring the
attention there and make your face look
more round which I mean I don't need
that all got me talking I can do what
I'm doing when really I just like to
things on the face or not the globe I'm
using one my favorite drugstore
highlighters ever like this is one of
the best drugstore ones you will ever
try like I promise you well it is the
sleek Cleopatra's kiss highlighter
palette the softest one is really good
as well but this one is just more kind
of golden and bronzing and going in with
this one and this one which IV - what
powder shades and guys you do not need
to wet your brush with this like watch
this
but come on Dow
are you kidding me like a look at you
well now you guys know I do enjoy a nice
high-end product but drugs are to me
just as good and I thought like
highlighters one of those products where
you literally don't need to buy
something high-end like taking a
tenement and just going to put it above
my eyebrows just ever so slightly and
then I take my blue blender I just make
sure I press the highlighter into the
skin so it just really sort of melts it
in and make sure there's no edges or
anything I'm going to spray this on my
skin now just to get rid of any powder
enos or anything just everything sells
in I usually do that with my six plus
but I feel like this is the same this is
the body shop vitamin e hydrating face
mist and even says on the back helps fix
makeup so it's actually meant for this
as well don't think a lot of people know
that so let people use this jot on their
bare face but you can actually use this
to like settle down your makeup so that
this is actually I'm going to do oh when
my top guy let me get movin on to eyes
now I'm going to go ahead and prime then
with the under K naked skin weightless
complete coverage concealer be a longest
name ever this is probably my favorite
thing to find my eyes with because I was
a really really good coverage and it
makes it a base for my students so good
maybe I don't know why I made that face
and although this is the eyeshadow
palette that I'm using it's the NYX
lingerie shadow palette I think that's
going to take this sheet here and just
set my lids with this just sort of
increasing and then I should only blend
way better I'm now taking the orange I'm
going to put that in at my crease
this is going to act kind of as our
transition color going in the crease
above the crease keeping them in it out
I'm making sure to hit this outer corner
as well I usually mess this I don't and
why should I send them I'm actually so
happy that you guys want to see this
look because if I could describe myself
in a look it would be that like
something really glowy where look hair
just everything looking really like wet
no it actually makes this one and this
one together for the lid two part in
these little side now I'm actually
trying to keep my makeup looks on my
channel relatively easy to do like more
realistic because I know that sometimes
you can watch a makeup tutorial and you
can kind of be like what the hell am i
doing in the class I'm not a makeup
artist you guys you know I'm only
capable of so much as well and I'm
nowhere near just hop in a game with
makeup like I just do the looks I want
to do and then it for the best I take
them same colors and put them under my
lash line this brush fits so perfectly
underneath my eyes it's like it is the
spectrum a one two brush it's perfect
oh hello if think I went a little bit
heavy-handed there oops I'm just going
ahead now I'm cutting on it from a scar
on painting benefit roller lash which is
and my absolute save I didn't wear any
falsies in this look I let you just wore
mascara oh darn it what am I like
carefully look at how freaking good this
is Guara makes my lashes a little
pissants a business car is so easy
because it has length and volume at the
same time I swear it's like a mascara on
this eyes well I'm gonna be like I just
have to get mascara on this one little
mascara trick to make your lashes look
longer take the wand and basically apply
some on the tips at the back of the
lashes like this and actually extend
them and makes it look a little bit
longer adding some to my bottom
eyelashes as well not too much just a
little coat now the last thing to do on
and my face is ellipses so I was very
like and
live in the picture but it looks kind of
like golden e metallicky and looked
glossies so I'm going to show you how I
did that start up with this Oprah liquid
lipstick in Sao Paulo impression that's
how you say it I probably just lifted
that otherwise I would definitely
recommend a liquid lipstick rather than
a normal lipstick because the product
that we're going to put on top doesn't
really work with a lipstick so you need
something that sort dries down and
sealed in for them to dry the product
that I put on top of is to make it look
glossy wasn't actually a gloss now
sometimes I don't actually like wearing
glasses cuz I'm hanging it soaking it
and I'm like just sometimes I am going
to gloss girl but just sometimes I'm not
feeling it so I actually found a little
trick I found a product that makes your
lips look really metallic really glossy
but without the like the gloss it is
this little guy this would be an X
liquid a liquid lip liner in Jem it's
this amazing like copper gold is
basically just like metallic liquid oh
can you guys see that
as you can see my lips look like they're
glassy bar there's literally no transfer
whatever it drives down maps that last a
really long time and the last thing to
do is go ahead and okay brace and second
spray this on indeed Photoshop one now I
want to show you guys how I get my body
to glow how I get it to look kind of wet
the product that you need for this like
honestly I feel like if you have to have
one highlighter this is what you need in
your life
the iconic London illuminator drops the
reason why I feel like you need these is
because you can use these on your face
on your body and because it's a liquid
there's no glitter or any whatsoever so
it literally looks wet it's so good for
me personally I'm going to go ahead and
mix two together so this was the
original and this is the glow one
because I am tan I can get away with
adding in some of the darker drops so
like actually makes me look more tanned
and more glowy when I do this
and there is one step even like to the
necessary chore pink so putting the
original drops on the back or my hands
and then I'm going to go ahead and mix
in a couple of drops of the darker one
as you can see I have all this sort of
bronzy champagne color so I'm just clear
what take a brush any one will do dip it
in and I'm just going to go ahead and
apply it to my shoulders here my
collarbones basically just like the main
point starts when the light hits is like
it's the collarbones as well and then
whatever celebration is going to go in
and take on this main part of my chest
here just to give it a little subtle Sun
some just you know in the photo I did
actually go ahead and set this with a
powder highlight just to make sure that
it lasts way longer if I was going out
or something I'll do that I hope I do
that right out from underneath these
lights and it looks prettier pretty
intensive it is the last thing for me to
show you is my hair so in the photo it
was of all like scrotes back like this
and it's all wet first thing I did as I
went ahead and roughly wave my hair to
give it a little bit of texture so it's
not like dead straight I use this to do
it so curling one a finally easiest to
do because the curl that has to be
perfect you just really really quickly
wrap it around hold it for a few seconds
let it go and then you just get a load
of texture I also go ahead and make sure
that I alternate the way that the curls
goes to somewhere do towards my face and
I do away just remember as well this
really does just have to be rough
because we are going to kind of like
mess it up this is just a sort of add
some texture to our hair my hope is in
the waist and the next steps you're
going to need these two things and
fastening is the mousse any mousse will
do it really doesn't matter and then
this is just water by the way this is
not the NYX primer spray it was empty so
I'm just ratchet and foot it before
going to start spraying water in like
the root portion of my hair so I can
start scraping with her but don't be
afraid Eva to be pretty like liberals
set the word basically use don't be
afraid to your hair down switching over
to the mousse but basically what the
mousse is going to do because we do
still want to keep the kind of curl if
you add enough of this you just kind of
craps on this it will look we're all
just going to stop scrunching it into my
hair and I'm going like all the way up
to my room as well
as you can see the ends of my hair now
actually look wet and that's just with
the mousse if you apply enough it will
look wet also make sure you do apply the
mousse and the waters of the water will
dry as the mousse will dry into your
hair and it will stay looking wet which
is why you want to try and get the
mousse of close to your roots as
possible so that it stays a little wet
and then you just want to start to
scrape it back where it's wet it should
just naturally like stay back and that
is literally how I do that her so that
is literally how I get this overall sort
of wet look wet skin at wear has
actually easier then you probably saw I
really really hope that you guys enjoyed
