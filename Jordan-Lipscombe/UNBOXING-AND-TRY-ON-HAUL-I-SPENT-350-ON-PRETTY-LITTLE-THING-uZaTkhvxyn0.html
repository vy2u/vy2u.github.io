all doing really well so today's video
is hopefully the start of a brand new
series that I want to start on my Chanel
I've been seeing these kind of videos
floating around the tube and I'm gonna
do more kind of Clayton videos on my
channel and obviously every now and
again I want to switch up rather than
just being like whole whole whole whole
oh no I think there's anything wrong
with that I just I just I just want to
switch up every now and again on my
channel and do something different for
you pretty much the whole idea of this
is I choose a clothing website obviously
it will switch up every single time I do
this and I spend a crap-ton awning but
instead of me just doing a whole video
of the pieces that I really like we're
just gonna unbox the entire thing on
camera
try it on live first impressions keeping
it real and then I tell you guys whether
I think it was worth spending the dollar
on so you know you go when I'm pretty
little thing if you've been here a while
you'll know that pre door thing is
definitely in my like top free at
favorite clothing stores like the vibe
of them it's so me their stuff is just
like on plain or like keeping it real
with everything comes it flops so we're
gonna find out whether or not this was
worth me spending my money on so kick
start with a pretty little thing before
we get started though I'm gonna give you
guys a little bit of information about
shipping and my like experience on their
website and stuff Before we jump into
trying these bits on oh sorry
let's go so I spent just under 350
pounds that happened my overall
experience off the website
I mean I've shops on there before but
everything's fab I love the layout
everything is really really clear do you
think it's sometimes that ish can freeze
like it freezes and you're just set
there like but that's only usually when
there's a high volume of people on the
websites like that's chill in my opinion
is a pretty average priced website I
think like it's not like hella expensive
and it's not hella cheap it's just
somewhere in between shipping options
are fab and they're shipping as fab as
well like if you click Next Day you are
gonna get it next day I've never not had
that so let's open up
this parcel I have a lot of clothes damn
I think I need but probably don't okay
let's get into trying this ash on the
first thing I have is the green thing
well my explanations I will put a
picture right here so you can see what
did it like on the model will I look
like that we're gonna find out this is
cute I yeah I got in a large because I
wanna throw up at the t-shirt dressing
clays yes this is nice you know this is
that like throne comfy I'm gonna see
feeling this like it's the perfect lamp
it's not too long you know in some
dresses like this bin bag this is like a
nice legs the booties covered but you
know we still got a little bit of leg
thumbs up from me yes this is just like
my kind of style as well I love it yeah
next item oh I don't use are these are a
pair of red trousers red high-waisted
track trousers these are nice if you
guys know me rent is literally one of my
favorite colors and I love the black
stripes down the legs let's try these on
these are nice oh yeah pine wearing a
little top because otherwise would be
half naked like no one wants to see
anything
no one wants to see the apples in the
bags but how cute are these though
they're not an akin material they have
more like thickness to them if that
makes sense
now should come to a really nice length
as well like just above your ankle but
there's no like bunched up nurse at the
bottom no matter what position I'm in
there's no weird vagina crease thing
going on there's just like no fake camel
toe thing which you girls a fan of oh
what's there is this that dress yes oh
my god this looks snatched this was one
of the more expensive items it was 40
pounds but I'm telling you guys already
just from feeling at the corner a that's
40 pounds for the quality you feel me
it's bandage material you know how it's
been about bandaged things like they
just suck you in and like all the right
places if this dress it's not just like
boo gif I don't know what is okay
this dress isn't making me look like
I've boobs definitely don't it's just
like made in all the right ways like the
two lines here going like the other way
vertically
no horizontally bring you in in the
middle hair like this is sort of one of
those like illusion dresses so you want
to know while we've all gotta fake it to
make a sometim it's fine obviously feel
so secure I'm not worried about a nip
slip
I've got worried about like third baby
I'm not saying I look good in this dress
but like the dress makes me feel good
you know
I mean pretty your thing you've done it
once again your knit booty what if we
gaps here oh this is that like white
denim skirt this is what it looks like
on the model if you didn't know I have a
little bit of a unhealthy obsession with
denim like skirts you know I have them
in blue I have them in black and Harley
on either day and white as well oh my
god I think it's broken
what just like goes up and down here
like it's not attached to this half with
the zip it was going to sew about I also
picked up this white bodysuit as well
how cute is this it says dole on the
front guys this guy is just like you no
no
suck it in girl just doesn't want to go
up I mean I can't do it up it's fine I
just fixed my receipt and I got a six
and this guy turned on eight
why did I do that because I'm actually
an 8 so I like that's my bad I actually
really like it though I mean it's a
shame that doesn't do our fun this is
well like this is cute
this come in other colors I'm pretty
sure a pink and a black but I picked up
the white because typically white is
more see-through so I went to test the
cifra nurse the cifra test is pretty
much pops you can kind of see my black
bar for it the Potter white bra and like
you're good to go
that actually comes up know some high on
the sides and the best part about this
it's a thong bodysuit which means no
dpl's no one likes of epo you know not
me this is nice though wider than this
fit I do really like the rips in the
denim as well I think looks really cool
you know a little bit this all-white
combo as well the abadi suit was 15
pounds which to be fair that's a pretty
good price and the skirt was 22 again I
would pay fo for them prices I'm a
little bit guy but this this is broken
bar hey what can you do are to the
what do we have here oh this feels so
nice oh yeah this is the own jumpsuit
I'm excited for this because you go she
loves a good jump suit oh my god already
I can tell this so comfortable oh my god
yes yes yes yes yes I'm obsessed with
this this is hands-down one of my
favorite things I've tried yeah nobody
cheeky underboob going on here no matter
if you can like put it down
so you have like no underboob I'm gonna
put it down low because like paws up
sets so much younger you guys I'm
obsessed with the bottom of these like
the kind of flair now if you can see I
mean you're see like in the model bar
can I just say as well this material
honestly feels like I'm going out in my
pajamas it's legit that comfortable and
it's the perfect material as well
doesn't give you pack a cup you know it
doesn't like push down on the budae but
will give you pop in home drinkin I
don't have a bottom I need to get my ass
back on the gym because then it starts
some squats this was 25 pounds as well
and I'm more than happy to pay it up for
this blow their thumbs up from me for
sure oh yeah
ordering this I'm super excited for this
this is something really different for
me it is a midi skirt I never wear mini
skirts because I'm quite short well I'm
not short on that average starts in like
five four five I never wear them because
I film it they made me look even shorter
like a little stunt but I saw this one
with the white stripes down the side and
it was part of their shape connection
they have this collection collection
can I speak English which is
specifically designed for like hourglass
shape so if you have like some hips a
little bit and I was like hey because of
that I feel like it's gonna fit nicely
I'm not gonna lie though I wasn't
expecting this kind of material it's not
like stretchy thin jersey I was
expecting a little bit more a little bit
more from that but how much was this it
was 15 pounds so I mean for 15 pounds I
don't know if the quality says that but
we gotta try off we're gonna try it out
because you know what kind of take it
back this looks cute this is like classy
but like I'm still a thought okay here's
my thing you know I think the quality
could be better for 15 pounds 100% it is
just like a thin Jersey material however
is it flaring in does a lip balm
yeah but then the Jersey Couture is
really comfortable so
I don't know but then I guess as well
J'son material kind of want that look at
me
you kind of want that stretch especially
if it goes past your knees like you want
to be able to walk you know you don't to
be like pencil you know what well
considering this is midi-length I don't
feel like a stump I just don't
this is kid hey hey I mean overall I
might have with it yeah
should it be 15 I reckon it should be
more about 10 pounds I'm being picky but
like it's my job no I'm failing this one
oh yeah let's try this while we're here
this is a white is this why that is
definitely more of an ivory color if I
can head up to the white denim skirt and
if you guys can see that this is more
ivory slap oh okay so this is a denim
jacket
this looks good guys I picked this up in
a size 12 like that was all they had in
the website and I was like f err it's
fine I like oversized saying as I guess
caught oppa this does not look like a
size 12
okay 100% this is not size 12
like this is fitted to me which is fine
because it fits me but I'm a size 8 so
if you're looking for something
oversized you're gonna have to like for
King goes like the biggest size ever but
it's really comfortable really
lightweight does it feel like I'm
wearing a denim jacket to be honest it's
really thin like a Ricky in denim but
how cute is the writing on this though
it says she who dreams conquers the
world yes and then on here it says
trends my you know what I'm not mad at
there's 24 powers that actually isn't
bad usually 10 of like a surprise from
like 40 to 50 pounds so I find this is
priced right here's the right in like a
little bit closer up so you can see it
the right it is a hundred percent what
made me want this ended up here
wasn't it like if I said this oh my god
you can still see the right end even if
I wear off the shoulder if you've been
here a while you know I love to wear my
jackets like this it's just like a thing
for me next thing is it's this dress
okay like instantly I feel like I feel
like this is just not gonna be a vibe on
the model this looks bangin like this
looks so nice like a soft sporty vibe
little dress like as I'm holding this up
it just hasn't no shape to it looks
really long and the sleeves is that
really no more is that this pretty look
at the sick Riley so yeah
just hangers times this is the smallest
size as well this was 18 pounds as well
18 pounds I don't mean to be rude
horrible but like this just doesn't look
good on me this is just no the material
as well like is that jazzy one again
don't look straight I don't really have
anything else to say right now I'm so
excited to try this on I want to try
something from that premium range
because I wanted to see if the price
matches up to the quality feels really
nice this was at 50 pounds but there is
like a bunch of embroidery on it and it
feels nice it was nice I
of this how freaking pretty is this
dress I'd like as well because I know
it's 50 pounds it just feels like nice
quality you know what I mean I can fit
as well this top bit I mean this is time
girls and boy so this is not going to
fall down anytime soon
so no one boob accidents were they okay
really nice length as well like my ass
is not I love the color combination as
well like the green with the girl in the
black again winner winner chicken dinner
love it 50 pounds but up next this is
little like white top as far as I can
remember it kind of ties at the front
and it was 22 pounds this is kind of
cool eh I love the sleeves I feel like
the material as well is really nice it's
kind of it might have sat in but it's
not super shiny like satin but it's
really like soft but I thought it would
tie a bit at the front also can I just
say I'm wearing a bra you can't even see
the bra usually with these kind of tops
you can see if you can fern you're like
oh not gonna lie though it's a tiny bit
seafront and kind of see my bra peeking
through it's not bad or anything I'm
just like close up the mirror so I can
see I'm a fan of this FA and 20 mm steel
chair as well I'm happy with that I'm
happy to pay at that price like TEVAR
money and then we have I think this is
another little top yeah it's this little
green one okay it is this I'm pretty
sure this was 12 pounds and it just
feels like a little stretchy basic kind
of top it's just a pretty standard
little crop top to be honest I really
like the color and I love the stripes on
the side it kind of adds a bit of a
sporty vibe like I said it is just a
pretty standard cami top to be honest
but I love little things like this it
goes with everything I mean you kind of
can't go wrong with a little cami top
like they're so big I was happy oh I
told you support I picked this up this
is a little blue skirt it looks really
big though does that look big or is that
just me this is a size 8 as well the
material of this though is so nice it's
like satin then it has these of metallic
flowers all over it really like oriental
I feel like please just ignore the fact
that I'm literally pairing everything
with this little top it just goes with
everything it's
easy for me to throw on so okay so first
off this is where it should say this is
where it goes
I could tell anyway this was gonna be
way too big but look I can legit just
pinch this whole entire thing at the
back this would look so nice but it's
just like so yeah it's just super larynx
is way too big look look that looks
wrong
shouldn't do that just basically want to
show you that I can fit my entire arm
don't miss go it's just like this would
be really nice if it actually fit me
which is my bad but I should know it's
not my bad because I'm typically a size
eight so you should actually slice down
with this if you like it if you like it
I don't know also what's really nice
comes with the matching top as well it
was 22 pounds as well which for the
quality of this is really nice this
looks hella expensive why don't you look
like this
the very last thing I have is this
laughs okay
so hmm I think what drew me into this
was the yellow because I'm obsessed with
yellow I don't know you know when you
buy something and then you get it and
you're like why did I buy this I'm kind
of feeling like that now but quality is
really nice but it's just does it look a
bit like a farmer's sure I kind of feel
like I'm wearing my boyfriend shirt by
the same time I kind of like that
something's not working for me here
though right now maybe if a little maybe
like under the collar as well okay okay
and now I feel like we're working with
something yeah for sure for sure okay I
think I've made it work darling it like
this for me just adds more like a cash
vibe and I just feel like it's moving me
I know what do you guys think I kind of
like here maybe has some shape to it
it's not just straight down I feel like
there's just something about it which is
like fitting how much was this really
quickly just to give you guys the info
it was 25 pounds which that's fine and
it's a nice length
so like the colors okay so first of all
I apologize for looking like a hot mess
right now honestly I feel I'm a makeup
is down here I'm sweating honestly
triangle so many clothes makes me break
out as well
okay so my overall thoughts I'm pretty
impressed I mean I've ordered from there
before so I kind of have a feel for them
but I'm know today there was only a few
things which I was like you go but are
there I am super happy with I'm only
gonna be sending a couple of things back
but I've got some good additions to my
wardrobe so do I think pretty little
thing is worth it I would say so it
still is one of my favorite shops when I
make an order with them I either like
everything or there's only ever one or
two pieces which I'm like so I think
that's pretty good going so do I
recommend perennial thing yeah a hundred
cents so that is everything from me if
