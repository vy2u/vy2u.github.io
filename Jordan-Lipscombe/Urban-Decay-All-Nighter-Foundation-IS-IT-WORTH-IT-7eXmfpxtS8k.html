going to be a review on the new open
decay all nighter liquid foundation now
I have heard some amazing things about
this and I've read all the claims and
pretty much this foundation does
everything well supposedly does
everything that I would want from a
foundation so if this does what it says
I'm sold so pretty much the five main
points of this is full coverage long
wear matte finish
waterproof and oil-free then on the back
it says the sports performative provides
complete coverage that lasts all day or
all night with a modern matte finish
that never looks overdone revolutionary
formula is also comfortable enough to
wear every day and we loaded this full
coverage foundation with such an insane
amount of pigment that a little what
goes a long way
there's no need to build your coverage
or apply multiple layers and then it
also says high-tech ingredients that are
mattifying absorb to reduce the
appearance of shine so I mean it's safe
to say that I'm excited to try this so
this is what the packaging looks like I
love the bottle it's just like in this
silver metallic bottle and then through
the little design on the front you can
actually see the product and it's one of
those ones where basically the product
gets pushed up as you use it also by the
way it is one of those pumps that it
looks broken but it's not and that
basically is a design that allows you to
go out every bit of product it's not
broken don't worry now I was talking to
the lady in the shop about this and she
was saying that this is basically like a
gel foundation which pretty much means
once it's set on your face it doesn't
budge and so apparently dries quite
quickly so she said to work in smaller
sections at a time which I think I'm
going to do just to give you guys a
little bit of information about my skin
type if you're new here so it is kind of
combinational to be honest it's normal
everywhere except my t-zone is pretty
oily usually about three to four hours
into wearing a foundation I start to see
oil so we're gonna see if this can
control it longer than any other
foundation because the amount of what
foundation I use i always get oily and
it's so so frustrating so I'm prone this
well so in the UK this retails for well
I got mine for 27 pounds which obviously
is quite pricey for a foundation but if
it does what it says it does then I
think it will be totally worth it okay
so we're just going to go straight on it
to applying it so I'm going to prime
half of my skin and just to see if a
primer makes a difference I'm just using
the body shop
all-in-one instable ah I think I'm going
to prime this side of my skin I'm also
going to use a brush on one half of my
face and a sponge on the other just to
see if the application is different I
mean usually with any foundation of
brush tends to have a fuller coverage
and but a sponge might work with it that
I'm going to start with a pump of air as
you can see it's actually starting to
run down my hand I thought it was going
to be more of like a thick foundation
but it does seem to be running down so
I'm going to start with the sponge I
used about half of that pump also I am
in the shade 4.0 the point zero color
range is the more yellow toned okay so
I'm sure you guys can literally see
straight away how full coverage that is
like this side in comparison to this
side that's crazy
you can tell though that it dries down
pretty quickly because your actual
blending it out and it just sort of it
stays where it is if that makes sense
and now feeling it it doesn't feel tacky
or anything like that it literally just
feels like a cell my skin it definitely
is a matte finish as well which I don't
tend to go for but this is quite a nice
matte finish it's not flat or anything
like that that rhymed I'm just going to
go ahead now and use the brush on this
side by the way I'm using the Sigma 3d
HD kabuki brush to apply this
both sighs to be honest we're pretty
similar to me they both blend it out
really easily I don't prefer one tool
over the other I would say that if I'm
being kind of really picky the brush did
apply as a more fuller coverage just
ever so slightly but they both have the
same finish very similar coverages and
they look pretty similar to be honest
ignore my gross foundation lips and I
definitely recommend working in sections
at a time because you can feel the
Foundation's starting to dry as you're
working with it which can be a little
bit annoying but it's worth it because
the the finish looks good I'm going to
go ahead and do the rest of my makeup
and see how well makeup applies on top
of it and then I will be back to give
you guys a quick update okay so I am
back and I have to say I am loving at
this foundation at the moment the way
looks on the skin is just so so nice for
like a full coverage of foundation it
just looks so smooth on the skin it
doesn't look cakey up all all of the
products are used blended just so nicely
on top like the bronze are the blush the
highlight everything skin makeup wise
just went on so easy so quite honestly I
am so happy with this foundation at the
moment I mean obviously I need to wait
to see how it wears on the skin and
things like that but right now I'm kind
of obsessed so it is now one o'clock I
will come back in a few hours
to update you guys on how the foundation
is wearing use the Bamiyan I do use do
you know my cell phone
another hi
yep just filming myself yep there's a
car that Oh see this is why I don't blog
I get way too nervous literally as soon
as I put the camera up the whole like
world wants to walk past me anyway both
it is currently quarter past five so
it's been on for what just over four
hours so I am just doing the update from
my car right now because um I'm
currently out and I have to say the
foundation is actually looking really
really nice I am a teeny bit late but
honest II know any as much as I would be
wearing any other foundation I have
which is really good you guys can see
you can still see my highlight and my
bronzer and my blush everything is still
like on my face there's no kind of
fading anywhere or anything
obviously we're only four hours in so I
will leave it a few more hours and come
back but I just wanted to give you guys
an update because usually around this
time I start to kind of notice a big
change in my foundation and with this
one I can't notice anything so also I've
still got the foundation on the back of
my hand which I was going to rub off and
then I thought no I'm actually going to
leave on that I have noticed that it has
gone a little bit darker so just so you
guys know it has oxidized a tiny bit not
a lot it still matches me but it's not
awful it's like a completely different
shade or me or anything it's just
something to keep in mind so this is the
foundation in like natural lighting I'm
actually currently hanging out my car
window yeah so I'll be back in a few
more hours to give you guys another
update I will try to leave on for as
long as I can like an average kind of
day like a maybe eight hours plus button
will say I'll update you guys in a few
more hours to do the last update of the
day I am so ready to just take my makeup
off I'm soaking for just ripping off
these false eyelashes because I'm just
so tired so it is now 20 to 10:00 at
night so this has been on for what
nearly nine hours now which i think is a
pretty good kind of testing time for a
foundation
I have to say I am really really
impressed with this foundation and it
has faded a little bit my cheek area
here but I have been editing so I've
been just like laying on my face and I
am kind of oily as well however I'm oily
but the foundation hasn't broken up it
doesn't it like it's melting
it hasn't um faded or anything around my
nose it's pretty much on it just looks a
little bit oily if I put a little bit of
powder on I'm sure that would go in fact
should we try that let's try it yeah
that has totally taken away the shine
and the foundation looks amazing again
my nose area that's usually where I can
tell because the foundation usually at
this point has just completely slid off
and I basically have no makeup on my
nose either that or it looks super
patchy and grows nothing like literally
nothing I would go out with this I don't
feel like I need to touch up my makeup
or sort anything out I would literally
walk out the door like this I feel like
I've actually found a foundation that I
love is this foundation worth purchasing
100% um I actually think this is one of
my favorite foundations ever I agree
with every single claim on this box the
oil one I mean I agree with it it
definitely controlled my always longer
than any other foundation but I still
got all you with it I feel like that's
just gonna be the case with every single
foundation I have though because I have
oily skin um however it was easily thick
I love this just I mean just just go by
it just just get it you won't regret it
so that is literally all I have to say
about this foundation go by it you guys
