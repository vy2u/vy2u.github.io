really well and have been an awesome
week
really quickly find it really found in
this video it's because I've still got
the guide Colorado snowflakes and need
to wash off skills so just want to point
out so today's video is actually a
makeup tutorial and it is on the lip
that I am wearing right now it is
actually the look well it's very similar
to what I was wearing in my how I come
my hair to waves video got so many
requests to do the makeup I was wearing
and this is pretty much it it's just a
really really dark smokey eye with a
nude lip and in the main part of this
makeup though is definitely the like
chunky winged eyeliner that's just on
the out corner of the eye I don't know
it's just really like grungy and like a
bit of meat you know actually but like
this look would be perfect for
Valentine's Day as well you know just go
throw that one out there and whether
you're know going on a date night or
having a chilled Tuesday night you know
whatever you doing you can still rock
this doesn't matter what you're doing
you know where you're single taken other
than my like freaking interation shit
with food like me it's actually nothing
wrong with climbing yourself up so
anyway if you guys do want to see how I
create this look then just keep watching
okay guys so please excuse my voice the
time that I have to film this it's the
time that my voice decide to give up on
me so but all I'm doing first of all is
taking some concealer and just priming
my lids ready for eyeshadow
I'm then going in with my much like
violet floss Holy Grail palette this is
freaking incredible and I'm just going
in with thanks a lot a first I'm just
going to set the lid with this color and
then I'm going in with transition and
hashtag and we're just going to work
this into the crease literally as our
transition color being kind of sloppy
with this we will clean it all up later
and everything by working this from
outer corner all the way to inner corner
and then going in with the color brownie
points-- and I'm just going to pack this
onto the outer corner and then blend it
out with a blending brush this is just
going to help the lid color where it's
so dark it's just going to help it blend
out a lot easier so we save a little bit
of time and also save our arm from from
dying a second now going in with teddy
bear which is like a dark pearly brown
I'm going to of course pack this onto
the lid I put on in the decided height
I'm going to spray my brush and go in
again just to the colors even more
intense that's better so yeah I'm just
going to pack this all over the lid
again it doesn't have to be perfect
because we will of course be blending
everything together everything looks
seamless in the end so just pack this on
and then take a fluffy Brenden brush and
literally just keep blending and
blending and blending
you just want to keep packing on color
and blending it out to get it as intense
as you like don't worry about the edges
will clean up in a sec as you guys can
see our glass camera come back and those
eyes are done so I'm just taking a wipe
and cleaning up that edge to create a
really sharp line this is not only going
to make it look really clean it's going
to help with our wings eyeliner in a
second and then I'm just taking the
bodyshop liquid eyeliner and I'm just
going to start creating the wing so I'll
just follow that line bring it back into
like a third of the way into the eye
fill that in and just keep perfecting it
to get it how I personally like it I
like it to be quite thick and chunky on
the outer corner personally one thing I
will say there is a take the eyeliner
right onto the outer corner maybe even a
little bit further just so when I blend
I shadow underneath my eye just
seamlessly blends into the wing if that
makes sense
and then I'm just going in with a quick
coat of mascara as per usual just any
mascara will do it's just to help blend
them into the full Sam's because I will
be applying false lashes the lashes that
I'm using I think they are the backstage
lashes in Rodeo Drive don't quote me on
that I've only been description box are
checked out I will double-check and
leave it down there
and as you guys can see they're just
really sick and fluttery I'm obsessed
with these are born them so much but now
I'm going to move on to the skin so I'm
taking a benefit Porefessional primer
this is literally one of my favorite
primers ever loved it I'm just going to
pop this onto my t-zone area and then
for my foundation I'm using the Marc
Jacobs remarkable and renew got this all
over my skin you only need a small
amount of this because trust me a little
bit of this stuff goes a freakin a long
way it's so good I love this foundation
and I'm just taking my sponge I think
this is a nun cheese buns and I'm just
going to learn that all over my skin
stana for my concealer I'm taking my la
girl Pro conceal and I'm just putting
this in the usual places so underneath
my eyes and then highlight the rest of
my face so Cupid's bow chin middle of my
nose and my forehead
and then I'm just going back in with my
sponge and just blending everything out
I'm then going in with my cote airspun a
translucent extra coverage powder just
to bake and set my face honestly I love
this powder so much it is so so good
smells kind of weird not going to lie
but it does the job I'm so I'm just
packing this underneath my eyes and then
whatever's left in the lid I'm just
going to take that on a brush and just
set the rest of my face and then after a
couple minutes I'm just going to adjust
our way usually while it's baking I'll
do my eyebrows or something but I did
them before this video just to save a
little bit of time but now I'm just
going to add some color back into my
skin I'm using the body shop honey
bronzer to do this I love this bronzer
and I'm just putting that around the
perimeter of my face
I'm then taking the Anastasia of Beverly
Hills I think this is like a little
single pro quant or resourcing I don't
know I think it's in the color form and
I'm just going to use that to contour my
face as you can see the difference
already isn't saying also I have been
loving like a big fan brush to do this
makes it so quick so easy and everything
just blends out and doesn't it muddy I
just love it now for my favorite blush
ever Milani Luminoso I'm just going to
pop this onto my cheeks just add a
little bit more color
and then it's to highlight my skin and
just add a little bit more dimension I'm
taking the cover FX highlighter in
moonlight and just putting that in the
usual places
and then just to go back to the eyes I'm
thinking teddy bear which is the shade
we used all over our lids and I'm just
buffing that underneath my eyes and then
I take a fluffy blending brush and take
the colors transition and hashtag which
we're the ones we used as a very very
beginning and I'm just using that to
bust out even further taking it quite
low because I want it to be kind of
really really smoky this is just me
showing you guys I took a black kohl
pencil on top black in my waterline it
was kind of hard to show on camera so
and then I took some mascara on my
bottom lashes this one is the NYX double
stacked mascara which I've been obsessed
with like look how long it makes my
bottom lashes like it's kind of crazy
and then I'm going on to my lips so this
lip liner is I think it's a makeup
revolution lip kit lip liner in the
shade Noble and I'm just of course
lining my lips and then to fill in my
lips
I took a NYX lingerie liquid lipstick in
it the color push-up and just pop that
on
and then I took me NYX soft matte lip
cream in Cairo Cairo I'm not sure how
you say it but I just took that to
finish off the lips so this is the
completed look also I just wanted to
mention I actually get a lot of
questions about the music that I use in
my videos adore easily where I find my
music in the description box below but
this one in particular I want to mention
because it's something a little bit
different so basically the one in this
video is a song by Alex wax well it's a
new song it's called signs I will leave
the link in the description box so
definitely go and check it out how many
things just something a little bit
different it's not usually what you
would hear I just think should have
requires so like I said I will leave the
link in the description box so check
that out I really hope that you guys
