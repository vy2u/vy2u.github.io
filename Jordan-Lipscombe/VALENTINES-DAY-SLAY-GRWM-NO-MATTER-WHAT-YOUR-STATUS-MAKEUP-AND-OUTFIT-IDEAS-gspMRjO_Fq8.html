glam makeup look though something that

like I feel like you can still get why
not honestly I have up C no idea what
I'm gonna be doing I have a bunch of
makeup in front of me and I'm just going
to like put on my face and hope that it
looks okay so let's get started I have
of course already done my eyebrows
because to be honest with you they take
like a lifetime but if you are
interested in what I do in the little
eye here maybe here I think here I will
link a little tutorial where do my
eyebrows in there so you can see it more
in depth you can see the products I use
in everything rather than me sitting
here and pouring you you can just like
skip to that video but after this one of
course I want to see this headband makes
me look I'm about to go for a run or
something but to be honest with you
anything to keep my hair out of my face
honestly there is nothing worse than
having your makeup your makeup your
makeup in your hair that's annoying
actually but having your hair in the way
when you do your makeup like who's with
me oh yeah also I will try to use as
many kind of drug store or just easy to
get hold of products as I can I mean I
know Valentine's Day is literally like
around the corner and we don't have time
to you know go out and get a crap so no
photos or even have like the money to go
out and get them sorry news is when you
affordable and as many you need to get
products as I can honestly I swear
chopped at least like one thing in every
video by the way I usually makeup
revolution can see allow the new one to
prime my eyelids I will talk about this
a bit more when I
actually probably user okay right I said
that about using as many affordable
products as I can and the eyeshadow
palette is a high-end one but I feel
like if you need any high-end palette in
your life like if you just have to have
one
the violet Vox holy grail is for sure
that palette yeah it just has every
single minds like mind a little bit
gross to say the least but you can tell
it is well loved it is well used it has
every light matte shimmer I just I
freaking love this if you're into your
warm tones you love this you know what
before I forget I'm forgive again before

transition in hashtag for my transition

vlogs you'll know exactly what I'm
talking about well we're going back to

link around here somewhere so you can
check that out if you want to it is so
much fun last time like we're really
excited to go back they actually and

excited to do that and then the week
after that mean a little go in to Rome

the 21st of a theb which has freaking
like flown by by the way I'm going in
with wine and dine now this she is
pigmented so yeah a busy next few weeks
look at my little mirror from benefit
it's so cute it's so handy when you're
filming what did I just like turn into
Amanda by the way just like excuse
the messiness I will clean up and
everything at the end I mean I like you
look like I've been punched in the eye
right now but don't you guys sometimes
feel like there's always a stage your
makeup when you're doing and you decide
I don't know what it is it's always like
an ugly part to some makeup looks I
actually look pink Panda I'm gonna take
teddy bear now just kind of out right in
the crease do you know what while I'm
actually just like blending colors into
my eyeball
just like update you guys because you
ask me a lot about like if I'm ever
doing meetups or if there's anywhere
that you guys can meet me which is so
freaking cute I'm like why should you
want to meet me like I'm just I'm just
freaking Jordan but you do mount my
little heart like you guys are like
amazing I'm gonna be at the big beauty a
day out on the I think it's the 5th of
April the 4th the 5th common bar but on
my Instagram there's like a little photo
in there loser details as well but no I
am just so excited there's gonna be
loads of fun stuff to do that's gonna be
nice about youtubers there yeah I'm
really excited I already see comments
just like squeeze you all I actually
keep getting asked a lot of questions
from you guys and I wish I knew more but
all I know is that I have to be there at
this time and I can potentially meet you
guys and meetups and stuff like official
me apps I don't know if I'm doing one
I'm not 100 not sure yet but of course
if you just stick to my socials I'll
update all the info on there I really
fancy doing like a half cut crease and
maybe put some glitter on stuff let's do
it picking my makeup revolution
concealer and an itty-bitty baby little
brush
right guys I'm gonna go he like silent
for two SEC's you guys know about the
concentration
I swear when you do a cut crease you
actually like kind of stop living by the
way this little brush I love for cut
creases it's won by the body shop it's
just a cool little flat kind of shader
brush is perfect for cut creases no I
mean it's not the worst thing I've ever
seen it's not nikkietutorials or
anything but I'm actually gonna use
cranberry splash here as a base before I
put on the glitter this shade though
this eye shadow color was done from the
heavens it was sent from Jesus
I'm dead dumb but see that round Gator
that color is so freakin pretty I just
went off camera and just thought like
playing around instead of putting the
glitter on the first before you know
what let's try and not add glitter let's
see if I can just make this look kind of
more foiled so I took this elf molten
liquid eye shadow in rose gold just like
put a little bit on the back of my hand
like this dip the brush in put it over
the top of that color and it's given me
this amazing like foiled finish I think
I want to keep it like this now sorry
little going out you're really pretty
but today I'm gonna stick to this holy
 see though that is like go China
I'm gonna add some more teddy bear
though on this like whole corner here
just like deepen it and blend the two
colors together Oh fall out central okay
where I'm gonna go I've come a really
quick finish just eyeball and then I'll
be back to put on lashes of course we're
gonna put on some mascara before the
lashes I really really want to use this
one on camera because I've had loads of
you message me asking what this is like
a no use in a video like is it good is
the brand-new benefit bad girl bang
mascara I went to the benefit like
launch party for this and did you know
little fun fact they've been working on
is Guara for four years
oh yes it's got like space technology in
its make it really a like a light
formula there's like 300 plus bristles
on the brush I mean here is what the
brush looks like so you can kind of oh
okay an idea it is a really really nice
brush I've used this mascara and I have
to say this is probably my favorite
benefit mascara like I love roller lash
but I think I love this one a little bit
more don't know what it is about this
mascara but it like lengthens adds
volume just makes my eyelashes look like
BAM it's super jet black as well like
the pigmentation this mascara is insane
in the membrane
but if it's smashed it with this they
really really did I was like I'm a Kalai
when it it launched I was like if they
spent four years on a mascara like this
mascara better be the best fricking
mascara I have ever used in my goddamn
life to be fair I don't really feel like
I've done any justice I feel like I
could have applied it way better and a
lot like spent a lot longer on my lashes
but because I'm applying falsies in a
second I
don't I I don't really care that much
okay so four lashes oh these are so
pretty
these are by a brand called doll lash I
actually picked these up in Topshop I
didn't even know
Topshop sold these but they do in the
style to do a love lace these are really
really affordable as well these are 10
pounds oh my god I was so excited I
actually dropped them on the floor
Wow can we all just like take a moment
to appreciate these eyelashes take a
look how wispy and amazingly zombie are
Baney to just go get some schizos to cut
my owners a bit of joy lash glue of
course I don't think I use any other
logical you like ever I feel like I've
gone on such a classic route with the
ice a day but to be honest with you I
feel like these kind of colors that got
on good corduroy look good on everybody
like every skin tone
I love these eyelashes man I feel like
they look a lot thicker because I've
pulled on the mascara but they are
really pretty right uh I spent I just
shat my pants I thought I was like a
spider it's legit a bit of eyelash in my
hair time to put some face makeup on
this is actually like my favorite part
to be honest a little bit of moisturizer
honestly moisturizer to me is like the
key of a skin care before makeup this
one that I'm using is the origins
ginseng one it smells incredible it
smells like fresh oranges that honestly
putting this on every time before I do
makeup is like I'm gonna really quickly
whack on a prime I switch on my prime is
all the time to be honest this one is
the island and retexturizing a face
primer I know this isn't the easiest to
get hold of but honestly like primers
primer don't worry about it too much
it's also strange though it feels like
it's gonna be really silicone and as
soon as you stop running out on your
skin it kind of tells so like oil
nothing like a bad way but it's
interesting right okay so foundation
this one oh my god this is the
collection lost and perfection of
ultimate wear foundation I swear you can
pick this up for like four or five
pounds from superdrug they recently come
out with a bunch of new shades as well
which is fab but I feel like I made a
rookie error with this shade I got 9
shade 9 which this this is duh I got it
cuz in store it looked like a healthy
perfect undertone it's just so so dark
it kind of like oxidized and I didn't
realize I feel like I should have got a
shade 7 looking back in it now but all
that I do is I just mix like some white
mixer drops into it just a line it ever
so slightly and yeah I'm using the back
of my makeup forever bronzer to makes my
foundation my sponge just got a little
bit dry let me just spray it with my
Primark primer water I don't know I feel
like the undertone of this foundation is
kind of gray I just I don't know feel
like it's grayer than I'm used to it's
not ashy or anything it just is not the
kind of tone I usually go for that's the
only thing but the actual foundation
itself is really
Oh gotta move that out of the way oh my
forehead looks huge
ah I mean I just I just covered it in
makeup I feel like some of you are gonna
be Loki dying at the fact I've got
makeup on this white headband it's fine
um I use it for makeup anyway doesn't
this foundation though have really
really good coverage and it's kind of
like a really nice sighing finish as
well I don't know it just looks really
really nice on the skin I've been loving
it hmm moon face for concealer like I
said I'm gonna use my I suppose we make
up forever its makeup revolution conceal
and define I'm gonna open this new one
because my old one is just like see
better days oh there is nothing more
satisfying than using the brand-new
concealer who needs a man right when
you've just got a new makeup I'm kidding
I love my elves this is shade c-64 the
way okay so my force on this concealer
obviously everyone saying that it
basically is a dupe for its heart shape
tape now I have taught shape tape
concealer and I love that concealer like
everybody in their mothers however I
actually think the formula of this
concealer and touch tape tape is
actually Oh God have got an edge uh-oh I
feel like thar shape tape is a lot
thicker however if we're talking about
finish and like coverage and everything
it is very similar I mean like for four
pounds this is in those four pounds
honestly you can't go wrong and I
probably would buy this over top shape
tape so like it's not a Jew but it kinda
is a Jew I don't know about
I like this concealer either way right
before I powder anything I'm just gonna
take my iconic London illuminate drops
in original I've been loving doing this
recently I just feel like it makes my
highlight look more kind of glowy where
this is just so like wet looking I don't
know I just feel like my highlighter
looks a bit better with this underneath
like it kind of like melts into this
more rather than just looking like a
powder if that makes sense
doubts that in real quick oh hello
already I love these so much for powder
I'm gonna use the Primark this is a PS
instakill banana powder I think using
this loads recently and I actually
really like it I just feel like it does
a really really good job at setting my
makeup in place and for a banana powder
it's really not that like the non arre
like it's not that yellow which I really
really like and I don't know I've been
enjoying it it's four pounds as well
like absolute bugs I'm missing out the
iconic drops of course so that you know
we don't go over that oh my god I just
poured out loads
that's legit enough to power about 20
faces bronzer I'm really sorry guys I'm
gonna be using my makeup for everyone I
know this isn't the cheapest or the
easiest but it honestly is pretty my
all-time favorite bronzer but a brand
called be bold just a really really nice
one as well this Maybelline fit me
powder works really really nicely as a
bronzer or the body shop to a really
nice one there's loads out there I just
have to use this one you know and you
lost something so much and you can only
like rely on one thing like this is that
all NYX also do a really nice bronzer as
well just like give you a few options
whoa I've really made this headband a
you know I was gonna take off but to be
honest with you this is just the reality
of the situation
I'm just bronzing up like my cheek area
onto my temples and my forehead
basically my entire face I literally
love bronzer though like it just brings
your face back to life
I definitely feel like this look needs
some blush you know just add that like a
little bit of color so I'm gonna take
the NYX sweet cheeks blush palette oh my
god if I can open it this shade here I
have been loving it's just like a really
nice peachy orange shade it goes with
like any makeup look I feel like it's
kind of like a safe blush when I wear
blush I don't like anything too pink or
too kind of crazy so this one's more
kind of like neutral and just like
that's a little bit of color I can I put
on my apples and then like bring it back
up like this just to blend it in with
the bronzer I'm just gonna carve out
underneath here with some of that
Primark powder again just because I'm
too lazy to console to be honest so this
is kind of like reverse doing it it will
kind of make me look like I got off when
I happen I've got like a powder beard
so I mean you guys know I'm always
excited for highlight areas one of my
favorite makeup steps but the reason why
I'm really excited for this is because I
watched Hanna Renee's video and she said
that this highlighter is
pretty much a dupe for they make up
forever Highline that is literally one
of my all-time favorite highlighters but
it's a fraction of the price so now I
haven't actually used this and I know
what I open it right before I went to
film this video I wanted to like give it
a little swatch and like swatch an extra
makeup forever so I can tell you whether
I think it's close I know when I went to
open it my fun slips into it and yeah
that happened I was really sad look at
it poor little thing this is the Loreal
crushed foiled metallic highlighter I
mean in the pan it looks kind of like
we're so I swatch this one next to the
makeup for everyone and the makeup
everyone seems to have a little bit more
kind of gold to it this has a bit more
kind of that champagne e pink but let's
find out if it looks the same on the
skin that looks stunning stunning this
is legit drugstore like I'm not even
joking I've been waiting for the day
that the drugstore brings out a
highlighter that's not glittery that's
not chunky you know just that looks wet
on the skin and comes along real
honestly I'm shocked
girls and boys if you want to be glowing
on Valentine's Day oh it kind of looks
like a contoured when we really didn't
just going to finish off the eyes
quickly I'm just taking wine and dine
from that violet phosphate underneath
and then I'll probably deepen it a bit
where do teddy bear my mind literally
went blank then I had to like check the
name I'm just taking some of that laurio
highlighter in the inner corner just to
kind of you know make it pop for lips I
wasn't gonna do this I was gonna do
something a bit more berry but you know
why I'm she can go straight up nude I
feel like nude will go with whatever
outfit you guys want to put on whatever
you know I look you're wearing it like
it will just go with everything it's the
most simplest it's also the color you
don't need to worry about like if you're
on a date or something like you know
have to worry really about the lipstick
on any TV situation as much because you
know you've got a nude it's not as
obvious so I'm just gonna check on one
of my favourite Maybelline lip nude
combos so the first thing I'm putting on
is the Maybelline
that's just lipstick this is in 913 nude
in brace it's a really really nice nudey
like brown shade really quickly just to
define my lips even more I'm taking the
NYX suede matte lip liner in downtown
Beauty just to define them a little bit
more cuz we are going like so nude and
then over the top I'm taking the
Maybelline vivid hot lacquer in that's
he is one of my favorite nude gloss is
just to finish off the entire look then
lastly I'm just gonna take my Ofra Tsang
spray anyhow everything I think that is
they look complete right okay so I just
took off that gross US hair band and I
also went ahead and just gave you guys a
few options for Valentine's Day we went
from like glam like date night we're
going allow all the way to just like
chillin at home in your comfy stuff okay
so I thought I would share with you guys
a few potential outfits that you could
wear on Valentine's Day I'm gonna do it
for like all different occasions so we
are starting off with a more like
dressier like going all out kind of oh
is this white lace jumpsuit from in the
style as you can see it is a jumpsuit it
goes all the way down to the floor it
kind of just like flares out if you can
see that and it has this amazing lace
pattern all over it this is actually
popular Sarah Asheville collection this
is one of my favorite pieces that she
does in the entire collection I chose to
go for the white one but she does have
it in black and red
that's what I think it's just nice and
low cut you have you know bits to cover
units as you can see like your cheeks
are like pretty much covered that's not
out or anything I just love all the lace
I think it is so pretty you could even
if you want to just pop out around the
middle to like bring you in even more
here but it's pretty like figure-hugging
as it is just so you guys know this is a
size 6 I am normally a size 8 by size
down and it fits literally like
perfectly so yeah here is one option if
you decide to go more down the glamour
ooh onto
hey this outfit here definitely is one
of like my all-time favorite looks
black satin shirt dress hopefully you
guys can see that it is satin it's just
so cash but it does just look like
you've made a 13 on I mean plus even
more of a bonus it's so comfortable like
just feel like I'm showing in a shirt
but I literally am this show particulate
from pretty long thing is partly
Kourtney Kardashian Kollection you like
have to wear a belt with it I just put
this one from Primark Lilla Gucci doop
here yeah you have to pay a belt with it
because it's literally huge like you
need the belt for shape I just sort of
like tuck all the material underneath
the belt and kind of just like pull out
in the shape of how I like and this is
pretty much what you end up with I've
just paired it with some playing at
black heels as well but you could go
more down like the boot Roux or
something like that just to kind of
catch up even more these hills by the
way off from my sort of place yes this
look here is I could go to look for me
it's a safe option like if I don't
really know what to wear I throw this on
I know I'm going to be comfy I know I'm
gonna still look alright it works you
know I love this one
oh and I think this is enough size six
as well I don't feel like this would be
a Valentine's Day little situation if I
didn't include something red so I had
this in my wardrobe now I was like you
know what let's do it this is a really
really cute little red to piece from
pretty fake it's just this little red
like crop top and by the way I'm not
even wearing a bra with this this is a
size eight this whole thing look she
look like I have loops and then the
trousers are like flared
oh my god my leg looks so long but you
see you guys know I have to wear the
biggest and chunky boots with this
outfit because these trousers are so
long if you're like anything under one 5
foot 5 and they're all on me so if
you're under that just bear in mind that
they're probably gonna be really long I
mean when I put like the big chunky
boots on they're fine like they fit fine
but just they you know I feel like this
outfit it's like the perfect in-between
outfit it's like dressy but you could
totally dress it down because really
it's just like trousers and a table it's
totally up to you whatever vibe you're
going for another one I love this next
one is way more like a dinosaur like
cash like vibe but like you still put in
an effort kind of things by the way I'm
holding my arm here because I can't find
my nipple covers for the life of me and
if I don't do this then like nip is
gonna be on full display
and you don't want to see that basically
I've just gone for like a skirt lace
bodysuit kind of a vibe with like a
jacket thrown over the top
there's no fair cropped hoodie which is
like so smoke is from pretty little
thing the bodysuit as well as some
pretty little things over the back if
you can see that I'm trying to show you
the bodysuit without like flashing you
but it's really cute it's just like
black lace and the skirt is from nasty
go and then I just Pat it with these I
start first sock boots to kind of really
make it casual it's all in a size 8 it
small by the way I think I have one more
to show you now and this is probably
like one of my absolute favorites you'll
see what I have for everybody on
Valentine's Day who's just chilling at
home this one's for you I didn't forget
about you
guys we're in a little comfy Court this
is so comfy I live in this all the time
this little like Co auditing look I even
have fuzzy socks on this look how odd is
from maniÃ¨re d'avoir which is actually
won my favor like online shops I left
that place there are some like really
cool stuff like they make comfy stuff
look cool guys I don't even have a bra
on that's when you know it's got comfy
like it's Coryell so yeah this is one of
their like pieces this is why I'm in 99%
of time with the socks oh no I really
