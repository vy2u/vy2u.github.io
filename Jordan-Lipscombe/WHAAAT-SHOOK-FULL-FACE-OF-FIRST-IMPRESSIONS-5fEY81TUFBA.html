this children back at it again with
another YouTube video I feel like it has
been a hot minute since I've sat down
and just played around with makeup I
know that the last time I filmed a light
makeup video was Valentine's Day oh
that's like nearly a month ago I feel
like I don't do as much makeup as I used
to just because I'm trying to like
include different things on my channel
rather than just makeup makeup makeup I
mean I love makeup but I'm not like a
makeup girl do you know what I mean I
can't sit here and like create some like
insane makeup look there's some amazing
makeup artists or a makeup gals and boys
on the tube and I just I'm not nearly
I'm just a 19 year old girl I'm actually
need 20 I'm nearly not a teenager how's
this happened
why am i growing up police can I say
teenage for the rest of my life so I
don't have to adult in any way shape or
form thank you but no I am genuinely
just a 19 year old girl who enjoys
makeup and enjoys putting it on half
face so let's play around with makeup
and because I've got like a bunch of new
makeup to try out I thought I would do a
first impression so you know me and you
we can get like a feel what's good
what's not some of this makeup will be
kind of newer stuff some of it you
probably have seen on before but I'm
just gonna give you my opinion on it
it's only one who cares out there anyway
let's jump it even my phone's getting
excited sorry what brows are already on
your mobile itself I literally don't
have anything new to try in that little
department so I literally just did my
normal routine I will leave a link in
the description box below to where I did
my brows a little bit more in-depth if
you are interested at all but for now
I'm gonna go ahead prime my bull of eyes
and then once a son I'll be back and we
can test all the juicy stuff and get the
juices flowing oh really your own juices
flowing right my eyes are primed I mean
I've never looked better
it actually look like a little like
alien look a little bald alien like my
eyes look bald you know I mean like were
my eyelashes oh my god though I'm so
excited I just used a new sponge little
sneak peek and holy shit C's I think we
have a blender like little Jupiler hands
that's all I'm saying for eyeshadows
today I was actually gonna use this
little guy this is the abdicate naked
petite heap a layer I mean first of all
Hoth
thank you is this they basically made a
mini version of the naked heat palette
and to put all the essential shades in
there but I already love the original
naked so I just know I'm gonna love this
so I feel like using something I don't
know about you know I mean it's a first
impression so after all so I thought
let's go down the little drugstore roof
and I have this palette from a models
own this is their barely there too I
shadow a palette the colors inside this
palette is right up my street everything
it's really warm rear o-z super super
wearable and I feel like you guys will
love this if it's good of course I feel
like some colors are more pigmented than
others yeah but of course we can swatch
an eyeshadow boat only you know it's
about how it's on the eyeball you know
I'm gonna use my NYX I think a 16 brush
it's kind of like rubbed off because I
use it so much NYX brushes by they're
some of the best brushes I've ever ever
you Disney Channel I'm gonna start with
this color here hmm it's got a really
really nice like a pigment to it that
shade it seems to be blending okay look
at me using all the profesh words
pigmented blending well blend into that
you know that tentacle is that it's
clinging a little beyond this outer
corner here but I feel like the actual
light formula of them is a little bit
more drier so you could have to like you
know get that arm workout I'm just gonna
build that up a little bit more just to
get their color even more they're you
know by the way ignore this outer corner
mess here I'm gonna clean up at the end
repeat that on this eye jeez Louise my
arm is already like see is this see ya
no real talk though I'm really happy
about so far that color was fab to work
with okay now I'm gonna go in with a
Nick 17 brush this one's like a little
bit more like tapered and fluffy so I
can get like right in that crease I'm
gonna take this nice warm orange e this
is her name I'm gonna does the first
color I took was called a slip
I think it's called slip and this one's
called undone I'm gonna put that color
right in the crease
is they even doing anything
I mean it kind of doesn't really look
like it's doing much but I guess
compared to this is darker I'm just
gonna keep like building out I guess I'm
gonna put on the outer corner as well
I'm just kind of like buff everything
together
sheilo somehow still or something in
there it's not like wham bam thank you
ma'am you know it's like oh hi how you
doin today and I'm gonna take a sigma
e25 it's kind of like flutter and like a
little bit fluffy we're gonna go in into
the deep and we're gonna go into this
Brown this is called timid it's not very
timid and this is gonna go on that our
corner area actually I take it back is
uh it is kind of timid this is gonna be
another like color builder for sure like
you can see the color there it's
definitely like adding I don't know like
you can't instantly see the change you
can only see when it starts building
like I'm really going in like I'm really
trying to pick up the color and pack it
on oh that was a bit better actually
okay like wiggle your brush in I kind of
have a feeling that that is about as
good as I'm gonna get so be honest so
leave it there
the colors are gorgeous wish they were
more pigmented um but I probably will
like reach for again I'm not gonna be
like no yeah it was it was okay okay so
I have this pigment from peaches and
cream which I have literally like been
eyeing up it looks very very pretty
though I think I'm gonna go ahead and do
is carve out the crease like a half cut
crease and then apply this pigment down
we'll see how it goes
this is a Sigma concealer brush by the
way that I'm gonna use to cover the
crease whoa he goes my attempt oh my god
actually I have been seeing I saw on
Nicole Guerrero's video she puts like a
lobe of concealer here looks up and then
I like prints and then you can follow
like the cut crease sure I mean let's
see if it works and see if it makes my
like life so much easier she puts it
here and then she looks up oh my god it
actually has given me a line to work
with
well that was like the easiest cut
crease I think I've ever done
blend that corner of my finger a little
bit I'm gonna say psychics that actually
worked
absolute genius honestly Paul D amazing
no fur although that was honestly the
easiest cut crease I have ever done in
my life that in place here is the
pigment that I've been dying to use this
is my peaches and cream and this is in
the color Phoenix it is this in same
burgundy red oh my god it just looks
amazing Oh what are you getting that
color though I'm actually gonna apply
some of the glitter primer from NYX you
tell you don't have to do this because
like Hello but I just want the pigment
to stick a little bit better because
there is a bit of fall out
oh my god is it me or is that like 10
times more intense I literally have no
words
that's like next-level man I last Shani
guy to the knee I love that color like
this already pinky vibe ah I kind of add
a little bit more orange enos into it I
have used this before and cheating a
little bit I guess this is the NYX face
and body clay in copper this is one of
my all-time like all-time favorite
glares the color the glitter just
everything about it so the teeny bit of
glitter glue on my brush I'm just gonna
take some of that NYX glitter and just
Pat it over the top
just when I thought it couldn't get
better yeah I am obsessed I'm hoping the
camera is like picking up how actually
like shiny and Glary this is get rid of
all the fallout clean up the edge okay a
fab so I'm gonna go ahead and do now is
just quickly go off camera do the
exactly the same on this eye hello just
fail hi shadow well for the like top
half of my eyes is done I was debating
about putting a wing in but Mike I don't
know I don't know I just feel like this
is a little bit simpler now you know
what I'm gonna move straight on to
mascara and of course lashes we all know
about the benefit back out bang mascara
you probably may have been expecting me
to use that mascara because it's one of
like the New Orleans I have used it on
my channel before so it's not gonna be
like a first impressions but I have this
mascara my collection and it's pretty
new and I've never used it this is the
Maybelline total temptation mascara
there's nothing more to it why did I
just smell that like it's a mascara
Jordan what did you expect
let's go in whoa okay this is definitely
like a volumizing mascara you know when
you put on your lashes and they're like
black you know what I would definitely
say this is more of a like volumizing
mascara then it is lengthening so if
you're a girl or boy that loves you know
thick eyelashes then this is probably
the mascara for you the brush sorry it's
kind of one of those brushes are like
it's like half plastic half like fuzzy
stuff like look at the wand do you see
what I mean like it's a bit all over the
place a little bit crazy
that's legit eye description of me all
over the place and a little bit crazy
right warning you're all probably about
to hate me I will see you some lashes
that are not in its original box and I
have absolutely no idea what they are
but I will have like a hunt through and
find the name and I'll leave in the
description box below I know I'm a pain
in the ass you were lash glue oh
actually I think I know what these are I
think that by a brand called lashes by
Lucy proudiy Jordan Prouty
me remembering that jeez that was like a
miracle yeah as I was saying I don't
really have any new lashes to try so
we're just like stick on
and yelled once God's plan God's plan
dananananana I've literally got God's
plan stuck in my head and it's like it's
the coming a problem she said do you
love me I'd say hello only partly I only
love my bed and my mom I'm sorry
oh my phone right are we stuck are we
stuck
yes we are
well that one like literally basically
fell on my eyeball that's like the best
thing about a used eyelash they already
like have molded to your eye shape so
it's like easy peasy lemon squeezy
well these lashes are gorge I love them
now I need to find the name of them we
are now on to base makeup which is like
my favorite part of makeup eye makeup
I'm like Mia but then skin products I
get like a big side for for my primer
today I have this little guy here these
are the next total control what drop lil
primer give it a little shake over the
noise doesn't say much about what its
gonna do body is a really liquidy primus
regime it's just gonna like create a
nice base am i an Instagram gal yeah I
feel like oh okay
it's dripping quickly saved it I'm just
using this Sigma small dry fiber brush
to balloon lion I've been really liking
using a brush recently my Primark which
is strange because no nearly is what my
mama gave me but you know switching it
up I feel like this I did like a really
soft glow do you not I mean do you know
I mean generally oh wow my skin
that is smooth feels really hydrating
really really moisturizing it doesn't
feel like heavy on my skin or anything
I like that obviously I don't know how
well it's gonna be up making my makeup
loss but the feel of it
turnout then I had two foundations that
I could test out one was by a brand
called voila their serum foundation this
is a high information and then had the
next her control drops I asked you guys
which one you wanted to you see and of
course all my little drugstore boys and
gals out there wanted to the fall guy
which I'm all here for like Jamie Rahn I
love myself a good high end product but
like I'm a drugstore girl at heart and I
matches the primer so I'm like okay now
of course this isn't new this has been
around for a little while now but I mean
I've mixed this foundation in with other
foundations but I've not used it by
itself so today is that day we're gonna
test it out that is so liquidy oh my god
I'm using number thirteen golden so it
isn't a little dropper and I've just
read up that the dropper is meant to
help with customizing your coverage so
it can be shared to full coverage and
it's a soft matte finish okay let's see
if that's true let's see if we can get
our full coverage because you know
without looking like men and made a
Victoria sponge cake for me you know I'm
just gonna like to drop it on my skin
like this oh crap I've not where might
be blender sugar I'll just like blue
night BRB gonna go but then I'm excited
I this photo right okay I'm back with a
little sponge this with a sponge I spoke
about earlier
GameChanger no joke this is softer there
might be a blender I don't understand
it's so squeaky this sponges by brand
called sport FX is their blend and go
and make up blending a sponge it is
$4.99 this is five pounds like I'm sorry
but Peter bender waters like I need to
finish him some foundation on Kusum
yeah that's better oh really quickly the
sponge as well it has like a rounded
bottom like a normal B blender and then
all the edges are kind of like they got
like edge it right okay let me sell it
again it's like a little hexagon all the
edges are like cut off it's not like
round and the tops like a little
hexagonal thing as well anyway back to
the face okay so that amount I've put on
my face is definitely giving me more
like a light coverage I can still see
everything
peeking a3 which isn't a bad thing
obviously this means this could be a
really good light every day a foundation
well we'll see I'm gonna add a little
bit more because you know how I am about
coverage and we can see if it is
actually buildable the noise yes see
know that that is what I'm talking about
it doesn't even look like I've added
anything extra to my skin like at all
the finish as well I love it said it's
like soft matte but sabonis with you I
think it's not like a satin I can
definitely see like mother close to my
skin the color is pretty good I'm just
gonna blend it on my neck so we don't
have a line do we double chin check
don't you forget it
skirt around the eyebrows if there is
people out there who you know want a
light coverage then whack this on like a
little bit of it on Bob's your uncle
funnies your arm and then for my full
coverage Queens out there you can get
that with this foundation as well I am
digging this I actually really wanted to
try this foundation because Sam who is
one of the UK and NYX a girls she always
has the most amazing makeup like her eye
makeup her skin makeup everything she
always looks flawless like she's
stunning and her skin looked in a crowd
and I was like girl what is on your skin
and it was these drops and I was like oh
my god okay well I'm missing out it has
covered everything on my skin I had some
like scarring around here you can
probably see like the texture but color
wise it's gone now that I'm looking
really close up Wow okay I'm gonna be
sure it looks beautiful like hopefully
you guys can see it doesn't look like
it's sitting on my skin my skin just
looks like skin and you know what okay
next okay this is the reason why NYX is
my favorite drugstore brand because
shit's fire love it love it love it now
the only real test is how this is gonna
like hold up on my oily skin if you're
new around here hi I'm Jordan thank you
so much for being here in the t-zone my
skin is an oily mess so let's see how
well this holds up
time for some concealer to sort this
situation out right here this is the
concealer that I'm gonna be trying out I
have a few colors here this is the
model's own cover at full coverage
concealer full coverage concealer the
ultimate ink Alpes full coverage
concealer will airbrush any
imperfections to leave you with flawless
skin easy to apply and blend while the
high-performance formula actually covers
skin imperfections with all-day wear I'm
gonna go for this shake here this is
medium term which is 0-3 I'm just gonna
oh I'm gonna squeeze some underneath my
eye it's not too much maybe I wish this
was like a little dope
I don't like this applicator I mean
technically it's not out like a Tara
it's just a tube but you know what I
mean like I wish I didn't have to like
squeeze this out use a brush I just
wanna like whack my concealer on she
thick she thick oh I'm not gonna lie it
feels kind of like a little bit sticky
it's strange because it's like blending
out really nicely but it feels a little
bit like can you hear this sound this is
like the way that this sounds is the way
that it feels it kinda is tugging ever
so slightly this is how easy it is to
blend out like done pretty much it's
covering really really nicely as well as
got good coverage
he's quite like Joey do you know what I
mean like my under eyes are glowing even
though it's I've ever thicker and
stickier kind of formula doesn't look
heavy on my skin like it's not you know
I did any you know extra like gross Ness
in the middle here it's seeing on my
skin it really really nicely it blended
nicely it looks nice yeah this is nice
this is nice before I go ahead and set
this all in place I actually have some
cream contour to test out it is another
next product next bringing other goods
so we all know about their NYX powder
highlight and contour palette right like
I feel like everyone and their mothers
all loved this but they've now come out
with a cream version on it so for
everyone out there who loves a little
bit cream contour this could essentially
be you all by the way I know it probably
looks like either used it but that's
just me likes watching it cuz when I get
new things I get really excited and I'm
like testing them out on everyone me my
mom my mom is literally
my little tests are like if I get any
makeup or if she's like put it on me put
it on me really nice array of shades
like there's a really nice dark one here
thing you know my darker skin girls and
boys it's nice I think I'm gonna go in
with this one cakes I usually like a bit
more like a Walmart contour for my face
otherwise I felt like I look like bruise
like someone just come along like punch
me in the face really really creamy he's
asked for sure definitely yeah but cool
that's one used to but let's see how it
blends out it's just like gliding on my
skin like whoa take the sponge that was
so easy it literally just like melts
into the skin definitely a little bit
too cool for my personal liking - that
and you know we're just looking at the
actual formula itself blending out
really really nicely doesn't look patchy
muddy or anything and that's obviously
the most important thing and it has
definitely given me like what it's meant
to do a little bit of shape I don't like
as Moony as I did before
moon emoji it's really really soft and
subtle as well super easy to use so like
beginners and staff easy-peasy this is a
little bit too cool for me I like more
of a warmer Khan so I just think it
seeks my complexion a little bit better
nothing against the formula there fab
it's just color wise I probably won't be
picking this up as much as I thought I
would but if you are someone who likes
you know a nice cool cream contour then
you're gonna love this for sure next
let's set this face in place this is the
only powder in my collection that I've
never tried this is the vici dermablend
same powder says it has a matte and
natural Lazar when it comes with one of
these little guys which see is this vici
is actually more of a skincare brand so
I'm interested to see what their makeup
site whoa that is like white straight-up
Casper the ghost right get rid of these
creases this concealer definitely
creases pack some of this on whoa it's
really really nice and finely milled
that's just like melt it into the skin
is one of those powders that you like
you go to pack on so I bake with but it
just like melts into the skin
whoa look how soft my skin looks here
you know I've just realized
please don't flash back it's really
really finely milled and it's a bright
white powder
these are nori the powders that get you
when it comes to flash photography I'm
brave I'm going like in and saying my
entire face with this let's hope that I
don't look like the color of my top at
the
this I just have to set my entire phase
because otherwise I feel like my bronzer
and stuff doesn't blend as well and
because obviously my skin type as well
right
oh I'll make my nose itch okay let's do
a flash photography test
there's no flashback I mean my face is
like a lil bit off to the rest of my
body but that's just because I have
obviously no color on my face
vichu yeah this is what I'm talking
about this is what we need I'm really
intrigued now to see how well it will
hold up and like you know preventing the
oils coming through we'll find out
here's the bronzer I'm gonna be trying
out so Too Faced have come out with this
whole like unicorn festively collection
which I'm not normally a huge fan of I
feel like the whole like rainbow esque
trend should have been left in 2017
they have throw a unicorn tears
iridescent mystical bronzer there is
genuinely a unicorn printed into this
packaging and the unicorn itself is like
a purpley pink iridescent color I'm not
gonna lie it's cute it's cute but I'm
hoping that doesn't not make my face
this color unlike all of two-faced
bronzers literally smell like chocolate
and I love it
Jackie like tastes like chocolate okay
to apply it I'm going to use my favorite
bronzer brush this is the morphe 4 I'm
actually a little bit scared to like go
in this I'm gonna tap in the bronzer and
then like a little bit in the beautiful
oh that's a really pretty color it's
definitely more like a rich deep tan
color color you know that more on the
ready side can you see the glow that
it's giving my skin do you know what
that I feel like if you went like this
and then went all-in I feel like it'd be
way too much like you look like this
your face would literally be this color
if you kind of just like dabbing it I
actually just hit that didn't I I just
out feel free to unsubscribe totally to
get it I'm gross but now I feel like if
you just like gently you know in the
Unicorn you'll be fine I actually can't
believe there's a freaking unicorn
printed in this bronzer I feel a little
bit crazy when I'm saying if you're just
like dabbing the unicorn like yeah you
can definitely see the shine on this
cheek I mean I like it I don't love it
for blush I'm gonna take one of the
makeup forever little power is this or
palette you can actually like customize
yourself I think I'm gonna try out this
one on the end it is called Oh Doug my
nay leans away yeah no I will get it out
I'm detect this is the artist face color
so she is competent powder not a blush
but I would not use that to contour does
actually say the color I just said s3
1-0 I'm gonna take on my Sigma F 15 it's
one of that you were fiber brushes this
is on my favorite brush to apply blush
brush to apply blush that's like a
little tongue twister oh that's really
pretty this is more of that like flush
of color blush you know what I mean I
really really like that color is super
bearable and like when it comes to the
blush that's kind of what you want real
quick I'm gonna use that same VG powder
just to carve out under here she said
the cheekbones are pop in this sponge
you can literally use one of the like
edges and just go in yeah done done
everybody's favorite part the glow the
highlight are this really interesting
products here and I feel like I just
have to try it you know one of those
things that you like what so this is by
a brand called incredible and it's the
you go girl
iridescent jelly highlighter and this
one's in the color Shogo it's like a
pinky gold and yeah when I say jelly
this is legit like jelly it is the
weirdest thing ever
is so strange it's like squishy but then
like wet at the same time I don't know
if you can see but it's like glitter I
think this is like pure glare that comes
out
oh my god you know what it feels like
JimBob like as a kid used to have them
little aliens in that jelly you know
they're really squishy aliens they'd
like fry each other and fry what wasn't
it like stick and you remember people
used to say if you rub their backs
together they'd make babies never did
that's this this feels like what they
lived in honestly I'm not gonna lie I'm
a little bit scared to use this it's
really cool but it's also really Glary
okay I'm gonna take a look on my finger
and I'm just gonna gently tap it on
we'll just roll with it
oh my god deep breaths deep breath deep
breaths this is that step that could
just ruin it all
oh okay um Wow definitely is glittery
that's for sure that's pretty intense
though it's kind of cool everyday basis
probably not but this would be hella
cool for like festivals and stuff it
drives down really quickly as well I
mean you can kind of see it is just more
like glitter you know rather then glow
but I mean it's cool and I'm gonna have
to put it on this side of my face as
well now so I match I do want more of a
glow rather than just like glitter huh
so this is the new Urban Decay X Kristen
LeeAnn like highlight palette inside
there is free really really pretty
highlight colors are they're also super
wearable and more kind of like champagne
gold which is awesome I'm gonna mix
these two together yeah dad is so much
better huh that's pretty intense I mean
I did pack quite a bit on my brush she's
just like melting into the skin like
stabbed into a pin Kristen an urban
decay if you're watching this which
definitely not hot but you did a really
really fab job they're really really
pretty he'll pee a little bit on the tip
of my nose also I've been putting it
like him to be my brows here at the
moment as well like nose brow bridge
area here and then just a little bit
above my eyebrows safe to say I'm goin
let's just just this oh just to finish
up the eyes I'm gonna go back in with
the same colors that I used on my eyes
from the models own palette just
underneath to kind of like smoke
everything out why do I feel like these
colors are way more pigmented underneath
my eye that it was on top fused
I'm also just taking this color here and
putting in the inner corner and that is
bright very last thing to do now is
ellipse I don't you know what kind of
lip color to go for I feel like I always
do nude so I might go for like
a brown maybe I have a bunch of the
barium map me up lip kits here so yeah
matte liquid lipstick and a matte lip
liner inside kylie jenner coming for ya
Jan what I might brave it
let's go Brown let's do it this color is
called the day so sheet let's start with
a lip liner oh hello pigment it's a
little bit hard I feel like a meter
there we go you know I like a lip line
it's brand new and you feel like you're
like cutting your lip but yeah so much
better now though oh I'm actually 1s to
be honest now for the liquid lipstick oh
look at that
that color is literally the eautiful
it's like the perfect ready Brown these
are like gliding on the form is really
thin and kind of liquidy and just is
like bam bam
this is stun this color is stun I can't
feel this on my lips like the flow of
these is amazing I really really like
these lip kits like I can't even feel
this on my lips like at all I feel like
I want to go over up a lil bit gloss
though so I'm gonna go in with this
little guy which looks insane this is by
Primark this is the insta gold diamonds
lip topper it literally looks like gold
let's give it a go look how glossy my
lip is now holy crap
it is kind of thick though like I don't
know if you guys will be able to see but
a little bit sticky I kind of don't care
that much though because look how glossy
my lips are right now
like they look wet it's one of those
glasses that yeah it's sticky but like
you can't help her nose it looks ball
very last thing now we're gonna set
everything in place of course never try
this is the Too Faced festival refresh
mystical effects setting and refreshing
spray confused with opalescent as I say
at pearls for all over sparkling
illumination cools on context helps
refine pause and improve skin texture
while Rockwell Oh Mike can you speak
while rose quartz powder add some a lot
of energy to your makeup so I'm gonna
cook you a lamb imitation my god look at
this in the bottle look at it like all
swirling around can you see that my
mouth holy crap that tastes tastes
because I open my mouth now that smells
like strawberry lollies did I just ruin
my makeup
I have like purple spots from me like
powder on my face
there's like one huge one here and those
little purple spots here some of my face
here and here and here thank God you can
literally just dust it off thought we
were at the end there guys I thought
that's it game over I just got my lips
Wow
definitely not a huge fan of this it
smells amazing but okay it's so makeup
everything is on my face it's all done
there's first impressions when so well
there was a couple things in there that
was a bit like oh gosh I'm really happy
with the way my makeup looks I really
really like this skin like this
foundation is insane like you need it
the highlight was insane as well I loved
a pigment on the eyes that peach thing
cream at pigman the berry I'm little
kitten saying that lip gloss insane
overall apart from that two-faced spray
I did like everything obviously there
are things that I won't pick up as often
as others but overall this is a good
video I always think odd
- anything with first impressions
sometimes you risk it coming out like a
shitshow but that's what they're all
about so there's everything from me I
really hope you guys enjoy the video and
found it helpful if you did you know and
