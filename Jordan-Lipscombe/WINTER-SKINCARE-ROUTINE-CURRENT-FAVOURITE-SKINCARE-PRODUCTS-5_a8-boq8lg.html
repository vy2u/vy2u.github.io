on a regular basis so it is really
important to me that I remove my makeup
properly at the end of the day always
have a good skin care regime because you
know skin goes through a lot during the
day with weather changes and everything
causing it to freak out which is so
annoying so first thing I always do is
remove my makeup of course and also my
eyelashes don't forget those and then I
go in with the at least I'll have some
polish hot cloth cleanser this is one of
the best make removers I have ever used
literally my face just melt right off
every time I use this so quickly and so
easily but don't eat it is gross and
then of course I use it on my eyes as
well that's a great look and then I use
this flannel that it comes with I just
dampen it and then use that to wipe off
all of the makeup by the way the makeup
remover is really good for around the
eyes it doesn't irritate it or anything
as well and then you can see on the
cloth all the makeup light comes off
that's gross now I'm going to wash and
cleanse my skin I'm using my vanity
planets ultimate skin spot and also
there's some men's charcoal spacecrafts
and Superdrug
yes it's mint honestly this is such a
good space wash it's one of the best
I've ever use obviously the charcoal
helps get into the pores and remove
impurities and all that good stuff and
then also has little beads in this also
helps to like exfoliate the skin it
gently - it's just so good so of course
I'm going to go ahead and wash all of
that off and then Pat my face dry with a
clean towel make sure it's clean because
you know we don't expect bacteria or
anything and then we're moving on to
masks now I do this once or twice a week
some of my favorite I love the Garnier
moisture balm one this is perfect for
the winter cycles of see we have dry
skin but I went for a glam glow while I
was clearly feeling a little bit fancy
no but honestly these are so worth the
money not only do they smell incredible
like look at this one this one is the
gravity mud one this is like a metallic
peel-off mask it really helps to like
brighten and lift and plump the skin
it's a really really good one every time
you just mark I legit for like the Tin
Man I love it so I'll leave it on for
about twenty to thirty minutes and then
while that's sort of drying or you know
scroll through social media or whatever
and then I've been obsessed with this
game it's his best things now I'm sure
you've all heard of it because it is
super popular and so I wanted to try it
for myself because I love myself a good
game when I'm just like chilling out you
know so best thing to give get in
contact with me and ask
want to promote the game and of course I
said yes because I've been really really
enjoying it so basically what you do is
you choose what characters you want to
play each level there's a ton to choose
from and win and upgrade and and then
you just match together the same color
icons like this you can do as many as
you can and then it will go to your
little character and you'll start
killing just slug okay guys I am a child
at heart and going to admit it so I'm
completely in my element here
and what's really cool as well as it's
super interactive and has tons of
entertainment along the way so for
example at level 100 I think it is
there's loads of like character
questions and stuff and then you can
always get loads of exclusive prizes
like gold new staff there's always
things to do and so this is a free game
I will leave the link in the description
box so you can go download it and if you
do download it now and you get five
pounds worth of gold and diamonds for
free if you make it to level ten now I'm
actually on level 32 so in the comments
below let me know what level you guys
are on and we can all scroll through and
see who's winning and if you do want to
take the challenge even further you can
actually link out to Facebook and
compete with your friends and there's
like leaderboards and stuff so you can
get serious about this now I'm going to
be honest guys I'm addicted so warning
this is addictive you won't come off of
it but it's so much fun so and then of
course we are going to go ahead and just
peel off the mask as soon as it's dry
now does anybody else when peeling off a
face mask so satisfying was it just me
especially when you like peel it off all
in one I love that mine didn't work like
that in this video though but but this
face mask leaves my skin that feeling
just so plump and like brightens it I
don't know I just love it
now I go in with these bless that's
incredible
glycolic resurfacing personally just
come in little sachets and they're just
a pad that slopes in this product I just
go ahead and swipe that all over my skin
this helps with like everything from
darks box imperfections fine lines
wrinkles I find it really helped to
discourage some blemishes on my skin
it's so much they're like a new
discovery for me and I use them every
single day and they've made a huge
difference to my skin and then I'll just
go ahead and let that dry and head in
with a moisturizer so this is the Nippon
fab tale fix moisturizer this is amazing
if you have dry skin on a slate it's so
hydrating so like I love it in the
wintertime because you know I'm just
going to get quite dry and also it
smells like vegetables which I mean
anything that smells like vegetables has
to be doing something right and then
I'll just take that down at my neck as
well and then I go in with an eye cream
again this is from NYX and fab this is
there no needle fix I cream I just take
a really really small amount you
actually need the smallest bit and I
just Pat that on underneath my eyes and
this really helps to like tighten my
under eye area and make them look less
tired and then I finish up with the
Mario Badescu drying lotion this is
gonna see one of the best blemish
treatments I have ever used so all you
do is you take a cotton pad and you dip
it into the pink powder at the bottom
you don't mix them together and then you
just bring it out and pop on any
blemishes that you have guys if you
suffer from damages you need this this
is the best thing I have ever used this
is what heals my blemishes up so quickly
you just sleep in it and it reduces the
size of them right insane amounts it's
so good and then of course I go in with
my trusty old and Vaseline lip balm to
finish off because my lips get hella dry
in the winter head gross so I just coat
my lips with that
and then I'll just head off to bed enter
the products work their magic so that is
it for this video I hope you guys
enjoyed if you did don't forget to hit
that thumbs up bye and subscribe if you
aren't already I love you guys and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
