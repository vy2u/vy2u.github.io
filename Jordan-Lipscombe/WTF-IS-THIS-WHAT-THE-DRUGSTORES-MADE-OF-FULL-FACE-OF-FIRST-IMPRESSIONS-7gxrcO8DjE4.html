drugstore first impressions for you guys
which I'm so buzzing for I know you guys
ready appreciate when I do drugstore
makeup and I mean I'm a huge drugstore
fan like for sure so yeah everything on
my face right now is actually a
drugstore makeup bar actually the
eyebrows but I explained that in the
video and a lot of it is why I was like
brand new which is like super exciting
you should definitely keep watching that
except with some flops in this video I
did a little pole thing on today I like
I do that now cuz I'm just like such a
pro YouTube like but yeah I asked if you
wanted something more natural or whether
you basically wanted to like go full
glam see what the drugstores made off
kind of thing and you guys were like
full glam yeah I come up with this like
makeup look here like a cocky green eye
nude layup that sort of vibe so if you
don't know how I did and this and all
the products I used and my thoughts I'm
like a bunch of new products that was a
mouthful you guys all just keep watching
why do I let you do it like I'm about to
go running or something thinners
literally irrelevant let's just like -
starting with a little bit of primer but
this isn't just any old primer this is
basically a face mask primer source
situation which I love me a face Muslim
so excited to use this so this is my
brown called a bio bow and I think you
get on bu Ben it's like four pounds or
something with tea tree oil rosehip
extract and vitamin C enhances radiance
for minimizes pores and evens skin tone
hashtag primer which to be honest with
you I could do with I could do with so
it says it perhaps the skin for flawless
makeup application so I mean let's give
this a go good oh my god is so slimy
these always just look so weird oh my
god it's so cold oh my god it for so
good though already I'm like yes you
better pry my skin hands you'd better
pram my skin I didn't even read what I
meant to do by me it's a face mask right
like pretty self-explanatory five
minutes peel off and rinse then apply
makeup okay so I think of that basically
I'm just gonna like chill here for five
minutes and I'll come back to you guys
when
I'm done okay so I spent about five
minutes now I think I mean I'm kind of
like bored of waiting to be honest I'm
just gonna like peel it off I mean I'm
not gonna lie my skin just feel really
really fresh feel like I need to look
closer you know what I'm actually kind
of impressed it's left my skin with like
a really nice glow which you know I'm
all about like looking close up it just
looks so like smooth I can still see
pores like a let's people I don't think
was gonna get rid of my paws it does
look hella hella smooth and just like
healthy so the way it looks on my skin
right now I do really like it's nothing
revolutionary
I'm gonna be honest but I do really like
it and I like the idea of having a mask
because you can no just like sit back
and chill I'm now gonna move on to my
brows I've use this once before so it
kinda says the first impressions kinda
cheating just like a little bit but like
it's so fine so the brand is iconic
London and the reason why I wanted to
use this in this video is I wanted to
try a bunch a new makeup but I didn't
really see anything from the drugstore
anything that really like caught my
eyeballs so didn't know what to do and
then iconic London on concert with me
and why hey jorts like we've got new
eyebrow product do you want to try air
of course I was down because I'm always
down for trying new eyebrow products so
this is actually our eyebrow cushion and
when I heard of this I was like coming
at eyebrow kosher no way you just have
it
I'm just upon this it does come with
little brush in a spoolie and then you
this is the story of my life de puntos
you get this - what I brush inside it
has two different colors which I really
like because typically you kind of want
the end of your eyebrow to be darker in
the front to be lighter you can do that
with this so I was like Gucci and can I
just point out the first time I use this
I like proper dunks my brush in and put
on my eyebrows and azar because I had so
much product on there this is so
pigmented you let you need the smallest
amount look I'm barely pressed and look
how much product comes out like
it's the brushed icons with isn't that
it all like as you can see you can kind
of get like really fine strokes with it
which I really really like by me me
personally I'm not really about the DD
brush life like it's cute but so I just
used one of my own and basically girls
and boys we just like assume you guys in
high I mean oh by the way I'm using
medium I just like dipping it really
quickly gonna start like during the
shape that I'm after as you can see I
kind of like draw the tail of my ROM
because it's just really sad in like
non-existent and I have a scarf through
my eyebrow and I always know a good
eyebrow product when he can cover up my
scar and this one literally can as you
can see and then at this point
whatever's left on the brush I'm just
gonna like do something like this like I
draw two lines and then I kind of just
like fill in between kind of like that I
know now as you can see that the front
is way lighter then the end which is
exactly why one and then I have an air
freshener it just keeps like and then do
you know one of my favorite things about
this I wrap it up where is like a liquid
product so obviously the products really
thin so it's so easy to create like fake
hairs at the front of your eyebrow I
pick up the smallest amount of product
and all that I do is basically just like
flick like this to create little hairs
at the front of my eyebrow I don't know
I just love this product I feel like it
really has defined my eyebrows but kept
it looking kind of natural the same
topic I still feel like it looks like
hair also this is pretty kind of some
really strange like this is just my
brain like working so you know like
eyebrow gels I like a liquid well this
is this off same consistency right and
you know eyebrow just bring back the
sort of naturalness to your eyebrow like
it emphasizes the hairs again I feel
like this is what that does like two and
one fills in your eyebrow but emphasizes
the hairs all just really couldn't to
say it does dry down it doesn't stay a
liquid like as you can see nothing comes
off I'm gonna go ahead and do this here
well attempt and then you go we'll be
back
I have eyebrows I genuinely like it I
love how my eyebrows look you could kind
of just tell how good it works from just
looking up a face I'm just gonna like
zoom you guys oh I'm a huge superdrug
bag just like filled with I know I've
already primed
but like this is like a glowy thing and
like how can you not fit on my face you
know this is the collection illuminating
touch liquid radiance infused with gold
illuminating power instant lifts the
complexion providing a silky soft chewy
finish
it's a lot like thicker than I thought
I'd be but that's a bit funky smell it
was that like even done anything or am I
just blinded can you guys see any
difference with my scheme right now
because to be completely honest I don't
my hands are covered in gold reflux but
my face isn't like I'm sure that's not
how this is supposed to work it
literally hasn't done anything well
that's a flop however I do have high
hopes for this maybelline superstay at
24 our full coverage foundation 24-hour
waiting products going to be 24-hour I'm
like really go really but it does take
full coverage on it and you know how I
feel about full coverage anything for
coverage I'm like I got the color 51 at
caramel beige which maybe a little bit
too dark but we'll work with it also
it's a good day to test on it because
I'm also really excited because I picked
up the Real Techniques miracle body
complexion sponge and gosh look how look
how big this is like for real though it
is wet as well and look at it like this
is joy freakin Norma's I feel like I'm
gonna be able to cover my face in like
0.2 seconds and I'm happy about that
puppet puppet so really nice consistency
it's not weird to say but like I just do
makeup okay like I'm into these things
this looks really dark okay okay this
way is anybody else like this you just
don't want to use a new sponge like it's
so satisfiying like I don't want to get
this day I found thick this is oh okay
that's actually got really nice coverage
I'm using a sponge as well I feel like a
brush I feel like the coverage where the
brush would be in bloody saying oh my
god why do I kind of it like I got a
foundation bit right now I normally like
more of a gory finish and this is more
of that soft satin matte finish but I
just like eight I'm actually really
enjoying the finish I'm actually loving
the way it looks on my skin right now I
know it's it is too dark like let's just
beware why now just track it down the
neck like you know if you could just
like move for a sec that would be fast I
really like the way this looks on my
skin right now for sure
time for some concealer now this really
intrigued me because of the applicator
it's like a little sponge on the end
this is the there is a hair and it's
like
tickling the heck out of my face right
now Rimmel lasting finish 25 hour 25
hour okay I'm a breathable lightweight
medium coverage concealer I mines in the
color 200 light medium coverage see
again when it comes to concealer I'm
like give me full like you're you need
to conceal but this could be really nice
because it says it's breathable so it
could look really like a nice on the
skin can you guys see the little sponge
up okay and when you squid oh okay yeah
sure the sponge is a little bit awkward
like it's kind of hard but in saying
that it's not smearing the concealer
around or anything it just feels a
little bit like I'm punching myself in
the face I'm just being dramatic
but you guys know what I mean seems to
be learning out nicely oh you know I
like that I would definitely agree with
medium coverage so that's cool and you
know what the whole brief herbal thing I
get that it looks super lightweight
underneath my eyes it doesn't really
look like I have added anything extra
but it has added a little bit more
coverage I'm feeling it feeling myself I
need to stop someone stopped me okay I'm
not gonna lie I tried to cover up this
blemish I don't know if you guys can see
but it's kind of just like showing again
could be the foundation though like once
the foundation set you can't touch it
sort of thing why won't you cover whoo
no way actually before a powder my skin
I'm gonna put this on what I haven't set
my foundation because it's a liquid
highlighter I've had so many of you guys
messaging me asking me to try this out
because I love the iconic drops they're
not my favorite thing ever and you guys
said that these may be a tube so we will
see this is the mega revolution liquid
highlighter this is in a liquid
champagne or champagne that's something
I just sounded like an alcoholic like I
love champagne
I just love alcohol packaging is really
cute yes make a revolution three away
it's definitely a thicker consistency I
don't know if you guys can see the
sponge isn't actually blending it out
can you see that that is really really
pretty I don't think it says like like
we're about thank you man as the iconic
ones how many like drops is up in this
video like 20,000 I don't know if you're
on way more of a budget I definitely
think this is a nice alternative do I
think it's a tube no but do I think it
you know it's a good alternative yeah
another makeup revolution product this
is the revolution baked and finish a
luxury of baking powder
oh no I've just read on the back it says
ghost finish ghost finish I'm like a
Nolan wake up girls I'm just gonna like
pray that it is an evil white cast on my
face all right
hey guys nothing on my like Marissa's
fine dust that off because I really why
am I like white oh god it has stayed why
no going oh my god Oh Jen you don't
think I can use this on the rest of my
face guys right I feel like I can't
cheat though first impressions first
impressions actually to be fair putting
on a small amount is not that bad it's
when you try to bake with it but it's
meant to be a bacon finish powder so
that was literally such a close call I
genuinely thought we were done for then
I thought that's it that's it Jordan I
feel like it's also kind of clung to
places and kind of making me look a
little bit patchy let's just hope
they're like a bit bronze or something
will make this better
I feel like bronzer helps I actually
picked up a face powder for bronzer I
don't know about you guys but it's so
hard to find matte bronze is like
hanging about so I just picked up this
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
face part of it in a darker shade this
is in caramel yeah caramel it's kind of
light on camera but I feel like it looks
like it'd be quite a nice bronze re
shade I don't know we'll give her go
it's not too bad you know it's stuff
like a nice warm
color I'm kind of having to go in and
sort of build up on it but then again
this isn't a bronzer it's a face powder
so like what do I expect you know I mean
it's bronzing up my skin it's doing what
I wanted it to I mean if you're
struggling to find Matt bronzers as well
what check out like a face powder cause
I think it works I've sort of just
covered up all of the glow that this
make a revolution highlighter gave me
but I genuinely don't like the way that
powder has made my face fill it
literally feels like my face is the
Sahara Desert I'm gonna have to use some
fixed us because honestly my face was so
drop now sure this is the Milani baked
blush in Bella Bellini now I have the
flumino so I think it's cool and I love
that bar that literally done nothing
that looks so pretty like a pinky gold
wow this is gonna be so pigmented whoa
can you see how glowy that is I actually
think this is a highlight in my face
more than it is blushing my face
blushing my face oh I actually think I
love that blush like if you like glowy
cheek products you are gonna love this
highlighter I have this makeup
revolution pearl lights loose
highlighter first welcome you just
talked about the size of this part like
this is literally gonna last me a
lifetime they have a bunch of colors as
well I think I might use this one this
is the true gold from the name it was
literally right in front of me oh my god
she get a little bit scared to use loose
highlighters I'm not gonna die like they
legit got everywhere just because I feel
like it's really easy to go overboard
wait
he's overboard with highlighter even a
thing okay can you guys show those that
is like gold I know living for it though
like the smallest amount goes the
longest way I love that color I don't
even think the camera is picking up how
gold is it is really gold but when I
look forward it hasn't left like that
gold strip actually to be fair it kinda
reminds me of you know the Fen TV you
see the fence EBT trophy wife
highlighter genuine minds me of that
way more wearable like way more wearable
I think it's safe to say that I am going
probably like really really picky and I
mean I've used loads of highlighters so
like I think that's why I know it's
these things it is more of a drier
highlight what I mean by that is it does
look like powder on the skin it doesn't
look super wet but I still really really
like it I look how much product you
getting here it is so worth it so let's
be real if you're on the hunt for you
know an affordable highlighter
check out these I'm really excited to
use their so for the first time i've
swatched a few shades but i've not used
it on my actual chair i have the
revolution at south ultra eye shadow it
looks so fab time buzzing to use on my
eyes so i've just bought you guys in a
little bit
prime my eyelids with a little bit of
this same concealer I mean I always use
consider anyway so how the hell am I
going to blend out my freaking with this
just you know I have absolutely no idea
like no idea what I feel like to do so
I'm just gonna like roll with it hope
for the best
I'm gonna take this take that it's like
the white shade just - oh no a fallout
was not too bad just to set this in
place I don't know why I'm using the
smallest brush ever to do this I
genuinely have forgotten to pick up any
eye makeup brushes once I guess own shoe
chair come running back I'm back here
this shade is kind of calling my name so
I'm gonna like dabbing that dabbing that
oh that's nice
as always just ignore this our corner
cuz I clean up at the end I think I said
that in like every make of it yeah do
you know what though this is actually
burning out really nicely I am going in
quite a few times just to like build up
the pigment but I don't ever think
that's a bad thing cause sometimes you
don't want to you know dip it in and be
like oh crap f dot my eye it's know what
I'm gonna mix this color and also the
red to make like already brown just
popping this right in the crease I'm
actually so impressed like this palette
is what like 810 pounds something like
that look honey shade you get as well
and the quality is amazing I mean I'm
probably not doing it like the best
justice ever cuz I'm not the best with
eyeshadow or just makeup in general I'm
definitely no naked surrounds that so
god that girl complained oh sure I don't
know why but this green screaming my
name so I think I might cut crease my
eye and then put the green on a little
bit of concealer I'm using that same
Rimmel concealer that see if you like
Greece your concentration right now oh
god no I gotta make it on this oh I time
for the green there is a teeny bit of
fall out like no biggie but I'm gonna
wet my brush to see if I can like really
you know get that color on there yes
like it's so fab dry but I think any
eyeshadow that's this formula like this
or finish works so much better where I'm
just gonna take some of the black and
deepen this I actually can't get over
how affordable this palette is as well
if you're on a budget and you're on the
hunt for an affordable but still far
palette honestly check this one out oh
yeah I remember this mascara literally
looked so cool so this a thing max back
to lash crown mascara why I look so
interesting was the brush hey look at
this brush oh my god I'm such a bee
youtuber right now no but for real they
look at this brush so it has like a
normal mascara wand on one side and then
as this will weird like bull thing on it
I don't know I don't actually know what
that's for
to be honest can you guys see my lashes
right now that is like super separating
and super lengthening I actually read up
about what this little crown bit does
it's meant to basically allow you to
define bits of your lashes so go on the
tips of them like this do you know what
I actually relaxed with Zara I was
worried that it might come across a
little bit kind of gimmicky if that
makes sense but it actually isn't it's
nice and thin so I can get right to the
base of my lashes and really comb
through everything even though my lashes
do look fab I am gonna apply falsies cos
you know about that life this is legitly
best - book of life to even exist in the
entire universe now not to sound like
because that's not me at all but I don't
typically like drugstore lashes I kind
of like my lashes to be really wispy and
thick and full kind of like faux mink
style lashes and the drugstore kind of
never seems to like half that until I
found these I Laura I've stepped up
their lash game man like they've stepped
it up these look so fab as soon as I saw
these I even went to my mom I was like
mom and she was like they're you Jordan
they you he
the ILA Lux Phil Guri this is how they
look as you can see they're really wispy
and thick looking so excited wear these
I think the regular I low lashes are
like just under six pounds and these
ones which like they're faux mink effect
ones are just over six pounds so
honestly the price difference wasn't
that much and I think these ones are so
much nicer I've better lash glue dry it
is definitely safe to say that I am
obsessed with these lashes like these
are drugstore how
oh I haven't applied mascara on my
bottom lashes let me just M do that real
quick
whoa look how long that made my bottom
eyelashes holy moly also I did just put
a couple of colors underneath my lash
line and gold in the inner corner still
from that soft palate I don't actually
really like my eyes with lower lash
mascara on but hey so I don't actually
have any new lip products here to share
with you guys I think I'm just gonna go
for a classic noodle lip I'll show you
my favorite nude lip combo that I've
been wearing at the moment best part
about it it's about all drugstore so I
take the body shop lip definer so their
lip pencil in I don't know right now but
I will find it and leave it below I just
lie my lips with this this is such a
nice neutral pinky Brown nude lip color
and then I take the l'oreal lip paints
in 208 off-white i just fill it in the
reason why i love this lip combo hello
this the lip line is slightly darker
which means i can we like to find my
lips and then the new color i see is
super nude which like that's my kind of
vibe it's like the two together means i
could have a really nude lip but still
have like defined lips it's not make
sense i don't know if it necessarily
goes with the eye look but can you do me
there not to finish everything off i
have this setting spray this is the kiss
pro touch makeup setting spray
long-lasting an oil control that's legit
what i need i knew the brand kiss for
doing like nail stuff but i didn't know
they did make up until i went to the new
york gem beauty makeup over something
like hey we do makeup now I was like
okay okay I'll see you
I've never even tried this let's see how
Oh oh that feels good it's the Mistral
that's nice it's not superfine and I
feel like I'm king where well I'm
feeling refreshed so is everything for
my face done what's up do you know what
there wasn't anything in this video that
I hate it the only thing I definitely
won't be using again is the make a
revolution bacon finish powder like it's
not for me it just left that white cast
which I should have read the back it
does say guys finished though but it
just made my skin feel like so dry and I
was like oh and also the collection
instant illuminate and touch thing like
that was just a bit of a flop but apart
from that I honestly liked everything
that I tried and I will be using
everything again so that's good my top
favorite things of course the iconic
brow product is so unique and so good I
love the lashes I love so I shadow
palette I also really really like the
foundation for a drugstore foundation
that is good hopefully it lasts really
well cuz if it does or girl I think I
found a new truck sell foundation law
really much is still in my heart but
like come through Maybelline with that
coverage hopefully it lasts well in fact
in the scription box below I'll leave my
thoughts on how when it lasted so you
know you guys know that so check that so
yeah that it's all from me you guys
thank you so so much for taking the time
to watch this video subscribe if you
want to if you want and I'll hopefully
see you guys in my next video
