to be a kind of try of the brushes that
I had in my last video so many of you
asked if I could try and test these out
in a video so that's exactly what I've
done for you guys it is the 7-piece kind
of Real Techniques bold metal brush
dupes and then the toothbrush brush
that's been going around a lot recently
also I thought this was a perfect time
to record the makeup look that I had in
my how I style my short hair video so
many of you have been asking about that
makeup look and this is that look so if
you do want to know how I got that
makeup look then just keep watching okay
so I'm going to try and make this look
look as similar as I can to that video
the main thing I'm going to stick to is
sort of the lip color and the eyeliner
because that's what you guys wanted to
see the most but the rest the products
are going to be a bit different because
these are just what I've been loving at
the moment
so before you primary skin using the
Nivea men post-shave bond as per usual
so for my foundation I'm going to use
the Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
and and then I'm gonna be using this
toothbrush brush which I got in my last
video I think it was which was my dress
think hall and and I haven't used this
yet and you guys wanted to see this in
action so I'm going to use it today so
all I'm going to do is I'm just going to
dot my foundation on my skin
it feels so strange to kind of be
swiping my foundation on and not tapping
but so far so good
there's a few kind of brush strokes here
and there but if you just tap over them
with the brush they instantly go away so
hmm it feels really nice on the skin as
well like it's so soft and it doesn't
really feel like I'm tugging or anything
like that it feels really good so I
really like this brush
we're so cheap as what I think it was
like a dollar something so for my
concealer today I'm going to be taking
the Rimmel match perfection concealer in
0:30 classic beige
look so weird blender out and use one of
these evolved metal brushes dupes that
also appeared in my last video and you
guys wanted to see these in action too
so I'm going to use one of these to
blend out my concealer I'm gonna take
the kind of pointed foundation brush and
just blend that in its gonna use my
finger to just finish blending that out
a little bit more now what just to set
the underneath of my eyes I'm going to
of course take my Laura Mercier loose
setting powder this is like my favorite
just going to take this and just pack it
underneath my eyes
then while that's baking I'm just gonna
go ahead and quickly fill in my brows
I'm going to take the little angled
brush that come in that Jeep set as well
and see how well this works
I actually think I've done a really
really good job of filling in my brows I
know if you guys can see but the brush
as well is just really really thin so
it's really nice to kind of mimic those
hair strokes and just get a really nice
kind of defined brow add a little bit
more kind of color underneath I'm going
to take the l'oreal glam bond cushion
and just use this as my kind of bronzer
base i guess
just set the rest of my face and going
in with the L'Oreal infallible 24 hour
powder and also another one of these
brushes this is the powder brush haven't
used this yellow see how this works this
brush is so soft I love this brush just
to bronze up my skin I'm of course gonna
take my Mac give me Sun like I think I
always use this it's just my favorite so
I'm just going to contour a little bit
using the Maybelline little contour and
highlight palette they come out with I'm
going to take that on this contouring
brush now I have used this before as you
can tell I was way too excited to use it
so I already have but you guys can see
how it works on camera so
I just love this brush as well because
it sort of creates that line but it also
blends it at the same time because it's
sort of got that like fluffy feeling to
it just add a little bit more color I'm
going to go in with this Rimmel and
compact and I'm going to take this
amazing blush color at the top here like
reminds me so much of NARS orgasm it's
got that kind of like gold running
through it then I'm going to take it on
this little brush brush from that and
bold metals dupe collection as well
haven't used this yet so we'll see how
it applies the blush it just blended the
blush in so nicely as well and it's like
the perfect size as well I think for
blush it's not too small not too big you
can kind of apply the color precisely
where you want it but it sort of blends
in with the rest so again another brush
that I like it's to highlight my
favorite part I'm going to go in with my
matte cream color base in shell this is
like I go to when it comes to
highlighter I use it actually as a base
because it just you know it it just
holds my highlighter so well so
so two highlighters that I love to use
the sleek sauces highlighting palette
this sort of gold one here and my Mac
soft and gentle I'm going to go for this
one today and I'm actually going to take
it on this brush
really kind of like blended the
highlighter into the rest of my makeup
whoa I like this brush a lot I have
stuff all over my hand and didn't even
realize to print my eyes I'm going to go
in with the Mac soft ochre Paint Pot as
per usual this is my favorite I'm going
to take this little domed brush the
shadow is just so simple I just go in
with my bronzer and just work this a
little bit into the crease and that's
literally it and then I do some eyeliner
so just go ahead and pop this into the
crease
so for my Niner is kind of hard to
explain but what I basically do is I
line my upper lash line just like normal
and then when I get more towards the
outer corner I bring the line out away
from my lash line and then I fill in
that little gap that it makes and then I
kind of draw the wing up and then bring
it back in hopefully when I'm doing it
you'll see exactly what I mean
it looks just something like this
in the video I was wearing false lashes
but on an everyday basis I don't
actually wear false eyelashes I just put
on mascara so that's what I'm going to
do today our for mascara I'm gonna use
one of my absolute fave this is the
Maybelline at lash sensational just
makes my lashes look just so long
ill mascara trick that I do is once my
lashes are dry I go in with actually a
different mascara and I don't know why I
just prefers to go in with a different
mascara you can use the same one and all
that I do is I just go along the sort of
like the backs of the tips of the lashes
and I don't know why it just tends to
just extend them even more
so in the video you guys really wanted
to know what was on my lips and this was
the combination I use so I took the
Primark and lip liner in what's this in
dark pink and just line my lips with
this
the main lip color I used in the video
was to buy color pop I think as he
pronounces tul le so that was the lip
color guys
this is the final look you guys I just
want to really quickly say about these
brushes because they were part of the
video as well now the foundation brush I
do really really like it can leave a few
streaks in your foundation but if you
just pack with the brush gets rid of
them and I really like the way left my
face looking and feeling and this brush
feels so soft as well so honestly for
like a dollar this is definitely worth
it and then the Real Techniques brushes
I love these even more these are amazing
they're really good quality haven't
experienced any shedding with them yet
so soft my free favorites will probably
have to be the blush brush the powder
brush and the contour brush I'll leave a
link to my previous video which tells
you guys where I bought these in the
description box below so if you do want
to check them out you're more than
