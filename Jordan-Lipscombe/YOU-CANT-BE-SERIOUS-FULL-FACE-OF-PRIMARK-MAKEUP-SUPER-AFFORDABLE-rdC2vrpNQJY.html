right now get my hair back okay now I
look like I'm about four hey guys it's
Jordan so I took a trip down it's a
Primark actually not just one Primark it
was actually three because this interest
hot to find I knew the kind of makeup I
was looking for in one Primark had one
thing another had another and then rich
but I managed to get my hands on a bunch
off their makeup so I noticed out in
today's video we're gonna see how goods
Primark actually is because I'm not
gonna lie I've heard a lot of good
things about Primark and makeup
especially their more newest stuff
apparently through up their game so
we're going to find out together I'm
actually very excited because let's be
real
Primark makeup is hella cheap so if it's
good I have everything here pretty much
for a full face of makeup the only thing
the only little thing that I didn't
manage to pick up was an eyeshadow
palette because honestly know them like
took out my pickle
night I just didn't really see anything
that kind of like grabbed me you know so
I just didn't I just don't bother anyway
let's just do this is jump in let's see
what what this part makeup has to offer
okay first off primer so I picked up two
different like types here I've got my
like pore filling you know nothing I
don't also have a primer water I don't
really know how I feel about these
things foreigners do they do anything I
don't know this is the one I'm gonna
start with this is the PS in Stegall
perfecting stick prime skin and
minimizes the appearance of pores and
basically it's just like a stick roll-up
kind of like situation it's two pound
fifty as well by the way I don't know
why I have the urge to smell like
everything but it doesn't know anything
I'm just gonna like oh hmm feels a tad
bit like kind of greasy but you know
what you're working with out I'm just
can use my fingers so kind of like blend
some lives in oh you know what actually
as soon as you start bending it in it
kind of just like droids like that
doesn't actually feel that grease
anymore which I'm really happy about
because like Anna with my foundation
like slipping and sliding I can't really
tell if it's down much to my poor still
you'll notice I'm gonna have to see that
with foundation but I don't know why I
always feel like primers are a bit off
like that like mere makeup products you
know I'm low-key excited to use this
because honestly my skin right now feels
like drier then
okay I'm gonna be here for the next 20
years trying to open this I don't want
to use my teeth Oaks I already like weak
from my Invisalign finally my me nope
we're not that yeah I thought we were
okay so the primal lawyer claims to prep
skin for makeup application hydrates and
refresh it's silicone free alcohol-free
and all your free that's actually really
good
it's free from a lot that feels so good
it has like a slight fragrance to it
nothing crazy it's just like a little
bit like kind of flowery but it's not
bad at all though and it's made my skin
feel really like okay girls and boys am
I excited to try this
you bet your ass I am these are the my
perfect color foundations this one in
particular that really foam like well
these ones in particular are the matte
foundation it says they are medium to
full coverage matte finish and oil-free
I remember they also had this foundation
in like a squeezy tube form I think that
was like a semi matte while never
foundation is thick don't like lose
different rows which is actually kind of
impressive like okay Primark I see you
have to be honest with you the reason
why I picked up this one is because
cause of the pump free pound each you
get oh my god you get full t mail in
here that's ten mil more than the
average foundation now right after about
you guys
Primark have upped their goddamn game
with their foundation shades I remember
ages ago when I because I've tried it
there like foundations before their
foundations were like hella pink and I
just pink foundation tones I just I
can't but they had some testers out and
i swatched these and I was pretty
impressed I got the colors toffee and
new toffee I think it's gonna be a bit
too dark at the most my fake tan is like
washing off now and then nude with party
be too light so I'm gonna like mix them
together by the way it might literally
dark my first apply it to my face by and
matching my foundation to my neck not my
face or my fake tan is washed off my
face right now which is why I'm looking
a little bit like Casper anytime soon uh
oh my god that was like such a good
color I have some breakouts here so
let's see how good it is it covering
these are are you ready
hmm that's not too bad you know I
definitely would say it's more of a
medium coverage for sure I really like
the way it's blending out though like
it's super easy sometimes matte
foundations especially the ones that are
more on the affordable side can
sometimes be very sticky not really want
to like blend out my hair my her oh good
yep foundation in there okay no I don't
know whether this is because the like
sponge because it's obviously damp but
this is not on that foundation like it's
just mirror I might like really chewy
right now I'm like borderline looking a
little bit like sweaty Bay I'm just
adding more and it seems to be building
quite nicely too it's not you know
coming off like Victoria sponge cake it
just looks really nice I'm actually
really really impressed I love it when
videos like this go off to a good start
because then I have faith in like
everything else and just filled it Oh
actually wait okay so in there my
perfect color range they have like a
stick like once I can see a lot it kind
of looks like Maybelline fit me which
you know I would be so excited to try
cuz maybe the fit me is one of my
favorite concealers but I went to three
different Primark and I could not find
that concealer for the life of me but I
found this one and I'm really not like
excited to try it because I really don't
like concealers like this you know not
like stick crayon II kind of form I
don't know what it is they kind of
cringe me out but I didn't want to cheat
and use any other concealer because you
know when is it to be a full face of
Primark so I'm just gonna like I'm gonna
suck it up I'm gonna do it
but these ones could be good to be fair
because they are part of my perfect
color range which so far it's been
treating me well these are the my
perfect color concealer sticks they say
they're full coverage and they have a
natural finish I picked up the colors
porcelain and cool sand because I don't
know I didn't know what I'd need to be
honest 90 P each breaks the bank to be
honest like I'm gonna start with
cool-sounding then obviously if it's not
light enough then I had a bit of
porcelain I feel like I have to compose
myself with this and I don't even know
what why am I such a very sharp Jordan
do you know what that is not as like as
I thought it would be I thought was
gonna feel like really thick and like
drag on my skin that's more as
let's see if I can cover up these much
in let's see how they blend out oh it's
easy I thought it doesn't actually look
that bad
drop my sponge it feels a little bit
sticky though like I like quite a
liquidy concealer I can feel like it's
really hydrating and it just is easier
for me to blend out this does feel a
little bit like I have to admit that the
coverage is nice like there's nothing
nothing I'd change about that doesn't
feel like greasy or anything it just I
can just feel it there what do I think I
don't hate it
I definitely don't love it though would
I use it again probably not the only
thing I'm not the biggest fan on is like
the feeling of it I definitely think I
want like the one concealer is like that
one bit in like a liquid form then I
don't see there to be a problem I just
saw the worst thing ever I've tried way
worse I don't know I just don't like the
feeling I'm gonna set everything in
place now so the only powder I found was
this banana powder I'm gonna use it to
set like my face and I'm really hoping
it doesn't make me like you but it
should be fine because it's marshy too
yellow so this is the PS since they go
open on a powder you loose powder to set
makeup and even complexion and it's for
all skin tones and it's four pounds
which for this huge tub which this is
huge how much is in here 40 grams those
boots oh god I hope that's kid the
absolute freaking crap out of me I think
I like dying then come back to life
again Wow oh my kind of sits in like the
tiniest lid ever like let's attempt to
bake let's do it oh that is a really
nice color that's not too yellow the
faces I pour honestly I'm gonna use a
really small amount just to set this all
in place
I know Primack do do a do do they do a
powered in the looks like this by it is
just a normal saying powder but I
couldn't find that one I'm gonna dust
this away actually cuz I scared it might
go yellow alright okay okay well if it
wasn't that before I definitely out now
I like that it's a nice job it's at my
face if you guys watch my last video
which if you haven't seen it I will link
it up here case you wanna go check it
out I run out of my Primark skinny brow
pencil which by the way is one of the
best eyebrow pencils I've ever used and
it's only 2 pounds so good and I didn't
manage to pick any more up but I found
this free and one brow precision pencil
and
it kinda reminds me that the body shop
once you have like a pencil on top here
you have a powder in here and then you
also have a brush just on the end I
picked up in two colors because honestly
I just I had no idea wide B I picked up
brown and tobacco I think I might use
Brown though I don't know why it's just
kind of calling my name a little bit the
only thing is is the brow pencil itself
is like a little triangle shape it's not
that really thin pencil which I normally
like but we're not gonna like you know
we're gonna judge
we don't judge over here don't say I'm
judging there just Claudia packaging
okay stir well she pigmented children
you need to blame a kid you're gonna
create the shape that I won you know you
want I'm not mad at that then fill it in
a little bit filling my little scarred I
have through this eyebrow which if you
didn't know I have a scar free this
eyebrow because when I was younger I
fell off my high chair
and here radiator and like split my head
open I know kind of gross sorry I'm so
glad I was little enough not to like
remember that but who's like I probably
warmed everywhere it's definitely the
right color that's for sure I don't
think I would go darker than this
personally and then as you guys may or
may not know who I really like to use a
power at the front of my eyebrows at the
moment I feel like it creates that
softer front of your brow rather than
that harsh light you know and this comes
with like a little ball of powder
I'm just taking a look with concealer
just to clean up like I normally would
that's actually pretty good right if I
mean completely honest I do prefer the
skinny brow pencil that they do just
because it's a little bit less waxy than
this pencil here but the fact this comes
with a pencil a powder and a brush all
in one for two pounds I can't complain
though I like a really calm it was easy
enough to use I didn't find it like
difficult or anything like that I rate
that I have to say there so far I am
super duper impressed look at that like
that is so easy once that's cleaned up
it will be done anyone else have an
eyebrow that's like way better than the
other we do foot bones are I mean they
didn't actually have that much choice I
found like a cream contour palette but I
kind of didn't want to use that but I
did find this my perfect color
mattifying a palace and this is like a
face powder but I got it in the color
caramel to hopefully like be able to
bronze up with it it was 2 pounds you
get one these little things which I
don't use them this is the color of that
which I think that could be a pretty
good bronzer shade or I have their
sculpt and blush kit which has a bronzer
blush and highlight in a looks like this
okay please tell me that that does not
look like the sleek palettes actually
looks like the spittin image like the
packaging and everything
okay I might deep into a little bit of
this but I think now that I'm looking
out the colors side-by-side this is
definitely more me I'm scared
yeah now that's the kind of color I like
I don't know what it is I like to have a
really warm bronze I think because I tan
it kind of just works for me
heads up though this is really pigmented
though look I literally definite like
once and then it's like am color bronze
then for blush I'm gonna use this one oh
did you see that powder definitely a tap
some of that off that's pretty I don't
know if the cameras picking up its got
like a slight kind of sheen to it which
I actually think looks really nice on
the skin it looks really really pink in
the pan
it's like a new thing for then on my
face I don't think it is
you know what I wasn't gonna do this but
why we're here while I put in my hand
why not I'm actually gonna take the
shake here in a console with it I'm
actually like praying but this doesn't
make me money cuz we're going good so
far
whoa I love how my reactions off that
I'm a literary just like sounds that's a
really really nice contour color I
really really like this little palette
how much were you four pounds bugs
everyone's favorite part now the glow
I've actually used a Primark highlight
palette before I have it I think is the
bronze one it's so good like the
highlight is like blinding it's so good
so I'm really excited to try this one
this is their pure glow highlight
palette and the colors in here
look they just look right on my street
okay do you have a white you have a pink
you have a light gold and then also a
darker gold
I feel like this palette will suit so
many skin tones which is fab it was a
5-pound it's just so so good and look at
the packaging as well it's pretty cute
it's like marble and rose gold I really
want to swatch them should I do it
holy guacamole and now I'm excited I
think gonna take this color fast I'm
gonna use a dry brush we can really like
see how it goes holy crap that is
literally like blinding tears dry as
well they are not playing around they
came in this game like they came to win
I'm like another glazed doughnut another
Krispy Kreme I'm actually shook right
now I just took a stop sign in my head
I'm like this is five pounds so not only
is this like super affordable but they
have a color for like every skin tone in
here it just it just works onto the eyes
now really quickly that I just want to
say I am NOT like a bit like not the way
my base makeup looks like what the hell
this is Primark and the only thing so
far that haven't really liked is on the
floor apparently um is these little
concealers yeah like I said I'm
fortunately I didn't pick up any
eyeshadow palettes nothing really in my
pry marks
anyway were like that great but I have
seen some good eyeshadow palettes from
Primark I just they weren't in my store
for me to get but I do have eyeliner so
actually you know what should I bet some
of my brothers are just like all over my
lid for like a little bit of color I'm
just gonna put it like in not in I'm
definitely not putting it in my I put my
lids in the crease and just like buff
owl I do this a lot you know like put
one color all over my lid and just like
buff out the colour as well is really
really nice really nice this is
basically two and one like actually no
three and one because it is technically
a powder I use it as a bronzer and now
as an eye shadow like saving some coins
cool man now to do the wings so I've
tried the Primark you know the little
pot I don't know what the little likeyou
I'm screwing it's like a little I just
thought that it's just like a little pot
liquid eyeliner it's a pound and it is
so so good like so good and obviously I
didn't want to use that again in the
video cuz already used it before so saw
this island I thought I'd give it a go
this is the spot see Primark one of the
iconic
eyeliner pen flexible tip for precise
and easy application and it also says
it's water-resistant smart
proof and long-lasting if that is not
everything you want in an eyeliner I
don't know what is it's only one hand I
do actually got a nice like fine point
you guys don't see that get my like
beauty side out it's really easy to get
into that inner corner as well with the
applicator now that I'm stance like fill
everything in I'm not gonna lie it's not
the blackest eyeliner I've ever used I
definitely think the one in the pot is a
lot darker it is start like run out in
random places which is a little bit
annoying so I mean the more I'm using it
I don't hate it it was really easy to
use to be fair like I've managed to do
that wing really really easily
the applicator is a little bit like
stiff I'm not gonna lie and it's not the
blackest thing ever and it does run out
occasionally the more I'm using it the
more I'm like yeah can you guys see
sometimes I like draw lit it's just not
it's just not really happening we're
gonna switch the other one see that is
like already so much better between the
two which once again so easy the little
pot the pen actually I've tried like
better pen eyeliners for sure time for
some mascara now this one they had lo
some scars to be fair but this one I
don't know why I just like the sound of
it this is the lash contour mascara so
it says it freely curls it lengthens and
it has mega volume oh my god I didn't
see that before penny has a two sided
brush to cow and give mega volume
honestly how much was it oh it was to
power mother way oh I don't know if you
guys can see that but it has like a
longer side and a shorter side
that's really interesting whoa already
that is length from my eyelashes so much
okay this is gonna sound so strange but
you can really feel your lashes gripping
onto the little bristles I like that
feeling though cuz I really feel like
it's really like my lashes why does this
mascara low-key make me look like I'm
wearing false eyelashes can you see that
there play Primark like it definitely
does everything that it says
that's what it says on the tin I like it
I mean if you're into that more like
thicker looking eyelash you will
definitely like this as well it's gonna
sound really weird but it kinda makes my
lashes look cool like all over the place
in a good way
I mean so it kind of makes it look like
I'm wearing like wispy false eyelashes
do you guys think it's a good am I'm of
course gonna be sticking on some
eyelashes because when we're not right I
have picked these ones up before in
Primark and I love them these are the so
sue I guess a sec Suzanne Jackson
eyelashes in the style Kylie they're 5
pounds
apparently their exclusive design for
Primark so it still counts I know that
Primack do have their own eyelashes that
are like a pound but honestly none of
them really like real me so I'm gonna
stick to ones that I know I will
definitely use and you can reuse these
loads by the way need to trim these down
look these little baby scissors oh okay
that's my more glue than I needed what
am i doing why are you wait feel a
stretch to try these eyelashes though
pretty sick look at these they're so
pretty
okay so we're stuck on we're all good
I'm gonna put a little bit of bronze
under my eyes really quickly just so I
could tie everything together on suit
lips now that this is actually a part
that I'm really excited for because I
found these lip kits I'm a little bit
like I want to try them they only get
lippy like little lip kits so these ones
on the matte ones so you get a liquid
lipstick and a lip liner in there for
three pounds three mother-effing pounds
how they do I don't know I picked up two
colors so I got the color flutter which
is this amazing like nude shade and it
also picks up the color girl's world
which is this looks like such a pretty
like pinky purple I don't know what
color to go for so I think I'm just
going to do both of them I didn't show
you one and then the other not together
cuz I mean I mean you could totally do
that you makeup has never always but
let's start with a lip liner the noise
it just broke about say there really
creamy creamy enough that it broke
enough the liquid lipstick oh okay
that's definitely not the same color
that's on the outside I'm actually kind
of happy about that because I prefer
this color the formula is really really
thin which I really really like cuz I
always feel like with liquid lipsticks
you can really feel them on your lips
but when they're a little bit thinner
not so much the actual like dopher
applicate is a little bit hard not good
I was a little bit like it's really not
a problem though the color is actually
really cute it's a lot Pinker than I
thought it would be but I actually
really like that and honestly I
literally can't fit on my lips I like
this I don't even want to take it all
that was like okay this is girls world
so lip liner so it goes so pigmented so
creamy wow I really do sound like a big
area okay liquid lipstick
come on though how are these only three
pounds can someone you like tell me this
is such a cool color as well it's like
that really vibrant purple I don't know
many wear shades like this but I'm kind
of living for it though that wasn't
patchy this is one layer I'm like what
the Frick and I kind of can't get over
how comfortable these are I honestly
can't feel it on my lips like if you
haven't tried these go to Primark now
and get them because holy guacamole
I managed to get my hands on some set
and spray so to finish off I'm gonna use
this is their pH R which means perform
hydrate recover cooling send spray it
was four pounds the fact that this said
cooling I was like all in cuz I love
that feeling shake well I'm scared okay
cool definition of open my mouth that
has a really strong fragrance and it
smells like sweets I kind of like it
let's see if it's cooling it definitely
feels like super refreshing I can kind
of understand the cooling it does feel
that my face does feel cooler than the
rest of my body but it's not just
because I put saying spray on it I don't
know final thoughts okay I feel like you
guys probably already know my final
thoughts to be honest the fact that this
is all Primark products on my face right
now there's a little bit crazy to me
there are so many good products like
where are we being I'm like beyond
impressed with some of these products
and like I don't mean impressed in like
a degrading ways to be like is Primark
like I freaking love Primark but I'm
just like shook at the price of these
items for what you get free pounds for a
foundation one pound from an eyeliner
like free pound for a liquid lipstick
and a lip liner there was only a couple
things I didn't like that the concealers
they're not really my cup of tea like
the stick kind of situations and also I
didn't really like the pen eyeliner but
that's just because they have another
eyeliner that's like 10 times better but
everything else I really really loved
especially the lip kits oh my god I want
them in every color now I don't really
have about 20 million lipsticks but they
are honestly like one of the best liquid
lipstick formulas I have ever tried I
also love the foundation it looks so
nice on the skin I also really like this
face powder as a bronzer oh and of
course the highlight palette like kind
of speaks for itself they were like the
top things that I love but I've really
enjoyed using all of this okay if I've
done them ups right this is me we're
talking about those so maybe not I
calculated everything up and it come to
just over 40 pounds like it was 40
pounds 90 P 40 pounds for an entire full
face of makeup like this is like full
face like eyelashes the lot that's so
good
and by the way that's for like two
primers and like an extra bronzer and
stuff you don't actually need everything
in that like that is so good basically
and moral of this video is get your ass

good ins I really hope you guys enjoyed
