excited so this contains the flesh one
lipstick flush two lipstick the venom
one venom - the blood one platoon up
sticks as well as the clear vinyl gloss
the gold metallic pigment the blood
microphone glitter the flush microphone
glitter and the venom glitter I am so
excited to see what's in here this is
the first edition limited release I love
this packaging it has sequins all on the
insides with this clear metal micro I
meant to say chrome pink packaging is
super nice I actually just got this in
the mail today and I can't wait to
review it so this is $150 which I know
can be very expensive
all the lipsticks are sold separately is
$25 and then the kits the flush kit and
the venom kit are sold at $60 each so my
girl Grande enjoy hooked it up for you
guys and we are collaborating on this
video she will have a video duping all
of these products in here and showing
you guys how you could get this exact
look for less so I leave the link for
her video right here and I leave a link
down below in the description box don't
forget to subscribe to her as well if
you aren't subscribed to her I don't
know what you're doing through life I
love her she's amazing her and Jalen
were actually here in California I think
two weekends go and we hung out all
weekend it was so much fun
so don't forget to put down your video
but without further ado I'd love to show
you guys how these lips turn out and if
they are worth it so here we go I feel
so bad breaking this packaging because
it's so pretty but we're just going to
cut it open okay I don't know how not to
make a mess I'll just pour back in the
box that it came in so we have the
lipsticks oh my gosh they're covered in
glitter
oh I decided to switch location and fill
in front of this wall instead of on the
couch out there just because I think I
like film in front of this wall more I
don't know but I really just want to hop
in and try on the flesh one color with
the flesh glitter so that's just what
we're going to do right now okay
these lipsticks glide on so nice they're
so creamy and pigmented it's amazing
this color is beautiful it's a really
nice nude it's kind of peachy almost
like an orange undertone I don't know
and then I'm just going in with the
blitter I had to remove the filter off
the top of the glitter because it was so
hard to access it so I'm just gonna like
this oh my gosh I love it I'm obsessed I
can't
the application of putting the blade on
is so simple I just finished putting the
glitter on and I am obsessed I think
this is the coolest look ever even with
these hoops I'm wearing right now the
glitter kind of matches my jewelry going
on and I just love it
the only thing is since the glitter is
so fine it gets kind of all over your
face if you really just want to take a
lint roller to your face or take some
tape to access clean up the excess I
guess no but I think this color is
amazing it doesn't really feel like I
have anything on my lips it's really
lightweight the only thing is it's like
sticking to my teeth inside of my mouth
but it doesn't bother me I'm obsessed I
think this could be such a cool look
especially if you pads them to your
eyelids and then take some cool
editorial high-end photos and be really
dope now I'm going to apply the blood
one color I'm so excited to put the
bullier on top of this because everyone
has been raving about this color red and
I have wanted to find oh my gosh it is
the most beautiful color red alright
this is the color is not real it is the
best true red it's almost a vintage
Chanel red if that makes sense
um I love it guys this would look good
on anyone skintone 100% I think it's so
pretty
I like the way it complements my
porcelain skin because I do have pale
skin I don't even have tan lines like I
just moved to California and you have a
beach more um but Wow I really love this
color okay I'm gonna have the glitter
too this one
okay I'm obsessed it's official
I feel like dorky shoes are on my lips
from The Wizard of Oz I am totally in
love this is just I'm so excited to
finally own a beautiful red lipstick
also the lipstick is really creamy so
it's not a matte or drying lipstick I
wouldn't say it's satin oh my gosh I
love the way this looks I think it is so
cool people are gonna read about this
for the holiday season this is gonna
look amazing around Christmas time oh my
gosh I'm so excited this is the Shea
venom - oh this is a really pretty full
color okay I normally never find myself
wearing such a dark color but I am
totally digging it I think this is such
a pretty fall winter color that bunch of
people are gonna fall in love with I
really like I like the way it look works
with my skin tone I think it would work
with any one skin tone I just love how
creamy these are
I don't know if you guys can tell how
you can see the sheen on it they're so
creamy they I feel like I'm wearing
chapstick right now I also must say
there's a lot of glitter in here so I'm
really happy that for the price that you
pay for you get a lot of glitter I can
sort of that a lot of glitter that is
going to be going on my lips lente
plenty of time I don't think I'll run
out unless I spill it all over the floor
but wow I really like this glitter on
top of this color as well I'm wearing a
venom - if you guys forgot I think this
looks really nice so many people are
going to rave about this around New
Year's time to put on their lips I
definitely want to wear this around the
holidays it even looks cool with these
hoops I just love the way these lips
look so fun
I'm sure stuff exists like this already
but I think Pat McGrath did a really
good
okay so I'm holding a flashlight up to
the glitter because I wanted to see how
sparkly it is do you guys just see that
oh my gosh it is so what pretty oh okay
I really want to try the gloss with the
gold pigment so I'm just going to put
some on my hand and then mix it around
so metallic can you guys see how pretty
that is okay I can't wait let's put on
our lips oh my gosh is so pigmented this
color is so fun I'm diggin it it is so
chrome like and metallic I've always
wanted to take a picture with Chrome on
my eyes and Chrome on my lips since this
is so metallic I think this would look
really cool I'm really into that wet
glossy look I don't know if this will
work it probably won't but let's just
try it I'm not bringing them all the way
up to my eyebrows right now but if I was
I think I would take a really cool
high-end or fashion editorial type photo
umm if you had a makeup artist do this
and then knew how to do it really good
all the way up to the eyebrows or
something I think that would be such a
cool shot I definitely recommend it even
though I kind of look like a crazy
person right now I totally did this and
I would totally wear this maybe if I
didn't put it on a sloppy but I
definitely love the look when your eyes
match anything that's on your lips I
think that is so cool flash one is
definitely one my favorite colors in
this collection just because I love
nudes I like how this one is a peachy
nude or it has an orange or yellow
undertone don't know if you guys can see
that flush to color is such a pretty
dark mauve it's almost like that dirty
rose color I think this would be an
amazing lipstick for it if you're going
out a night or going to lunch it's not
too dark and it's not too light my blood
one would probably have to be my
favorite color in this entire collection
because in my entire life I've tried to
find the perfect red and this is the
perfect red color it is so beautiful
blood two is a dark purple I normally
don't lean towards purple lipsticks but
if you're going for that gothy look or
something super bold with a subtle I or
subtle foundation look this lip color is
for you it is so pretty though
venom one is such a pretty red as well
this one is just a shade darker I
believe and doesn't have as much as an
orange undertone but I love how creamy
this one is and it looks really nice
with the glitter on top of it
venom two is such a beautiful fall color
it is totally a dark burgundy red you
can even consider this a dark maroon as
well which I'm totally in love with this
would look amazing on any one skin tone
