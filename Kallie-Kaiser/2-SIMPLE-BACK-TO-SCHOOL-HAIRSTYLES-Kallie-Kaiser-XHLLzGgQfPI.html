this where I was supposed to wake up and
shower today but I didn't have time
because I woke up late and I was in a
rush
unless the illusion of dry shampoo is
working right now and you can't tell
that my hair is really dirty but it
really is like my hair is just PC and
greasy PC and greasy and I bet this
happens to you guys all the time so I'm
showing you the simplest hairstyle that
you could possibly do for school if
you're in a rush that you probably don't
even need a tutorial on but I'm showing
you anyway because if you haven't done
it you need to try it I love this
hairstyle so if you ever see me wear
this it is because my hair is dirty so
it looks really messy when I'm putting
my hair up into this cute ponytail that
looks like I tried when I really didn't
I'm looking in the viewfinder because I
don't have a mirror um sometimes you
don't even need a brush for this look
honestly it's so simple I'm just taking
the front pieces leaving them down okay
when you get it to a high enough desired
ponytail you're just gonna put it in a
pony like so as you guys can see you
don't even need me to narrate this for
you and then you keep pulling it up like
this and tightening it and pulling it up
pulling it up as much as you want like
that is about desired length for me and
it's so cute I love it I wear this to
school um whenever I'm in a super rush
and it hides most of my greasy hair as
you guys can see even in the back it
hides it I think I could be wrong I've
never seen the back of my head so I
don't know but it really does hide the
greasiness don't you agree
I swear unless you reveal it but that
usually doesn't I just I always wear
this in my hair
whenever it's really dirty and it needs
to hide from the world okay and then
once you take your hair out this
hairstyle is probably so simple you
don't need me to show it to you but it's
so simple you probably haven't even
thought of it these are just hairstyles
I do when I'm really in a rush and my
hair is dirty and I want to do something
Q with it other than just wear it up
wear it down
so separate it turn on whatever side you
want whatever side you're feeling and
then I literally just freehand parted
just because these are styles that you
don't really need to perfect they can be
messy if you want them to be this okay
and then I'm taking my baggies of small
clear ponytails taking one and I
normally would French braid this right
here but I can't French braid so we're
not going I usually have my sister do it
for me um I'll do a little twist
you can even twist it up but that's if
you're not in a rush then you can take
the time to do that but yeah otherwise I
just tie this up and it just I think
it's cute it's so simple and then
obviously you need to hide the
greasiness right here so just work that
in your hair and
I don't I think this is just like
effortlessly cute it could even be
really cute for a photo shoot which I've
worn something similar to this to
Lollapalooza and my sister did French
braids up but I can't French braid I
will learn sometime but in the meantime
this is all we're doing um but yeah if
you guys want really simple hairstyles
these are my favorite and I love using
them you guys please subscribe if you
aren't already and have a lovely day I
love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
