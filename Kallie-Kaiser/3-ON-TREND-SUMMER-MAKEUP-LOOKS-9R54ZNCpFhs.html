we are doing three on trend so our
makeup looks I love all of them some are
really colorful doing in wet and then I
have an awesome bronze iam looks to show
you guys at the end I already have my
foundation down we're just focusing on
our eyes lips and then switching up
highlighters and blushes so without
further ado here we go
for the first makeup look I'm just
taking my color pop duo face hollow
right here and I'm taking the horns
highlighter shade just to set my eyes so
nothing creases as we build up the eye
shadow and then my all-time favorite
palette that I recently just bought is
this Natasha de nonne a sunset palette
and we're taking this gorgeous yellow
shade and we're putting it all over our
crease I'm just using a fluffy tapered
blending brush from morphe how gorgeous
is this color I am obsessed with it then
going to and disc reciate I'm only
focusing this orange on the outer corner
inner corner of the eye you guys have
totally seen me use this technique in my
previous makeup tutorials if you have
ever watched any of them I just filled
this up until to blend it out to my
desired liking
once that's all blended out I'm taking
this gorgeous foiled metallic eyeshadow
kind of similar to that orange highlight
shade we used earlier and I just apply
this with my finger you don't need
mastic plus or anything it is so super
shock it looks gorgeous
it definitely completes the look and
then I'm just going to be taking all of
those shades that we put on our eye and
dragging them underneath my lower lash
line I have eyelash extensions so I'm
not going to be putting any mascara on
so I'm just brushing them out with a
little spoolie brush taking that
highlighter shade that we used earlier
and putting it on my brow bone and then
I'm also going to be using the blush in
the color pop palette it is the most
gorgeous warm shade ever and I'm just
putting that on the apples of my cheeks
I haven't worn blush in so long I'm
really obsessed and then Mac soft and
gentle is one of my favorite
highlighters because it gives your face
more of a wet look I'm trying not to
overdo the highlighter because sometimes
I do and then for our lips I'm going to
be taking this gorgeous light pink
bubblegum shade from ziwei cosmetics and
I thought it was just super fun and it
made them look pop even more
that is the completed look for number
one I just thought it was super fun and
flirty and springy and I love anything
that looks really editorial so I
definitely took away too many pictures
and I posted this on Instagram but yeah
I hope you guys love this one for the
next look it is so so simple we'll only
be using one eyeshadow it's just this
gorgeous pale pink from the Natasha de
Nonna palette as well and then taking
that same morphe fluffy brush and I'm
just going to be packing this on until
desired liking again I ended up doing
quite a bit of strokes to get the color
to come out it is really pigmented but
you guys can see how white the pink is
and then I'm also just putting that
underneath my lower lash line as well to
make the eyes look really wet I'm taking
my glossy a rose bomb.com this stuff is
amazing you guys will see how easy it is
to apply I just use my finger oh and my
fake eyelash stuck okay and then I also
ended up taking just a random clear lip
gloss to make the look a little bit more
wet so it would show up on camera better
and taking the Mac soft and gentle
highlighter as well just putting on the
high points of my face Cupid's bow and
on the bridge of my nose for lips I'm
using this amazing natural lip gloss or
lipstick from glossier it's in the shade
cake you guys can see how well or how
nicely pigmented it is and then for a
lip topper I'm taking this away skinny
dip lip gloss and this completes the
whole look it's so gorgeous you guys can
see how the gold reflectors in it are so
pretty it's like wearing a highlighter
on your lips but it's made for it and
that is the completed look I just
decided to throw on a denim jacket and I
put my hair up in some scrunchies I
thought it looks kind of retro but yeah
I hope you guys loved this look as well
for the last look so easy I'm taking my
ambient lighting powder setting that for
on top of my eye primer it's in the
shade dim light and then I'm taking this
amazing contour shade from the Tasha de
Nonna and I'm just taking that on my a
cosmetics tapered blending brush
focusing that more on the outer corner
but still in the crease of my eye it is
going to be our transition shade for
this look and then I'm just darkening
that until my desired liking again and
then I'm taking this amazing really cool
rusty orange color until you I'm more of
a compact brush this one's from morphe
as well
then I'm mixing these two colors in the
palette together on the same compact
eyeshadow brush mostly just poking this
focusing this on the outer corner you
guys will see me blend it going in with
this gorgeous gold super shock I shadow
these pigments are amazing I just apply
them with my finger that's personally
how I think you're going to get the most
pigment out of them and I'm just putting
that all towards the inner corner and
middle going back to with our transition
shades and stuff just taking a small
little crease brush and brushing that
underneath my lower lash line and then
on the inner corner I'm just adding a
little highlighter shade to make the
eyes pop even more for the lips I'm
using my Bobbi Brown a huge jumbo
lipstick in the shade bear this is so so
beautiful and makes your lips look
really hydrated even though it is a
little bit more of a matte cran and then
on top of it I'm taking the issue a
liquid lipstick in the shade cold I'm
just going to be dabbing that with my
finger and dispersing it in the middle
of my lip just to give my little pop and
more of a highlighter look and then to
finish the face I'm taking my Mac soft
and gentle just putting that on the high
points of my face like every other look
that we did on here before and then that
is it after I added to my eyes I love
adding highlighters my eyes also I add
it to my collarbones if you guys are
into that but yeah I love love this glam
look I thought it was perfect for summer
night or if you're going to dinner or
something but I hope you guys love this
