excited to share my Permenter with you
guys so I live in a one-bedroom one-bath
with one of the roommate in Santa Monica
California
the dream and here's my front door and
filming this from my point of view so
when you stand in front of my front door
I'm in a hallway and then just to the
left is the bedroom and bathroom and
closet and stuff so when you walk down
the hallway here is our beautiful living
room without a coffee table we just
never invested in one I don't know why
our couch is from West Elm on the
productive day it's also a pull-out and
the chaise that makes l-shape opens up
and it's storage this carpet from living
spaces and no I don't wear matching
socks it's so fluffy and soft so
beautiful just totally opens up the
entire room the pink pillows on the
couch are also from West Elm and then
when you're standing in front of the
windows this is just what our permanent
looks like and there's my ring light and
we also have a hot tub and pool attached
to our building so you go in the jacuzzi
quite often and the pool is heated which
is so nice right next to the window we
have our TV and this amazing hanging
chair my roommate got it at a plant
nursery I don't know what store but if
you think your hand on one of these you
need to they are so comfortable and then
the pillow sitting in the chair is just
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond next to the couch
we have our dining room table is from
living spaces as well on there I have a
fake plant duranium and a gold school
that I got on Amazon always down below
and then over here we have another plant
it is from Home Depot it's so sad we
don't know if we over watered it or
under water it or just lacking sunlight
so if you know please let us know down
below and then walking into our kitchen
I'm just going to do a quick span over
the kitchen
here's our blenders are nice stove with
a dirty pot on it because we're not
perfect and then here is our fridge
there's a lot of storage in here which
is so nice and the dark wood looks
really good with our
and set and then we just have a little
post-it since this is a life this pot is
so amazing it heats up water in seconds
I got on Amazon also when you down below
for you guys and then we have this
little window enough that just looks
over our entire living room and dining
space which is really nice moving on to
the best part of the entire apartment is
the bedroom so as we walk through the
doorway my bed is the first one against
the window walking into my room this is
my side my bed is from Ikea clearly my
favorite thing is the piece hanging
above my bed is such a statement piece
there are these amazing wooden 3d lips
that my sister's best friend made she
has her own company so I'll link her
Etsy and Instagram down the long strips
box it's called the flat shop she loves
bringing people's visions to life she
also can paint murals she's just
talented as hell and these lives for the
most beautiful thing ever so if you want
to get a pair just message heard
underneath - I just have some pillows
this fluffy pillow some bed Bethany on
and then the large one is just from home
goods right next to my bed is my
nightstand I lit a candle for you guys
to make this video a little bit romantic
that fake plan is from home good and
then my nightstand and lampshade are
both from West Nell I love the look of
white lacquer with wood at the end of my
bed I have this goal hanging up on the
wall a super cool metallic chrome silver
like while that was a sentence I got
that from home good and my silver Kay is
from home goods as well I just have my
youtube blog I cried when I reach
100,000 subscribers I love you all
here's my sunglass holder with some
earrings and then this white 4 quad
storage unit is from home goods as well
I keep all my makeup I don't really
organize this in a specific way there's
some PR packages under there tampons
perfume all of that and then against my
roommates wall she actually DIY this
with nails and twine and then she
The Beatles poster hanging up above her
bed against the other side of the wall
is this IKEA desk and I see a chair it's
so simple and minimalistic I love it the
plants are both from home goods as well
I love fake plants I think it opens up
the room so much and then our hallway
which holds our closet and bathroom so
if we look to the door to the left here
is my bathroom here's our shower the
base is just a tub which you should
always have a tub I love hitting backs
so guilty here is this amazing storage
unit I found at Target on the top shelf
is mine I keep my face washes lotions
skincare mostly and then we walk out of
the bathroom here is my first closet
this one's not a walk-in it's just a
sliding door and if you want to see my
closet or I did just upload it on my
channel so just go to my videos and I'll
have it linked down below in the
description box for you guys you can
find it super easy but this is just
where I keep all my jackets oh my gosh
do I need to do laundry that is a full
hamper and then my walk-in closet which
is right next to it to the left here's
all my denim and then sweatpants and
workout clothes in the basket and I hang
up all my really nice shirts I don't
really want to fold or get wrinkly and
all my shoes are under here but dies up
