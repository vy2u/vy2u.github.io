August favorites video for anyone who
has decided to watch this I hope you
enjoy it I have been wearing this Tarte
gifted mascara non-stop this month it is
the lengthening and conditioning mascara
it holds a curl really really well it is
also a really really wet form you will
then notice and it doesn't dry out it
has awesome consistency to your
eyelashes awesome awesome product a
little something I have been putting on
my face every day this month is the bare
minerals original face powder foundation
with the broad-spectrum SPF 15 this
stuff is awesome I think it's really
nice for people that sensitive skin like
me because you're always gonna be
putting on a light powder there's a bug
on my window right now oh my gosh oh my
gosh very much security this is an
awesome product that I have been using
all the time lately is the bare minerals
ready bronzer in the shade and
skinny-dip this definitely gives your
face a really nice bronzy glow to it and
if you're looking for something that
gives you an even buildable glow all
over your face
I highly recommend this stuff it is so
awesome such a nice Jing too and it's
not shimmery at all gives your face a
really matte color this awesome nail
polish from Essie is so awesome it is
this light pink lavender color
it's so cute I am wearing it now and I
am in love with it an awesome product I
have been using lately from benefit is
the Benetint it is the gross tinted lip
and cheek stain this stuff is awesome it
makes your lips look so natural I do not
really wear it on my cheeks I might try
it soon I don't know I usually wear it
on my lips would just chapstick on the
top of it but I will
okay so I am absolutely in love with
pineapples and I purchased this shirt
from Zara and it is so cute it is this
sheer material it is full of greens and
yellows and whites and I just throw it
on with usually high-waisted pants
because it doesn't really go anywhere
below the belly button it's kind of like
a crop shirt but it's not it's just
super fun and I love it I recently
purchased two pairs of Sam Edelman shoes
which I am in love with the first pair
that I purchased RV's navy blue suede
heels that I just love they have like
blue and silver beads all over them and
they're just so strappy and fun and then
the next pair that I purchased are these
really chunky sandals that have black
leather with silver studs or beading all
over them these are just so cute and I
can't wait to wear them more recently in
the month of August I purchased three
people sunglasses and they are these
really big obnoxious clear sunglasses
with an adorable cat eye and they have
to wrap designs on the side I love these
I'll be wearing them so much because I
already
an awesome awesome candle that I
recently got at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is
this candle it's pumpkin caramel latte I
smelled it when I was in the store and I
just fell in love with it so now I
bought it and the best part about this
candle is when you light it up it smells
up your entire room and I feel like a
lot of candles don't accomplish that so
this is one of those awesome channels
that accomplish that something that will
always be my favorite no matter what
month it is is this amazing perfume
called pink sugar it is everything a
girl could want fer perfume it is the
best smelling perfume ever and I love it
