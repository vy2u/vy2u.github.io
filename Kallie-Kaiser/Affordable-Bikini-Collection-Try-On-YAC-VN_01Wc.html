I'm so excited because I'm filming an
affordable bikini collection for you
guys
all of these bikinis are from za Volcom
I will leave a link down below
description box for all of them I'm
trying on about 20 to 25 bikinis for you
guys in this video a lot of people are
skeptical on bikinis that come from
China that are cheap and they're afraid
it's not reliable
I believe in solve I think they're
really reliable I order from them before
and now I have over 20 bikinis to share
with you guys from them so they are very
affordable and I hope you guys enjoy
most of them actually all of them are
size small but I wish some of them were
size medium just because how they fit me
but I will mention in this video those
that cut in on my skin and I wish they
were a medium also if you guys want to
follow me on my Instagram it is at Cali
Kaiser
and my snapchat is Kelly Anne so here we
go this is a crochet white and black
bikini it's pretty low rise in the front
as you guys can see and you'll see when
I tried on the bottom it's not full
coverage it's a little cheeky uhm this
is so comfortable it's held up really
nice I like the way sewn together the
top is very thin so you can knit through
depending on who you are as a person
um I don't because can see how thin that
is but the back just looks like this
this one's a size small it's a very thin
material in the middle I guess it kind
of looks like neoprene but it is not
yeah I think this is really great I
think this is going to photograph
awesome this bikini is so beautiful it's
all crochet you really honestly don't
see anything through there so nothing is
going to show if you're worried about
that
here are the bottoms the bottoms could
be cheeky depending on how big your bum
is but I love the c-shell design on the
top and the bottoms I think it's so
pretty and so neat hopefully I can wear
this soon to the beach or something
because I just
the little details on it honestly this
is probably my favorite bikini that I
picked out just because it's so
flattering on and it was so inexpensive
it's just this beautiful green leaf
design with white all over it's one
piece I've lately been loving one pieces
but it's a plunging neckline which is
really hot on the back just tied like
this and it's also flattering in the
back too kind of looks like you're
wearing a bikini in the back and then
when you turn to the front boom it's a
one-piece this one is another one my
favorites I'm actually obsessed with
this red bikini only because I've never
owned a red bikini before because
they're expensive so perfect for this
video
this one has strappy neskowin on right
here the back straps are braided that
tie together and then they just have
these little fringes hanging down I
really really like this bikini has pads
so nothing's going to show through and
then here are the bottoms they're
braided across like your low-rise
section and then it's just like a cutout
of braids as well I think this red color
is gorgeous and it's not to walk it
doesn't wash me out a lot even though I
am a pale person but right now I
definitely have a spray tan I'm not
normally this tan this is another one of
my favorite bikinis the bottoms look
like this they are a little cheeky wait
that's the back this is the front I
don't know if you guys can see that
there's just cutout lines across the
hips and the top is amazing um so your
skin is just going to show through on
the cutouts and this is a really thin
material so you might knit through this
depending on how cold it is wherever
you're swimming um it's highly nice sewn
together and it is so inexpensive and
it's such a beautiful bikini I really
love the design of this bikini except
the bottoms are a bit small so I want
this soup in a size medium the bottom is
cut in on my skin a little bit but
otherwise it fits really really great
the cups or triangles on the front are
really
my knee on the side is 32c in a bra so I
would definitely go with a medium in
this suit and probably depending on who
you are - I would definitely size up
with this bikini but I love the way the
nude corresponds with the black it looks
really great and this is going to
photograph really great as well this is
so cute it's a blue it's like a baby
blue snakeskin design this is silky soft
the bottom is definitely cheekier then
most bikinis I own and then it's kind of
just like a hipster bottom kind of like
that underwear design if you know the
hipster design the top is a very thin
material but it's very silky and really
nicely made it's just ties and then the
tops are just triangles like this I
think this size small fits me great this
one is a little different than most
bikinis which I love I love anything
that's different you're kind of
obnoxious so the bottoms go like this it
says god save Queens I've no idea what
that means so if someone could comment
down below in the description box and
help me out awesome
so the bottoms were like this and
they're elastic so it definitely
stretches out and it's very comfortable
on the body it doesn't cut in but it can
cut in depending on your body type and
then here is the top you can almost
totally wear this as a bra mat under
cute knitted sweater or something like
that if you are uncomfortable wearing
something the strappy to the beach or in
a pool but again these have pads in it
this is elastic so it fits around anyone
who's in between a size small or medium
I really enjoy this bikini I think it's
kind of obnoxious and weird so yeah I
love halters of cool designs up here so
we have this gorgeous
halter bikini I wish this wasn't a size
medium just because I hope you guys can
see the width of it is not very large it
does have pads in it which is really
really nice it's sewn together really
nice for the price and I'm going to guys
can see but this is
so cool I love the design on this and
then it comes with just normal plain
black bottoms the size small of these
black bottoms with little cutouts fit
perfect they're full coverage in the
back and I just really can't wait to
photograph in this bikini I think it's
going to photograph amazing I'm normally
not the girl to go with a bright pink
and red bikini but when I read the
reviews on this one people really love
that they said it fifth grade so it's
highs like this which I really really
like the cup size of the triangles fit
great and there is padding in here so
you will not nip through this the
bottoms are so comfortable they are
cheeky though so they're a little small
I love the designs on the size with the
cutouts I think that's really cute and I
think this bikini looks really great on
camera I can't wait to wear this one too
and for how cheap it is it's made very
nice
this white one-piece had really really
great review so I was like okay I
totally have to get it it's double lunge
so you really aren't going to see
anything I have not gotten this bikini
wet so I don't know if it's see-through
or not but honestly it looks like an
amazing white bikini it's held up really
nice this so waiting on it or the
structure is really great it has like
these metal hoops that loop through the
lace and this is a small with an open
back this is really flattering on the
body the colors on this one are so fun I
absolutely adore this bikini it is a
little big on me across my chest right
here it just is a little bagging and
aligning it has a mesh detail in the
middle I don't know if you guys can see
that just because it's double lined mesh
so it's kind of hard to see through it
the bottoms cut in on my skin a little
so I definitely want on medium in the
bottom so at the top is a little bigger
so they kind of just don't go well the
other was sizing but the pattern is so
cute I love the contrast between the
black and then the pastel flowers I
really like this Vicky's knee you get an
awesome bikini for a low price
this suit is so much fun maybe if I live
in California now
I would definitely wear this surfing the
only thing is the lining is what is it's
called elastic this elastic is a little
bit stretched out as you guys can see
how it's like crimping so that's the
only thing otherwise the suit is so
comfortable I love the halter design it
does have pads in it which is really
great you definitely get an awesome suit
for the price that you paid the bottoms
fit amazing and when I say amazing they
literally fit perfect um also if you're
in between sizes of a size small and
medium it doesn't matter because this
stretches so it's not going to cut into
your skin which is really great I love
this bikini the front looks like this
with a nude background and then the back
is just all black this is full coverage
so I small the top looks like this I
wish this top didn't have pattern just
because it pushes me up more than I
would like and in a bikini I kind of
just like to feel relaxed and free you
know but yeah I really love the design
of this bikini I think it's really cute
the only thing right here is like near
the crotch it kind of like hangs down
lower it's a little baggy that could
just be from my body I don't know how
but yeah I think this photographs really
well and it kind of looks like the beach
bunny swimwear bikini which I love these
are probably my favorite book bottoms I
received I know they're really small I
don't know why they're so tiny
but when they're on they don't look this
small um they have really strappy sides
it's like a light pink snakeskin design
or Python design I guess you can say the
back is not full coverage is very cheeky
and the top is super silky the only
thing is you definitely will nip through
this if you get cold because it is
double line but since the material is
like almost like silk it's very thin and
I don't know if you guys can see it's
not see-through but you get the idea
it's a halter top design and then the
back fits perfect and it has these three
nice stretch that I like I love strappy
bikinis
I really don't own a light pink bikini
so I'm happy to finally own a light pink
bikini the back is super super strappy
it's kind of like a halter top design
kind of not here are the bottoms they're
super delicate and pretty with the
strappy sides of three strings and this
is full coverage on my but at least
because my butt is small and then
there's padding and it's sewn really
really nice together for the price that
you pay for this one
I love worn pieces but I'm really am
just not a fan of this one I think the
design is really cute but with this suit
you definitely get me pay for as you
guys can see where the pads are please
it's just awkward I don't know if you
guys can see that if anything I would
just cut these out the back lace up is
actually really pretty and flattering on
the body and then the top is a little
big right here on me but I like the
straps and it's really comfortable and
it fits pretty good this is another one
piece I'm not very um happy with just
because the pad placement is so awkward
as you guys can see that right there
honestly I like when one pieces don't
have any padding it's just a double line
bikini is enough for me and then the
back just ties in this I had to tie the
back extra tight just because this part
of the suit is really baggy but the
high-waisted part words connected work
lavador fits me really great and I
honestly love this neutral tone I think
it's really pretty but I probably will
end up wearing this to the beach or
swimming if I happen to wear it probably
just paper photo shoot or something
function photographing this bikini is
really really great just the bottoms
ruined it for me
I need this bikini in size medium
because the bottoms cut in on my skin
like others can see me just holding this
up this is so tiny so unless your twig
this is going to cut in on you major so
I'm either gonna size medium or a size
large the design is so cute I love the
design and honestly it fits great it's
just these cut into my skin which kind
of cuts off the circulation of my legs
um the top is like this you kind of have
to pull these up every once a while
because they fall down
so that it continues to have this strap
eNOS going on up here
this black low-cut one-piece did not
work out for me just because the fabric
was so thin I don't know if you guys can
see me just stretch it this one didn't
work out I'm probably gonna have to wear
it as a bodysuit with normal clothing or
high-waisted jeans um it actually was a
little big on me the back is super open
and revealing you get we paid for with
this bikini and I wish it was double
lined or had some sort of padding in it
to help structure on the body but other
than that I don't recommend getting this
woman this suit is definitely not on my
favorites just because it's not really
me as a person like my style I guess you
could say I love the color blocking
bottoms white and black super cute the
only problem is these cut in into my
skin a lot which I didn't really enjoy
so I just ended up wearing black bottoms
with this and it turned out great if you
really like geometric designs this
students for you and it's really not
that expensive the only thing is there
is heavy padding as you guys can see the
circles outlined in there there's heavy
padding and as holter I like whole
church with no padding I don't know if
that's just me or very little padding
this just makes it seem like my chest is
way bigger than it really is which is
fine I guess you could say but yeah you
get what you pay for with this bikini
and it's actually really great it has an
awesome snap in the back and it fits
around my bust which is like 32 really
great thank you guys so much for keepin
