going to be doing another for lo bikini
collection trying for you guys I thought
this was a really summery video and I'm
trying to do more summery themed videos
for you guys plus bikinis are such a hot
topic in the summer plus these are
affordable I did a video resolve full
within the last two months to a month
and you guys seem to really enjoy that
video so I'm happy to do another one for
you a lot of you said it helped that I
try to on so you can find out what size
you are and stuff like that but I would
love to get in this video if you want to
follow me on any my social media as my
Instagram is at Kelly Kaiser and my
snapchat is Kellyanne but without
further ado here we go just so you guys
know in the beginning of this video I'm
going to be sharing with you my more
favorited bikinis frome's awful and then
towards the end of the video I'm going
to be showing you the ones I wasn't
really impressed with or once it just
weren't really true to size for my body
lately I think one pieces are just so
glamorous so I have this black one piece
that ties around the waist and it's a
really really deep v-neck with an open
back I love this one it kind of gives a
little push up just because there's pads
right here which all these pads are
removable if you don't like the comfort
of a pad that is totally fine I removed
most of them from all these bikinis but
I got this in a size small and it fits
perfect this boot is definitely one of
my favorites just because it is so cute
the white with the gray palm tree design
is really really pretty
also the top fits great this is
definitely true to size the bottoms
could be a little bigger since this is a
size small but what I also really like
is this could definitely be a reversible
white bikini as you guys can see if I
just flip that out because there's no
tags or any seams then make it
seem like you can't wear it reversible I
don't know how I forgot to film myself
talking about this suit but it's
definitely one of my favorites I think
the colors are amazing and I love the
strap eNOS on the back of the bando top
this sue I ordered a size small and it's
true to size this is definitely one my
favorite kinis just because the top and
the bottoms correlates so well together
I know they come together but they just
look nice together also this color right
here is a peachy peachy nude color or
peachy pink color which I really really
like these bottoms are very very
comfortable also they're cheeky which I
really like I like wearing cheeky
bottoms on the beach this top is the
cutest thing ever it also pushes up a
little bit depending on who you are as a
person you might like that I like that
just because I never wear suits of pads
anymore so once I have a suit that
pushes up a little I'm like oh wow
that's nice but I just like the
snakeskin design with this and the back
strings are braided right here and it
just has a racerback design which I
really enjoyed okay so this is totally
scandalous but you cannot tell me that
this is not the sickest suit ever I love
anything that looks like for love and
lemons or super lacing around your chest
area I wore something like this in a
broad light version to Coachella and
everyone calm edgy me on it even though
it was a little scandalous you're still
so fun to wear so yeah this obviously
goes right there I did get this in a
size small and I am in love with this it
fits great and it is so comfortable I
love this bikini so much I got it in two
different colors so this is the first
color I got it in it is almost this is
snakeskin no it's not I feel like it's
just like a cheetah cheetah print who
knows someone could correct me down
below in the comments if you guys are
wanting to but it also has a cool
seashell design of lace embroidery as
the halter I got the synthesized medium
because I read the reviews on this
bikini and they did say to sign up good
thing I did because the small one pet
fit and then here are the bottoms they
just have cool cutouts right here and
the same designs the top and then I have
that an orange as well this fits perfect
it fits like a size small and then here
are those bottoms this bikini is so cute
because it is black with mesh if you
guys could see that these are the most
comfortable bikini bottoms I've ever
worn in my entire life
I don't know why they're so comfortable
what they are they're also the perfect
amount of cheeky I got these in a size
medium when you're looking for the
correct size if you're not looking for
one of these bikinis that I'm showing in
the video you want to read all of the
reviews for every single bikini and then
the girl who ordered that previously
will let you know hey this was not true
to size you should definitely size up or
size down etc etc but also this top was
a little bit big but definitely still
worth it to wear it's just something
that you get with what you pay for if
you're buying an affordable bikini but
the seams are made really great and this
is a really comfortable material this is
one of my favorites as well just because
the top fit really well this is what I
feared as well go a lot I don't even
know how many times I repeated words so
usually people love you know down in the
comments and they're like oh really
really I'm like yeah I really like the
way it's made the seams are sewn
together really nicely the back Criss
crosses and then it just has this silver
clasp that closes and it's pretty secure
to be honest like that and then the
bottoms look like this they're strapped
in both sides I normally wouldn't buy a
suit this color but I mean really
digging this here is another one piece
bikini that I think is just so chic the
back almost looks like you're wearing a
two-piece bikini but then when you turn
it connects near the bellybutton which I
really love I got this in a size small
it fits great
I think it came with pads previously but
I took them out just because I don't
really like pads in bikinis I don't know
why but yeah I got some size small
design is so cute and the colors
photographed really well I don't own a
lot of light pink bikinis but recently
I've been stocking up in my collection
and I got this halter one with
criss-cross in the back and then it just
is like a slinky tie right here it has a
really cool accent of Criss crosses all
up and down the chest which I really
like I got this in a size small I
believe yes I sum all this fits great
I took the pads out and it actually fits
me better without the pads and then
these are the bottoms that come with
this top I wish the bottoms were a
little bit larger for a size small but
definitely still a really good bikini to
work with and it still stretches so they
fit me fine I love anything that color
blocks I thought this suit was really
cute especially because it kind of looks
like a halter top design the back just
has a simple layering of straps no it's
just strappy in the back and it's
strappy on both sides of this do I
definitely think this is reversible with
the pink as you guys can see so you can
definitely wear blue pink pink with blue
whatever your heart feels like and this
fit me great and I got this in a size
small I love this bikini just because it
has white lace embroidery up and down
the body
I do wish it was a smidge bit bigger
depending on your body type I would size
up with this one just because around the
boob area it is kind of exposed but
around the back it is completely
backless which I really really really
like it almost looks like you're wearing
for less than a two-piece but you're not
I swear this is a one-piece bikini and I
got a size small but I wish I got a
medium I have always been a fan of
high-waisted bikini bottoms so I got
this one these fit great if you're
looking for a different color in this
type of bottoms I wouldn't really
recommend
other than black just because the
material is a little bit thin so I would
definitely stay near the black and then
here's the top I actually took the pads
out of the top because it fits me more
comfortable without pads and then since
I took the pad though it's a little
baggy around the boob area but I'm
definitely gonna make it work because I
love the contrast with the stripes and
the black together
here is another one piece it just has
mesh designs up and down the body in the
back it's kind of like that typical
swimmer one-piece design and I got this
in a medium I sized up because in the
reviews they said to I have to say this
might be the brightest bikini I now own
I also have another orange bikini to
share but here are these bottoms they're
definitely full coverage as you guys can
tell these fit great but they're a
little little too much coverage I guess
you could say the top hat pads in it but
I took it out
I love halter top styles because it kind
of makes me look like I have something
going on up here which I really don't
and then the back just has this cute tie
design that goes and this is a
definitely bright orange color I really
really enjoyed this bikini it has just
colorful embroideries up and down the
triangle design as well as on the
bottoms I like how these are pretty
cheeky as well the material is a bit
thin but since the color is so pigmented
you won't have a problem when you go in
the water so it won't be see-through and
then the back is just a normal clasp
like this wrong way there we go I really
like this triangle top because it Criss
crosses in the front like most of my bra
let's I will wear under tank tops or
anything so I'm really really in love
with that also you could switch out the
back straps to crisscross in the back
just because there just will almost like
a Victoria's Secret bra or a strapless
bra that comes with straps you can
detach them and play around with them
and stuff the only problem is with these
bottoms is I don't know if this is
swimsuit material or not but they fit
great they stretch really well I
definitely will still wear these bottoms
with it just the material was really
thin so I was curious about that but the
top is amazing
and if I don't end up wearing these
always pair these with another black
bottoms that I already own I got that
same bikini in white the top is so cute
again the material is still a little
thin so I won't be able to wear the
bottoms for this but I love how Criss
crosses in the front like you guys can
see and again these are detachable and
you can play around with those I don't
know if you guys can see but this is
almost just kind of see-through I use my
head to show you guys how I see through
but I don't know if you could see that I
don't know this I don't think this is
swimsuit material is a bit thin but I
still love the design
I'll just have two parodies with a
different white bottom so I don't really
recommend this bikini and white oh this
has to be my favorite bikini that I
received in this package because it is
this really cool tan color I don't know
if it's right tan um and it has this
honeycomb design Plus this would make me
look tan which I definitely need because
I am so pale and it's summer but I don't
know why I don't get tan but the only
problem is these bottoms are really
really small if you are a really small
person these will definitely fit you I
got this in a size small I would
definitely size up for my body type in a
size large and maybe they might fit the
top is definitely true to size for a
size small it fits great
just the bottoms are not um they're just
really really tiny this is definitely
one of my favorites that I got as well
the only sad thing is this suit is so
small so unless you're really really
tiny this will definitely fit you and I
would love for this suit to fit me but I
even got this in a size medium because
people told me in the reviews to size up
it really is not true to size the
embroidery of the seashells is what I
was so drawn to but I'm so disappointed
because um this just won't fit my body
type personally even though they stretch
a lot I just it's too small for me so I
don't really recommend getting a true to
size for this bikini thank you guys so
