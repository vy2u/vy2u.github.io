of my life with you so here we go so I
am an adult I know I'm 18 I graduated
high school in May of 2014 and I'm like
Gabby right now I took a complete break
in education and that's totally fine I
wasn't ready to go away yet so I needed
time to myself and it's been awesome so
far I love it and I'm constantly busy
for not being in school to be honest
constantly busy I have a full-time job
so I'm always working and then on the
weekends on Saturdays I Drive down to
the city and I have acting classes and
it's amazing Wow it's one of the best
things I've ever done great way to
express yourself hobby career whatever
it's awesome that I learned in that
class is insane and it's marvelous I
love every part of it and then I will
always be up friends or filming or
editing a YouTube video or just enjoy
life I am a one of three sisters yeah
and then I have two parents and they're
amazing but my sisters I have one older
sister who's a sophomore college and
then a younger sister who's a sophomore
in high school I'm the middle child stop

wanted to see us we are a pretty crazy
group of people the kaisers pretty crazy

name is Brody you'll probably see him
the next shot actually meet brownie this
is my doggy

camera down limitless you could see him
um he is really old and he's so deaf
like just these past three months he
went deaf and I don't know it's not
funny
but it's so funny like how weird he is

cute so I love traveling I get it from
my mom my mom traveled very many places
but I love traveling one of my favorite
places that I've ever been was Paris Wow
I love Paris I remember this one moment
where I got out my mom's camera and I
like videotaped me sitting in front of
the Eiffel Tower and it was twinkling
and we were just sitting on the lawn
enjoying ourselves and everyone around
us was just drinking wine and sitting
together and enjoying each other's
company and I remember this one moment
where I just put my headphones in and I
just in took the moment in and it was
amazing yeah we went there with some
good friends of ours after I graduated
high school so I think I went maybe at
the end of beginning of June we went to
Paris and was unbelievable so I love
fashion I think it's one of the coolest
ways to express yourself possible
I love clothing I just think clothing
it's so beautiful such an art form that
sounds so weird to say but I totally
believe that and whatever you're wearing
you're going to be confident if you love
it so yeah movies I love movies oh my
gosh I could rave about movies for so
long but my favorite movie of all time
is probably Perks of Being a Wallflower

then Emma Watson of course because she's
so crazy talented and then what else do

those are some interesting awesome
movies and yeah I love photography
anything to do with photos or posing for
a photo or being in a photo or taking a
photo everything about it is awesome to
me I love every part of it I may not be
the best photographer because I don't
really know everything about a camera or
how to work it for a specific lightning
or something shot but I'm learning music

like the greatest artists or stuff like
that but some people have listened to
