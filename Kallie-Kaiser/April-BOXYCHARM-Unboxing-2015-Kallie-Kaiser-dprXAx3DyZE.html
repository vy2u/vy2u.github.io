brightens up my face I think especially
if the Sun is setting or golden hour
which is my favorite hour of the day
when the Sun is setting this will look
amazing even if you're having a photo
shoot you can even put this on your
color but I believe because it said skin
or body if you face or body of course
skin is humble but I love it oh my gosh

lotion smooth minimal healthy hair with
no frizz pull away well I like
fist/boxing a lot we're smoothing Lucian

floor so the last thing in here is this
duo eye pencil line forest line
okay this is the Vincent Longo I don't
know if I'm pronouncing that Y right

alright so this side is black in the
shape forest and this shade is green in
the shades line my favorite color is
green so I don't really know what I'll
use this lime side for maybe some cool I
look that I'll be doing in the future
the world will never know the future is
a mystery we all know that all right I
actually I like this I mean every girl
needs more than one black eye pencil so
that's nice so this is the vincent longo
eye pencil full-size $26 I think it's
this it's a duo so you get both ends
that's awesome double-sided pencil
featuring to compliment complementary
shades allowing you to create a variety
of eye looks awesome okay guys that is
