thought it'd be so fun to film a makeup
tutorial so for this specific look it is
kind of like that fatty girl bagging
look is what they call them on Instagram
and Tumblr um I would also just say this
look is very Kylie Jenner geared because
we have the eyebrows and they'll got the
lipliner and the wind eyeliner and I put
fake eyelashes on as well um I'm not the
best at makeup so bear with me I just
thought it would be a fun making
tutorial since it's not super popular on
YouTube yet most girls wear Nike or
adidas hats with straight hair with this
look that I decided to rock the French
braids my sister braided my hair for me
because I did not know how to do this to
myself I wish and I will learn one day
my sister also took some photos of me
which I will be putting on my Instagram
so if you want to follow me on there
it's at Calicut and my snapchat is
Kellyanne but without further ado I'd
love to get into this video so you
really so right now I am starting with a
fresh clean face I just have moisturizer
on and I'm starting with Mirabella
primer and I'm just putting this all
over my entire face to use as a good
base so none of my makeup comes off in
this process
once I'm done priming my face I'm taking
the darkest jail shade in this brow bar
from benefit and I'm just putting this
underneath my eyebrow and lightly lining
it after that I'll just fill it in I am
taking my gimme brow from benefit in the
lightest shade and I'm just stroking
this through each of my eyebrows using
my stay don't stray I'm just placing
this on both of my eyelids before I rub
it in for this look we want a sharp cat
eye so I'm going to be taking some
scotch tape and placing this on my lower
lash line in a diagonal direction taking
my morphe brushes 35n palette I'm taking
a lighter shade possible and using this
to mattify the eye primer I previously
placed on my eyes then going in with a
transition shade I'm really just gonna
be building this up with my tapered
blending brush to the desired color that
I want
going with the darker more bronzy
transition shade I'm just gonna be
really smoking that other one out and
really building up the color taking my
small increase brush I'm just going and
putting this on the inner corner on the
upper lash line and then closer near the
crease and then the edge of the tape so
that when we take the tape off it's a
shirt precision edge and like a cab
going in with a crease brush now I'm
going to be building this up on the
outer corner of my upper lash line and
crease
going back with my tapered blending
brush we're just gonna blend all those
pretty colors together taking my
revealed smoky palette I'm taking this
really pretty light shimmery pink shade
and I'm just placing this in my crease
with my tapered blending brush it gives
my eye an extra shine which I really
like using my Stila stay all day the
liquid eyeliner and intense black I'm
just gonna be lightly lining my upper
lash line and then going in for a cat
eye taking this Bobbi Brown gel eyeliner
I'm just going back over the eyeliner
that we just hit with the Stila I
thought that gold sparkles look so
pretty
taking my jar been for che new eyeliner
pencil I'm just putting this on my
waterline and trying to build this in my
inner corner going in with that smaller
crease brush blending black underneath
and really dusting it under the lower
lash line gives a really nice pop to our
eye color for foundation I'm using my
bare minerals bare skin pure brightening
serum foundation in the shade bare
porcelain I have to shake it because it
has coconut oil in it and mix that up
really well I'm just gonna be taking
this on a compact brush and brushing
this all over and blending into my face
using my it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
concealer I am taking and dollop under
each of my eyes and then rubbing that in
in a triangle formation with my finger
lately I have been obsessed with this
Smashbox contour kit the first shade I'm
going to be using is the British shade
in the palette and we're just going to
be setting our under-eye concealer with
that then going in with bronzer I'm
taking this angled bronzing brush and
putting this on both sides of my
cheekbones taking my full flawless
please brush I'm just gonna be dusting
and buffing out the bronzer on both
sides of my face going back into that
Smashbox contour kit I am putting this
on my upper cheekbone and lo where near
my jaw line so it gives the bronzer a
precision of where it's at taking my
pink sapphire highlighter from Oprah
cosmetics and putting this on a smaller
puffy brush and putting this on my
Cupid's bow cheekbones and nose taking
my lightest shade in my morphe palette
I'm just gonna be dusting this on my
brow bone I put these natural looking
lashes on an off-camera and then I
applied this blank amplified mascara on
my upper and lower lash lines
before I go in with a lipliner I always
make sure I have chapstick on so first
I'm using my nice and spicy Mac
long-lasting lip liner and I'm just
gonna kind of over draw the bottom and
then just fill in the top and bottom
going in with my Mac matte
kind of sexy lipstick and I'm just
putting this all over my lips alright
and that is all for a makeup look I hope

super fun I thought it was just a fun
excuse to put on a bunch of makeup I
