actually can't contain my excitement
just because anyone who has known me or
subscribed to me in the past
notice how sexy I am with talking about
bikinis and making a bathing Tube videos
for you guys so however many suits I
have to try on for you guys right here I
purchased some of them some were dated
to me and then I reached out to
companies and their PR or marketing
person with message back and if you like
us we'd love to send you a suit so if it
wasn't for them I wouldn't have such a
wide variety of different styles to
share with you guys and just bring you a
big collection of suits so thank you so
much all those companies I love you guys
and I hope you enjoy this video just for
measurement purposes
I wear 32c in a size bra and around my
hips in inches it is 31 inches and then
around my bust in inches it's 31 as well
so I'm very excited if you would like to
follow me on my Instagram is that Cali
Kaiser it without further ado here we go
also all the dating tips will be linked
down below description box so it's
really easy for you guys to all find
them I'm going to no specific order just
because these are all my favorites and I
have not one best thing to say about any
of these bikinis but the first I'm going
to share with you guys how unreal this
color it is so beautiful so here's a top
I got in a size small and the bottoms on
the side small as well it's similar to
that
ruch material or regice designing as you
could say so the tube top in this front
has this awesome wire design going on in
the chest so you can show some cleavage
if you want and this will look great or
flat-chested or you have bigger boobs it
really doesn't matter there's still good
coverage on the front the entire back is
open beautiful suit to tan in guys and
here's what the bottom look like the
perfect amount of cheapness since
they're cheeky they make my note but
seem like I have a little bit of a bot
going on but I love how strappy the hips
are gorgeous color when I'm wearing this
it's so soft it doesn't even feel like
I'm wearing anything
this shoe I'm about to show you is the
most alluring thing I know and yes I did
look up fitting them bump asaurus
forwards for beautiful because I need
other words to say I got a size extra
small in the top and bottom on this re
oh my is kind of an expense
brand so definitely splurge on this
bathing suit and I hope I fit into it so
the rest of my life it is kind of a
title design if you guys can see is so
comfortable it feels like I'm not
wearing anything
it's high-waisted super high rise Lakes
you look super tall when you're wearing
this if you saw my spring try and
clothing all you've already seen it
actually people get scared
how less their work is right here but it
fits me perfect and also kind of gives
you some sideboob and it gives a little
push up to the booth which is so nice
and it's just awesome white color I came
out which away the Sun spring break I'll
probably take way too many photos on
this one this is from bamboo swim I got
in size small I do not get the bottoms
that come with it so I just wear these
plain Vittori secret bottoms that size
extra small so statutory Siebert doesn't
have baby fits anymore but just one back
is perfect how unreal is this top I saw
this on Instagram and I had to have it
it's so gorgeous and it fits so nicely
it climate of the acts as a wire
underneath your boobs as well so it kind
of pushes them up give them a little
support the back is adjustable with the
straps
I have wanted to own a slate swim bikini
for the longest time ever I'm sure a lot
of you guys fall down on their Instagram
this is the most comfortable material
I've ever put on my body I'm wearing
this and I don't even know I'm wearing
it it's like my dress so it's just a
plain black one-piece with super high
legs going on so I love when anything
makes me taller than I am
Chiki bum entire back is open looks
soaks with it and it's kind of a modern
v-neck design you guys are not going to
believe this just show so stretchy I got
my size small I feel like I could even
fit into an extra small in this this
shoe is amazing almost like they took
highlighter maybe teeny olive and so
obsessed I have a pet velvet Sphinx wind
in my bikini collections and holes
before so I'm just so obsessed with all
of their bikinis and they're with that
company back is just crisscross I got a
size small on the top and bottom it just
was an amazing Sheen so I can't imagine
how good this looks
echolls an hour
that is my favorite time of the day
anyone is watching and the bottoms are
set super simple classic bikini style on
which I love and the butt is gross you
guys have ever seen Bruce very into this
on Instagram they have swim I had no
idea so this is gooseberry seaside this
one suit is amazing I got a size extra
small and I'm not even kidding you this
makes me feel like I have abs when I'm
wearing it it's like an extra layer of
skin just sucking everything and you
guys will see when I try it on for you
so if you don't really like that feeling
I would definitely sign up it's just a
thick material so it's really nice just
what it looks like the bum is cheesy how
aesthetically pleasing is this so this
is from Ocean gem swim Gemma I think
it's the owner of this swim brand and
she is the next human I picked out this
one it is this awesome
red color I would save some closer to a
maroon but it might look brighter on
camera it's just a tube top design I
love it fits so well I got to the size
small and the bottoms are size small as
well you guys can see yes and it also
just has a simple line up sewn going
down to the thumb so it is cheeky which
I love many fans have said that the next
few suits that I have to share with you
guys are all from luscom so thank you so
much to lose that con for sending me
these I am obsessed to the first one I
want to show you guys is this gorgeous
ribbed white one piece and it has lacing
all up and down the sides of your body
the butt is cheeky and it also has gold
hardware that circles that holds the
waist thing as you guys can see it is
super deep v-necks which I love and then
the entire back is opened it's just so
flattering just go look amazing on the
beach I can't wait to photograph in this
how marvelous is this one it just has
white stitching embroidered all up and
down the bikini bottom this one is
cheeky but I will know them obsessive
cheeky so I don't really have to say
that anymore in this video and I got
this in a size small here's what the top
looks like it's just as beautiful it
just has that white stitching
embroidered outerwear and the straps are
adjustable
this suit is from Lulu's calm as well oh
my gosh this one is so afford
I love this mesh or fishnet detailing
whatever you would like to call it and I
normally take the pads out of my bathing
suits but I love pads when it's a halter
top just because it gives it a little
extra roof this is a size small and then
the bottoms are just as do it has that
fishnet or mesh material going on right
along the sides and then just simple tie
I want to say this is closer to a full
coverage look you guys will see in the
trailer in part but I definitely need
that you can make this cheeky depending
on the size of your bootie who doesn't
love reversible one pieces because I'm
obsessed with them this is kind of like
a burnt orange or rusty color I think
it's so amazing I'm trying not to say
the Seymours about all the bathing suits
and then the reversible color kind of
salmon or coral however you like to
describe it I got this in a size small I
believe and it's so flattering this is
from Bondi swim I'm sure you guys
already obsessive it just from looking
at it it is open in the entire back and
this is the first one piece I have that
has side boob fronts absolutely utterly
in love with this design and it's so
comfortable it's really stretchy as well
I think this one is a one size fits all
and it really is very stretchy and it's
super thick and since tutorial or
rivotril I love how comfortable this
looks you guys will see how well it fits
when I try it on and I just love the
navy blue with the cream stripes or so
in I don't people ever go out I love
this is from lolly swimwear so lolly
swimmer has probably been one of my
favorite bikini companies ever I just
love all their styles and their suits
fit me so well and they're really
flyering in my body type so for the
first one I have to share with you guys
this is just a black red triangle top
with very elastic stretchy spaghetti
straps which I love and the bottom are
just as awesome I got this in a size
small for the top and to the bottom so
the bottoms has stretchiness going on to
the elastic size and it is
a rig material with a cheeky bum you
guys will see how gorgeous is fish in
the Trion I'm actually obsessed and
after the second one from Molly swimwear
this one piece is just so flattering the
entire back is open and the spaghetti
strap is that elastic material so it's
really comfortable and it's not heavy on
your shoulders at all it kind of has a
netting on top of the newly material I
thought you could totally wear this
reversible if you're into it but I'm
sticking with the paint
next suit Zulu and Zephyr I have show it
in this bag because it's just so
pleasing and on the back it says made
for the Sun the Salton Sea and love so
another black bikini again you can have
too many black bikinis this is such a
beautiful texture it looks so flattering
on the body I got my in size small for
the top and the bottom what's really
cool about this triangle bikini top is
you tie it in the back and it's kind of
like a paint job which everyone knows
how comfortable it is you guys will see
a close-up of how amazing this material
is it kind of looks like black in foil
just mesh together I was that and then
the bottoms are so comfy they are
similar to other style you've seen this
video so far these are stretchy size
small and I love the little strap on
both sides of the hip
if do is from plaintiff Lu it says blue
eyes because that's their sweat lines I
believe and I have the top in size small
how marvelous is this top in a sequence
covering your boobs and a clasp from the
front in which anyone has a bralette or
bra that class in the front you know how
amazing that comfort ball is let me
think about that here's what I found out
that web services from Planet was there
for light color so the back just Criss
crosses and then the bottom I got this
size extra small they're like this
they're cinched around the bust so it is
cheeky which who doesn't love that and I
like how to be silver hardware or the
gunmetal Hardware you can move this and
adjust the bottoms to your comfort but
this suit is super flattering I felt
like I needed to throw a
- one where we see new years because who
doesn't love triangle swim I think
they're neoprene material it's so
comfortable and so flattering on the
body I got it's like small for the top
and bottom this is the chibi style for
their bottoms I personally would choose
these over the full coverage anyway just
because they are way more flattering on
my body and the top is kind of a white
edging material houses make skin going
on and then it's not reversible but they
did put a thick color on the other side
of it which I really love thank you guys
