excited because it is Spring Break
themed many of you may be on spring
break now depending if you're in college
and you watch this video or during high
school your Spring Break might be at the
end of March but for Spring Break um
right now I'm home in Illinois and I
could not be more excited I still try to
incorporate beach bags for this video
I'm wearing this top from Isabelle's
cabinet and this is my natural hair I'm
so excited next week I'm going to
Antigua for my sister's high school
Spring Break and my mom let me tag along
so I will be taking so many photos on
the island and snapchat stories I'm so
excited if you want to follow me my
Instagram is at Calais Kaiser and my
snapchat is Kellyanne but I would love
to show you guys I have so many bikinis
to share with you guys for this video
because obviously from the title below
you can tell that it is bikinis that I
personally think you should bring on
Spring Break with you or just bikinis
that I absolutely love these are
probably my favorite bikinis I own in
this video so I guess you could say it's
a bikini collection but I'm talking too
much so here we go
snake skin is like the hottest design
this year I don't know what it is it
just is so hot so of course snakeskin
bikinis are also in this bikini is also
named skin and this is literally the
softest bikini material I have ever felt
in my entire entire life it's from in
the clothing I don't know if you guys
know of India or follow them on
Instagram I will be linking down all the
dakinis in this video down below in the
description box so if you guys ask where
anything is from its down there this is
one of the most glamorous bikinis you
can actually wear the top as a tube or
tied like that it has an adorable twist
in the middle which I absolutely love
and I don't know I feel like this Python
print is just like the perfect touch the
bottoms are super cheeky and the sides
are kind of sexy with the like it cut
that makes sense so this bikini has the
most beautiful details it has seashells
tied at the ends of the ties if you guys
can see that it's just so beachy so fun
when you go to the beach you don't
always have to wear the most
conservative bikinis when you're on the
beach you're supposed to be free and
flowy and it's almost pretty much naked
I guess so
this bikini is really great because if
you're going somewhere really hot for
spring break it's awesome because you
barely are wearing anything and it's
super comfortable and it's not going to
come off in the ocean which I love and
it's so stylish and so chic I love this
bikini so much and it is one of the most
comfortable bikinis I've ever owned this
bikini is from Salt swimwear I found
them on Instagram and they have the most
beautiful designs
I feel like this top is what they're
known for because look if you just look
at this top you just see how comfortable
is the back is just effortlessly kind of
like a sports bra so you're never going
to have like whoops I'm in the ocean and
something slips out which is really nice
I love the ties in the front and how
there's like cutouts right under your
boobs
this looks really confusing but it is
the most pretty blush color I love this
so comfortable and the bottoms are
cheeky and just super cute and delicate
and girly which I love and you guys can
see the size are skinny so it's just a
really lightweight bikini that's perfect
for the beach laying out in the sand and
stuff like that I don't think you'll get
too extreme of tan lines so I have this
bikini from lolly swimwear which is all
stripes so it's vertical stripes this
way and horizontal stripes on the ties
which I love this is reversible their
tag is amazing because you could tuck it
in this side tuck it in this side this
is super comfortable there's no extra
padding here but honestly I don't knit
through this to really comfy also
detailing on this there's an ice cream
cone on this side which is so cute and
there's an ice cream sandwich on this
side I mean how cute does that get the
bottoms are reversible as well and
they're cheeky as you guys can see just
super lightweight bikini to wear in the
beach and the ocean um these are
reversible as well as you guys can see
so the tag flips on either side um same
decorations on the ends of the ties
which I absolutely adore just an ice
cream cone and the Ice Cream Sandwich
this one has like a sundae frosty or
whatever they're called ice snow cone
snow cone on here and this one is a
piece of chocolate um I love the design
of this bikini and it's just so fun I
cannot wait to take photos in it so as
you guys can tell these bottoms are
probably the best bottoms you've ever
seen in your entire life they are from
lolly swim as well they are super high
rise super high-waisted super just fun I
love them so much here is the top that
it came with it is the same on either
sides you can basically wear it this way
or wear it this way get the same amount
of fabric on each side and then it just
ties in the middle which it obviously
can be untied and adjusted what is
really awesome this is from wali
swimwear this is from salt swimwear and
you can literally wear them together
they might not be the exact same tan or
blush shape but you can't tell once you
put it on and you are wearing it in the
Sun this mesh white bikini is from
Victoria Secret I recently posted photos
in this on my Instagram when I went to
San Diego I love this bikini so much
anyone that owns it you know why it's
just so comfortable there's no ties or
anything so you just like slide it on on
it super comfy I love the detailing in
the top of the triangle it's just a cut
out of mesh um I'm own this bikini since
last season so I don't think you can get
an on Victoria Secret anymore which is
kind of depressing but I don't know
check on the website and see my famous
tail section but this is the bottoms
it's full coverage yeah these aren't
cheeky on me and then the sides are
really skinny and lightweight this
bikini is from Victoria's Secret as well
and it is reversible reversible bikinis
are my favorite and love anything that's
reversible so it's just this gorgeous
lavender color with awesome tassels on
the front tires and the back ties and
then the other side is a bunch of
squares with a dark deep purple and
they're all white and that has a really
nice like cutout right here so girls
that have more boobage
if that makes sense it kind of will be a
little sexier bikini on you bottoms are
super cool because it has this extra
string that goes around your hips so
when you wear it it's like this and it's
kind of like a huge cutout and then this
is what the other side looks like and it
still has that same gold detailing which
I love to carry on the theme of
Victoria's Secret bikinis these are just
like my basic black bikinis from
Victoria Secret and the reason why I can
you should braving on spring break is
because you can literally wear a black
bikini every single day on spring break
and no one would know you wore it
yesterday
sometimes I just bring like two black
bikinis
if I'm doing like a really quick trip to
California or something when I take
photos and I could post like ten photos
in a black bikini and everyone will
probably think it's a book like a
different black bikini maybe not I don't
know what I'm saying
okay so the first black top that I had
is this gorgeous fringe like tie up top
I love how it's tied right the topic I'd
have it tied right now so you can't
really get full effect
but yeah it's just a simple black
triangle top this says extra small I got
this last year and then I just wear
plain black bottoms these are my
favorite Victoria's Secret bottoms that
you could find there they are the angel
high leg I love them so much they have
that really soft material that's from
Victoria Secret not the pink section
Victoria's Secret you guys know what I'm
talking about
and then this top is the most versatile
black top I own because you could wear
it just like this
or tie it up like this or crisscross
which is my favorite way to wear it I
love it so much but I just wear this
bikini with these plain black bottoms
and it looks so simple and chic
to talk about Aliexpress bikinis
Aliexpress has a really good selection
of bikinis right now I will try and link
down the seller and the stores I bought
all of these from but I'm just gonna
start with this one which is as you guys
can see amazing I got this for 17
dollars and it is kind of like the look
of this kini swimwear company they know
where the top is like 200 and the bottom
is 200 this is literally a replica of
that on Aliexpress for other $20 so I
got in this color and it's just this
amazing crochet design it is just
effortlessly beautiful I love it so much
I got black with yellow red and white
and then there's just blue crochet
lining all around this is going to look
amazing when I photograph in it I'm
really really excited to just like take
photos in this bikini I don't know why I
have another snakeskin bikini to share
with you guys it is a neoprene design
and it's snakeskin so obviously this is
perfect for the ocean because neoprene
makes you stay a little warmer but the
bottoms are full coverage their ties I
love neoprene bikinis and then here is
the top this actually pushes up my boobs
a bit which is kind of crazy because it
doesn't have any additional padding but
it is neoprene sort of thick material it
was under $20 too which is amazing right
this one I'm so so happy with the top as
you guys can see the design is just
super beachy and palm-tree like it's
kind of green and blue white and love
and the bottoms
I don't know they don't fit me right I
have to wear them kind of high up on my
body like this because they cut into my
skin and they kind of like have like I
don't know just doesn't look right
so the bottoms even though I order this
in a size small they're just I don't
know this is my last bikini I got from
Aliexpress it's really really pretty
it's all white with a halter top design
and then there's just a bunch of straps
going across in between connecting the
two like sides at the top and then the
bottoms are cheeky and they have really
really pretty cutouts in them and love
that I love the way these look on and
honestly this is double line so it's not
really see-through I have not worn these
in the water yet so I don't know if you
can see anything when I go in the water
but I think we should be good and I got
this in a size small I feel like so many
people have obsessions with one pieces
right now so of course I have one pieces
to share with you guys it is hard to
find affordable one pieces nasty owls
are like $80 I know about other swimwear
companies that I am obsessed with are
like 115
I found these they're under $40 each
which is amazing
they're from naked clothing and AKD I am
again I'm linking every bikini I own
down below in the description so this
has that amazing tie-up design its
halter which I really love it really
makes me look longer and I and 5/3 I'm
short and then it's kind of high rise
it's not super cheeky or anything it's
almost full coverage and I think one
pieces look amazing
near the ocean if you're taking photos
or anything and then I have this one
which is really deep low-cut and it's
kind of like a mom or like older young
adult design which I love like you look
classy when you wear this even though
it's really low back and really low in
the front the bottom is a bit more
cheeky and I got this in a size small as
well of course we have a triangle
swimwear bikini these
just great neoprene bikinis are great to
wear on the beach personally and I think
they photograph amazing
can we talk about triangle swimmers new
bikini collection they have cheeky
bikinis and they have like full like
they have this bikini and all red like
everything is red and everything is
white and I'm obsessed with it I really
want it but I'm a broke college student
so I can't I can't do it I can't I got
this in a size small and this top is in
a size small I've done so many triangle
reviews that if you need anything to
know about sizing you need to know
anything about sizing um you can look at
my other triangles over reviews I've had
this bikini for about a year now maybe a
little less maybe like 10 months I love
this bikini it's just like super cool so
the bottoms are just like this and
they're cheeky they're very stretchy and
they kind of have this marble purple and
blue design going on it's from ocean gem
swimwear I love it so much I got this
top and a size extra small but since I
grown something I need to size small on
this top really bad but the bottoms are
a size extra small neck fit like a small
