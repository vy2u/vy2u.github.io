gosh I'm so excited because I am
bringing you my summer bikini collection
I have wanted to film a try on haul for
my summer bikini collection for the
longest time ever and I'm finally able
to share these pieces with you guys I
think this is the ultimate bikini
collection for the summer
I think these suits are the best I have
some one pieces and two pieces to share
with you I don't want this intro to be
long so here we go to kick off the start
of this video I want to share this
amazing two-piece with you I love
anything that you can wear multiple ways
this talk you can wear two different
ways so the first way is like this and
then this bar just sits across your
chest right here it is so flattering and
then when you don't want that you just
pull it up and wear like a normal
two-piece triangle string top which I
love this color blocking is giving me
life I think it's so pretty
also if you have a really nice tan
you're very lucky because I'm so pale
and then these bottoms are more of a
hipster full coverage style but since
they're a seamless so they ride up a
little and they make them cheeky on me
which I love I love cheeky bottoms this
is my small and this is the brand Kyani
swimwear I will leave a link down below
in description box for all of these
suits that I have a line that I've
gotten online for you so the only easy
access to finding them as well and then
of course I just have a classic black
bikini to share with you guys this isn't
a size small and it is from the company
velvet syncs I love their name I think
it's so cute can we talk about how
strappy this top is it's crisscross in
the back and in the front is just so
strappy up and down your chest I love
that I think it's so cool and then the
bottoms are just a strappy and fun
these are the size small as well there's
just three strings on the hips but
they're tangled
and then the back is super cheeky which
I love I love anything that super cheeky
I also am NOT going to get weird tan
lines in this because I am so pale as
you guys can see I actually just wear
sunscreen and I don't get tan lines I
also never the girl laying out I am
always in the water swimming so if I get
any color it's always because I'm
swimming so that is why I like to wear
with a strappy bikinis the next suit is
from velvet Sphinx as well oh my gosh
the zoo is amazing it is a wooden design
the bottoms look like this and they're a
bit cheeky but they're more coal cover
so the other one on me I love this this
Kalu so good if you have a tan Wow
and then here's the top to that side
small as well I really like the thick
bandage that goes around the back
because I did wear this in the water
already and nothing falls out it doesn't
move this too once it's on you it does
not move it's super sturdy lolly
swimwear is one of my favorites when
we're companies ever I just love how fun
and colourful all of their suits are so
the first suit I have to talk about is
this I think it's their babe top design
I love these colors these look really
good if you have a tan as well obviously
I don't right now and in the back ties
like that and it's not cuffed when it
does have an underwire which is actually
very supportive and then the bottoms are
cheeky and they look like this these are
reversible so you could totally have
this burnt brown color which I love or
these really pretty florals florals
really pretty floral designs and then
they just tie on the sides
this suit is amazing so here the bottoms
they're just so fun they're more of that
hipster design and then there's like
this little kind back and they are
cheeky these are also reversible which I
love if people flip if I can alright I
got these in a size small into the top
it's so beautiful I think it's so
flattering so the back looks like this
this suit is very very comfortable and
then it ties and
just gonna put this on pretty good its
highs in the front like this you guys
can see I feel like you can't see the
full design when you hold it up in front
of the camera but you'll see when I try
it on for you
and it just ties like this and it is
reversible as well I have been loving
one pieces lately so I have a few one
pieces share with you guys so this one
is from else wins it is a beautiful blue
grayish high design with some white
accents it ties up on your shoulders
right here which i think is so cute
the back is super low the cheeky bum is
even better and also this makes your
legs look longer because it kind of has
a high hip right here I got this in a
size small and the v-neck design is
super cute I love this and then this one
is from into clothing inside out this
one's from inter clothing I actually got
this on dolls kill calm on sale it was
so expensive before and I think I got it
more than half off which is so amazing I
love how it's reversible so you can wear
as a body suit in as a swimsuit which is
really cool I've worn it as Bowl already
this is a size small the back the
bottoms the bottoms are super cheeky as
you can see so this is the lacy design
in the front and then if you flip it it
has kind of that black sheen swimsuit
material this one is from into clothing
as well it is from their actual website
though I think this suits so beautiful
and so flattering on the body the
crochet is amazing I actually barely own
any crochet suits this has definitely
got to be my only one I love the
off-white color also this is a really
pretty like red with a deep V and then
the racerback looks so cool
it is a little cheeky but it could be
full coverage depending on how big your
butt is and then you could reverse it
and wear it um
as a white color as well just super cool
love it and is so flattering on the body
I love suits that color-block so I had
to get this one this one is from the
company pull and bear so when I was in
Spain I picked this up I think it's so
cute it also looks really good if you
have a tan obviously I don't right now
I'm trying to work on that and then the
top is just a simple triangle design
like this and then you can also reverse
it and wear it this way which i think is
really cool these just look really bring
it together and I can't wait to hear
more
this dude is from the brand de Lena's
bikinis this is another staple in my
bikini collection I love this suit I've
worn in more than a few times especially
in the water it looks so good next to
sand because there's this nude and mesh
material right here and then the bottoms
are that full cup from full coverage
these are not full coverage because are
very cheeky which I really like and then
the design of it and more hipster design
which I really like as well
I also have another basic to share with
you guys this one is just a plain white
one from ocean gem swimwear my sister is
such a butt and I don't have the bottom
to share with you guys for this suit
because she took them to Europe with her
she's actually studying abroad in
Barcelona right now and I don't have
them to share with you guys on camera
but I just add sugar soo because I love
ocean gym swimwear they have amazing
suit
and you're looking for something super
fun or just super basic like this also
this is padded and it pushes up your
boobs really really nice I also have
some triangle swimwear seats to share
with you guys this one has been so
highly requested to review but I didn't
actually one make a small video about it
so I wanted to include it in my bikini
collection the buttons are size extra
small I love them they fit great I'm
obsessed with their new Chiki bum I
think it is a great great look also know
the floral design is super fun and I
normally never go for floral the top is
so pretty it is that forest green olive
color but also has a sheen to it if you
guys can see like a highlighter would on
a face um this one's on the size small
the straps are adjustable and they fit
grades I love swimming in these suits
and then I got these bottoms in a size
small because I didn't want to keep
sizing down plus I'm still growing so I
just wanted to size up they both fit me
great though there's really no super
different pickle fit me really really
great size small or extra small and then
this top and this is in a size small as
well I am in love also I had no idea
this was a denim finish and then the
embroidery of like the flowers are so
sick these look so good together and I
can't wait to photograph in this sooo it
it's going to look really cool also that
bag is really cool that it came with
it's like that denim finish again but I
think it's still neoprene obviously and
then the flowers at the bottom art is so
sick I love it thank you guys so much

honestly had so much fun making this
