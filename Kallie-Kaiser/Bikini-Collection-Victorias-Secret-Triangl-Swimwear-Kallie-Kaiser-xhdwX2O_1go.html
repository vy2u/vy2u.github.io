to be sharing with you my bikini
collection I'm not going to show you
every single bikini that I own because
I'm gonna be seeing some heinous bikinis
from six and seventh grade no I wanted
to see those also they don't fit me
anymore but yeah I'm so excited also I
have a promo code for today for swimwear
one of the best swimmer companies I've
seen um they have a free shipping code
beach bum beach bum is a free shipping
that they never have promo codes nor
coupons so this is huge free shipping
used to code beach bum they also have
some neoprene bikinis if you're looking
for something $20 cheaper 20 dollars
cheaper than triangle swimwear I highly
recommend buying it from them they have
like triangle tops and neoprene bikinis
that look just like triangles and
they're amazing um yes you use a good
beach bum also I am so excited to share
my bikinis with you guys so here were
you this bikini is fairly new it has a
scalloped design on the top triangle
it's so new I haven't been able to wear
it in the water yet but I will be
bringing it to spring break can't wait
and then the bottoms have that same
scalloped design this is from pink so
Victoria Secret pink same thing very
similar at least the scallop goes all
the way around the entire bikini bottom
and then the bum is cheeky it's so cute
and you guys have to consider that I
have no butt at all just flat booty so
these are okay this bikini is very new I
got a Victoria Secret it just shipped in
the mail very recently um and as you
guys can tell the fringe is so cute it's
like a sanded ivory color and look how
cute the fringes and then there's these
tassels with gold beading the back is
not adjustable just a triangle style
okay the bottoms are super cheeky but I
have no but I don't know how many times
I have to say that in this video because
I like cheeky bikini bottoms I'm a beach
girl and I don't know I have this super
bizarre awesome
jungle design like a bikini from
Victoria's Secret and the back is a
racerback
so this is so comfortable and
just very light padding triangle design
I love how bright the colors are it's
just a fun bikini to have so I have a
high-waisted bikini these are the
bottoms I don't know if you can see the
lighting but these are actually mesh
lime detailing on the sides and then the
top is you guys could tell it is just
like a cupped top and there's lining
across here mesh and then the top is
kind of like a seashell design I thought
this bikini was so cute and it's from
Victoria's Secret this is probably one
of my favorite bikinis it's fairly new
but it's a really cool material from the
toy secret and then the sides are cut
out it's kind of risque not going to lie
um and then the bum is cheeky and then
the top is crisscross design it goes
like this
I don't know hopefully I put a picture
in right here where you guys could see
what the top looks like I just love the
structure of it and the way it looks my
torte makes my torso look longer than it
really is and then I have this bikini
it's so cute is reversible from
Victoria's Secret
it is halter top inspired so the front
is like a coral I don't know what design
that is and then blue cheetah on this
side I like wearing it the top blue
cheetah and then the bottoms are cheeky
and I like to wear them the palm-tree
way and then they just have these like
cool tassels with these neon pink beads
they're coral beads and you could
literally wear whatever side you want
I love reversible bikinis then I have
this very plain triangle top from
Victoria's Secret it's this gorgeous
blue purple color or this is just
completely blue I consider this like
purple blue purple and then the bottoms
are just the traditional Victoria Secret
style bikini bottoms I love this bikini
it has a tie in the front it's just want
to pack that's so simple I have this
white bikini from Nasty Gal it's so cute
um it's kind of risque but I love it
it's okay to wear on the beach the back
is crisscross the triangle tops are a
little small and then the bottoms are
cheeky and heck
on the side it's just such a fun bikini
I love it this bikini is from Nasty Gal
it's just this cute plain triangle top
with mesh detailing in the Triangle
design I love that and then the bottoms
are very simple as well it's just a
string bikini on the sides and then
there's that mesh design on the top so
it matches and I have this super bright
I still love this bikini I don't know if
it's a lot of style but it's that basic
push-up bikini top from Victoria Secret
and then the bottoms are from pink
they're cheeky and then on the front
they're cinched as well there's a super
cute floral neon pattern I love the
green eye these don't actually go
together but I made them go together
when I purchased them this is probably
one of my favorite bikinis as it's so
tied together it's just a purple color
like a grape dark purple color
it's string and it's the most basic
bikini that I own just string travel
bikini it's so nice because you could
just crumple it up take it anywhere with
you and you have a bikini with you I
love that then I have this style banjo
bikini it's just a fun summer
tie-dye bikini and then this bottoms are
side ties from Victoria's Secret from
Victoria's Secret most my bikinis are
from Victoria's Secret so if I forgot to
say something's from Victoria's Secret
it's probably from Victoria's Secret so
I recently got this bikini top on sale
at Victoria's Secret for $10 and it was
such a cool design I love the mesh
detailing and then the pattern was
floral I don't usually go for floral but
it was black and white so I had to get
it the next is a halter top it has cool
designing on it this was kind of sporty
so I liked it
I didn't buy matching bottoms with it
because I have just plain black bottoms
yeah it just hooks in the back and it
looks really nice on the body so these
are the old style Victoria's Secret tops
and they used to put like seashells and
glitter and beading all over them I love
those designs so I'm so happy this
bikini is still in such good shape for
how old it is this is probably six years
old or five this was before I was in
high school love them and then there's
this long with the silver on it this
one's kind of
style I don't know if I would still wear
this but I definitely still wear this
one I know it these were my first um
cheeky bikini bottoms I think I've ever
purchased about two years ago and they
have this black and white stripe design
on the side they're grippy and then the
butt is cheeky and there's hot pink I am
NOT a fan of the club pink but my nails
I think right now um but I liked pink
bikinis
I loved pink bikinis so I went through a
phase where I bought a lot of black
bikini tops and a lot of black bikini
bottoms so that I can mix them and wear
whatever I wanted so for the bikini
black tops I just have this push-up one
I don't know if this still fits me it's
kind of smalls when I was like a 32a but
and it was just a cool design kind of
like 50 sounds buyers that halter
push-up top and then what girl doesn't
have this bikini let's be honest um this
is just that traditional white and black
um push of a tray secret top everyone
else has it like neon colors I have it
in me on color too come on I'm not
ashamed every girl has this beauty and
then I have this cute halter one pushup
and then the black buckle on the back I
love this one I still wear it
I sometimes wear it with these bottoms
they look super cute together
and then this is probably my favorite
black top that I own because it's just
so simple and it's that halter push-up
style with the black and then there's a
tie on the front and then for some
bottoms that I have better black I just
have these thick hipster side bottoms
like this and then the bum is cheeky and
then I have this one where the sides are
kind of revealing but it has a cool
jungle flowers on the side right here
and then I just have the most
traditional black bikini bottom from
Victoria's Secret that you could
possibly get and then I have a lot of
triangle swimwear bikinis so if you
really want to see all of my triangle
swimmer bikinis I will link my triangle
swimwear review video down below in
description box and you could check that

swimwear bikini and I got this in a size
small for the top and then the bottoms

I have this one and it's just the
traditional Cloe triangle top design
bikini and the bottoms are here size
small for the top extra small for the
bottoms I love this bikinis probably one
of my favorite ones as well and then I
have this really Firefly one I don't
think they sell this one on the website
anymore which is a bummer because it's
one of the most beautiful bikinis I
think that they could have sold
um it's just a fishnet top and the
straps aren't adjustable because the
style is old
