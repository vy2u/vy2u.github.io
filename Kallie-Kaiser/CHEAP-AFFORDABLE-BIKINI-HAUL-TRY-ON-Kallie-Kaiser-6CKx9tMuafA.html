I'm going to be filming an affordable
bikini collection these are all from za
lands awful did send me be serious I'm
sure you've seen them with other
youtubers videos I've actually done two
videos also in the past and a lot of you
guys really wanted me to do another
affordable bikini collection so here we
are and don't worry I am still uploading
my spring break bikini video it's just
I'm uploading this one first and then
that one will come next week but I'm so
excited
I love bathing suits anyone who's been
on my channel before but I have quite a
bit and array of colors to share with
you guys and I'm really excited to get
in this video and if you want to follow
me my Instagram is that Cali Kaiser but
without further ado I will be showing
you my favorites in the first half of
the video and then my least favorites at
the very end of the video so keep an eye
out for that but here we go having a
plain black bikini in your wardrobe is
such a must so if you don't have one or
know what you're doing but you
definitely should get your hands on one
I'm showing this one of the video first
because it is my new favorite bathing
student oh my gosh I'm obsessed I didn't
leave the pageant in this one and it's
actually really soft material for being
such a cheap bathing suit and it has
these cute little sleeves that extend
off the shoulders and they just hang out
on your arms so cute and then I like to
take these straps like handles like you
would tie it as almost there but I
actually bring it down and I tie them
around my waist and it looks really good
as a strappy effect and then the bottoms
are size small as well they do just have
a skinny strap along both sides of your
hips these are very true to size as well
I love these I won't go any cheap years
and this personally but if you want to
go cheering on this we have cheesier
ones coming so keep on watching red has
been one of my favorite colors to wear
lately so I've been purchasing a lot of
red clothes I love this cop I did leave
the pad in this one as well this one
probably gets me the best out of all the
suits I received this is Anna Skye small
as well and they just have this mitt
material on top of the normal slim
material and the back just looks like
this it's just a really simple strap
design and the bottoms are cute as well
they're kind of like the first black
bottoms I showed you guys it's just
strap along the hips and then this one's
cheeky too but it's like a really good
amount of cheeky and this has some
material on the front as well this one's
really comfortable and it kind of adds
some support if you're looking for that
which I love it
this shoe is so flattering I read the
reviews and it says to sign up so I got
mine in the size medium and it's just
this awesome camel or caramel color I
love this color I think looks really
raised any one skin tone and then the
bottoms just look like this
there's strappy on the sides and they
have a braided design which I love and
these are really comfortable and they
are the perfect amount of cheeking the
back this shoe is made really really
well and it's definitely one of my
favorites I'm sorry master Kelly I'm
afraid I can't do that yeah I am sorry
call me master Kali and I think this
suit is so fun I love the design I so
badly want one of these horns just
perfectly placed above my bed up there
this is in the size small it fits me
perfect
this material is super soft and it is a
bit stretchy I when I'm looking for
sizes are thoughtful I read all of the
reviews from the bikini and a while ago
actually upload photos in the bikini or
if you go to their Instagram and then
was awful tagged in a lot of the girls
that it purchased bikini tagged in the
photo and then you could creep on them
but to continue on with the hall I'm
obsessed with this top as well I left
the pageant and this is because it
personally looks better with the past
it's a little nippy without the pads if
you know what I need this color is
absolutely amazing it is a dark forest
green color and this suit is velvet I've
never owned a velvet suit so so happy to
have my hands on one now this is just a
nice zucchini for how cheap it is also
the straps are adjustable in the back
which yes love adjustable straps and the
bottom they're really Givi look at that
real cheesy so if you're comfortable
with showing your bum off like that
please go ahead flaunt it I love it
so we'll see if my comfort level will
extend to the beach in this bathing suit
but for now and you'll see me wearing
this around the house or to tan in this
is a great suit to tannin oh my gosh so
such a good one and then I got that in
another bomb color this is kind of like
a burnt orange this is in a size small
as well you guys will see in the try on
how good it looks
out of set just the most beautiful color
and very pale right now also good so if
I did have a tan I'm sure this would
look really great
it's velvet as well and then here's what
the bottoms look like I just wish they
were a little bit more full coverage
this suit is so fun it has mesh paneling
cut out squares I don't know what you
would call this but it just has a nude
background with cut out squares I love
this in the size small the bottoms are a
little bit tight on me and for the top
it looks like this it's kind of like a
sports bra design and then this batch is
Criss crosses and they do have
adjustable straps which is really nice
and I just love this suit it's really
really cool designs kind of modern
looking and then I have another plain
black bikini to share with you guys this
one is a great design also I love the
two strap design going along on the
shoulders it looks really good you're
ticking ticks on the beach we're fast
but I love this to see the size small as
well it's a little tight on my bra strap
area right here you guys will see when I
try it on and then the bottoms are just
plain ties these are full coverage which
is nice if you don't want anything
cheeky I person with cheeky more than
full coverage just read an eye only on a
butt but string bikinis great staple in
your wardrobe as well these bottoms are
everything I think they are so
flattering they already perfect and I'll
even though they're full coverage they
kind of slide up your bum a little bit
so they kind of go cheeky naturally
since they are a seamless look but I am
obsessed with this design so pretty and
there's really stretchy I didn't - I
small and they stay it's so true to size
for my body and it is what the top looks
like I'm pretty sure these already
the same design link does it look the
same I can't tell the top is cool
because that two braids for the shoulder
straps and I love it just looks like
this there's not much to say about it
but there's so much to say about the
bottoms I love these so much ever since
I was in high school I have been drawn
to this pattern my entire life I don't
know why I think it's because my
favorite color is green but I love this
it's like a palm tree or a leaf design
however you would want to say it and
then on the sides it just has like
ladder or like a panel design all up and
down you can see your skin through it
looks really pretty this dude comes with
this did come with pads but I decided to
take them out just because I like when
suits generally have pads I think it's
more flattering and I got this in the
sights and all this fits me it's perfect
and the thumb is a little bit cheeky as
well okay these are the one that I
really like so to talk about this guy I
think well I read the reviews and it
said to sign up so I doubt size mediums
but I don't even know if the small would
fit me right it's just real awkward like
body you guys will see so this looks
like this I just the pads out because
they were way too extra and I love extra
but they were more than extra so here's
what the body suit looks like or it's a
one-piece is what I should say I love
the design but since hate is a strong
word I really just like this one it
looks like a wardrobe malfunction when
you're wearing it so I definitely don't
recommend buying this one unless you
like the way it looks so yeah and this
color is so beautiful but these bottoms
are so small and a size small and these
are not true to size they squeeze my
butt cheeks and make them look so scary
you guys will see and then for the top
the top even isn't really that bad I
think it's just too full coverage for me
I'm really used to wearing smaller
bikini top just because I like that
style here's what the top looks like
it's actually really cute and it does
look flattering on but when you pair it
with me it's just too much fabric on my
body since I do have a shorter torso I
you love this one by disliked it at the
same time if that makes sense
this one I'm still upset about because I
totally ordered it in the wrong size in
the reviews it said to size up as well
so I sized up and I got a medium in this
one but it's just too large for me which
it's such a pretty bikini I love it I
know friends that have this one from is
awful and they love it and it has a
zipper which is so fun and flattering
and I love black one pieces like I think
it is such a staple even more than a
two-piece bikini but you guys will see
the try on how this one set just looks
like this I do wish it was more cut
higher up on the hips because it likes
makes my legs look longer and I love all
my legs look longer but that is all the
bikinis I hope you guys loved this video
comment down below which one with your
face and keep an eye out for my next 15
video that I will be uploading next week
I love you guys thanks to is awful for
sending me all these bikini is really
nice and I know a lot of people have had
problems with shipping or ordering comes
off in the past I have never had
problems resolved on the past I did
order stuff from them before I started
YouTube and I think it took about three
weeks to ship to me which is normal
sensation from China but I haven't had
shipping from them when they ship to me
these suits it only took four days so
quick but I love you guys
I'm happy to answer any questions or
concerns about the offal ramble on the
search box and love you all have a
lovely day I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
