Lolo here with me hi Lola I live
together also she's one of my best
friends in case you guys haven't seen
her in any videos or vlogs before but
we're really excited cuz we're filming
and you're ready video is mean we just
did our makeup on camera I'm going to
see on this question but I asked you
guys to ask us on my phone so without
further ado I would love to show you
guys our makeup looks and here we go
okay priorities name is the YSL Touche
Eclat blue primer wait I need to know
this was a blur primer that's okay if
you like whenever I use primer I use a
little bit like I use in that for my
whole face but I don't use like Thompson
Thompson primer deal
did I just do to help yeah so what's
that favourite thing about Lu
we've also down you will their email
University so it's your thing with all
of you honestly the people in the campus
they're so themselves it's crazy yeah
and we love everybody there yeah like
everyone that I've met there is amazing
but I also feel like I mean we're just
so lucky to go there and like the campus
is beautiful if any one of you are doing
sitting yet oh my gosh it's great lay
off for the class they're like we don't
go here right this is a joke no it's so
beautiful and I just think there's like
so many of a school's out here that are
a lot bigger but I love the size of all
of you
oh honey you use this power before
because it is a little goes a long way
oh yeah holy crap yeah a little does but
only but it's great people to dry skin
yeah um you have to ask what's your
favorite designer brand I like Gucci I
like Gucci - but there's totally a more
iconic one that I can't think
what dependence because like if it's
jewelry earth and yeah it totally didn't
change like what designer you like but I
love Gucci so what is our favorite type
of work out there in that workout where
you will start working out and I will be
motivated at my leg at one point it's
just not right now
yeah it's not right now I've done like
soul cycles which I love just really
quick worries oh yeah love these too
faced chocolate brownies they sent they
also asked how do we stay motivated and
confident do you want a separate
question yeah to stay motivated feelings
everywhere I surround myself with yeah
you are a neurotic yeah how is it clean
person so actually I am and when I'm
doing homework you tend to do that so
yeah oh yeah anytime believe I call each
other each other and kind of where I put
my energy into because I work and away
with Emily Z for a week and then I can
you really grimy for a week
yeah I'm not lazy one day and then crazy
active and not cross mating and anything
I think the best way to stay motivated
like whether it be school or work or
different things that you have going on
I think the more organized you are
almost the more motivated you can be if
you just I mean it's your mindset always
like it you go into things
negative you're obviously not gonna be
motivated so it's best to just think
what's the best outcome of this
situation that is so yummy okay are
youse repubiic oh yes sorry losing today
I have quite a bye
we're going to eat the same
this is the new toothpaste peach perfect
comfort and app this is an app
foundation okay so I did six pumps on my
hand recommend it
what do you like most about YouTube you
can answer this - do you want to go
first
um cuz you walk you to - yeah okay first
look how he's videos like you guys I sit
in bed right there
and what but I think just seeing people
be able to express their creativity is
really cool living with the youtuber is
very cool just the fact that I get to
see what Cali loves to do and she's so
good at it but you are so sweet I never
thought I would be able to connect with
so many people across the world in this
yeah yeah I'm so awkward I was just on a
weekend there with Duke shopping I love
Duke shopping shout out to them but
these girls that are on this trip were
so amazing
it was so cool to see every single girl
in that house was so different but we
all did YouTube mm-hmm and you love that
oh this is perfect because we're Deniz
how did you two meet what something your
roommate does that makes you crazy
oh my gosh it's gonna be amazing what we
met through a mutual friend yes
the same school for Cali transfer but we
never knew each other I didn't know each
other so we agreed out together and then
I met her when we moved in last outing
friends - yesterday we had Sophie mutual
friends and it's so funny that we didn't
even meet each other because I feel like
after living together even for just a
year and knowing each other that we
didn't know each other
yeah she doesn't feel like we just met a
year ago mine for Maui is this girl I
will be like we'll be doing something
out I'll have we'll be talking if she's
on the couch like we're both sitting
here I'll go to my room to grab
something and then come out and I've
been talking to her this whole time and
she's fully not I'm holy anywhere
anywhere whatever we're talking about
like she will fall asleep I know it
drives me crazy about Lawrence she has
to leave two hours before anything and
I'm like the type of person like that
only leaves like 10 minutes before and
be somewhere and it takes 20 minutes to
get there and I'm dying I was I like go
this early in Cali is like I am the most
punctual person if I say I'm gonna be
somewhere out of time it will stretch me
out the whole day and ruin my day if I'm
late and I think I was trying to do 15
things in drop an hour okay next
question what are your plans post-grad
you can go first through this one oh I'm
using the Too Faced unicorn tears
mystical bronzer because
if a glowing unicorn in the middle of
the bronzer um for bronzer I used Mac
Studio Fix and I'm using the Becca
cosmetics palette with Chrissy Teigen
their collaboration is really good we
live in LA so I think I'm gonna continue
living here I'm from the Bay Area from
San Francisco so I don't think that I
would go back home just because it's
very different there it's a little bit
slower and so what I want to do it I
love LA and love living out here so
we're back in LA there's no way yeah
there's no way we need to leave anytime
soon yeah I'll stay out here to own a
graduate and working and hopefully event
planning and PR public relations so I
study communication studies now and
hopefully YouTube I don't know what kind
of direction it will go within the next
few years but I'm sure also be able to
communicate on this platform and I hope
to still use it then but yeah I really
wanna mostly focus on my granting and
kind of my identity and moving kind of
towards maybe building a brand where I'm
able to have my subscribers before
something I design or create or
prettiest to say which you're totally
gonna do which I want to do and she's
going to you need to do the same thing
where each other's number ones support
it's time all my friends that I met out
here in LA I'll just I own you they are
honestly such amazing people and we all
just take each other up and oh yeah I
we've never just it was supported okay
what are your priorities and goals on
life well then so crazy how much your
priorities changed every six months they
change
being happy whatever I'm doing and yeah
however I'm feeling and knowing that
however I'm in life right now I'm happy
and it is enough yeah yeah
my priorities I think what you said just
about being happy and what you're doing
and kind of just taking everything as
like a growing experience and learning
experience because it's really hard to
be able to accept things or move on or
like do whatever you need to do if
you're stuck in the past or stuck with
like looking at the future too much even
holes on life is just too honestly be
happy whatever it is that you're doing
being happy with who you surround
yourself with being happy in your
relationships and honestly I mean you
will never get what you want in life
unless you don't ask for it yeah I don't
have just like the older I get I feel
like I'm better at being more aggressive
and um yeah I don't know behind anymore
what you see but it's crazy you're
honest yes just honest your eyes man
using me Sephora Pro and I think I'm
going to use that too
okay highlighter is ours it is the NARS
Capri oh my gosh this is gorgeous
it matches my skin tone perfectly if
you're like my complexion or lighter or
darker or whatever you want to use it
for these are great because they don't
like some highlighters on me can look
not so great and photos are with flash
or whatever but these ones I feel like
look on it right
yeah so this one there Callie Amy both
but this one is st. Barts and then this
one is double take and I just make sense
of what is your ideal perfect day outfit
this is I personally love dressing in
bougie sweatpants yeah so I wear some
pants every single day I mean right now
we actually kind of got dressed for
today and you can went out and about but
since we are college students I feel
like my everyday style is sweatpants or
a really dope sweatshirt with cool
leggings and sneakers Air Force Ones
every day my ideal outfit yeah something
like what I hang on to the tank or a
t-shirt with a really good pair of jeans
like the jeans they're key to without
fit so you have to have a good pair of
jeans always and I left them a long time
like I'll wear that for you know where
that's like but in LA um Reformation
vintage picks out amazing denim that
time wasted and economic back 120
dollars for a pair which could be really
expensive dependent really expensive
depending on your age but they are
amazing jeans and we love the fit on
average how many times per day do you
see each other naked I feel like I live
with some of them you see me get hold of
time
I'm terrified
what is our honest opinion about
Coachella and I'm going to give a
question I love you too
and this is a great question because
Coachella was a little bit weird this
year you know we haven't I feel like you
change it yeah amazing time nothing to
really complain about other than the
fact I wanted to go home by 10:00 p.m.
every night yeah it's like if we do it
you need to do it VIP yeah I have mixed
views on Coachella because I think
expectation versus reality is such a
thing with it like no one tells you it
is a height I'm just like the outfit
preparation you really don't over it no
teacher in jeans and look unreal yeah we
ended up in how to use by the end of the
night which was every image oh yeah we
were coming and yeah I think Coachella
is hyped but I think everyone should go
at some point I mean everyone who lease
on is fully worth it like I said yup
Beyonce and when I was in a Turner Tyler
the Creator seagulls I've never seen
someone so creative on stage hope Tyler
yeah his look the way he showed up what
we sing together like this my should
justify this ready thank you this
question applies to us so much but it's
what is the craziest and/or funniest
story you you've encountered together
craziest or funniest this is so so funny
because I there's so many to pick from
what happened to us the other day and we
were
if someone else is here no one would
believe out I didn't know that would
happen there was these girls breaking
into love their outfits but if we were
to tell this situation they good you're
kidding but they were fully breaking
into a building this um and these people
are sliding in like this into the hole
like ninjas in this February and we on
green my way way with an all-black
jumpsuit and just green outline randomly
and then what was the girl in the pink
wig wearing but they were asking things
to each other and then breaking in you
just see their bodies slide through this
really small and I'm like what it way
then Lauren literally goes see people
kind of little Chanel duo so so this is
the rude allure 91 shade and I don't
fill in all the way I just dab it like
the Queen she is and then I only put lip
gloss on the bottom half because it gets
kind of full coverage thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch this video
I hope you loved it
thank you Lolo for being in my video
pour down on all the creams to read like
down below for you guys but we have a
lot of fun filming this and hopefully we
