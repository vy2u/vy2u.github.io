finally filming my closet to refer you
guys i'm so beyond excited a lot of you
guys have questions about how I spent my
large wardrobe into a one-bedroom
one-bath apartment that I also share
with my roommate so we do split two
closets this one is not a walk-in and it
just has these mirror sliding doors and
then the one right next to me is a
walk-in closet and you guys will see it
in a sec but this videos been so
requested it to the other side to get it
out there for you guys and hopefully you
take some tips I'll have a link down
below in description box for anything I
kind of try to learn for you or show you
hands-on if you want to follow me on my
Instagram is that kind of tiger so
without further ado here we go in my
first closet here I just hang up old my
jackets or like host I don't really
organize this in a specific way but one
of my recently new purchases of a denim
jacket how balm is this
it just has these silver studs all over
it from car bar denim I could get it at
the lf7 like on the fifty bucks
you can totally thrift a denim jacket
and create this exact look I do have a
new denim DIY video coming out within
the next month so look out for that but
I am just obsessed at this I got inside
small but is an oversized fit it just
looks really great layered with anything
and then my newest investment that I'm
just really proud about I recently
picked up this leather jacket from All
Saints the hardware on it is amazing
it is real leather so anyone who's
against that I'm sorry but I did
purchase a real leather jacket there has
black Hardware on it so it's really nice
because the top doesn't take away from
your jewelry or your face which i think
is awesome and loving it looks really
great layers anything and it also is
really warm and I also just kind of have
random bombers in here Justin also on my
new favorite thing it's just this straw
swing breaker how amazing I got on golf
kill and then up here I keep all of my
amazing oversized sweater
I recently followed them so they
obviously don't look this perfect all
the time my newest purchases are
probably my favorite is the shadow
pillow sweatshirt I'm obsessed with them
they are so amazing I love them they're
so comfortable I do order size medium
anyone is wondering over here I hang up
a lot of my skirts or nice shorts I have
a Coachella look book coming out this
month and I'll give you guys a little
sneak peek of what I might be wearing
this is from for Louisville em is how
will gorgeous is this skirt I do have to
get it taken in a little bit but I did
get a size extra small and I will be
writing this to Coachella I know what
top yet but oh my gosh the embroidery on
this with the hanging fringe is
everything and it's not too long so it
kind of gives that fun girl they look to
it another term that everyone always
asks where I get is this one from
Topshop I've only worn it about two or
three times I definitely need to wear it
more because it is the most bomb and
metallic thing I own and then some other
disk arm skirts I have this one is from
LF I think two seasons ago and then this
one's from Nastya so says if it closed
down I'm really upset about it but this
one just has amazing stuff you guys have
seen this if you watch my down time
figure it get ready with me but I love
these okay and then under my jacket
I just keep kind of like my most worn
boots right here these are my favorite
there with Jeffrey Campbell Kors they're
amazing if you need the perfect going
out boot if you're going to be a
freshman in college you need a purchase
these and then under here I'm not very
organized and let me fold anything so I
just kind of squall and here these are a
lot of my most worn nice shirt and then
understeer I kind of Miss keep more
casual shirts like tank top this is line
fav the ragged crease and one of the
best friends ever
it just says revolting on it stuff like
that and then over here I just keep some
extra boots my Stamper is here okay
walking in to my second closet let's
start with the top so this is my denim
collection I am really obsessed with
jeans I have a step stool so I can stand
up here I
just have this hat chillin it's been
forever 21 I love it I just keep all my
jeans and then shorts here these are the
only pink pair of pants I own I recently
got them how amazing I wear size 24 and
they just have these nice lips
but they're perfect for spring coming up
talk about all of my shirts I just have
hung up right here these are more of my
nicer clothing and then I just have all
my sweaters to the right or winter
clothing but not as being warm I'm not
really wearing any of these anymore some
of my faves I love this shirt whoops
it's just this white mesh t-shirt I got
this in a size small it's from dolls
kill I love it looks really cute with
like a bra line underneath it and then
one of my faves
okay I just picked this up at wasteland
how amazing is this yellow color and it
just as well soft and kind of like
they're different yellow with a matte
design kind of a bustier style with
thick black straps
I love I can't wait to shoot it and then
they're just red leather okay this I am
obsessed with this it's just this
gorgeous
v-neck style kind of like a bra wet but
you can wear it out at night with
high-waisted jeans or shorts and it just
has these awesome elastic spaghetti
straps so obsessed I got that from dolls
kills and then I keep all my swimsuit on
top of these chest of drawers right here
but to give you guys a sneak peek this
one is probably my favorites from indoor
clothing it's just this amazing red
color super strappy on the hips
perfect cheeky bottom and kind of a
ribbed crochet design and look how
amazing this bra length is or to design
I guess you could say and then I just
have so much use right here these are my
panties from Petaluma Angie
Finch these are amazing they're the
Pumas entries in a camo and then here is
where I keep all my underwear and bras
and bra like and stuff when my favorite
bra let that I own is this form from for
lovin lemons I wore to Coachella last
year so balm it's amazing down here is
where I keep all of my t-shirts
huh way too full I need to give stuff
away so here's just one of my faves I
recently picked up it says till death do
us part I love it and that says Harley
Davidson on it what you're just think is
really cool a lot what Harley Davidson
didn't I say Harley Davidson this is big
Benson
oh I pronounced everything wrong hey
over here I just keep all of my purse
aides bags belts as you guys can see and
I have some beanies as well
my boyfriend Hayden gave me this one it
is thanks babe he's videos okay okay
this bag I bought it for the purposes of
Coachella I normally carry a Camelback
but this year I'm going to be carrying
this all three days it is from Free
People you need it I'm obsessed it was
only 40 bucks so versatile you can wear
it like this around your back or you can
put down to one strap and wear it as a
satchel is that makes sense

shoe rack at the container space I
