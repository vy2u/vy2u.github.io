to head straight to my bathroom I put my
hair up in a pony I just like it out of
my face since I'm gonna be brushing my
teeth and doing some skincare moving on
to the skincare portion of the video I'm
really excited to share with you guys
these products that I've been using for
the past two weeks because I absolutely
love love love them and I just want to
say thank you so much to bio clarity for
sponsoring this video for me
so bio clarity is a clear skin system
it's so awesome they're using
plant-based science and they're
naturally derived so it's really cool is
there's three steps I'm using the
cleanser on my face right now which is
really amazing you guys can see I'm just
lightly rubbing my face and it's really
hard for me to find super amazing
cleansers that clean my face in just one
wash so that's what I love most about
this product and you guys can just tell
from how my skin looks on camera you can
see how clean it is moving on to the
second product in the system I love this
one you just put on any acne treatment
areas that you need it really helps
clear up my skin I'm actually it's that
time of the month right now so I do have
hormonal pimples on my face it's
inevitable and that's so cool because
when you use bio clarity you can see
results in as little as two weeks which
is really awesome moving on to the third
step in the system it is my absolute
favorite because I love the way it feels
on my skin it's so cooling and soothe so
for those of you who are wondering
what's in the green it's really cool
because it's a secret ingredient called
flora luxe a naturally derived
ingredient which uses chlorophyll you
know the green material in plants and
that's just used to refresh the skin
while attacking acne causing bacteria it
heals skin and toxify x' which is so
amazing try use the third step I love
moisturizers so of course I'm going to
be taking their hydrate skin smoothie I
love it if the perfect moisturizer it's
non greasy and it's moisturizing so it's
perfect for those full and winter
seasons and I really hope you guys don't
want to try this out let me know what
you think and leave a comment down below
