video I'm gonna be sharing with you guys
basically just my September favorites I
haven't done a favorites video and just
sat down and talked with you guys and so
long so I thought this was the perfect
opportunity if you guys want to follow
me on my Instagram and it's just at
colic Heiser or you could subscribe to
our YouTube channel down below in the
description box but without further ado
I would love to just get right in the
video so here we go I might be late to
the game on this one but I've just been
wearing these two glasses lately and I
love them I think they're so fun like
even if you go out with your friends at
night and you wear them or to the beach
I just wear them as normal sunglasses
these are cute because they're orange
you can really find these honestly
anywhere and they actually make your
outfit look like a look okay some music
that I have been loving lately I love
the song cherry hill by Russ
okay I also love Miley Cyrus a song
younger now I have been listening to it
with my windows down just driving and
I've never felt so free
okay and then I just have to share I
recently discovered white Ferrari my
Frank Ocean and I've just been listening
to it on repeat because it's so freakin
beautiful
all you stand
and then su zhe o cocaine malls joke
something else that I've been doing a
lot lately that I absolutely love is
thrift shopping but what's so cool is
you can literally thrift shop online so
I want to say thank you so much to
thredUP for sponsoring this video for me
if you guys haven't heard of thread up
before thread up is basically the
largest online consignment shop which is
a thrift store and they have so many
brands that you'll love with almost up
to 90 percent off the original retail
price I love shopping secondhand I think
it's really good for the environment
there's not as much waste you can find
really cool one-of-a-kind pieces and you
get it for so much less so it's really
cool is everything that is from thredUP
is basically just brand-new secondhand
it feels like new so I'll show you guys
what I received so how amazing is this
gorgeous cute package with the blue
polka dots so when you open it up this
is how it comes it's like you just
bought new clothes it's really amazing
the tissue paper matches the outside of
the packaging so the first thing that I
want to show you guys that I got is this
amazing faux fur little jacket perfect
for a night out it's so amazing it is
the brand mink pink which mink pink is
so expensive to me so I was able to get
this for so much less and then this is
so cute with the thredUP tag on it also
thredUP offers free shipping on all
qualified orders and super easy returns
so if you don't like something you can
just send it back and totally get your
money back so this is the first thing
that I got it's so gorgeous it's faux
fur and it's literally brand new okay

don't even know how old this is but it's
literally brand new as you guys can tell

probably see these hats all over
Instagram ah this one's pulling my
favorites from the brand Brixton and it
literally completes any outfit I swear
I love it I think they're called
lieutenant hats and they literally make
any outfit I swear I have had an
obsession with mini backpacks for so
long you guys probably already know that
so these are probably my two newest
favorites of a mini backpack this is
really fun because it is what would that
mature will be like a faux fur all over
the front face of the backpack it's just
a cute little compartment just like
right in the center and how bomb is this
one it's checkered with that faux fur
and yeah I don't know how to explain how
amazing this is because also love
anything with silver chain these are my
two paper foundations at the moment
they're both by do your skin which is
just the or you guys know that and this
is the air flash and this is the three
hour forever
I'm wearing this one today I just shook
it up I blend it in with a Beauty
Blender it's just what I like to do the
best and the coverage is perfect it's
not full full coverage on me it's kind
of like medium it literally makes your
skin look so flawless and luminous it's
so beautiful if you guys are wondering
what I'm wearing as my lipgloss today
it's the glossy a lip gloss it's the
only lip gloss that they have and it is
unreal it is so pigment not
mented it's so glassy and it really
doesn't move around on my lips so I have
been super into funky jewelry lately as
you guys can tell from my necklace it
says Leo on it because I was born in
August and it's so cool cuz it's acrylic
and it's a mirror design it's from the
brand melodious Ani I also have these
Domino earrings but that's so cool I
love that I've been wearing them but for
the past week and then I'm addicted to
them they're from melodious Ani as well
and then I also love these these are
from their disco balls I know this is
like I took like jewelry holder off of
my jewelry stand so you guys could see
this um they are disco ball earrings
they are so amazing okay so one of my
favorite restaurants in Santa Monica
they have this dessert that's like a
strawberry ricotta crostata with black
pepper sprinkled on top of like cut and
glazed strawberry and it's served with
the side of honeycomb ice cream and I
love honeycomb ice cream so they told me
where to find this and la Creamery is
actually the one that makes the
honeycomb ice cream that I have at that
restaurant for dessert
so honeycomb ice cream definitely
deserves to be in this video and it's so
amazing Barney eatin a little bit
or a lot yeah this is so good so if
anyone lives in the LA area you need to
try the LA Creamery Honeycomb ice cream
I think I got it at Ralph's or Vaughn's
