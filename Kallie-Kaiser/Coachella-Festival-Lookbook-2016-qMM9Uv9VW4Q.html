outfits that you can glance at

favorite festivals or some you're
looking forward to I would love to read
those and respond to them but my
Instagram is at Cali Kaiser and my
snapchat is Cali and follow me on there
if you want to keep up with my Coachella
adventure but without further ado I
would love to get in this video also you

when you go to a festival or nothing you
really have to dress the way you would
normally do on a day-to-day basis you're
just supposed to have fun be comfortable
in your own skin and kind of just dress
obnoxious you want to kind of throw your
personality into any of the outfits that
you put together so that's exactly what
I did in this video and I hope you guys
enjoy it so here we go
doing midnight sprinkler sleep when we
would me

social medias please comment and let me

favorite I would love to read and
