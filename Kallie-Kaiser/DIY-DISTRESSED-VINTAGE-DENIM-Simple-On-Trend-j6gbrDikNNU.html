are doing another DIY so beyond excited
all of these styles are going to be
denim styled so these first denim DIY
we're going to be doing today and then
taking these amazing a yellow boyfriend
jeans they just in the end up fitting me
the way I wanted you to Toys thrift a
pair of these in order to the normal
denim pair that you layer on your house
so I'm going to cutting these into super
short super short just shorts and I'm
going to be taking its patches and we're
literally going to be just ironing these
on it's super simple and covering the
crap out of them I never seen a pair of
shorts Earth and we just covered in
Texas and that's what we're going to do
today and then our second DIYs going to
be another pair of denim jeans I
thrifted these for seven bucks they're
just boys Levi's jeans and that goodwill
I got them and we're going to be cutting
off the bottom kind of like cutting it
the way you want and then up-and-down be
it seem right here on both sides when
you taking me silver eyelid I've seen
these jeans sold for really expensive
bring me making them for super cheap I
also got this thrift at a goodwill I got
14 bucks just this really nice denim
jacket it's kind of cropped which is
what we want and then I wish this is a
longer veste veste exercise and we're
going to be replicating this denim
jacket I sort of show you guys how easy
it is to DIY your own clothes that you
might see on Instagram and you have some
info look how simple this DIY is going
to be so this is the brand first of a
kind I got this at the LF sale and I
paid for this one but I'm going to be
showing you guys how you just DIY it for
yourself I would love to you in this
video if you guys want to follow me my
Instagram is just actually Kaiser but
without further ado here we go
okay for the first DIY I'm just showing
you guys what the yellow jeans look like
on me before we cut them into shorts
so obviously you could take a pair of
jeans or thrift and acres of jeans and
we're also going to need a pair of
scissors I personally like to use fabric
scissors I got mine as UN fabrics I'm
just going to be cutting the fabric
above my knee so we have less fabric to
work with when we try them on and size
them to see where we want to cut them so
after I cut the fabric above the knees
I'm going to try them on and fold them
up to how short I want them
and then once I do that and measure
exactly where I want the shorts to be
cut oh my gosh I cannot talk I'm just
going to be cutting above where I rolled
the shorts up and you guys can see this
is super self-explanatory and then you
guys can see me making these small
incisions with scissors just parallel
all along the shorts that's because our
next step is going to be taking tweezers
and we're going to be pulling apart the
threads kind of just destroying the
edges of the shorts it's super easy and
once you throw them in the wash they
look so good
store-bought I swear
so as we finish up pulling out our last
threads I also decided to take a knife
and distress the shorts a little bit
more so once that is all done we're just
going to be throwing them in the wash
and once they're done the wash this is
what they look like oh my gosh and
obsessed the frillies on the bottom of
the shorts look so good okay here are my
patches I love them I got them all on
Amazon I'll have them linked down below
description box for you guys so as you
can see here and just layering them out
before it iron them on all of them are
iron-on patches and then I definitely am
putting some off to the side because we
need it patches for the back of the
shorts as well and when you iron-on
patches it definitely takes way longer
than I thought and you really have to
add a lot of pressure for them to really
stick and then here's what I decided to
make the back of the shorts look like i
wish i even had more patches once you
iron on all the patches this is what it
looks like I'm obsessed I think they are
so beyond perfect for summer and then in
the next clip you guys will see me
trying them on I just decided to pair it
with a bell and a crop top so you guys
can get a better feel with how I would
style it honestly I probably swear a
cropped t-shirt with this look as well I
think it's so cute this is just perfect
for summer
for the next DIY I'm just taking these
Levi's jeans that I did find at Goodwill
and lifting my leg up to show you guys
what the hem looks like so the first
step that we are going to be doing is
just cutting off a few inches of the
bottom of the jeans just because I
didn't want them to be a normal length I
kind of wanted them to be above my
ankles so as you guys can see I'm just
going to be cutting that off measuring
it and then cutting off the other side
as well similar to the shorts that we
just di wide I'm also going to be making
those parallel incisions all along the
where we defend the jeans and we're just
gonna be pulling that out with tweezers
as well and once you guys put them in
the washer and then take them out they
look so good so after a long 30 minutes
we're going to throw those in the wash
and this is what they came out to look
like from the dryer I think it's perfect
it looks store-bought I love it and then
I'm just gonna be taking my silver
eyelets I bought these at jo-ann fabrics
and I bought five packs of them and I'm
just really layering them on the seam up
and down my leg where I want to put them
and I'm just taking a black sharpie and
dyeing the holes where I'm going to be
putting the silver eyelets there's
definitely a bunch of instructions on
how to do this on the eyelet packages
itself then you guys are just going to
see me twisting out the fabric and
cutting out the silver not the silver
it's the black sharpie dots that I made
putting in the eyelet and then I'm just
gonna be hammering that in I didn't want
to show the hammering and on camera
because that would take way too long it
probably took me about 45 minutes total
to hammer them all in also ignore the
hammer marks on the jeans but this is
how good they look when they turned out
I'm obsessed and then here is just some
clips of me trying them on I really hope
you guys replicate this look I love it I
don't know where I got the inspiration
months back and I thought why not DIY
them if it's so easy so I hope you guys
love this one
for last DIY it's so simple I don't know
why I'm holding my phone in this try on
shot I don't know why anyone would give
this denim jacket way it's absolutely
amazing so yeah we're just taking any
damage jacket that you have and our
first step is going to be taking
scissors again I personally like fabric
scissors and we're just going to be
cutting off the bottom portion of the
jacket and then just making asymmetric
cutting lines all the way up until that
second button is what you guys can see
after you make cuts all around we're
going to be distressing it so that we
can throw it in the wash and it looks so
much better once we pull out so you guys
can just see me taking my tweezers
pulling threads out super
self-explanatory and then I also decided
to take a knife to the jacket as well
and I distress that as well so we're
going to throw in the washing machine
and afterwards two dogs what it looks
like I'm absolutely obsessed I already
wore this jacket today I love it so much
you guys can see the nice marks that I
did to just distress it more on the top
so that this really is match the top of
the jacket as well if that makes sense
yeah so I hope you guys love this biy as
well it sounds well it one of my
favorites honestly I wear my first of a
kind jacket before idea why this one all
the time and I needed to share it with
