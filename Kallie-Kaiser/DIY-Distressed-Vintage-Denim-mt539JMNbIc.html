video I'm so excited we're going to
doing another sick DIY video except this
one is for fall and winter season so to
show you guys what we're going to be
making today I have a normal pair of
high-waisted black denim jeans I
couldn't find any of these at Goodwill
oh into a few different locations there
might be a buck pair of high-waisted
jeans near you so otherwise just use a
pair that you already have and we are
going to be cutting out holes all up and
down the legs like this and you're going
to be able to wear sick fishnet tights
with them or just your normal legs but
yeah we're going to doing something like
this I'm so excited and then I'm also
going to be distressing these a bit more
and ripping these up and we're going to
be putting flannel underneath them I got
some of this flannel fabric at Joanne's
jo-ann's fabric so that will look really
sick and then I'm going to show you guys
how to de-stress
a denim chambre I got this at Goodwill I
found one for $7 so lucky in the men's
section just find whatever size fits you
best for your body type but I decided to
get a size large just because I like
them kind of baggy on my body type and
we're going to be distressing it like
this I got this at the LFC oh it's
first-of-a-kind brand and I spent way
too much money on it
and I want to show you guys that you can
make this denim distress just like this
no problem and then I also went to the
men's section at Goodwill and I got the
largest pair of denim jeans that I could
find we're going to be making a denim
tube top out of this it's going to look
so sick but without further ado here we
go
so some of these steps might be
self-explanatory but we are going to be
doing a voice over anyway also I'm so
sorry for the amount of times I started
sick in the intro here we go so I'm
first taking my amazing pair of
high-waisted black jeans I love these
can't wait to cut them up I got these on
princess Polly I couldn't find any
goodwill so if I can't find any it could
well just use some or find some cheap
ones online all you're going to need
index card and scissors and a sharpie if
your pants are black you could use chalk
but when I flip mine inside out a
Sharpie works better I'm basically just
cutting out a square or rectangle shape
from the index
and tracing it all up and down my legs
in hopes that it will look how I want it
to look as you guys can see I'm just
simply tracing all over my legs I did
flip the genes inside out if you cannot
tell but I do try them on before I cut
out each and every square just because
you might want to add some more to the
top like I did there was awkward spacing
and there needed to be more on my upper
thighs but after that you are just going
to get your scissors and cut out each
and every square on your legs and you
guys will see what they look like in a
sec
and once you guys are done cutting them
out you can throw them in the wash
before I tried them on i obviously did
not throw them in the wash but if you
want more of a frayed look throw them in
the wash but i decided to pair black
fishnets underneath them these are just
from forever21 super simple I love the
way these look with fishnets you could
also wear some cool nude fishnets
underneath them otherwise they look just
as great with just your normal legs
under them but yeah I'm really happy
with how these turned out and I bet they
would look even better
if you had a really long oversized
sweater or something to make a tube top
out of men's jeans you're going to need
scissors leather suede string some large
silver eyelets I just got these at
jo-ann fabrics and a hammer to hammer
those eyelets into the denim and to
start off you're going to want to
measure your bust and waist size in
order to determine the top of the tube
top and the bottom of the tube top once
you get that down you're going to take
whatever your bust size is and run it
down the leg to determine how much you
need to cut off of the actual jeans I
decided to cut the seam allowance off on
both sides of the jeans the seam that
holds the front and back of the pants
together just because for the tube top I
wanted that to determine the top and
bottom
once you cut that out just hold it up to
yourself and whatever folds over you're
going to want to cut off it doesn't have
to be perfect just mark it with some
chalk or whatever marker you have near
you I also went back and protected those
lines on the floor and as you guys can
see this tube top is kind of structured
it's kind of crooked I made it so that's
higher on one side and lower on the
other because I actually like that look
but once you cut that off you're ready
to put some eyelets in in order to lace
it up and hold it on your body I just
got these large eyelet adjoin fabrics
with 10 bucks I'm placing them on the
fabric where I think they're going to
look good I decided to use 4 on each
side so I used 8 total and you're going
to want to take a sharpie and draw a
black circle in the middle of each
silver ring and that is going to
determine exactly where your eyelid is
going to be placed I found that it was
easiest to just twist up the fabric and
cut the tip off in order to make a
perfect little circle for it to fit in
you guys will see once we get to that
step here is where we grab our hammer
it's going to show you where to put the
anvil and everything and how to hammer
the metal in with the fabric so first we
just put the anvil below and then put
the eyelet right there on top as you
guys can see and then you're going to be
hammering the metal into the other metal
I'm not inscribed this but yeah as you
guys can see it's super easy and then
once you hammer those all in its gonna
look a little something like this then
you're just going to grab your string
lace it up however you would like I
decided to do it from top to bottom and
then to make a choker to go with this
outfit you're gonna want to just take
whatever scrap you have left over from
any of the jeans you should still have
another pant leg and then just hold up
to your neck and measure how you want it
and then just repeat the steps in order
to put two eyelets on the end it looks
so good
and then once your hand with those
eyelets and just grab some extra string
that you have and tie it up and your
outfit is complete I'm wearing the
choker backwards here but you could also
wear it forwards and show the string and
then the tube top ended up looking so
sick I love the back of it and if you
ever uncomfortable wearing a tube top or
you don't feel comfortable in a tube top
you can wear it as a black corset with
like a big t-shirt underneath and it
looks just as good next we are going to
distress this Chambre and make it a
little bit more appealing as you guys
can see right now it's just too
structured it just hangs on the body so
to start off with the distressing
process you're just going to need
scissors and tweezers it's so simple you
only need two things and to start off
we're just going to be cutting off the
seam allowance on both sides I don't
know if I would call it the seam
allowance let's just say just cut off up
to around the hip of the seam on both
sides just to give the Chambre more of a
flow and it looks way better on the body
it's not as structured and do the same
thing to the bottom seam
once you do that just make small little
slits all along the bottom because we're
going to be distressing up the entire
bottom so that when we wash it or put in
the dryer it's going to have a really
cool fray to look just take your
tweezers and fray the entire bottoms if
you just pull on the bottom white
threads or blue threads it will pull
apart and it will look something like
this as you guys can see now I'm sure
you guys have distressed denim before or
made really cool leg rips in it like
you've seen on denim jeans so I just
made two slits with scissors on the top
and bottom and I'm just pulling out the
blue threads I just did this all over
the entire jacket and to just dress it
up a little more I'm pretty sure this is
not safe at all but I'm just scraping a
knife all up and down the denim shirt I
felt it was the quickest process in
order to distress it more and make holes
in it as you guys can see I did a lot to
the back and across that back seam and
it ended up looking so good and then we
can see the hip cutouts I ended up
loving how this looked and this is after
the washer and dryer
okay to make some flannel patch jeans
you're going to need scissors flannel I
bought one yard of jo-ann fabrics sewing
needles and needing needle holders some
thread and some denim jeans to distress
so I'm going to do that same thing that
I did before is pulling out the blue
threads and making holes all over the
jeans I didn't do this on camera just
because I thought you guys probably
would get the idea or you can make
someone else you can watch someone
else's really simple video on it but
this is exactly how I distressed the
jeans I made some big holes on the
bottoms and around the knees then I'm
just grabbing my flannel and I'm just
going to be cutting out a simple square
of however big I think will be perfect
to sew on my jeans and then as you guys
can see I'm just placing it where I
think I should cutting off the extra
fabric and this is going to be covering
the big knee rib then I'm just placing
some needles in to hold the fabric there
because I will be hand sewing I took a
costume construction class when I was at
unit University of Arizona so I do know
how to sew and I'm just going to be
doing a simple back stitch if any of you
guys are wanting on a back stitch you
can go on to youtube and type in how to
back stitch and there will be a really
simple video but to show you guys the
process of how to patch up your jeans
you're just going to want to measure out
a simple square pin that down with some
extra needles just so it's not moving
around when you are hand sewing it on
there
and then you're just gonna take whatever
thread I decided to use black because it
will show a little bit and it also won't
we're going to be doubling up on the
thread and I'm gonna be making this
pretty long because I don't want to have
to re use some more
I'm just trying some on the end of my
finger twisting it and making a simple
knot as you guys can see and then since
this is a back stitch I'm going to be
starting underneath the fabric and then
I'm just weaving my way through so I
don't have to go up and down through the
jeans and it's as simple as that I know
it takes a while but it looks so good
after you do it this is what the
finished product looks like I did some
up on the hips some of my knees and
lower down by my ankles I also did like
a little bootie rip with some flannel
back there as well but I hope you guys
love this DIY I'm so excited to wear
these flannel jeans I liked it better
when I covered the top part of my jeans
then when I showed the actual hips and
stuff just because I feel like I had a
better pair of jeans to do this with but
I didn't want to have to go out and buy
a pair
