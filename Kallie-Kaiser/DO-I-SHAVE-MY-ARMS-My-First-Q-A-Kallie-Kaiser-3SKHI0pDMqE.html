I'm going to be filming a QA I'm really
excited cuz I've only ever filled a
snapchat QA so I posted a photo on my
Instagram and I asked you guys to ask me
a bunch of questions and I got so many
questions
so there's 397 comments so I'm not gonna
get to all the questions today but I'll
try and answer as many as I can if you
guys want to follow me on my Instagram
it is just at Cali Kaiser but without
further ado I would love to get in this
video so here we go okay what word
describes you the best love you xoxo
love you too um I would say weird
definitely how tall are you and how much
do you weigh so I'm actually very short
on 5 3 5 foot 3 inches and I like to say
that I'm 5'4 but I'm not um and then I
weigh anywhere from like 97 to 100
pounds what's your favorite place to
vacation okay that is very hard because
I love to travel I've traveled a lot in
the past I'm so lucky for that but I
have no idea one of my favorite places
ever though Sun Valley Idaho if you've
had the Java shop steamed eggs and if
you had their Mexican hot chocolate with
homemade whipped cream it is the best
ever when I moved to Santa Monica can we
be friends without a doubt okay soccer
girl asked why did you shave your arms
okay I did not shave my arms here's my
arm hair on my arm out if you can see it
okay I did not shave my arms but I did
trim the ends with like one of those
mechanical razors and I just trimmed the
ends off I don't know why I did it but I
started to do it and I really liked it
but I don't care that I have hairy arms
I owned my hairy arms my whole life if
you could choose any name what name
would you choose to have other than your
own I don't know why but I love the name
gray so maybe I could go by grey you
describe your style in one word I have
no idea expressive may be fun I love
that word fun do you know who hacked her
Instagram I do not know who hacked my
Instagram there
i stunk they ended up hacking into my
van melle my uber my random like
nordstrom urban outfitters account so
definitely don't know who that was but
I'm happy
hopefully that it's all over with and
that it doesn't happen to the next
person cuz it really stunk
what are your favorite places to shop
probably my top two is dull skill and
411 lemons okay how old are you I'm 21
what inspired you to start a YouTube
channel so I have gotten this question
before and it's hard for me to answer
only because I kind of started my
youtube channel out of boredom so once I
graduated high school I took a gap year
before I went away to college best year
ever I think everyone should take a gap
year um but what am I talking about on
my youtube I posted a try this one more
video and it was the first video that I
ever posted I just reviewed a triangle
bikini and took a picture of myself in
it and like inputted the picture in the
video and it did really well for posting
your first video on YouTube you were
like you should make a channel so I did
so I don't really know what inspires me
to make a YouTube I think maybe just the
community itself because once you start
watching videos it like motivates you to
make your own videos and it's just
really fun okay where have you traveled
and where would you like to so I've kind
of travelled all over the place probably
not as much as some people who say they
are world travelers have obviously but
I've been to a few places in Europe so
I've been to France and then I went to
Paris in France London Germany I love
Germany I was in Italy this summer I've
been to Spain Antigua the Cayman Islands
Bahamas and then I've been to random of
the 50 states can't remember where else
but I definitely love traveling and I
really want to go to Bali and I really
want to go to somewhere that's really
exciting one of my best friends just got
back from New Zealand so that would be a
really cool place to go I have no idea
where I want to travel what are you
majoring in so I go to L mu which is
Loyola Marymount University in LA
you guys have never heard of it but I am
majoring in communication and when I
used to go to University of Arizona I
majored in theatre arts so I switched my
major to Communication Studies but is
your plan after college I have no idea
and I don't expect to know until that
time in my life how do you get so
confident vlogging in public or in your
videos in general so if you go back to
watch my first youtube video I
definitely have a different presence
online and in camera just because I felt
like a robot before when I used to be
filming but now once you film you kind
of just like it flows out of you and
it's a pattern I don't know what I'm
doing with my hands but what was the
other question of vlogging in public I
am the most Awkward human ever and when
I try and vlog in public it's actually
funny so that's probably why and some
live vlogs you don't get to see my true
self because I love logging inside and
not empowering but I'm like I'm gonna do
it I'm gonna hold my arm out all the way
what's your favorite dessert or gummy
candy okay my favorite dessert is in
Santa Monica at Tarn roses restaurant
and they have this strawberry ricotta
crostata with cut up strawberries with
like honey glaze on top and black black
pepper sprinkled on top of the
strawberries and there's a honey glaze
around the croissant which is like the
crostata it is the best Azhar on the
planet Earth you have to just go to
Santa Monica to go to taro PSA's and
order this strawberry ricotta crostata
dessert because it's the most amazing
thing ever
how did you find your personal style so
in high school I definitely did not have
a great style or in middle school I kind
of experimented a lot with definitely a
few different styles but I kind of just
now what I do is when I'm shopping
online I'll just pick out something and
I don't know if my style is considered
weird or out there but as you age you
literally find your personal style it
kind of just evolves on your body it's
so weird to say but it does what is one
of your top favorite outfits literally
wearing an oversized black vintage
t-shirt with
leather leggings and really comfy boots
okay besides Criminal Minds what shows
do you watch um i watch a lot of shows
I'm a huge film movie TV film buff
whatever that sentence just was so I
watch right now I'm watching the good
doctor
a typical um I just finished a typical
actually it was only one season I was
able to watch
I watched shameless I watched Dexter
Breaking Bad
thanks Hotel Prison Break I've watched
so many things I have no idea Gossip
Girl of course if you could be an animal
what would you be PS and love you so
much I love you so much too and I my
whole life I've always wanted to be
really tall because I thought I was
going to model and I'm five three it's
so funny because I'll show you guys
here's a photo of me and eighth grade
with my 8th grade friends
that's how short I was I was like four
four and a half in the beginning of
middle school leave um but what was the
question
Oh animal I want to be a giraffe because
I love giraffes they're so beautiful
and I want to be tall hardest part about
being in college so for me College takes
up so much time I don't know if it's
just because I transfer to a private
school now and it's just a lot harder
than I'm used to but I literally have no
time so the worst part about college is
you're really lucky if you have good
time management but I am not the best
with time management so it takes up so
much time for me but I do love college
and I'm really excited to graduate but I
kind of want to be in it forever so I
don't know where I'm at in life
do you watch Law &amp;amp; Order SVU nope I am
in love with Criminal Minds I haven't
watched it what is your favorite lip
product right now my favorite lip
product is taking the lipliner of the
Kevin a Kwan minimal my friend Emily
showed me this lip liner it's absolutely
amazing and then I love to put the
glossy a lip gloss it is such a
beautiful combo and you rub the lip
liner in with your finger so it's not a
full dark lip and it looks so good and
you can kind of over draw and I swear it
works with everyone skin tone and I'm in
with it did you recently cut your hair
slash will you ever cut your hair
shorter to it dramatically differently
so right now I actually have four inches
off my hair probably from the last time
I uploaded YouTube video which you can
probably see if you go to one of my
latest videos so I cut off about four
inches and I think it's dramatically
different what do you guys think I
really love the length and it looks so
healthy so I'm obsessed but I don't
think I would go any shorter when did
you start eating healthy and please
motivate me to so my mom raised me and
my two sisters to eat very healthy we
didn't even have Lunchables in our house
we weren't allowed to have anything like
processed it's so funny but I'm so happy
my mom raised me that way only because I
love healthy food now I never eat junk
food I never have fast food I haven't
had McDonald in like six years what do
you think about the different
sexualities that everybody's making up
pansexual for example first I need to
look at what pansexual means so
pansexual means not limited and sexual
choice with regard to biological sex
okay well I don't think people are
making up sexualities I think they're
just putting names and categorized
categorizing different sexualities I
definitely think that none of them are
made up but I feel that it's cool that
people are recognizing that there's so
many different sexualities that do exist
anyone can do whatever they want love
wherever they won't be existing however
they would like to are your hidden
talents um I can eat a whole lemon like
rind and all and I oh my gosh I used to
be able to put my foot over my head oh
my god I'm so bizarre but we're gonna I
don't know if I could still do it Oh
what did you want to do as your job
before you knew YouTube could be your
job um so I was aways in acting classes
because I wanted to be an actress are
you more of an introvert or an extrovert
I have no idea can I be 50/50 on both
only because so I'm totally an introvert
I stay in all the time like my friends
and I we just hang out chill we go to
the ocean hang out on the beach
sometimes but I don't I maybe we'll go
to a club once a month but I love
partying it's so fun
I just don't sometimes it's so much
energy to communicate with other people
that it's hard for me too and I'd rather
just stay in my bed and watch TV and
movies how do you keep productive and
motivated to work this isn't something
that's really hard for me or something
I've kind of been struggling with only
because it is hard sometimes because I'm
at school all day and then I don't want
to come home and work on something else
but since I love YouTube so much I'm
able to do school and YouTube at the
same time it's just really hard for me I
don't know I definitely have months
where I'm like not having it and it's
kind of a really chill lazy kind of
month and then I oh there huh I have a
bunch of months where I can't stop I go
to bed really late because I'm always
working on something and I'm really
passionate about what I'm doing but I
think it's just finding that balance in
between of having the right amount of
laziness with that motivation and
passion and what you're doing and it's
okay that it fluctuates because no one's
perfect Emma asked are you happy with
yourself at the moment um that's
definitely a really hard question
only because I mean it's so weird
because I'm 21 but I feel really old and
it's weird that in our society we feel
so old
even when I'm very young and I have to
kind of I have to recognize that I am 21
and I'm so young and it's cool that I'm
able to do this as a job as a 21 year
old so I have to remind myself that it's
okay where I'm at in life I
have somewhat of my life together I
don't know but I would say yes but I
also have been really lazy and kind of
unmotivated lately only because school
takes all my energy from me so I don't
know I would say yes no it just depends
on the day or the week
maybe the month can this be your last
question yes so thank you guys so much
for taking the time to watch this video
I hope I answered a lot of questions
I've really never filmed a Q&amp;amp;A that
wasn't a snapchat Q&amp;amp;A before but I love
you guys
