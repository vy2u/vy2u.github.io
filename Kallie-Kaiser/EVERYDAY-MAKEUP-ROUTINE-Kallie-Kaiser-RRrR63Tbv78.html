I'm going to be filming an everyday
makeup look or everyday makeup routine
this makeup is something I probably wear
to class everyday if I do wear makeup or
I'm just hanging out with friends
nothing like going out or taking photos
so this is just my everyday natural look
kind of makeup I love natural looking
makeup so that's what my name is kind of
everyday my eyeshadow I stick to usually
one palette if I'm trying to do really
fast eye shadow and make this kind of
like a eight minute makeup routine if
that makes sense yes so here we go I
used two different moisturizers one is
from Whole Foods this is um and dalu I
don't know that name and then this is
for travel tragic magic this stuff is
amazing amazing it um makes anything to
from a breakout to just like a pimple
kind of go away over a few nights if you
use this consistently but right now I'm
just gonna be putting this on my face I
did just get out of the shower about in
the past hour
I always just put more on out before I
put makeup on to to start my makeup I'm
doing my eyes first so I'm using this
stay don't stray by benefit and I'm just
gonna put swipes of the product on my
eyes I'm kind of running out of this
product I should get more of it soon but
this is just a sample size I switch off
between eye primers I don't always use
the same one the other one I use is from
Smashbox and it's also in a samples
container there are just some of my
eyeshadow palettes that I use on daily
basis the one I'm using today is this
Laura Mercier Laura Mercier I want to
say it's Laura Mercier I could be wrong
please correct me in the comments if you
would like so this is the palette we're
using today super gorgeous colors we're
just doing a natural look so we're only
gonna be using these that vanilla nut
fresco and truffle and then a color pop
color at the end it's gonna dip my
tapered blending brush into the white
and shake it off and I'm just patting
this down kind of mattifying the eye
primer if that makes sense then I'm
taking this fresco color and I'm just
gonna swirl it around and taps them off
I start kind of on the outer corner of
my upper lash line but normally I'm just
putting this where you would put a
transition shade like blending this at
the crease and stuff okay and then once
I finish up with that on both of my eyes
I'm gonna go in with this truffle shade
and I'm going to use a smaller corner
brush if that makes sense and I'm just
tapping this lightly into this and then
taking off the excess powder and then
I'm just gonna build this on the corner
of my lower lash line and then in the
crease as well
this just adds dimension to the other
color which I really like and then once
I build that in the crease on both sides
I'm just going to go back with my
tapered blending brush and just do small
circles all over to make sure
everything's blended perfectly I keep
all of my makeup in here oh gosh I don't
want anything to fall yeah I keep all my
makeup in here and then I put that on my
desk down there so it's really easy once
I you want to make about my desk because
I just grab and pick things from this
huge container but next we're going to
be doing our foundation I'm using the
bare minerals bare skin pure brightening
serum foundation in the same Airport
shade bare porcelain you have to shake
this really really well because it has
coconut oil which is good for my skin
because I have dry skin
once you finish shaking that I'm just
gonna apply some on my hand until I
think it's good yeah that's good okay
and then I have this on my hand and I'm
just gonna take this compact I want to
say it's a powder brush huh
and I just I'm going to dab this on my
face and then do big circles all over
and then I'm gonna put some on my neck
as well and really blend that and
and that is all blended in my face so
next i'm taking my concealer and this is
from voce vu
this is their French accents love me
Doakes I probably saying that's so wrong
but it's there North's raised it
nourishing moisture tint and concealer I
just use the concealer on the top and
then if you want something similar sound
ation they have that in the bottom it's
awesome I love their company so yeah I'm
just putting this I have a pimple on
their eye no trying to covering that up
now we're gonna go for under-eye
concealer I use bye-bye under-eye in the
shade and neutral medium oh my gosh I
read about this it's my favorite I just
do an itty bitty squirt I rub it under
my eye
another itty bitty squirt rub it under
that I'd and I'm just gonna close this I
use my finger to rub in my under-eye
concealer I know a lot of people use a
Beauty Blender or other stuff like that
and then I just rub it in a triangle
formation which is a very common way to
put on under eye concealer stuff doesn't
really crease if you add a lot it could
crease or if you don't set it with
translucent powder but other than that
it stays really really well and it's
great coverage if you do have bags under
your eyes okay next I'm going to set all
of that wrong brush I want it yes
correct brush with this um your mineral
sweet and transparent translucent powder
just comes in this
I think there's some stuck on the lid so
I'm just gonna use what's ever on the
lid and then you can see the white
powder we're just gonna set that I'm
just gonna dab this under my eyes and
then wherever I put the concealer as
well some people put this all over their
face totally fine
I have a very drying face so I try to
put it only on the places that really
need it okay cool so we set that just
for extra color I'm gonna go now go in
with this foundation powder I'm just
using this bareMinerals full flawless
face brush that was a tongue twister
yeah this is pure cosmetics
there's this much left of his hand this
is the shade light tan light tan yep
this just gives me a little extra color
in the winter time before I put bronzer
on and stuff so my all-time favorite
bronzer is probably BAM rain rolls the
skinny dip bronzer I used to have that
and then I broke it because I dropped on
the floor so lately I've just been using
this palette up park a princess by Tarte
this palette is amazing as you can tell
I've hit pan on the highlighter which is
practically gone and the bronzer yes I
just take this compact bronzing brush
shake it off umm I am not very good at
contouring so I kind of just put bronzer
on however I feel like it but I still
measure like this and then I'll do
swoops in to my face if that makes sense
and then I do a little bit up my
hairline and on my nose and bottom of my
chin yes you can see the color really
well starting to come through on my face
I'm just gonna take a Fubuki brush and
blend that out because it is a bit
bronzy now I'm just gonna go in with
this smaller brush for my highlighter
and I'm just gonna take whatever I could
get left out of here and use it my
cheeks this highlighter is great because
it's a white pigmented eye do you think
it looks best on me I do have a
highlighter from colour-pop that I use
and I really love that too gimme brow by
benefit I use the lightest light/medium
lightest shade that they own of gimme
brow and then I'm just gonna lightly run
this through my eyebrows do a couple
sweeps
this is also a gel in this as well so it
keeps your eyebrows in place and they
won't really be moving around and in
wacky positions
I just put chapstick on so I could wipe
it off so I can get this foundation off
of my lip color and now we're gonna go
back to focus on our eyes I'm going to
be using this color pop super shock
shadow in the shade fringe
I dropped it so it's a bit cracked but I
am obsessed with this color it's super
super fun so I usually just put this on
the upper lid right here and closer to
the inner corner which it looks really
great
I love the pop of color this gives to
the makeup look and I like how you can
apply with your finger which is it
really nice and easy and now we are
ready for mascara so I'm using the
roller lash by benefit I love this
mascara so much ASA clump on me when
there used to be more in the bottle but
once you get about halfway through it
you don't experience clumping a lot okay
so we just finished with mascara and now
we're going to finish everything and
just put on a lip color I normally use
this starlooks lip gloss because it's my
favorite but sometimes it's windy
outside so I'll normally just work
chapstick or this is in my purse this
NYX butter lipstick in this shade pops
explosive I love this color it's so
pretty
it also it looks great when you just
have chapstick on your lips as well I
don't put this on on top and bottom
because I want it less pigmented so I
kind of wipe it away and blend it in
with my finger is that make sense okay
and um that is my finished everyday
makeup look I hope you guys really
