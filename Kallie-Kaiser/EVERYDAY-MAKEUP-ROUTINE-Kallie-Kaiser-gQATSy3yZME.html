going to be showing you guys my winter
makeup routine just because so many of
you guys have requested my makeup that
I've been putting on my snapchat
Instagram lately
so to start off I don't know if you guys
can see right now but I have a face mask
on it's the thirsty mud hydrating
treatment mask from glam glow and it
says I use this about like two times a
week but usually I wipe it off it says
leave on for 10 to 20 minutes wipe off
or you can massage it into your skin so
I'm just going to massage it into my
skin because I have really really really
dry skin and this would act as a perfect
base primer for the makeup that we're
doing today so one of you guys have
requested this look it's super glowy and
bronzed once you have that all soaked
into your skin it's super hydrating and
I always like to take mac fix+ and I
spray this on my face before and after
my makeup because it gives it just you
know it just does if I was to use primer
I use the Marc Jacobs invisible
undercover perfecting coconut face
primer but since we just did the
Glanville mask that is going to be
acting as my primer today
I love to be extra blowy so I'm taking
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
the shade opal and I barely just take
any on my hands
and I put this on the high points of my
face we know to just give it extra color
and highlight the areas that I want
and then for foundations I have been
using the laura mercier candle glow soft
luminous foundation a lot and the Make
Up For Ever HD eyewear shade 115 so any
of you guys have good full coverage
foundations please leave recommendations
down below I'm struggling so much and I
don't know a foundation to get next and
I'm almost both out of both of these but
lately I haven't been using my Beauty
Blender I've been applying foundation
with a brush so I used the it cosmetics
complexion perfection brush it has
concealer on this side and perfect for
buffing foundation on your face on this
side so I'm using this foundation today
just because it's so easy to apply so
when I'm rushing to go to school in the
morning this is perfect to throw on my
face so that's basically how I apply it
and then I don't forget the neck I've
been loving applying my foundation was a
brush I used to and then I found the B
blender and I was like I'm never going
back but now I'm obsessed
it's a package okay guys I just got a
package in the middle of filming let
it's from Glen Lowe
I love my well is it packaging oh my
gosh
they sent what I'm using right now so
they said the flash mud and the thirsty
mud I'm using this one right now I love
their products I went to an event I
think about a week ago with them funnest
event of 2016 loved it okay for
under-eye concealer I combined these two
they're just the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye Pat this is the shade light
and it's way too light for me and this
is the shade medium and it's too dark
for me so what I like to do is do a
little nut on both so it looks like that
and then when I blend I just mix the
colors I'm not really a big fan of
eyeprimer anymore so I also put this on
my eyelids and I use that as an eye
primer and it works even better than my
eye primer that I do have
I normally don't even wear makeup to
school or everyday life and listen
filming or taking pictures so when I say
this is my everyday makeup look if I'm
wearing makeup this is what I'm putting
on my face to set my under eye concealer
I'm taking the bye-bye pores by
cosmetics and I used to set my entire
face until I found out it looks awful
when you set your entire face so I'm
only setting my under eyes my eyelids
and then any other places on my face
that I get super oily okay not to move
on to eyebrows I'm moving you guys
closer okay for eyebrows I'm taking my a
cosmetics brow power it's in the shade
Universal taupe to fill them in so I
just brush them up
okay after I'm done with my brows I just
take gimme brow from benefit and I just
run this through it gives it an extra
layer of color on there okay I'm pretty
sure my eyebrows are uneven but I was
born that way so we're gonna move on to
our eyes now I've been doing this I
makeup look for so long lately that I
completely hit pan on the transition
shade I use there is the smallest amount
of it left for here this is the kind of
cosmetic bronze palette and I'm using
the shade quartz best transition shade
ever so first I'm going to go into this
bone color I think this one's called
jaded it's all off the back so I don't
even know the names anymore even though
we already set our eyes I just like to
go in with a white base powder I've
never hit pan so extreme on a color
before and this is our transition shade
so you can put this all over the crease
on the entire eye
okay once you guys have your transition
shade down I'm taking the shade I don't
know what shade this is but it's this
really pretty dark brown warm color and
I'm using a morphe seventeen brush this
is my probably favorite crease or
blending brush to use because it's so
compact so I'm just going in with it
like this and I only put this color on
the outer corner inner corner to give my
eyes depth because they're kind of small
and squinty when I smile so I start off
I just bring in color to the outer
corner and then I'll start blending that
in little circle motions all over my eye
oh you guys know when you have a salt
look in your head and you literally it
never leaves I've been having the same
song stuck in my head for the past two
days woman so good I don't know about
you guys but I'm freaking out I'm so
excited for Christmas it's ten days away
I think I did really good on Christmas
presents this year I'm asking I've last
gosh I can't talk I asked for a blog
camera for Christmas so you guys will be
seeing vlogs soon well I don't know if
I'm gonna get it but if I do get it then
you guys will be seeing blogs once we
finish blending it should look something
like this so you have a distinct
difference between the middle and then
the two sides and what I like to do is I
take a highlighter any highlighter
really works this one is very pigmented
so that's why I like to use this one
it's the sleek makeup solstice
highlighter palette and it's this shade
right here I just take it on my finger
like this and I just put it in the
middle of that and blend it with my
finger and it looks so pretty and then I
also like to put it on the inner corner
as well
and then I'm taking the darkest shade in
the palette right here
I barely touch my brush into it just the
very tip and I'm going to do this as a
brown liner all across my upper lash
line and then to make this look even
more glowy I take my candle light loose
powder from Laura Mercier it's their
mineral illuminating powder this stuff
is amazing and I just looks like this I
dip my brush in I'm using a morphe m-43
3 and we're just adding this kind of all
over and it gives it an extra shimmer
I'm just adding more chapstick this is
the Glenn well wet lip this video is not
sponsored by Lynn Chloe I just actually
use all the products because they're so
good okay now I zoomed you guys back out
and we're going to contour I'm going in
my Smashbox contour palette I haven't
used this cute contour kit in so long so
I'm really excited I hit pan on it I
used to use it like every single day so
I'm just taking the contour shade right
here
then I warm up the forehead with it
this is how I contour my nose and what
it looks like
and then I go in with a morphe e to
brush this is such a nice big blending
powder brush and I just AM buffing out
my contour because because I like to now
for bronzer this is the best bronzer
ever it's just the perfect shade for me
it's the tantric Omega bronze from Marc
Jacobs this mirror is amazing so I just
go in like this on both sides of the
brush okay and then for highlighter
today I'm taking the Becca cosmetics
moonstone crest highlight and I take
this on my nose and I bring it all the
way up the nose as well those are my
Cupid's bow and if you want actually lo
I like to also add this on tops of my
cheeks just because it highlights way
more than the Becca cosmetics mine
okay now we are highlighted and we can
go in with our mascara
um this is my favorite one
it is the roller lash from Benefit it
just works the exact way that I want it
to right now that we are done I like to
take my mac fix+ again and since I don't
have a what's called setting spray like
urban decay setting spray I just use
this to set my makeup it also makes
everything super dewy and Lily again but
yes your oh I got it in my hair and that
looks crazy great thank you guys so much
