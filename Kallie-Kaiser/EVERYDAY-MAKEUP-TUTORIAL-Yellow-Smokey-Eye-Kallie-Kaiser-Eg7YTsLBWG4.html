licked off my lip gloss
huh are you so beautiful hey guys is a
towel and for today's video I'm going to
be showing you guys my everyday go to
summer makeup look
I am obsessed with this yellow smokey
eye and I'm so happy that so many of you
guys were to see it and request this so
if you guys will follow me on my
Instagram you can it's just actually
Kaiser and you can subscribe to my
youtube channel if you would like I
would love you click that button down
below
I am so obsessed the color yellow at the
moment I don't know how I didn't own
yellow clothing until now
but I'll have a link down below in the
description box for everything I put on
my face in this video and without
further ado here we go to start off any
makeup look like always moisturize my
skin first so my skin is really dry now
because I haven't put any moisturizer on
I literally just washed my face so I'm
using my Kate Somerville exfoliate
little moisturizer holy crap I love love
love this I've been using it for about
two weeks now look at how gorgeous this
color is it's like a mint green it's
also been fresh I really like this
moisturizer because it's really light on
my skin what are you at night honestly
is I keep this eye cream it's the OL
Henriksen transform uplifting
transformation eye gel
I love eye gel so this is really nice I
sleep in this if you're wondering how I
take care of my under-eye bags so when I
wake up in the morning no bags and then
for chapstick I always have to
moisturize before I start my makeup so
we're using the Brazilian kiss lip
butter I'm addicted to this I apply it
even though I applied it like a minute
ago also ignore I have this my lip right
here my dog head-butted me in the face
and I got a blood blister on my lip
still love her though okay so I have
never used the Mario Badescu rose water
I know I'm the only person on the planet
you know spray a little in my face I'm
so good for my primer today I am taking
the wonder glow instant soft focus
Beauty flash from Charlotte Tilbury
maybe that was way too much okay I love
this primer so much
look at that low it's perfect for summer
that's why I'm so obsessed with it so
for our foundation I'm using the D you
are forever I like to keep new products
in boxes until I actually have to get
rid of the box
does anyone else do that weird so I've
already used this time you should many
times I love it so the other day I went
in the Sun and I think I got a little
color I know I'm very pale but I got a
little bit of color so I think we'll be
able to use this today and I'm using
just this it cosmetics kind of like a
flat kabuki brush to apply this all over
my face I personally I apply foundation
on a brush kind of in circles and
patting motions
I can't un explain how actually flawless
this foundation is it's just so gorgeous
I don't go crazy with contour in the
summer but I know you guys have seen me
use this product it's the hoola quickiy
contour stick and I just put only a
little bit on my cheeks and I'll put out
my forehead or anything I'm just taking
a really small it's the Sephora multi
tasker complexion brush just to set my
eyes on to e meat trail a temporary
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder I really like this I'm
taking it on a compact brush I already
put eye primer on my eyes eight primes
them and I put my foundation all over my
eyes for our transition shade I'm taking
the take me on vacation palette and I'm
using this shade the shade surfboard
it's right here I am barely touching my
eye with it because I want the color so
not really shows the next I'm going to
be taking the only yellow shade in the
palette it's right here it's so pretty
just like a little pale yellow okay
we're just putting this all over the lid
okay once I'm done packing that color on
the eye eye then I'm taking my Natasha's
you know de palette I'm obsessed with
this they have the most beautiful yellow
shade in here and I'm taking a really
big fluffy brush from morphe you're
putting this where you would put a
transition color all over the crease
these two yellow colors complement each
other so well once I'm done blending the
yellow out as much as I would like I
then like to take the light orange color
in the night oestrogen on a pallet I
definitely take a more compact morphe
brush it's the morphe e17 and I just
focus this more towards the outer corner
and inner corner I don't put a lot of
orange on the eye because I want it to
be a yellow smokey eye
once I add the orange I like to take my
big fluffy brush again and blend it all
out this one's from morphe as well it's
the morphe 27 for a little bit of
shimmer I like to take this shimmery
shade and then etosha xenon a pallet so
pretty and I just plop this on the
middle of my lid for my eyebrow I use
this in like every video it's the BLA
see a boy brow it's honestly that good
that's why I use it every time I need to
get more makeup so makeup is expensive
for my under eye concealer I'm taking
the chart shape tape this stuff is so
full coverage
I only just do a small dot under each
eye
it really brightens up here under
artists
event and going to put eyeshadow
underneath my lower lash line I am
taking this Sigma pencil in e30 and
we're just going back with either one of
the yellow shades is totally fine I'm
going to take the natascha - no no one
and I only put yellow underneath my
lower lash line just to set part to my
face i take the charlotte tilbury again
it's the airbrush polish finish powder I
use the shade fair and I kind of just
use this to swipe away any leftover
translucent powder under my eyes
so now I'm taking the benefit hoola
light and I'm using this morphe bronzing
brush it's the m5 q7 this gives the best
application for bronzer because kind of
lets you contour with your bronzer which
I love I'm not really I don't really
care to contour my entire nose so I'm
going to squeeze the brush and then go
like this Alejo voila
for my highlighter I don't know if you
guys are sick of me using the same
products but this is my everyday makeup
tutorial so this is the Mac soft and
gentle so subtle and beautiful
I always add my blush after my highlight
just what I like to do so I'm using the
confidence in your glow little palette
and it's really really pretty blush it
also comes with a brush and you just do
like one swipe through them all and
Widow II as the perfect color so clearly
all my eyelash extension to fallen out
so I really want to try this embellish
lash it's by Sigma this is a brown
mascara I used to use Brown mascara all
the time I don't know why but I really
like Brown mascara so let's try this one
out you guys can see how Brown it is
it's not black so we're just going to
put a little bit on I don't really love
mascara so apply is nice and it looks
really good with the yellow for our lips
I'm so excited about these holy cow
they're the jus a high pigment lip gloss
with coconut oil in them how gorgeous is
this packaging I just bought them and
the shade have been using the most like
every single day is this PCH sure so
that's what we're going to do I like to
take a little lip liner this is just a
little Marc Jacobs lip liner in the
shade
Primrose write a line I left a little so
it's like a little cloudier this is in
the shade PCH holy cow it's so gorgeous
I love it for setting spray I like to
take being morphe scrapped and set and
we're just going to spray this okay and
this is the completed everyday makeup
look if I do wear makeup this is exactly
what I do thank you guys so much for
