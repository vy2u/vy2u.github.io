probably my most requested makeup
tutorial I've ever put on my youtube
channel so I'm really excited in this
video if you want to follow me my
Instagram is that Kelly Keizer but for
today's tutorial it's just going to be a
really beautiful warm a glowy smokey eye
I've been doing this every single day
and any Instagram and YouTube video you
guys follow me to show you guys this
look so without further ado here we go
so I don't know if you guys can tell I
got eyelash extensions
I am beyond obsessed I think they are so
beautiful it's like my eyes are
fluttering like fairies I think it's
that's the weirdest analogy so I got
them done today I sat in the chair for
two hours that treat yourself studios
I'll link their Instagram down below if
you want your so if like mine you need
to go to them they're amazing I got a
full set of individuals put on and they
were put on by Karen Medina her
Instagram is KVM on his for lash
extensions so I'll link it all down
below description box and then I also
dyed my hair a really bright white
blonde I just wanted some change this is
probably as much change as I'll ever do
to my appearance but I do love it and
yes enough small talk so the first thing
that I do when I do my makeup as I put
chapstick on and this is the glam blow
plump bridges gloss lip treatment
obsessed so it makes your eyes it makes
your lips I mean feel like they grow 10
sizes bigger which is amazing if I leave
this on all the way throughout my makeup
my lips will be bigger by the end of
this video I promise you so then I like
to turn my face I have been using this
first aid beauty fab first aid beauty
like that abbreviation so this is the
coconut skin smoothing priming
moisturizer obsessed oh my gosh I love
this also the size is so nice so I just
do this and then I put it on my face
oh so cool okay once that is all soaked
in we're ready to go in for our
foundation I use the cap on the Lockett
foundation because it is cool tones so I
have no red or yellow or pink on your
tones which I'm obsessed and I use the
shade light for for cool on a damp
Beauty Blender this is my pink one love
it I just do about one pump total my
whole face and I just go in I love this
foundation because it's really matte so
if you don't want to set your whole face
with translucent powder you don't have
to even though this is full coverage
depending on how strong your freckles
are if you have freckles they can still
kind of piece through sometimes it's so
cute
I'm putting foundation on my under eyes
as well because for my everyday makeup
look I don't use under eye concealer
every single day just because I feel
like you need to unless you have really
dark circles
I wasn't English this is the Laura
Mercier translucent powder
I still set my under eye because I did
put a foundation under there and so this
is a really matte foundation you don't
need to set your entire face but if you
want to go right ahead I kind of set
places that I get Dewey's and then
places where I don't like the feeling of
foundation on my face so to start off
this look I'm using the mineral luma
nating powder we're gonna go straight to
the eyes this is in the shade
candlelight from Laura Mercier best
transition shade you could ever put on
your face no joke so I just go in and
dip in with a tapered blending brush
this is one from a cosmetics and
tap off any excess I was really nice
about this shade so buildable so you
really don't have to worry about being
messy or precise you guys can kind of
see the warm 30 come through it's so
beautiful after that we're going with
the modern or Renaissance palette from
Anasazi of Beverly Hills and we're using
this shade red ochre beautiful shade and
I'm just taking the morphe e17 brush
looks like this and I just lightly dip
in tap off any excess and I'm only
putting this on the inner corner and
outer corner and it creates this amazing
dimension in the middle of my eye
and then since we just put it on the
outer corner and inner corner I leave
the middle hollow in a sense so that you
could put on highlighter in the middle
so I'm using this sweet makeup palette
and it's just this light pink shade
right here I just dip my finger in and
apply it in the middle and it instantly
makes it the most beautiful eye shadow
ever oh my gosh
and as you guys can see it's already so
glowing so beautiful so then I like to
take my soft and gentle highlighter from
Mac and I take this Sephora fan brush
and I just run it over throw it to the
eyes and it makes it even more prominent
and more stunning and then I just take
the same color scheme on my under eyes
but for this transition shade I like to
go in with the burnt orange in this
palette
if you end up choosing to put eyeshadow
on your lower lashline you've done with
your eyes and then I like to take the
colossi a boy brow and just put this to
my eyebrows because it adds just the
best color to them this is one of the
products I highly recommend i used to
use benefits all the time and then once
i tried this as like a girl obsessed now
moving back to our face since we need to
add some dimension to it I'm taking the
hourglass ambient lighting powder a lot
of people use this to set their face or
they want a foundation that day they'll
use it as an overall powder i actually
contour in bronze with it I've hit pan I
need it finally by the large one but I'm
just going in with this luck C 5 to 2
tapered highlighting brush and you guys
will see it what natural shadows are
created on my face on this product
amazing
plans on adding that to my face I just
going with my highlighter I'm using Mac
soft and gentle best highlighter on the
planet earth I love when a highlighter
is a wet glowy look instead of a powdery
so that's why I always choose Mac soft
gentle over all my other highlighters
and I add it to my nose a lot now for
lips I'm just taking off some of that
lip plumper I had on earlier and I'm
going in with this shade it's called
cake from glossier it is a beautiful
lipstick oh my gosh so natural and it
shows out even better now that my lips
aren't trapped or anything you guys can
just see that pigment on the bottom
amazing and then my favorite thing to
put on top of it and this it is that lip
Max Meyer Maximizer collagen active and
Dior in the shade 0:06 it is their base
shape looks like this amazing packaging
and they're just the perfect duo
together it complements the eyeshadow so
perfectly
and once you do that we are double to
make it look I cannot add mascara today
just because I have eyelash extensions
now and I don't really put a lot of
mascara on my bottom lashes but you can
totally - - if you wish that is our
completed book it's just super glowy and
warm and beautiful I love the way this
looks I'm sure it will work with so many
different skin tones hope you guys loved
