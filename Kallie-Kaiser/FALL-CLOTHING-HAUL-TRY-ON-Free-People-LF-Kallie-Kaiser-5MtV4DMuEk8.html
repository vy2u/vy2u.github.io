I'm doing another haul I know a long
time no see but this one is definitely
more full inspired I will be trying on
everything for you even though there is
still some bikinis and a pair of shorts
in here it is totally fall inspired I
have some jackets black jeans booties
ripped jeans some graphic tees so here
we go start off this haul I have some
stuff to share with you guys from
princess Polly I love them they are on
Australian online boutique they are
literally my favorite Aussie online
boutique they have some great stuff I
was able to pick out all of this so I'm
really excited to share its with you
you can also get 20% off of anything I
show you right now if you use the code
love Callie I'll have it on the screen
and in the description box but the first
is this amazing bomber jacket it's kind
of oversized on me I got in size extra
small it is suede so it keeps you really
nice and warm this is perfect for fall
to look amazing with any type of denim
wash and some fall booties since it's
suede it's super soft it has pockets and
then I also like these darker tan
stripes that come along the front and
then there's one in the back you guys
will be able to see more of it when I
try it on I have one of this t-shirt for
so long it says cool bananas on it I got
it a size small / medium I love how it's
cut on the bottom and on the sleeves
it's just a straight seam across but
it's not going to fray or anything like
that
I love how retro this looks and I think
it looks really good with denim lately I
have been obsessed with anything that
wraps up or you can tie multiple ways so
I have two of these tops to share with
you guys the first one is a little bit
more funky just because the colors and
the sleeves so the top looks like this
you can tie in the middle or around your
waist just depending on how you want and
look at how amazing these sleeves are
they are so hippie and fun they're just
really flowy and delicate this is more
of a cropped style top I got this in the
size extra small the neck strap top is
so pretty because it is a perfect color
for fall the sleeves are just as fun
they're just a little bit more fancy
this one has more
machine to it not as silky but I don't
know you guys can see I got this in a
size small I believe and then you can
tie this several different ways as well
and this is going to look amazing with
black or denim washed or even a skirt so
I have grown out of all my black jeans
so I got some more black jeans to share
with you guys these ones are just that
simple perfect long skinny leg fit they
are high-waisted I got these in a size
extra extra small I think they were size
six or seven I could be wrong um they
look like this they look amazing with
crop tops or any of those wrap tops that
I just showed you they're really thick
so they are going to keep you warm
during the fall and winter season I love
any jeans that have that wax finish or
that sheet we all know if you guys can
see so these are some really nice waxy
black skinny jeans they're not as high
as the last parish ode you um I got
these in a size 7 but they still I would
consider them high rise but they
definitely aren't low-rise I don't
really wear low-rise jeans anymore
because I don't like the way they look
on me that these are going to be so balm
I also received some sunglasses these
are so nice because they're that light
pink purple mirror look I will be
wearing your glasses for the rest of my
life I think they're so cool they look
amazing in photos but I also like the
gold detailing around the rims these are
still that rounded mirror look as well
as an aviator so I don't know the exact
style of these glasses but I love them
I've also been looking for necklaces
like this for so long so I'm so happy to
have it on their website it is just a
silver chain across it's a choker and
then has a bunch of dangling crosses
that just come out around the neck this
looks amazing layered with anything I
then went to brandy melville and I was
able to pick up this sweater it is just
that beautiful sky light blue color I
really like it's really stretchy this
isn't itchy at all I just wanted
sweaters that I could throw on over
bathing suit or anything to go to dinner
or anything to keep me warm really sense
while the top of sweaters I recently did
just pick up this sweater as well the
sleeves are super fun because they're
slit I don't know if you guys can tell
by that but they're just cut I love that
look and it's also almost a Turlock or a
high-neck so this is really great for
fall or winter or layering and then
the hips just go slit so these look
really good with tight skinny jeans or
anything like that I have been wearing
this almost every single day to school
every single day to lunch anytime I go
out of the house and I'm wearing teacher
and I need to stay warm I wear this it's
just this
dennah button-up big oversized shirt
it's slit on both sides you can probably
find something just like this I could
well I have actually wanted this what do
they call it shaumbra they call it a
chambre I have one of this denim chambre
for so long because they had it in the
LF Fall collection it is first of a kind
so it is vintage so all of the designs
are different and different denim washes
but I was so happy to had at that loves
at the able to carry on the theme with
denim I got some more karma or denim
jeans these ones are probably my
favorite they are size 24 look at the
bottom of them this is my favorite I
have loved any jeans that pray like this
at the end I'm trying to figure out how
to do on my own but it never looks this
perfect and then there's just some rips
all up and down the legs and my favorite
thing is this booty rip right here I'm
just in love with that these are my new
favorite everyday jeans they're not you
tie and they're not too loose which I
really like they also have a booty rip
like this they're from karma or denim
these are in a size 25 the knees are
completely cut open which I really like
and then I just rolled the bottoms
because they're not as skinny around the
ankles I've had my eyes on these shorts
at Topshop for a very long time and
since it is no longer summer I got them
on sale these are a size 4 they're the
mom style Topshop moto mom they have
some rips of above the upper thigh and
then the back just looks like this but I
love the stripes with the denim and the
white design I think it's so fun and
then anyone who has heard of Pacific and
driftwood their bathing suits are so
expensive so I went online to Pacific
and driftwood on their Labor Day sale
and they have such high prices so I'll
show you guys what I go on there I also
wear these underneath sweaters as bra
likes to so you don't always have to
wear them as bathing suits throughout
the season they look like this there
I like that tan mesh color right here I
got this in a size small and it fits
really good and then I also got this top
I had wanted this top on nasty al for so
long so I'm so happy that Pacific and
driftwood had a sale on their website
last week and I got this light rainbow
design one and then I also got that in
gray just because I love it so much so
here is that and these tops are all in
this size small and they fit me really
good and then I often matching bottoms
to this gray one that is actually
reversible and it can go with be black
bikini or gray bikini I got these in a
size medium because I didn't want them
to be as cheeky on me
I also have some amazing shoes to share
with you guys so the first ones are
these amazing chunky cork platform shoes
I got these on sale at free people calm
I love them they do run a bit big
since my foot is so narrow they are size
six and a half I believe there are 36
which is I believe European or
Australian sizing I could be wrong they
just have black leather on the top that
goes across your toes and then back
against the ankle and they just strap in
and then they lace up the entire leg
depending on that style I'm obsessed
with these I've only worn them once by
now so nice I love black booties they're
my favorite I don't want any black
movies just like this they have an
amazing really thick chunky heel they're
not too high so you can definitely wear
them casual or fancy they have a super
thick silver zipper right here that just
goes I can get these at the LF style but
they are the brand's sole Santa I don't
know if I'm pronouncing that right but I
really like them they are more of a cut
off toe rather than pointed and they are
a six and a half anyone who knew Saint
Laurent or Sam Edelman they have shoes
just like this but they were too
expensive so I didn't buy them but I
found these on the nasty aisle sale
section and they lace up or ladder up
the entire foot with this SiC Western
belt buckles along the stretch which I
love
they are pretty high heel which I
normally don't purchase anymore but
these were just so I attract
I attracted they were so I catching so I
had to get them they are from Nasty Gal
they are by NAS DL I got them a size 6
in case they ran large and they fit me
so good
and I have some swimwear to share with
you guys I know fall is right around the
corner but I buy swimwear all year round
plus this brand is Australian and
they're about to have a summer in
Australia so that makes so much sense ok
I am a love with this bikini is by
Mossman swim they literally just
released their bathing suits and they're
releasing more styles over the next
three months I know this collection is
really like poem tree tribal um super
earthy inspired I'll show you guys some
of the pieces so all their patterns are
removed the straps are adjustable on the
tops as well as around the bus I am in
love something about this pattern is so
aesthetically pleasing to me and they
started off as a underwear company and I
know they're transitioning and just when
were as well because they've gotten so
many requests I think they're also doing
men swimwear soon as well so I'd look
out for that but here are the bombs to
this I wear size extra small in their
brand
I love these bottoms they're really nice
they're really nice they are full
coverage which is nice for people that
don't enjoy cheeky bikinis and then some
other other styles are on this one I
really like this one because it is
pastel print and here's the top that
matches that and then there's this one
it's pink with palm trees that I drop
the bottoms no we're in the bottoms go
here they are I love this one as well
I normally don't wear pink but since
it's pink and black together I really
like the way it looks and then this one
is super fun and funky for anyone light
likes anything different I love anything
different you can also incorporate any
of these styles together they also have
a very simple style just like plain
black bottoms whoops
I like they just fit me as well and you
could totally rock this with this top or
even this top you don't always have to
wear them with the matching piece which
I really love I swear I have one more oh
this this bikini
I love Navy bikinis I think they're
super fun this one's definitely more
girly um which I really like because I
don't
girlie bikinis okay but I'm obsessed
with this one I want to take if I wanted
to take photos in it for so long I just
love the way this looks
I love graphic tees I got this one from
MN Sam online they also have at the LF
sale to um it says the mermaid on it and
it's just a skeleton of a mermaid and I
think this looks like a clog I don't
know but I really like this the sleeves
are kind of oversized and then they make
them a rollup right here which I really
liked
this is in the size extra so thank you

watch this video it really means so much
