I'm gonna be showing you guys my
festival favorites I have gone to quite
a few festivals thus far in my life and
I'm still going to a few more this
season and there are a lot of favorites
that have definitely snuck into my
everyday routine or are just perfect for
summer lifestyle so just for fun I put
all the products that I want to talk
about in my perfect festival backpack I
got this on dolls kill last year but it
is Steve Madden and I can't wait to talk
about the products that I have to show
you guys so out further ado here we go
I'm actually going to a musical festival
this weekend it is called ball rock in
Napa Valley California and I have never
been to Northern California so I'm
freaking out because everyone tells me
the scenery and landscapes are so
gorgeous I'm going with my mom and my
older sister but by the time this video
is up I will have already go on to the
festival but since I'm going to be
frolicking around in the Sun and I don't
want to have to worry about sun damage
when I'm dancing my heart out I'm going
to see the killers Anna Halsey and Bruno
Mars and Laney and shakey graves there's
so many artists there but I'm going to
be bringing my Hawaiian Tropic
antioxidant plus sunscreen I am so
excited because Hawaiian Tropic is
sponsoring this video thank you so much
to my entropic for sponsoring this video
Hawaiian Tropic antioxidant plus helps
prevent long-term skin damage and
premature aging from the Sun and also
features the og signature Hawaiian
Tropic scent which I love and it's also
made with a green tea extract to form an
antioxidant protective layer when you
put it on your skin since it is
recommended by the Skin Cancer
Foundation to protect your skin from the
sun's harmful rays the Hawaiian Tropic
antioxidant plus is amazing because it
has UVA and UVB protection and it comes
in 30 SPF and 50 SPF I use fifty because
why not but also what I love most about
this product is the antioxidant plus is
made for daily use so I can use this
every single day not just while I'm at a
festival wearing it all day long and it
is water resistant for up to 80 minutes
so you don't have to
load each and every time you get in and
out of the water
only after 80 minutes it wears off which
is great another festival favorite is
going to be my Hawaiian Tropic SIL
hydration weightless after Sun I love
this because when I put it all over my
body it feels like it's barely on its
non sticky its non racy and it gives my
whole entire body 24-hour moisturization
thanks to the dual Ribbon formula
infused with the moisturizing lotion and
ala which you guys can see in the
packaging which is really cool the
Hawaiian Tropic silk hydration
weightless after Sun lotion is
formulated to help preserve your tan
nourish your skin and it also features
an amazing coconut and papaya fragrance
which is amazing it smells like summer
my skin is never feeling very dry or
dull when I'm using it if anything it
makes my skin feel more hydrated and
pamper than any other product I have
used before if you guys do want to check
out any of these Hawaiian Tropic
products just check out my description
box below right around the time of like
a month before Coachella maybe Urban
Decay sent these in a PR box you guys
don't even know what I'm talking about
yet but I am obsessed with these and I
can't wait to talk about them so I don't
know if you guys could tell but in this
video I'm wearing blue eyeliner and blue
mascara they Urban Decay has these color
mascaras that are just super cool so
they're called the Urban Decay double
team special effect colored mascara in
this part of their vais collection and
it came with these super creamy because
I hit myself in the face super creamy
amazing color eyeliner as well so a look
that I've been doing lately is I'll do
either blue eyeliner with blue mascara
or purple eyeliner with purple mascara
but I also love doing purple eyeliner
with pink mascara these are just what it
looks like they're dual ended never knew
I would ever be obsessed with colored
mascara be able to wear it during the
day or to a brunch but it's fun when you
have a mono kradic monochromatic makeup
on matching your eyeshadow on your lips
and your blush okay
these are totally worth talking about
I am obsessed with these some days one
of the three or four days depending on
how long this festival is I don't like
to wear the makeup one of the days and I
would rather just wear kind of
moisturizer with like a cz cream and an
all-over kind of glow so these are the
Bobbi Brown glows this is the Bobbi
Brown extra bear glow it's just
illuminating moisture balm and then this
is a totally different consistency but
it is a Bobbi Brown all over lo these
colors are so gorgeous they're really
versatile for everybody's skin tone but
I loved sweeping this underneath my eyes
kind of wiping it up towards the high
points of my cheeks because geez make
your face look so dewy and so hydrated
when I pump this one out I wouldn't say
it's like a Vaseline texture but you
definitely want to do a little goes a
long way and how gorgeous is that
highlight it kind of looks wet on camera
and then the illuminating moisture balm
is kind of more like moisturizer
consistency but this is just gonna be
another gorgeous glow if you guys can
see that
and I even wear this every single day
just College okay I do not think that
these are talked about enough especially
for festival favorites so this is a
company lemonhead Los Angeles I am in
love with these glitter pots they call
them space paste so I have the shade
dirty punny and Silverlake I've used
these for about a year and a half now I
wore them to Coachella one of the first
years that I went and when I do use
these a little does go a really long way
especially if you're putting it on your
eyelid as eyeshadow which I highly
recommend but you can also put it in
your hair anywhere on your body people
have been so creative with these if you
creep on their Instagram this is my
favorite dry shampoo at the moment is
the brand playa it is just called the
pure dry shampoo absorbs oil and audio
Lee obviously eliminates impurities in
our hair so this is the best-smelling
dry shampoo I've ever smelled like they
need to make a body spray out of this
scent it is so good they also have
shampoo conditioner I also use their
shampoo I mean this year it's really
good
is SLS and paraben free and it's great
because it's color safe I did just get
my hair a little bit blonder hope you
guys can tell but if you're wondering
who did it if you're in the LA area
Bianca color she's amazing and I love
what she did with my hair I just spray
it like six inches away from my hair
gives it some volume makes me feel a
little bit more confident and takes away
when I have a little bit of an oily head
my most asked question on my channel and
Instagram is where are your rings from
so I'm gonna tell you guys where I get
my rings the Rings that are not very
expensive on my hands are no more than
twenty dollars and I did just get them
at sterling silver random shops but
lately when I've updated my collection
this ring is a Gucci butterfly I
recently got it on Poshmark for $90
someone had it on their Poshmark for 250
and I offered 90 and they accepted it
right away so you guys don't need to be
spending full price on anything
especially if you want it to be a cool
designer piece this one is a 2012 David
Yurman and I got it for 200 they said it
was normally around 800 to a thousand
which I didn't spend nearly that and
it's so gorgeous it's so clean the stone
is still brush in the ring and then this
boss ring is from the brand pretty
connected I'll link it down below for
you guys and then this one it says faith
on it I got that at young life camp for
literally thirteen dollars when I was in
high school and then this ring is
probably one of my favorites it's chrome
hearts this was definitely maybe over
500 but I'm not gonna guess a high price
and be wrong and I only got this for a
hundred and forty dollars I hope that
helps quite a bit for you guys but if
you guys have any more questions about
my jewelry please comment them down
below and I will answer them okay so
what I've been wearing on my lips lately
are definitely these products I have
these with me whether I'm traveling
they're in my purse they're in my car I
love these they're so easy to just throw
on so the first product I want to talk
about are the Laura Mercier it's velour
extreme matte lipsticks oh my gosh so my
favorite shade is this one I think it's
called vibe
I love vibe and then Ruth
is the other shade it's really pretty I
love so much and I just mix them with
everyday chopsticks whatever you're
wearing so lately what I've just been
putting on my lips is the Frank body lip
balm this is just their classic smooth
one love it and then this is the EOS
evolution of smooth deep hydration lip
mask it's from their aqua collection so
I've just been using these on my lips
and I like to mix it with the matte
lipstick because it leaves a gorgeous
satin finish and then something that's
even more to go I have talked about this
Dior product on my channel before but it
is the Dior Addict lip glow in oh oh six
the shade berry it is probably a little
bit dark for me but I just lightly tap
it on my lips and I love the way this
looks it looks so good in the Sun at a
festival I highly recommend this product
to I have been using the Too Faced
hangover 3 and one replenishing primer
and setting spray for quite a while now
and this is the one with coconut water
probiotic based ingredients and it
revives skin but that came out with a
mini travel size so how cute is this
this fits perfectly in my backpack to
just throw in thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch this video don't
forget to check out my description box
to check out the Hawaiian Tropic
antioxidant plus sunscreen and the silk
hydration weightless after-sun lotion
there will be a link for you guys in my
description box but without further ado
I'm leaving so I have a lovely day yeah
