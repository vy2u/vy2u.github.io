recreating my Coachella Festival makeup
looks just because you guys have
requested this and I have a bunch of
your makeup products to share with you
guys the main focus of this video is
definitely going to be really fresh
highlighted dewy skin I can't wait to
get into this video if you want to
follow me on my Instagram is a colonizer
without further ado here we go to start
any makeup look I always have to make
sure my face is hydrated so today I'm
taking the glam glow glow starter this
is their mega illuminating moisturizer
it is amazing it has a bunch of
nutrients botanical and tea oxy in it
which is a golden root technology that
just floods out gold skin and completely
hydrates and moisturizes it which is
exactly I need Plus this makes it look
like I highlighted my entire face which
everyone loves highlighter in 2017 is
literally the prettiest color ever so
I'm just using this as a moisturizer and
putting this all on my face as you can
see is a little bit tentative so it just
brings my face to life pushers illusion
looks so doing brush so I've got the
beach all day today and I'm an idiot I
fell asleep in the sand with a sweater
on and I didn't have sunscreen on and
this is what happened to me
there's holes all my back out my brush
can see it but but there's literally the
shape of a sweater on my skin on my back
and I don't know how long it's gonna
last
I haven't gone farther like this in so
long I'll keep you guys updated okay and
then once I put that all over my entire
face you can just see how glowy and
hydrated looks so now we're going to go
in with what our foundation is and I'm
using UVA cosmetics CC cream and this is
also SPF 50 which is really nice
so you don't get sunburned I just put a
little bit on my hand and I justified
this with a Beauty Blender I like the
actually blenders and this is just
dance I love all my freckles show throws
and that's why we're using a CC cream
today and when I was at a festival all
day long way better to have a CC cream
on your face and a full coverage
foundation that's just what I think
personally okay once we have our
foundation base on I like to go in with
my glam glow plumper Aegis I use this in
every makeup tutorial ever and I love
this because it's a lip plumper such a
good lip treatment I leave this on all
the way while I do my makeup because
then I don't have any chapped lips at
the end it looks so good when you put
lipstick on I recently picked this up
it's the hoola Ricci contour stick is so
creamy so I'm just going to be putting
this on my face it flies off so easy I
don't know if you guys can tell and it
blends out so nicely on the face
and they won't remove anything
underneath
now to highlight this phase I'm going to
be using another gland blow blow starter
this shade is just so much lighter it is
their nude glow and I'm using this as a
highlight on my cheek ball and I'm
putting on my nose and I'm like Cupid's
bow you guys will see how amazing this
looks I love doing looks I'm not even
going to be shedding a lot of my face
which is the source of it so I just
taking my finger you can take it on the
Beauty Blender as well and this is
what's going to give your skin a really
nice dewy almost that wet look
I love highlighters that make my skin
seen wet and really fresh at the same
time which a lot of you guys compliment
on my Instagram photos I also put this
underneath my eyebrows before we're
going in for a makeup look
I'm taking my lossy a Boyd brow and this
is the shade blonde and I just lightly
brush through my eyebrows it keeps it in
place all day long so you don't have to
use another eyebrow cider on top of this
otherwise I would just take a chapstick
that you have if you want to set your
eyebrows but you don't own an eyebrows
better and then I'm going to be taking
my hourglass ambient lighting powder in
the shade dim light on just a really
small tapered highlighting brush I'm
just going over the cream bronzer to
give it to give my face a little bit
more shape
I love how natural this product is okay
to start our eyes shadow I'm going to be
taking the Natasha to Donna Paola and
I'm really focusing on the warm colors
in here so I'm mostly just going to be
focusing on these three colors and I'll
use this as kind of an inner corner
highlight right here so to start I'm
just taking my tapered blending brush
from it cosmetics and I'm dipping into
this bold color to kind of set we're
doing a really simple eyelid today it's
going to be just as glowy as the face
and we're going to add some glitter to
the middle of our eyelid as well okay
and now I'm taking the same brush
dipping into this really pretty warm cut
like a rose copper colors I'm going to
be putting that all over my crease
because I really wanted to show behind
the glitter we're putting on my eyelid
I'm switching brushes I'm just taking a
little bit of this darker brown color on
the morphe 17 brush tap off any excess
I'm just putting this in the crease
outer corner it's just creating more
dimension to my eyes that seem so flat
I'm taking the royal and langnickel
evolution bx9 5 brush and I'm just
putting all the color that I put on my
eye on the lower lash line the dirty
penny shade and this is the space paste
it is from the brand lemonhead it's made
in Los Angeles it's really cool because
it's a Glary gel that doesn't move once
it dries on your face really nice I'm
just taking this really small Real
Techniques brush and I'm dipping in and
we're just going to be putting this
glitter focusing it towards more of the
inner corner of the eye but basically
all over the middle of the lid once
we're done with that I'm not going to
add any mascara just because I have
eyelash extensions so I don't need to
add any mascara but I do want to add a
little bit more warmth to the face and
I'm taking this it cosmetics skin that
transforming a healthy flush blushing
bronzer is really cool because you can
choose which color you kind of want so
I'm taking the a cosmetics brush and I
just kind of brush it through we're just
going to add a little bit more once to
our face I'm just putting this right
below our highlighter and then for our
lips I haven't used this shade in so
long it's by Mac it's they're kind of
sexy and matte
and I'm just going to be putting this a
little bit on the lower level and the
upper bottom
just because we're adding the loss on
top I just want to have a pigmentation
under the lips that will show through
really nicely Kylie I'm so cute gloss on
top of this again this is a little bit
of a full coverage gloss we're just
adding a little and that is the
completed makeup look I hope you guys
really enjoyed this video I love the
warm coppery eyes and a really warm
glowy dewy skin as well I hope you guys
