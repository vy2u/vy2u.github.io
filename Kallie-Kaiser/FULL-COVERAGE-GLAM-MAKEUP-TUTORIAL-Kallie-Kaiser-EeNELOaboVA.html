wanted to show you guys and make it
routine that I normally never do so we
are wearing full coverage foundation
this is a full-on glam I'm really
excited to show you guys the products
that I did use because a lot of them are
first impressions if you guys want to
follow me on my Instagram it is at Cali
Kaiser and a lot of you requested that I
couldn't change up my makeup style I
always am using the same products in a
lot of my videos and I always wear
medium coverage to light coverage
foundations because I love with my
freckles show through but I love the way
this makeup looks you guys are gonna
love it so here we go okay to start the
look I'm taking my hangover 2 face
primer I love this stuff is definitely
always been one of my G's in my makeup
routine because it's so moisturizing so
it's really good underneath full
coverage foundation but my foundation is
the buy buy foundation it is their full
coverage moisturizer I'm actually
obsessed with this this is definitely
one of the best full coverage
foundations that I've ever used and I
just use the shade fair matched me
perfect you guys can see how
moisturizing this is when I'm blending
into my face the brush I'm using is just
an it cosmetics foundation brush wow I'm
having such a hard time speak I haven't
filmed a voiceover and so long okay and
then here's me reacting to how much I
love the foundation but I'm also going
to be taking this full coverage by by
under-eye under eye concealer I love
this I'm using the shade light I have
always used this in my makeup routine
since I started using foundation a few
years ago and I thought it'd be perfect
for this look since we're going for that
full coverage dewy
glam
taking my fancy beauty contour sticks
I'm using the shade amber and in the
other one is just the portable brush
that helps blend it out I put this under
my lip on my nose I wanted to add more
to my cheekbones since this is more of a
full coverage look and when you use full
coverage foundation it's easier to blend
it out and it doesn't always look like
you have a lot on oh I love this this is
the hoola benefit quickie stick I used
to use this all the time in the summer
but I recently just got a new one I love
it
and then it blends out so seamlessly you
guys can see how great this is because
it doesn't take the foundation off
underneath leaving you with patchy skin
which is what no one wants now to set my
under eye concealer I'm going to be
taking the dermablend professional
translucent powder I did kind of a half
baking thing I normally don't wear full
coverage foundation or makeup so this is
kind of just my technique taking my Too
Faced chocolate brownie eyebrow pencil
I'm just gonna be filling in spaces that
makes my eyes eyebrows look a little bit
more filled than they really are this
product is amazing it's super nice if
you want to wear it with no makeup
because it's so natural you can kind of
see the all-over glow Vaseline texture
so I just put it on the tip of my nose
and my Cupid's bow and a little bit on
the top of my brow bone taking my it
cosmetics bye bye porous translucent
setting powder I really enjoy this
powder it's so lightweight but it really
blurs the pores you guys can see as I'm
putting it on right now so I just put it
on this morphe fluffy brush and then I
also I'm just gonna sweep away whatever
translucent setting powder I baked
underneath my eyes with to go on top of
my contour I'm taking the ambient
hourglass lighting powder in the shade
dim light this has definitely always
been one of my favorite makeup products
I've ever used as well just because it
matches my skin tone to a tee okay this
is amazing I love this product okay Cal
it is it cosmetics by my pores bronzer
it's so warm
I'm going to be mixing these two colors
undersell fluffy brush and putting that
on my apples of my cheeks as I make
these scary faces while I put it on okay
this is an OG to love the Mac oh I don't
want to forget the name of it soft and
gentle this highlighter is definitely
one of my favorites I shadow palette for
today is the Too Faced natural matte
palette I recently just got this in the
mail from them I love it and then to get
rid of that Creasy crease on my eyes I'm
using this fluffy brush from morphe and
taking that heaven shade to just set my
eyes all over the place and then for our
transition shade we're using this lace
Teddy shade same morphe brush and I'm
kind of just slopping that on my I'm not
really using a rush technique and then
for our transition shade that's a little
bit darker that we're only focusing this
on the outer corner and the inner corner
kind of creating the halo effect that I
normally do in a lot of my makeup
tutorials to darken that look a little
bit I'm taking this beached eyes shadow
palette from Urban Decay wow these
colors are actually so gorgeous I'm
taking this daybreak shade i can'ts me
today and we are just going to be
putting that on the inner corner and
outer corner of the eye just darkening
it up once again and then going in with
our highlight shade I'm taking that
second eyeshadow to color and the
palette right there and it's called
blaze just put this all with my finger
because I didn't have a synthetic
eyeshadow brush near me but I love the
way it looks the way it catches the
light it's so amazing now we are taking
this natural shade again I'm sweeping
that underneath my lower lash line this
shot freaks me out because it totally
looks like someone else is putting it
under my eye but it's just my hand
putting it on taking the shade hook up
I'm going to be sweeping that kind of
like a liner across the outer corner top
of my lash line and then I'm also
sweeping up underneath my lower lash
line that's a mouthful to say and then
for inner corner highlight I'm taking
the soft and gentle Mac highlighter I
love it
to get rid of my dry lips oh that's a
close-up shot I'm taking the lush lip
scrub and putting some chapstick on I
swear it on hold chapstick that
awkwardly but going in with my mascara
I'm taking the cush mascara by milk I
love this
cooking is everything and then taking my
cream lip stain from Sephora I'm using
the shade 115 I love this it's kind of a
satin metallic finish on my lips and it
doesn't crack or anything it's so
amazing
taking my hangover Too Faced setting
spray I'm going to be putting that all
over my face I love this stuff it always
makes my highlighter look really good a
few minutes until it dries down but that
is literally all the mega products I
