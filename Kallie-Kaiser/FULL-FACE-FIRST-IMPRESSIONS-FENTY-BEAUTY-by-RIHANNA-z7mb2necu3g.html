I'm so excited because I'm going to be
filming a full face of first impressions
I went over to Sephora and I got I
didn't get the entire fancy Beauty
Collection but I got quite a bit of
stuff and I'm really excited to get
anyways so if you guys want to follow me
on my Instagram it is just at Kylie
Kaiser otherwise you can subscribe to my
youtube channel if you haven't already
by clicking that button down below but
without further ado I would love to get
in this video so here we go okay the
first product we're gonna use is the pro
filter instant retouch primer first of
all love the packaging it's so gorgeous
and basically this is just a primer to
put underneath foundation it's smooth
pour diffusing extended makeup we're
okay so when I take it out literally
this packaging is so beautiful I love
the colors um I don't know if I'm
supposed to shake it but let's put our
hair back oh wow I love a little color
of it I'm using my mirror that's behind
the camera to apply all my makeup oh wow
it's so amazing I mean I don't know how
amazing is not but it's so sticky to put
on or like it's hard to move on the face
so it doesn't feel super tacky but it
does feel really nice and I totally
think this will work for long wear or at
least eight hours for sure I can't
really tell the difference between like
a really good primer in a really bad
primer but I think I like it but to
apply the foundation I bought the
foundation brush this is around $34 I
believe which is the same price as a
foundation why our brush is so expensive
I don't get it
okay so the foundation is medium to full
coverage long we're light is air I love
that that rhymed
again packaging so lovely I don't know
how many pumps to use so I'm just gonna
put
oh there yeah I'm just gonna do like
three pumps on my hand right now I'm
using them near behind
oh wow the brush applies this really
nicely to my skin I definitely think
it's more medium coverage or let's see
if it covers up my red spots Wow I love
makeup you look like a new person
applying it with this brush is so easy
and I'm not an expert at makeup or
anything so I don't think I'm gonna
beginner it makeup either but if you're
a beginner I feel like this would be so
easy for just anyone to apply just
before school if you're in a rush
anything like that um this is actually
my favorite type of coverage for
foundation because I love what my
freckles show through oh excuse me I
think it's so cute
okay as the foundation is drying down
when I touch my face it feels like I
have a powder foundation on it's so
light I really love it so far it totally
um looks like it's just my skin or I
think it looks like it's just my skin I
picked up the match sticks trio it has
conceal contour and highlight in it and
this says it's curated for your skin
tone magnetized for light as air
layering on the go I got the shade linen
and burn starstruck the amber looks
really really cool in the packaging
which I totally love more warm colors
for my skin tone so as I take it out I
think it is so cool they're magnetic
that is absolutely amazing that's just
brilliant packaging okay I'm gonna try
to use this match sticks linen as an
under-eye concealer when I swatch it it
should be light enough for me so I'm
just gonna try it oh wow
it's super creamy it kind of feels waxy
which I know that might maybe some
people might stay leaf if it's more waxy
I'm just highlighting the high points of
my face
I think this makeup is great for photos
so far because my skin looks so healthy
and dewy I also purchased her portable
Fenty beauty brush because I love the
idea of just like make a makeup being
easy on the go throw it on your face and
so it looks like this it's super soft I
think this was around $24 and you could
totally blend your concealer with this
too the reason I did it is cuz I'm going
to use it to blend my contour and I'm
just gonna go right in ooh it's kind of
waxy as well
I don't know this will be hard to blend
out so I'm just gonna go in and try and
blend this out right away oh just
kidding this blush this brush makes it
super easy to blend out and none of the
foundation has moved underneath the
product either which i think is a really
great quality of the makeup I think this
totally makes me look like I have
cheekbones that I totally do not have
like if I look straight in the camera
totally deceiving okay my face literally
feels like I have nothing on it which I
love that is probably my favorite so
moving on to the shade starstruck this
is the highlighter that came in the trio
set which this is so pretty and I'm
barely even touching my face
tip of my nose but I would definitely
use this again I absolutely love it and
I think the price range for this
collection is just absolutely amazing so
I bought the invisi matte blotting
powder and I did not set my under eye
concealer yet I have really dry skin so
I could totally get away without setting
under-eye concealer
okay so this is the universal and visit
matte blotting powder I love the
packaging of this I think it's so nice
and it basically just says it's an
instant refresh on-the-go filter effects
and hopefully it diminishes pores
kind of is like a blurring filter effect
and it comes with this really nice it's
a leather on one side and then this side
is more like a makeup don't know what
it's called but hopefully you know what
I'm talking about so I'm just going to
put it under my eyes
oh wow the second I put on my chin it
totally blurred that area of my face
moving on to the kilowatt freestyle
highlighter this is creamy long-lasting
and less ways to glow I am so excited to
try this on my eyes and cheeks so this
is in the shade trophy Wyatt anyone who
knows me or like follows me on my
Instagram know as my favorite color is
yellow so I'm absolutely obsessed so
this is what it looks like so I'm just
gonna swatch it on me right here I know
that's one touch it looks amazing
doing uh swatch it on you wait we're
gonna use my roommate's arm cuz we're
totally different skin tones just like
her hand goes in the frame okay hold
your arm up wait oh wait let me swatch
it oh it's so beautiful
no it won't fit I haven't fixed focus
I'm going to be taking this morphe m5a1
brush I'm just gonna go in moment of
truth
oh my gosh it's so bright what I think
it's totally supposed to be used with
the brush that she came out with but wow
this is absolutely gorgeous it's so easy
to apply
so this highlighter is absolutely
amazing the only thing is I just didn't
use the right brush to apply it I want
to see what it looks like even if you
apply it with your finger it's just so
creamy though I also want to just use
this um with my finger as an eye shadow
because I think that looks so beautiful
I picked up another highlighter this is
the free style highlighter duo it's
still kawatte and it is in the shade
ginger binge and
Samuel and I'm really excited about this
because it is so freaking beautiful so
these look like this and I'm not gonna
be putting them as highlighters I'm
going to be putting them as my eye
shadow for today so it comes with two
different shades one is just way more
extreme and metallic than the other okay
so I'm just gonna go straight in with
the less metallic shade and I'm just
putting this all over my crease as a
transition shade oh my gosh it blends
honestly so beautiful and then with my
finger I'm just going to be applying
this all over my lid that probably look
crazy right now because I have two
different color eyeshadows and two
different color highlights okay that is
probably one of my new favorite eye
looks and it literally took me two
minutes to do so the only thing left
that I have to review is the lip gloss
I'm huge about smells I want I hate the
smell of it
it smells like lip smackers huge doe
foot applicator which is absolutely
amazing oh my gosh it's so smooth
that's probably actually with my
favorite things well it is so beautiful
and it totally feels like it's not
really gonna move it kind of feels like
it's gonna stay all day um so I'm going
to tell you guys what I love rocker on
the primer I really liked the primer I
feel like you totally get away with
buying any other primer if you have a
cheaper alternative nothin like crazy
stood out to me about this primer other
than it was just really nice I think
it's going to work with everyone's skin
type so I really did like this I wish it
was a little bit more moisturizing other
than that I totally think it's worth the
amount of money that it's worth and I
think you should totally invest in it if
you are looking for a new primer and
you're kind of bored as far as the
foundation I think the foundation is
absolutely amazing I actually loved the
formula I didn't try it out with a
beauty blender only because I really dry
skin and I feel like the beauty blender
would absorb most of this just because I
think it's more of a medium coverage
foundation I totally think it's worth
$34 that's really inexpensive if you're
going to be shopping for a foundation at
Sephora the lip gloss is totally one of
my favorites I love something that looks
good on every single skin tone and it
totally looks really pretty with this
monochromatic look going on over here
I think the highlighters knock it out of
the park they're so creamy my skin looks
so good and dewy it doesn't highlight
any of my textures I love that you can
use these as eyeshadows this brush was
really nice it's super easy because it's
considered or they call it a portable
brush it's super super soft and then as
far as the contour and concealer I
personally really liked it but again I'm
not as picky as some people are it
doesn't look muddy on my face or powdery
it totally makes my skin look dewy it
depends if you're going to be putting
product on top of it and might end up
getting patchy because it kind of is a
waxy formula and then as far as the
highlighter stick I actually really
liked it it made my skin look very dewy
and fresh so I have no complaints about
that for the universal powder I actually
really like this I've never purchased a
blurring blotting powder before nice and
they did a really good job with this one
and I'm totally using
on an everyday basis but that is all I
hope you guys loved this video obviously
this makeup wow it the foundation looks
so good on my skin it doesn't even look
like I'm really wearing even though it
is a dry formula kind of matte and I do
have dry skin it totally looks fine as
long as you're moisturizing or sleeping
in mass every night your skin stays
hydrated and the phone well that
highlighter is absolutely incredible
anyways thank you guys so much for
taking the time to watch this video I
hope you loved it if you aren't
subscribed please subscribe already and
I totally think if you're looking for a
new product line to buy makeup from I
totally think you should splurge and buy
the whole collection I know there's
definitely some hits or misses that
would work for some people and work for
naught but everything really worked for
me I'm not that picky and I really love
it so I hope you guys loved this video
thank you so much for watching have a
lovely day bye love you the old boss
when you're with the old stars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
