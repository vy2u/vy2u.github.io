here we go
okay to start off my makeup look I'm
using this Smashbox 24-hour photo finish
i primer and I'm just putting this all
over my entire lid and then what is ever
leftover on my finger I'm just wiping
that under my lower lash line then I'm
taking my board shave you French accents
palette in the shade nude and I'm using
this lightish white color and I'm just
going to be packing that all over my lid
and using that as a base
I am then taking the bronzy color from
this palette on a fluffy brush and doing
long strokes and circular motions and
kind of building this into my crease
until I get it to the color I want I am
taking a small crease brush with this
sparkly brown color and I'm working that
on my upper lash line and into the
crease I also packed a bit on a fluffy
brush and blended that into my crease as
well
I'm taking my colour-pop cosmetics
millionaire and I'm just putting this
all over my entire lid I am obsessed
with colour-pop cosmetics guys oh my
gosh you have to check them out but my
favorite thing about this is how sparkly
it is with just one swipe I'm just
blending it in my crease now
for face makeup I am taking my bare
minerals bare skin pure foundation I'm
just putting that on my hand and
applying it with my foundation brush in
circular motions what's really nice
about this foundation my skin is dry to
normal to dry skin and this has coconut
oil in it so I'm really obsessed with
this
for concealer I'm just using my b√∂rje
vu French accents and I'm just taking
the concealer from the top of the
foundation bottle and just putting this
on any zits or red spots I have on my
face this month for under-eye concealer
I'm using it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
this is one of my favorites I am
actually obsessed and then I just apply
this with triangle motions with my
fingers then I'm going to set that with
this translucent powder
I'm taking my pure Cosmetics pressed
powder foundation and just applying this
lightly all over my face for extra
bronze
then I'm using my park app princess
palette and I'm just lightly blushing
the blush on my cheekbones I will then
take the bronzer from that palette and
just apply this all over my entire face
I will then blend that out with a FUBU V
brush for highlighter I am using this
colour-pop cosmetics highlighter in the
shade wisp and I'm just putting this
above my blush onto my high cheekbones
I'm using my gimme brow from benefit in
the shade light and I'm just brushing
this into my entire eyebrow
I'm taking the white from that palette
from porch a view again and I'm just
putting this on my upper brow bone I'm
taking that Brown sparkly color again
and putting this on an even smaller
crease brush and wiping this on my lower
lashline
I'm going back to my colour-pop
cosmetics millionaire eyeshadow and
