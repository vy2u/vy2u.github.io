I'm sober
not all from your list you just throw
friends it I want to look skinny thing
that's your pain but I'm not a piece of
meat some you know the night is young
so are we just gonna throw the snow and
easily get the shake I got it music
maybe just shows
oh hey guys it's Cal and for today's
video I'm really excited to share with
you because I have never really done a
fall inspired week or fall inspired
multiple outfits that you can put
together if that makes sense so I'm
really excited to share with you just
some of my favorite styles recently in
this month um everything I have in this
video is from Frankie Phoenix I don't
know if you guys have heard them or be
might be following them on their
Instagram but their clothes are amazing
and you have to check them out I will
leave a link down below in the
description box for everything also
don't forget to follow me on my
Instagram and Twitter for both social
medias it's at Cali care and then for my
snapchat if you want to follow me on
there we can need friends it's at Cali
in okay so obsessions obsessions suede
is so in so I have this suede skirt from
Frankie Phoenix and I got this in a size
too small it's so so cute it just has
buttons all the way down and they're
kind of like a brassy color or just like
bronze ito metal this fits me great it's
high waisted and it's super comfortable
and I like how it's a thick material so
you could wear this with tights or
high-waisted socks if you live somewhere
colder but um I love the pockets in the
front as well and I think just mist
photographs really great I don't know
how many of you are into the brand for
loving lemons but this bralette totally
reminds me of for loving lemons or it
has the same s going on that makes no
sense whatever but I love the lace trim
near like where it rests right here and
then it's just nude with black lace this
is a size small and it fits me perfect
the band is obviously really stretchy
too but this is so cute underneath sheer
clothes like sheer sweaters and stuff or
even just really low-cut tank tops or
t-shirts because then the lace shows
through and I think it looks so
beautiful next is this super super dope
straight it's like a baseball tee and it
buttons up as well this photographs
amazing I love it and it also has
patches on it this one says LA and this
one says blue denim special it's just
like cool back badges and I love the
stripes on this as well and if you guys
can see this don't take this off if you
guys can see it is pretty sheer so it
just hangs really really nice in the
body and it's just good to layer with I
think in general I have always wanted to
buy a bomber jacket and I'm so happy I
was able to get this one because I am
obsessed with it it's just black and
cozy and it just looks sick on I would
probably I can't wait to wear this over
Thanksgiving break and whatever it when
I go home to Chicago oh my gosh I cannot
wait to go home but I also love the
accents on this like the zipper has this
cool circle on it if you can see that
and then on the back it kind of has like
that so you can hang it up if you want
but yeah this is super cozy and I got
this one in a size small as well the
next thing I got from them is this Ridge
long-sleeve bodysuit I usually wear it
with high-waisted jeans or something but
I love anything that laces it up and so
does everybody else you should own and
check out their lace ups because they
are not that expensive and they're super
cute and this just looks really great
layered with any type of jackets or
skirts definitely sway skirts look good
with this because I've worn this
actually together before and then
high-waisted jeans are a must with like
a cute belt or something thank you guys

this video I really hope you enjoyed it
