call it like a diet or what I eat in a
day but I didn't eat enough protein in
this video to call it one myena day I
don't think I don't know but my cousins

10:55 a.m. but yeah so I'm making a
salad
she's ends up early so I'm having a
salad for lunch today this is mine okay
guys look at how delicious this looks
it's avocado goat cheese red pepper kale
cilantro cucumber and I think that is it
I'm going to add maybe a balsamic but I
made this one for me and then the
smaller one to my mom and we're going to
put this new intone balsamic vinaigrette
dressing on it and then I was cutting up
everything to put in it and then my
mom's making her normal green smoothie
with like ginger and lemon and banana
and kale on now I know what else she
puts in there but it's really good and
what are you eating right now there was
chocolate jacket Agra pretzels are you

avocado wait be careful
alright good you're gonna have that can
you can we see your cha cha cha cha
are you okay
okay so for breakfast I'm going to be
making me and my friend Peyton a really
delicious and easy parfait this is my
favorite part of a recipe it's very very
simple so first I'm just taking some
blueberries and lining a bowl and then
next we're taking some washed
strawberries and my mom gets all of our
groceries at Whole Foods so if you're
wondering like the brand or anything and
then this is my favorite yogurt Wallaby
yogurt and then we just took the vanilla
flavor and we're putting that in too I
have these like little things like ice
cream bowls or I don't know like skillet
cookie plates
I think but after you put the yogurt in
just place the strawberries right on top
and then we're going to be taking some
granola this is the brand that we use
super good and it's gluten free and
after that you're done and this actually
fills me up it's so good next we are
taking these Belgian waffles which are
so amazing you don't even need to add
syrup because they're already so sweet
and then of course some lemon water so
I'm just cutting up lemon wedges filling
some ice putting some water in and then
pop in and lemon in there that was our
finished breakfast it was so delicious
oh my gosh
