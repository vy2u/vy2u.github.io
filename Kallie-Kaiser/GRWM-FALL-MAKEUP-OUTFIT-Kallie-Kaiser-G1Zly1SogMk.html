professional into my makeup routine why
have I been using this product earlier
it's from benefit
I'm says I even put this on my face if I
don't even wear makeup that day just
because it mattifies everything it makes
it look so smooth
and then I'm taking one my favorite
primers this is the Marc Jacobs
invincible undercover um I really like
this I'm only taking about a half of a
pump just because I use the poor
professional as my main primer and then
I focus this in just areas that I
started to get splotchy with my
foundation at night to go in with the
foundation I'm using the mac matchmaster
SPF 15 foundation broad-spectrum in the
shade 2.0 since I do have a spray tan
right now that's why I'm using such a
dark color to match the rest of my body
but I do around two pumps and then a
half depending on how much I need to add
to my neck I'm going to be using my
Beauty Blender for this and I start on
my cheeks I actually really love the
coverage on this product I normally
never use anything from Mac except I
have some of their lipsticks but no it's
really not that bad of a product
it is a bit yellow I've noticed as I've
been using it but once it dries that
yellow kind of goes away and once you
add other products on top of it
translucent powder bronzer blush etc
it's not as yellow okay once I have that
all blended in I go straight for my
under eye concealer right now I'm using
the it cosmetics bye bye under-eye I'm
obsessed with their cosmetics I am use /
honderich about a year now yeah as you
guys can tell right now I'm at home it's
so nice
also I'm loving California for anyone
that is wondering living in Santa Monica
is just one of the greatest things I've
ever done and I'm never leaving
California I mean I don't know where
I'll end up but honestly I just love
California it's so pretty and then I'm
just putting this under my eyes you guys
have seen me do this so many times if
you have watched any of my previous
makeup tutorials or anything like that
okay and then I just take a super damp
Beauty Blender and we're just gonna Pat
that out then ones like one an hour just
going to go and set that I'm going to be
taking this translucent powder when I
set my under eyes I only set my under
eyes and then parts where I know I'm
going to be getting a little oily
throughout the day because my face since
I have really dry skin if I put
translucent powder all over my entire
face I look very matte and I don't
really like the look of looking very
matte for my eyebrows you know I'm a
very natural person with eyebrows so I
actually just take my gimme brow from
benefit and I feel like I resin with
that just because I'm not really super
talented on fillion eyebrows I've just
never
learned we're trying to teach myself so
I just go like that try and make some
shape with it I brush them all up and
then comb them down on the edges all
right priming our eyes using the Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer potion who
doesn't have who has is this and then
I'm taking my makeup geek Z palette this
color right here it's called Peach
Smoothie I use it as a transition shade
all the time it is so amazing guys so to
start off the look today I'm going to be
taking this a cosmetics makeup brush and
we're just going to go in I pack this on
all right above the crease and I blend
this up above so that it shows
underneath all the other colors this is
just my favorite transition shade ever
you guys need to have it I really wanted
to go for a warm look today just because
since I do have a spray tan my skin
looks better with warm colors on my eyes
then when I'm very porcelain other than
that it's fall so warm colors look a
beautiful on your eyes in fall and
winter seasons I think and then on a
morphe
seventeen brush looks like this I'm
going to be taking this color called
crumby Way right here for my Z palette I
love this I'm putting this on the outer
corner kind of pushing it into the
crease
you
and I'm going to be taking my Sigma
diffused crease brush is an e 38 and I'm
dipping it into the shade Morocco it is
so pigmented and warm I love this it's
from makeup geek as well she's going to
be putting this in the crease
then I'm going in with that first shade
that we use called Peach Smoothie and
I'm just dragging this underneath my
lower lash line then I'm taking that
shade of creme you lay and I'm focusing
it on the order outer corner under the
lower lash line most of the time if I
put two red of a color underneath my
lower lash line I look kind of sick
so I'm going to be taking this light
pink or not light definitely a dark pink
in this shade Tuscan Sun and I'm going
to be taking this one and putting it
under my eye and then to give this eye
look a little bit of glam I'm taking the
shade copper in the Kylie cosmetics
makeup pots or eyeshadow pots so I'm
just putting on the lid as you guys can
see how pretty that looks I love gold
looks with warmth on the eyes I think
it's very very pretty
for my contour I'm using this shade
called love triangle it is from makeup
geek as well and this is just a Real
Techniques brush
I like to take a little bit and drag it
along the radius of my nose so it looks
like that and then I'm going to be
taking this morphe e to brush and
buffing that out okay and then I'm
taking my Mark J chip and then I'm
taking my Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer
this is my absolute favorite bronzer
look at how big this is oh my gosh it's
amazing and I'm just using this
bareMinerals full flawless face brush
packing that on I love the warmth that
this bronzer brings to my face it looks
so good right now because I don't have
mascara on for today's highlight we are
going to be using the Laura Mercier
candle light this is an amazing mineral
powder
it's just that loose illuminating
mineral powder and it is literally the
best highlight or you can use it for
eyeshadow and then I'm also going to be
using the Becca cosmetics pressed powder
highlight in the shade opal so I'm going
to be taking opal first I'm using the
morphe and 5 110 brush I love the
natural glow of opal I think it's so
pretty I totally have like a bronzer Pat
right there
I like to bring this up my nose as well
better right on the Cupid's bow then I'm
going in with the Laura Mercier mineral
loose powder so pretty
since the mineral powder it's so intense
I'm going with my benefit roller lash
this is probably my favorite mascara
for lips I'm going to be using this
Oprah cosmetics long-lasting liquid
lipstick in the shade for sale ease I am
obsessed with this lipstick it might not
be for everyone just because it is more
bold than usual
and since we were going with a very
glowy and bronzy and warm look I wanted
to add highlighter to my lips and that
is exactly what this one does for us
okay and then to complete the makeup
look I'm just going to take the Urban
Decay all nighter makeup setting spray
okay guys this lip color is unreal over
cosmetics you killed it I'm obsessed
with this color I haven't been able to
wear with a full on face of makeup yet
just because I don't really do a lot of
full-on face makeups but I love having a
glam look like this so that's why we did
such heavy eyes contour highlight
everything liquid lip I love it
yes in the shade for sale ease
everything on my face right now link
down below description box I hope you
guys enjoyed this glam look for fall you
can wear in a day or night I love and
then let's go see what we're wearing
today for my outfit I'm wearing
high-waisted black skinny jeans from car
Mart denim I'm obsessed with these I got
them last fall for my sweater is a knit
material in a Mavi pink cream color it
is from Free People and I'm wearing it a
size small I just have it draped off my
shoulder so that my tank top underneath
can show this is from Emma and Sam it's
just a white spaghetti strap tank top
and it has a layering ladder design up
and down the chest and then for my hair
I'm just going to be wearing an
abundance pol doubt I thought it looked
really good to have my hair up with such
glam makeup and then for my shoes I am
wearing these snakeskin Sheen design
shoes from Topshop they are my favorite
booties I love them I also own them in
black and I wear those probably every
day but these are the next best thing
just because snakeskin is so in and then
my jean jacket with all the rips around
it are from is from Urban Outfitters I
thought this was a perfect go to fall
looks could be casual or fancy depending
on what you're doing but I thought this
outfit really well with my makeup as
well I love you all so so much thank you
so much for watching I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
