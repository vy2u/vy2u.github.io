we are going to be filming and get ready
a video with me I'm going to getting
ready with you guys to go to EDC which
is electric daisy carnival it is a huge
night festival in Vegas I've never been
before I'm very excited and thank you so
much to Clair all for sponsoring this
video I am so excited that Clair all
wanted to work with me and collaborate
on this video to give this look to you
guys so if you guys want to know how to
get my hair I use the Clairol color
creative hair makeup and then just a
simple crimper and then if you guys want
anonymity this makeup and my outfit then
just keep on watching and here we go or
the makeup tutorial part of this video
I'm already going to be having my
foundation and bronzer and highlighter
done off camera so if you guys are
wanting to know what kind of base I use
it I'll link the products down below
otherwise you can go back on my channel
and watch any makeup tutorials I have
previously uploaded so to focus our eyes
today I'm going to be taking any white
eyeshadow that you have going in with
our transmission shade I'm taking the
take me on vacation palette from Kylie
cosmetics and this transition shade that
I'm pointing to is so beautiful and
velvety I know it sounds weird to say
deepening this look I'm going to be
taking this darker color super warm on a
more compact morphe brush I'm just kind
of tying that around the outer corner
you guys will see me build this color up
as well going Android liner Tasha Jinan
the sunset palette I'm taking it to
darkest shades in this palette and I'm
just going to be putting that closer
into my crease I just really want to
darken this look
going back and with transition chain we
to the beginning I'm just going to be
sweeping that underneath my lower
lashline and then taking this really
pretty kind of warm Capri shade I'm
going to be putting that on my outer
corner of the lower lash line and then
I'm going in with this gorgeous shimmer
shade from the sunset palette and I
don't want to go crazy because I always
do shimmery looks next going in with my
lemonhead glitter pot this stuff is
amazing mine is in the shade dirty penny
ugly look at how gorgeous it is oh my
gosh so these are super intense I'm only
going to be putting a small amount on
someone near my inner corner of the eye
so that is the finished look
for eyeshadow going in with our lips I'm
taking this Bobby Brown huge jumbo art
stick in the shade bear and I'm not
completely covering my entire lips in
this and kind of just dabbing the
product on to top off the look I'm
taking my Dior lip Maximizer lip gloss
in the shade of six I love this stuff
I'm only putting it on my lower bottom
lip for setting spray this stuff is
amazing it's the preppin set from morphe
once you guys do that the makeup is
finished again if you want to know what
foundation base I use everything will be
with down below moving on to the hair
part of the tutorial I'm going to be
taking the Clairol color Craig's hair
makeup this stuff is amazing this is in
the shade shimmering copper so Clairol
is going to be empowering you guys to
flaunt your fearless and experiment with
this instant shimmering color the color
great hair makeup is a washable hair
makeup so you're able to get the look
that you want without changing your
natural hair color which I just think is
so amazing because there is no
commitment required you could just wash
it out with one shampoo so as you guys
can see I just take the product out of
the package I'm going to be swatching it
on my finger and how gorgeous is that
shimmer shade there are actually six
shades
total in the collection so this is the
brilliant Ruby shade and then I also
have a brilliant amethyst shade
with me and then this is just what the
three shades look like next to each
other I'm going to be swatching them all
for you guys on my hair so first you're
just going to take the product shake it
up-uh through the tap and what's really
nice it already has a sponge as the
applicator you can just swipe it on your
hair data on your hair it applies so
easy
they're infused with 3d micro crystals
so that is what is temporarily bonding
to the hair surface and coating each
strand to create that intense two subtle
colour effects that we see and what's so
amazing this shows up on all hair types
and textures even the darkest shades it
really doesn't matter what's also really
amazing it has no ammonia no peroxide
and no parabens in it which i think is
really important when we're putting
stuff on our hair in order to set the
color on your hair you have to take a
blow dryer heat set the shades which is
so simple you just take a blow dryer and
the shades will literally be
non-transferable you can sleep on a
white pillowcase and that color is not
going to come off as you guys are
wanting to buy it it is available at CVS
Target and chlorella home in order to
get the look that I'm doing today I'm
just going to be starting off by
brushing my hair out and then I'm going
to be taking my three waves barrel
crimper you could achieve really simple
crimps by sweeping in french braids or
sleeping in braids whatever works best
for your hair type this is what it's
going to look like as the finished
product before I add some braids in I
actually do not know how to French braid
it is the most frustrating thing ever so
my older sister is adding two cute
French braids on top of my head for me
one processor finished my braids this is
what they look like I think they're so
cute perfect for a festival or everyday
look doesn't matter so in order to apply
the color crepe hair makeup you're just
going to shake up the product and then
just literally swipe it onto your braids
or wherever you're wanting to apply the
product it is so simple if you guys are
wanting to buy the color crepe hair
makeup you can get it at CVS Target or
on Clairol compeers as a close-up shot
you guys can see how pigmented the
product is what's super cool is if you
follow Clairol color on instagram for
more ways to flaunt your fearless with
in new color created hair makeup you can
actually share your look with the
hashtag blonde you're fearless
which i think is amazing so then i'm
just going to be taking my blow-dryer
and setting the color into my hair and
once you're done blow-drying and setting
the color this is what it looks like I
am honestly so impressed with how good
it looks and it's so pigmented what's
really nice is if you run your hand
across your hair it doesn't feel like
there's anything there it just feels
like your natural hair so it's still
super soft and silky I'm so happy that
this product just gives me the freedom
to blow my fearless for tonight at EDC
I'm so excited so here's just a before
and after shot of what my hair looks
like then moving on to show you guys my
outfit I'm going to be wearing a full-on
camo jumpsuit it is from dolls kill I am
asking if such that it also has some
shimmering effects in it which is so
cool because the Clairol hair makeup
also shimmers especially in the Sun
which is so cool and the hair makeup
matches my eye makeup which I've got
food obsessed with and that is how I
found the perfect shade for me I hope
you guys love this look I'm so excited
for EDC and if you're wondering my
jewelry is from I'll have it linked down
below in the description box for you

time for this video and if you loved it
