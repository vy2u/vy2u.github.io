video I'm so excited because I'm finally
filming a Halloween video it's kind of
sad I haven't filmed one yet just
because I absolutely adore Halloween but
this year I never invested in a costume
or I'm not very good at creating
costumes for Halloween I wanted to be
Harley Quinn but everyone's being Harley
Quinn so I was like can't be Harley
Quinn but I got invited to a last-minute
Halloween party and I thought this is a
perfect video idea for a gate ready
video with me so I basically just thrown
a wig and this is this is the result so
you got my arm just cracked you guys can
basically come up with whoever you want
me to be um but I will be posting a
picture on my Instagram of this look so
if you guys want to follow me on there
is just a Kelly Keizer but without
further ado I'd love to show you guys
how I've recreated this and here we go
since I already had makeup on today you
can use your normal foundation base I'm
just gonna go straight from my eyes and
I'm setting my eye primer with the shade
plum smoke from the Laura Mercier eye
art artist palette I love this palette
it's amazing and I'm just setting that
to use as a white base for our eyeshadow
then I'm going in with a great
transition shade called fresco I love
this I think the color is amazing then
I'm using kir royal to put in the crease
and in my inner corner to just darken up
the look since I'm gonna be wearing a
purple wig I wanted to do somewhat of a
purple sparkly smokey eye so we're just
gonna recreate that then I'm taking the
darker shade in the palette called
violet ink I love this color and I'm
just really deepening my eye socket I'm
putting this on in a really messy way
just so that my eye sockets look very
dark and deathlike but still Glenn at
the same time then I'm just taking
applicant violet and sweeping that
underneath my lower lash line
now I'm taking the laura mercier loose
candle lit powder I absolutely love this
stuff it's like an illuminating
highlighter and it looks so good all
over the eyes and then I'm just taking
my normal gimme brow from benefit and I
just sweet my eyebrows all the way up
and then I sweep them across and then
brush them down I do really need to get
them done they do not look cute
for my bronze I'm taking the tantric
Marc Jacobs Oh mega bronze I love this
stuff and I'm just taking that on my
contour brush and contouring in the
places that I want to slim down the
reason why I didn't use a contour color
is because I like how it looks weird
with the really really warm against my
pale skin I thought it was good for
Halloween then I'm just taking a bigger
fluffy brush and putting that on my face
where it needed it more
or highlighter I'm taking the laura
mercier illuminating candle lit loose
powder i love success with this guys i
just think it's so soft and pretty
and I thought it looks great for this
look and then for lips I'm taking the
Pat McGrath lust o4 cream lipstick in
the shade one I'm obsessed with this
color I think it's really great for any
skin tone as well I did a review on
these lip kits and I'm absolutely in
love with them they come as glitter and
you can apply that on top of the cream
so I'm actually going to be putting this
on my eyes as well I love putting any
lip products on my eyes I think it looks
really cool even though that sounds so
weird so we're just packing this on in
the middle of our eye and then we're
actually going to be putting the glitter
on top of that as well and I thought
this look looks so good in between the
dark purple colors let me put in our
crease and then I'm just taking whatever
is left over on the brush and smudging
that into the crease blending the
glitter into my eye and then we're just
going to repeat that process and apply
it right on our lips then I'm taking my
all-time favorite roller lash from
benefit this is my favorite mascara ever
I love it and the ones you guys finish
that you can add eyeliner cat eye
wherever you want to make this look
darker more intense but that is eight I
wanted to keep it glam but purpley at
the same time so that's what we did and
then I just got this wig for ten dollars
at the closest Halloween store to my
apartment because I didn't know what
else to do with my life
for my outfit I'm wearing this amazing
jacket I'm obsessed it's sparkly and has
fringe on it is from Planet blue and
then my dress is from show me your
muumuu it's just a side tank top slip
dress and then for my jewelry tonight
I'm just wearing my simple choker
necklaces that I always wear from Lilly
clasp I would love them
and then my fishnets are from Nasty Gal
and my high top bits or over-the-knee
boots I guess you could call them are
from forever 21 I got these last fall
and I wear them almost every day I love
them but that is it for today's video
thank you guys so much for watching I
love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
