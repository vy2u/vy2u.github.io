when I get out of the shower I'd love to
take a little bit of lavender it's
essential oil and it's so calming I
think it's one of the most beautiful
scents ever and I like to dab a little
trees my nose so I can kind of smell
with throughout the day if it stays
there since I am crazy dry skin I have
to go right in to moisturize my face and
I taste the confidence and cream by a
cosmetics this stuff is life-changing
love the way it feels on my skin I also
take some vitamin E oil and I drip a
little on my list because I get pop
blood vessels and then promotion I take
the Brazilian bumbum cream this stuff is
amazing because when it dries and you're
in the Sun or something there's a little
glitters all over your body so I should
be good I put this everywhere I also
take the OL Henriksen true serum holy
crap this stuff is absolutely amazing
Cleo's do a drop and I start off into my
neck then you row this an all over so
you think lengua wet lips I always let
my hair air dry unless I'm going to an
event or something so I take my no not
buy original mineral and I just sprayed
this in my hair
I also use a little bit of the
nourishing coconut oil and it's the
hydrating oil mist not a weird dress I
keep all of my makeup up here I don't
really wear a lot of makeup during the
day I like to keep it very dewy and
natural the first thing I put on my face
is the piece of hair dr. jart color
correcting treatments this is probably
one of my favorite products on the
planet Earth because it takes away any
redness I have it is almost like I'm
wearing a clear foundation it also has a
broad-spectrum 30 in it which is really
good because you always wear sunscreen
I'm using the glossary boy brow in
blonde
I love how natural this look and then I
take my crochet clot equate I have no
idea Casas it's the Y it's all radiant
touch and I'm just going to be putting
it underneath my eye a little I have a
very veiny eyelid I like to put this on
my eyelids as well it really brightens
up my skin and then I take a little bit
of my Benetton from benefit I've been
using this for so many years it just
breathe natural wants into my face do
you do drops and I do a very small
amount because this stuff is so amazing
and gorgeous so you have to use a very
small amount otherwise too much and it
just brings a gorgeous highlight to my
skin and put on the to my ends Cupid's
bow and then a lil on-island
and then I'm taking the Chanel lip gloss
in the shade I see this doe foot
applicator is the softest thing I have
ever put on my lips at the moment these
two are my favorite necklaces I have
just been wearing them every single day

you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
