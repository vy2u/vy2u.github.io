I'm really excited I filmed a makeup
tutorial and miss you guys I feel like I
haven't filmed in quite a bit college is
just intense so um I filmed this makeup
look I'm really obsessed with super dewy
super fries perfect holiday glam also I
got my Instagram back you're gonna
follow me on there it's just a Kelly
Keizer but without further ado I'd love
to show you guys this look so here we go
to start the makeup look I'm just gonna
be taking my hangover 2 face primer I
love this primer it's so good I do about
two pumps and I lately have been
applying my primer with just a flat
brush so this one is the Sigma
foundation f60 brush there's no specific
reason why I do this when I get my
makeup done they sometimes apply my
primer like this and I just like it
better okay once I'm just done blending
in my primer all over my face and once
it's kind of soaked in I have found the
best foundation I've ever used in my
entire life it is the all ours
foundation by YSL and I am not kidding
you this foundation is absolutely
amazing you guys are gonna love the way
your skin looks when you use it and then
I'm using the Dior eighteen brush I just
picked this up at Sephora it's perfect
for buffing foundation in when I apply
this I personally just put a little on
my face
I am so excited to go home for the
holidays I'm literally screaming inside
right now I'm so excited just because I
love the Midwest so much I'm from
Chicago not the city suburbs area and I
can't wait I'm so excited I use my
foundation as my eye primer so I kind of
just practice on what I live okay once
our foundation is all blended in also my
nails I recently got them done I never
get my nails done so I'm really happy so
once our foundation is all blended I
kind of just let it sit on my face for a
second before I contour because I don't
want to wipe away any of the foundation
I want it to sit on my skin and you guys
can already just see how amazing this
foundation looks like so literally looks
like my skin I love it so beautiful he's
put on some lip gloss so my lips don't
dry out so I'm just gonna go in with my
eyebrow so I'm using the gimme brow from
benefit um this is not my shade it
actually ran out of the boy brow in my
shade and I love boy brow but I'm just
gonna apply a little of this I'm going
to be taking my by Terry concealer I
have the shade 2 and vanilla beige and
I'm just taking a little bit and I'm
just going to apply this with my finger
I've been really into dewy fresh skin
looks lately so to set my eyes I'm
taking the Charlotte Tilbury airbrush
flawless finish skin perfecting micro
powder just setting my eyelids okay once
I set my lids my foundation has soaked
into my skin so I'm going in with the
Fenty beauty contour stick in the shade
amber and I'm just blending it out with
their portable brush they have that
comes with I love this I wear it every
single day it looks so good
I put out my nose too
I like that you can kind of just throw
it on your face and you don't have to
try it all so then I just go and blend
that out right away and then I blend my
nose in
I never used to use this I've had this
for like eight months and I never used
to use it because when I wouldn't use it
with a brush it was too pigmented on my
face almost and now I apply with my
fingers and it works so good after I'm
done applying highlighter with my finger
I will then go in with the hourglass
ambient lighting powder in the shade dim
light I love this stuff and I'm just
gonna go in with this Sigma large powder
a thirty brush so this side I just
applied it
and then for our bronzer i'm using the
becca sunlit bronzer in bali sands i
love this it's so beautiful it's kind of
shimmery but it doesn't really show up
on your face and this is my favorite
bronzer brush ever it's the morphe and
five to seven and done
oh wait we should add some blush so for
blush I'm going to be using the NARS
man-ray
in the shade intensity okay when I show
you this color you're gonna be like what
so pretty it's so 70s so I kind of just
taking some on the brush I wipe off any
extra on my hand I think it's so cute
that's all I add is the perfect amount
if you ever find any spots or like not
fully blended out yet Aki blended my
concealer in with my finger I always
love to take my artiste brush in the
oval 6 the elite one and I also blend
foundation in with this too I absolutely
love it it kind of just puts the makeup
in its place okay for eyeshadow today my
transition shade is going to be the
ambient lighting power hourglass in the
shade dim light okay taking my Sigma
tapered blending I'm gonna be going in
with the fenty Beauty kilowatt
highlighter thingamajigger in the shade
ginger binge in Moscow Mule this is so
amazing it looks like this and I'm just
going in with this shade because this is
gonna be like our main transition only
using a few colors find that I love just
single eyeshadow color it looks
then focusing most of it towards my
outer corner I'm just gonna go in with
the main shade I'm using the elf aqua
beauty little palette right here they
use are so cool I believe this color
that's the color that we're gonna be
using today these are like putty they
like move around it's like putty so
we're using this color it's so pretty
and I'm just gonna go in and put it
right on my lid
so to show you guys really really out
close this is what the eye is looking
like so once we do that you're just
gonna want to sweep some shadows
underneath your lower lash line so I'm
just gonna go and take my bronzer that I
used in my face which is the Becca in
valley sands and I'm taking this small
baby Sigma pencil and a 30 I'm taking me
Natasha to know in the palette 5 and the
number 4 I know that seems confusing but
that's just what it's called and I'm
taking this gorgeous color right here
just for the inner corner highlight
so I'm really upset moving on to our lip
I can't find one of my favorite lip
liners we're just going to use my other
favorite lip liner and this one is the
portray vu French accents lip liner in
naked and we're kind of just going to
over draw our lips lately I've just been
wearing lip liner and gloss and I love
the way it looks I blend it all with my
finger I'm taking the foolosophy a lip
gloss I put this in my favorites video a
little bit ago I love it so beautiful
okay here is the finished makeup look I
love the way it turned out its
foundation mmm I love it so much it's so
amazing but I hope you guys have a
lovely day thank you for watching hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
