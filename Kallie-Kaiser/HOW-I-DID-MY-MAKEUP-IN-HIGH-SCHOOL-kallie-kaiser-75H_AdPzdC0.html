video I'm going to be doing me how I did
my makeup in high school challenge these
challenge videos look amazing I don't
know who started it but shout out to
whoever started it I've watched a few
and I'm totally inspired just because my
makeup was horrid I knew nothing about
makeup
probably from seventh and eighth grade
in middle school to freshman to the end
of sophomore year I didn't even wear
foundation until I graduated high school
so I'm really excited to share with you
guys the makeup I used to put on my face
and here's the video of me eighth grade
wearing makeup and then here's a video a
video a picture and then he was a
picture of me sophomore your high school
wearing makeup um I used to have banks
you can only see my eyes we can see my
blush going on it's just so embarrassing
these photos are hysterical so without
further ado here we go sensitive work on
nation I should take my concealer and I
would stick my nails inside of concealer
so that I would come out like this on my
nail like I would scoop it with my nails
so weird and I would just only put this
under my eyes like so with my finger I
would just go like this and then I do
the other eye and sometimes this
concealer wouldn't even match my face
I'd go in I take more and I'd put it
wherever I had zits or I thought they
were into my face and I was just down
about like this and I would leave
blotches of concealer just stuck on my
face so bad this she doesn't even match
me now I would dab it out like this
until it looks like that it would match
my skin tone and then after I would add
that in my face I would take any loose
foundation powder like this so I went to
Walgreens and I got the L'Oreal True
Match I used to use a different powder
but I couldn't find it at the store so I
would just take this use this as my
foundation for coverage and I would just
go at it with a huge powder brush and
just conceal my whole face and make it
really dry looking in powder I don't
know why I like that look but I loved it
and I would add way more powder
needed and it would always be paler than
mice normal skin color because I loved
that look my worst fear
when I was younger is to be a cake face
it was literally my worst fear um so I'd
always make sure that whatever powder I
would have would be two shades lighter
than my actual face so I would have a
pale cake face the coverage on this is
actually pretty good I'm not lying
look at my face but I would literally
pack this on for maybe five minutes
until I felt I was covered enough and
then once I would do that I would go for
my eyeshadow and I never used any eye
primer anything with that or I would
never use brushes for eyes so I would
just go in with a random eyeshadow
palette I think I used to use a version
of the Too Faced when I was in sophomore
year of high school so today we are
going to dive in and I would always take
a white shade first just right with my
finger and I would go in go in and just
put it on my eye
just really messy I remember I literally
remember doing this getting ready for
school in the morning and then I would
take in whatever color I wanted next
which I usually would use a light pink
color and put it in the middle and then
on the outside I would do a brown or a
purpley brown color so here I would just
put out my finger like this and dab it
out in the corner just like this I can't
believe I'm putting makeup on with my
fingers right now it feels so weird
once I would blend all that in I would
take a black color I went through really
dark eye stages and I would take a black
color and just dab it on my finger and I
put it on my lid and I'd smear it on the
lid but I love the look of smeared
mascara so I tried to do that effect to
my eyes and I'd put it right on top of
the light pink weirdest thing ever I
know this is so funny to do because I
would do this and I'm like oh my gosh
this looks amazing and I would smear it
so that it looked like smeared mascara
once I was done smearing on my lid I
would look up at what's ever left my
finger out smear it underneath what's so
weird I vividly remember wearing my eyes
like this in 8th Grade and I love the
way it looks because I thought it made
my blue eyes pop so that's why I would
smear black around my eyes because I
thought it looked so good and then I
would take umm if you have any liquid
liner I would do the thinnest line of
liquid liner on the top line the top
and then after I was done lining the top
I would go in with any other black dry
liner I used to put liner on my
waterline super aggressively and I would
never do it all the way in the corner
because black stuff will get caught in
the corners and I would never put it
over this I'd only put it from here over
and then same on this side oh my gosh
this is hysterical
my friends got me addicted to putting
silver glitter on the lining of my top
lash line we should get it a Victoria's
Secret it was the best it was our
favorite we used to add silver Lions
glitter and we'd wear to school all the
time because we thought it made our eyes
sparkle so I went to the drugstore and
this is all the one I could find and I
would just line right above my black
with silver glitter it used to be way
more intense than this - which is so
funny I never wore bronzer I would only
wear blush because I thought bronzer was
only for people who were originally tan
and since I was so pale I was like oh I
can't wear bronzer because I look like a
cake face because I was so scared of
being cake face this is the blush that I
actually used to use it is my mom's old
Mac bra blush I stole it from her
cabinet oh my gosh should I just get
glitter up here oh there try it so just
take any brush and as you guys can see
the pink is kind of carved out because I
would try it and use the brush only in
the pink part because I love the pink
color but I would literally just go like
this right on the apples of my cheeks
I would never shake off the brush or
anything I just go at it like this and
then for mascara my friends and I would
all try and get the Columbia slash as
ever so I'll go up down up down up down
up like this you can get a lot of
mascara on there because I love love the
way it looks which I would never do this
now and I used to put so much on the
bottom lash and then for my lips I used
to put on tinted moisturizers or tinted
chapstick I couldn't find the brint I
couldn't find the one that I used to use
but I know I have it back in my house in
Chicago it was the most interesting red
color it would make my lips super tinted
but in junior year and senior year I
used to wear pink Pat pink plaid to
school from Mac so I'm just gonna put on
a little of this cuz I never would wear
a full color of lipstick because I
thought it was too much this is my
finished makeup look on what I would
wear to school mostly in eighth grade
and freshman year I used to wear my
makeup like this and then I definitely
toned down a bit but I was definitely
into black smokey eyes and the glitter
all across the top liner I loved a love
that look and then I used to have bangs
but when I didn't have bangs I used to
wear my hair to the parts on this side
and I would swoop it over like this so
that I look like this at school and I
used to literally wear my hair like this
and this was Who I am
you guys so much chickens on for this
video please subscribe to my channel and
comment down below what kind of makeup
you used to do when you were in high
school or middle school or whenever you
