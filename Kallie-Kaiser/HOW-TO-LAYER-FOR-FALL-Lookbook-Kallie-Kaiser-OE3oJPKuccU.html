I'm so excited because I'm working with
misguided
I love misguided I think they are so
badass I love everything they stand for
anyone who hasn't shopped with misguided
before they are a UK brand but they have
a u.s. website now which is really cool
everything I am wearing this video is
from misguided so I will leave a link
down below description box for
everything and that I am wearing this is
gonna be more of a fashion inspired
lookbook so many of you guys have you're
requesting more videos like these so
there you go and I can't wait to show
you guys how I layer for fall and then
there's a fun going out outfit at the
end so I'll show you guys in a sec here
we go
okay to start the base of this leg
outfit I'm taking this amazing black
turtleneck mesh bodysuit this is so bond
everyone needs it in their closet as a
staple to layer underneath
I just paired that with really cute
black high-waisted frayed skinny jeans
and then I'm wearing these awesome
corked heels that are pointed toe
booties to add warmth and layer on top
of the mesh I'm just taking this amazing
camel thick sweater I like how it shows
my shoulders and it looks really good
with the black jeans I then just threw
on this really simple gold belt that I
thought carried nice with the sweater
and then since obviously it is a fall
and winter season look I just added this
amazing wool rider jacket from his
guided and I got a size before in this
for the next layering look we're wearing
the same black mesh bodysuit and skinny
jeans I just changed up the shoes but
for this we're going to add a sweatshirt
on top this is super cute because it has
a cutout v-neck and it almost has a
choker like designer on the neck because
it's cut out in that way and I thought
this was fun it looks really good if you
roll up the sleeves to show more of the
mesh hidden underneath and then I'm
wearing these super sick crushed velvet
black sandals heels these are super
comfortable and they kind of look really
chic with the mesh going on
this layering look is definitely for one
of those warmer days but I just took
this really simple black and white
striped cami with this lace detailing on
the top and these are the sickest
boyfriend jeans ever I love the fit of
them also those jeans look sick if you
layer any sort of tights underneath them
but for this look I added this cute
two-tone bomber jacket it's more of a
satin material and it's really
lightweight so you can always layer a
really cool winter coat on top and then
I'm wearing those same black corpse
boots with this look
oh okay this dress gives me life
I'm obsessed is the perfect shade of
yellow I normally don't wear yellow but
I'm in love this dress is the perfect
length it has a zipper in the back and a
beautiful cowl-neck in the front
I'm just pairing that with these amazing
crushed velvet booties I like how they
go up a little more on the calf and
normal booties and then the heel part is
metallic silver and if you want to spice
up the look or you're feeling yourself
just add some layered fishnet tights
underneath and they look really cute
with the booties and the dress all
together I think this is a perfect fall
going out look especially if you add a
really sick jacket thank you guys so
much for picking us out to watch this
video it really means a lot to me I love
you all so much and I love reading your
s comments so leave a comment and all
coming back I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
