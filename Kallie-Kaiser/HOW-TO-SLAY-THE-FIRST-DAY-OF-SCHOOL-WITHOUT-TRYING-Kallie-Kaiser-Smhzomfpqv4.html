video I'm basically going to be showing
you guys how you can play the first day
at school without even trying I hope you
guys really loved this video if you want
to know how to get my makeup my hair or
outfit then just keep on watching and if
you want to follow me on my Instagram
it's just a catalyzer and you could
subscribe to my youtube channel if you
just click the button down below I love
you but yeah I'm really excited about
this video and I hope you guys love it
so here we go okay start off with makeup
I literally just exploited the crap out
of my face so that's why it's so red I
didn't screw up really hard I just have
really sensitive skin but for our primer
this is probably when my favorite
primers ever it is the Too Faced
hangover primer smells really weird but
the smell goes away like right away once
my foundation on top of it I think about
this much and I put this all over my
skin this makeup I'm about to show you
guys is the easiest technique ever I'm
literally just taking my it cosmetics
what would you call this a kabuki I
don't know it's like a flat flattop
puffing foundation brush perfect and I
actually squeezed my foundation on the
back of my hand I'm using meat forever
Dior holy cow this stuff is folded I do
about two pumps this is makeup for
beginners I promise so I take a little
bit you guys can just see how gorgeous
that foundation is right when I blend in
I like to do circle motions or you can
like sweep it across your face this
brush is really really amazing so it
really doesn't matter how you apply it I
also put foundation on my eyelids I use
that as an eye primer I don't have a
separate product as an eye primer
a human foundation is so good for school
too because I love all my freckles show
through my foundation and I love that
this one does I'm not actually going to
use under-eye concealer because this is
my makeup that I use for school and I'm
really not trying I wanted to move a
little bit closer I mean focus okay I
wanted to move a little bit closer so
you guys can see how I do my contour so
after our foundation is all blended I
literally take the hoola kwikki contour
stick oh my I forgot to push it up all
the way don't do that and I will
literally just do one swipe one swipe
done this all I do and I take this
multi-purpose Sephora I got at the end
checkout and I literally just buff this
into my skin and it makes it look like
it's airbrush and it's so creamy I love
the way this looks when it's all blended
out and then beginners can do this it's
so simple and then I'm taking my
Charlotte silvery air blot airbrush
flawless finish skin perfecting powder
this stuff is amazing I literally just
sweep this wherever I want my face and
what's really nice you could just put
this in your book bag bring it to school
smile lines I cover them up and then I
set my eyelids for that not for
foundation for eyeshadow I normally
don't set my entire face but at school
it so you have a test and you're
stressed out you're going to want to set
your entire face I then go in with
bronzer and I am taking the hoola
benefit bronzer this stuff is amazing it
is the hoola light and i'm using the
morphe m-52 seven brush one of my
absolute favorites because it contours
your face with you it contours your face
for you and you don't have to do any
work I also just wipe this across my
forehead and nose to cystic technique
and then for my nose I literally just
squeeze the brush and go like this let
me just go underneath the lower lip too
and for blush today I'm using the it
cosmetics confidence in your glow this
is really cool because I literally take
the brush that comes with it I do one
swipe shake it off I have been really
into blush lately I think it's so cute
and today I'm using the Oprah cosmetics
Rodeo Drive with a Sephora fluffy fan
brush and I lightly lightly put this on
my face at school you can put as much
highlighter on as you want but you don't
want to distract kit from getting good
grades if you need to keep it minimized
and then it's like The Naturalist glow
ever I also like to add to some my eyes
before we do eyeshadow for our eyeshadow
today I'm using the new honest Target
Beverly Hills subculture palette I
really haven't played around with this I
don't know what to expect but I'm going
to be using this as the transition shade
on a fluffy brush like so this is the
morphe e 20 7 and we're putting this
color just all over I and in the crease
but I'm going to be going in with this
Sigma pencil in the number 30 and I'm
going back in with that dawn color and
just bringing it underneath my lower
lash line and then that's for my inner
corner highlight I like to go back in
with my highlighter and we just put that
in the inner corner I'm taking the YSL
eye duo smoker in the shade 4 and I like
to take this side of it ah it's kind of
a dark ish purpley and I'm just putting
this on my waterline because I think it
darkens up the look a little bit it's
super creamy so it blends and really
nice I sometimes even go over that with
my brush and it kind of just takes off
any products that I don't really want on
there okay for mascara I'm taking the
Montse or big Lancome Lancome mascara
this is currently my favorite really not
the best at putting mascara on for lips
today I'm using this color pop in the
shade fairy floss and it is one of their
lip glosses and I love a good nude lip
gloss and then the last step I take a
setting spray I like to use be morphe
prep and set because it has a continuous
sprayer you don't have to continue to
pump something I can never tell if I'm
in focus okay this is the completed
makeup look I hope you guys love it I
would definitely wear this to school
when I was applying this you guys
totally saw me kind of just throw all
these products on my face and it really
looks amazing so this makeup is totally
for beginners if you're not really
experienced with foundation it's totally
fine I love the way it turned out it's
kind of smoky on the lower lash line and
I love the color in my cheeks but I
can't wait to show you guys how I paired
this makeup with an outfit for school so
here we go
moving on to show you guys my outfit for
today I really wanted to show you guys
that you can look bomb AF with literally
no effort at all so I'm just taking a
basic white teeth 100% cotton and it's
from the brand redone I am obsessed I
wear it way too much underneath it I
just have a white Urban Outfitters
sports bra and then I paired it with
these sick jeans they definitely steal
the show but again I really didn't try I
just put a pair of jeans on the detail
on these are so sick it is from the
brand of ragged priests most comfortable
jeans ever and then for my shoes you
could totally pair this outfit with a
bomb pair of booties but I just decided
to go with in Nikes I love the red white
and blue I have been wearing these all
the time and they look adorable with
these white socks I will link the socks
down below the description box I get
them on Amazon I'm obsessed with them I
probably wear them with every tennis
shoe ever
but yeah and then for my hair I really
just threw my hair up in a simple pony
again no effort in this video I really
didn't try hard I just put a ponytail my
hair and then jewelry makes the outfit
personally what I think accessorizing my
jewelry is from Adina's jewels and then
my earrings are really hot but yeah you
can also pair a bomb Jack with this
outfit if you want I hope you guys loved
it
again this is how to slay the first day
of school with not trying at all thank
you guys from the bottom of my heart for
watching this video it really means the
world to me I can't wait to respond to
all your comments and read them all I
hope you guys have a lovely day and an
amazing first day of school bye love you
and missed the camera
