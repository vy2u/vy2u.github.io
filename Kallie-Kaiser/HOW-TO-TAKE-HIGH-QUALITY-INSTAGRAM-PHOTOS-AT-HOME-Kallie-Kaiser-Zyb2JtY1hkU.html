really excited because I'm just gonna be
showing you guys how I take my high
quality Instagram photos at home and
it's so simple you guys can do it too
so I normally just go against a white
wall I'll get into the details of like
the camera I use and my lighting once I
start the video but if you guys want to
follow me on my Instagram it is just at
Kelly Kaiser I'm gonna be showing you
guys three editorial looks and how I
shoot them and then I'll show you guys
how I edit some of my Instagram photos
at the very end of the video but without
further ado here we go okay for my first
look here is the top I'm just gonna be
shooting from probably here up and I am
so obsessed with that I'll have it
linked down below I love it so much and
then for my makeup I just decided to do
super glowy bronzy dewy skin luck and
then I don't know if you guys can see my
eyes but I kind of highlighted them with
some shimmers and stuff and then did
super glossy lips so you guys can see my
makeup a little bit better I wanted to
show you how it looks in the Sun so
these are the vibes that we're going for
here is what my setup looks like I just
have a traditional ring light right here
my camera with a tripod and then I sit
on this stool you can stand or sit on
the floor it honestly doesn't matter for
my ring light I got this on Amazon I
think it was around 70 or 80 bucks
I'll have it linked down below for you
guys I think lighting is everything but
my camera also has an additional flash
that goes off so here's my camera I have
the Canon EOS Rebel t5i and I use a
sigma 30 millimeter F one point-four
lens and I do have it on auto focus at
the moment for this video I will be
taking my photos with my professional
camera but if you don't have a
professional camera or you don't have
one that you could borrow from a friend
or a family member then you can
definitely still use your iPhone or
whatever phone device that you have on
self-timer
it still works and also with this ring
light you can also buy attachments where
you could set your phone up here or my
camera for example when I'm about to
take some photos to my Instagram I just
turn my camera on make sure it's in the
creative Auto setting as it says right
here this is just how I take my photos
there could be a better way but this is
just how I do it and then I want the
flash be on at all times so I make the
flash go on
and then I also make sure it's on
ten-second timer which it already is
awesome and then I hit this button up
here to have the viewfinder be able to
flip out and that way I can see myself
and how I'm posing against the wall in
order for me to take a photo I just
pressed my face
lean back really quickly against the
wall so it focuses in and then the timer
automatically will go off and then
here's what I see using the viewfinder
so I'm able to see how I look and how
I'm posing and what kind of vibes I want
and then it takes and it looks like that
so I'm gonna take a few photos I'm gonna
edit them and then I'll show you what it
looks like and how the outcome looks and
show you how easy it is to take amazing
photos at home
okay here's the second look I'm so
excited to shoot in this sweater I love
it so much so we have some rainbow Gucci
vibes my sweaters from the ragged priest
and then for my makeup I really wanted
to do a warm smokey eye with black
eyeliner so that's exactly what I did
here is just what my makeup looks like
and then for my hair it's just bad head
this is how I woke up this morning but I
added a cute braid and then for my
background I thought it would be so cool
to manipulate it so I just added some
blue tissue paper to the wall and it's
only gonna be on half so I'm probably
gonna sit in the middle right there
you
okay and then here's my third look I
really wanted to do something natural
just to show you guys that you really
don't have to wear any makeup to come up
with cool Instagram photos so I am just
wearing a tinted chapstick I use it as
blush too it's just from it cosmetics
it's their rose tinted chapstick I love
this stuff and then I put a little bit
of highlighter on my cheekbones and in
my inner corner so here's what my outfit
looks like for the third look I really
want to have this peek open to show all
the jewelry all my jewelry is either
from Lele class or fawn star glasses are
from Lambert's store and my jacket is
Urban Outfitters
okay to show you guys how I edit my
Instagram photos it's super easy I only
use two apps I use facetune and visco in
that order so the first thing that I do
on facetune is when I open the app I
obviously open a photo that I'm gonna
edit okay so I click on the photo that
I'm gonna edit obviously first thing
that I love to do is I go in with the
smooth tool and I smooth on my lower jaw
kind of near my smile line and just like
little dots on my forehead and then
after that I take the detailing tool and
I detail my lips my highlight on my
cheeks the tip of my nose and then if my
eyes were showing I usually detail my hi
so I'm just gonna detail the sunglasses
I'm gonna detail my jewels and then once
I go to filters I hit lighting and I
always hit lighter I usually bring this
up to around 85
and then there's another really cool
thing on here that a lot of you guys ask
how I do I go to lens and it's called
chromatic and it makes it a 3d effect
which I love and I definitely think we
should do that for this photo save it to
my camera roll and then I open up visco
right away
normally I just have an edit that I
always use and I'll copy it from another
photo copy edit and then I just paste it
on that photo and I'll show you guys
kind of what that edit consists of so
it's s1 up to 3.4 and then I also do a
little bit of exposure
like 0.3 I crop the image so it fits
long ways on Instagram for this specific
photo I have the skin tone up to a point
to I add grain everyone asked what I do
grain on so it's a visco that I use and
I always go to shadows tint and I love
to do yellow so I have three point two
on yellow right now and then I just hit
save to camera roll and then I'm ready
to post on Instagram to other apps I
just want to show you guys that I think
you would really benefit from one it's
called eight millimeter and it looks
like this there you guys can see how
vintage it looks I absolutely am in love
with it and you could touch the top
right corner and it switches the effect
of the film which I love you could take
photos and videos on here if you guys
are ever wondering how I get these
really cute short little videos that I
post on my Instagram story sometime okay
and then the other app that I really am
obsessed with lately is called HUJI what
I love most about this app is the photos
kind of look like film or Polaroid for
example so if I just take one flash and
then it says it's processing and then I
go to my lab up here and this is what it
kind of looks like here's an example of
a photo that I just took with one of my
best friends at a bar thank you guys so
much for taking the time to watch this
video I hope you loved it and don't
forget to comment down below which look
was your favorite and if you guys try
