I'm doing another winter trying haul for
you guys just because you guys give me
the best absolute feedback about my
style and my clothes in the comments and
it means so much we still trying
response all the comments on this video
but if you're new to my channel welcome
thank you so much for subscribing I love
you so much if you want to follow me on
instagram is a Kaiser and my snapchat is
Cali and if you want a more everyday
look into my life but you'll mostly just
be seeing snapchats of my dogs um
without further ado I can't wait to show
you guys some really awesome pieces that
I picked out and then if you are a
beauty guru
I have makeup products that I picked up
at Sephora like foundations and
highlight and stuff will be at the end
of this video you're welcome but yeah I
can't wait to show you guys what I got
so here we go the first piece I'm
absolutely obsessed with that I want to
show you guys is from the designer
Danielle musio or we though I don't know
how to pronounce your last name but I'll
link her Instagram and website down
below holy crap she's so good at
designing clothes and her website isn't
overwhelming because she only has a
select few items on her website that
make sense so here is this amazing
2-piece jumpsuit that's made inside out
which I love is this caramel or camel
color and then here's what the bottoms
look like these are more of a jogger
type sweats but I have just been living
in this lately and I absolutely love it
I haven't worn it together in public but
I definitely separate them and then I
work together if I take a photo or
something so the next few pieces I have
to share with you guys are from this
amazing company called subdued they only
have one location in the US so if you
live in Santa Monica you're very lucky
they're really close to 3rd Street
Promenade on 4:16 Broadway in Santa
Monica I believe and I went to that
location before I came home for winter
break and today help me pick out some of
these clothes and I'm absolutely
obsessed there were the nicest people
there is Hallie and brand from Italy so
they have stores all over Europe and of
course an online store which I'll link
down below in the description box but
here is one of the first pieces that I
absolutely just adore it is this black
see-through
silvery sheen mesh top and it has a
really nice neckline that doesn't swoop
but
sits right on your collarbone which I
love I wore this on Christmas Day to a
family party and I layered an amazing
bra way under it with like a sick
leather jacket on top so you could
definitely wear a tank top underneath
this layer another long-sleeve
underneath this layer this underneath
t-shirts or wear a bra let with it you
could style this shirt so many different
ways and it's so flattering my favorite
thing I got from subdued is this simple
black bodysuit it has an amazing low-cut
V so it shows just the right amount of
cleavage down your chest and then it's a
cheeky material down here that's almost
that seamless look so you're not going
to see this when you wear jeans or a
skirt underneath it I got - size small
but it fits so perfect and I literally
layer this with anything looks great
when I felt my when I got for Christmas
video so many of you guys asked me it's
amazing fuzzy hooded sweater was from
its from subdued I'm in love with it I
haven't been taking this off actually
slept in it last night it is so soft
it's amazing white cream color I got
mine in the size medium I believe yes I
got - size medium it keeps you super
warm it's just so cut there's us not
enough good things you can say about
this it's so nice I'm obsessed with this
navy blue red and white vintage looking
sweater this is also from some dude I'll
leave a link for the website down below
but this looks amazing with denim or
with black jeans it just depends on how
you style it and it's super soft big
knit material definitely keeps me really
warm for being home in Chicago I also
got a really great pair of denim from
them this is size 24 these are the
boyfriend fit I'm loving the uncut thing
at the bottom if you guys can see that
and then these make my bum look so nice
and flatter than how it happens because
I don't have a butt sign I really like
the color of the centum and they're
really soft materials so they're really
good every day geez if you saw my with
your lookbook I paired them with fishnet
tights and a spotty suit of bomber and
they will
and then for the next sure it's this
amazing off-the-shoulder sweater I love
anything off the shoulder right now
because you could pop some highlighter
on your collarbones and it will show off
but this also has that super pretty
silver sheen to it built into the
sweater as you guys can see and this
looks really good with high waisted
pants nasty I'll also had a sale after
Christmas and I got this amazing
turtleneck see-through mesh star long
sleeve crop top
wow that was a sentence it's the motel
brand I got this in the size extra small
and it's still kind of like baggy on my
waist area which is surprising because
it's an extra small but you guys can see
the stars this looks really great
layered with high-waisted jeans and a
cute bra underneath it but yeah this was
only 15 bucks that was addressed and at
Urban Outfitters I also went to the boys
section I live for wearing boys clothes
my favorite thing and I love Stussy the
brand I want to get a boy's black stuffy
sweatshirt so bad but I picked up this
it's this amazing mesh jersey I got my
size small it says dusty on it and it is
that caramel camel color again and it
has just white black stripes all over it
I don't know I thought this was really
sporty and chic and then I open
Outfitters I was in their sales section
and I got this Calvin Klein Jeans
leather crop sports bra in an extra
small this looks so good later any mesh
designed long sleeve tops I own so much
mesh it's insane but I love the elastic
band they have right below the chest on
your bust area I don't even know if that
would be my best but yeah I really love
those got an extra small I walked into
noir shrooms a few days before New
Year's Eve and I was living for these
pants I had to get them mine are the
size 26 and they're definitely NYC brand
I also saw the longer goal if you can't
find them at Nordstrom's but they have
some bum pockets they are more of a
legging tight pant and they're serving
us some hippy vibes because they have
boot cut bottoms
I'm obsessed bell-bottom bell-bottom
bottoms I'm obsessed with these they're
so sick they look amazing with any tea
a leather jacket and they're super
comfortable I wanted to thrash your
t-shirt for so long so I picked one up
either on zuny's comm or on Hot Topic I
can't remember
I got a medium by which I got a large
just because it's 100% cotton but yes
I'm very excited to wear this t-shirt I
also got this Thrasher Magazine of
beanie on Amazon who's really
inexpensive I just love beanies I wear
them all the time here's what this one
looks like love it
I've been spending so much money on
dolls kill lately someone needs to stop
me they always have such good sales and
I'm obsessed with their clothes so I'll
leave a link down below description box
for everything I show you guys from
dolls kill but also I can get you guys
15% off anyone who shops on there when
you check out it gives you an option to
give your friends 50% off by sending
them a link in the email so I'm just
leaving my 15% off for you guys link
down below in description box but I'm
obsessed with this black shave London
mesh dress I want to try and ribs from
shell in some way I got mine an extra
small and this looks so flattering right
here if your leg just peeks through this
zipper and then it has this amazing
rubber tag that says shades London on it
I love the way that looks but yeah this
is definitely a new fave and then I got
two sweaters this one is so different
cool I dress a lot more grungy in the
wintertime I don't know if you guys have
noticed and I dress a little bit more
girly in the summertime but this has a
broken heart
near the ribs over here and the back is
just black and white stripes with bones
on the sleeves I love this this looks so
good with a leather jacket and some
amazing like crimped hair going on I
don't know I really love this I did get
my no size medium because I like
anything
we're sized and then this is the softest
material ever so so soft it has ripped
sweater rip swag Jill has ripped holes
all over it I got this in a size small I
believe it's v-neck has a hood it's just
really oversized cozy sweater and it has
a ribbed knit material on the sleeves
this is probably the weirdest thing I
got but you never know you're going to
need something super colorful and weird
like this so I got this mesh t-shirt
dress that I might end up even cutting
right underneath like the under boob
area I got my nice size small I don't
know what I'm doing with it yet but I
thought I just showed you guys anyway
because I really look I picked up these
amazing faux fur light pink black is
this suede yeah this is suede material
little sandal heels from Zara I'm
obsessed with them I was in in line at
the checkout with my $9 sale tank top I
was so excited to buy I'm not gonna
spend any more money and then I saw
these near the checkout counter
and I had to buy them so they're around
$60 so they're not outrageous for the
normal prices of Zara shoes but I do
absolutely love them and they look so
good I got these boots in the mail
yesterday I bought the wicked
Nordstrom's gift card I got my stocking
for Christmas I don't remember what this
shiny leather material is called I know
this isn't real leather but it's that
kind of shiny knockoff leather material
I'm obsessed with these they have this
velcro design at the top here and they
just lace up the whole way just like an
amazing combat boot with nice rubber at
the bottom they kind of look like Doc
Marten styles with this little tab going
on up here but yes I love them they're
the brand Shelley London I know people
say these runs small but they're
six-and-a-half fits me perfect if you
guys are looking for really inexpensive
sparkly diamond chokers other than
forever 21 this one is under $15 I'm
obsessed with this from the Betsy brand
moon shop chokers I'll have a link down
below description box and then these two
are from the brand choker
things which they do so well this one is
the Julia choker which is also really
inexpensive and then this one has really
pretty royal blue diamonds in the middle
will silver around the edges and these
chokers so good for a night out or
you're taking pics I love them to show
you guys some makeup I picked up
recently this is the Mac soft and gentle
mineralized skinfinish I am obsessed
with this this is the best highlighter I
have ever used in my life it gives it
more of a wet finish instead of a
powdery look if that makes sense
you guys can totally see it from here
but this is what it looks like and then
so many of you guys recommended
foundations for me so thank you so so
much
when I did my everyday makeup routine
you guys left me comments so I picked up
the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation
because you guys told me to and I got
the lightest shade and didn't work it
was way too dark so this is now my new
spray tan shade but holy crap is Kat Von
D foundation that you guys recommend it
for me is so good and don't worry I'm
still gonna try the hourglass stick they
just didn't have my shade when I went to
go pick it up but my shade is the light
four four and this is cool toned I am
obsessed with this it's full coverage
I'm wearing it today and it still keeps
my skin that kind of dewy even though
it's super super matte and then I have
also got this Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
which I actually had bought this
previously and I ran out and I got this
again but it's too dark for me right now
because I'm not getting any Sun while
I'm here in Chicago and but when I'm
back in LA I get more pigment to my skin
and I'm able to wear this again I got
the white shade 115 and is the are 230
shade this is my second time re buying
the invisible undercover perfecting
coconut face primer from Marc Jacobs I
love this stuff holy crap also the
packaging is just the most beautiful
I've ever seen in my life it has a pump
that looks like this really easy I do
one pump all over my face and it's more
of a moisturizing primer and then I also
picked up probably the most talked-about
product ever on YouTube is the Laura
Mercier translucent loose setting powder
I love it so much I don't set my hair
face or bake my face so I think this is
perfect for that and then I also got
this for Christmas but I forgot to
including what I got for Christmas is
the Bobbi Brown shimmer brick palette
and it has the gold bronze and wild rose
shades it so pretty they're so pigmented
I saw mani anyway have this and I was
like I need that because I love all the
makeup he has so much um so yeah I'll
just swatch this for you guys so pretty
on up you guys can see from here but
they do give off a really nice sheen I
have been using the middle one a little
bit for some eye shadow highlight thank
you guys so much to get time to watch
this video I hope you loved it have a
beautiful day
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
