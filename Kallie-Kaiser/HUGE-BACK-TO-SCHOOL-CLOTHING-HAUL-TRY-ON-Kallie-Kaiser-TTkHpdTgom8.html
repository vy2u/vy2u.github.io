you can unbutton it or keep it buttoned
whatever you're feeling or you can even
have a cute bra let peeking out but I
just love how basic and amazing this is

middle leave it alone wear it with some
high-waisted jeans you can literally
wear anything with high-waisted jeans I

other day and I got some bomb pieces I
loved Reformation so much because their
sizes fit me so good and I am
teat because I'm only 5 3 how amazing
are these jeans I got them in a size 24
they look like this they just have a
middle seam going all the way down the
leg so they totally have the illusion of
me looking taller than I am which I love
this piece is so amazing it is just a
red jumper and it kind of has a bustier
looking design right here which I love
it's super slimming on the body it makes
me look really tall because there it's a
jumper
it's a pantsuit which I love I also got
this at Reformation it is so gorgeous so
I don't know if you guys can see the
cut-offs right here but they're just
tied together with bows and then it's
just a spaghetti strap ribbed knit dress
it goes past the knees which is
absolutely incredible it really shows
your feet oh my gosh I can't dog it
really shows your figure which I love
and that's why this dress is so comfy it
just hugs you this is probably the
coolest thing that I'm putting in my
Hall it is from the brand as I am I'm
actually so obsessed with it and silver
hardware on the top is so amazing it is
I want to say it's that patent leather
design is that what kind of fabric this
is a bright yellow my favorite and then
it comes with a matching skirt I got a
size small on the skirt as well this
silver hardware is so dope so I'll have
a link down below for you guys you guys

it will be linked down below for you
guys but how gorgeous is this gonna look
at any festival even it's perfect for
back-to-school if you layer it with just
a leather jacket it has these amazing
ruffles that are just sewn in on the top
I love the structure of it and I love
owning clothes that no one else really
owns and it totally just speaks of your
style sorry that was
so random to say hey but that's what I
love about clothing it's so cool
the brand oh I got to share with you is
honestly so so so so dope so the first
thing that I got this is the brand
half-mad I'll have everything link down
below for you guys so how amazing is
this pink skirt it has ties on both
sides it's so structured it looks
amazing literally anything can pair it
with so I'm definitely bringing this to
New York Fashion Week
obsessed and then I got an amazing
oversized yellow t-shirt that just says
stay cool with a bunch of fruits right
here incredible I love it I got mine in
a size medium just looks like this and
then this is probably one of my
favorites I got a bikini from them so
this stretch is it's so amazing it's
just all black really amazing ribs
material and then the bottoms look like
this they are a little cheeky there are
more of a full coverage bikini but they
are the perfect amount of cheekiness for
my booty and it just looks like this I
love they also have it in a bunch of
other colors but I could set the white
and black one I got this top at
Nordstrom it is the brand a star how do
you say this astr brand size small it's
white I just love the way it's kind of
bougie looking I wore it for my 21st
birthday and they didn't card me a
brandy melville I picked up one of these
scarves that a lot of people have been
wearing lately I wear it as a do-rag
because I think it looks cool with your
hair flowing downs you can just wear it
like this
and tie it and yeah or you can tie it on
your bag where does a top at brandy
melville I also got this really nice
waffle long-sleeve hood in kind of
oversized t-shirt it was a really long
sentence I normally never buy stuff from
brandy melville but I just went in there
the other day once I moved back to
California I'm in my new apartment and I
absolutely love this so comfy I can't
wait to wear a at brandy melville I
picked up just this really cute pale
yellow tube top it's perfect to wear
with a jacket at brandy I also got this
yellow t-shirt I obviously have not worn
it yet and I'm really into basic
t-shirts tying them right underneath
your boob I think that looks so good
with high-waisted jeans I got a pair of
yellow Levi's I got these um super super
sale at Anthropologie they were
literally 30 percent off of whatever 19
dollars is so nineteen dollars 30% off
get your calculators out online
Reformation had a huge sale so I got a
few stuff on there and I got this
amazing striped white and yellow really
stretchy just basic top you can wear it
across the shoulders or on top of your
shoulders whatever your heart desires on
Reformation online I picked out this
really cute dress it was out of stock
for a while and then right when they
send me an email that it was back in
stock I had to buy it I loved it it just
looks like this it's all black just
perfect to throw on you can even wear a
leather jacket with it now you can't
wear anything to school totally just add
a jacket to it I don't know your guys
dress codes or that kind of stuff online
at Reformation as well I am really into
kind of chic looking tops that are quite
a more vintage or designer looking I
like when you wear them all buttoned up
with just denim or high-waisted shorts
so I got this really pretty sheer
long-sleeve ruffled top in black I got
into size extra small it's from
Reformation as well online at the
Reformation sale I also got this cropped
white long-sleeved turtleneck they
is probably my favorite thing that I
purchased recently it is incredibly soft
and it looks good to layer with anything
can even wear a bra layin or anything
because it's kind of see-through I got
this amazing just white flowy girly
blouse the sleeves are so delicate and
beautiful I absolutely love this when I
was in Italy I really didn't do that
much shopping but I did get myself just
a really cute purse to put some
lipsticks in I know that's really
pointless to say but I'm saying it
anyways and I love it just has silver
Hardware all up and down and a phone is
not fitting here oh my gosh I've been
looking for this lipgloss on Free People
I also got these really cool red glasses
they make everything in red so cool I'll
show you guys I'll put the lenses up on
the camera oh it doesn't really work on
Free People as well I got this lovely
mesh turtleneck but it's kind of a bro
tank material so it's great to just
layer underneath leather jackets that
hold gist I got my undersized extra
small accurate people I picked up a
really cute yellow velvet set and I
totally think you could wear this yellow
top even though it's the velvet all year
round I've wore a little bit this past
end of the summer season and I'm totally
gonna wear this in the fall it's perfect
for back-to-school throw it on with some
high-waisted jeans so I got the top and
a size small and the bottoms in an extra
small they're just so cute the only
thing I wish is I wish this with a
different color
I then splurged a little more on a
product of an item normally whatever but
I purchased a skinny Gucci bail I got
the gold hardware and I absolutely love
it and I just was say thank you guys for
watching all my videos because I did
purchase this with my own money
it literally would not be possible
without you guys so thank you so much I
then picked up some oversized t-shirts

comfy clothes from I always shop in a
guy section though and then I got this
an active it's a skate stop

this I then picked up this dusty shirt I
wear this one as a dress with really
cool like black patent leather boots it

great layering a cool bralette
underneath it okay so one my favorite
store is Ella I've had them in my holes
before they were having their sale right
now so of course I had to pick up some
of their lovely pieces I'm really into a
cropped oversized t-shirt so I picked up
a few this one is amazing because as

simple it's the MN Sam Brants you can
definitely shop this online it's
probably out of stock because it's so
awesome and then I just got a cute
little white knit cropped tee and I wear
it so often it's probably one of my
favorite shirts now I love this one

stripes lately too and this is
definitely more of a fall color so it's
perfect for the season coming up

t-shirt dress it's all black oversized
