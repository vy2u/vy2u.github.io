cyber monday Black Friday stuff and
everything will be linked down below
unless I cannot find out an internet for
you so I'm very sorry but without
further ado I'd love to you in this
video also if you're not calling you my
Instagram is Acula Kaiser and I'm
thinking about posting it some Q&amp;amp;A
questions on there soon so keep an eye
out for that but I hope you guys have
been having a lovely day and I can't
wait to eat in this video so for you I
went to the NASA girl store on Third
Street Promenade and I got this amazing
bodysuit with lightning bolts right on
your chest this has the perfect amount
of sb it's so flattering and then it's a
cheeky or thong stunt and this is
definitely not that it's definitely
cheeky bodysuit so it's more comfortable
event abuse full coverage and it just
looks like this and then I love to wear
it with this skirt that I also got at
Nesta gale it's the motel brand and I
got in a size extra small I can't wait
to wear this for the holiday season and
you can also change up the is it working
please tell me you can change up okay I
honestly have to say Nasty Gal used to
be my absolute favorite website but
lately dolls kill has been my absolute
favorite website to shop on so the first
thing I got is this shirt is from the
ragged priest it's amazing because it's
velvet and it says revolting on it I'm
just in love with this t-shirt I
normally go
we're teachers like this anymore but I
only love this one and the next thing I
got is this amazing black sweater it
goes off the shoulders like this and
it's so flattering so if you want to
wear some funky pant funky bell-bottom
pants looks so good with this um here's
what the sweater looks like as you guys
can see it has a nice design on the
bottom and the top that correlates as
you can see and you can wear it even not
off the shoulders if you don't want and
the neckline is still really flattering
I got this really cool black crop top
the neckline is super droopy and low the
collar is really interesting I am in
love with it I'm really into grungy dark
clothes lately but it has a lock with a
key on it and then it kind of has like
this tuxedo stripe all around the neck
it looks so good with high-waisted jeans
and I think I bought this for like 20
bucks literally dolt kills the best
sales ever I have been wearing this
sweatshirt every single day it's my new
fave it's from dolls kill as well just
says babe and it's a camo hoodie it just
looks so good and so comfortable I don't
know the exact brand it's from it says
petals and peacocks and I got in a size
medium how many of you guys have heard
of shade London but they sell it on
dolls Cal and I got this super super
super on sale I think it's so fun and
funky it's that mango yellow or like a
mustard yellow color here's the matching
skirt I got this set and a size extra
small but I love how the shade London is
like a tag and they use it as the zipper
I can't wait to find how to wear this or
I can't wait to photograph in it these
are from doll hill as well they're also
the brand who ride priest I love the
brand the ragged priest you guys are
going to die are you ready fire these
needs are amazing and then the cut out
is super nice as well and they are
skinny at the bottom but they aren't
super loose as well I got mine in size
24 oh my god they're amazing you could
totally DIY this if you have sew-on
patches with flames or if you know how
to embroider this yourself good luck
and then this jacket slays me this
jacket look at it it's from
the brand Cali girl boutique I'll link
their Instagram down below oh my gosh
they sell the cutest stuff so it just
has this rhinestone lips on it and the
black denim jacket is kind of frayed up
I'm obsessed
and it's kind of cropped look so it
looks really good with high-waisted
jeans and it's kind of a thicker I don't
know if it's really thin but it
definitely will keep you warm the day
after Black Friday I walked into Free
People
oh my gosh this dress is everything it's
that black crushed velvet it's so
flattering I got this in a size extra
small it's not too sure if it's not too
long and the lace come on come on it's
beautiful and also just fits so nicely
so anyone you need this in your life
they also salt and light pink and white
go get it that same day and free people
I got this oversized sweatshirt it was
an extra 25 percent off in the sales
section I got mine in a size small the
sleeves are going to cut like
three-quarter lengths and they have
holes all over I love the metal eyelets
that they have oh where is it oh here it
is it's only on one side weird the metal
eyelets they have on the hoodie and then
it just looks like this it's similar to
a dress on me I've worn this with
oversize I've worn this with oversize
I've worn with his tights as an
oversized look and I look so cute and
then when I was three people on Black
Friday as well my boyfriend got me this
amazing set of earrings there's just a
bunch of studs in the middle and then
there's a little bit more Nessa once
around the edge I love this oh my gosh
as you guys can see I have them all
layered in my ear right now so this is
what they look like I think it was two
days before Black Friday I got this
leather skirt at the LF outlay was 24
bucks so cheap and I decided to wear it
actually on Thanksgiving I love it it's
just a leather miniskirt and it's not
too short so that's really good to wear
for the holidays but yeah it just looks
like this alright this bodysuit is from
the house of CB London I bought
because my life is ava had this on her
Instagram and she looked so good in it
so I had to get it it's this see-through
mesh tan design tan design tan color and
it's turtleneck it's super stretchy and
spandex that you could wear a really
nice Follet I know you guys can see that
material but it's super lightweight and
it feels like you just have a second
layer of skin on so this will look
amazing I need a leather jacket or
anything you want to layer it with but I
just think it's so flattering and then
actually on for lovin Lemmons websites I
got two pairs of skivvies so the first
skivvy I got it is an extra 30% off I'm
for loving lemons I got this amazing
beautiful bralette it's just this purple
blue color I would call a purple maybe I
don't know with this lace peeking out
and then this is also that see-through
mesh material right here the back band
is super elastic and stretchy and it
goes like this
but as you guys can see it's just super
simple and elegant this will look great
underneath tank tops or sweaters and
then oh my gosh I'm about to show you
the most beautiful piece of clothing
you've ever seen in your entire life so
I have wanted this body suit on for
loving lemons for probably the longest
time ever and I finally purchased it
away it's inside-out
honestly it is the most beautiful piece
of clothing I own look at these sleeves
it's just completely black lace and then
obviously it's a bodysuit down here
here's what the back looks like it's
completely open and it ties in about the
top and then on your lower back down
here oh it's so flattering I'm
absolutely in love with this I'm so
excited I will probably end up wearing
this as one of my Coachella outfits
I went over love and lemon sample sale
and everything is around 80% off so I
got some bomb stuff I got this amazing
black crop crochet swim cover-up top I
absolutely love it if you look close
enough you can see the sweetheart design
and then there's two leaves in front of
the boobs I love this and the sleeves
are just as pretty I also got this
hooded sweater sweatshirt it has
crisscross all of it on the chest and
then in the midsection and then some
amazing fringe on the bottom this looks
so good with black
or leather leggings I can't wait to wear
this in the winter especially because
I'm going home to Chicago for Christmas
time
this is kind of reminding me of the
Adams family daughter I think it's kind
of old school school-girl design I don't
know how to explain it but it's really
tight on my midsection and then it just
has this see-through mesh material it's
kind of like a light tan color and then
the sleeves just look like this this
looks so flattering on I'll probably
wear it for the holidays and then I got
this really pretty white lace light baby
blue Victorian style top the sleeves are
super girly I never really buy this many
girly stuff usually I just wear black
and stick to that color but you can tie
it both ways so here's the back you tie
this around that and then this around
this and then this is the front but you
can also tie this as the front and it
looks just as good I have wanted one of
these dresses for the longest time ever
and they're way too expensive so so
happy to get this on sale I got the
white one and then this is also that
see-through mesh material but it's kind
of like a light tan color it has that
sweetheart design and then it has
embroidery of white flowers on it this
is a maxi so it goes all the way down
and it oh my gosh and it's just so
stunning I hope I can wear this to a
wedding or something I know I'm unable
to even wear this to a wedding even
though it's white but so flattering and
the back completely drops down like that
you guys will see it once I try it on
and then the last thing I got from the
sample sale is this super comfortable
cozy cropped sweater it's a cream white
color and it has these amazing braids of
knit wool all over it and it looks so
good alright now for the score of the
century I went to Nasty Gal sale section
so nasty gal nasty gal slays me every
year with cyber monday and black
Friday so you know I've shopped on both
days on there so we have this huge box
in front of us and the first thing I'm
going to show you is this oh I can't
wait to wear this so it is just this
amazing tank top fish net dress with
these fun fringe tassels hanging down
low I got this in a size small just
because the extra small is kind of tight
around my bust area and it wasn't very
comfortable I kind of want to wear this
to Coachella but I don't know yet I got
another fishnet dress because I hate
fishnet I'm actually so in love with
fishnet lately this is a size small as
well it's another fishnet dress this
one's long sleeve and it has a built in
black bodysuit
as you guys can see and it's kind of
like more of a mini look but and right
below your knees or depending on how
tall you are I'm really sure I'm only
5'4 so but yeah so cute
this is falling like Eric and I got just
because it's so funky and weird and fun
and I love anything that's different I
got a set of size extra small it is this
turtleneck mesh dress long sleeve what
is this design and as roses backs chains
on it and it says loan what does it say
on it oh my gosh they're spires on it
too I didn't know that I still love it
and then I got this amazing sweater
that's super fuzzy and soft
it's a turtleneck so you can roll it up
however you want it's definitely a crop
tank top looks so good with black jeans
if you guys have been watching my halls
for a while now you know I'm obsessed
with snakeskin so then the last thing I
got on Nasty Gal were these amazing
snakeskin shoes I love these gold
eyelets that help lace up the entire
look and then there's just a simple
strap right across the toes I normally
am really into pointed toe heels or
pumps but instead I decided to go with
more like that square look alright then
for anyone who hasn't heard of fawn star
you need to go to the website right now
they
really have the most beautiful jewelry
ever so I'll show you guys the pieces I
got from them first piece I got from
them is this gorgeous silver and gold
cross choker I in love it glistens and
sparkles so nice when you have a flash
held up to air or anything like that so
it just looks like this so effortlessly
beautiful and then I also have this
amazing star necklace it's all gold with
silver in it I'll show you guys what
this looks like as well and here's what
the gold star necklace looks like oh I
just love it it looks so pretty I love
when gold and silver is mixed together I
think it photographs so much better but
yet you guys have to check out fond star
they have the most beautiful pieces I
also have been wearing this camo
sweatshirt like crazy I decided to get
in size medium because I wanted it more
oversized on me it's from forever 21 and
is literally 14 bucks
and it just looks like this the coloring
is amazing and I've just been wearing a
lot of camel lately camel lately I don't
know why and then this is from forever
21 to this is one of my new fave it is
so comfortable and soft it just has this
amazing soft fuzzy material on the
inside and then the outside looks more
like wool but it's not as rough as wool
and I got - I small and it's just this
amazing cardigan sweater jacket what I
feel to call it and then I went to
wasteland and I got this camo oversized
jacket in the men's section I'm in love
with it it's super thin so it doesn't
keep me really warm but I love to layer
with it and it just looks like this it
looks really nice with jeans here's what
the back looks like and it just has
simple pocket designs like this I don't
know I just been really diggin it lately
and I love it okay these shoes are the
score of the century I walked into
forever 21 when I was back in
Kongo I think it was like the day before
Black Friday or something
I think gosh I did because they would
totally be gone if it was Black Friday
they're just these amazing high over the
knee-high boots it's definitely that
Stuart Weitzman look if you guys know
that shoe brand um but they're just for
like I don't know nine hundred fifty
dollars cheaper so I will definitely
link these down below I've been wearing
them all the time with oversized
sweatshirts and fishnet tights and they
basically just look so good with jeans
or leather pants for some more shoes
public desire sent me these I'm
absolutely in love they're just these
pointed toe snakeskin little ankle
booties they tie in the back not tie but
they buckle and they show your heel off
and then I got these super simple black
boots from public desire I love how the
fabric up here super floppy these are
definitely more of a matte look I don't
know what material this is exactly but
as you guys can see they're really easy
to walk in because it feels so chunky
