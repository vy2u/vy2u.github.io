have another trying hole to share with
you guys I know I've been uploading a
bunch of hauls and collections lately
but you guys have no idea even all my
Instagram you guys are commenting I want
to see another whole video post another
haul video please please please so of
course I'm going to give you what you
guys wanted for the past two weeks
that's all I've seen in my comments on
my videos as well do another haul do
another haul so here we go in my past
Tryon holes I never have ever started a
video with the shoes or accessories so
today we're spicing it up a bit and that
is what we're doing so I have these
amazing Jeffrey Campbell booties they
are this awesome red color I don't own
any red shoes so this is totally bizarre
to have a pair of red shoes but I'm so
psyched about it the studs and then the
beatings that are on the suede band
right here are amazing the cutouts give
me life and the chunk is the perfect
heel height for going out or for a
casual day I love these nasty on sale
section is the best sale section on the
planet Earth I live by it I try and save
a lot of money on there but yeah these
were on sale there's so many Jeffrey
Campbell's on sale on Nasty Gal I will
leave a link for everything down below
in the description box that I show on
show on that I try on in this video for
you guys for the next pair of shoes I
have to share with you guys these are
Jeffrey Campbell's as well I would
consider these a light tan color I don't
know I could be wrong you guys let me
know down below in the comments the
cutouts are so nice on these I also love
on the oponent toe pointed toe they are
so comfortable
I've also worn these about four or five
times now and you can't even tell I mean
there's a little dirt right there but
honestly that's nothing and then I
really like a silver detailing and how
they're cut out at the ankles I think
that's so cool and then I picked up a
pair of Converse because I actually
ruined my converse that I have happened
past 4 years and I felt it was time to
invest in a new pair I got these off of
in Nordstrom's
they're not all white they always have
an off-white with the white and black
outline
I really like these I got these because
I'm needed Congress to wear on four days
to Lollapalooza and I thought these are
going to look so good with outfits the
next pair is from Lulu's calm oh my gosh
these are so cute they're the perfect
summer sandal to be honest they lace up
the leg you guys can't tell them tell
how they look right now just because I
don't have a leg to lace up for you guys
right here but you will see it when I
show you in the b-roll they do run
true-to-size and I got a size
six-and-a-half I also picked up a new
pair of ray-bans I got these on Amazon
for $45 less than if I were to buy these
on Raven comm they are just near outed
silver lenses I think these are so
flattering on any face honestly if you
have a skinny or very square face I kind
of have a square face I don't know if
you guys can tell but I think these are
so sick and they look even cooler
outside right now I don't know if you
guys can see how weird they are but I
also have a few other pairs of
sunglasses to share with you guys I
don't know how I forgot to talk about
them but this pair is super cool because
the reflectors on the mirror lenses are
blue and green these are from Lulu's and
they're just that traditional round
shape the next ones are these white and
gold ones I really like these because
they're a little funkier than usual so
if you're trying to dress up your
sunglasses I definitely go for this one
the next pair is probably my favorite
new pair of sunglasses it is from
princess Polly and I love how these look
so retro and cool with you gold and then
I believe these are black your luscious
but I change I'm nasty doll I also
picked up a backpack I thought this was
such a cool design I like how it's
almost modern but funky there is some
studs along the zipper over here I
didn't take the packaging out of it so
that's why it still looks so sturdy in
there but Wow I can't wait to use this I
bought this because I knew
to California August 17th I am only
going to be living five blocks from the
beach so I can't wait I really thought
this was a good bag if I wanted to go to
beach or even if I just didn't want to
carry a purse around that day I really
dig it and there's some cool studs right
here did I already say that anyways this
is from the brands like dreams and I
thought the star design just right she
was so perfect for everything this
season I think this is so in I'm nasty
Allah also picked up this really pretty
gold star necklace or choker it's
adjustable so you can make it a tight
choker or loose necklace depending on
your style and what is more comfortable
for you art and Rose is wearing this on
her snapchat within this past month and
I was like well I need that necklace
where is that so I typed it into Google
and then I found it on a CL thank the
Lord I was so excited so I really like
wigs books from Nasty Gal I also got
this amazing skirt the entire thing is
covered in studs obvious you guys can
see there is different sized studs so
the back looks like this and the front
looks like this it differs down the
front I got this in a size extra extra
small
I feel nasty elsker to run big so that's
why I do always get extra small this is
so flattering I thought this looked
amazing which this top that I got from
misguided I believe about this in a size
two I got this in size - yes and it has
that choker band in black around the
neck and then the top is just a bandeau
style I thought this was a cute outfit
I'm so cute I shouldn't see if I hold
this up next each other but I thought
this was really flattering together a
lot of Mama's used to have this shirt in
their collection but I found this on
Poshmark someone was selling us on
Poshmark
I want to say it's their Luna top but
it's so beautiful it is all see-through
except for this yellow embroidery on and
then it has a skin color fabric someone
that you can't see anything and then the
back is completely bare when your skin
is in there it's so cute I'm actually
going to be wearing a Salalah please in
one of the days and this is in a size
extra small I don't know how many of you
guys have ever shopped on Ratan Bella
but this was my first time I got this
super colorful dress that I'm going to
be wearing to Lollapalooza as well the
bottom is so cool because I want to say
these are rainbow colored flowers this
entire dress is crochet and I got the
synthesize extra small it's a holter
design if you guys ever strop on Retton
boa oh my gosh you totally should I have
wanted to buy stuff on rainbow for so
long they are a bit pricey I finally
made the purchase and the shipping was
super fast as well I got this super
flowy white cheese cloth type top that
I'm going to be wearing to Lollapalooza
as well this leaves are beautiful I have
a top like this in red and I wanted to
find it in white but not spend a lot of
money mine is in the size 8 and it just
ties in multiple different ways
obviously you guys will see when I try
it on but I love how flattering this is
and I think it's so cute
since I've been trying to find tops like
that i also bought one office out of 21
this one sells the tech I'm excited more
knit yet and I like this one because you
can also tie this multiple except this
is a more of an off-white or peachy pink
color the sleeves are a little great for
me but I still can totally do with it
and I'm definitely gonna be wearing this
in the summer and then I have some
awesome pieces to share with you guys
from princess Polly oh my gosh princess
Polly column I love you guys so much you
guys just get my style so I was so
excited to choose some items to share
with you guys from them so thank you for
gifting you with these and I can't wait
to share them with you so if you haven't
heard princess Polly calm before they
are an amazing cool online Australian
show TKE and they have these sickest
stuff so the first item I'm going to
share with you guys is this awesome
Western belt it has a up bowls head
embroider
right on the front with some stars it's
all leather also this is adjustable to a
high waisted
length so you could definitely wear this
with I waisted shorts like these look so
good with this belt just saying the next
item is this super cool white denim
skirt it's just cute because it's a
miniskirt so it's tight I got this in
the size six it's all white with brown
so here's what the back looks like I
picked up this top to wear with this
here and they look so good together
this is just a ribbed tee shirt crop top
whatever you want to call it I love the
colors on this I think the kind of old
school I got this in a size extra small
and it fits so good I am in love with
this romper it's super flowy and
beautiful these colors have been in this
entire summer and I hope that they stay
a little bit towards September in
October just because I love the color so
much it's that royal blue with white
design so this is just a beautiful deep
V it hooks in the back like this and
then this comes with a beautiful looking
scarf but actually tight on your waist
and you can adjust how tight you want
the romper or not other one side that
can even wear this is a cool headband I
think that will look awesome or even
make it a choker why not you can use so
many different things when a romper is
attached with a piece like this which I
love hey I am obsessed with this t-shirt
it says Bahama Mama and is more of a pro
tank and I'm t-shirt I got this in a
size small medium and it is so cute with
denim jean shorts I've been wearing this
all the time I actually just washed it
so it's nice and clean again and I'll
probably wear it three days in a row I
got this super cute romper it is all
white with little flowers and broidered
all over it the bottom and the sleeves
and down the DD chest area
pretty crochet or lace design and then
just weeds and ties in the middle this
is elastic around the back so you have
no problem stretching this when you step
into it and try it on I bought this in a
size six and it fits perfect the next
item is another skirt this is so cool
because it has frillies of denim on the
end and this is also a denim finished
shirt the top has the same frillies that
are on the bottom they're just less
extreme the back has a zipper and I got
this in a size 6 as well no extra small
which is a six and this actually looks
really cute with this Bahama Mama tank I
also got this bandana that I'm going to
be wearing Tamala Puzo like this I love
wearing the Indiana's like this
otherwise I finish folding them up and I
just wear them around my neck like this
and I taught them but I don't look like
this we're gonna do it but yeah I think
it looks super cute and it's kind of a
where's the word pilots design motor
pilots sign what are the ladies that
help out on the plane flight attendant
flight attendant design and I totally
did get it and then I have some items to
share with you guys from Lulu's calm I
just want to say thank you so much from
Lulu's calm they actually sent me these
clothes and I'm not to share with you
guys
it is so crazy because I used to show up
on loose calm all the time used to buy
my homecoming shoes there I even bought
my turnabout dress there one year so so
fun that they wanted to collaborate with
me on a haul video and just pick out
outfits to share with you guys so that
is exactly what I'm going to do so the
first piece that I got from Lou Thesz
comm is this amazing Oral Roberts show
and horrible I normally don't own
something this girly but I really needed
something this really because I can't
just wear black to my life so this is a
halter top design the sleeves are super
flowy and then it's tight around the
stomach and flowy around the shorts I
really dig this and I got this in a size
extra small I still love buying basics
so I have this super cute basic black
top you can
to wear this backwards or former's
person you even work backwards because
the front looks like this so it kind of
has that high neck and in the back is
just a low-cut deep V and I don't know
if you have any cool tank tops dealing
with it but I personally like to wear it
this is the front and I wear a cool tank
top or bra that under it and then the
back is just that simple high neck I
think that is cooler to wear I have
wanted a denim skirt for the longest
time ever I got this in a size small and
boy does this look good it also makes
you look tanner
even though I am quite pale the denim
designers makes real Tanner I don't know
why yes it has just simple design with a
clasp the button the button go but it
looks like this and then there's just
some awesome lilies along the bottom I
also picked up this silver chained felt
I love the beads all along the bottom I
really want to incorporate this into why
my lollapalooza looks I just have to see
how it looks with denim shorts but I'm
really excited to wear this I have one
in a bodysuit like this for the longest
time ever so around the neck it's just a
black choker there's a zipper down the
back this is a bodysuit I don't know if
I already said that the chest area is a
deep v-neck I actually don't have to
wear a bra with this the material is
supportive enough that I don't have to
for my bra size and I totally dig it how
do you feel me yeah I interrupt you
right the bell on it no I can redo why
do you have a question no I just wanted
to feel weight in here I know I can't
turn the light on I have to let the
natural light shine through okay you're
naturally like okay we're cooking rib he
wanted yes please say beat on I have
been obsessed with this teacher that
I've been wearing for the past four days
is that weird
I swear I'm pleased but yeah this says
Lewis just gets me it says on vacations
we wear bikinis I'm obsessed with
bikinis also this t-shirt cotton
material
is Type R it is so soft I think it over
I got this in the size extra small/small
there is this adorable jumper it's all
black the material is super thin I want
to say it's almost similar to a cotton
or linen material I could check for you
guys Oh
rayon it's rayon that's why I got this
in a size small and then just Criss
crosses in the back I thought this would
look great with a t-shirt or even a tank
top I think or you gonna brawl at
whatever you're feeling also you can
wear this as a bathing suit cover-up
I'm totally gonna wear it as bathing
suit cover-up also got these super cool
destroyed denim shorts I almost like
that these are a little baggy on me
because I like the boyfriend style of
shorts I got these in a size small and
then the back looks like this I have two
amazing long jumpsuits to share with you
guys so I'll start with the red one
first just because it's so bold and
beautiful so it Criss crosses in the
back and in the front area is it too low
than v-neck it's still very flattering
and then it's an entire jumpsuit like
this should I keep going I do have to
get the bottom hemmed a little just
because I am five three so everything
that is a jumper or jumpsuit that's long
or even maxi dresses I always have to
get them time so that's totally fine
this one fits me really well I actually
don't have to get the bottom pants on
this one this is an extra small as well
so the top is like this but fat Criss
crosses and then it's just that
beautiful long jumpsuit this makes me
look taller than I really am also I just
