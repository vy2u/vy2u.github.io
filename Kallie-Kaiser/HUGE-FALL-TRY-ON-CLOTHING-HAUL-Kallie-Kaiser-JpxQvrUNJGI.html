new favorite shirts that I recently
purchased it's a super stretchy really
lightweight soft ribs material it is
from dolls kill and it's just read off
the shoulders it's just effortlessly
chic I wore this to a really cold movie
premiere for Demi Lovato and I was able
to get red carpet pictures in this shirt
and I loved it it looks so good on so
flattering so I'm really into these
lieutenant style hats
yellow one on Urban Outfitters I'm sure
you can get it on Brixton's website -
because it's the brand Brixton but it
looks like this and it's so cute it just
I got mine in a size extra small this
size small ones are just like way too
big for my head I hate it and then this
amazing one is from dolls kill and I've
actually worn this so many times it's so
flattering it looks good with every
outfit and I love mixing textures so it
just basically has my name written all
over it this is a set as well it is a
reversible bomber and matching skirt

this how cool is this skirt way I'm
trying to flip out you guys can see this
amazing silver hardware going on I love
this it's like a quilted bomber and then
inside its orange and it's reversible
and then here's what the cropped bomber
top looks like these are amazing oh
there's a fuzzy so these are from dolls
kill I got mine in size extra small it
is their poster girl brand they are just
kind of like the velour sweats
they're velvet they're amazing and they
have a silk ribbon going all the way
down the leg which totally makes me look
longer because I am 5 3 I love vintage
t-shirts and since I'm 21 now I have one
mrs. Miller Lite on it I just got this
at LF it's the first of a kind brand it
looks like this the back things like
that and it looks amazing with like a
leather pants that I showed you guys
earlier love it come on how amazing is
this it's faux fur I got it on dolls
kill as well but it is the jacket brand
Jackie Jack I don't know how to say it
but I got - size extra small this is the
brand and it is just an oversized faux
fur yellow jacket how long I found these
on Frankie collective if that's how you
say it
and how could you not want these they're
so cool I got - size extra small they
happen to have them in stock and they're
comfy they're cool this is probably my
favorite thing that I've purchased in
the past forever I love this underwear

looks like I accidentally just needed a
place to put a safety pin do you ever do
that where you're just like safety pin
something never mind okay this is a size
small I love it
elastic around the bust and then here's
what the matching underwear looks like
or yellow of course my favorite these
are amazing because they're yellow and
then they have athletic stripes just all
the way down their sweatpants but
they're bootcut sweatpants and I haven't
worn highways and boot cuts like in
sweatpants in so long so I'm really
happy I invested in these there from
dolls kill these high-waisted sweatpants
are from the brand I am jeah
they just look like this they have the
athletic slip stripes all the way down
they're kind of like tied of bangle and
I got my name's size extra small buds
from dolls killed it's just red it is
baby that looks so good but I don't know
how I'm styling it yeah I got mine in
size small and if you can hear you can
see the hardware that's just hanging on
the bottom I love when like silver
accents are added to shirts I think it
adds so much personality okay this is
cute it's just a boob tube cheetah oh oh
my gosh I just scratched my leg anyways
I love this
I got it from LF this top is from dolls
kill as well it is these stretches look
at that it is so stretchy it's ribbed
it's the sweater material and the
sleeves kind of have a bell bottom look
to them but they're not too big of an
arm sleeve if you know what I mean and
it has this amazing cleavage slit but
it's not inappropriate if you know what
I mean I have this shirt in the bag
because I think I want to return it I
want to get an extra saw lat order size
small and I think it's just way too big
on me but it's from for love and lemon
it's their new knits collection oh my
gosh how beautiful is this top so
obviously it's faux fur just like sewn
in and it's just a little too big like
it hangs off but it's so beautiful I
really want to order it in a size
smaller or maybe just get one of their
other styles but it is so flowering and
I don't think anyone else really owns
stuff like this so that's why I love
getting like funky pieces like this okay
this is like a must have must have must
have it's like they made a blanket into
a jacket this is from Urban Outfitters
it's reversible so you can use this
color or this color doesn't matter I

this and it's so cozy I'll put it on for
you guys okay

every day to class and I can't wait okay
this jacket speaks to me on a whole
different level it is just this huge
oversized puffer from Urban Outfitters

amazing amazing jacket selection this
year I swear so it's perfect for fall
and winter

another amazing puffer jacket it is from
Urban Outfitters as well and I love this
because it's kind of like corduroy

for another jacket that I have I swear
we just have never-ending jackets going
on
this one's from LF look at how cool this
is it's a skull and the wings of it kind
of look like they're on flames it's like
a flying head skull which is really cool
and then of course it's just so
distressed ripped everywhere and I don't
want any black denim jackets so I'm
really excited and this would look so
good with leather pants as well so I
don't really care about purses anymore I
just love mini backpacks so dolls kills
sent me these and I love them they're so
amazing so obviously it's faux fur but
it's just this camo oh my gosh I have a
matching weekender bag that goes with
this one it's so amazing I'll grab it in
a second and then here's what the
checkered one looks like with these
silver hardware chains and then it's a
cincher so it cinches in and then it
flaps and then it's my
and then this is the matching weekender
bag and it looks like this I'll have
this link down below too but it's from
doles kill I picked up another pair of
Raymond's Ray Manzarek Chua Lee just my
favorite pair of sunglasses and I got
the octagonal ones they're so cool I

cool I don't know what else to say about
them but I wear them literally every
single day I got this dress from the
brand it's all wild which is my life is
Avis brand I love watching her video
she's so awesome so of course I wanted
to support and buy this dress from her
brand that she released anyways it's so
soft it's almost like a really super
lightweight fleece material the sleeves
go out kind of like a bell bottom shape
and it's a high neck I mean you guys you
could say this is a turtleneck for sure
and it's so comfortable I got my nice
size extra small it is a little tight
there's not a lot of stretch to it I got
this amazing just red patent leather
one-piece or body suit I forgot you the
word body seems so long so you lace it
up in the back this is from dolls kill
as well it's the ragged priest I love
love level of the ragged priest so this
is the Brant I already said the brand
this is tears on it and it's a really
cool color blocking compa combo as you
guys can see and I actually don't own
anything with orange on it this is my
first thing that I own I got this
amazing Stasi sweatshirt this is
probably the first one of the first
clothing items that I own from the woman
Stasi collection because I always buy
men's Tussey if that's how you say it
you guys are all gonna correct me in the
comments I already know but it's amazing
it's kind of like a heather gray color
since I love saucy so much I also got
this amazing weight breaker or I don't
know if this would be considered a rain
rain material it's like that dry pit
material that looks like this
just as stuffy the perfect it's a
perfect fall color it makes so much
sound I don't even know if you can hear
me over this but I got it in size small
it's great for layering it will look
good with like t-shirts layered tank
tops layered I love it
I've been really into cropped or cutting
my t-shirts and then wearing them with
high-waisted sweats cuz I literally wear
high-waisted sweatpants every single day
you guys don't understand so I got this
amazing stuff C shirt from active ride
shop this will be linked down below to
it's probably fun stuff C but I actually
cut it so that I can wear it with just
like about two privates and sweats and
it has dice in between as the two essays
for Stussy which is really cool I got
this shirt at the LF sale it's just the
Emma and Sam brand but I left makes and
it has flames on it I'm not over flames
yet I feel like you can do it delicately
delicately
no idea what I'm saying this amazing
jacket is from Urban Outfitters I got it
in the black fleece they also have it in
a tan or like a beige color I believe
but it looks like this so comfy perfect
for winter Wow perfect for if you're
having a bonfire I can't wait to go home
for the holidays if you can't tell
already but yeah it just looks like this
I got this champion matching sweat suit
from Urban Outfitters I love it it's
kind of like a cream color off-white I
got this in a size small so so comfy
it's like the Urban Outfitters reverse
weave inside-out hoodie or something
and then here's what the matching
sweatpants that are cut off look like
they're like sweat shorts kind of like
basketball shorts and I love them these
are size extra small be done sent me
this absolutely adorable sweat suit I
love it it is all pink this material is
so comfy I don't know if this is cotton
or what I'm sure we can check on the tag
but anyways I got the size extra small
for the sweatshirt and the sweatpants
and it has just embroidered redone on it
and if you guys want to get 20% off just
for your benefit only if you're
interested in shopping with redone just
use the code Cali 20 this two-piece set
is from the brand 12th tribe I love it
I'll have it linked down below for you
guys it's so comfortable the top looks
like this I haven't worn the top yet
obviously because it still has the tags
on it but I love it I got mine in a size
extra small and I love this elastic band
that's just like structured right under
the boob and then here's the pant
they're high-waisted they have pockets
and then they have that same elastic at
the bottom near the jogger part of the
leg you know what I'm talking about and
then these are size extra small as well
this talk is from the brand 12th tribe
as well and I love that they have two
cherries just on the shirt right there I
love that I'm wearing a cherry necklace
right now if you guys can't tell but I
don't know would that be too much to
wear together and again I love crop tops
because you can just wear them with high
waisted sweats and Misty shirt material
my gosh is so comfy this is the softest
material I've ever felt in my life it is
from the brand barefoot dreams this is
so perfect for fall and winter I swear
so I got my undersized one and it's just
this amazing white oversized sweatshirt
if you watched any of my hauls before
you know how much I love Reformation so
how amazing is this vintage looking
dress it's super comfy it's just a
ribbed material I can't talk
and I got any size extra small these are
fake buttons right here but they add to
the style super cool these look really
nice which really thick platform black
boots with a bunch of silver hardware on
it I got this really nice bondage I
don't know if that's what it's called
like a bondage dress like body con it's
super stretchy it is kind of ribbed even
though it is that bondage style it's
from the LF sale so I don't think you
can get this anymore but I just want to
throw this in there because you can
never have too many simple block dresses
I love this to talk about some shoes
done
I love these they're red fake leather
they're from dolls kill they're amazing
they're so comfortable it feels like
you're walking on if you're wearing flat
shoes but you're actually wearing heels
this is so distracting but I love that
look at the back zipper these are a
whole nother story these are actually
the perfect going-out boot casual boot
if you want to wear heels they're so
amazing and anytime I worn these out
already
every person called one seven it's like
where do I get those I'm like they're on
dolls kill but these are from dolls kill
as well and I just love the silver
zipper as the hardware and they just tie
up these these are from dolls kill as
well it's their current mood shoes but
these are so mintage it's almost like
you're in the movie clueless
I love these the plaid the colors are
amazing I'll probably end up wearing
these for Halloween which I'll probably
post a Halloween video soon so keep an
eye out for that thank you guys so much
