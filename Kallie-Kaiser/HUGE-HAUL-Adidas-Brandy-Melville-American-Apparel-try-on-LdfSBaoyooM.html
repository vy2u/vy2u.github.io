video I'm just gonna be sharing with you
guys everything I purchased in the past
month month and a half this is going to
be a huge haul video I could name all
the stores I bought the stuff on
recently but we're just gonna see when
we hold stuff up and tell you what it is
but I think I shopped at adidas American
Apparel Urban Outfitters Topshop ASOS
Nasty Gal Barney Melville and I think
that is it so we'll find out but
honestly don't have a lot of
high-waisted shorts so I got these just
like plain acid-wash looking ripped
high-waisted shorts from the brand
vibrant I got it at a boutique so the
store is only at this location but the
shorts brand is vibrant and I don't know
I just thought these were fun to wear
with t-shirts and for tailgates and just
anything you need to wear jean shorts
for I got this tennis skirt from
American Apparel I've seen people
purchase this skirt and photograph in it
I wanted it for the longest amount of
time and every time I go in American
Apparel I'm like I can't buy it I can't
buy it I wanted it so bad so I finally
just did it and I bought it I love
tennis skirts they're kind of like that
pleated finish and then this one's kind
of stiff it's like a thicker material
it's from American Apparel
and I got size extra small an American
Apparel I got this just like really cool
a mesh men's t-shirt it was in the sales
section I love the like mesh or holey
design if you guys can see it I thought
that was really sick these are so fun
they're from American Apparel they're
like shiny material and these are high
waisted short shorts but I just thought
they were super fun and cute to grab and
they were on sale at American Apparel I
got this super cool long-sleeve like
mesh sweatshirt I just thought this
would look really cool I mean I don't
I'm just gonna do with warmth because it
has holes in it but I think it's more
for the look of an outfit so I don't own
a lot of wild Fox items because they're
a bit pricier but I did go to a Saks
outlet store and they had this on sale
it was one of those like super stretchy
cozy wild Fox sweatshirts it's just
super soft it says sugar high I just
thought this was so cute for when I get
cold I got this super super cute just
like plain white scalloped design skirt
from Topshop now this is completely
tight like a pencil skirt and I'm just
in love with this it's so cute on I wore
this when I went through recruitment
recently everyone has been wearing
adidas clothing and sportswear so I
decided to pick some stuff up online on
adidas so I got this super cute just
like plain grey t-shirt with the pink
pastels all over it and this is just
perfect to wear to class and when it
gets cold I got some nice indeed
lightnings with the three striped
pattern down the leg and then it says
adidas down here by the ankle I am in
love with these I think they're really
really cool they're super comfortable
too so I picked up these like super
chill baby basketball shorts from adidas
I just thought they were really cool I
mean they were in the girls section even
though they kind of look like men's
shorts but I liked the grey design with
the pink pastel flowers all over it and
I just always want something cozy to
wear if you're doing homework or just
walking around campus
I didn't bring a lot of sweatshirts with
me to college so I had to get another
one so I got this one from ideas online
I got it on sale too and in the middle
there's snakes print snake print and I
love I'm obsessed with snake print right
now I think anything snake print is so
in and it's so cute so I recently picked
up this it's like a those leotards is
that make sense it pins down here and
then you wear it with like high-waisted
shorts and stuff and I just think this
is super cute and everyone has been
wearing these lately they're so in and
there's so much fun and then the back on
this tank top version just swoops down
and it's so pretty I love it this is
from Isabelle's cabinets I will leave a
link down below in my description box it
is in Newport Beach California I believe
but if you guys are looking for really
cute strappy like one pieces to wear
with shorts I would go on to their
website because they're not that
expensive from that same Isabel cabinet
I got in this long-sleeved version of
the crisscross design over your chest
and then this is a one-piece as well so
it looks great with skirts or high
waisted pants or jeans or shorts and
then this is long-sleeve and it's a rib
design so it's a bit stretchy and just
cozy in general this red dress that I
recently purchased is from Nasty Elle
and I am absolutely in love with the
scalloped design I mean everywhere I go
it's almost in every store that I see
this is so cute it has some really thick
straps and then it's kind of low-cut and
then the back is even lower than the
front and then there's like little
pockets on the sides on Nasty Gal
I picked up this super cool like
backless romper it's hard to describe it
on the camera and or even show it to you
on the camera thought of being on my
body but this goes behind my neck so
that it swoops down in the back and then
it's just shorts with a little trim on
the end and then it's a very low-cut
romper in the front and as well on the
back I don't know it's a really thin
material so you could still wear this
when it's super hot outside and not be
too warm at Urban Outfitters I got this
super cute like um it's like a
turtleneck dress and it's from the brand
Graham glamorous I know they sell them
on nasty L as well but it's kind of that
rib design but it's a bit the lines in
Arabic thicker and it's just super
stretching and tight this is a great
dress to wear out with heels or to
dinner at Urban I picked up this light
sweater it's just super big and cozy
uh-huh I got a size small it was in the
sale section because I don't know if it
was from a fall season or just summer
season it was on sale but it's perfect
to throw over basically anything if you
get chilly or something
at Urban Outfitters I got this really
cute lavender and light blue colored
romper and it's kind of like a overall
or I don't on that thread I would say
overall it has pockets and in the back
you can make them criss cross or go
straight I have them Chris Cross right
now so in the back what we criss cross
you could just wear like a t-shirt under
this or umbrella and it's super cute
with just sneakers at Urban Outfitters I
just got this loose bro tank that's grey
and a sizing medium so I could wear it
as a dress and I kind of just wear like
a sports bra underneath it to class with
sneakers or any bra let of course but
this is just super loose and lightweight
for living somewhere where it's really
hot at brandy melville online I got
these vodi shorts because I needed just
like plain black shorts super basic to
wear to class and around and be cozy so
these are essential I also got these
grey vodi shorts member any Melville
online because you can never have too
many shorts when you're living in the
desert and they're just so nice to wear
to class with t-shirts and stuff I also
just grabbed these pj shorts from brandy
melville online i thought they were cute
it's their bode design if you're
familiar with these but you can
literally wear these with anything and
that's why I like them in so many
different colors now that I'm living in
Arizona I got this cactus shirt from
brandy melville online it's just so cute
like with a little cactus embroidered on
the left shoulder or chest left chest
and I love it's just a cozy t-shirt to
have to wear to class I then got this
super plain gray ribbed tank top super
loose and cozy used to wear around I
thought this is great to layer brawl X
underneath and when it gets really hot
out or over a bikini I personally have
never owned a jean jacket so I finally
made an investment on a jean jacket and
this one's from American Eagle
Outfitters and I think it's just a size
small yes I small it has holes in it
with rips I just needed this because it
does get cold here at night sometimes or
a funeral on Twiter lay in tents air
conditioning this is great to have with
you my sister actually got me this skirt
for my bird
present which was August 13th but it's
from Tsavo skirt and it just says do fun
it with all these cool horizontal lines
and then the outlining of the sleeves
and neckline is maybe blue edgy crew
they had a sim and I got these in size
double zero they're just super fun pants
and they're kind of like business.you
looking if that makes sense
and then the bottoms are just it looks
great with heels and like a tight tank
top they are high waisted and they're a
bit large on me but they have pockets
and the band is elastic so there's no
zippers anywhere I just thought they
were sleek and cute for shoes recently I
got a light pink pair of Converse or a
hot pink however you want to say this
color but they were on sale and I just
thought they were great to have around
campus and then I got these in like a
forest green or like olive green color
these are just from Nordstrom Rack and
they were on sale as well I don't own
any just classic black booties so I made
an investment on these these are from
Dolce Vita I got them at Nordstrom Rack
and I love the like chic design on the
back right here it's just a bunch of
layers of leather just piled up and then
there's if urns on the side I got these
Steve Madden shoes at Nordstrom Rack as
well I just thought they were great
heels to have at the end of this summer
and they were on sale and then I love
just like the beads or studs if you want
to call them just up and down the ankles
I think that is so cute I went to this
store called last chance in Phoenix
Arizona oh my gosh it was insane their
sales or deals for like even designer
shoes are amazing but I got these like
cool leather snakeskin print shoes I've
never heard of this shoe brand it's
called J slides in New York City and I
just thought they were really cute
they're kind of that replica of those
Steve Madden shoes up if you've seen
them you know what I'm talking about
then got these Sam Edelman sandals that
are just black and strappy all over the
front of the feet on that last chance
and they were $13 so I'm obsessed with
these like hologram type design shoes or
just like I don't know this metallic
silver is going
but I got these at last chance as well
for so so cheap there michael kors as
well so these are very nice shoes for I
got them like 20 bucks it's insane but
yeah I thought these were so fun for
going out I already wore them out so
they're a bit scuffed a bit I also got
these hologram type shoes and they're
from Jeffrey Campbell but I got my last
chance so they were super super cheap
and then there's just a zipper going
down the back with a about a 2 inch heel
maybe two and a half inch and then my
shoe size is size 6 so all these are
either 6 or 6 and a half when I came
here I didn't have any purses really to
go out in so I got this one on Nordstrom
Rack comm it has two zippers going up
and down the back and then in the front
is kind of like a fake white leather and
then the entire course is just a big
white leather and this is just a satchel
or crossbody you want to call it and
then I got this super cute light pink
one on ASOS and then I love the little
fringe on the side and then this is just
a fake leather as well and that has a
little heart that says Murphy I've never
heard of Mark B London full of love but
on the inside has two zippers as well
and then it's just like a cheetah print
design on the inside I thought that was
so cute and then I got this cute blue
bag from Urban Outfitters in the sales
section and it just has this fringe on
the side I thought this was great if I
need a large purse I don't own any large
purses so if I need to carry my camera
around with me at all this works out
