I thought it'd be so fun to share with
you everything I purchased in the past
two weeks
wait hey guys it's Hal and for today's
video I would love to share with you
everything I purchased in the past two
to two-and-a-half weeks I also was in
San Diego this weekend which you would
know that if you followed me on my
Instagram which is at Cali Kaiser I was
on the beach because my best friend goes
to SDSU in San Diego and I went to visit
her and I went to the Aleph sale in La
Jolla that was so obnoxious um and I
also went to brandy melville because I
was in California so might as well and I
had a few jewelry pieces and some shoes
to share with you guys I cannot wait to
share this video with you I'm so excited
here we go so many of you got a comment
on my Instagram where I always get my
round ray-bans that are red eye if you
follow me on instagram you see that me
posting them way too often so I wanted
to get another color so I got this black
with silver rims I am obsessed with them
they're not polarized like my other ones
of these I probably would never choose
to drive in these just because it
doesn't cut the glare of the Sun but I
think these photograph amazing and I
love the way these look I don't know why
I'm obsessing over sunglasses oh so much
but obsessed and these are from ribbon
to talk about a few jewelry pieces I
picked up recently the first brand I'm
going to talk about is Lily clasp I am
obsessed with Millie clasp it came in
this super cute like wooden box so the
first thing I got is this 15 inch just
gold chain that's perfect for layering
um it's just a fitted adjustment length
which I love it's just super cute it
looks amazing layered with this other
necklace I got from Ali clasp I love
this charm so much it's this one's
actually choker so it goes like that the
rest of the jewelry I got is from brandy
melville so I got this pretty purple
beaded shimmery choker I love the way
this catches the light and
it matches my nails how fun and the next
one is a low rot lariat law rat just
this really pretty gold lariat necklace
with two different charms on the end and
in the middle and I love rainy mellows
jewelry it's so inexpensive and they
hold up for about a year I would say so
when I went to the LF sale I spent two
hours in that store because you have to
dig through piles and piles to find
exactly what you want but these were
just right in the front and I was so
excited to get one of these even though
this is kind of like a wintry Aztec II
design if that is that the right word
their Fall collection is known for this
lace up or threading design which I
absolutely adore you can make this if
you go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels so
easy but they just do it great and I
love the designs and the graphic tees
that they put them on but I love this
sweater as well and I think this will be
great for next winter probably my
favorite or versatile thing that I
picked up at the ls sale was probably
this black tank top
it's just spaghetti straps it's the
brand Emma and Sam I got the size extra
small and if you look closely there's
just a hole in the front so if you want
your chest to show it can look really
cute kind of sexy I don't know um yeah
so I love how simple and delicate this
tank top is and I'll probably wear this
every day for the rest of my life
so festival season is coming up so much
faster than I thought and I have been
trying to get outfits together for the
longest time because I'm going to
Coachella and I could not wait I'm
literally so so so psyched but I got
this super cute bra left at LFT and I'm
hoping to wear this to a child with some
sick like black jean shorts I know I've
been trying to get most my outfits
together let me know if you guys want to
see a Coachella vlog outfits I did one
for Lollapalooza and the comments you
guys really liked them so comment down
below and let me know if you guys would
want to see a video I fact obviously
also share with you guys my
it's on my Instagram which is just at
Kelly Kaiser if you want to check that
out but yeah um I've been like trying to
get outfits together super quickly and
I'm so happy I found this and it was on
sale it's just so beautiful I love it
the lace detail underneath the bust the
velvet and then the fringe I just am all
about it I love I got this super basic
ribbed tank top it has slits on both
sides so it's very elongated it's kind
of a high-neck tank top but it has
pretty wide armpit holes which I like um
yeah I totally dig this I think it's so
simple and it's going to be so nice to
wear in the summer with shorts I am
obsessed with bra let's so I got this
really cool acid wash graver all that
from lft as well I don't know how to
describe this so it's crisscross like
this and in the back it has these metal
circles that hold the design together
but this looks amazing on I took some
photos in this in San Diego which I will
show right here but yeah it's so so cute
and this is super stretchy and it was on
sale this squirt skirt whatever you want
to call this is probably my favorite
thing that I got at the LF sale I mean
look at how cute this is it's like that
letter like envelope design right here
and then it's this grey suede which is
so so beautiful let me see the brand its
indica indica indica brand and I'm not a
size 6 so it must be Australian because
Australian sizing is 6 which is extra
small I've picked up this top at brandy
Melville it's super super lovely it just
ties in the front and it's silky so you
can wear this as pajamas if you wanted
to the sleeves are structured as you can
see so when you wear it it kind of
peplums out if that makes sense
and then the back is completely plain
this goes down to my waistline if I was
wearing low-rise jeans so I love the way
it fits
um they post this top all the time with
girls wearing it on their Instagram so I
just had to get it obviously I love it I
got two graphic tees from brandy
melville which I absolutely adore they
almost are exactly like lft's
first-of-a-kind brand graphic tees how
they have rips on the top um if you guys
can see from up there
and then it's just a big comfy t-shirt
with pretty thick cotton material and
then the sleeves are ripped as well this
is just a Led Zeppelin t-shirt I wanted
a Led Zeppelin fancy for so long so I'm
really excited to own this now and then
I got this Jimi Hendrix one loved image
he's wearing like headphones it's black
and white and then this is also
destroyed on the sleeves and the collar
I got these it's super stretchy most
comfortable sweatpants ever from brandy
melville as well they obviously stretch
like crazy bitters this cool in between
Heather and charcoal grey color what I
really am confused about is the length
of the bottoms they're uneven what so to
talk about denim I picked up some denim
the first pair of shorts since it's
starting to get really hot here in
Arizona like I think today is 90 degrees
I'm such an exaggerator I think today is
like 80 degrees still super insane
awesome love it so I got these shorts
they're one teaspoon if you know the
brand um they're the combine banded
shorts I got size 22 I know that sounds
like crazy small but they're shorts run
so BAE so yeah I am obsessed with these
I love them I wore them to the beach and
they're I feel like they're really
durable denim I love the phrase on the
ends near the booty and I like how your
butt does not show in these so if you
wear them you can either make them
high-waisted or lowey's depending on
your size and your butt should not hang
out of these which is really really good
then I got these cool low-rise ripped at
the knees charcoal grey dark denim these
are from car Mart got them on line
our denim they had a $68 sale and I was
so psyched to pick these up
Ella sells karma as well so I got the
the carb our jeans on sale with rips the
knees I have never seen denim this color
before obviously it's not that um it's
not it is denim but it's a different
color so I got this super cool color
it's like this dirty tan is what you
described it I don't know I'm obsessed
with these this looks amazing with a
white tank top honestly so sit love them
and then I just got your everyday basic
high-waisted really really sleek clean
skin tight black jeans which I'm really
psyched about I feel like this is even a
gray black.i
let me know but I got these in size 25
as well
and I love them by far boys clothes more
than I should but I love boys clothes
and I think boys clothes has the best
comfy or sporty clothes or style I just
have to say so it packs on they had a
sale so I bought two boys sweatshirts of
course this one is just coupe super cool
knit hoodie love it black I got it in a
medium super cozy looks really great
with jeans and some Nike or adidas shoes
with the denim and then I got this lion
nutty in a size medium as well look at
just if the design is just spot-on love
it I wish this was in the girls section
but it doesn't matter because this is
totally unisex I've already worn this
shirt before but I just had to share it
in this video because I did recently get
it oh I had it tied so if you're
wondering what this is it's just this
super cool baby blue adidas logo with a
white t-shirt and then I am obsessed
with it I love it so much for anyone
