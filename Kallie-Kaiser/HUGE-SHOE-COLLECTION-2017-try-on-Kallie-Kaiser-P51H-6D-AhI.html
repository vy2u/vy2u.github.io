going to show you guys my shoe
collection this video on my boss is so
requested aside for my apartment tour
which I will be showing you guys very
soon
so sorry about that wait but I'm very
excited for my shoe collection today I
don't all really how to approach this
video and I had no idea on these shoes
that actually had until I brought them
all out I'm just going for the shoes
pretty quickly just because we would be
here forever if I talked way too much
about them so I was well to get in this
video if you guys want to follow me my
Instagram is that Kelly Kaiser but
without further ado here we go I have
been living in these boots lately
there's patent leather shiny black
addicted there platform for the making
it taller which is just the best thing
ever
they're really narrow which is perfect
because I see our super narrow on if you
guys can shuffle from right there but no
on aqueous data CDs Shelley's London is
a little bit more of an expensive shoe
brand I got these with different uh
North Sean's I know they still so it's
on an adult chill I'm pretty sure
evolved Nordstrom I seen SEO pulling out
of business which is so sad that they
saw on there too I am currently addicted
to the black patent leather Trent I
bought the young princess Polycom these
are amazing I've been wearing them out
if I were to dinner or go out to the
nice girl anything like that
they're perfect still comfortable I
actually didn't even have to break these
in I didn't get any blisters you just
wear them with soft and ready to go the
issues I think are pretty badass there's
a kuma Fenty's I got them in the orange
camo I have to search the internet to
find these two I finally found on eBay
my size I got them in a size six and a
half and they do run true to size
they're so comfortable I definitely got
my money out of these because I wear
them so often to school they're really
comfortable and you guys can't tell if
has them for about six months now
there's no there's no damage to them at
all if I have to grab a pair of sandals
as I'm going out to dinner or lunch or
anything whether it's casual or fancy I
will always reach for these they are
Jeffrey Campbell I have to leave Jeffrey
Campbell shoes I love
simple shoes so there's a black lace-up
they don't remember the exact name of
these shoes but amazing shoes if you
don't own these you need to find them on
the internet and buy them these are
definitely more on the obnoxious amazing
fun side of my shoe collection which I'm
obsessed fees they're the yru branch so
if you've checked them out of four
why are you has the craziest most dope
shoes you could ever find on the
Internet today I love them I just can
see they just glow and that is what
everyone needs of your life
every year I believe Topshop comes out
with a brand new black bootie that's
came in with classic or staple for
people's closets so two years ago I
bought this one I believe was the
Midnight Rider boo or something but
every time I wear these people oil and
where they're from they're from Topshop
amazing damn booth leather at the top
which I love
quaint oh you guys can see how worn in
these are I've definitely got my money
worth out of these they haven't broken
all the guys and they're so comfortable
these are definitely one of the best
boots I have in my shoe collection today
they are Jeffrey Campbell I got on Nasty
Gal I think in the fall on sale I'm in
love with them they're amazing I haven't
worn them enough but look at this silver
hardware you cannot get enough of this
this is so amazing they look good if you
just have a really tight all-black
outfit on the tie which is genius or
maybe like a black crop top and a
leather jacket these are everything last
time I showed these Jeffrey Campbell in
a hole someone said this was a satanic
star which hi I'm not thinking that is I
think this is a fashionable song I love
it so we're just going to go with that
they are black leather they're super
shiny and gloss which I love and then
they just have a silver and red star in
the middle they're beautiful so I do
need to share that I own these these are
probably one of my absolute favorite
sandals that I own just because you can
throw them on and they match anything I
love it the red stones with the studs
the star does everything it's just
amazing their girly but hot and edgy at
the same time they're really high
quality about them I'm juju ssam and
these are Jeffrey Campbell as well
for probably my first pair of really
expensive shoes I actually bought for
myself it was probably two weeks after I
started my youtube channel and I put
them in my favorites video without even
trying them on um I've had it for almost
three years now they're amazing
Salmonella memories obsessed shoes I
bought them for $90 which I'm so
thankful now because I totally got the
money out of them and I will will never
run a style they were so chic and fun I
love beans are one of my LG favorite
Jeffrey Campbell boots I think these
were one of my first Jeffrey Campbell
smoothie so I could be wrong
I bought them more than 24/7 I wanted to
go cello which I don't know how I did
but they just cut at the ankle really
nicely and you can send around the wire
at the top it was really nice once
they're worn in and the silver hardware
seems to fade all and really nicely I
owe a lot of debt for Campbell booties
and I recently been obsessed with the
color red I did use these in the summer
so you might have seen them in a hole
then these silver hardware on these are
absolutely insane
so stunning these are B brand all black
one of the most comfortable booties I've
ever worn in my entire life plus the
cheetah is just so thrilling it's still
fun to just throw these on your feet if
you're wearing one color outfit you're
wearing all black all white it was
really great as a statement piece and
the heel is really nice about 1/2 2
inches I love these shoes they're just
so beautiful and I always get such nice
compliments when I wear them these are
my tennis shoes I customized them on
nike.com because when you use these came
out I was so in love with how they were
all one color so I need these all grey
on line I actually love them I believe
there's a rose design but you can't even
customized Nike to whatever color you
want so I highly recommend you
that if you don't dig any of their other
styles for some more sneakers I just
have some converse looking pairs so
these are actually tough I love a good
pair of chucks these are the off-white
cream color I wasn't a Lollapalooza so
they got a little bit dirty and it's a
little bit of clean sense if you look
way nicer now with the black rim love it
and then these are the Frye brand and
they hands if earth up in the back with
leather laces obsessed they come dirty I
didn't dirty to use they come disparity
I have an obsessive answer the longest
times I'll try and find these online
within lol but I damaged I got them
ignore some whereas with 20 bucks the
colors amazing I think these are a
little bit more of a thicker fit than
discipline classics but I can't wait to
wear these with shorts I'm addicted I do
own a pair of Birkenstocks oh my gosh I
would live in these quick hood I love
them so much so I flip these on whatever
we're going to Beach anything like that
class go and pick up some packages down
by the mail room with mom goes elevator
love these these aren't a really good
investment
I know they're expensive so worth it
great purchase I keep the dress in the
bag because I love them so much so these
are from Jeffrey Campbell as well these
are more of a newer purchase they have a
dinner base with amazing patches I don't
have their sewed on yes there definitely
sewed on with these glitzy silver studs
all around and then the zipper doesn't
actually get done faked a zipper is over
here but I was Tessa peas I can't get
enough of them they're so photogenic
they're more photogenic than any should
have ever seen in my life
I mean for part of their new spring
season so these are quite fairly new and
I bet you find them on the Jeffrey
Campbell website these are a really
lovely pair of ankle boots they have
they're really pointy I don't know if
they're too pointy and they're
definitely more of a western style so
they have C on that so obviously it was
a must
they're from Free People I really wanted
to do those a little bit more flattered
because all my boots kind of have a bit
of it you like this one so again
something they're fun they're a really
nice leather material really
high-quality
another pair of shoes I got three people
are these awesome platform
there that torque or wooden look I would
say they just have really nice leather
straps going on the front of the seat
and around the ankles and then they kind
of do a lace up around the leg depending
on how you decide to lace it up these
are not narrow enough I do need to even
take it in or something you guys will
see when I try them on they're just a
little bit bigger on my feet what you'll
see with a lot of my shoes because I
really don't know the mistakes or
six-and-a-half it's just the kind of
public brands Jeffrey Campbell makes
amazing booties you guys have seen
different handle booties in my halls
before so these are just really nice
they're an amazing color with some
silver hardware on the front and back
really nice wooden heel with a nice
structure going on I love the holes on
the front I do wear socks with these I
wear crew necks off because you can't
really see them and some pairs of your
soft shell there's other things to worry
about the world you're in another pair
of a Jeffrey Campbell booties these are
the Dobby it's unbelievable Dobis I
could be wrong they just have a really
nice lacing on the side but it's more of
a stretchy interior like elastic if that
makes sense these are a bit narrow so I
love love the way these look at my legs
and feet they're not bad expr which is
why I love them so much looks really
little short great purchase
oh it has a piece of hair these are
absolutely amazing the hardware is so
stunning I love how there's little
buckles all entire ankles so deployment
hands you have to show you guys what it
looks like so just dressed up like that
I got these on nasty all really
inexpensive shoe
I don't know also say about them except
for how long they are these are the
coconut and the tea sandals I'm obsessed
I love anything snakeskin I don't think
it will grow out of loving snakeskin or
at the moment I want a gray fringes all
up and they laced all the way up the
ankles they make your legs really
elongated and so does new stuff ever
and make you light is really nice I
haven't worn it yet but I did get them
this past winter and I think they're
everything more seasoned a CL they are
the camp announced that but they're
amazing they're just the snakeskin fuel
with gold circles that help waste up the
entire foot so these will also make you
look a lot taller asleep fuels are
really tall you guys are ever looking
for a pair of saucepans like these I
don't think the public desire public
desire is a nice company you have to
check them out they're amazing so these
are not very pointed code if they're
like a rounded front that makes sense
so comfortable fully how if you light is
perfect for me I won't go any higher
than this I don't think I crazy because
I used to wear really really high heels
and I was addicted to shoes I've always
had an obsession with shoes
I think shoes are everything but I
probably won't go higher than these here
is another pair of amazing snakeskin
shoes these are from public desire
obsessive cultures are they actually
surprised me with these
I didn't pick these out but they know me
so well as I have to get my mail
something that's weird
I didn't pick out anything from public
desire and I didn't know we were
collabing this month obsessed we draw
anything in the best company I love
these how about fun are these I got them
at Zara on sale they were around 20
bucks and I'm out there online or in
stores anymore which I apologize because
they're amazing if you ever need to be a
space alien or something for Halloween
you're set
these are thumbs are as well they're so
fun they just have this faux fur going
on the front strap above the toe and
then they have a super smallest heel so
if you don't really like to walk around
in heels or you don't like height these
are perfect for you these will be your
best friend any time I've ever posted
these on Instagram wore them in a video
ever annoys asked what style of aadhi
aadhi oz or adidas these are however you
guys choose to pronounce beat it I
believe there's a tad ease brands
I'll put right here what style these are
obsessed favorite sneakers I wear these
probably every day in the summer
I have to wear sneakers a lot in the
winter so I can't wait for spring or
summer and I can wear these again
they are from Vince they have an amazing
a skin texture all around plus this
lavender and gray color is everything
and they do have a little bit of height
and you guys can see the white platform
on the bottom I did hit that blisters
breaking me there but once you break
them in never regret buying them I do
own a lot of black movies the scenes are
a little bit more of a different style
than I'm used to
they're really short so if I wear these
socks with them you can definitely see
the top of it is that I sense they're
really simple all really fun they are
the sole Santa branch I did you'd be
Nessa lsj I think last season but really
comfortable really good leather to
forever 21 has really nice boots this
season so I got a pair of flat over the
knee and then Allah I mean heels over
the boots they're both ways they go high
over the knees it was really good when
you wear a skirt or shorts with anything
that open any soft or tight so you guys
can just see how nice these are I
definitely style these and look books
before so you might have seen it on my
channel bed but I love them seeing that
Madden stage life so obviously these are
Steve Madden they have such good prices
when their shoes are on sale I think it
needs four on sale I don't think I've
ever paid full price for pair of Steve
Madden
love them like they were shoes the studs
are amazing they're also that rocker
really look so comfortable I don't wear
heels anymore I only buy thick fueled
sandals that make sense
and you will never go wrong I promise
these really fun crushed velvet boots
are from guided they have an awesome
silver steel going on I love anything
that's really metallic or different not
a lot of people wear either really
comfortable I hadn't worn these a lot
yet but any hope I can ran into the
spring the really wintry and holiday-ish
to me I might just have to save them for
next year thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch this video I love
you all so much
have an amazing day or night whenever
you decide to watch this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
