I have a really exciting spring Tryon
clothing haul to share with you guys I
think you guys are gonna really love the
pieces in this haul
everything will be linked down below in
the description box and you guys have
any questions just leave comments down
below but I'm really excited to get in
this video so if you're gonna follow me
on my Instagram it is just at Cali
Kaiser but here we go
okay the first brand I have some clothes
to share with you guys are from redone
denim or shock redone I am absolutely
obsessed with this brand I'm wearing
this sweatshirt which you guys probably
have already seen in a previous haul but
the first piece of clothing that I have
from them this skirt has I have no words
for this skirt it is the cutest items
here I've ever seen slash worn in my
life it just looks like this I haven't
filmed a haul in a while so I'm probably
gonna be awkward at holding things up
but no redone is the only denim I wear
I'll show you guys the jeans I have
these are they're just classic high rise
original stovepipes
I believe I wear a size 24 in these they
just look like this they're so
flattering you guys will be able to tell
in the Tryon portion and then the
bottoms look like this so they're not
skinny but they're not bootcut and they
are kind of crop so they look really
good with like white tennis shoes and
some higher socks I love when socks
stick out of tennis shoes and these are
their high-rise stovepipe originals as
well and I am just obsessed probably my
favorite thing from redone is this
unreal denim jacket I'm in love with it
it's a Croft one looks unreal with denim
on denim and jeans I thought - a small
it is reconstructed from a Levi's denim
jacket but I don't know speechless I
don't know what to say about it's just
so amazing okay and then this sweatshirt
that I'm wearing right now is the same
style as this but it's pink and it says
girl on it and it's dope I love this I
got mine in a size small this cotton is
unreal it's so comfortable it looks
great with just throwing it on with
jeans it's super casual this I'm
obsessed with because it is
redone cotton t-shirt but in a bodysuit
version right here's the next top I'm
absolutely in love with it oh my gosh
also this is the best cotton I've ever
felt and more in my whole life their
t-shirts are absolutely amazing I have
another one to share with you guys but I
love the graphic how it says redone in
pink
it's just long-sleeve and it looks like
this okay the next thing I have to share
with you guys from redone is this
adorable yellow t-shirt I love anything
colorful and neon these days I don't
know why I'm so obsessed ok the next top
I own I kind of splurged on this I got
it from the brand or Sun iris I could be
pronouncing that wrong but they are an
Instagram they have gorgeous clothes
they are expensive
I definitely splurged when I got this
but I'm absolutely in love and I hope I
keep it forever and have it in archives
so this is from American deadstock
I believe and how unreal is this cheetah
skirt I'm in love with it so comfy and
then I'm gonna wear it with this
gorgeous Wow gorgeous for love and
lemons top it's so it's like a
highlighter it's like super Sheen and
dual chrome I love it I just ties in the
front or you can tie it whatever way you
like I did get this in a size extra
small if you want to know their size
guys this is really fun I just got it's
from Zara it's one of it's just a green
plaid schoolgirl skirt
it's high-waisted I love the chains
across the front I really just got this
like it came in the mail today I've been
trying to collect a few more dresses I
can wear sneakers with and I found this
one on dolls kill it has watermelons all
over it it's so pretty and flowy I
normally don't own such girlie pieces
but when you wear it with tennis shoes
it's just so comfortable like how can
you not this top is from dolls kill as
well I am totally getting back into my
yellow trend I am in love with it I feel
like whenever the weather gets warmer I
tend to wear yellow more but this is a
really fun fuzzy sweater that I just
have been wearing quite a bit and it
looks great with jeans or just like
black patent leather pants this is from
doll scale as well so if anyone's been
looking for vibes like
this goat adults kill so it is this
underneath bustier that kind of just
sits under here and you can wear it with
a really cool vintage tee or something
but it is a snakeskin dress it's super
stretchy and comfortable okay I am
absolutely in love with this dress it's
so springy the purple color is gorgeous
it's from the brand realization I got
mine in a size extra small in case you
guys are looking at the size guide but I
love this I've been outfit repeating
this dress a lot and I love wearing a
long sleeve or a turtleneck underneath
it I've been trying to purchase more
beachy clothing because I do live closer
to the ocean and a lot of people dress
very beachy here so I picked up this
sweater it's from dolls kill I love it
it's super flowy and oversized on the
sleeves which I love it I like that it
just hangs on the body you can throw it
on with a tank top underneath I love it
this is from dolls kill as well I'm
dying to wear this with just all white
even white shoes I think it would be
really cool I have a really nice pair of
white denim jeans that I think would
look cute with a white bodysuit and then
this just over on top it's so fuzzy and
cozy I mean this is so casual you could
just wear this to college everyday I saw
this on dolls kill and I don't own a lot
of just really nice summer spring
dresses that I can kind of just throw on
so I wanted to do this I thought it
would look really cute with no bra
because it's a thick material but it's
not too thin that you're always nipping
through but it looks like this I love it
there's a gorgeous lace slit near the
bottom and this is kind of more of a
creamy color it looks more white online
but it's not it's from dolls kill as
well I haven't worn this yet but I'm so
excited it's just a really cute crop top
from dolls kill it wasn't even that
expensive and I'm obsessed with yellow
so I had to buy it
okay so dolls kill sent this two-piece
um this may be the most gorgeous thing
you've ever seen in your life but it's
so fun someone has to wear this to
Coachella I already have planned most of
my outfit
but if this one happens to sneak and I
fall in love with this more than one of
my other outfits you might be seeing me
wear the SEC Coachella so this is just a
high-waisted blue flame mesh see-through
Black banded skirt oh my gosh it doesn't
go too low it is longer but it's not
crazy length I swear and it comes with
this matching bra let have you ever seen
something so hot and then I also got
this bikini from dolls kill it's
literally like a cotton candy sherbert
sorbet sunset dream uh-huh yeah I'm
obsessed I can't wait to wear bikinis
again and go swimming in the ocean you
know I've been trying to buy a wetsuit
so that my friends and I can go swimming
in the ocean and stand the temperatures
because it was really cold right now so
if anyone recommends any good wetsuits
maybe on Amazon hit me up ok these are
from dolls kill as well I've been
wearing them all the time they are from
their current mood brand they came with
one of the packages that they sent me
and thank you so much dolls kill I
literally could cry I love these so much
and then as well from 411 lemons I was
thinking about wearing this shirt to
Coachella and then I don't know people
just keep coming out with more clothes
that are just so amazing so I keep
buying more things because I don't know
what I'm wearing yet but yes I am going
to Coachella and how gorgeous is this
top I have the matching bra that to show
you guys like what it goes with as well
but it just looks like this it's white
embroidered with these gorgeous floral
flowers okay so here's the design it's
so gorgeous these are a little bit dusty
because I haven't worn them in like two
weeks and I guess dust accumulates
quickly in two weeks but these are from
unis I'm absolutely in love with them
they're just black patent leather boots
but I didn't own any like this because
the toe isn't pointed it's just like a
round feature has a really good heel and
a platform and then the cute Uniflow go
is just on the back of the
which I love okay I have this skirt from
unit I'm absolutely in love with it's
yellow so how could I not be obsessed
here it's a super miniskirt I might be
wearing this to Coachella as well but I
don't want to spoil any more outfits if
you guys have watched my hauls in the
past you know 411 lemons it's like one
of my favorite brands of all time and I
got a swimsuit from them and I already
wore it to Spring Break I might if you
guys follow me on instagram you probably
already saw it in a photo but it's just
this gorgeous lavender bustier top
obviously there's no push up but it does
have underwire and then here's what the
bottoms look like I'm obsessed they're
high-waisted they look like this and it
comes with this matching coverup skirt
that you kind of just throw on over the
bottoms I feel like someone should wear
this to Coachella it's such a cute set
like even not just as a swimsuit so I
see Frankie's bikinis all over Instagram
and I've always wanted to buy one but
they're so expensive and then I finally
bought one and I'm this swimsuit quality
is absolutely insane I have never worn a
more comfortable swimsuit I love it but
I just got this from the rib collection
I'm not sure I don't know a bunch about
this swimwear company but oh my gosh
this is first of many swimsuits and then
I have some pieces from are you am I to
share with you guys that I was able and
very lucky enough to pick out so thank
you so much
are you like these are so gorgeous okay
so the first top that I have to share
with you guys is this tank top and then
as you guys can see there's a little bit
of fabric like a triangle formation
sticking up I love how they made it look
like there's a to top over tank next top
love this I wore it the other day it's
just a great basic
and it has a gorgeous smooth neck but
it's not too low-cut that anything is
showing if you don't I mean but just
looks like this I got it miss nice extra
small if you were wondering about their
size guide it's super stretchy
it's crazy comfy fabric I'm loved this
is sick I love this to wear with like
denim jeans or just an all-white outfit
would be really cool but there's the
gold hardware on the top and then the
back just looks like this it's kind of
low-cut which is really flattering to
whatever body type you have I also got a
gorgeous just simple chic choker and I
really like their packaging for their
jewellery this is a gorgeous box and it
just says are you a my across it
okay this hoodie is absolutely unreal it
is from the brand stay cool and I'll
have it linked down below for you guys
in the description box
I think it's stay cool Inc I'm
absolutely in love with this color and
then it has an amazing embroidered
design on the actual hoodie which is
really sick this piece is definitely one
my favorites is from Lambert's store
I'll make sure to link it down below the
description box for you guys but I love
the structure of it it's cropped and
then it goes longer in the back
obviously long sleeve just a cute
sweater I can't wait to wear it more
these jeans are from Lambert as well I
love the tag the way that they saw them
at the top and then how cool are these
athletic stripes that go all the way
down the denim jeans these are crazy
high waist and they're great they are
boyfriend fit on me which I love feel
like you guys have been wanting to know
where I get a lot of my high-waisted
sweatpants so these are my newest ones
then from Planet blue they're the brand
spiritual gangster that is a cool team I
got mine in size extra small and they
have rainbows going down the leg I got
it at Planet Blue it is a candle that
says inhale tacos exhale negativity
I had a gift card to free people and I
saw this online and I thought it would
be cute to wear with white socks and
some like Nike Air Force Ones or just
any sneakers that you guys own and look
how effortless this is you kind of just
throw it on put some really cool dope
long gold necklaces maybe some big
earrings I bought these recently from
love AJ I'm obsessed with them I can

an elastic waistband and then we'll
click this misses it furs on the back
there from dolls kill but they are blank
NYC and I did get a size 25 everyone
knows how obsessed I am with dolls kill
so I do spend a lot of money on dolls
kill and then they did send me a few
pieces but I'm absolutely loved like

that patent leather but they're pink I

haven't seen these but I got these I
bought these for myself for Christmas
around December and I'm actually in love
with them they're just a really nice
leather boot I got them on Nordstrom's

on the person I feel like people
pronounce it differently but I'm in love
with them they're just simple black
boots I wear them with dresses
sweatpants everything so these are
absolutely a statement I'm obsessed with
them I think it was really cool to even
wear with white socks and then some of
the degreed on denim jeans I showed you
guys earlier oh I'm sorry
they're so cute I know this pair might
not be for everyone but I am truly in
love with these I think they are so cool
so this is what they look like
I'm obsessed it's kind of like a
neoprene material for the outside the
shoe and then this is like a hard foam
ok these are absolutely unreal shout out
to Natalie Jacobson for letting me copy
her she wore these shoes when she was
staying with

those the things now I love you I
totally copied her and bought the same

purchased from their newer collection

owned

favorite color ever and then I got these
really cool gcd s high-waisted or I
don't even know if they're high-waisted
but they're leggings they're camo
they're gorgeous they have embroidery
around the knee and it just says GCD s
this is also from GCD s as well I got it

black maybe I'm not sure you guys can
figure it out but here's what the top
looks like and then the bottoms just
look like this it's so easy to throw on
it's comfy so my little sister Amy
showed me this brand it is
ten deep so I went on on her website and
they have insanely cool sweatshirts I'm
in love so this is the first one they
also have matching sweatpants to this
but I was unlucky and they didn't have
my size so I couldn't get it but here's
what the sweatshirt looks like it's just
a bunch of different color blocking and
fabrics going on I got - size medium
it's so cozy and then here is this one
which is also just amazing it's a bunch
of different shades of blue just sewn
into the sweatshirt and I got this in a
size medium as well I got this in the
men's section on Urban Outfitters
I love it it's amazing it says Jamaica
and then there's an embroidery of gold
thread of just a female laying across
the words this is also from the men's
section like the graphic tee men's
section and Urban Outfitters and it says
slow your roll and there's bananas
chillin in this dope little convertible
how amazing I could wear this every day
if I tried at reformation vintage but it
also is a graphic tee and I'm so in love
with it
um just looks like this love the colors
super neon super in and I mostly just
wear it with leather pants these are the
true leather pants from Nordstrom like
four years ago but if you Poshmark
trouve leather leggings they will pop up
because people are selling them because
I already bought a pair in case these
ever break because they're my favorite
leggings I've ever owned in my life ok
this is my newest shadow Hill sweatshirt
it's one of the half as it's not half
sibs full zips whatever you want to call
this match shirt but it just has writing
