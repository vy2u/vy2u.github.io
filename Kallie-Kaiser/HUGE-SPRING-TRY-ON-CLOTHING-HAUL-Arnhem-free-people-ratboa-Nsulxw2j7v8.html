it's Talon for today's video we have
another try and clothing haul honestly I
don't know how this has happened
everything just started to pile up and
now here we are so if you want to follow
me on my Instagram is Italia Kaiser but
without further ado here we go I really
don't know where to start but 20 minutes
ago I was at American Apparel I wanted
to hit their sale before there are
stores officially closed down and I know
I don't need another swimsuit but we
don't sale so it's justified I got this
amazing high waisted one piece two
pieces of bikini the bottom look like
this are these full coverage I really
don't know at this point that they're
all way they have sheen to them I have a
spray chin right now that's why I
probably look so tanned I use loving tan
for self-tanner I just had to get my
first shoot and then I wear size small
in the bottom and then the top is a size
extra small this fit so well I love it
and then at American Apparel as well I
got this awesome trench looking coat
it's just all black it's not suede
material but it's almost there pretty
close to that type of material if you're
wondering and it's kind of thin I don't
understand extra small/small and it was
50% off so you know I had to invest
also a lot of you may not know but 411
lemons is probably one of my favorite
clothing companies ever just because
look at how beautiful this is I haven't
hung up on a hanger just because holding
not doesn't do it justice so it comes
with this amazing really long felt that
you can loop around multiple times and
then how little roses on it the same
roses are attached to this see-through
material right here and it's just
amazing Beach cover-up but you can
totally wear it as a dress as well just
is really girly and beautiful it's all
white I hope I don't get it dirty and I
got - size extra small this is a really
beautiful two-piece it's all white and
this is the thickest cotton material
I've ever sell is so nice it's kind of a
ribbed sweater but you're also the
the brand Toby Hart ginger it's an
Australian brand and shipping with
honestly so quick it came here within
five or six days here's what the top
looks like this buttons up all the way
but I kind of just unbuttoned it because
I like it a little bit more open and I
saw this on Instagram and I had to have
it so I bought it I got it aside extra
small for the bottoms and a small visit
on the next few pieces I have to share
with you guys are all from the same
company called Arnhem clothing they are
an amazing bohemian fashion label
they're from Australia which I feel
makes everything better
I am so excited I'll try everything on
and I'll make sure to link down below
their Instagram and all the pieces I'm
about to show you so the first piece I
have to share you guys from them is this
gorgeous vert red color oh it matches
the lips on my wall perfectly the straps
are adjustable which is so nice I got -
has extra small which is a size 6 if it
is Australian sizing it just has leaves
on a sweetheart neck which looks so
beautiful and it isn't mini dress which
just makes everything better you guys
will see all that this looks in the
Tryon part okay you guys know I'm
obsessed with swimsuits so this is the
most beautiful bustier or bra let style
its ribs I got - size 8 which is a size
small and it fits me so perfectly this
material so thick and so nice whereas
bikini bottoms these are the bottoms how
amazing they kind of sit up higher on me
which I love you can also put them at a
normal hip tini or um bikini bottom the
back is a little cinched at the booty
which I love this isn't a size 8 which
is a size small as well so I love the
criss crossing of the rib design right
here I think it's so cute I cannot wait
to wear this in Cancun oh my gosh so I
haven't buttoned up right now but when
you unbutton it you can completely have
it hang on your body it just has
gorgeous embroidery on the sleeves and
all up and down the chest this one is
considered kind of an maxi kind of goes
to my ankles and this looks so good with
a bathing suit also the best part is it
comes with a black slip how many think
you could wear this out on the town at
night if you're feeling it and it also
comes with
is on the side so if you want to make it
a little bit of a tighter on your waist
it looks even better I got a really
similar style to that in white so here's
what the slit looks like in white so
gorgeous this is a size 6 I got a size 6
for both of these which is extra small
and then the dress portion but you can
also wear it a swimsuit cover-up looks
like this I'm going to unbutton it for
you guys you can get a better sense of
what it looks like this is what it looks
like unbuttoned a little bit the
embroidery on it is so exquisite I just
love this I love how it comes with these
belt type so you can tie it any way you
want I love anything that's versatile is
personally just my face next thing I got
is this amazing white chain top I you
guys can see I'm tying it right now I
love when you can wear tank tops either
down or tied and make it a cross look
this looks so good with highway sit down
or high-waisted black jeans I also love
the white lace or the white embroidery
on the top of this this is a really
lightweight material so comfy love it
these are probably my new favorite thing
yes these do look like really small
shorts they are knit sweater material
high-waisted shorts
I literally just wore these two hours
ago for a photo shoot dancing around in
the field in Malibu and these looked and
photographed so beautifully you can also
totally wear this with some cool tights
and high boots or just on the beach or
the sweater oh I love this about - size
six which is an extra salt this has a
lot of holes in it so it's definitely
not going to keep you warm so it's all
four looks it is exquisite I got this on
rat and boa which if you're looking
somewhere to buy Coachella outfits you
need to go onto rat and boa they have
amazing stuff also I have a Coachella
lookbook coming you can tie it either as
a halter or I kind of just tie it
through the straps that hang up in the
back I really don't know how it's
supposed to be time just because on the
website they don't have a picture of it
back shown you guys will be able to see
how it fully looks on the trend portion
but it's just this gorgeous lace
embroidered dress this is to die for I
am
beginning to love the color yellow I
think it's just so exquisite on every
person skintone so this is vintage it
says while fuck's on it with really
thick black strap I face vintage I
actually don't know when this came out
but I got it wasteland which is a
secondhand designer store in California
and it's amazing I think it's a size
small but if you could find us on lines
left your heart you need to buy it I
also want an amazing pair of sunglasses
I got them at wasteland as well there
were twenty dollars and it makes me see
the world in yellow everyone has been
wearing these Styles lately either out
to clubs or just during the day as a
fashion piece
I love non prescription glasses as a
fashion statement I think they look so
cool also out of every good could tell
but I recently brought into my hair to
kind of a white blonde and these glasses
make the entire look just look killer so
I'm just going to be wearing these every
day
this bag is my life I'm obsessed with
small size backpacks so this is actually
so perfect for me it is from Free People
it was only 40 dollars finally something
that wasn't overpriced
I already got my money out of it just
because I use this every single day and
what's so nice about it is so it has one
strap and you just alter it like this
you wear on your bag or you can put it
as a satchel and wear it like so I went
to a sample sale for stone cold fox
blintz guy and Jen's pirate beauty and
then there was some other stuff there
and I got these amazing see-through
floral palmtree black and white pants
they're from Flint sky I wear size extra
small they are so beautiful I'm planning
on just wearing a black bikini bottom
under them because I'm leave for Cancun
at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning and I could
not be more excited so that is probably
where most of these clothes it's going
to be worn on my body is on spring break
but be the beautiful I love as well at
that sample sale I got this it was only
15 bucks as a maybe it's my style maybe
it's not maybe I'm trying something new
so it's tight at the bottom and it's
kind of just flowy on the top with these
big square armpit holes I think this is
so flattering plus I love when clothing
is
their linen or God material so this is
so beyond comfortable this was actually
originally a skirt which I bet it could
still be a sick skirt I decided to wear
it as a dress it fits me as a tube dress
and it looks so flattering also kind of
pushed up your boobs a little bit since
the material is so thick right here I
hope you guys can tell but it's really
3d and kind of with a popcorn ceiling
material but still really soft and this
is super flowy and has printed V design
going on the next thing I got this is
the brand Jen spires movies you're
wondering they all are made of the same
materials like this GOG material so this
one has an amazing cowl neck and you can
wear this off the shoulder or just
really bagged up around the neck like a
scarf and it's just flowy long-sleeve
this is gonna look amazing on the beach
with the kini bottoms or something like
that I really don't know how to style it
yet oh but it's so beautiful these are
from Jen spires we as well I got one in
black and then I got one in white
they're both in a size extra small
they're kind of old western meets beachy
style this is similar to a silky satin
finish kind of like a prom dress I don't
know what mature with is chiffon is
chiffon material honestly I don't know
but it has amazing frills on the front
and be back but the white one is so
beyond stunning look at this I can't
wait to just wear highway to their
shorts and bikini top and then this kind
of just hanging out not buttoned up
completely
okay I'm going way too into detail but
you guys get the point these are some
fun flowy beachy shorts and they come
with two strings you can just tie them
however you desire I love a flowy gauzy
linen type clothing I think it's so
beachy and it's perfect just throw on in
the summer pending on if you live
somewhere be cheese or not wear whatever
you want in the summer I also went to
Urban Outfitters men's section because
urban up
was having a sale you'd really aren't
for me but I bought this been putting
them in the hall I bought them for my
boyfriend Hayden this is a stuffy
sweatshirt or sissy
I love sissy I got him in size medium
because that's what he wears I don't
know should I give this to him or should
I keep it I love this yellow color just
looks like that and then I also got him
another one he's really been into
wearing cool colors lately so I got him
this really Brown green color religious
with a yellow with an essence of sissy
as well
oh my love it the size medium as well so
we have to include some jewelry in this
haul I got these from fonts are they did
send me them and I am absolutely in love
I just got these in the mail today
they're so beautiful I'm going to be
putting them in my Coachella lookbook
that I'm filming really soon
but their packaging is also so exquisite
so here is what the first piece looks
like it is choker and it has a bunch of
gorgeous crosses as you eye can see so
delicate and pretty perfect for layering
which I love layering necklaces so if
you're wondering where this is from its
from wheelie glass and then this is one
of their most well known chokers I think
on their Instagram if you follow up on
star so this one's really cool because
you can totally just layer it a bunch of
different ways around your neck and wear
it however really your heart desires
which I love stuff that is versatile I
don't really buy and you can add just a
one purpose use so this is so beautiful
I was their choice Ygritte is it weird
if I show you guys my underwear okay I
don't really care but I want to show you
guys this underwear because they are the
comfiest underwear on the planet earth
do you need to go buy them so my
Victoria's Secret I buy their seamless
underwear that look like this that are
super stretchy and they are so
comfortable so here's all the colors I
got TMI I know I got some cheeky and
then some hipster ones prove I love to
wear hipster wants to bed I don't really
like to ourselves event I think it's so
uncomfortable who this red pair is so
cute how cute and these
even though they aren't super Lacy and
stuff they are they look so flattering
on
I hope about this Paris a little bit
more fun if you know what I mean it's
super beautiful and this material is so
comfortable and then I made a stop over
at Sephora and I spent money that I
shouldn't have but I got this amazing
Natasha and ona palette so if you guys
follow Breanna joy she did Sephora haul
and I saw this in her haul on my smooth
double pigmented as hell I need them so
I went Sephora and I was checking out
these pallets and they are expensive I
have never seen something so creamy and
glowy my entire life it's the eyeshadow
I have on my eyes actually today I used
this color and then this color in the
corner oh my gosh is these are all so
beautiful this is the piece for palette
this is the ambient lighting powder from
hourglass in the shade in light this is
a holy grail in my makeup collection I
can't live without this product no
longer I have no bronzer or contour
shade on I'm strictly only wearing this
on my face today I used to have the
trowel size but I decided to invest in
the larger size and the packaging is
actually to die for so that does it for
that looks like you guys can see how
pale this is next to my skin but it
makes the most beautiful shadows on my
face which I'm uploading the tutorial
soon or it already is up on my channel
where I use this as contour and you guys
can just see how stunning it looks and
then I was watching
Olivia Jade on YouTube oh my gosh she is
the cutest human but she was doing a
sponsored post with Clinique and I
bought the foundation that she was using
just because it looked so doing in
hydrating so it's the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer it
looks like this and I was just bored I
want to try a new foundation plus I
think I just bought this because of the
applicator you just put it on your face
like that which I think it's so I
feeling I wear the shade breathe but
yeah so thanks to her for showing me
this product then you guys so are taking
time to watch this video I hope you
love everything I love reading your
comments down below so please let's hang
out let's talk oh that reminds me
I'm supposed to be eating dinner while
filling this but now I'm eating dinner
so I guess I'm eating a classic Greek
salad there's only four bucks from
Trader Joe's I'm sorry
such as feel know that you're all
beautiful and I hope you're all staying
healthy
