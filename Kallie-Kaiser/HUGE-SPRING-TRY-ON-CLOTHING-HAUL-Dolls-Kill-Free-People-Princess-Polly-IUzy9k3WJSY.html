have to work later all right
hey guys it's Kat and for today's video
we are doing another clothing haul I'm
insane I don't know how I have another
haul to show you guys what a lot of
stuff is definitely spring oriented so
hopefully that will be enjoyable because
spring break is coming up and of stuff
like and ask if you guys want follow my
instagram is that Kelly Kaiser but I'd
love to you in this video
everything will be tried on link down
below in the description box and here we
go
to kick off the haul I'm going to show
you guys some stuff I received from an
amazing cool online
Audrey boutique called princess Polly if
you haven't heard of princess Polly
before I'll link all this stuff down
below in the description box but I have
included them in my hold in the past and
you guys have seem to love the stuff
just as much as I have
so the first thing I'm showing you guys
is this amazing black lace bodysuit I
got mine in a size 6 which I believe is
an extra small how gorgeous is this
piece it's all black mesh in the back
and it is wire underlines obviously
there's no additional padding to make
your boobs push up it has really
beautiful lace all the way on the front
that see-through I have been working
this way too much I post this on the
Instagram as well also you watching at
20% off with princess Polly to use the
code
Kali's just my name and if you spend
over $70 you get free shipping so super
excited
this is probably my new favorite piece
honest message that you need it and then
the next thing I want to show you guys
is this super adorable crop top look how
amazing the light texture is the sequins
in this I got - size 8 which is a small
I believe it just has a simple zipper in
the back just black and silver this is
exactly how it looks on - it's just
really flattering what's amazing with
black high-waisted jeans must-have I got
this in an extra small as well and I
really wish I got this in black too but
it's just a super beautiful white crop
with a little tie in the front
um I wear this paired with the bodysuit
underneath it is such a look it looks
amazing I'll show you guys in the trying
portion what this looks like together
but it's one of my new favorite things
and I've been wearing a lot lately and
you guys can probably do it with anybody
C or any weight crops that you have so I
got this in a size extra smoke well it's
rib material super comfy looks really
good with high waisted anything I have
wanted to dress at this for so long it's
so flattering people look at it amazing
love the coloring it's really tight on
the body so it looks really good I think
you'd be really cool if you kind of
grunge it up a little bit with jewelry
and maybe a leather jacket on top you
can even wear this with fishnets I love
mixing textures Bruce so since this is
one of the most beautiful pieces I now
have in my closet it's kind of like a
rose gold Sheen to it and I'm trying to
hold it up it kind of looks like
chainmail if that makes sense so chains
I made out of it but it's not it's a
knit material super beautiful and
metallic looking and has few slits on
the side that make your legs look really
longer if you're shorter like me
princess falling is really great
Coachella pieces if you're trying to
find anything to wear Coachella I might
want to make this a look I don't have to
find when I'd wear underneath it but
this is honestly just so beautiful and
then I also just picked out a super cozy
t-shirt this is a regular t-shirt I got
my nice size 10 because I want it to be
a little bit bad year by a lot when
people tie it right underneath their
boobs and it looks really good with high
waisted pants and I like anything that
looks vintage
so the outlining of the sleeves and the
collar looks really cool to me and then
I picked up this really nice bro tank
dress just because the sleeves are cut
off I got this other side actually small
so comfortable set t-shirt caught me to
really great and then I love this rustic
warm red would you hold this maroon
I don't think stuff but it's just the
Athens brand I could be pronouncing that
wrong but you guys always cracked me in
the comments so thank you so much they
have something really great genom on
their websites of course I had to pick
out some jeans as well I got - a small
which is a size 8
look at these bottoms how unreal I have
wanted bottoms like this for so long but
never been able to find me perfect
pair of jeans so now I own them you guys
know how obsessed I am with stars so I
picked up this white and magic t-shirt
super lightweight breathable material I
love it i got mine inside small which is
a size 8 on their website and then it
just has these black star sequined
package dogon which is just adorable
love love love love love love love i was
obnoxious
sorry a lot of you know i love clothes
that just stand now obviously I needed
to see mister eye on this I got the
suicide extra small and it's just so fun
it has more of a denim or purple
material and it kind of blue with these
metallic red and yellow shiny stars all
over it it dips down in the front kind
of look at handkerchiefs would if you
would wear it as a tube top which you
should definitely do I love wearing
tinker chips just two tops with jeans
princess Paulette also has some bomb-ass
shoes i have wanted patent leather boots
for the longest time i kid you not
so i don't - i sticks they are very true
size they fit me amazing how amazing are
these I have been working some way too
much you can policy they're a little bit
dirty from the club but obsessed I also
really want red patent leather boots if
anyone knows where I could get some
really cool red patent leather boots let
me know down below because I'm dying for
a pair I'm just so upset and since the
last thing from princess Holly you guys
can get 20% off if you use the code
Callie and I'll have everything linked
down below description box as well I was
able to go to the Reformation sample
sale anyone who hasn't heard of
Reformation for it so since this time I
actually don't own anything from them
until now so they sent out an email to
all their subscribers who's ever
subscribed to their email list and I got
this I think it was around $20 which is
$20 for fish size of fabric but I have
already on the money out of everyone and
five or six times by now it's just a
amazing Croft rib little spaghetti strap
tank top I not - eyes small I don't know
if they're having on their website
because they do I would get one because
I will
so much and the color is absolutely
stunning this is my favorite thing that
I got the Reformation since oh it's not
buttoned but I'm sure you always get the
idea so it's entirely backless so you
put it on like this and the entire back
shows which I just think is so so chic
and exquisite this is an amazing color
as well I don't really own anything
coral or salmon color is this red or
orange I feel like you have that
constant fight on Twitter with pictures
leather orange all the time and then it
has a little bit of an inch or two inch
difference at the bottom as a high-low
and then it just buttons up all the way
because if the back looks like this is
just so flattering I got this in a
double-0
if I can hold this up for you guys yes
it just looks like that so beautiful the
next thing I picked up from them is this
amazing stretch blue and white linen
romper that goes all the way down
probably about to my ankles I definitely
need to steam this or iron it because I
wore it to brunch the other day and it's
a little baggy now and the sleeves are
the best part they just tie and they
hang out right here I actually wore this
in my last haul and a lot of you guys
asked for it from it's actually a robber
and it looks like this it's just
strapless super girly perfect for spring
I just want to go on to a picnic with it
maybe and the last thing I picked up
from Reformation was just a simple black
button up linen romper it's spaghetti
straps
I think spaghetti straps with the best
if you ask me this is a double zero as
well just looks like this and has
pockets on the side so really plain
black romper super comfy just perfect to
throw on to class or launcher if you
want to go get food anywhere so this
haul would not be complete without some
dolls kill so I got this fake antisocial
crewneck long-sleeve Adele Carroll
softest material ever oh my goodness I
got - I can you know it already comes
oversized so I guess I should have
gotten a size small love it it looks
really great because the gross pass
across you can wear really cool pants
with it which brings me to my next thing
how bomb are these leggings they tie up
all the way along the way
Ohan if you guys have been asking where
I got these so finally I'm putting them
in my haul for you how fun it's amazing
if you wear an oversized sweatshirt with
them as well which I do way too often
I got minor size extra small they're the
Dolph kill currently brand current mood
is Dolph kill this with their branded
these are so comfortable to the faux
leather look can't say enough about them
I picked up a bikini I wanted to share
everything in this video just to tell
you guys I have my spring breaking video
coming up and attend right so keep an
eye out for that because I'm going to be
showing you guys my absolute favorite
the best bikinis to bring up spring
break so the first bikini that I'm going
to show you guys that I purchased is
from our Eli's and what a great brand
I definitely saved up to buy this bikini
because it is not cheap it is this towel
material but it's really do G and nice
that makes sense I don't want to send
extra small I know it looks like this
won't cover anything but it's so
flattering on the body so this is just
what the top looks like I got - extra
small pendants in it already and the
bottoms are life they are high waisted
with a cheeky bomb and they stretch of
it too so if you're worried about that
so beautiful Topshop was having a really
good sale so I got a beanie with a
little pom-pom on the top I think it's a
stock hold on it I love beanies I linen
beanies I think the color yellow is so
in this season so anything that I've
been seeing yellow I've just been like
honey I need it it's been starting a
warm up a bit in California so I picked
up some 1 teaspoon denim shorts I got
these each for 50 bucks they were half
off around New Year's I believe so I got
mine in size 22 they do run two dozen
smaller than your normal size and I
don't know if once these are I can't
remember but they fit with this super
fun just plain denim shorts and then I
also got another pair of plain dinner
shorts these ones are the blue mult
bloom all bandits bandage are the best
if you do want to invest in a pair of
1tsp I got these in size 22 as well here
so you guys can see the color difference
between them there's not a big
difference
but I just really so often that I really
wanted to different color I got this
jacket at Urban Outfitters I probably
won't be needing this jacket in the
spring but I wanted to bring it off to
California in case you got cold at night
but the color is so springy and fun I
tried to sign the other day with
high-waisted pants and a white little
crop top from H&amp;amp;M and olmeyer this looks
so good peril on top of it
so retro is fun so I just thought I
should share this I got mine in size
medium at Urban Outfitters as well I
just got one of these basic silk
long-sleeve tie front tops just for fun
- we're all blessed underneath and stuff
I think these are so beautiful really
flattering I got - this extra small and
it fits perfect our binoculars as well I
got another pair of high-waisted denim
jeans I don't know which ones these are
I think there's a beauty G mom or the
girlfriend jeans I don't remember but
they just look like this at the bottom I
roll them because they're not super
flattering and skinny at the bottom but
they look really great on the bum and
they're really flattering because
they're so high waisted and I just
really love a good pair of denim jeans I
thrifted this polo windbreaker asbestos
is a lubricant I could be wrong about
this goodwill I love a like sick sauce
where my best friends found it she
didn't end up buying it and like can I
get back we so I said I loved the color
blocking of the light blue the navy blue
and it just is so comfy and it's perfect
to throw on over crop tops or anything
it's really springy I think this will
look really great um on the beach with a
bikini maybe for a photo shoot I don't
know how my mind works I got this sick
bomber from subdued I love subdued so
this is panel obviously you guys know I
had a camo obsession about two months
ago I got the suicide medium love this
it's so flattering on and it's just a
great camel color because it's dark and
it's not super bright you can mix this
with a lot of different colors I think
at three people I love free people sale
section I got this necklace it's such
blocks on it I don't know why I was so
drawn to this but light tank and really
cool yellow pastel colors are super in
this season but I thought this choker
would look really cool layered with
silver necklaces
and it doesn't are anything and photos
in this and I love it and I also got
this necklace from brandy melville I
have one this was so long it was out of
stock and summer some of them happy they
restocked it it's just silver chain with
silver starting off of it you guys can
just be so cheap it was really good with
this whenever is are at sales they have
such great sales I got these for under
20 bucks and there's a really nice
silver metallic chrome color I like
anything that's really space light or
different so you guys can just see I do
wish they were more pointed to though
all my boots that I recently purchased
in the past have always had almost two
inches heel or maybe three inches of a
feel from the shoes I showed you
previously so far I really wanted to get
a more flattening and this is some warm
of western style which I don't really go
for that's fine so long and it looks as
flattering on me these are cheetah
I love cheetah they're from free people
they're amazing I got mine in size
six-and-a-half and knees I believe
they've run narrow but I already out
really narrow feet so they run true to
size for my foot you guys can just see
how adorable these are and might wear
them to Coachella with a look I don't
know yet I'm still trying to find
Coachella office but I'm still doing a
hotel lookbook for you guys as well the
other day when I went to go check my
mail public desire had sent me some
shoes so I can't wait to show you guys
these um you're going to die
there are full-on snakeskin booties
unreal I get my next size four which is
a woman stick on their website I just
love how much desire so much there's
this is a nice company they also sent me
this really notebook and planner with my
shoes so I now write down my schedule in
this for school and stuff and these are
just absolutely stunning and they're a
looser leather fabric at the top so if
you're wearing some jeans they won't be
as tight oh they look so good the next
pair is just being amazing of black
booties with a pointed toe I like how
there is two different blacks that this
is more of a suede design and then this
is just
normal shoe plasticy feelings but these
don't really expenses both of these feel
really expensive obviously a link these
folks down the 50 box that upset I love
you public desire I believe I'm
everything for today's video so I hope
