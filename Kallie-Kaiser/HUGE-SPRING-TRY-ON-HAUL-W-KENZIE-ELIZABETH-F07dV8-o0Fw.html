are filming a spring shrine hall
we're collabing this video so this is
part two if you missed part one you need
to go to NZ lens this channel and watch
our haul and there we tried everything
on and as you guys can find all the
links down below in her description box
but for this video we're trying on
everything as well I'm so happy to have
this baby with me and so without further
ado we left in this video if you want to
follow us on our Instagram mine is at
Cal Kaiser's and where is my Nana
Lindsay Lisbeth so so bomb here we go
zooming gasser is first oh thanks so
much
okay it's the first shooting they have
art Hawk screeches well the first two
things are hot or some susan and both
just like black 1000 so this one is cool
because of feedback is open of course
and then it has a zipper so that's
really bad it's not you know and then
this one it just says like Rosa all day
the whole I feel like I've seen designs
from other times I like this point it's
not as flattering as most I will say
just because I like it when it's cut up
hired and not my favorite but I still
like it
so and I think my legs look long yeah I
like those no my soldering so I have a
one piece as well this one is from loose
I love it the sides are all cut out
really - and it has a really high cut -
so if you don't like cheesy bums this is
a real cheeky and I love the v-neck
because it shows a lot of cleavage and
it's rib material so since it's white it
won't be see-through this material so
thick I feel way to wear this on spring
break and going to Cancun
I'm going to came here in July no way
yeah oh I'm ready okay and all that
colors me I know it's not amazing okay
this is lucky - yep I forgot to miss a
nice I want this one okay so this is
fraud love you clothing they're amazing

the other day have you gone back on
since boohoo read it is oh it through
bottom yeah do they bought them for
twenty million dollars and then they
read his website if you go on

anything but I saw this dress and I was
like I need this dress pretty so it is
super relieved I just love how
flattering it is it's the brand endless
rows or MS rose' depending on how you
want to read it it ties up on your
shoulders which I love and it kind of
gives a little sb2 which is of course
