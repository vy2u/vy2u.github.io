my Instagram is Holly Heiser so that for
Thursday here we go okay start off the
haul the first place I have to share
with you guys are from princess Polly
which is probably the coolest Australian
fashion boutique I love love love their
clothing I probably include them in way
to any of my halls but that's just how
much I love them and I do have a
discount code that you guys can use the
code is princess Callie for 25% off
their entire website so the first thing
that I want to show you guys that I'm
literally obsessed with is just this
gorgeous below ribs bodysuit this looks
amazing with denim it kind of has that
bustier design a lot of companies are
coming out with and styling their
clothes with it's just the most
beautiful loo I honestly honestly don't
own one thing in my closet of this
colors I now own a future clothing
that's orange I got this one size 8
which is a size small I love this the
sleeves are what makes this so
flattering because they're not too flowy
but they're not too close to the skin
that makes it a really sleek modern look
and it's just a type front blouse which
I love I own still a tie front blouses
and I like that you can tie it in
multiple ways to make it even more
versatile than it already is I think
this is probably the most fun thing I
now own how adorable is this dress it's
pink and white plaid or checkers I don't
know whatever you want to call this I
got - size extra small which is a size 6
on their website and all of their
clothes will be linked down below the
description box for you guys wow I love
this so beautiful I can't wait to wear I
got all white ideas which are later on
in the top I'll show you guys and I
think they look so cute and I wear these
socks with them so they kind of like
peek up a little bit I also got this
amazing denim jack
it how amazing I love them I love this
super comfortable I got mine in a size
small medium and I've already worn stops
today and actually got some compliments
on it too this is also where my favorite
things I got because I think it looks so
vintage and cool oh my gosh I love this
I don't know how to describe this
pattern just like florals flowers and
this is a really soft bob it's also tied
front kind of look going on and this
looks great as denim or anything I would
fit honestly this top is fancy it is all
black and is kind of that bandage type
you guys will know what I'm talking
about when I try this on I got this in a
size 8 I believe yes which is a size
small
it's perfectly I love how cool the
neckline is you'll see it again when I
try it on and I also got these amazing
where are they they're these amazing
pants these the cognac are in between
like business and super high-end fashion
which I love I got these in size extra
small but I love two-piece set they
obviously are not from the same brand or
anything but they definitely go together
they're both on princess Polly I'll link
it down below and I love these are so
funny they're so high waisted and they
make the bum look really good I also got
a really fun going out dressed it ties
in the front and kind of has a peekaboo
spot in between where your belly button
would end or start I guess and kind of
underneath your boobs which I love so
flattering I got this in a size extra
small and it just looks like tit I
already know I'm going to be wearing
this top every single day because I own
a top like this in black from Urban
Outfitters but how amazing is this just
it's a plain white little crop top
I'm obsessed I've already worn it a few
times and you'll be seeing this a lot on
my Instagram honestly
and then from princess Polly as well I
also got another amazing tie front top
this one is all black and I did get this
in a size extra small so it just looks
like this it's just a really nice blouse
I probably need to steam it right now
but
it was amazing with the really long
pants as well you guys will see in the
Tryon portion it's really hard to hold
this up on camera for you guys this is
an extra small this is from princess
Polly as well it just is all white it's
an amazing linen material with these
black stripes this looks so nice and
casual for brunch or breakfast or
honestly should just throw our bikini
I love how flowy this is and you know
the different levels at the bottom as
you guys can see it's about a three inch
difference I also got this amazing star
ear cuff you just wear it like this and
it kind of just trails all the way up
your ear it's from princess Polly as
well I love this I love jewelry
I think jewelry makes every look and so
I'm really excited to wear this since
this is a Somerville I had to include a
swimsuit so triangle silver has been
releasing swimsuits literally left and
right oh my goodness so I just had to
share the neoprene bags they came in
they used to be Josh strings but I've
definitely updated and this is way
better I love this this is just like a
huge makeup bag to me but I got the
yellow velvet shoe in the strappy design
how adorable are these bottoms they're a
little bit cheeky size small for the
bottoms and I got a size small for the
top as well the top dress oh my gosh the
top for sure runs small so I would
definitely size up but I just looked
like this I love this I can't wait to
wear it Wratten boa came out with a
summer collection which is just the
greatest thing ever so I got this
absolutely stunning gorgeous it's kind
of a silky velvet chiffon material dress
it's such a beautiful lavender color I
love it you can tie in the back or the
front and this is what the sleeves look
like nothing like I own and it's a cowl
neck in the front and back I got this in
a size extra small it's already sold out
on their website you can't buy this
anymore but I'll still link it down
below so you guys can check it out it's
just so beautiful
at Urban Outfitters I got this really
super plain black cami top I've been
living this I wear this underneath
everything I just haven't been wearing a
bra just been wearing this bra light it
is so comfortable I got mine in size
small
I'll have the link down below this past
weekend was the
for love and lemon sample fit with May 6
and Brianna white and I went together so
if you have a little fun shopping day it
was actually so hectic but we found such
good stuff that was so worth it
so the first dress that I ended up
getting this is size extra small I got
this one and has amazing embroidery all
over it soaks with it this is such an
expensive dress so there's no way I can
afford this without the sample sale so
I'm really happy I was able to get my
hands on this one I'm not obsessed with
this design but since it was so on sale
I had to get it I love it still really
girly and fun I'll definitely be wearing
this a lot of my sister's friends are
graduating so maybe I can wear this to
one of her friends grad parties or
something this is probably my favorite
thing I got in a sample sale just
because I've had my eyes on it for so
long how amazing it is also that bustier
design and then the sleeves are
completely see-through and or know if
you guys can see that but just has roses
embroidery all over it I did get this in
a size small as well here's what the
back looks like I didn't see a lot of
people walking around with this dress in
the sample sale I think it was probably
one of the only ones at the sale or just
went by really fast but just this
amazing gorgeous peach color I love this
the white embroidery so beautiful this
is such an expensive dress and I was
able to only get it for 50 bucks which
is such such a steal I definitely have
to get this taken in a little bit right
here everyone's asking where I layer all
of these little gold earrings I don't
have but I have a behind these those are
from Free People
I own the pack in the silver and in gold
I highly recommend buying these or so
many thing I'll have them linked down
below and a lot of the gold leather
patches are missing the earrings I
currently have them in my ear but yeah
there's some horns I love this dangly
cross one the silver pack is unreal
because it's like little black horns and
this is really pretty
I don't also say about seeing I wear
them all the time I layer a bunch of
earrings I have two piercings on this
year and then five on this year so it's
just really great for layering it looks
so good the necklaces on three people I
also got
pair of shoes which I'm absolutely in
love with how dope are these they remind
me of 70s I might not have the right era
but if I don't who cares
and they velcro when they wrap around
the foot or the ankle right here they're
just silver and ye they're so blocky and
fun so comfortable I got minus i6 and
they're a little bit big around my foot
area just because I have a really narrow
foot but there's nothing I can do about
it I love them this is what they both
look like together I can't wait to wear
these I hope I wear them all the time in
the summer after people I also got these
amazing sunglasses they're just huge
square blocks on my face but what's
really nice is I love to people watch
them no one can see me when I wear these
it just makes a really casual outfit
super chic which I love that and then I
have some jewelry to share with you guys
from the brand west coast
I believe Sarah is her name that owns a
company oh my gosh she's so amazing
kindest person ever I love her and I'll
leave a link down below for the
Instagram and where you can find this
online as well so the first thing that I
have to show is this amazing black
choker I'm still obsessed with stars I
love stars so much so you can just layer
this as a bunch of cool necklaces and
it's just a choker with a star attached
I loved so we have this really gorgeous
fun choker with all of these amazing
circles hanging from it as you guys can
see it's kind of similar to this design
where stuff just and those from that
which i think is so I should be wearing
this right now instead this would look
really great layered Reformation is
probably one of my favorite brands I
don't own a lot of stuff from them
because their clothes are super
expensive but their t-shirts are not
very expensive at all so I got one of
their t-shirts I had no idea how
comfortable these were Wow
I just got this amazing light pink kind
of ribbed material
t-shirt it doesn't say what size it is
but I do love the look wherever just
makes a tie in the middle kinda wear
zone high-waisted denim so that's
probably what I'll end up doing with
this I also have been wearing this a lot
I recently just washed it so you can't
tell but I usually tie it in the middle
right here it's from the brand redone I
don't know if any of you guys are
with them but I'll have a link down
below they usually just sell all amazing
denim and jeans it's so nice but this is
so vintage and cool I love wearing this
you can also get 15% off their website I
believe I'll insert the code down below
inscription ma forever I linked this so
I went on Bald Hill and I picked up some
more stuff just if you've watched any of
my other haul you know how much I love
dog kill so I got this pretty out-there
Kroft jacket and thought this is great
for summer night I'm going back to
Chicago for the summer and I got minor
size extra small I believe I love this I
love flannel plaid looking clothing I
just think it's really nice and it's
silver hardware all over it some of the
only denim jean shorts I wear are one
teaspoon and I saw these on don't kill
how sick are these there's this awesome
stitch right on the butt so cute it is
roll up completely these are probably
really short for some people um but I
kind of just wear oversized sweatshirts
and t-shirts anyway so kind of just
covers my but nothing really shows I got
the synthesised extra extra small and
the fringe the leather fringe on the
side is following my favorite thing then
there's also a suede patch right here I
have had my eyes on this civil regime
sweatshirt for the longest time I think
it looks so badass and the only thing I
don't like is this patch right here but
I love the flannel patch on the front
this is so comfortable it was really
expensive and I was able to get it on
sale and I guess I just got in too small
oh my gosh I actually cannot talk today
this is so fun it's just a yellow mesh
cropped little quarter length little
cropped off I don't know how to say this
it's really great you can layer any bra
underneath this or kind of pair a weird
outfit I'll show you guys how I style it
but you can definitely style it any way
you want
I remember what size I got this in but
so fun I then not that super plain
orange t-shirt just as perspectives on I
got this in a size small
I really want to cut it and crop it
right underneath like under boob I think
it would look so cool with high-waisted
jeans so I'm going to pronounce this
right this is stu see to see the bridge
literally people rip me to shreds in the
comments for pronouncing this
I got this amazing white juicy t-shirt I
love it it's a men's medium it is a
bright yellow perfect for summer I also
got a white juicy t-shirt I love this
because the juicy logo has sparkles on
it and it's in pink not saying that I'm
obsessed in the color pink but it's
sparkly I love this at PacSun I got this
really cool shirt just as Kors on it the
beer it is a collaboration with Brixton
and Korres which how cool is this
t-shirt I love it and I love beer
something else I have been wearing every
single day is this just plain amazing
block little boob tube top I love this I
got this in size 8 I have never shot
some pretty little thing before but wow
they have amazing purses so I'm so happy
I own this and I wear it all the time I
need to go back and buy in white I never
thought I would love a sweat suit so
much my entire life so this is the
sweatshirt part of it is from weekend
vice literally such an amazing brand I
love them I'll link their Instagram and
their website down below description box
so this is an amazing I don't know
exactly what pattern difficult it's
definitely not waffle material but
sweatshirt cents off and I love how it
cinches around the waist I've been
carrying this with me everyday to school
and it comes with matching joggers which
are just such a dream I wear a size
small medium for the top and the
sweatshirt and an extra small small on
the bottoms how unreal are these jogging
so are these joggers they're just so
sick and comfortable they fit me really
really well I've never had a pair of
pants fit me this well honestly and then
I also have that same set in this army
green color which I love I haven't worn
the top army green and you guys can see
the tassel on it but I've worn the
geographer jeans of this sweatshirt and
I literally just live in this sweat
pants sweat suit to school so these
really big comparing and all of these
layered necklaces that I have on right
now are from the brand ru ege and Bo n I
don't know how to pronounce it but oh my
gosh they come in the most beautiful
bags
like this there white leather and this
is what the logo looks like so pretty
it's definitely like arou James Bond
roo-roo jem fun I don't know I hate when
I pronounce names wrong but how gorges
are these gold earrings and not shocked
at brandy melville and so long by when
the story the other day of my best
friends and I got we both ended up
getting this yellow top I love this it's
one size fits all I just decided to tie
it underneath my students right here and
it's totally long enough to wear the
crop and tie it like this it's totally
appropriate I love it so pretty and I
also got the same color waffle design
but I got it in a cropped
long-sleeve waffle tea instead just
because I don't look good at all for
school I literally throw on leggings and
a sweatshirt every day so this is
perfect to just wear underneath a
sweatshirt for an extra layer of warmth
I have been hearing everyone raised
about a low legging so I finally picked
myself up a pair where's the front
here's the front this is what they look
like I decided to get the ones with the
rips in it I know why would I pay for
launching this with rips in it but these
are honestly so chic I love it I wear
with an oversized sweatshirt I don't
really work out anymore but I'm
definitely trying to get back into it so
buy what you wear definitely helps
motivate while we're working on so I'm
happy to own these cute leggings now for
size six and a half or a four and a half
into kids unisex adidas classics so if
you could do that it will save you $20
or 25 bucks you are welcome but if not
you're gonna have to order from some men
or women section um but these are them
they're amazing
I got an all-white I used to own all
white Adidas with the black stripes but
I'm just so sick of them and everyone
kind of owns them so and I just can
never find anything else to wear with
them anymore that makes sense so I mess
it in these and I can't live without
them thank you guys so much for taking
