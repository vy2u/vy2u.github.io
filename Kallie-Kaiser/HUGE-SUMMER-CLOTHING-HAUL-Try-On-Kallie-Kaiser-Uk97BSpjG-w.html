have another summer clothing haul to
share with you guys literally this might
be my biggest haul in ever put on my
youtube channel so go grab a snack and
sit with me because it might be longer
than I think I'm really excited to show
you guys what I got if you want to
follow me on my Instagram and it's just
at Kelly Keizer or you could subscribe
to my youtube channel by clicking that
button down below but without further
ado I love to get in this video so here
we go to start up the haul and show you
guys some amazing stuff that I have from
the brand adore me okay I'm going to
start off with disco Jamison because I'm
so obsessed with it I already have slept
in it twice it is so comfortable they
look like this I got my own size extra
small and adore me has sizes where we
from
petite to plus it doesn't matter they
will have your size so here's what the
bottoms look like they do not go all the
way down my ankles they're kind of a
cropped look so it's perfect for summer
pajamas and then here's what the top
looks like these two together look
incredible you guys will see how cute
and cozy it is in the Tryon Park and a
pajama set that I have is absolutely
amazing these are just that gorgeous
classic black with the white outlining
and these buttons I love this they come
with matching bottoms as well they look
like this oh and the bottoms have the
white lining on it I love these and then
got this gorgeous bra and panty set and
what's really nice is adore me is
actually offering you guys your first
set for 2495 without committing to a
monthly subscription which is amazing
and they also offer free returns and
exchanges some no worries and they also
have new collections every month so I
love this bra it's just super lazy and
fun I no longer wear push-up bras and
this is what I literally wear every day
these are perfect for me they're just
underwire and then here's what the
undies look like that come with it you
can choose a clean thumb or hipster I
was so obsessed with it I got it in
black too so here's what the black bra
looks like and it's just so gorgeous so
so so beautiful
this is what the bottoms look like I
love lacy stuff I think it's so elegant
or just feel cooler when I wear lace I
don't know why I also got this really
cute bra letsa this is just a gorgeous
light blue shade so pretty and it comes
with these matching underwear
I love hipsters or cheeky underwear so
nice something about it when you put a
bathrobe on after you shower and then
you tie your hair up in the towel it's
probably my favorite thing when you walk
around the house for way too long
so I got this amazing bathrobe it has a
gorgeous light pink silk tie and it's
all black it is long-sleeve and it goes
to my knees you guys will see in the
Tryon portion but this is a super
stretchy comfortable material Wow
so I got these amazing black tie joggers
I love them I really live in sweat so
I'm obsessed with these and then I also
got this amazing black t-shirt I'm fully
gonna workout in this it has black mesh
sleeves which I love because I'm
obsessed with fishnet or anything that's
much this is such a fun workout set I
love the colors it's just a pink and
gray and black and send or me on the
butt or right above the butt which I
like here's what the leggings look like
they have mesh all up and down the leg
which is so nice I love the way that
looks
and then here's what the matching sports
bra looks like it has that mesh all
across your chest or above your chest I
should say and then here's what the back
looks like it's kind of strappy and cute
so of course I had to get this black
strappy bikini it's hard to hold up on
camera for you guys but you guys will
see in the trying portion and I got - a
small and a sole for the bottom as well
these are cute because they are strappy
as well and they aren't too cheeky which
I love so but they're not full coverage
they're flattering on the bone this is
probably my favorite things that I
purchased this summer I'm absolutely
obsessed it is with this gorgeous yellow
denim skirt it's from Topshop but I
bought it on sale at Nordstrom so I will
for sure have this feeling down
whoa and I got mine in the sights - this
is on sale - it's a matching denim
jacket - that denim skirt how incredible
is this I got this in a size six and
just leave their cuffs I also love how
they have these leather patches that are
white just embroidered that say Topshop
on the jacket I am obsessed with yellow
if you can't tell I picked up a few
basics from the store or Ischia because
they were having a really good sale and
I probably would never pay full price
for some of these items so this is the
cutest most comfortable over the hair
chest to it this is super flattering on
my bodies what I'm trying to say I got
it in white and in black they were both
on sale I bet their sales still going on
I could be wrong though I love that I
love the v-neck and then the entire back
is covered and then I also got these
really cute comfy sweatpants in white
and they just have a seam going down the
whole leg so it kind of makes me look a
little bit taller to the m-53 um I love
wearing the white sweatpants with the
white top that I got I'm obsessed
these are really cool they're kind of my
Kim Possible pants a lot of people own
me in camo pattern I just got playing
back ones playing black ones they have
pockets all up and down the legs they're
kind of just black cargo pants I got
mine from Arista and these are size
extra small and the brand is community
this may be the most comfortable shirt I
own so are you Am I
yes it is a little bit pricey but I'm
absolutely obsessed with their basic
tops because no one else sells a top
like this if you've ever seen a top this
style because I haven't so I'm obsessed
it's a size small it's long sleeve
cropped that rib design if everything I
could want in the top this is from the
brand are you oh my as well it's just
this really cute kind of nudie blush
pink color
- a small it's just that iconic across
the shoulders short sleeve top and it's
ribs so you know it's so stretchy
high-waisted sweatpants are the new
thing it's such a vibe so these are the
new investment I purchase how incredible
how incredible I know
you're speechless so these are chrome
Danielle judo we though I don't know how
to pronounce her name but she's a
designer in New York and her clothes are
off the rack bomb I've never heard
anyone say that but this is besides
extra small they have red checkers that
checker design all down the leg they're
so comfortable and then here is the
matching zip up Hoodie that's cross
incredible these two bra Lex are
probably my favorite but less that I now
own over any row left that I have I just
think they are so cool they are so on
point with trends right now so I got it
in white and black they're from the
brand the end lingerie how cool is it so
it has this horn right in the middle and
what's really cool is you can actually
remove this if you're not vibing with it
for the day but personally I like to
keep mine on you just unscrew one of the
sides and it comes right out but I live
for this design I just love the silver
horn so if you're wearing a black mesh
shirt you can just wear this underneath
and it shows through and you look really
cool so you can also get 20% off of the
end lingerie which is this brand and
this is their certainly harder
collection and you can get 20% off with
the CAO 20 code so I'll put it on the
screen right here so you guys have it to
talk about some swimsuits I also picked
up a swimsuit from Danielle doozy oh we
though I don't know pronounce it so here
at the bottom you can kind of wear them
high above your hips or low rise
whatever you're feeling this is the
comfiest swimsuit material I've ever put
on in my entire life and then the top is
actually head sleeves and it's kind of
that tie front design I also got a new
triangle bikini it is yellow of course
this is so gorgeous right when they came
out with this design I just had to have
my hands on it so I got the top in size
small and it's just a straight across
tube top there's no way to adjust it and
this actually fits me perfect
I wish another size extra small in the
bottoms they're a little baggy on me or
just afraid that wants to get wet it'll
be a little bit baggy but otherwise in
the trying portion you guys will see
that they fit me perfect okay these are
my favorite shorts I live
ever owned in my entire life they are
the redone denim Levi's I got my own
size at 23 holy crap I literally am not
even kidding you these are the best
shorts I've ever won of my life they
have these cute little slits on the side
sometimes they you can roll up on their
own which look really cool
I actually just washed mine I probably
worn means like over 20 times in a row
before I've washed them we're just so
bad so I will definitely have a code for
you guys for be done and I'll put it
right here right here for you
this white t-shirt is also from redone I
love their cheese I also have a black
tea from redone and I am just obsessed
their clothing and mostly denim is just
incredible so I recently found this
brand I am Gia online on Instagram and I
truly obsessed I purchased some of the
clothing Wow okay first of all how
beautiful are these pants obviously
they're fake leather they're vegan
leather I think and they cool zippers
everything is silver hardware which I
love and their double line so they're
incredibly comfortable I could not even
tell you these feel like I'm wearing
sweats when I put them on and that's why
I think it's so amazing these are under
$80 that's why I love them I also picked
up a yellow jumpsuit but this is not a
normal yellow jumpsuit because on the
inside it is double lined and misses
fleece material on real it is so
comfortable I am upset like I said
before high sweat high waist and sweat
pants are such a thing right now so I
purchased another pair and I am living
for these they just look so cute which
is a plain black top or you can even
wear the matching sweatshirt with knit
with it
I cannot talk today you can wear the
matching sweatshirt with it which I
absolutely love and it's yellow sign I
love it I think this past month revolve
has rented out a really cool house or
something in the Hamptons that a bunch
of influencers have been heading to so
Danielle I don't know her last name but
she is the Instagram we wore was and she
posted a picture in this yellow dress
from revolve and I went and bought it
it's so cute and I love that it was
yellow
from revolve also anyone who went to the
Hamptons that looks like so much fun so
this is the dress from revolve it's that
NBD brand and I got - size extra small
the back is my favorite part you'll see
it when I try it on and it's so
comfortable - so I went on to three
people the other day and I found such
good stuff so I'm going to show you what
I got so I got this incredible black
ribbed really comfortable set here's
what the top looks like it's a crop top
absolutely - the others dress my thing
just like that you guys can see how
comfy it is by flopping around
actually I don't know I went to see me
and these are Gauchos which I used to
wear Gauchos but now I wish that I saved
my old Gauchos because who would have
thought that Gauchos would ever be a
thing again so these are I always forget
to turn my phone on silent when I'm
filming anyways these are black amazing
ribs long pants they're so comfy I love
them and I got this set in a size extra
small I saw this in their sales section
it's just a super plain I don't through
the spandex material but it's definitely
stretchy if you know what I mean Urban
Outfitters has honestly been my favorite
place to shop lately how incredible at
this top it says V files I think that's
the name of the brand
yeah neat files I love this I got this
in a size small it's just a bubblegum
pink color and it's cropped and I love
that the sleeves are oversized I pair it
with this purple skirt this honestly
might be the coolest thing that I now
own in my closet and will own for the
rest of my life I got - extra small its
from Urban Outfitters as well and it is
so cool I love the Mac buttons and then
I'm
that this is kind of like that
patent-leather it's so shiny at Urban
Outfitters as well I got this incredible
set so gorgeous I can't wait to wear
this in Italy it is the brand sir but
it's from Urban Outfitters so it comes
with this adorable tube top I got - size
zero which is extra small I believe and
it just put this so cool and then here's
the bottom I got these I'm extra small -
they're just these really cute high
waisted white linen short cuz the back
looks like within zipper this - piece of
stone Urban Outfitters as well and it's
from Flint sky I love when sky I
actually only own one other thing from
Flint's guy I'm not like crazy obsessed
with this purple color I wish it was a
little bit more pop in I think it's the
cream flowers that throw off the purple
color I don't know but the skirt is so
gorgeous in this set it looks like this
and it's not to the floor long but it's
- above your ankles long so it's really
cute and it just funds down but I have
that zipper on the side so it plays mind
games with you so don't worry do not
need to unbutton all these buttons to
get on your body these are a must so
they're from B D G for Urban Outfitters
best Jean brand I love the way they fit
and I love the buttons instead of a
zipper super cute but there is a bum
rip on the booty and I love that because
it doesn't show too much but it shows
just the right amount that people I
don't know where I'm going with it
so I don't - o24 here's what the bottoms
look like and I live for them I love it
it sure is pretty dope only because you
can wear at the top in the to top or
skirt and it has pockets which a skirt
with pockets is like the greatest thing
that you can ever find am I wrong term
Urban Outfitters and it's super
comfortable I also wear it when I wear
it as a top I wear with these pants
because I kind of had it paired online
and photo so I wear these really cute
these are also that linen or globby
material I love anything this Beach
inspired this is definitely one of my
favorite things as well it's just this
really cute purple and yellow and blue
striped hoodie but it's cropped which is
even better I love
it's I don't know how to describe it
because you can just look at it and it's
basically just a crotch OD I got this
adorable denim top from Zara so cute I
love the weight structure and it's kind
of like a stingray looking thing I don't
know descend extra small I don't know
I'm going to style this yet I am leaving
for Italy I'll probably in Italy by the
time this video is posted so hopefully I
get a cute picture in this topper in
Italy I don't know why I'm thinking
about that right now but yeah I love
this shirt I think I own this rig black
set in almost every color now I have it
in white and a really cool burnt orange
color so I bought it in black it's from
Toby Hart ginger I these are my favorite
high-waisted shorts to wear in the
summer so that's why I want them in so
many different colors I get my specimen
size extra small on the top it just that
small just looks like this I have
actually been searching for a black set
and little tank top like this for so
long and I just couldn't find the right
one that I wanted so I went on to this
brand called mesh key I've never heard
of that believe it's Australian or it's
from the UK they honestly shift pretty
quick I don't mind size extra small it's
just this gorgeous silk will kink this
sure is so cute it's the brand Stevie
sister and I on - I - small small I'll
have this link down below so you guys
can find this as well it's just this
gorgeous floral cream and dark purple
pattern I like this because you can wear
it off the shoulder or kind of above
your shoulders depending on who you are
the person and then I like to actually
tied it to just where it was done on
super casual and cute I also got this
really cute floral set from Stevie
sister as well how gorgeous is this
pattern it's maybe blue I would say
wears that black I get so thrown off I
can never tell the difference between
really dark navy blue and black anyways
I love this set here are the pants I got
- size extra small they're super flowy
and they're a really great material and
the top is even cuter because it tied in
the front with tank top version of like
a tie front top and this is in a size
extra small as well of course I have to
have
from Dolph kill so I bought this and
it's the ragged priest I live for the
ragged priest they just designed sickest
clothes honestly so look how cute this
top is it's almost similar she's got
meets girly girl this is also from Dolph
kill but it is the ragged priests as you
guys can see it just says sick I don't
know if the word sick is overused now
but no one says it anymore by boss shirt
that has the word sick on it and it's
pretty sick I also got some jeans on the
ragged priest these are actually not
from Dolls kill
I love dragon priest jeans they are so
incredibly comfortable and I love
anything high-waisted what's really cool
about these particular jeans is they
have this red zipper going all up and
down the leg and you can unzip Hrant I
mean come on I don't know if these are a
thing because I remember who I think I
was
kendall Jenner she wore pants at this
length when I am I first day of six or
eight I wore Bermudas are these
considered Bermudas if they're cropped
jeans I don't know I remember kendall
Jenner wore something this length to
Coachella maybe two years ago but I saw
it online and they were on sale for $20
and I wanted to try them out and I
actually do I really like them they are
from the ragged priests as well and I
think they're so cool and it also came
with this cute chain which I love I
don't know you guys don't have to be the
judge of it but I personally think that
so many people can pull it off and I
wish I saw these more maybe I have to be
taller we'll find out I bought this
shirt because I love it it's from the
ragged crease I got on Dolph Jill as
well and it says ah weird kid and it's
literally not a better shirt to explain
me you guys probably have heard so much
about alo yoga by now I love alo yoga I
purchased leggings from them previously
and I just got these and I know how
boards are used so these are the two
tones kind of ballerina looking leggings
I get - size extra small they're so
comfy they're kind of like a camel color
right here and then this is like a
pretty pale pink and I also got this
sports bra that kind of goes with
color it just has some fun strap eNOS
going on in the front these are their
iconic looking leggings from a low yoga
I'm pretty sure you guys have seen these
on everybody so they look like this I
don't know how to describe this design
other than it's sick this is really cool
it is a fishnet long-sleeve allo yoga

work out Mitch wears such as a club with
friends to dinner anything you're
feeling I love it to share some shoes
