want to follow me on my Instagram is a
colonizer what without further ado I'd
love to get this video like look at this
bag how gorgeous look at these shoes
yeah so here we go
so start off the clothing haul I want to
talk about subdued because I love
subdued so much I've talked about them
in my whole before you guys know how
much I love them so I have amazing at
summer pieces to share with you guys
from them they are the Italian brand and
they only have one store in the US it's
on Broadway in Santa Monica
I'll have the address right here for you
guys or it's right here and I know where
it will pop up but the first thing that
I want to share with you guys is they're
twins that I just picked up how amazing
is this one piece it's white and black
color block so it looks like this on how
I'm obsessed
this is layering the softest material
whatever I got - size small and it's so
cute I can't wait to wear I'm actually
going to Italy at the end of July I'm
really good the next suit I have to
share with you guys this is amazing red
one it's also a one-piece and it's a
little cheeky on the bone which I love
and then the back just ruffles down and
it's that awesome ruby red color which
I'm totally vibing with and then I have
a really cute black bikini top that
lations up right in front I also got
this in a size small and it just has
these metal grommet eyelets on the front
that helps lace it up and this is so
flattering I haven't really seen a lot
of suits that tie up in the front like
this so I'm really happy that this is so
in style I also got a denim skirt and it
has amazing different denim along the
side it's just a different patch sewn in
which I love it's on both sides
I got mine this size small just looks
like that I really have just been
wearing cropped t-shirt and danced for
all the time and I don't own a pair of
destroyed boyfriend jeans I ended up
growing out of them or give them away or
something so I'm so happy now on these
these are just says 23 and they look
like this they're a light wash
they are so comfortable I've owned their
boyfriend Fitz before you guys always
ask what genes or genes are those work
genes are those so they're subdued they
have really great fits for the denim I
also met these gorgeous straight pants
they're super slowly and beachy they
just look like this with a cinched waist
so they're really stretching you could
just slide them on I owned this in black
and I literally wear it all the time so
I'm so happy that I now own it in red
it's just something it's just a super
comfortable red Ridge t-shirt it's one
size so it stretches like crazy and you
just tie it around as many times as you
want or you tied off the side this is
probably my favorite there's a gingham
design which I love they're just the
cutest little high waisted shorts ever
it can wear with a little cute crop and
they fit me so while these are a size
extra small oh you're so pretty I love
them
how amazing is the skirt it is that
Gangnam pattern I got this one
Reformation it also comes with a really
cool matching top but you can also tie
around the skirt you guys will know what
I'm talking about when I try it on so I
got my name is i0 and I tell you guys
what sizes I got stuff in because if I
don't and will comment down below the
description down below in the comments
what time did you get in that without
GMAT because I kind of won by about 105
few blocks I can know what size I need
to get so then why I play by my side is
if anyone is wondering because I see a
lot of those comments anyways I love
love this skirt it's so pretty and it's
such a nice material Reformation
honestly makes the best clothes ever and
then this actually wraps around the
spirit like a tying sash but I decide to
wear it which is totally meant to be
worn you can wear as a matching top how
amazing this is like a cute little
handkerchief top and you tie in the back
and then obviously this comes with
discourteous also a size zero as well
from Reformation I've been wearing these
every single day they're probably really
dirty I really need to wash them not -
size extra small they look like this
they're just plain black super comfy
ribs material pants and they kind of
flare out at the bottom which are
they don't go all the way thank Allah
but on the model when she wore then
you're like mid-length
but on you too totally in long pants
another one of my favorites that I
definitely have in this hole oh my gosh
my sister warrant what did she on it
there's pink stuff on it haha
and we know that my sisters bar whatever
they want so it's my fault okay this is
probably one of my favorite tops that I
buy so word if I've never seen anyone
wear anything really like this until
it's talking about
it's from our UI there's total dupes on
señora za full of these tops if you
can't afford them which a year ago I
can't afford this table but I'm obsessed
to fit the softest material ever so
amazing I got mine is very small you
guys will see help shoot it in the Trion
I've just been wearing it all over my
Instagram everyone isn't asking me where
I got this denim jacket it is from Urban
Outfitters it is their BBG brand I love
it the color blocking of a different
denim it's so sick so 70 there 95 100%
and it's a little bit crop I didn't mind
the size small and it fits me perfect I
was that you see this past weekend in
Vegas and I wore this adorable 2-piece
set from Urban Outfitters and it's a
towel materials it was really
comfortable I got mine in size extra
small it just lifts it super stretchy
and I love the colors on it I think
they're really retro and cool so yeah
the set just looks like this and I'm
definitely gonna be wearing it more hi
are you still videotaping yeah in the
middle filling right now it's go right
now was that Thank You DUI I know is the
first time on which it is this is
probably my favorite thing in this
entire haul I just picked this up at
doll till it's actually Steve Madden but
I got it on don't chill how amazing is
this bag you can in a pull it like a
purse if you want you're concealing it
or you just tuck that back right down in
there and wear it as a backpack which
you know I do every day because I am
obsessed with backpacks and I'm so happy
to only a new one my dad thinks
idealizes
you totally could be like this and I
totally showed you a line one that I
davai inset it sure is absolutely
amazing is from Zara and it has zipper
all the way down so it's really easy to
put on and making it seem like a part
right now but it's only so I have one
hand I got - extra small as kind of
ripped and destroyed all around the
stuff all around the stuff all on the
skirt and I just love the white paneling
of the zipper right here I think it's so
flattering and kind of modern looking
okay I totally lied I also own this best
game how adorable is this top it is from
Zara I got inside small it's just red
and white so cute flattering I actually
got really badly sunburned in the short
get loose oh it's in the shape of it you
guys can tell I don't know if you guys
can see because it's kind of turning
into a tan but I really got burnt in a
square on my chest because of this top
it's denim top is so amazing it's from
Zara and you tie it in the back like
this and then you tie it up and it looks
so adorable but it's just all denim I
got in size extra small this is
definitely one of my new favorite
outfits that I just picked up this is
from for love and lemons it's a matching
set so here's what the skirt looks like
it's so gorgeous
so when we're selling it on Poshmark so
I snatched it and bought it from them
because it was 30% off since 411 lemons
is really expensive I usually only buy
their stuff on sale and I got this
inside vegetable and I got the top and
sides actually small but I want the top
and the sides from all and so it's a
little snug but this is what the top
looks like it's so pretty this cup this
material is so soft to talk about some
shoes how gorgeous are these they are so
cool I know so many people have been
wearing this type of style lately but I
don't see a lot of the ruby red color
I've just been seeing a lot of yellow
and blue shoes so I'm really happy to
only the red ones they are suede so
they're super soft heel isn't that high
so a lot of people can walk in these
doesn't matter what age how amazing are
these shoes they're from Zara they're
the perfect platform summer heel to wear
to events and stuff I've already warned
them to multiple occasions and then
we'll see another Bowl and I love our
structure and the heel is on the
platform Oh
and all skill as well I got this
adorable t-shirt bodysuit how amazing
have you seen a teacher body see it
before because I haven't this is from
the brand wild socks but I dig it on
Dolph kill - size small I love the color
blocking of the baby blue of my pink and
the white it says local on it don't know
what that means but I love it it's so
comfortable with insane I also got this
on dolls kill I'm definitely going to be
wearing this skirt to Lollapalooza I
don't know why I plan my outfits don't
advance but I do I love it is the branch
jaded London which I have shopped with
them before the size extra small dolls
kill it has an amazing buckle on the
front right here and then the mesh stop
or the lining under the mesh top so you
can show your skin off a little bit more
which I love anything this yellow and
this is I got these boxer shorts on
don't kill over and President Obama
resistant they are stuffy there's sissy
woman's I love them I'll probably end up
wearing these so lulz we do that as well
I just think they're really cool and
I've seen other people style really cool
crop tops with them they're super
comfortable
they're great to wear when we're bathing
suits since they're committed that
waterproof material which they're not
waterproof but that dry fit material I
got this really dope jacket on gel kill
it is that civil regime brand there are
white flames on the sleeves
I repeat white flames that dope okay and
then it has some amazing pins that come
on this side and then some really cool
safety pins come on this act here's what
the back looks like it kind of is
similar to the khabar code which I
really like and this material done is
super comfortable and it's under $80 I
think it's actually under $70 and oh I'm
obsessed with it I don't know why I felt
the need to buy these sets but I did and
I'm obsessed so I got this sparkly blue
camo tube top and it comes with ties you
can just tie it around your waist
however you want so Q and I also bought
it in Campbell color so I thought this
is a tube top I wore this to EDC
well I already posted a picture of this
in my Instagram so it looks like this
amazing wraps around it also has
sparkles in it you guys can see it's
kind of like a highlighter it's in
itself and then here's what the pants
look like they're bootcut they're high
waist is they look like this there's a
pretty dope I'm lesson to talk about
some of my favorite jewelry I literally
have been wearing in every single video
this necklace is super cool I am
horrible speaking English this method is
amazing it's just a gold chain with a K
and Lum in acrylic how works anything to
I can see it as queer and then the other
jewelry that I have are just these
gorgeous little gold necklaces and
they're perfect for layering they're
from Instagram is axj underscore a
underscores de l of course we'll have
everything link down below so you guys
can check these out from louie class I
also got some really nice silver chokers
that I can share with you guys I like to
layer a bunch of solar shutters together
as well I know you guys mostly see me
wearing gold I do also wear silver
chokers so here is some of the styles
that I picked up from mouhot they look
like this you guys can see them when I
try them on for you but I love AHA I
love mixing different textures and
chokers together I think they look
amazing since we're talking about
jewelry I also got this really gorgeous
layering piece it's from Lulu's calm you
guys don't need to spend like $60 plus
on a single choker you can totally get
affordable pieces like this so I bought
this acting for $12 on lulu.com it comes
with all three and I just said wearing
it so much so there are cheaper
alternatives to layering necklaces and I
definitely think this is what my
favorite ones that I own everyone isn't
wearing the attached so of course you
know you're going to get one I love them
they're so comfortable they're just
super cute to wear when you're having a
bad hair day or you want to hide
yourself from the world I got my own
Brixton I'm looking for that brands
before they definitely cloud
pasen I love the ragged priests they
have the best genes so I have to pick up
another pair these are really poised to
toe DIY these but they have a silver
chain dripping dripping draped across
the huge riff on the side and then
there's also a risk on the knee which I
love our students are so fun I can still
wear these in the summer because that
night gets cold here here are the
amazing shorts that I have from Thome
our gender they're so comfortable I own
this set and white like I said before
this color is amazing it's kind of like
a muted mustard or except with a mustard
copper color this is a size extra small
this material is amazing it's just a
ribbed cotton I love it
Jason's from Toby Hart ginger I'm
obsessed this color is literally taking
over the world I swear I want to know I
want to own everything in yellow so I
got minus X small it's cropped it's just
one of those super comfy crewneck
cropped sweatshirts
I love Toby Hart ginger is law I own so
many cute sets from them at ASIS I got
this really cool jacket I've been seeing
people on Instagram where and ASOS never
really ran out of stock with it I've had
it in my shopping cart two times and
then I just decided to finally buy it
because look how cool the back is I bet
you control you di widest if you take a
normal denim jacket and then take extra
denim that you have sew it on hand sew
it on along the back and then cut it up
and destroy it I think it would be
really simple
definitely tedious but we look amazing
else winds is definitely at one of my
favorite bathing suit brands so I have
this amazing one piece to share with you
guys how amazing is this color blocking
with a black and white I love it and
then it wakes up in the middle the back
is entirely open I got - life small and
it fits me perfect I also got this
adorable one-piece I'm obsessed it's
floral literally this is the softest
material ever and it's just a halter so
it cinches up and you can wear it keep
Joker with it also just got this in the
mail it's amazing white cropped right
chair from shadow hello just a shadow
pillow on the collar bones right here
and then there's pink camo all of
another sleeves I love it I got this
adorable little set outfit from guess
obviously need Zone B
don't go together but this is what I got
on the same day again so got this
amazing off-the-shoulder white top it's
Roush so it's super stretchy and fun you
can call it ribbed if you want to just
look like that so comfortable and then I
wore it to a guest event with the
matching not matching with these pants I
paired it with these pants that are also
from gasps there's just gorgeous baby
blue color they're beachy you can cinch
um and tie my weights if you want or
kind of wear them low waisted I'm really
5 3 so I can't wear them with low
waisted on last night were like 7 inch
heels I also got the issue what this
isn't there from guess I'm obsessed with
them interested in unique color they are
suede they're super comfy cuz they're
that espadrille style if you know what
I'm talking about you can lace them up
the legs you want or just time around
your ankles and they don't have to lace
up the leg I love them they're so
flattering they're that platform style
so they're really easy to walk in this
is also from pretty little thing I
actually really like this it's super
soft but it's see-through I don't know
if you guys can see the tag through the
skirt right now probably the lighting is
really harsh so it makes it look better
on camera than it really is
I also got this on pretty little thing
this was literally ten dollars and is
the best piece of clothing I on I also
owe it in black so I'll have this link
down below I definitely recommend
clothing that this kind of material from
pre Olsen I just don't know about their
other stuff I also got these sweats that
have hair all over them I warm on the
plane like three days I've warmed three
in a row and then I wore them on the
plane they're just these amazing irises
