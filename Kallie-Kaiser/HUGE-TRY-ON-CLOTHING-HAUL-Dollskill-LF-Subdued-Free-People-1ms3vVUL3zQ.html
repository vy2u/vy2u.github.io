video I don't know how I have more
clothes share with you guys but we are
doing another try on haul there is some
pretty bomb pieces in here you're going
to want to stick around I have some
summer clothes some winter clothes some
of those in-betweens that you don't know
what season but you can wear it for all
so I'm very excited if you guys want to
follow me on my Instagram is at Kaiser
and my snapchat is Kellyanne but without
further ado here we go okay I never know
what to start off with in haul so if you
guys could tell me do shoes jewelry
pants shirts jackets first let me know
down in the comments I'd be amazing to
start off the hall I'm showing you guys
everything I received from subdued they
let me go to the store to hell with them
and she got a few pieces so I'm
expecting I can show you guys what I got
if you live in Santa Monica you are very
lucky because they have one store in the
US and it is in st. Helena called on
Broadway
they aren't Italian brand I'll leave a
link down below if you watch for their
website everything I have right here and
they're interim as well you can check
them out but the first piece that I want
to share with you guys I don't even know
what to start with because probably this
I own those sets with it it's an awesome
army green color green is actually my
favorite color so those people that
don't know it has this amazing Frady
table all along the bottom I can not
talk it's perfect for spring it's not
completely cropped so you could still
wear it with really high waisted pants
and it looks really good and then this
is cool because this is velcro so you
could also take this off which I love
it's just a perfect going out jacket for
the night or dinner or even during the
day for lunch
this is probably my absolute favorite
thing I got out if you guys can tell
with this lighting but it is sparkly
it's just glowing
I love the scalloped design all along
the rim the sleeves and then the bottom
of this shirt this looks so good layer
with a white bra under or a light pink
one I know you guys can tell how
beautiful and Sheen mrs. I own want to
be in black from subdued in this long
sleeve and then when they came out with
this in white I had to have it and then
I want to pick out some spring pieces as
well so I got this amazing knit and
white Spanish dress
ready material as I said it's in it I
got my size small I Oregon mono medium
yep this is a medium this is so
flattering on me it looks really driven
high-waisted it's perfect for you can
layer this underneath anything so
doesn't matter what season you eridan
but I love the way this shirt looks
since it's be neck with layered
necklaces and stuff like that I think it
would look really great with this hair
look as well but I should like to stop a
lot I have been obsessed with down the
trip lately so I got this amazing bomb
denim skirt mine in size extra small on
stage some subdued as well as a great
denim color it has some phrase going
little bottom side that if you wash it
these will even be more extreme and
spray up if that's what you're looking
for I have been looking for a really
nice pair of high-waisted light wash
denim shorts because I wanted something
that remind me of you guys and this was
the closest thing I found I love them
they're very flattering on my body type
I just think it's so horrible I were
done in short all the time and
especially since I was in California now
you can wear it down in the shorts with
an oversized jacket or an oversized
sweatshirt and it still feels like
summer here I wear sweaters all year
round is because they're so easy to
throw on over 2t me to the beach
or I just wear them underneath with a
heavy jacket so I got this really soft
ribbed knit sweaters that my favorite
part is the sleeves are so close to a
bell bottom of like flare out pants if
that makes sense I know I decide small
Dan is so soft the neck is very
flattering because it just kind of goes
straight across and it fits really nice
on your collarbones and you're getting
to see
I can't look like I'm so very high
because the shirt I'm wearing doesn't
allow me to but you guys to miss female
amazing the colors I have been buying so
many light pink clothing lately I
normally hate the color pink but light
pink to me just is amazing I love it I
love it so much I got this hoodie in
light pink as well I got - eyes medium
because I wanted to be a little bit
oversized on these you guys can to see
how comfortable this is from the camera
and when I try it on I love the way
light pink looks with denim it's all
definitely wearing this you'll probably
just see me being lazy on Valentine's
Day and and moving on with the hall I
have been
with oversized sweatshirts lately so I
got this black one from shadow Hill I
got this in a size medium I wish I got a
size large just because I wanted to be a
little bit longer I like anything that
goes past my cross so if I wear a cool
lace pants or anything I just covered my
thumb and crotch area so this one just
has lightning stripes all along the
sleeves which I think look amazing this
is really fun too you guys can probably
see the lint all over it that's really
simple it's just a slap oversized hoodie
I've just been living in this I need a
washing week and LF stores is having
their sale going on right now for the
end of the season where everything is
60% off so of course I have a pop in
there and I got this amazing army green
color with embroidered roses roses all
along the sleeves I'm absolutely
obsessed I don't know what size it is
because it's vintage
I think it's first-of-a-kind yeah anyone
who knows that branch and anyone knows
no LS stores they don't have anything
online but if you want to find anything
and the Rose in for your stuff on it go
to n run Sam calm and if you want fun
they're jeans it's Karma am calm I also
got this oversized camo long-sleeve at
ellis stores as well they just sewed on
flannel on to the sweet so this is also
vintage so I couldn't tell you what size
this is but I love it I posted a picture
on my Instagram init the other day and
everyone said that they loved it so much
so if you're trying to find something
like this just go to the LF sale if you
live on the east coast or west coast or
I think they have stores in Miami and be
wrong but yes I love it I love men's or
unisex clothing lately so I went to the
men's section of Urban Outfitters and I
got this Jersey in a size small if you'd
open out 50 or stuffy I do not know what
is it sexy I got stuffy I wanted a
sweater and stuffy for so bad for so bad
for so long it just has these black and
white stripes on please obviously a mesh
type sturdy material looks like that
this great camel color I'm just living
for this I want so I picked up the best
day on planet earth the other day it is
this amazing metallic hologram skirt the
lighting just makes it way better
please but it honestly is so cute and so
flattering it's not completely tight
like a miniskirt which I love I got in a
size 2 from Topshop when I was in New
York the other day but it's just my new
face so I was shopping on three people
the other day and I got some really nice
XP tops for those of you don't know if
that is side boob so I got this amazing
black spandex really stretchy one I
don't know how to explain it it really
beats it it just had a smooth down the
side so it shows a lot of ESPE if that's
what you're going for and it's kind of a
higher neck so it looks really good when
you layer like big chunky necklaces with
it I got another one of their shirts in
a black lace material which i think is
just the most flattering thing ever you
actually see the arm page of the huge
swoop down the side and this one is more
of a turtleneck design which I really
like and it has scallops all on the neck
which is so flattering and then Urban
Outfitters retracting and they sending
amazing light pink really suits the
entire back is backless and it just
looks so flattering on the body as you
guys can see it just looks like this on
the bottom where you can hook it like a
bodysuit and then they also sent you
this amazing light pink denim jacket I
have wanted a light pink denim you guys
could for so long mine is in a size
small it's the BBG brand and it just
looks like this if your song it itchy
and you probably have seen me close to
this already oh it smells so good right
so like peach sugar and for those of you
who have not heard of rebase denim you
need to get yourself a pair of these
jeans they're so amazing they have a
star on the thumb have you ever seen
anything greater I have it so I wear
size 24 you fit me so well they're super
high waisted and the best part is that
they're bell-bottoms I didn't get the
crops the crops once I got the flare one
and they're amazing they all have this
really nice seam that goes all the way
down so people are tied 3 or 5 for like
me make you look taller and it looks
like to talk about some shoes with you
guys come on this isn't real
these are the coolest hologram shoes
I've ever seen my entire life obviously
since I have lighting on them right now
they're reacting like this but this is
how they look when you walk around in
the Sun with them I posted
in stream as well but other than that
they're a little bit of more matte
finish I'm not as crazy they're from the
brand why are you with anyone who knows
that brand you know that they make stick
shoes like this I got - five six i jegg
it's about the LS sales so they want
sales like 50 bucks but you can also
find an online at zeusie
I'll link wherever you can find it
online down below the search box and
then I got to use Jeff Campbell babies
they are amazing I have been really into
colorful patchwork with denim lately so
I picked up these is an amazing zipper
down the center which doesn't work it's
fake zippers on the side the CH on teal
makes them really comfortable to walk
around in I did a shoot eni's the other
day and they photographed so well but I
get to see how amazing and we need to
say anything else about them I got under
size six and normally six and a half
these are so cool I'll show you actually
other one looks like - you can see them
next to each others this company we can
advise research me and they send me the
cutest sweat - ever look at these
daughters so it has a really fit
three-way elastic band which I'm
obsessed with and I don't know if you
guys have watched my videos or not buy
with success with stars anything that
has stars and look for so can we talk
about the bottom of the joggers because
they're amazing and it came with this
awesome hoodie that's just blast
oversized it has dippers on the sides or
pockets which I'm obsessed and it has
this built in t-shirt at the bottom
obviously doesn't go all the way up it's
just sewn in at the bottom for that look
I got my eye size medium I believe and
then the joggers are in a size small
medium I have been living this lately I
probably should wash that to Planet Blue
has 75% off on their website about two
weeks ago so I picked up some stuff
online on there I got this amazing
bodysuit in a size extra small I did
wish I got a size small it's a little
bit tight on me I got it in a turtle mag
it looks really good laid with a bra
underneath and then you guys can just
see it's a quality suit as a bum it's
about this Atlanta blue it's just a
really nice silk Tami I love the look
with lace and little bow detailing too
I think that's really flattering this is
just perfect for summer and spring
coming up which I know I'm really ahead
of the game right now but whenever
there's a sale I have to buy stuff I
normally don't wear such as girly but I
absolutely have loved this pattern for
way too long
so I got in size extra small from show
me an emu I saw that brand but I got on
Planet moon it's just this cute crop top
for summer for spring a Holly just we're
on spring break with some high-waisted
pants or something I have been so into
you guys - what is she holding I have
been so into huge chunky layer and
silver necklaces lately so I'm one of
the dog kills and anyone that doesn't
know dogs kill you need to shop on there
because they have the cool stuff so
first of all I'll show you guys some
chain belts that I got you just pop
these on to your jeans or anything that
has belt loops and they look so cool so
I got this silver chains I want and then
I got this um chain saw one it's pretty
much the same I probably don't need to
but they're you solving for ten bucks
my dog pill just so nice and obviously I
like the double on the trip shoe box and
then I got some of these that just look
really nice layers and chunky on the
neck this is originally a choker you
could tie it like this as you compete
but I decided to just wear like back of
a normally my black hawk with it and
then these chokers are really great I
got this one from forever 21 it's just
so really simple I guess what's a chain
look as well and then this is from dog
kills well it's more of a lariat or
large yet design Emma you have work
properly but just really heavy and
chunky and beautiful so go layer
together - if you're trying to find
cheap silver necklaces go on there and
then one my favorite Etsy shop is moon
stock chokers I absolutely love them so
I got this silver choker it's just
really simple and fun and then I also
picked up a new choker at new clasp I
have been pronouncing lowly class wrong
this entire time actually we we class
and I got to shake your choker it just
has really beautiful gemstones or moving
stones hanging on a little pendant from
the necklace or however you just ride
that but obviously beautiful if you're
wanting to refine any of these chokers
they're all Louie class my favorite
