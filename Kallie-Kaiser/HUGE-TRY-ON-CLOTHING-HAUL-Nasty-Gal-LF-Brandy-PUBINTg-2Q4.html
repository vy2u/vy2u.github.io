percent off of all their brands so the
first pair of Jeffrey Campbell's that I
got are these I'm sorry this hardware is

personally like it on there and then
it's a wedge heel pointed silver toe

bag that holds everything inside looks
like that for some jewelry that I picked
up recently I got these hoops at Urban
Outfitters they're the perfect size I
just think they look super nice
I've taken some photos in the lung
Instagram you guys have seen those and
then I also got these smaller ones at a
Kate little boutique they kind of have a
different texture eyes around the ring
but I normally never wear hoops and I
decided to follow the trend and now I'm
addicted and I can't take them off okay
everyone knows my favorite jewelry is
Lily clasp so I picked up some new
pieces I got this leather silver choker
that is tan I love this I think it's so
sick and then I also picked up another
choker this one has a diamond design in
the middle and then there's just these
really pretty see-through crystal stones
on the sides um this is adjustable and
Dublin is a different chain than the
ones I'm wearing right now these are all
from Lully clasp as well except I think

delicate and beautiful favorite favorite

description box these are so bomb
I just don't obsessed with them the
frillies actually make my legs a little
bit a little bit longer I might cut them
and trim them a bit but other than that
I'm obsessed with these and I think

nice boyfriend jeans as you guys can see
and to go with them where is it

really love this trend let's unbox the
tights for you guys on camera I got

so these are cards and them as well I
got these in a size 23 I love the rips
they literally go all the way up to your
crotch area but the bottoms are really
fun too
they're kind of that mom fits and then
the Richard is really nice there's a
foodie rip down here and then a color
discolor discolor a discoloration in the
denim here no I really like these I
definitely been wearing them a lot of
t-shirts and sneakers
I'm car Mart also got another pair of a
nice denim wash with me Rip's they're
just normal skinny jeans I folded them
up at the bottom
I love jeans I wear them more than
leggings I wear them t-shirts I try and
dress them up I could even wear the
makiel I honestly just love jeans
they're so comfortable so I really like
the denim wash on these and I got a size
24 I am tried to find vintage search for
the longest time ever so I got these at
the LF sale this one is white it's my
first of a kind
I love the rips all up and down the hips
the back just looks like this it says
they're Levi's yes they are leave as you
can tell fried from the buck design and
then these are Parmar denim the front is
shorter than the back which I really
like I got this in a size 23 the rips
are just as fun and then I like the
metallic gold gold this is gold
I like the metallic gunmetal design on
the buttons I think these are really
cute and this is a nice denim wash I
have never purchased anything on show me
your muumuu until now I picked up this
really nice charcoal gray t-shirt just
as California on it with a ranch Oh
inside got some cacti down there yeah
super plain in the black in the back I
can never speak English I already own
this top in red so I wanted to get it in
white it is from rumor ot at the LF sale
it just you can fold it fold it you can
tie it so many different ways which I
love and then the sleeves are super
flowy and delicate which I really like
it's just that cheesecloth material so I
love that I also picked up that wrap top
in a starry design and this is just
black and white stars stars are my new
favorite thing I swear they're my new
obsession I love stars
um but yeah just try this a bunch of
different ways which I'll show you guys
in the try on clips but I really just
like the sleeves and these tops fit me
really nice I did pick up another wrap
top this one is velvet and it will be
great for the fall / winter months that
I'm coming
in the end of the arms elastic as you
guys can see so it kind of has a tight
fit right around your wrist and then you
can just cross it over your chest tight
many different ways high in the middle I
got this in a size small and it's from
the plan of blue sail I also picked up
the super chic black white embroidery
skirt I got at the LF sail it's that
brand
Malu mel out I'm butchering it I don't
know how to pronounce it I got it in a
size small if it's so nice okay / cute I
know comes with a matching top but I
didn't get as a teepee set just because
I found myself wearing other stuff with
as well I'm looking for a shirt that
looks so good with it ah this shirt I
think this would look so bomb this is
from the brand Emma and Sam I think it's
sold out on their website but they're
still having a sale until Sunday as well
this is so cute has these stars right on
the chest area and you can wear like a
bomber I'll let with it in the back I
don't know how many times I had ball in
this video so I apologize in advance but
I think that this on matching would look
so good together tell me if I'm wrong
this dress kind of reminds me of rat and
Boas tie-dyed but I got this at Planet
Blue sale as well the sleeves have
elastic at the bottom so they kind of
have a bell looking or like a bubble
look around the arms this is a v-neck
crisscross at the I believe it's like
right below the chest and then it's just
a flowy dress it's really beautiful I
love how hippy it is the entire bag is
open and I don't you guys can see you'll
see when I try it on but I really like
the way this looks and it's super fun I
really want to photograph in it there I
said it I have one of these shorts for
the longest time ever because so many
people wore them to Coachella and I just
love how chill they look I got them to
size 24 they are car Mart denim as well
the bag is look like this they're just
super plain and then the front looks
like that I'm definitely thinking about
doing a DIY patch and rips with denim
video strangers because my other
my video has so many requests you
another one so look up for that
my favorite thing probably that I picked
up this month is this denim jacket with
the frills all at the bottom I am
obsessed
it's from first-of-a-kind I got that
left sale as well oh my gosh I just
think it's so fun then that the denim is
really nice and thick and it is a bit
baggy around my shoulders because since
it's vintage I don't know what size it
is but no I really like this flf so I
decided to get a lace-up flannel design
I think they had this in their Fall
collection last year but they happen to
have a shipment and I went to the store
on the right day and I was able to get
one of these on sale I really liked them
it's a thick flannel material I just got
one in red and white and then the top is
cut off so it's not a funny or anything
but it's super flowy and big and I dig
it
I picked up this really pretty white
Airy sweater it's a size small but it
runs big so depending on your body type
as yourself I don't know what size would
fit you best but this is more of a
boyfriend look on me so I like to wear
with tight skinny jeans and then since
the v-neck is so open it looks so bomb
if you layer it with one of these
lighter tank tops underneath and like a
bralette or something like that
and then I also picked up this sweater
it's just black I got it in a size
medium so it would be a boyfriend style
on me the top is just a choker going on
like so and then the v-neck it's like
this it's not too low-cut so a bunch of
people will totally be attracted to that
the cut is not super cropped but it does
go to about your pant line whoa I'm so
pale right there ah
it is the long-sleeve and I think this
is perfect to just wear to lunch or
dinner or even with one of the denim
skirts I got talk about some basics I
picked up at the LF sale this is Emma
and Sam it's just a really low-cut deep
v t-shirt with a rib design I really
like the latest fit it looks so good
with this latter tank top this one's on
MN Sam as well I don't know if it's sold
out yet but its link down below in
description it looks like this you can
wear it the normal way which this is the
front and this is the back but everyone
Instagram and everyone on the earth
decides to wear it backwards so that it
has an awesome ladder bralette look when
you layer it with anything which I
totally hopped on that trends and I do
it anyways I also picked up the white
ladder tank top in white as well just
because it looks so good layered with
sweaters anything you really going to
wear it with I also picked up this black
ribs sweater material shirt it's not a
bodysuit which I really love just
because I don't really wear body suits a
lot it has a choker design I love that
and then the deep V isn't too low so
it's not revealing if you're more of a
modest person it looks really nice on
the body I also picked up this super
mesh chill super mesh it's very mesh so
much I also picked up this super basic
black mesh bro tank I just like the way
this fits I got into size extra small
this would look cute leggings jeans
boyfriend jeans anything like that
Planet Blue had a huge sale at a
warehouse somewhere in Santa Monica so
of course nothing better to do I went to
it and everything was either ten or
twenty dollars so I got this super cute
swooping gray long-sleeve top it swoops
down close to your belly button so you
can layer it with a really nice bra let
and the arms are drapey with that bell
bottom hippie thing going on I love it
this is a really nice gray color and
it's just super beachy oh my gosh I love
these I got these at the Planet Blue
sale as well they are just these velvet
gold and red slip dresses I got them
both in a size extra small they are so
flattering this one is cool because it
is gold I don't know if you guys can see
how shiny it is I love it and then the
red one I think these would look so good
with a denim jacket over it with some
fishnet tights and some stick boots that
are kind of platforms I don't know and
then here's the red one this will look
really pretty for the holiday season I
hope to wear it a lot at that lifestyle
I also got this really cute vintage
t-shirt has drafts on it it's a v-neck
design and then the sleeves are sewn to
be
rolled it up which I really like the
back is completely open with all of
these frillies going on and it just
looks really cool like if you have a bro
light showing underneath I love that
look I picked up another vintage t-shirt
this one's red I recently haven't been
picking up some red things just because
I really like the way red looks on me
now I used to not this sleeves are
rolled up like this and you don't live
near an LF you can make a ladder design
on any t-shirt just like this I've made
a video on it if you love to check it
out but other than that I like the way
this fits me it's just a bit baggy on me
so I like that boyfriend look I have
some broad lots to share with you guys
so the first one I got at the planet
blue sale it has glitter on the front of
it I love it clasps in the front as well
this is more of a dark royal blue design
and then the top is like a stretchy
ribbon material so it's super
comfortable this would look great on a
same layered with anything fun and then
I got a nude bralette because I thought
it would look great layered under white
sweaters it's just a crisscross design
in the front and it's that stretchy
spandex material I got this at the LF
sale I also got a white one at the LF
sale just because I don't have anything
to wear under white tank tops or white
t-shirts or white sweaters again um the
front is really nice because it kind of
has a flattering I don't even know how
to describe this design I'll just hold
it up and show it to you guys it just
has a nice crisscross around the chest
area and in the back it's really open
and strappy and then this one I've been
seeing so many people wear just plain
white tee tops with bomber jackets and
high-waisted jeans so I really want to
wear that with this my dream is to get
the girls to wear pink bomber jacket I
that one I just haven't been able to go
on to Melrose yet and grab it but this
one's from JCPenney it was like four
bucks and it is actually a really thick
material so I don't even think you need
to wear a strappy brought with it a
brandy melville I got some cute graphic
t-shirts I have worn this so many days
in a row I can't even Maddi justify to
this how many times have an appointment
shirt in my life so far
oh look um no this is my new favorite
t-shirt I'm obsessed it just says good
vibes all over it's from brandy I also
picked up a Metallica t-shirt I have
listened to Metallica Metallica is great
they were actually a Lollapalooza one
year NOAA's last year and they were
looking good here's the back superbomb
here's the front it's just a cozy
graphic tee I love Brandi mumbles
graphic tees they're really comfortable
from Connemara done them as well I got
these black jeans they just have rips on
the knees and then the bottoms are just
thrilled out there kind of just that
open scene I love that look the back is
super plain I got these are the size 25
I wish I got a size 24 just because
they're tighter but I always have one in
a black pair of boyfriend jeans I picked
up some nice leather pants at the planet
blue sale as well they are more a
legging finish with an elastic waist I
really like them at the knees the sewing
job right here is really flattering

have some fake pockets you know thank
