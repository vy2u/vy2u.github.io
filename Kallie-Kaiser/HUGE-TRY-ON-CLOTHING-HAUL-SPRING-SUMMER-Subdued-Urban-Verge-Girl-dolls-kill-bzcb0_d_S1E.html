wearing them every day these are their
boyfriend fit and I got into place 24

uncuffed them but I think in cuffs the
bond is so cute these have fit me so
nice I really just wear these to college
every single day they're so comfortable
this is definitely one of my favorites
because you guys know how I love
versatile clothing so this is just a
really comfy stretchy black t-shirt it's
so versatile because these are
wraparound ties you can make them fancy
casual I actually wore this out to the
club one night would be sick Mel bottles
and velvet pants belt it was perfection
I got mine in this size oh it's one size
it's super stretchy too so you don't
have to worry the find would be perfect
white basic tee is so difficult so I'm
so happy I own this now it's this
cropped white t-shirt I got my in this
size medium because I like the whites
it's on my shoulders and this is so
flattering so comfortable I love basics
I'll always love basics and I love a
little tie right here kind of hangs up
as a cross
above your belly button it's just
probably my favorite thing that I got
how amazing is this black with a chain
top it has that awesome eyelid design as
well
they're just laces up all my our
suppliers this is really nice with these
beautiful boyfriend jeans I love these
together I've already worn it together
also this shirt FAT FAT aggress
photographs so well and this is a one
size as well you guys will just see how
good this looks on the Tryon portion I
don't own one thing this pastel green
color until now which who would have
thought I think this color needs to
exist in more clothing it's so beautiful
I love the way it looks with my blonde
hair this is a one size that cropped
sweatshirt I love love love it I've worn
it six times already and I've only owned
it for about two weeks I also have been
living in this sweater it is a cropped
long-sleeve zip up how amazing it's kind
of very just because I've been wearing
it so much so that's why it's so
wrinkled I got mine in this size small
it's just the most comfortable material
a super knit really stretchy and it
looks really great with anything you can
make this casual or fancy as well this
is a really beautiful color I haven't
gotten too worn this yet but I'm
actually going home to Chicago this
weekend so I'm really excited to wear
this amazing thick gray sweater it
definitely is breathable too so it's
perfect for spring and it has the
awesome eyelet design with the lace up
going on this is so flattering and it's
a little bit of a crop I have always
wanted one of these straight across
plain white ribbed little sweater tees
or knit tees I love basics you guys know
that I will have me shirts welcome to
stretch them out so this is really
stretchy as well this is one size so
flattering and what's really nice is you
don't really miss through this material
excuse me the material is pretty thick
so you don't have to worry about it it
sure is amazing it from from lemon
lemons I got mine in size extra small
how amazing is all of this fringe at the
bottom I'm obsessed the back is plain
like this and it's not playing there's
so much going on I love the lace
embroidery on it and then there's little
scalloped design up here on the top it
is high-waisted on me and they
is so flattering how it just goes all
the way around the skirt I am wearing
this to Coachella I mean I don't want to
give away my outfits but I already have
a Coachella lookbook so I have seen this
sweater that's black and white stripes
it's so beautiful I've seen it float
around on Instagram for quite Ryle it is
being naked tiger I got it online it can
get some Australian boutique but they
have it cropped permanently already cut
for you which is so nice and mine is a
little bit stretched out now just
because I've been wearing it a lot so my
kind of sits more off the shoulders I
don't kind of prevent that and the
sleeves are super long how amazing is
this I got this from Isabelle's cabinet
I'll have it linked down below for you
guys it's just perfect for any festival
I swear I'm obsessed with the silver
chain it's just a really cool silver
chain bra I can't wait to see how I
style this I don't know what I want to
do with it yet okay I think I love this
one more I don't know if you guys can
see from my lighting super bright but
this is a gold one was really beautiful
silver diamonds all across the deck and
then it comes with a choker pad so it
looks just like this on the body wow
this is so beautiful this is also from
Isabelle's cabinet I will as well at it
link down below but you can layer this
on top of a bikini and it would look so
cool otherwise we're underneath and
cheese flow sure and how to have it show
through repeat strip you cannot talk
peace through a little bit
I love denim jackets so much I've been
getting really sick of just my plain
damn jacket so this is so cool because
it has these silver studs all over the
entire jacket you could totally DIY this
if you're into tedious work you can just
by snug on Amazon I got this when it was
the LFC oh and it's car more denim how
amazing you can't get this online which
stinks but you could go into car bargain
calm and see if there you have any
similar denim jacket like this other
words I would totally check out at sea
or something because this is not a new
staple in my closet this probably
doesn't even look like it's a shirt for
a human
oh my gosh now that is holding up on
camera it's actually so small it looks
like it's from my American Girl doll but
yes this is a shirt across
up it goes across the shoulder so you
can show your pop and highlighted
collarbones if you want I got this on
the side small kind of wish I got a size
medium it's Super Stretch eats from are
you am i but I love the black ridge
sweater material so comfortable and this
is so cool I probably won't be writing
this on everything basis just because
it's too revealing for me but I might be
wearing it to Coachella I also love this
sure is from our UI as well this one
doesn't look at Smallville unit on
camera this is super stretchy I got mine
size extra small kind of wish I got a
size small just because my boobs are 32
C in a bra and just looks like this has
rig sweater material as well and it just
has this awesome what is it called
frills ruffles and it was so flattering
on I love this shirt I recently had been
shopping online at new website this is
from Virgil I love it I got - size extra
small I believe a size 8 which is
actually a size small extra small it's
just this amazing fishnet turtleneck but
it's a tank top or grow tank designs why
I love about this is so many people were
wearing fishnet during the fall and
winter season so this makes this you
could wear it in this summer or spring
at night and it fits right in I got this
on versatile as well it's kind of an
off-white cream color Superfly ring
looks really great I love wearing white
I have really porcelain skin and you
guys can tell and why it's to look so
good
I love it I got my size six which is
extra small and it's the brand Rose
bullet just looks like this is kind of
classy shirt so if you wear with jeans
you really always put together which is
nice for just such a comfortable
material you can tie the front or back
depending on what you like I got this on
verge girl as well I just thought it was
really great to throw over anything in
the spring or summer time like a tank
top a teeny Rolla you can tie it or just
wear a ton of cardigan cardigan is
around my style so I do like to tie it
or wrap around my body multiple times
okay this top is so cute I love it it
has these awesome silver hardware
circles just sewn into the design
somehow some way and the back of the
dress will stress otherwise it's just a
holey stretchy
I don't even know how to describe this
shirt that's just
you just cross off I don't know how I'm
gonna dial it yeah because I don't
really have a bralette I might just want
our white tube top underneath which I
have a really cheap one front that I got
from forever 21 or JCPenney or something
but it is the brand rehab size small for
Coachella I was really wanting a new
person lesson but I just couldn't find a
pair that was really had my eye set and
I walked into north strum Saturday and
there ray bands were around 25% off and
I'm like this is meant to be please let
there be a style that I fall in love
with and I saw the style I have not seen
it yet before how amazing are these are
so beautiful they're all black I think
they kind of have a tint of a tortoise
around this lens right here that could
be wrong they're gold rimmed they're not
polarized I believe but these are
everything I think they're so flattering
I cannot wait to hire them I feel so
weird wearing sunglasses inside right
now but oh my gosh if you have been
looking for new Ray Bans I really only
wear Ray Bans just because they last so
long and get my face so well so I
definitely would recommend looking into
this style I can link down below for you
guys upset so I walked into adidas and I
saw these pants and I needed them in my
life just because I see so many people
wear sportswear it's street style so I
don't know if these are soccer pants or
not but I love adidas and I love this
red chain color I think it's so
flattering I got mine in an extra large
in the girls section they are so much
cheaper if you can fit into a little
girls section like me um so there were
only 35 dollars compared to I think the
women's are $60 and I don't know if they
have X Direction lower so I know that
this is extra-large in the juniors girl
section okay this is cool
I got this on shade London I found out
about this brand from doll kill and then
now actually just go on their domain and
a shop on their so I love their logo how
dope is that this shirt is so cool it's
kind of a higher crop so it can show
underboob depending on your boob size I
got my size extra small it's just this
amazing silver hardware with a solid
matte black neoprene material these tops
are honestly so perfect for any
and also the first color I got it in is
this amazing rustic orange color wow it
shows it beautifully with dis lighting
it is suede sorry it is velvet I got
mine I think it's one size fits all
actually and these are only $20 on the
SE page home cooks karma they also sell
home cooked karma and don't kill
sometimes but I would just go there I
see page I'll have it linked down below
and I also got the velvet halter top in
a black color too and I'm just livin for
you you can tighten them however much
coverage you want and they look so good
with them of course I am live for wrap
around shirt so I have this amazing red
one I got this in the size extra small
it's from Nasty al I love it I won't be
able to link this down below because
it's sold out but I can wrap it around a
bunch of time so just tie it in the
middle one and it's perfect for the
spring or summer plus I bright my hair
as you guys can tell super blonde now
and I just want to buy everything
red and yellow which is so bizarre
because I usually used to only wear
black and white clothing and gray
clothing so this is a step up for me I
have some colorful pant options to share
with you guys which is fun I got these
light pink high-waisted super skinny
jeans there's the brand vgy
I would love to know the story behind
that name but they have an ear if I love
I really want to wear a light pink
sweatshirt with light pink pants so I
could just look like an Easter Egg I
don't know why I just do and these are
size 24 they fit fabulous these are so
fun and beachy
they're super skinny as well I got my
nice size 24 and they're from subdues
they're striped I don't know if you can
get these on their website anymore but
if you can i 100% by then they look good
with anything whether you're trying to
dress them up dress them down it was so
good
Topshop is some of my favorite style
jeans ever so I just picked up a plain
white pair I wear a size 26 in the Jaime
style and these have my wrist which I
love I think it's close water in the
legs and these are super skinny as well
so comfortable if you're looking for a
good pair of them I would say by Topshop
if you're looking for
a cheaper version go to north shamrock I
love all their jeans and their sale
section it's really nice I don't know if
these run super large my government
Urban Outfitters is a sale section I got
a size 24 they're probably they're DDGS
that have that little free registration
here which is that logo otherwise that's
PS PDG yes so there's just been amazing
long jeans or boyfriend jeans I really
don't know if I'm going to cut them yeah
and kind of make baggy shorts out of
them because they're just too big on me
to wear as denim jeans since I'm only
5'4 I really wanted these to work out I
love them so much so if you guys have
any ideas and how I should DIY then we
destroy them please comment down below a
lot of you guys if you wash around hull
before know that I shop at wasteland
sometimes which is a secondhand designer
store they have locations only in Los
Angeles or all in California I'm not
sure and I got this really cool western
style fringe jacket I don't know I'm
feeling about if I thought would look
great for dinner because I'm freezing
any time of the evening even if it's
summer I still need a jacket to wear out
and I think as leather Jack would just
be too heavy so I thought this is a
great alternative if I'm wearing white
pants or some cool denim pants I just
thought this is cute it's the brand
rehab and I rather synthesized media how
fun is this it kind of looks like a
Japanese or Chinese style shirt I don't
know if I have the right culture but I
love the yellow color it's so beautiful
all this embroidery artwork on it has a
dragon is just circling around it with a
bunch of cool colors I love that I got -
assess as well I got this before Nasty
Gal close down sorry they did not close
down boob awesome so now whose clothing
is on nasty elf domain the nasty all
still exist but the old maxi aisle is
not only in my heart I got this on doll
kill I've always just wanted a plain
simple white cropped sweater that you
could just throw over a bathing suit or
really cool bra less so this is perfect
it's the brand and read card I got - a
small and it has this Sutra in the back
you can tie it if you need to but it's
so holy and fun perfect for those really
hot steamy summer days
thank you guys so much for taking the
time to watch this video I love you all
so much I hope you have a beautiful day
don't forget to subscribe and give us a
thumbs up I love you guys
