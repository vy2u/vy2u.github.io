the product and then these are just for
looks but I love the silver hardware
here's the back zipper on how you slip
it on these shoes that I'm about to
share with you are the most beautiful
winter boot I've ever seen in my life
they're just so sleek and shiny and then
this is cool because it's kind of that
like foam look on the bottom and there's
platform really thick structured boots

I hold up on camera but I got mine in a
size extra small

gonna look amazing with high-waisted
leather pants perfect for the holidays
even a metallic skirt this two-piece set
is like nothing I've ever owned before I
really do love it it is from Urban

of the extra small so I got it in a size
small
it still looks amazing I love it don't
get me wrong so it just looks like this
these are from Urban Outfitters as well
the rips are so dope and then I love the
boot cut at the bottom I got - size 24
they just look like this I love that
jeans are now having to have all these
buttons and you button them up and then
here's what the boat looks like this
skirt is really cool it's a comfy denim
skirt it's not acid wash but it kind of
is I love that this this gunmetal color
or just like black denim I guess you
could say I got - extra small it's super
comfy looks really great with just a
t-shirt this is just a comfy t-shirt
from Urban Outfitters as well I got mine
in the size medium
it's a little bit crop so it looks
really good with high we said
anything like that high waisted denim if
you guys have washed my holes when
passing know how much I love t-shirts so
I got this one it's from Urban
Outfitters it's Stussy I'm obsessed it's
just I own this in green and black as
well I get - size medium I love wearing
this as a dress with like fishnet tights
and some cool boots with a leather
jacket it's so comfy so easy to throw
together I love this and I also got
another Suzi t-shirt and the back is so
cool again these are just from urban but
I'm sure you can get them on SUSE comm -
I love this it's pink with checkers on
the SUSE web site I picked up this I
believe it was in the men's section but
I swear all their clothes are unisex
which is so amazing and this is the
dopest sweatshirt I own now it's a size
medium it has a ribbed material and then
it's kind of like fuzzy like a towel
material that makes sense this is a
matching set that I go out on SUSE it's
perfect for winter I swear so it just
has the embroidered logo on there I got
the sweatshirt in a size small and it's
kind of a cropped look I would wear this
with high-waisted jeans or since it's a
matching set I got the matching
sweatpants they have pockets on the bum
and on the side which is amazing these
are size extra small I haven't worn them
yet you can tell and these are kind of
boot cut at the bottom I picked this up
at show me your muumuu I'm absolutely in
love with it it's fuzzy all over and it
is a super long I don't want to call it
a cardigan because do people wear
cardigans anymore I don't know I would
call this um just so long oversized
sweater but it's so comfy it's so
flattering with any look that's why I
love it so much for lovin lemons had a
sale on their website not so long ago so
I picked up some stuff online
this is probably one of my favorite
pieces that I got the size extra small
and has stars all over it's so delicate
so beautiful
perfect for spring I love that they had
it on the website paired with a tank top
and denim shorts and it's opened up with
sneakers I think that's so awesome you
can definitely wear it buttoned or
unbuttoned but you guys will be able to
see more of what it looks like in the
Triad portion it also comes with a
matching not a matching comes with a
slip dress underneath and this is kind
of a good tan color it just looks like
this it's just nice to have that's nice
it came with it but I got on super super
sale on for love and lemon as well I
also got this cheetah bodysuit I have
been wearing it a lot I really do love
it so flattering it fits me really good
I got my size extra small I'm 411 lemon
as well I got this silk red bodysuit
this is so beautiful it's gonna be great
for the holiday season or any events
that you go to if you go to events I
don't know but I love this I don't know
how else to explain it so I actually
have to wear it a different kind of way
if that makes sense you'll see it when I
try it on but it's too big on me in the
boobie area so what I do is I take one
of the straps I wrap it around and I
make it a really cool like sweetheart
neck you do what you got to do when it's
final sale and you can't return it I
recently have been obsessed with the
brand UNIF so I got these bomb yellow
and black pants they're kind of bootcut
at the bottom it was hard for me to find
what shoes to wear with these in the
beginning but I just wear sneakers I got
mine in a size 24 they fit me perfect
I also picked up this sweater from Yoona
five been wearing this a lot it's so
comfy holy cow obviously it's a
turtleneck as you can see it has awesome
stripes it's all ribbed it's so soft not
itchy at all I also picked up these
socks from Yoona and then they just say
unit right there I love socks I'm really
into socks showing when I wear like
sneakers and stuff I got some other
stuff on UNIF as well I know it's winter
but I can still wear skirts with like
oversized sweatshirts here so I got this
skirt from unify think it's just their
classic skirt that's on their website
- sighs extra small it has white stripes
like athletic stripes going down and
then it has a rubber unit logo which I
really like and I thought this looks so
cute with this unit t-shirt which is one
of those like vintage 90s cropped
looking tees I love this I got this one
in size extra small as well and it just
says unif on it with I think those these
are girls stretching or dancing
appropriately I couldn't tell you I love
layering stuff in the winter so that's
probably why I'm gonna show you guys
these I got these cute tank tops from
are you Am I they look really small but
once you put them on your body they
stretch out and they fit depending on
what size you get so this is just a
plain one shoulder and white tank which
I really love the other style I got is
just this plain black tank with a swoop
in the back these photographed really
great too if you're wondering I wanted
to pick up another cool just like jacket
to wear to college or class so this is
from dolls kill I love the coloring and
the color blocking of the black and
maroon or like just a deep purple I
don't know what material this is because
it's definitely not velvet or suede but
it's super soft and cozy it's kind of
thin line so it's definitely good to
layer way I've been really into red
lately so I got another red sweater I
love this it's from dolls kilt super
stretchy super cozy and it's totally
reasonably priced that's why I love it I
got mine in a size small and I've been
loving the one shoulder look lately a
lot of people are rocking it on social
media so of course and why don't you try
it out on dolls kill as well I got this
purple dress I think I was just feeling
spontaneous so I bought this purple
velvet dress this sleeves are kind of
cool kind of bell-bottoms it's not as
tight as you would think that's why I
love it so much um
turtleneck love turtlenecks this looks
so good on the model on their website so
I just had to get it I'm obsessed with
it these are from dolls kill how amazing
are these I bet you could just wear like
some black spandex with it
if you are trying to wear see-through
bottoms but I would just wear an
oversized sweatshirt with this kind of
make it a dress sweatshirt and have
these hang out like biker shorts at the
bottom and they would look really cool I
also have been really into cheetah
lately so revolve gifted me this I went
to an about them and they gifted me this
amazing cheetah two-piece it's super
shiny like it's wearing highlighter and
then here's what the bottoms look like I
got the bottoms in annex rector small I
love this it's so fun when I went to the
event I didn't see one other person
wearing this outfit which is cool and
here's just what the bustier top looks
like and then these are the heels that I
wore with the outfit they're from revolt
as well they're the raid brand they're
just gold metallic pumps or not pumps I
don't platforms platforms is the right
word and then I have two cozy oversized
sweatshirts that I can share with you
guys these are goals Briana and Jalen's
merch which I'm so happy for them I love
them there's such amazing people if you
aren't subscribed to Brianna white you
need to but she designed or I'm sure
they designed the clothing together it's
unisex which is really awesome and they
just have roses on the sides and their
brand is shot for more I love it so cute
things love thank you for sending me

other pieces but I'm just so obsessed
