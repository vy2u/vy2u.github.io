to be all about Instagram I'm so excited
I'm going to be showing you the apps I
use to edit my photos on Instagram plus
what I do what I do on those apps to
edit them and then my Instagram name is
Cali geyser you guys should go check it
out before you watch this video so you
could see my feet and everything but I
will show screenshots throughout here a
lot of people say that their instrument
seen on the way they edit their photos
and everything I honestly don't know if
I'm as a theme or not please let me know
I know in the wintertime I used the
effect transfer and the actual iPhone
camera that effect transfer I loved it
especially the flash it was my favorite
effect to use from like Halloween
probably too late last month but now
that it's spring I'm using Chrome or and
then when I edit my photos they just
leave it as Chrome so the absolute used
to edit my Instagram pictures is
facetune and visco the sco
um it is so popular right now a friend
actually introduced it to me Blair she
has actually edited more than a few of
my Instagram pictures that I have posted
because will be like texting him like
which photo she's like which photo
should I post on Instagram should
respond be like this one I Emma did it
for you and like her editing skills are
just out of this world so obviously I'm
gonna post it but you guys could check
out her Instagram she's really good at
editing Blair fund plai ar e UND super
cool we actually did a photo shoot
together not too long ago actually
edited some of those photos too but the
way I edit my photos is I use facetune
in visco and I know a lot of people are
against facetune because they think that
every person that uses it might alter
themselves and make themselves
unrealistically perfect or I don't even
know just unrealistic the way they're
looking real life I've definitely edited
my eyes with facetune I will swipe
detail grip but I mostly use facetune
for the background
there was this one photo that I took I
remember over winter break we were
skiing in Wisconsin and I was like
standing outside when it was blizzarding
blizzarding I don't even know if that's
a word whatever correct me and we were
getting Panda Express on our way home or
ship away I don't remember and I was
like take a picture me this is so cool
so I'm literally standing in the parking
lot like posing I don't even know and my
sister took it for me and the background
is heinous oh my gosh it is heinous and
I'm saying that word right now because
my friend grace she always says that
word heinous and now it's stuck into me
I don't even know but um I completely
took all the food trucks and treats
treats and like the McDonald's behind me
I don't even know what was back there
but I've learned it all out and made it
an entire white background and it looks
awesome it literally looks like I'm in
I'm in a snowstorm and you can't see
anything else behind me I will show a
clip of it and I'll clip a picture of it
right here so you guys could see the
before and after it's so funny and then
there was another time I was actually
shopping at Oak Brook in Illinois near
Chicago and I was standing in this
bedding of flowers and they're like oh
this is so cool you take this of you but
you see like Zara's behind me like
Sephora's behind me like ugly stores are
behind me and I'm just standing in this
bedding of flowers so I used facetune to
patch up the flowers and build them all
around myself it is hysterical oh my
gosh but um you guys will laugh when you
see it but yeah I use face mount face
too mostly for the backgrounds on my
photos or if I want to tone out
something if that makes sense and make
it a different color
I know I've worn like a sheer shirt
before and you can maybe like can't see
my bra line just I thought out no one
will ever know so I have an iPhone 5s
also this case is so cute I was so
excited to show you show you guys this
case it winks you guys see this it's so
cute um I got it from Nordstrom Kate
Spade I think it got out of sale not too
long ago as well so
good luck my Myint I guess so when I
open up this go you want to go into your
library if you need to add any photos
you just hit the plus sign but I already
have a photo in here that I'm going to
edit they have awesome awesome effects
in this I actually have spent probably
six dollars on some of the effects but
they have awesome black and white ones
some amazing colored ones and then I
know once I choose a color I'll usually
bring that down to five or six sometimes
seven but mostly anywhere from four to
six and then I'll go into the editing
folder and hit contrast I usually
contrast once depending on the photo of
course and then brightening I usually
don't I'll usually do one down for the
exposure and then for sharpness
sometimes I go up to seven if I'm
feeling reckless but usually not I don't
really do anything with saturation
because the photo usually is already
saturated enough with ever with with
whatever effect I was using but
sometimes I'll do highlight maybe one
and then for shadows maybe plus one who
knows depending on how the photo looks I
never usually fade my photos unless I'm
going for that but I like this pinky
shadows tint or the green one and then
you could always alter that and then put
it however you guys would like so when
you're finished you just click save to
camera roll and it saves and it shows
you the photo
boom pull up Instagram post it I think
this goes probably my favorite editing
out just because it makes the photo look
so professional even if it was taken on
an iPhone I just got back from Marco
Island and I edited all my photos with
visco I don't even think I touched base
to it but usually I'll go into Phase two
first fix the background how I would
like it go into visco do whatever I need
to do in there and then I'll put some
entry remote oh so yeah that's all I do
to edit my pictures
sometimes I'll crop it so that it's
squared I personally have not updated my
Instagram in so long I still have the
which so a lot of people ask me how I
edit my photos with the smeared effect
along the side I will show an example
right here so what I do for that is
nothing I don't use an app but there is
an app called glitch that you guys can
get GLI TCH II I believe if I'm wrong
I've only get down below in the
description box but for Instagram since
I have not updated it when I post a
photo it's just gonna be that old
looking interview whatever you guys have
now but if I take two fingers and zoom
out as much as I want or zoom in however
I would like it I just hit next while
holding my two fingers on the screen and
my Instagram will glitch and it gives me
that smear effect which I love
especially I thought I have a white
photo and I want the wall to continue
along it works out perfect
I do use after light sometimes and if I
do use after light it's only for putting
the white bars on an Instagram photo I
don't know how my theme is on Instagram
if you guys comment down below what you
think it is I would love that thank you
guys so much for taking the time to
watch this video it means so much to me
I hope you guys just have an awesome
week an awesome day or whatever time

questions about Instagram I might be
able to help you but we're basically
