gonna try and vlog probably the end of
December so from here on out till the
end of December which I'm really excited
about I'm home in Chicago for the
holidays and I couldn't be more excited
I am getting ready right now to go to a
family Christmas party sliding is really
weird though I need to start getting
dressed here is how insane my room looks
like right now
I haven't unpacked anyway stuff oh but I
did just get the cutest package ever
from the most beautiful humans so thank
you so much wildflower I love you guys
this is so bomb I put it on my phone
already how sick is this case no idea
what I'm wearing right now but it's the
Midwest so you can literally wear
whatever you want and it's so cold
I've just been wearing my huge fluffy
yellow jacket every single day and it's
so cozy and I love it
I haven't blogged in so long this is fun
oh I got the sickest new shoes look at
these shoes look look at these new shoes
I got there so beautiful there are
Nordstrom they have any brighter rows
right here and I'm obsessed so I'm gonna
get dressed and then I'll blog all of my
family to my dad's side of the family so
I'm really excited to see everyone and I
miss everyone so yeah ok this is what I
decided to wear my sweater is from for
loving lemons about I think there are
season two years ago not their season
their collection and then I immediately
wear these pants all the time there's a
spell bottom oh boy
are you scooter in my cousins have a
make a ring in their backyard good
morning guys I was able to wake up a
little bit earlier today I have a really
exciting photoshoot in the city and it
should take me about an hour to drive
down there I don't have a ton of time
but since I woke up earlier I showered
I'm clean I stopped to do my hair and
makeup and I'm eating breakfast in my
bed right now so I'm eating this
blueberry protein bar from our ex bar
and I just want to say thank you so so
much to our X bar for sponsoring this
video if you guys have or have not heard
of our X bar before basically they're so
amazing
our X bar is a whole food protein bar
and they are made with 100% whole
ingredients and on their label you guys
can see the core ingredients which is
egg whites almonds cashews dates and
then I love how on their label it says
no BS what's also really nice about
these protein bars is they have no glue
in no soy and no dairy which is amazing
because anyone can eat them then my
absolute favorite flavor is the peanut
butter chocolate one these protein bars
got me through finals week so they were
nice enough before we are collaborating
on this video they sent me a box of them
and my roommate and I went through more
than half the box because when you're a
college kid you don't have time to wake
up every morning and make yourself
breakfast honestly that's just how it is
so these protein bars saved my life I
was able to get full get protein in me
during finals week which I love so since
they were sent to my apartment LA I only
have the flavors that my mom keeps in
the pantry downstairs so here are the
flavors that I haven't
me I have not tried the maple sea salt
or the mich off it so I'm really excited
try these but I honestly can't choose
these two are my absolute favorite
flavors this one's the chocolate sea
salt and the peanut butter chocolate and
then this is what the blueberry one
looks like it's so good I'm eating it
for breakfast right now as you guys can
see their main source of protein is
coming from these egg whites and that's
so awesome because it's really easy for
our body to absorb depending on whether
you guys like sweet or savory flavors
like chocolate or fruit there's
definitely an Rx bar for you because
they have 11 delicious flavor varieties
which I'm obsessed with and then there's
also no sugar added in these I'm the
type of person that just loves to take a
protein bar and throw it in her purse
that's why I think these are so amazing
and I definitely think you guys should
try them out I'm in love with them my
mom's in love with them my favorite
things about these bars is that when you
eat them the real ingredients actually
taste so good like this one has dates
cashews almonds and egg whites and then
the chocolate sea salt in this one you
can actually taste the sea sole and it's
so good but yeah I just love how easy
these are to throw in my purse throw in
my backpack there's a show you eat and
they're so good they fill me up
these two are my absolute favorite ones
I can't choose between them and then the
blueberry is definitely a really yummy
one too when I'm feeling more of a
breakfast on the go type a moment so
that's why I mean the blueberry one
right now but if you guys want to try
out any of these it's so awesome
our x-bar is going to be giving you guys
25% off your first order and you could
just visit our x-bar column slash Callie

my breakfast and then I'm gonna do my
makeup do my hair and then I'll probably
leave for the city in like 30 minutes 30
or 40 minutes cuz that's about all the
time that I have I'm definitely gonna
vlog the photo shoot and I can't wait
for you guys to see everything
