beyond excited to share with you guys
this amazing brand called I agree ll you
probably have either heard of it because
you've seen people wearing shirts like
this or I know they have some cute
pocketed ones as well but I'm wearing
this cute fitting evil eye team which I
absolutely adore I normally don't wear
yellow either but I am right now and
then they have accessories online as
well so this brand is so amazing you
probably follow them on some of their
social media platforms they have a
facebook Instagram and a Twitter I know
for the Twitter it's at shop ivory Ella
and then for Instagram Facebook it's
just ivory Ella or at ivory Ella
but what's so amazing is this is a they
make good clothes for good cause I
believe that is they're saying something
like that something amazing like that
and then um not only do you like look
cute in their clothes but you're also
helping saving elephants at the same
time I love good causes I love
everything that they have done so far I
think they have really grown and
expanded from like so much social media
and everything I've seen people walk
around my town wearing these shirts and
I think it's so cool they donate ten
percent of net profits to save the
elephants org which is so cool because
elephants are the most beautiful
creatures there's some delicate and
elegant and I love everything about them
but I can't wait to share with you guys
so war of their amazing shirts that they
sell and then um so accessories as well
so right now I'm wearing this like super
cute ivory Ella um
uit the elephants like this it's more
fitted but I absolutely adore it I
normally
we're yellow and I love this color so I
have this really cute neon coral Paisley
tank which I cannot wait to wear on the
beach because I'm going to Nantucket
this week and I could not be more
excited I know so many people have
posted on Instagram and like tagging
ivory Ella and everything and I know
there's like super cool photos and like
a bunch of these shirts so I'm probably
gonna go check those out in just a few
minutes and you guys should too but I
also got this white classic print in the
long-sleeve and it is a pocket of
Rockets whatever people call these I
absolutely adore them I don't know if
you guys own anything from Comfort
colors I believe that's where ivory I
love prints their clothes on because
their tags are Comfort colors and all of
my shots are size small but oh my gosh
the material of this cotton is so
comfortable it's insane and then this
one is that seafoam Aztec print which I
absolutely dorset and muted like mustard
orange I'm not very good with naming
colors but I absolutely adore this with
the Aztec design and then says ivory
Ella and then the front is the pocket as
well and then this one is so cute I
think it's the seafoam blue or sky blue
or something but its essence the hand
inside the elephant I love that they
have an array of different designs like
captain side the elephant like this one
is Evo eye and then this is the hamsa
hand Aztec and then this is like Paisley
Paisley the neon coral Paisley tank yes
I love all that and then this one of
course just says right in the middle
which
so super sick but yeah I love all of
these shirts and then they also sell
accessories and fill cases online as
well and they do sell men's shirts as
well
but I have one of their chokers with me
it is the antique silver it's the
antique silver one and I absolutely
adore I am obsessed with chokers I wear
them almost every day of summer and I
read them in winter two chokers aren't
going to go ourselves for a while and I
know they like everyone's wearing
chokers now so I think this is a great
trend and this is so cute because that's
just something elephant I love elephants
elephants and giraffes are my favorite
animals
so I love everything that this brand is
done for elephants and I support them a
hundred percent but I thank you guys so
much for you turn to watch this video I
really hope you enjoyed it and I hope
