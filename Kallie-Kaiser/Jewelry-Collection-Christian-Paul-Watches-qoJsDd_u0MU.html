jewelry collection just some of my
favorites that I wear also in this video
I will be reviewing my favorite watch
company which is amazing they're
Australian and in his Christian Paul
watches I've had the opportunity to
collaborate them on Instagram before
about 7 months ago and now I have the
opportunity to collab with them on
YouTube and I have an entire collection
of 43 millimeter watches to share with
you guys and I really really can not be
more excited and then I have a bunch of
cute layering necklaces this video won't
really show a lot of bracelets except
for this one and earrings just because I
don't really wear bracelets or earrings
my wrists are really small so it's hard
to find bracelets that I love so much
and wear all the time
but without further ado let's go so we
are going to be talking about layering
necklaces first I own a few from brandy
melville this is a lorac lariat Lyrid
how do you say it I don't know so it's
just this brainy Melville gold
simple delicate lariat necklace I don't
know how you say that word I love
layering this with this brandy melville
necklace this combo is super inexpensive
and it kind of looks expensive when you
wear it together maybe on the beach and
a bikini or if you're taking photos this
just has white little crystals on it and
it's gold as well they just look really
really cute layered together I love them
a lot so here I have two different
layering necklaces that are kind of the
same just different gold color this one
is more tarnished this one is from Urban
Outfitters it kind of has a circle
Bonaire and then like another circle
right there this one is from Stella and
Dot as we can see the three different
tiers are just super fun different
colors this is silver and gold together
I love this one it's like just fun to
play with if you're wearing it but yeah
these are just great necklaces to wear
with low-cut shirts which I love wearing
low-cut shirts not for any particular
reason I just like the way they look on
the body and then yeah it's hard to find
affordable layered necklaces so Urban
has really good ones and then still n
dot is a little more expensive but they
have higher quality ones too you guys
might have seen me talk about glue clasp
in a video before I just own this horn
choker and I knew
in this necklace in every single video
of my channel so far I got an animal a
clasp about when everyone was filing for
their tax returns so probably January I
love it so much it's the horn choker
Lily clasp was kind of an expensive
brand but they are the most beautiful
brand ever they're my favorite jewelry
brand
aside from probably getting just like
fine jewelry at urban and then this one
is from Anthropologie with just a bunch
of cool assholes in it honestly this
looks so sick on especially if you wear
it tighter up on the neck and it's like
super cute I love the way this
complements my skin tone and the color
of the gold is so pretty so here are all
six watches that I have to share with
you guys I can't hold them all it's
really nice to know that a company has
grown from the past 7 months when I
received this watch
the leather is a smoother finish and cut
the marble is even cuter and more
defiant I love the way this Rose is not
going to tarnish as this it's more of a
shiny instead of a matte finish
I cannot rave enough about these watches
I can't make share with you guys there
are some Styles they have a great
collection a classic collection and
marble collection and a luxe collection
and here is what some of the luxe look
like here is what the luxe look like
they just have these really nice crystal
rectangles in the middle of the
stainless steel casing which is also
water resistant it's also really hard to
find a wash brand that's going to fit
around your wrist because I have super
super super small wrists and I think
their circumference of theirs is 14 to
20 which is amazing so yeah here is what
some of the watches look like this one
is all matte black which marble in the
middle just one is from a great
collection obviously I love the white
panels and let's say you want to wear
just black leather on this grey one
guess what you just pull this back
switch it out and you just put a black
one on here so you can order straps if
you don't know more than one of their
watches here are all the rest of the
watches and
to show you guys the two Greek election
ones that I have so these are both from
the Greek collection what are really
nice about all of these watches there
are all unisex doesn't matter they don't
have gender to them which is so awesome
a guy could wear this girl girl wear
this and make it both rockets so good
here is from their grid collection it's
just an all white I believe this is gold
or it's rose gold love how sleek this is
this looks amazing
on here is this gorgeous Marla watch
obviously this is from their marble
collection it is rose gold around the
head and the steel case of the watch and
then this is like a light pink peach
color I love this watch is definitely
one of my favorites so here is this
black marble one it is amazing I could
switch out the straps to any color if I
wanted to but obviously I love the whole
sleek black look here is a brown leather
from the grid collection the middle it's
just made with super cool white panels I
love the way this looks on the wrist
this one is awesome I believe it is from
the lux collection I love the way this
looks with the gold and the brown
leather I love that
here is another all-black watch I think
this is from the luxe collection as well
huge shot so Christian Hall watches they
are an Austrian brand I love everything
that they stand for and I love as you
guys can see like look at that shine and
then the leather is just so nice they
come in these beautiful cases that's a
christian paul across in a really nice
leather they just open like this and
they're storing here I know he has um an
authenticity that comes when you order a
wash yeah I hope you guys give them some
love I will link them down below in the
description box so lately everyone has
been wearing these black leather chokers
so in love the way they look with any
type of shirt low-cut high rise
turtleneck you can rock it with any
shirt literally my sister actually makes
them I just took these from her room she
has like 50 just laid out I would love
if you guys went on her Etsy it's love
and leather she sells them on Etsy and
they're only $20 most people sell them
for 35 to 45 dollars which is crazy
expensive and hers only $20 which is
super affordable I love
charm she has rose gold silver and then
like a bronzy gold and then a gunmetal
color that make sense she makes them in
ten and black some of them even has bars
up on the top near the choker before you
tie and let it hang it's so cute
so ya go to her sen show her some love
it would mean so much to me honestly
her company mane is love and leather and
i will be the link down below
description box so many of you guys
asked me about my rings i just wanna let
you know i've acquired these around the
past five years in my life maybe maybe
six so i started to want to wear
stainless steel rings but I never wanted
to pay over fifteen dollars for one so
this one is that Cartier design I got
this on Amazon I honestly cannot afford
a Cartier ring so I just wanted the look
of it I love look of it so I bought this
from an Amazon and it was like twenty
bucks and then this skull ring is one of
my favorites and it's just from one of
my favorite places Door County Wisconsin
and I used to go there every single year
we just haven't gone this past year
because we're both in college and I got
that a small jewelry store um just like
downtown area and these two faith and
peace ones are from young life store um
young life has great rings and I love
them because they're not expensive and
they're stainless steel and then the
rest are just from random flea markets
and stuff but yeah that's about it just
try and find not expensive stainless
steel rings and you can have them on
your fingers forever thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch this video
I really hope you enjoyed it I will
leave a link down below in the
description box for most of the jewelry
if I can find it online but obviously I
will link down below christian paul
watches a lot of christian paul watches

can't wait to wear all of these sick
watches and my friends were not my
sisters or my parents um yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
