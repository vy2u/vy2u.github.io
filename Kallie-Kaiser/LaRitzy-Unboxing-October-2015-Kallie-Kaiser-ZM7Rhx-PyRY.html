next thing is this daily protection
deodorant detox deodorant perfectly
unscented on one hundred percent natural
and nourishing finally a natural
deodorant that is safe and effective ok
I hate certain smells of deodorant so
this is very exciting for me I like I'm
scented everything like I'm scented
lotion i'm pretty picky person when it
comes to sense so I'm all about this and
this is called Zach detox deodorant I
will use that I will use that ok here we
have two small bottles they're both body
washes and they're from that same
perfume company the strange invisible
perfumes this is lavender and vetiver
okay I'm all about lavender lavender is
one of my favorite scents and then this
is sage and rose ah alright okay this
one smells really good too I just love
the smell of lavender I can't wait to
use these okay and then here is a juice
beauty organic solution green apple age
defy hand cream I am from Chicago my
hands get so dry in the winter time so
this is so nice to have this is
certified organic as well um I have very
sensitive skin so on any organic
products i'm all about and also i'm
living the desert right now because i
attend the University of Arizona so this
is very
exciting I can't sell it yet I'm just
sorting some of my hands we could try it
oh I love this okay it's a very very
subtle scent which I love and it dropped
like it soaks into your skin right away
which is really nice okay last thing in

think this shows everything that we got
I will leave um my co down below in
description box it's Cal 25 and you can
get twenty-five percent off your first
month's box and every month you would
pay 2499 um I am I really like I'm so
impressed and look how cute the boxes
and everything seems like it's full size
except for the sample perfume and then
the body washes and the body washes
which is really nice because in a lot of
boxes you'll pay a lot of money and then
you don't get a lot of full sized items
so I think this is great um this is
probably my favorite thing and this I'll
definitely use this deodorant backup
deodorant is the best especially because
I'm a college student so back up
