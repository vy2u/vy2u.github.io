I'm just gonna be sharing with you guys
life updates and new experiences that's
just been happening lately so here we go
first dramatic change in my life right
now I'm now in college I moved from
Illinois to Arizona so now I live in
Tucson Arizona and I am attending the
University of Arizona and it's so I love
it so much every morning I like wake up
to this huge window where I'm filling in
front I'm on top of my bed yeah so I
live in a dormitory dormitory dorms now
and there's I've two roommates so we're
a triple and I love them so much but I
don't know if you guys ever want to see
like a room tour or like a dorm room
tour a type thing you guys would meet my
roommates in that of course but
absolutely adore them I love my entire
Hall every morning I wake up to the
mountains outside my window and palm
trees and the Sun and I love it so much
I cannot believe how gorgeous is here
but the one thing is it's like 107
degrees every single day so if you're
standing outside for 30 minutes in
direct sunlight I've already been here
for four weeks as well and I'm so pale I
don't I don't understand I don't think I
get tan and I'm even laid out at the rec
center pool we have a lap pool outside
oh and if you guys want my snapchat it's
just Callie and I don't know if you guys
want to like see me here in Arizona it's
so weird to like live in a different
climate right now I'm also mirror-like
my dorm is right near food place with a
really good salad bar which is awesome
and I don't know if anyone has heard of
bagel talk it is so good it might even
beat Einstein bagels if you know what
that is second thing I am now in a
sorority I did do recruitment and I love
it so far you just have to wait to be
initiated but there's so much fun events
going on and that's how you meet so many
different people I think there's like a
hundred and seven girls in my pledge
class right now I believe I could be
wrong I've never been born yet I'm not
very homesick because there's something
always going on
my schedules pretty good I do have a M's
every Monday Wednesday and Friday which
stinks but you can't do anything about
there's literally something always going
on it's so fun
there's pool parties on the weekends
it's so fun people wear bathing suits
and sometimes there isn't even a pool at
the pool party but it doesn't matter
because it's so hot here in the desert
and right now it's monsoon season so
just randomly rains almost every day I
believe I don't think it rained
yesterday the day before but it will
just like clouds and then downpour and
then it's done and the it dries so fast
it's the weirdest thing I'm not used to
it third thing is I'm now 19 so I'm very
old if that is considered old I feel
very old I turned 19 August 13th and I
wish I was younger I don't know what I'm
gonna be filming videos and then having
time to edit it because I'm gonna try
and do YouTube in school at the same
time so like and also have a social life
obviously but it's kind of like hard to
balance everything so if I don't upload
one video a week I'm so sorry
um I mean of course I'm gonna try my
hardest to do that but it is gonna be
really hard depending on how much
homework I have and stuff thank you guys
so much for taking the time to watch
this random video I don't know if you
enjoyed it or not let me know down below
in the comments then be great and then
just if you want you could subscribe to
my youtube channel if you haven't
already and give this video a thumbs up
also my snapchat is at Cali and and my
Twitter and Instagram links will be down
below in the description box but it's
just at Cali Kaiser for both social
medias and I hope you guys have an
awesome day I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
