hey it is Cal we are filming my morning
routine today this is definitely gonna
be an updated version so I'm excited to
update you guys in my life but first
thing I do in the morning once I wake up
is reach my phone doesn't everybody and
I'm just checking on my socials snapchat
Instagram YouTube I reply to all of your
guys amazing comments I love you guys
you're the best I also check on
everybody's Instagram stories I love
Instagram stories especially the new
gifs that you can add to the screen I
think they're the cutest things ever
normally after I checked my phone and we
just wake up I'll lay in my bed for
about 20 minutes to an hours depending
on my day I actually just ended school
so I'm really excited that it's now
summer and I can kind of chill out more
and definitely relax school stressful we
all know that I recently just got my
nails done I'm still obsessed with
sparkly glitter nails
I just can't sneak away from my
obsession after I kind of just have been
on my phone for a while hanging out in
my bed I'll finally get up and then make
my bed a little bit is what you guys are
seeing here and then I'll walk straight
into my bathroom kind of figure out what
my skin situation is and what kind of
products I'm going to be using today so
first thing I do is brush my hair and
then I'm going to brush my teeth
and then obviously put on my bathrobe
for our face wash today we are using
this chanel foaming cleanser I got sent
Nordstrom I love this product because it
actually removes all the makeup on your
face and I feel like a lot of cleansers
don't do that sometimes so I don't have
to use makeup remover before with this
cleanser gonna I love it I just use that
every single day using the centerpiece
of my skincare routine I'm going to be
taking my EOS aqua hydrate skin prep I
love this product it's a part of iOS's
new aqua collection and these yost aqua
products cover us all in essential
hydration and they feature sustainably
sourced sea scallop and Irish moss which
are actually two of nature's most
versatile and hydrating marine
botanicals so this product works triple
duty as a toner serum and moisturizer
all in one so as you guys see me swatch
it on my hand right now you can see how
it kind of goes on like a cream and
instantly transforms into a soft water
like texture it keeps my skin super
hydrated and fresh what I love most
about this is it literally saves a lot
of time in my beauty routine because
it's basically three and one and with
the aqua hydrating skin prep it's a
great primer because it keeps my skin
glowing and fresh underneath my makeup
so we are taking our it cosmetics by by
redness this is just kind of like a
pressed powder foundation vibe I love
this I'm just using my morphe fluffy
brush it definitely takes away redness
all over my face then I'm going in with
my cosmetics bye bye pores bronzer I
love love this shade it's so warm and
really nice for the summer I was test
with it and I love it it's poreless and
then for our blush I'm taking this NARS
narcissus cheeks one in palette and I'm
kind of using this pinky purple shade
just putting that on the apples of my
cheeks and then I'm also going to be
using the NARS Capri highlighter putting
that just in the regular places on my
face for our eyebrows I'm using the Too
Faced browny eyebrow pencil I love this
it smells amazing it works amazing I
kind of just feather those into my
eyebrows and then brush it up with a
spoolie at the end and then for lips I'm
using
the eos aqua hydrating lip treatment oh
my gosh I'm obsessed with this - it is
so moisturizing I mean you guys can see
I'm using my vlog camera to kind of zoom
in on my makeup here moving on to our
hair section I'm going to be taking this
amazing dry shampoo by Playa I love this
stuff it's so great I just spray that on
areas where my hair either kind of looks
like it's gonna be getting a little
crazy or already is after the bathroom
I'm going straight into my closet to get
dressed for the day I normally take like
10 minutes to get dressed just because
I'm an indecisive person so these shorts
are unreal there from redone denim I
absolutely am in love with them I'm just
gonna pay that with some socks these
black boots and oversized sweatshirt as
always this one's from shadow Hill USA
and then you guys always ask me about my
rings the boss ring is from pretty
connected most of the nicer rings are
gonna be from Poshmark
I bought them used off of people and
they were so much cheaper earrings are
from melody asani here's just what my
outfit looks like as I creepily vlog
myself in the camera I didn't even look
at the weather for today but it's been
kind of cold in LA so I haven't been
really having the best time finding
something to wear but after I get
dressed I usually just head straight to
the kitchen because I'm starving
I'm so hungry I always eat right when I
wake up and I chug water as well but I
just was too lazy to videotape myself
drinking water oh my gosh these bonbons
from Trader Joe's are the best dessert
ever you guys have to try them if you
live near Trader Joe's okay pantry I
decided to just make one of my favorite
og breakfast --is so that is just bread
with peanut butter on the top and
bananas so I'm just going to toast my
bread in the toaster I feel like you
guys haven't really seen a good view of
my apartment I definitely still want to
film an apartment tour before I move out
of here at the end of July but yeah I'll
show you guys a little bit right now so
this is a blow-up chair from Urban
Outfitters we were gonna get our TV
mounted but we never
I'm doing it here's a little couch area
and over here is our kitchen and then
once my bread is somewhat ready I decide
to cut up my bananas I usually just use
one whole banana to put on top of the
peanut butter on top of the bread if you
guys are wondering where I get groceries
I get all my groceries at Trader Joe's I
feel like I saved so much more money at
Trader Joe's than Whole Foods I love
drinking juices in the morning so I just
grabbed a juice cup from the cabinet and
I'm drinking watermelon juice I did get
this one at Whole Foods there orange
juice is highly recommended that one's
my favorite over this one this was my
first time trying the watermelon juice
it's really good I have to take hate
into the airport now I mean I haven't
even just like blogged or walked around
the camera I'm so long so much shorter
than you it's crazy you're a whole head
after that depending on what I'm going
to be doing for the day I'll either play
Fortnight Mama's are the best go out
shopping his friends go get food since
I'm finally out of school in this summer
um I feel like I was trapped by school
for the whole school year but yeah we
are now back in my apartment because I
just videotaped my self pretending to
leave I didn't actually leave thank you
guys so much for taking the time to
watch this video I hope you loved it

below and have an amazing day bye I love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
