I'm going to be trying to vlog me moving
into my new apartment in LA I am so
beyond excited I'm not living right in
downtown LA I'm more near Santa Monica
I'm so beyond excited never lived near
the beach before I'm going to try and
vlog this is my second vlog ever I
believe but yeah I'm also going to be
showing you guys when I'm wearing
everyday everything is going to be from
misguided in this video
shout to misguided I love you guys so
much because of them I will be wearing
only misguided in this video and it's
gonna be awesome so obviously right now
I am wearing misguided this is the comfy
sure ever I've been wearing it for the
past two days because we drove this car
from Tucson I had to pick up all my dorm
stuff at U of a and I saw all my friends
there from last year and it was so
amazing
we drove seven hours straight to LA
unpacked my stuff at around 9 p.m. into
my apartment and then we've just been
going to home goods Costco all that kind
of stuff trying to get my apartment
moved in and I also just wanted to share
with you guys my outfits that I've been
wearing because so many of you guys are
interested in my style and I thought oh
my gosh misguided has my style and so
many of you guys want me to do a haul
about missguided it's all deadly have to
show you guys what I have from them and
I will tell you all of the sizing
because a lot of you guys are curious
about the sizes I was just at the beach
I have my suit on right now and I was
just passed out in the sand I also just
popped a zip right on my face you guys
might be able to see it and then this
t-shirt is just the most comfortable
thing ever I'm obsessed with it and I
got this in a size 2 but here we go
ok guys we finally made it to the
apartment I love everything but I'm not
showing you anything yet just because I
am going to be doing an apartment tour
soon and I want everything to look super
cool in the video but we just unloaded
the car and here is everything when
loaded we kind of set it up a bit I have
my lamp on already just because there
isn't a light here yet and then
also wanted to talk to you guys about
misguided because I'm going to be
wearing misguided throughout this entire
video as I try and vlog moving in I bet
there won't be a lot of moving in shots
just because I can't carry a camera and
carry stuff same time but all my outfits
in this video are misguided like I said
in the intro and I believe they are
strangling a uk-based I love misguided I
used to shop on there for my homecoming
shoes my homecoming dresses when I was
in high school and it was so awesome but
for my outfit today I was driving the
car so for my backpack it's faux leather
it's all white I feel like if you live
somewhere warm this could totally be a
first day school outfit I don't know I
could be wrong my body suit I got it in
a size 4 it's super cool because it has
red and white stripes and then there's a
bit of brown and yellows in there as
well one of you guys can see and so many
of you guys asked what bra let's or bras
I wear with body suits I just don't wear
a bra with it it has enough support for
me and then these are just cute black
ripped denim shorts I got these insights
too sometimes their sizes can be tricky
with the bottoms because I own another
pair of shorts and I got this in a size
zero but I'm obsessed with these these
rips are really cute and these fit
really nice I love when there is a bit
of a bagginess
and it's more of a boyfriend style oh i
uncashed my closet so I'll give you guys
a sneak peek about that so far
this is what we're working with right
now as you guys can see I have some bins
down there I put all my shoes over there
everything's just kind of disorganized
um but I can't wait to update you guys
on the rest of this video and I'm going
to go to bed because it is 11:00 p.m.
and I love you guys oh here my shoes I
got these in size 6 they're super fun
but the design on the shoes are
snakeskin with a bit of a silver glow to
it I love it so much if you guys can see
that I dig it
yeah I totally would wear this on the
first day school maybe with a bralette
under it because it could be kind of
revealing right now my mom and I are
just staying in because
do not have a mattress in my apartment I
just woke up I'm still in my pajamas I'm
just wearing this Guns and Roses shirts
from misguided I'm obsessed I also don't
have anything going on here and I
haven't brushed my teeth yet today but
you guys have to see how cute this
apartment is not apartment it's an inn
here's the bed so cozy and the bathroom
is so aesthetically pleasing I was in
love with it
as you guys can see and then we walk
through here it's kind of like a living
room area with couches and everything I
love it you guys okay so updates I mean
my apartment that I'm moving into but
I'm not going to share with you guys
because I am going to be doing an
apartment tour and the apartment isn't
ready at all I'll give you a sneak peek
at what my room is looking like right
now my mom and I are gonna go run to
Target right now and I think West Elm
and then a few other places here is my
outfit today it's kind of chilly out
today so I'm wearing a bomber jacket
with this all-white outfit the bombers
from misguided this short I'm misguided
I got these in a size zero they're super
cute I love them so much and then the
top is so cute because it dips down at
Abby and then it has that choker look
and then I just tied it I just thought
this bomber looked good with all white I
love the colors in it also you might
think that this is really thick but it's
actually really thin for being a silk
bomber jacket I don't know if you guys
can see it better in here whoa these
lights are automatic hey guys it's Cal
and I'm in the car with my mom you know
okay we are on our way to go get some
acai bowls right now at full of heaven

stuff to do today this I would consider
this actually day two of moving in just
because day one we only went to Target
but we really didn't get that much stuff
we ordered a lot of stuff online for
IKEA for my room but you guys aren't
gonna be seeing my room until it's
