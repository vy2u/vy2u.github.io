I'm going to be bringing you everything
I have experienced so far at college I
am at the University of Arizona in
Tucson Arizona I have a freshman and I'm
studying be a theater arts emphasis on
acting and if you guys want to follow me
through my college experience you can
follow me on my snapchat which is Callie
and and my Instagram is at Kelly Kaiser
I post on my Instagram at least once a
day and then on my snapchat I'm
constantly posting videos and pictures
relating to my life here at the
University of Arizona but self promo I
haven't wanted to make a three-part
video series on my channel for at least
the past six months but I didn't know
the perfect theme to do over a three
course video series so I'm finally so
excited just because this is so
requested and I'm going to be uploading
at least three maybe just to at least
two videos relating to college so this
video is going to be me sharing my
personal experience with you guys and
the next video is going to be my dorm
room tour I'm so excited to share my
living space with you even though it's
just a cubicle but I remember when I was
going um away to college as a freshman I
constantly lift up dorm room tours on
YouTube and stuff like that because it's
fun to get ideas like that so yeah I
will be uploading that within the next
two and a half two weeks but without
further ado I'd love to get in this
video so here we go so to start off to
talk about the topic of college um for
you as an individual and the lifestyle
you live just from me communicating with
other students and just being surrounded
by all my peers here at the University
of Arizona College is either going to be
the best thing that's ever happened to
you or the worst thing that's ever
happened to you I know that sounds
really terrifying but it's true because
when I first came here yeah my sister
goes to school here I film in her room
this is
wearing my YouTube videos she lives a
little bit off-campus and I stopped
filming my dorm because the quality of
me filming in my dorm isn't as good as
this setup and like her dresser and
stuff in the background but yeah so to
go back to the topic when I first came
here yeah I'm new five or six people
that maybe graduated with me and I knew
my sister and her friends from when I
visited unit University of Arizona in
the past and before knowing I was going
here but you against those five people
that you might know and then forty
thousand other students you're never
going to see those five people so if you
ever have the experience where oh I
don't want to go to that College because
everyone from my high school is going
there the chances have you seen those
people unless it's like a small five
thousand five thousand student private
school the chances of you seeing them is
when I first came to Arizona I loved it
so much the first three weeks were
amazing to me I was like so absorbed in
this bubble of oh my gosh I'm in a
sorority I love life like I want to go
out with my friends all the time blah
and then that kind of fell away and I
didn't really want go out a lot and for
semester like I would go out once a week
which is fine like you are allowed to go
out in college who cares like don't let
anyone judge you if you want to go out
or anything like that because I have a
very healthy lifestyle and I go out
sometimes I have fun with my best
friends like when I go out I need
probably nine new people every time and
then I pass them on the college campus
I'm like hey hey what's that above us
and then like you might even go out with
them next week you know it's just so fun
the connections you can make here to go
back to what I was saying is yeah I
ended up saying that I hated you of a I
felt like Tucson had nothing for me I
was trapped in this atmospheric bubble
where I wasn't grown
the way I wanted to be and I was just
super super stressed and you know being
at this university your freshman year
your first semester of your freshman
year you will know exactly what you want
in life and it's amazing just clicks I'm
not saying what you want to do in life
but you want you know exactly what you
want to college what you don't want to
college the people you want to surround
yourself with the people you don't even
want to be with you know stuff like that
which is really really cool but after
your first semester I decided that I'm
going to transfer I'm going to be
transferring to LA and we'll be there
next fall in 2016 oh my god I'm
literally so excited but this semester I
come back to the U of A and I love it
because I'm not an irregular anymore and
what's so cool is that um you can love a
place so much and you can love the
people here so much and I know that when
I leave I'll be so sad to leave here
because it's so cool you will literally
find yourself you know your first
semester of your freshman year um but
yeah I'm actually going to be
transferring and I'm so excited I'm
going to be living in LA next year and
going to school there it's literally
what is best for me right now in my life
I don't want to have to leave you of a I
actually love it so much and I have met
some of the greatest people I've ever
known here but I have to leave for the
way that I want to grow and the
opportunities that I want to experience
through stuff like this and Instagram
and I'm going to be my full creative
self I can't be trapped here in Tucson
any longer going to a school where you
don't know a lot of people can be very
terrifying and I don't know I don't
consider myself shy or introverted I'm
pretty much an extrovert and I can carry
on a conversation with anyone
whenever I mean I could be super awkward
sometimes but okay even though that can
be so scary there's something so special
in that because you get to start over
you don't know anyone else's past it's
crazy because my best friend
here I honestly don't know their past
unless they've told me stories or
experiences from high school but other
than that you really just get to start
over and you get a fresh start and it's
so refreshing so when I first got to
school before school even started rush
was going on it was like the first week
before school and it was one of the
hardest weeks I've ever ever went
through recruitment is so cool but at
the same like the amount of people you
meet is insane
the girls I talk I've never talked to so
many girls in my entire life you can
either go through recruitment it can be
super fake or super real it depends what
house you are talking to and the girl
you're talking to in that house usually
they're trying to match your energy when
you're talking to them so you'll walk
into a house talk to them for 30 minutes
and then four girls will come up stood
in that time of 30 minutes and you
switch and you just repeat the same
questions over and over again I got so
sick and my throat like I didn't have a
voice I was talking to girls as I yeah
I'm from Chicago
Lulla like it was just so bad after I
went through rush and that crazy week of
eight-hour days talking to girls every
single day and like trying to look your
best was crazy Beth the end it was
honestly so worth it um I'm actually an
alpha P here PC 15 it's a great time I
met some of my best friends in sorority
life um I don't have any opinions if you
aren't a sorority person or you aren't
in Greek life there's nothing wrong with
that many people have actually commented
on my videos like oh you're sorority
girl like would you even be friends with
someone who's not in a sorority of
course it doesn't matter ever it's
really hard to balance school and you my
like what I love so much YouTube and you
can just Instagram life like I love
collaborate with ographers and stuff and
it's really hard to incorporate that
with school and then like try and get my
studies priority and then you also have
a sorority chapter that you are part of
and that's literally a part-time job I
would just say like you literally have
to have the
best time management first semester I
really didn't have the best time
management I was like writing papers at
midnight when they were due at 8:00 a.m.
but now I'm finally like on top of my
schedule and I know um what I need to do
to get in the class and what I need to
do to get a B in the class you know
stuff like that also I love the
communication here on campus I literally
meet three new people a day it's insane
you literally meet three new people a
day to talk about college parties and
Greek life and you could still have an
amazing party life without being in a
sorority or fraternity without a doubt I
know it's harder for guys because guys
can't be let into fraternities if you're
not a guy in that but girls can walk in
to any house any satellite house any
like off-campus house which is a
satellite house but yeah first semester
I never really went out my friends would
come up I'm like no I really don't want
to go out but now I started you got more
and I've learned that it's fine to go
out and party and have fun like there's
nothing wrong with that
and before people comment say like oh
like school isn't about partying or this
you like I pay out-of-state tuition here
the University of Arizona that is so
expensive
you literally pay for this lifestyle so
I'm going to live that lifestyle and I'm
going to live it to what I want to live
it by and I'm honestly so appreciative
to go here I'm not saying that I'm not
obviously studies are priority and I
know that I'm paying for those classes
and all of the knowledge I'm obtaining
from those classes it's okay to have fun
at college you're supposed to be there
to live life and meet people and go out
at night and have fun and have crazy
days you know that's not all about
trying to be this perfect person who is
going to excel in every educational
class you take you know you really have
to balance everything like you have to
balance your friends school
if you're in a sorority or fraternity
you have to balance that to college is
hard very hard classes are hard
professors are here to help you it
depends there are some really great
professors and I don't want to say that
there aren't because I've had like two
or three professors who have even after
the class ended they're like hi you had
being this class if you want to try and
get a here's what you could do and then
just do that work an email to me and
then but like it hey like who would do
that
barely professors will do that and if
you can find those professors they'll be
there for you and help you through
school but you're literally two minutes
late to a class that teachers secretly
like mmm mark that personal if you miss
one day you might get to be in the class
because you miss one day like they just
mark you off no one's here to pick up
your slack for you even though you pay
all this money to learn from them stuff
they don't care you really have to be
motivated in an environment like this
because honestly it's half and half I'm
literally surrounded by really great
motivated teens and then the other half
is like oh not going to class I'm not
going to do my homework at this AFET
like there's really unmotivated people
here and then you are going to be
exposed to so many different
personalities it's unreal
there are some amazing amazing people I
have met here you know everyone's just
from everywhere and I think that's
what's so cool about connecting with
people because I have best friends from
California and then there's some people
from Arizona and then people that are
just like on the east coast living on
the ocean it's amazing and I can't wait
to go and visit them on travel with them
all over the place so me being from
Chicago I learned just moved across the
country and I have nothing wrong with
that and a really independent person um
I have no problem living on my own yeah
I miss my family so much and I
so much and I'm so appreciative of
everything they give me but I was fine
with packing up and leaving and living
on my own I think it's I don't know
you're never really gonna get that
experience again or you decide to go
back home and live with your parents
this is your time to find yourself and
find who you are and what you like what
you don't like and the people you want
to surround yourself with with the
people you don't and I don't know you
kind of just challenge yourself living
on your own and it's really fun and new
and I love it so I'm from Chicago so
I've never lived in a place where Oh
Vegas is five hours from here in San
Diego's five hours from here I could
literally drive wherever I want um it's
amazing and I would never take that for
granted
but I think that is about it I hope you
