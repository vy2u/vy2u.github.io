video I'm really excited because I get
to show you my updated makeup routine
and all of the new products that I've
just been using and obsessed with in the
new year so if you guys want to know how
to get this really dewy flawless
finished foundation LOC
just keep on watching and if you guys
want to follow me on my Instagram it is
just at Cali Kaiser but without further
ado I would love to get in this video so
here we go to start our makeup look I'm
going to be taking the Bobbi Brown
vitamin enriched face base I love this
because it's like a moisturizer and a
primer in one I take some off the top
with my finger I love when things are
moisturizers and primers in one you can
see how hydrated my skin looks already
and it feels so amazing it's non greasy
as well do you guys ever get under
groans it's right here moving on to our
foundation which is the star of the
video I'm so excited to share this
product with you guys so thank you so
much to Bobbi Brown for sponsoring this
video
I love Bobbi Brown I've been using Bobbi
Brown probably for as long as I've
gotten into makeup just because my mom
has always used wavi Brown so this is
the bobbi brown skin long wear
weightless foundation and SPF 15 and
this is a full cover or free shine
control I love this this is a part of my
everyday makeup routine I've been using
it for about two weeks now this
packaging is gorgeous as well I'm just
using my Beauty Blender to start the
application process this specific
foundation is a skin loving formula that
just glides on seamlessly for natural
multi-dimensional mattifying coverage
that's breathable and weightless
instantly when I apply this it always
takes away my redness and just fixes all
of my pigments which I love since I
don't set my foundation with a setting
powder anymore because I have super
normal to dry skin it's amazing to have
something like this where it's kind of
that mattifying weightless look and then
I always bring it down to my neck like
this when I wear this foundation it
doesn't even feel like anything is on my
skin which I love I love any foundation
that makes it look like it's just my
skin and then I'm actually not wearing
any makeup and that's exactly what this
foundation does for me but what's really
cool is you guys should know that this
foundation is available in 30 different
skin tone correct shades and it retails
for forty six dollars at Sephora and
Bobbi Brown cosmetics calm I love this
stuff also this package
it's absolutely gorgeous so yeah it's
incorporated into my everyday makeup
routine I love the way it makes my skin
feel it's super weightless the Marines
sugar cane and natural mineral powders
just keep oil and shine in check while
that vitamin e and c and shea butter and
fuse my skin with healthy hydration and
that's how you're able to see the high
points of my face are already
highlighted through the hydration of
that shea butter which i love I'm
shining okay moving on I'm just taking
my by Terry under-eye concealer and I
just do
- baby dots otherwise some days I don't
even wear concealer some days I do it
just depends how I'm feeling and how
much time I have before class so I just
beauty blend but in this is a Holy Grail
product for me so for my contour I'm
taking the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade dim light and it has
to be perfect warmth to my face
do you see that okay so I just apply
this adding warmth to my face kind of
contouring but not really they add a
little under my nose and a little under
my lip as well but other than that for
an everyday look I don't really contour
my face heavily in a way and then
sometimes I even just like to brush that
out with a big fluffy brush moving on to
our eyebrows I'm taking the it brow
power powder that's wordy so this is
just the it cosmetics brow powder and
I'm just using a simple I bra brush to
just kind of pencil this in so I'm
taking a spoolie first just to brush out
my eyebrows and brush in the up motion
just to fill in those spaces
and then after I fill in my eyebrows I
take my chapstick because I don't have
any brow gel right now to keep them in
place so chapstick is just what we have
to what it's come down to so I'm just
putting chapstick on my eyebrows one of
my friends does that and that's
literally the only makeup she wears so I
stole that from her okay moving on to
our highlighter this is from Bobbi Brown
highlighter in the shade Afternoon below
this powder is absolutely so gorgeous it
literally makes you glow from within and
look how beautiful and pigmented this
formula is it's super creamy I love it
so I kind of just put it on the high
points of my cheeks I love when
highlighters kind of give me that wet or
dewy look and it can't you can't really
tell they put highlighter it doesn't
look like a powder is on my cheekbones
which I love and that's exactly what
this product does for me okay and then
for blush I'm moving on and I'm going to
be using just the Too Faced love flush
justify my love I love this packaging I
like to rub some excess off of my hand
and I just put this on the apples of my
cheeks
one thing I've been using every single
day for bronzer is just the Bali sans
Becca cosmetics sunlit bronzer I love
love love this stuff you can kind of
bring it down your neck a little too
okay moving on to my eyes in the
chocolate bar to face palette I'm
literally just going to be using this
white powder right here just to set my
eyes once I add a powder to set my
eyelids I'm just going to go back in
with my ambient lighting powder from
hourglass and I just like to use this as
a transition shade because it kind of
ties the monochromatic look that I'm
going for for my everyday makeup so
we're just doing this as a transition
shade and it shows up really well as you
guys can see that warmth coming through
after the eye shadow I'm going back in
with my Bobbi Brown highlighter in the
shade afternoon below and I'm just going
to be taking a different eye shadows
rush with this highlighter you can apply
it to your eye with a brush or your
finger but I personally just like to add
a little to my eyelid to make the look a
little bit more glowy and fresh and then
for some inner corner highlight I'm
going to be taking my Natasha de Nonna
eyes shadow palette 5 in the shade
number 4 and I'm just going to be taking
this as my inner corner highlight right
here I love to add a lot of inner corner
highlight I think it totally makes the
whole look okay then for my mascara I'm
taking the Mon seer big Lancome mascara
and don't even look at my eyelashes
right now I used to have eyelash
extensions and they kind of just all
fell out because I want my eyelashes to
breathe but I never got them removed so
there's just a few stragglers left but
we're definitely gonna put some mascara
on
okay moving on to our lips I'm just
adding some Burt's Bees chapstick I'm
gonna go in with a lip tint from Bobbi
Brown this is absolutely amazing it has
little sparkles in this lip tint so
we're just gonna do this and it is so
beautiful well this is so beautiful I
love lip tints because they totally come
to life once you put them on you guys
can see how much this lipton oxidizes
once it touches my lips because look at
how much more pigmented it is compared
to in the bottle but I love this this is
the extra lip tint in bare pink sparkle
thank you guys so much for taking the
time to watch my everyday makeup routine
I hope you love this look and if you
guys are wanting to get your hands on
the bobbi brown skin long wear
weightless foundation it is available at
Sephora for $46 I love you guys thank
