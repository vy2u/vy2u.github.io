if you cannot already tell I'm gonna be
showing you guys my night routine I
can't wait to get into this video if
you're gonna follow me on my Instagram
it's just iconic Kyser otherwise you
could click that button down below and
subscribe if you would like or if you're
not already but without further ado here
we go so the first thing I do right when
I walk in the door also if you guys are
wondering where my outfit is from I'll
have it linked down below for you guys
and this is my new apartment so you're
gonna get a little bit of sneak peek
before my apartment tour so yeah I
always wanted to just come home and plop
on my bed but I actually don't do that I
come home and I walk right into my room
and I'll usually just change into comfy
clothes if I'm not doing anything else
that night for example tonight I'm just
gonna be a loner and hang out so this is
so dope it is the best speaker and it's
a vinyl record player at the same time
so I basically this place ever since I'm
having dance party after that I head
straight to the kitchen because I'm
going to be making myself a really yummy
dinner you guys probably already know
that I am such a foodie and I'm obsessed
with cooking so I'm really excited
because I've partnered with hellofresh
for my dinner tonight hello fresh is a
meal kit delivery service that makes
cooking more fun so you could just focus
on the whole experience and not just the
final plate and then also each week they
create new delicious recipes with
step-by-step instructions and they're
all designs take around 30 minutes for
everyone from beginners to seasoned home
cooks short on time that is me I am
totally short on time throughout the
week with school and then focusing on
YouTube I don't have time to go to the
grocery store pick up a bunch of
ingredients and meal prep my entire week
so this is so nice because they do it
for me and hello fresh sources new
freshest ingredients measure to the
exact quantities needed so there is no
food waste and it's true there is no
they put the perfect amount of protein
perfect wine and greens or whatever the
recipe calls for for that specific meal
and what's really great is hellofresh
delivers food to your doorstep and
you're recycled insulated box for free
super simple you just open the box
and start cooking by following those six
easy steps and did I mention that each
meal is literally less than ten dollars
a meal I think that's so amazing
so as you guys can see here I'm still
following all the six steps I'm cutting
up my ciabatta bread I'm cutting up my
tomatoes for my salad and then
everything is perfectly portioned as I
mentioned earlier after I'm done mixing
my salad together I'm going to be taking
a my ciabatta bread off the stove adding
my grilled onions adding some salad on
there and then I also put the patties on
there obviously this was so delicious
and it was honestly really easy to make
it made me feel like a gourmet chef
what's really amazing is you can get $30
off your first week of deliveries if you
just visit hellofresh comm and enter the
promo code calli 30 when you subscribe
it's just the promo code calli 30 when
you subscribe but I hope you guys loved
what I made for dinner tonight it was so
good and it's totally filled me up it
was the perfect amount of food after I
made dinner I head straight to my
bathroom I comb out my hair before I
shower does anyone else do that anyways
I turned my shower on and for my shampoo
I used the Moroccan oil hydrating
shampoo holy cow the stuff smells so
good I'm not even kidding you and then
for my body wash I just use this
lavender shower gel I got it at Whole
Foods and of course my weave is yellow
because I'm obsessed this is my favorite
purple shampoo at the moment and then
the conditioner I'm using is this
Brazilian keratin therapy
I usually just focus all the conditioner
on the end of my hair but that is a huge
glob right there
and if for more that was up close for my
cleanser I'm using me in weight
confidence in a cleanser I love this
stuff once I get out of the shower I
just dry my hair off and I put it up
into a towel this is my favorite lotion
it's just the hemp solution I get it on
Amazon I can link it for you guys and
then for my face lotion I use the
confidence in a cream by a cosmetics
I'm obsessed it is the best moisturizer
I've ever used honestly once I put my
bathrobe on I never get out of it
so be warned if you owned a bathrobe
you're never gonna get out of it and
then I'm an idiot
so I put chapstick on before I brush my
teeth so I always brush my teeth before
bed I hope you guys do too once my hair
soaks in the towel for about 15 minutes
I let it air dry and take it out if you
have not used a wet brush before you
need to run a CVS right now and buy one
because they're so amazing and then the
oil that I put in my hair is just some
Moroccan oil I love the smell of it it
totally does the trick for me and I just
rub that all on the ends of my hair and
whatever is left over my fingers I'll
kind of bring it up to the roots but my
hair tends to get greasy quick so I just
keep that towards the ends and then I
just kind of scrunch my hair and it
dries in beach waves then I'll crawl
into bed and I'll check Instagram I'll
check all of your guys lovely YouTube
comments I love you guys are amazing
I'll respond to some of them I'll check
my friends snapchat stories and then the
greatest moment of the night is when I
turn on Criminal Minds Spencer Reid is
my favorite oh my gosh I'm not even
kidding I cancel plans to watch Criminal
Minds so I'll usually just fall asleep
watching Criminal Minds this is a huge
continuity fly turn the lights off
but I'm showing you guys how I sit in
bed and watch TV and then I actually
took it in my pajamas and then I get
into bed and then I go to sleep so I
hope you guys loved this video thank you
so much for watching I love you all so
much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
