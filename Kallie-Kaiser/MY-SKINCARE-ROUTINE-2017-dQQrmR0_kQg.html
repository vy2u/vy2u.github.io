this is veno so hey guys this counter
today's video I'm beyond excited because
I finally have my skincare routine down
my skin is looking the best it has ever
looked probably my entire life I'm 20
years old now and I've just got my
skincare routine down so if you're
feeling if you're younger than me and
you're feeling lost with skincare
it's fine don't worry about it um but
before we end this video please
subscribe my youtube channel if you
would like and my Instagram's XL Kaiser
if you wanna check me out on there
and if you want to start a street or
something on snapchat Kellyanne um but
yeah I'd love to see this videos in Rio
okay so I am normal to dry skin but you
guys see my skin being dry alright now
no I used to have really really cakey
foundation my nose would be cracking and
really dry and I would still be
moisturizing almost every day and night
so I just didn't understand why my skin
wasn't soaking the moisture or I don't
understand I didn't understand so my job
is going saying so I finally figured out
you have to sleep in a hydrating mask a
moisturizing mask anything like that so
my number one product that I can't live
without is the glam glow dream do
overnight transforming treatment this is
the best product I've ever used in my
entire life plus this packaging is
beautiful so it has two paws in here one
is a white fake mask and one is like a
Vickers red one you put this one out
first let it dry for 30 seconds and then
put this one on top it doesn't feel like
something's today on top of your face
when you're going to bed at night but
there is it's moisturizing hydrating
face all night long to the point when
you wake up in the morning it should
still be on but I'm gonna just use it
underneath my makeup and relax it off in
the morning
literally if you have dry skin this will
save your life my makeup looks flawless
today my Sunday
it doesn't look like I have dry skin at
all so this is just the best price ever
and then I always use this at night too
I sleep in this and just sleep in this
the package just goes together as well
this is the Glen glow wet lips unreal
I'll show you guys what it looks like on
the inside
I'm wearing it now the lip gloss in
addition to that it might be too white
but yes you need to sleep in a hydrating
mask or moisturizing mask anything like
that if you have dry skin II don't we
just going to be taking any more
plus I exfoliate 2 to 3 times a week
because I just keep my exploit or in the
shower and then whenever I shower
isolate okay talk about everyday face
cleansers and the exfoliator I use is
something a female clear complexion
foaming cleanser best cleanser I have
very sensitive skin as well so a lot of
products can react to my skin so I
should have stuff with all natural
ingredients etc etc so this is my
favorite cleanser that I use every
morning and night and then when I'm in
the shower I use an exfoliator and this
is the glam glow use mod it's single
exploiting treatment this is disgust
exfoliator ever just because it is so
rough if you have dry skin or anything
that's going to come off it's going to
take off that first layers dirt on your
face everything so it looks like this
smells really nice fresh in Queens kind
of colors and then once I get out of
shower I've turned my face so this is
the toner I use it's the fresh rose
Laurel toner and fuses soothing rose
water hydrates and refreshes I just
sprayed this on a cotton pad and then
wipe it all over my face and will take
off any excess dirt or any mascara
that's running underneath my eyes but I
also use the micellar cleansing water I
went gave it a toner but it definitely
feels similar to a toner when you put it
on a what's it called what is the name
of it I don't remember a con Pat con pad
if you put this on a cotton pad it has
similar effect and Underwood but it also
just is kind of like a Neutrogena face
wipe in liquid form and I really like
I recommend it also you should never put
any alcohol on your face or your
children should not have alcohol neck I
learned that from Jeffrey star I love
his videos
the weirdest thing they last night I had
a dream that Jeffrey star and I were
hanging out we went shopping together
it's Louie Vuitton store and then after
I tell my face these are my favorite
moisturizers that I use every single day
so this is the on dalu renewal cream
with programs seeing it I get this at
Whole Foods it's around 20 to 24 dollars
and then this is a little bit more
pricey definitely more pricey to the
case numbers of goat milk moisturizing
cream I loved it it has an amazing pump
used to open it like this then you
squeeze down the top and it just pours
out and I smell my face um but expert
office moisturizers I don't think you
should use the same one for six months
straight so I'll probably use this one
for straight models and switch off to
this one so I just depends the kind of
ten disciples on these two but I love
these products my favorite skincare
companies ever is what to do as we love
them they're amazing so this is a Mardi
or I don't know how pronounced French
word excuse me but this is a golden love
multivitamin oil for face body in here
you could spray this in your hair on
your body on your face I recently have
been using this as my body lotion so
obviously it's not lotions oil but I ran
out of my body lotion and I just spray
this all over my body and it soaks in
it's not oily on my clothes it won't
leave any oil things on my pants or
anything since it's on my legs and it
has such a subtle scent I absolutely
love it it wants it
you must rub it in and stuff it's not
oily dry but your skin is super hydrated
and it's not going to be itchy or pili
I'm from the winter cold outside and I
just want to show you with you guys my
favorite primer so this is the Marc
Jacobs invisible undercover perception
coconut primer and love this the casting
is beautiful it just has a really simple
pump that I usually do one pump
underneath my foundation but since I
have dry skin it's great for hydration
underneath the foundation if your
foundation is a pretty matte formula and
then sensor talking about more cheese
ooh I
except that this product I've been using
it for the past five or 60 years
it's the habla trouble spot treatment so
whenever I'm getting my period I get
really bad knit around my chin and nose
area so I just take - you just dip it in
and grab some of the pink formula at the
bottom and just dab it where it needs me
and it dragged it out overnight and it
should be gone within two days which is
amazing and it's also travel size and
then just talk about some face masks
that I use I have almost all legless
products because they are so amazing so
this is a Glen was super mug clean
treatment I don't put this on my entire
face because it dries out like crazy
but I thought looking this up you just
paint this on areas wearing the large
pores or you see blackheads or
whiteheads and it takes the toxins out
from the pores and it really reduces the
size of them this smells so good I don't
know what it is but it's just this
really cool dark charcoal color and then
I also have the hydrating mask explained
both from Blanco with me
this is the thirsty moderate so again
you could probably sleep in this they
say leave this on for 10 to 20 minutes
and use it two to three times a week it
just looks like that kind of with a
light pumpkin color this will smell
really really good too if you're more of
a warm smell - the clean smell but yeah
these are the some say snacks that I use
on a daily basis the rest of my skincare
is in LA but these are the products but
actually just obsessed with and I cannot
live without them so that is all my
skincare and it's gonna show you guys my
fully grills this stuff I use on daily
weekly fixes I hope you have enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up
and my Instagram and snapchat I will be
linked down below tripping off I love
you all hopefully you learned some sort
of tips if you have normal to dry skin
the trick is just to sleep in a
hydrating and moisturizing face mask I
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
