really wanted to do my tipsy and boxy
charm unboxing in one video together so
that's what I'm doing and we go so
there's nothing really new in my life
right now I did go to prom may 8th
here's a pic it was so much fun oh my
gosh um and I went to from my senior
year so i went from last year so this is
my second time going to prom and then
and I'm just so excited because summer
is among us I just cannot wait to go to
the beach all the time like I'll Drive
up to Michigan or I look right near
north avenue in chicago two hour drive
ok so since i combine this video I don't
really know which one to unbox first
since I love boxy charm I'm probably
just gonna a box boxy charm first so
this is the May box I already put a
knife through here so I could just like
easily open this up this says hello
Sharma we open it here's the car for
this month bold and beautiful be bold be
bright be beautiful this may go beyond
your comfort zone and boldly dare to be
your own kind of beautiful cool cool and
that just lists all the products and in
their prices on the side here ok so I'm
seeing really nice things in here let's
start over ok ok since everything just
fell out the first thing that fell out
was this so we'll take this at first
this is the lip bar comes in this really
nice cute velvet bag and there's this
interesting packaging the lit bar we got
a lipstick in the shade kiss me this is
a pretty color it's pretty killer I feel
like I have so many colors like this
they've always colors like this I don't
really like the packaging but that's
just my opinion the lip bar lipstick
full-size twenty dollars and this gives
you your lips a splash of color with
these bold hues from the lip are alright
guys so I'm trying on the lipstick for
you here's the color and the show you
kiss me from the lip bar and I don't
have a mirror just using the viewfinder
wow this is really bright um it's very
beautiful though I love the color so I
don't know how often i'll wear this
color it's very vibrant and beautiful i
love it though it's very summery and
springy um it looks good with the color
I'm wearing now which is just great but
yeah I do love it okay next thing is
that these are wrapped together so let's
just take it out now all right bubble
wrap these are like my favorite things
 ever uh Monaco bronze shimmer
bronzing powder 014 face and body yeah
yeah i mean i do a lil different in my
house okay Wow hmm really nice packaging
mmm so this is just bronze sure it's
like a bronzer but it's shimmery I
personally like matte bronzer and then
whatever shimmers in my face is going to
be my highlight but I feel like this
could look good with a summer look that
you're doing or for photos or something
so I'm really excited about this and my
doorbell captured ringing yeah this is a
really pretty color okay so for the mala
kbron shimmer full-size this is $22 all
of this uh body Oh Rafi raw trio Oh
sweetie so this is for your eyebrows if
you have like a spoolie brush with a
brush on the end of it
you can just dip that in here Newsies so
it comes with three different trades
three different shades for your brows I
use gimme brow from benefit for my
eyebrows so i don't know if i'll use
this a lot but maybe you never know and
i think this is the essential shade
alright so this is the biography brio
pile rip body grep body of graphy brow
trio full-size $19 great next items
awesome it comes with a brow brush yes I
wanted another one of these because the
spoolie brush that you used to like
brush your eyebrows mine is kind of just
like old and this is a nice round brush
so these go together awesome so this is
the brow brush full-size $19 these are
the exact same price 19 and 19 Wow okay
last item in here is a nail polish ok
this is the Lauren B beauty nail polish
full size eighteen dollars I love this
color it's so pretty in summary I can't
wait to use this and the gold on the
bottle is so cute i love like square
bottles modern is this really happening
okay so for that was all for boxy charm
now we will move on to it see I really
like to talk two terms this month it
looks really good stuff it's he better
top it I mean it won't because it sees
another full-size products okay so
here's the card Jet Set jetsetter cute
oh wow look at dezzy on this shows bomb
yeah okay I never use those ok so this
bag is actually super cute last month I
didn't really dig it but this month
totally dig it but the material is
really thin and cheap but then again
it's just like a cosmetic bag so this is
the design contents pretty important
stuff so cute all right first thing I
see in here Urban Decay revolution high
color lip gloss oh I'm not a lip gloss
okay all right
why is this white applies invisibly
vikon smooth and grabs the color to help
it last use it to fill in fine lines
prevent feathering and correct mistakes
that's so cool and then here is the
shades that I received sample sizes
right here oh yes this is a tapered
blending brush from look see okay I have
always wanted it like a tapered bunny
much like a sigma e40 or like a Mac I
don't remember the exact name of it but
this brush is really nice Oh next item
tantalizing cow I tape taupe taupe is
the color
okay so you fill in your eyebrows with
this and this is the branch Ella and
then we got oh my gosh yes we got these
smoothing and relaxing package it
patches with smoothing cornflower so you
put them underneath your eyes they're
like those white patches that you see
underneath people's eyes if they're like
pampering themselves so that I'm really
excited about this I've heard these I've
heard really good things about this and
this is the brand chlorine chlorine
chlorine I butcher named all the time
just ignore me okay and then there's one
more thing in the bag this is cops face
natural skin tone sheer matte finish
lightly tinted huh I don't know what
this is so this is what it looks like
what's really nice about this is it has
SPF 40 in it UVA protection
broad-spectrum water-resistant and this
is just a matte finish cool so I really
enjoyed everything I received this month
I'm so excited to try everything um I
love box of charm and nipsey so much and
hope thing I'll stop my subscription for
a while but boxy charm is $21 and it t
is ten dollars a month and then box
