video I really wanted you to do my Ipsy
and boxycharm unboxing in one video
together so that's what I'm doing and we
go so there's nothing really new in my
life right now I did get a prom may 8th
here's a pic it was so much fun oh my
gosh
and I went to prom my senior year so I
went from last year so this is my second
time going to problem and then and I'm
just so excited because summer is among
us I just cannot wait to go to the beach
all the time like I'll Drive up to
Michigan or I look right near North
Avenue in Chicago it's an hour drive
okay so since I combined this video I
don't really know which one to unbox
first since I love boxycharm I'm
probably just gonna a box boxycharm
first so this is the May box I already
put a knife through here so I could just
like easily open this up this says hello
Sharma when we open it here's the card
for this month bold and beautiful be
bold be bright be beautiful this may go
beyond your comfort zone and will be
dared to be your own kind of beautiful
cool cool and that just lists all the
products and in their prices on the side
here okay so I'm seeing really nice
things in here let's start over okay
okay since everything just fell out the
first thing that fell out was this so
we'll take this out first this is the
lip bar comes in this really nice cute
velvet bag and there's this interesting
packaging the lip bar we got a lipstick
in the shade kiss me this is a pretty
color it's particularly I feel like I
have so many colors
this they've always colored like this I
don't only like the packaging but that's
just my opinion the lip bar lipstick
full-size $20 and if this gives your
lips a splash of color with these bold
hues from the lip bar alright guys so
I'm trying on the lipstick for you
here's the color and the shade kiss me
from the lip bar and I don't have a
mirror just using the viewfinder
wow this is really bright it's very
beautiful though I love the color so I
don't know how often I'll wear this
color it's very vibrant and beautiful I
love it though
it's very summery and springy it looks
good with the color I'm wearing now
which is just great but yeah I do love
it okay next thing is that these are
wrap together so let's just take you
that now alright
bubble wrap these are like my favorite
things ever uh Monaco bronze shimmer
bronzing powder oh one for face and body
yeah okay Wow really nice packaging mmm
so this is just bronze ship it's like a
bronzer but it's shimmery I personally
like matte bronzer and then whatever
shimmers on my face is gonna be my
highlight but I feel like this could
look good with a summer look that you're
doing or for photos or something so I'm
really excited about this and my
doorbell captured ringing yeah this is a
really pretty color okay so for the
Mollica bronze shimmer full-size this is
$22 I love this uh body oh graphy brow
trio OC so this is for your eyebrows if
you have like a spoolie brush with a
brush on the end of it or something you
can just dip that
so it comes with three different trades
three different shades for your brows I
used gimme brow from benefit for my
eyebrow so I don't know if I'll use this
a lot but maybe you never know and I
think this is the essential shade all
right so this is the biography Briah
piyo grip body grip body of graphy brow
trio full size $19 great next items
awesome it comes with a brow brush yes
and one of another one of these because
the spoolie brush that you used to like
brush your eyebrows mine
it's kind of just like old and this is a
nice brow brush so these go together
awesome
so this is the brow brush full size $19
these are the exact same price 19 and 19
Wow okay last item in here is a nail
polish okay this is the Lauren B beauty
nail polish full-size $18
I love this color it's so pretty in
summary I can't wait to use this and the
gold on the bottle is so cute
I love like square bottles modern
I really happening oh okay so for that
was all for boxycharm now we will move
on to it see I really liked box of
charms this month it was really good
stuff if so you'd better stop it I mean
it won't because it sees another
full-size products pack
okay so here's the card Jet Set jet
setter cute oh wow look at desi on this
shows bomb yeah yeah okay I never use
this okay so this bag is actually super
cute last month I didn't really dig it
but this month totally dig it but the
material is really thin and cheap but
then again it's just like a cosmetic bag
so this is the design contents pretty
important stuff so cute alright first
thing I see in here Urban Decay
revolution high colour lip gloss
oh I love lip gloss okay alright
why is this white applies invisibly
vikon smoothing grams the color to help
it last use it to fill in fine lines
prevent feathering and correct mistakes
that's so cool and then here is the
shades that I received sample sizes oh
yes this is a tapered blending brush
from look see okay I have always wanted
it like a tapered blending brush like a
sigma e40 or like a Mac I don't remember
the exact name of it but this brush is
really nice
next item tantalizing cow I take taupe
taupe is that color
okay so you just filling your eyebrows
with this and this is the branch Ella
and then we got oh my gosh yes we got
these smoothing and relaxing packages
patches with smoothing cornflower so you
put them underneath your eyes they're
like those white patches that you see
underneath people's eyes if they're like
can't bring themselves so that I'm
really excited about this I've heard
these I heard really good things about
this and this is the brand chlorine
chlorine chlorine I put your names all
the time just ignore me
okay and then there's one more thing in
the bag this is COTS face natural skin
tone sheer matte finish lightly tinted
huh I don't know what this is so this is
what it looks like
what's really nice about this is it has
SPF 40 in it UVA protection
broad-spectrum water-resistant and this
is just a matte finish cool so I really
enjoyed everything I received this month
I'm so excited to try everything um I
love box of Charmin Ipsy so much and
hoping I'll stop my subscription for a
while but boxycharm is $21 an empty is
$10 a month and then box trimmers more
full-size items and it seems more like
sample size or deluxe items and you
could say but that's all for this video
