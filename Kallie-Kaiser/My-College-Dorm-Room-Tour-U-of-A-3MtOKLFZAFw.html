link down below description box but for
this one it is on my dorm room tour
which I'm so excited to share with you

style dorm my community style bathroom
in my hallway and then the study room
under my Hall if you guys want to follow
me through my college experience my
Instagram is at cala kaiser and my
snapchat is cali and also if you guys
are wondering why i filmed my intro and
outro in Illinois
it is because I'm home for spring break
and I'm so excited and I felt my dorm
room tour when I was packing and Tucson
to leave um to go to Chicago where I am
now but yeah so that's why I love you
guys so much I hope you guys really
enjoy this video and if you would like
to see my dorm room tour where I live in
a little cubicle just keep watching ok
guys to start in the hallway and enter
my room from the door there's our water
drugs I just got delivered but here is
the entrance to our door but yeah when I
open this up so right when we walk in
the first thing you're going to see is
my bed is right there Amber's bed is
right here and Natalie's bed is over
there you guys would know who my
roommates are if you watched our vlogs
to California together I will link it
down below in the description box if you
want to check that out but yes so if we
continue to walk in over to my section I
kind of have like this little cubicle to
myself which is really nice Natalie kind
of has that too and then Amber's life is
spread out which is still really cool
and she has a lot of space under her bed
which is really nice so I guess we
should start over here with what's on my
wall and these are just some photos of
me from high school I have some from
Lollapalooza right there I basically cut
out the edges of the photos here I don't
know why but I wanted them to all fit on
this square magnetic board that I got
from the Container Store and then as you
guys can see I sometimes hang jewelry on
the magnets and then I have this little
elf afee thing that Natalie's mom got me
and my roommate's
as we
to my desk this is where I keep all of
my makeup as you guys can see this is
super full and I do need some more
storage but I'm really loving this
foundation right now here's most of my
brushes and stuff and all of my
lipsticks I love lipsticks I think it
completes any makeup look this is from
home goods it's like this decorative
dear design tree if that makes sense and
I just decided to hang my jewelry on
that and then over here is where I keep
all of my eye makeup palettes and then
my contour palettes here is my phone I'm
leaving at two o'clock for my flight so
hopefully I filmed this video pretty
quick this is my computer with my cute
little alpha thei sticker on it and then
I got this marble case on Amazon I keep
the rest of my brushes in this really
cute mug I think someone got me this for
my graduation party oh no actually I
bought this at world market with my mom
and then here is just a beautiful photo
of my boyfriend and I if that would
focus I love this photo so much it's
from Lollapalooza this past summer and
then I have a photo of one of my
absolute best friends Kayla I actually
visit her at San Diego quite a bit in
California and then I have a photo of a
man died he was my little sister and I
love her so much oh my gosh um here is
my mirror you guys can see me what's up
I also have these super cool plants that
I got at HomeGoods I love them so much
they were literally like 2 bucks each
and I think they're so cute
and then here's Natalie's desk over here
and then Amber's desk is right over the
hair oh my gosh I just stuttered so bad
I don't even know what I just said I can
see our room is pretty like cluttered um
not very clean not really organized or
anything like look at our food bin over
here on top of the microwave it's just
like a hot mess it's because college
living is supposed to be cluttery and
it's not supposed to be organized it is
so messy it's hard to contantly me sony
my comforter is from Urban Outfitters
and this
is from home goods as well it was the
last one and it was a blessing that my
mom and I found it was amazing these are
both stuffed animals that Hayden has
given me when he went to Canada
obviously and then this one he just
brought me when we hung out one random
night and he took me on a date and then
she walked towards our door we hang all
of our towels and like those dress robes
that you wear when you walk in the
hallway instead of a towel with a guitar
dress we need to clean our mirror but
you guys can see me here Hey okay so
let's go to the closet here is amber
nice closet and Natalie's closet is
really organized and over here oh my
gosh literally obsessed with that she
got at Nordstrom's if anyone wants to
know the first thing that you'll see is
we just have a bunch of storage up there
my hangers are there and then I have
these cute little jars my big made me
but I just keep all my towels clean
sheets and anything linen wise in there
then if we move towards this first
bucket oh I keep my curling irons
blow-dryer crimper if anyone wonders how
I crimp my hair that is what I do
and then I have this nice little tin box
tin cylinder container from home goods
as well and then I just keep all my
cotton pads and q-tips in there here is
where I keep all of my shorts and jeans
and then I also have a little nail
polish collection going for those of you
who have been asking what color this
gray is it is this brand
Zoya and it is in the shade Carrie I
think these are called command strips I
just hang a command strip in my closet
to hang all of my bags and purses and
then I have a few of these fluff balls
that I got on Amazon for like two bucks
here is where I hang all my clothes as
you guys can see some flannels and stuff
like that over here I keep most of my
crop tops and like just sheer fun going
out shirts stuff like that
and you guys have seen most of this
stuff if you watched my recent haul but
most of my most worn clothes are going
to be in my suitcase which is right here
so underneath all of my clothes I have a
bucket of shoes which I brought way too
many shoes to college I don't wear them
a lot I'm in a theater major in a
stagecraft class and I ruined my
converse because I was helping paint a
backdrop I was painting like a flat they
covered in muslin so these are ruined
but it's fine here is where I keep all
of my like comfy shorts like you know
those brandy frill shorts stuff like
that here is where I keep all of my
bikinis which I will be doing a bikini
video so soon and I can't wait to share
it with you guys
but yes here is where I keep all my
bathing suits here is beauty products
vitamins face masks I put this in my
hair after showering if that will focus
on these are my favorite vitamins
they're from Whole Foods they're vitamin
C acerola or whatever this is my
favorite favorite dry shampoo ever NYC
but yeah I just have a lot of beauty
products there and then this is my
shower caddy that I bring to the shower
with me which I will show you guys the
bathroom soon but yeah so when I go to
the shower I just take this out head to
the shower toothbrush and stuff is in
here this is my favorite favorite
favorite hand and body lotion it's just
my favorite body lotion ever it smells
amazing if you guys know me you know I'm
super weird with smells so this is the
best I love it so much
it smelled like warm shea butter or
something and then Amber's closet is
right next to mine she has literally the
best clothes and shoes on the planet
Earth
alright so underneath my bed I have a
dresser that came with the dorm I bought
these two containers recently at Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and this is from Bed Bath
&amp;amp; Beyond as well and my clock is super
cool because it changes colors it is
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond as well here is
what underneath my bed looks like I have
an entire rack of shoes under here
honestly never bring this many shoes to
college I'm telling you right now I
barely wear any of these because when
you go out to a fraternity or something
they get trashed just from walking on
the rocks and stuff like Exhibit A this
is disgusting and I spent $80 on these
so just buy like really cheap $10 $20
shoes from forever 21 and wear those out
and save your really nice shoes for
going out to dinner or something but
yeah here is just a glimpse at my shoe
collection and then I don't know why I
have a random blue wig right there
no it's donation my dirty hamper is here
and then in here I just keep most of my
shirts that I wear all the time um kind
of messy not really posted or anything
and then in this drawer down here it's
kind of like my junk food drawer um I
just have a bunch of snacks to snack on
like these cookies from Trader Joe's if
anyone knows what I'm talking about that
these are the best they are literally
the best and then this really good
kettle corn which I really really love
up here I keep all of my workout clothes
so sports bras oh my gosh I only have
one hand as I was saying sports bras
leggings tank top stuff like that just
all my workout clothes and then here I
just have random sweatshirts oh my gosh
same thing is happening oh this do not
buy this it is from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
and is the flaky alike floppiest drawers
I own do not buy this these are the
greatest things ever honestly these are
the greatest things ever you need to buy
these in the first drawer of this
dresser that came with the dorm I keep
my socks bras underwear over here and
then I have bra Letson here and stuff
and here is my pajama drawer or t-shirt
drawer I fold them like this because you
save so much space shoutout to Matty
Riker
you taught me this when I visit you at
Denver but yeah honestly this is the
greatest way to store t-shirts if you
especially are bringing a lot which
honestly I probably wear this mount and
I have all of these so don't bring a lot
of clothes to college it's not worth it
and then in here I just have lots of
black and white clothes that I wear a
lot
here is if you guys want a better view
of our room I'm just going to pan and
show you guys everything not only I'm
sitting on your bed I'm sorry
so my bed is literally the comfiest
thing on the planet Earth it's comfier
than my bed at home because in a dorm or
like if you go to Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond you
can get like these foam things and it's
just literally so so cozy okay so here
is a peek at what is right outside my
dorm as you guys can see the mountains
are over there
this is PSU where you can get food like
Coors right there which had salads and
stir fries and stuff and then bagel talk
which is just like Einstein bagels but
yeah we have beach volleyball courts
right outside our dorm right here it's
so so awesome and then that is pretty
much it for this view so our room is
actually pretty clean I mean people that
usually upload dorm room tours I'm sure
their dorm is way cleaner but honestly I
just wanted to show you guys the truth
behind living in a dorm and I didn't
want to make it seem like our room is
perfect or anything we do have a lot of
stuff in here but there is plenty of
room especially living with three other
people so it's not really that big of a
deal we honestly can't complain this is
the bomb Amber's mom bejeweled this for
her for the room and it was so cool her
bed used to be right here but we decided
to move it over there and then any one
Direction fans they love one direction
my roommates are obsessed okay I want to
show you guys what I saw warm a
classroom looks like so the tiles
you'll ever see in your entire life but
there's a bunch of stall bunch of things
as you can see only one person is in
here showering there's a bunch of room
Hey yeah as we go back here I'll show
you guys the showers look like this
shower there a shower there
this showers really big and nice that
this is like what a small one looks like
you have to shower with shoes on because
it's not the most sanitary but honestly
we have a shower so it's fine
here is the toilets and then the sinks
are over there this shower is really
nice let me turn the light on everyone
so this is one of my favorite showers
charm because it's so big and the water
comes down in there the best thing about
dorm showers is the hot water never runs
out I hang my towels on there honestly
this bathroom is really nice it's
cleaned every single day except for on
the weekends and ya have a really nice
study room at the end of our hall which
is so fun we all just go in here and
hang out and do homework and stuff but
as you guys can see it has an amazing
view of the campus and this window is
just massive sometimes my friends and I
will go and take photos over there but
only so that like we shoot down so that
you can only see the palm trees but you
can see the basketball courts basketball
there volleyball courts and this is the
palm tree that's right outside my window
but yeah and then here is the really
nice study room this dorm used to be a
dance hall so that's why there's a
mirror with a ballet bar sometimes I'll
FaceTime in here at night or we all just
hang out in here and do homework so much
baby time watch this video I really I'm
going to graph it thank you guys so much
