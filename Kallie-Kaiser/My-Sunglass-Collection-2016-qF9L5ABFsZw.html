going to be filling a sunglass
collection just because everyone always
asked me wearing my sunglasses from and
it's just really frequently asked
questions so I thought I should just
throw it out there
what's unless is I own and where they're
from also it is 2016
super weird I remember being in high
school it was like 2012 and everyone
thought the world was gonna end
yeah thank you so much guys I finally
hit 50k on YouTube I could not be more
excited I love you all so much
and I do read every single comment I try
and respond to as many as possible
I you guys are some of the nicest people
I've ever met you guys are so supportive
so thank you thank you thank you I love
you all so much
hopefully I'll be doing a giveaway soon
I really want to get back to you guys
and without further ado here we go this
pair of sunglasses are from Free People
I got them probably a little over a year
ago I just think they're super fun
they're kind of like a cat eye and then
they have tortoise on the side whoops
they tore sunset and they're just clear
plastic I think those are still in and I
think they're super fun they photograph
really great and they were not expensive
which is great Free People makes very
inexpensive sunglasses so you should
totally check them out these Ravens are
probably my favorite sub S as I own just
because you probably see them in every
photo on Instagram my puppies in the
cage right here and you can cheer her
but so they're just like that red orange
neither polarize as well um they're the
ovals
hippy hippy ish I don't know um
I'm obsessed with these I will link down
the exact style number because a lot of
people ask me where I get these from
these are rabe and and I've had these
for about a year now and they actually
same brand new the next three pairs
actually are all from the same brand
called fryers I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right it's fre y RS um
the this brand is really popular on
Instagram I love their glasses so I just
have these matte black cat eye ones I
think they're super stylish and fun and
I think they look really good with all
black I love these and then I have this
pair which is all my favorite from like
on their website um it's cat eye and it
has like cutouts on the sides right here
with black lenses which I love and then
the metals kind of rose gold goldish
which is super cute this pair is super
fun um they're purple lenses with gold
and then the cutout is in the center
they're kind of an 80-year design I
guess you could say I don't know if you
can see the purple they're just super
I can't wait to the way these in the
summer and spring they're going to look
great with all black outfits and then
just have a pop of color
I think sunglasses are so cool so I'm
really excited to have a fun spunky pair
like these for my next pair sunglasses I
don't know about you but I cannot afford
designer sunglasses and these are
designer but I do have a pair of
ray-bans which I believe is resigner but
um so these are Alyssa
ilist Ava however cannot set I am
obsessed with these I got these on shop
dito that use a hashtag on social media
endless eyewear it's a subscription box
where you buy some not buy you rent
sunglasses for $24 a month it is
probably one of the greatest things I've
ever seen to be honest so I got these
this month
they're the illest Ava's silver lenses
and then they're just tortoise I love
this shape and design of these I've had
these for over a little longer than
just because I love them so much I don't
want to return them so this company
shopped it or endless eyewear sends you
designer sunglasses for paying $24 a
month and I can get you guys a month
free it's just using my code Kelly
Kaiser if you want a month free um and
then to just try it out otherwise its
$24 a month um yeah so I have to ship
these back I've recently just got my new
shipment so how it comes it comes in
these huge boxes sunglasses and a pretty
tissue and then it comes in this white
box that says ditto on it and then when
you actually get the next shipment of
your sunglasses to kind of trade them
out you comes in like a nice package
like foam packaging and then you just
take out your new pair of sunglasses and
then you return the old pair with this
return label that is found in here and
then you can just take over this and
send on this way so this pair I picked
out is um you know I love muumuu um I
think their glasses are so great so this
is what it looks like it came in this
really really pretty pink velvet
sunglass case and then they're just like
this these are the glasses I got um
they're tortoise with really really nice
lenses I think it's also fun I think
they're kind of old-fashioned or I don't
know what decade but they're super retro
I can't wait to shoot in them I think
they're super fun and they also come
with a bag that you can put in your
purse with the sunglasses and then
cleaning for the Sony's I will link down
below in the description box all about
shop ditto and stuff and my code Kelly
Kaiser if you guys want a first month
free I think it's awesome because you're
paying twenty four dollars a month for
sunglasses that cost up to five hundred
dollars or a thousand
I know these maybe were around 200
no ox maybe three I'm not sure but
designer sunglasses are really expensive
and a lot of people cannot afford such
like this so I think this is a great
alternative thank you guys so much for
taking the time to watch this video I
love you all so much and you guys want
to check out shop ditto or any other
sunglasses brands the links will be down
below in the description box like
Twitter instagrams at Kelly Kaiser for
all social medias and my snapchat is
Kalyan if you want to be friends on
there I love you guys so much thank you
so much for 50,000 scribers I love you
all so much I can't read your comments
and keep responding to them I love you
guys okay bye have an awesome day give
me a thumbs up if you want and subscribe
