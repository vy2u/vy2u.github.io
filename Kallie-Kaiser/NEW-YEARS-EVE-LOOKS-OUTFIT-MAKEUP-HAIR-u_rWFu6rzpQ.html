I wanted to create three different newsy
looks for you guys this year I don't
even think we're doing anything super
fancy so I'm probably just going to hang
in a sweat drinking champagne with our
friends and family but if you guys are
looking for inspiration or trying to
impress someone this is the video for
you I changed up the hair and makeup in
every single look a little bit and then
all the outfits are completely different
I'll try and leave links down below in
the description box if some of the
outfits or pieces I'm wearing in each
look are still so online but I know some
of them won't be available just because
I bought them at a sample sale or they
just aren't sold anymore
also I changed that my hair a bit on up
you guys can tell we did some super
blond highlights and then toned at the
top in this dusty blue color aren't no
you guys can see the blueness but I'm
absolutely loving it I almost just
wanted on my whole head like light blue
or silvery blue I don't know but don't
forget to follow me on my social is my
instrument at colonizer and my snapchat
is Kellyanne and is on public but
without further ado I'd love to hear
this video so here we go
for the first look I'm just brushing out
my hair and I'm taking my Moroccan oil
dry shampoo and spring this in my hair
if any of you guys have used the oil
from rocking oil it smells so good and
that is exactly what the dry shampoo
smells like and I'm just buffing that in
with my fingertips and separating my
hair into two different parts because we
are doing ponytail or pigtail buns
however you guys want to call it
I'm just taking out the pieces I don't
want to include into the bun and I would
normally take a clear plastic ponytail
but I didn't have any so we're using a
bright blue
when I was checking out of from 21 I saw
this hair glitter and had to get it I
thought it was perfect for New Year's
Eve its unscented and it dries really
fast so I just stole a extra mascara
spoolie when I was hanging out at
Sephora not hey-oh when I was shopping
at Sephora you guys know I'm talking
about but you can see these on the
counter zor-el too I'm sure
and it turned out so cool I love the way
it looked I think it looks better if you
strand it down but I decided put it all
over my head and then for our makeup
we're just doing a rose gold smokey eye
you guys can watch my everyday makeup
tutorial if you want a tutorial on this
look but I'm just adding some
highlighter putting some mascara on and
for the lipstick today I'm using the
lust o4 Pat McGrath blood of one red
lipstick oh my gosh this colors
out-of-this-world I love it and for our
outfit I am wearing this amazing choker
from fawn star I'll have it linked down
below in the description box
it actually glistens and glows in the
Sun it's so pretty it is their wish you
bitch choker and coal and gold I cannot
talk and for my dress I'm wearing this
beautiful silky black tank dress from
sisters the label they're the best
company ever I love them so much and
then my shoes are from public desire
these are the soft booties I love these
as well so back to this dress if you
guys are looking for a coupon code I'll
have it linked down below Scripture box
but it is stunning I love it and I love
how it's just a tank top and hangs on me
for the next look I'm brushing my hair
up into a really high sleek ponytail
because I love the way that looks it
almost looks high-fashion and super
clean and nice for our makeup look I'm
going to be taking the tape trick
because we are doing a smoky cat eye
today and this isn't a tutorial
obviously but I'm just taking bronzy
brown eye shadows and blending them all
together and I'll remove the tape at the
end and then I'm putting the Pat McGrath
lust one color all over my eyelids it's
totally safe to put these lipsticks on
your eyes and I'm using that as a base
to pack on this beautiful glitter that
also came in LA so for kit if you guys
ever watched my
review on that you know what Pat McGrath
is and what products I'm using and I
just added some mascara to that and I'm
using the same lipstick on the bottom so
my children is from moon shook moon
shock chokers I believe my body suits
from subdued I'll have everything linked
down below description box for you guys
and I'm wearing this amazing little
cardigan or shawl I guess you could call
it with these sparkly sequins and
amazing black fringe just hanging all
over it it's from Planet blue sample
sale so it's no longer on sale and then
these shoes are amazing they're from
Zara love them I just got them you could
totally wear socks or tights with them
too and my jeans are just plain black
jeans from car more than for the third
look I'm taking my bed head three barrel
crimper I've had this for so many years
it is amazing it's unreal if you don't
know how to braid or French braid your
hair to get these results this is the
crimper that you want so once you finish
crimping your whole entire head it's
super bouncy and voluminous and then
we're going to do a fun rocker I don't
know if it would be 70s or 90s look I
don't know so I'm just parting it and I
had to grab my sister for the next part
because I do not know how to French
braid I've tried to learn but I just
can't so if you know how to French braid
congrats you can succeed this look but
other than that grab your mom or anyone
who knows how to
once you finish french braiding it looks
so cool it's almost like a rocker
hairstyle I could be wrong but I
absolutely am in love with it and I
would actually use clear ponytails
instead of blue and red ones for my
makeup today I'm taking mac fix+ on a
little paddle brush and I just dipped it
into a really pronounced silver
eyeshadow and I'm just putting that all
over my lid I previously had black
smokey this going on with my eyeshadow
and then I just added this glitter as
well to my lower lashline and top
lashline added some mascara and then for
lipstick I'm using the Marc Jacobs moody
Margaux it is their gel lipstick I love
this stuff and then that is complete for
the lipstick I also added highlighter
now to move on to our outfit I'm wearing
this unreal choker from choker and
things I'll have it linked down below
description box it goes so well with my
eye shadow it looks so pretty
this also glistens and shines in the Sun
or light so my fishnets are from sel and
my top is velvet so nice it's that
crushed velvet from Zara and it's in
like a purple blue purple color I love
it my black high-waisted corduroys are
from subdued again everything will be
linked down below and I didn't really
know what shoes to pair this way
probably should pair them with the first
pair of booties I wore but I just want
to keep it simple and I wanted to show
my fishnets so I just paired them with
these really simple Topshop black
booties and that is all I hope you guys
