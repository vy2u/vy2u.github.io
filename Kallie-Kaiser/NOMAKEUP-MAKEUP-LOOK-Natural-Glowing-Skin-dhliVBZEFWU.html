I'm sure you guys might know make it
makeup look
so obviously I'm starting with fresh
face I don't have anything in my face
right now
I like the less is more tight makeup
throughout the day and then at night
just go crazy do blue eyeliner have a
sparkly silver cat I love all that stuff
but you guys have requested this video
and I've wanted to film it for a while
so I'm just going to be showing you guys
these simple steps that I use to get a
really natural look throughout the day
and here we go okay I'm taking my mac
fix+
and spring this is my face cover the
bangs so how does mean every time I just
use that to prep my skin and get ready
for makeup and then I instantly go in
with my Marc Jacob favorite primer this
is the invisible undercover coconut
primer I love this stuff because my face
is dry to normal skin and this
moisturizes and Prime I do around
one-pump looks like that and then I
suppose on I'll use this to prime my
eyelids too and then I bring it all the
way down to the neck now I want to take
my wet lip by Glenn blow this is the
best chat together if anyone's wondering
it looks like this and I just like to
apply it I also wear this as an everyday
lip gloss it was I can never talk it
just looks so good
now that we are primed and ready to
apply our makeup I know how much product
I want to use this is the it cosmetics
CC cream in the shade fair this is a
full coverage cream and then this is the
cap on the market foundation you can use
any CC cream or any foundation for any
no makeup makeup look if that's what
you're going for
I just don't which one to use today okay
I'm just going to go with the Kat Von D
foundation just because I'm going to
Lumineers counter tonight and I'm not
going to change my makeup so I do about
3/4 of a pump of the foundation for this
and then I take my foundation brush this
is become
lection perfection having Ling Lux a
cosmetics brush and I just go in
and then I go in with my laura mercier
translucent setting powder you don't
have to set your face if you don't want
to I just like to set my under eyes so
I'm just taking a little bit on a brush
and I just put that under around my nose
this places where I spy my face getting
oily throughout the day if I had makeup
on all day long for eyebrows I like to
take the a cosmetics brow power and I
fill them in and then I take these gimme
brow from benefit and I should put that
right over it so first I out my eyebrows
guys lately I've been going in at 3 a.m.
and I wake up at 1 p.m. every day is so
bad it's because I've been watching the
show Prison Break I've lately been
obsessed with it and it owns me right
now
so my eyebrows are never even but and
then I am taking the hourglass ambient
lighting powder in the shade dim light
holy crap this is the best product I've
ever used in my life so if I hope it's
not my skin tone you can already tell
that it's really pale but I don't have
to use contour shade or bronzer when I
use this product and if you have a
darker skin tone just get a darker shade
that would go with your skin so I use
this as a contour and bronzer it's
amazing so it just creates natural
shadows on our face oh my gosh amazing
this powder is just the key to my life
it just creates the best natural looking
shadows so the identities bronzer or
contour on my face and then to move on I
just do one eyeshadow color and I'm just
taking my Laura Mercier candle light
loose powder from Laura Mercier and I
just did my tapered blending brush into
that where it is right here just one
brush I'm dipping into that this
products will click that it's a nice dip
in here take off any excess and we're
just doing one eyeshadow shade today I
normally just do one eyeshadow shade
whenever it's a natural look or I might
as well just put foundation on my
eyelids and might not even see my shadow
look and then my favorite part this is
the Mac soft and gentle mineralized
skinfinish best highlighter I've ever
used in my entire life it's unreal and
I'm just taking us up for a highlighting
brush for this
so dip in like this and it just gives
the best natural glow to the face I add
on my nose I don't think you'd ever have
too much eyeliner I also like to add
this on my eyes / - and
and I once you finish with highlighter
you can choose to wear a pair or not
normally I won't commit thereon but
since today I'm going to a concert
tonight I'm going to semester on this
would be superhero it cosmetics mascara
I'm going to be putting a little bit of
mascara only wet like smells good after
you guys Aggie rescue or you choose not
to wear mascara I love this look I wear
it every single day I'll we're just
looking shoes to take photos in it's
just super natural and doing and it
really just shows your skin tone which I
love but I love you guys so much thank
