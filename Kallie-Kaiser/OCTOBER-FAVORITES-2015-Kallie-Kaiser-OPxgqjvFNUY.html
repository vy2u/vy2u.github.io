I am very excited about it because I
haven't done a favorites video in a
really long time and I really think my
favorites videos are some of your
favorites plus they're just really fun
to make so I have quite a few items and
I'm going to show you guys in this video
that I've just been using over the past
two months or just like random nonsense
that I need to share with you so let's
go
I know it's suppose we fall but I'm so
obsessed with pastels so I have these
two colors from essays and this one is
like my all-time favorite nail polish
ever besides black or white I use se
because my nails won't ship until like
the fifth day of wearing it which i
think is really nice these are my real
nails they're pretty long out of you
guys can see from here so this is bikini
so teeny from Essie a lot of people have
asked me in real life when I'm wearing
it or just online if I'm wearing it in a
photo or something they like they want
to know what the color is so this is
bikini so teeny from Essie and I'm
obsessed with it and this is play date I
believe yes play date it is just like
the most perfect purple my favorite
color has always been green like my
entire life but it's starting to be like
periwinkle and purple which is so weird
because I've never had my favorite color
change so these are my favorite I see
colors at the moment you should know
that I'm using my other lens I have two
different lenses for my camera this one
is like my favorite lens ever it's this
Sigma 30 millimeter F one point 4 lens
it's a focus lens so it doesn't zoom in
and out like wide-angle if you I guess I
don't know I don't know a lot about
lenses but I take all of my Instagram
photos with this lens I love this lens
it's it's amazing I got this on Amazon
for it was expensive I got it for 3
23:40 I think and it retails for five
hundred twenty dollars and I bought this
used so for people that have been asking
about what lens I use or like what
camera I have it's the lens I do have
the Canon t5i but the base isn't as
important as the lens you're using right
now I'm just filming with my lens that
came with my camera because I'm filling
in my dorm room and in order to film
with this
you have to quit sit like quite away
from the camera if that makes sense
because it doesn't soom this camera like
zooms in and out as you can see like
pretty well so um I have it on auto
focus right now because um I do so yeah
uber how many people have heard of uber
oh my gosh I can't talk I don't know how
many people have heard of uber but where
I go to school University of Arizona
people use uber like it's a religion and
if we go get food we over there unless
you have a friend that has a car then
you're very lucky but even if we're like
going from Party to party at night um
we'll drive uber it's very safe so I
have a goober code for first-time users
only so if you've never had it over as
an app or created account with them you
could sign up with my code SAV ekl saves
Cal in all caps you just plug it in when
you make an account and you get a free
first ride up to $20 I remember when I
went to Lollapalooza back in Chicago in
the summer I used my first free $20 uber
ride and it was so cool and I loved how
safe we were in which oh my gosh guys I
hit this every single night of my life
like I'm leaning in my bed my watching
TV or I'm on my computer and I'm just
like constantly hit that so I'm so sorry
but um yeah so use my uber code my best
frien at Grace Collins is an amazing
singer and I really wanted to put her in
my favorites video before but have never
made one in a while so I'm so excited to
put her in this video I will insert a
clip here of her singing
a victory March it's a cold and it's a
broken hallelujah she's in love with a
kind same Sifl Rogers house a mansion
we're in love but just nobody yay
- tell me how suppose you see the magic
cuz I don't believe in no don't tell cuz
I always imagined it's easier if
see I don't think you love me no more
you never seen it call me lady I don't
think you know me at all I've never
thought I'd have to say this no I don't
love you you'll never do look at us
running down plays the case just are not

it's over
yeah so she has a soundcloud I keep
hitting she has a SoundCloud you guys
have to go check her out her voice is
amazing I'm like raspy I love it I miss
her so much she goes to college we go to
college in two different states so it's
said that we don't see each other a lot
but I am so excited to go home for
Thanksgiving break huh okay but anyway
you have to check her out on Instagram
and her snapchat she posts like seeing
videos all over the place on Twitter I
will put all of her stuff down below in
my description box but her soundcloud is
here this is her SoundCloud
this is her Instagram and this is her
Twitter you guys have to check her out
her voice is amazing and I love her so
much okay I am obsessed with anything
that straps up lately I think it is like
the coolest trend anything that straps
up in a suede so right now I'm wearing
this like strap up sure I don't know if
you guys can see it it's so cute it's
like a cropped crop top so I wear it
with high-waisted jeans of course and it
just started to get warm here and air is
warm it just started to get a little bit
cooler on the weekends or like during
weekday somedays so it's really exciting
to wear flannel and stuff and beanies
I'm obsessed with beanies but um yeah so
what I have to show you guys that I love
that straps up so I am obsessed with
this bra line I got it LF I've been
wearing it like crazy lately
just like with t-shirts and stuff and
like sweaters that kind of like swoop
and then I also gotten this from LF it's
just this really really cute sweater I
haven't worn it yet because as the tags
on it because it just started to be able
to wear sweaters and I can't wait to
wear this probably on Thanksgiving
but it just like has the strap design in
the middle and then it's kind of like a
cropped sweater so I'll definitely be
wearing that was like a high-waisted
skirt or jeans and then I have these two
lace-up shirts from Isabelle's cabinet
I'm obsessed with Isabelle's cabinet
they have the best clothes and it's so
affordable I leave a link down below in
their description box this is from his
boss cabinet which I love and then these
are like the similar diet designs but
it's tank top version with the strap
eNOS going on
and then it's a bodysuit like a
one-piece if that makes sense and it
clips down below and then I haven't won
this one yet because again it just
started to get chilly in Arizona so
people are starting wear long sleeves
but this is a gray long-sleeve strappy
one-piece that I'm obsessed with and in
suede okay um suede is so in which I'm
obsessed with I don't know how many
times I've said obsessed by now but I
got this suede skirt from LF it has
pockets on the sides and it's just
high-waisted and then the back is a
zipper oh my gosh I adore this skirt so
much and then I got this super cute tank
top from Isabelle's cabinet I believe a
link down below for them you guys have
to check them out I love their clothes
like look how pretty like the bridge or
like cutout down the shirt and this is
like that halter style it's the brand
cotton candy and it's a size small so
I'm obsessed with that and then I also
have this like cute brands Wildcat it's
funny
and then it's like this suede like crop
top with fringe that just goes down
they're kind of tangled right now but I
thought this would look super cool with
my leather jacket which I can't wait to
wear yes so I'm loving anything that
lace ups or is suede right now and I
really wanted to share it with you I
don't know if people normally put
clothes in their favorites videos but I
just did okay so I have two favorite
mascaras that I will use for the rest of
my life probably
so the first mascara that I have is boy
shave ooh French accents and this is
their eiffel tower mascara and then I
have from benefit their roller lash I
love this packaging I think it's so cute
um but the reason why I have two
favorite mascaras is because they have
totally different applicators so to talk
about part review first is I am obsessed
with this because it is the most natural
looking mascara that I own and it gives
my lashes like the longest potential
length that they could get to and I'm
obsessed with that um and it just has a
huge applicator as you guys
see with really nice bristles on it so
this is like my Holy Grail I will always
return back to this mess here I'm
obsessed with it and then this one
clumps a lot this one doesn't clump on
me but this one clumps like crazy on my
lashes which is fine because I only
complain about that stuff but this is
like a rubbery applicator and it's
smaller this makes my lashes so so long
and it really like is pronounced so I'll
wear this when I take photos or I'm
filming yeah next thing I want to talk
about with you guys is colour-pop
cosmetics I've talked about color pop on
my channel before if you've been
following me for over a year then you
know I have a color pop review video um
I have three color pop products that I'm
obsessed with I'm wearing one of them
right now I'm wearing this glitter eye
shadow which I'm obsessed with I think
it's just absolutely gorgeous
and the shade I'm wearing right now is
millionaire and it's scope in are so
pigmented and metallic I'm obsessed with
them this is a super shock eye shut
super shock eye shadow and then I also
have this one which is fringe and it's a
super shock shadow and then they
recently came out with highlights
blushes and bronzers I did buy run some
but I haven't used it yet I use their
highlighter and it's me this is in the
shade wisp and it's a super shock super
shock I cannot talk if you guys can see
this but yeah like it's just really
really really really nice I love love
love color pop I think it's so
inexpensive and so affordable for anyone
these are five dollars the eye shadows
and then this is eight dollars I
recently watched a review on morphe
brushes like eyeshadow palette so I was
obsessed and I had to pick some up so I
literally just got these in the mail
today and I've only done like swatches
with them I haven't really put them on
my eyelids yet but from the reviews and
what people have said about them I know
that they're really good but this one is
35 T and the colors are gorgeous some
are metallics and then there are some
really pretty Browns and purples that
are matte in there
here I'll swatch one metallic
so you so you guys can see but so pretty
oh wait I just totally swatch that on
top of another one you can tell right
here but um yeah I'm obsessed with this
one and then the next one that I got is
35n and this one's all matte colors
I don't own a palette with all matte
colors so here's a close-up of that but
yeah I'm really excited to try these out
and probably use them every single day
of my life
so wait we have been loving the
Instagram update I think it is so fun
how you can do the what's it called this
how you can make the photo like bigger
and smaller I think that is so cool um
ah I don't know what I pressed but yeah
I've been taking advantage of that
lately how you can post like a full
photo like that I think that I so fun
but don't know locate my feet so I'm
really nervous since I don't like
anything fruity or I don't like hair
products in general like hairspray stay
away unless it's like that Moroccan oil
because has that warmer and like nice
dent so I picked this freshen up dry
shampoo from event NYC oh my gosh this
stuff is amazing it also gives my hair a
little volume when I spray it not I
don't use this because my hair is like
constantly greasy or I don't shower I do
shower um it's just it's it takes if
you've even half with a little bit of
grease it takes it all out I originally
got the sample size in my Ipsy bag and I
use that right away when I came to
college and I had to order a big
container this is already like halfway
done but I really needed to share this
with you guys and I think you'll love it
I just started wearing foundation this
year and I've only like played around
with a few different brands of
foundation I've used benefit I've used
brought review which I'm obsessed with
and I ran out which I need to get more
of but right now I'm using the bare
minerals bare skin a pure brightening
serum foundation
I have normal to dry skin so this is
amazing because it has coconut oil in it
so you have to shake it really well when
you use it and like put it on your face
but it's really good coverage but it
feels like I'm not wearing makeup at all
I'm wearing it right now and I have just
like a few red spots on my face and it
covers them right up sometimes I don't
even need to wear concealer when I put
this on anyone that has shopped at Whole
Foods or Trader Joe's you know what
panda puffs are these this is my
favorite cereal ever I don't know if
you're better than Captain Crunch
because I haven't had Captain Crunch in
like 60 years but this is the next best
thing
they're pano puffs they're really free
wheat free and 9 grams of whole wheat
whole ring all right now with whole
grain so I just had to throw these in
here because being a college student I
am constantly sometimes eating cereal
for lunch and that's okay what I would
go to if I get hungry and I have nothing
else to snack on in my room so I don't
know I kind of dig my case this month or
I got a new case because before it had a
mirror on it and it just was like a
dollar at Urban Outfitters sale or
something because I just need a case I
don't really spend money on cases so I
got this at the original online and I
thought it was just so fun I said the
iPhone 5s but I also have just been
loving watches lately and I think this
one is probably my favorite that I own
it's just really really subtle it's from
the brand Daniel Wellington I believe it
is I do have a discount code for Daniel
Wellington watches and I will leave all
that information down below in my
description box so you can check that
out if you're really interested in a
watch like this so I wanted to make a
favorites video for awhile and throw
this park at princess in and I've hit
pan on my bronzer and my highlighter I
love this stuff I think this is great to
travel with I need to get it again
because I use this highlighter all the
time when I'm not using something else
this bronzer is really great I'm wearing
it right now I don't really wear a lot
of bronzer
unless I'm taking photos or something
but this blush is like the perfect color
and these are all Macs
except for the highlighter of course but
I just had to share this with you guys a
lot of people have been wearing those
choked leather chokers from Vanessa
Muniz so I did pick one up two months
ago and I've been wearing it all the
time like if I go out or just like on a
cute day so this is what it looks like
and you just wrap it around your neck
once or twice and you just tie it
obviously this looks not correct right
now because my hair wavers it was here
this is in the way but you just like tie
it like that and it's so cute thank you
guys so much for taking the time to
watch this video I really hope you
enjoyed it
