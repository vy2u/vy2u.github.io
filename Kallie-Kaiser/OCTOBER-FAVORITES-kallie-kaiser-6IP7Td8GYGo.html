I'm going to doing a favorites just
because I feel like I haven't just sat
down and talked to you guys in so long
so that is what we're going to do today
and if you guys aren't subscribed to my
channel already please subscribe here
and seperated - I'd love to talk to you
guys about some beauty products
jewelry shoes clothes denim what else so
here we go for lip products I have been
obsessed with this over long lasting
liquid lipstick it's in the shade
Versailles I know people have been
having a hard time trying to find this
online so if you ever come across it you
need to buy it i swatch on my hand here
it is just the most beautiful color it's
like a dusty rose Mavi rose color and it
has this amazing metallic sheen to it
it's very pigmented even with just one
swipe it looks so good also the
applicator makes it really easy to apply
and it is a pretty dried formula so it
drives really fast on your lips but it
doesn't dry out my mouth or anything
like that
pretties color looks amazing on any skin
tone and then I have been wearing this
combination for the longest time now
probably like the past two and a half
months this is the Marc Jacobs moody
Margaux nude nudes I think this is one
of their gel lipsticks I love this
because it's not a matte lipstick matte
lipsticks drive my lips a lot and this
is more like a satin or gloss finish I
would say I'm wearing it right now and
then the lip liner I wear underneath it
is the Kylie Jenner exposed liquid
liquid lip liner I really like this
color a lot I think it looks amazing the
only thing is I hate her lip liners they
like fall out like this if you shave
them or sharpen them shave them oh my
gosh I can't speak English I went to
Sephora about a month ago and I was
looking forward to invest in a new
highlighter and as a lady the store
helps me pick this out it is the Laura
Mercier candle lit mineral illuminating
power
this stuff is so insane
it is so pigmented it's just a really
pretty loose powder I wear it as a blush
I have it all right now underneath my
highlighter in between my bronzer just
because I can only really use this as a
highlighter if I'm already tan and I
don't have a spray tan since I'm so pale
it doesn't show up properly on my skin
but I'll swatch it for you guys so if
you just swipe it across your hand right
here it's just so pretty it's just this
really nice illuminating highlighting
it's almost similar to that liquid lip I
just showed you guys I wear it on my
eyes it looks really nice dusted on your
Cupid's bow or just put it on your eyes
over any eyeshadow that you already are
wearing I have it on today to just give
it an extra glam but I think it's a
really pretty color and I'm definitely
wearing it all the time
so I have the kind of Jenner bronze
palette as I'm sure everyone else on the
internet and this earth has bought it as
well just because it took me around four
five times weren't allowed to actually
purchase it I never was able to get it
they would sell out within a minute or
less crazy I love this palette a lot but
the actual color I'm gonna put that it's
just my absolute favorite is this shade
quartz I use it as an everyday
transition shade it's so pretty I would
swatch right now but as you guys can see
a hit pan on it and I don't want to do
because I don't want to just buy another
$45 palettes you get this one color but
I actually think it's just such a pretty
transition shade and then right now
today I'm wearing it with this one that
is called up Sidon
this is hard to read them from the back
to the front just saying but yeah it's
really pretty dark warm coffee color and
I have that pair of this one on the
outer corner in the inner corner but I
just wear this all over my lid no matter
what
I'm doing and I absolutely love it okay
I had to put this in my favorites video
anyone who has not tried this ice cream
you're welcome I just changed your life
so this is the cilenti gelato peanut
butter pretzel flavor no sea salt
caramels also really any of their
flavors are honestly so good I get my
own mold foods I think you can buy them
at Ralph's just depending on where you
live in what your grocery store is I'm
sure they sell it such a popular brand
and it is amazing this is the best ice
cream I've ever ever had mine is the
peanut butter pretzel I eat one of these
a week maybe two every week it's really
bad but this gets you through the week
so you're welcome if any of you guys
follow me on Instagram you probably
already know how obsessed I am with
fishnet tights I basically throw them on
underneath everything and anything I
just picked up a new nude pair at
forever 21 these are so long another why
but once you put them on they fit
perfectly they're still that huge
fishnet design they look amazing on your
jeans skirts long t-shirts and like
black booties and then I got these on
Nasty Gal about a month or two months
ago and I post these on my Instagram way
too much my Instagram is a colonizer if
you guys want to check it out but I
think black looks really good on her
denim as well or any t-shirts like that
so I've just been loving these wearing
these whenever and I think everyone
should have a pair of them since we're
on the topic at fishnets I have these
amazing pair of jeans that I got about a
year and a half ago at that left sale
they're karma and I got up around 28
bucks which is such a steal because now
I think people would be obsessed with
buying these when I bought them I don't
think they were really in style then
they'd have this fishnet design already
sewn into the denim which is really nice
and then just black destroyed all over I
just been wearing these a lot with
really oversized t-shirts long black
sweatshirts etc etc and then I just have
them cuffed at the bottom and they just
look so good and it's super lazy lately
and I just have been wearing sweats
almost ever
they right now I'm actually in sweats as
we speak I got these from the men's
section at Costco they were like $13 but
I got these at Planet Blue about almost
a month ago I want to say two weeks and
I have just been wearing them all the
time I finally just watch them for the
first time I find for them probably 12
or 13 times their camo there that sundry
brand I got them in a size one there a
jogger fit but they're tight so you
don't have to have them baggy in one
area and not in the other I love these I
think they're so cool especially cuz
they're camo and since there are dark
camo design the art to in your face if
that makes sense so I just want to share
these with you guys I like them a lot
and they're super comfortable to talk
about some shoes with you guys I've just
been wearing non-stop I wear these every
single day every day to class anywhere
no matter if I'm fancier casual just
because they look so good with leggings
shorts shorts and tights jeans
I've even worn them with those camo
sweats and they're from Topshop I think
they're The Midnight Rider boots if you
find them or they come out again this
season you have to get these they're of
my favorite shoes I love it they're
appointed Naruto and then the top
leather is super flappy I also own these
in snakeskin but I always go for this
pair just because matte black is my
absolute favorite they just have a
simple zipper in the back and I'm
already wearing up the heel right here
as you guys can see they work top shot
fall and winter flesh and last year so I
don't know if they're online anymore but
they might be a pockmark or something I
absolutely love these I could put them
in every favorites video I'll never get
sick of these another pair of black
boots I've just been wearing all the
time of these two dogs I love them I
like them because they're kind of
and you can wear them with stuff that
they might not match but they look good
together they're that long black matte
design they're in leather they're that
old black brand I got them but the LF
outlet or about last year maybe you're
gonna have to go about now I actually
love them I wear them to class all the
time they're so comfortable I'm on this
path like an ass DL and about August
this is my favorite thing ever I don't
carry purses around anymore this is
basically my child I carry everything I
just love the size of it so good if I
want to throw my camera in there it fits
perfectly and I can take photos during
that day if I wanted to even if I walked
onto the beach I can put my shoes in
here as well which is so convenient but
yeah it's that light Dreamz brand have
silver hardware's I tied a little
handkerchief on here and it hasn't
broken down on me yet so it is totally
my favorite if you guys have ever
watched my videos before you know I'm
obsessed with gold jewellery layering
necklaces so I went on to Fraser
sterling and I picked up this really
awesome star gem necklace you can wear
it at a few different lengths I think it
starts at 14 so you can wear it as a
really tight choker and then it may go
down to 18 I'm not sure as in inches and
then has just all these really pretty
stars dangling around the side of it
that looks like this I was hesitant to
buy it just because it was kind of
expensive and I'm so happy I did it I
wear it all the time it looks so good in
photos so if anyone who's been wondering
where this necklace has been from my
instruments from Fraser sterling as you
guys probably already know Lilly clasp
is my absolute favorite jeweler company
I talk about them in almost every video
or every mall I try and buy a new piece
from them so their winter collection
came out the other day and I am obsessed
with it so I had to order something from
it so this is what I got it's amazing
fringe silver choker oh my gosh I love
we're at different lengths and it just
has this awesome white simple delicate
tool all up and down when you wear it
like this
the best thing ever happened so I order
a lot of Lily clasp actually and I tag
them always in all my photos it's so
cool then they recognise that so when I
ordered this I went up to my mail room
in my apartment building and I picked up
a package and I was like why is that
more than one box in this package I only
ordered one necklace and I opened it up
and there was a card I was like thank
you so much for all your love you show
them really close to me gifted you two
extra pieces from our winter collection
I was so excited so the first piece is
this amazing gold necklace and it's like
a half of the sphere with these really
pretty embellishments on it I think
they're maybe they look so pretty and
then it also sent me a pair of earrings
that match the necklace perfectly they
also have that navy blue gem with the
dots around it oh my gosh they're so
beautiful
I've never bought a pair of neck with a
pair of earrings from the company I
always buy their necklaces so I'm so
happy to try these out yeah I thought
that was just the sweetest thing ever I
always wear this choker it's the LE
choker if there's one where you need in
your life it is this one and then this
is their spot each named choker
so I had to put them in my favorites
video just because it just shows how
sweet they are and I absolutely love
their company and I will continue to buy
jewelry from them and you guys always
ask for my juniors from and it's
probably really class but I don't really
buy from anywhere else but that is all
for my favorites I hope you guys had a
lovely day I love you all so much thank
