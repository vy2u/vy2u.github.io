video we are doing it get ready with me
on this prom look I'm so excited
everything's really double ascription
off I'll be showing my hair and makeup
outfit jewelry shoes and I would love to
go to prom again I'm 20 years old I'm a
sophomore in college so it's just not
going to happen but I'll put pictures of
when I went to prom right here I wore
black dresses Bull beers and so fun so
if anyone are you at prom and we have so
much fun and if you haven't had a
problem hopefully this video will give
you some inspiration if you're lacking
on what you want to wear or how you
wanted your hair makeup I just thought
this was really fun for me I can always
begin this video if you want to follow
me on my Instagram a colonizer so
without further ado here we go for my
primer I'm using the coconut skin
smoothie primer from first a beauty this
stuff's amazing since we're getting
ready for prom all of our makeup will
stay on all night long so it's perfect I
find it best to apply it with my hands I
wash my hands before I do my makeup so
it's no problem and then for our
foundation
this stuff's amazing it blends and it's
so dewy it's the Clinique beyond
perfecting foundation how amazing is
this doe foot applicator I think it
keeps it so clean and sanitary I don't
know if you ask me I love it I would say
this is medium the full-coverage or
definitely just medium coverage it just
depends how much you put on your face
you guys can see there is I'm applying
it super easy I definitely need a new
Beauty Blender but I'm taking my damp
Beauty Blender and you guys can just see
me blending it in on my skin I'm not
going to be adding under-eye concealer
for this look because the foundation has
concealer in it so I just didn't think
it was needed so that's why I'm blending
under my eyes you definitely need a
blended down to the neck as well oh this
is my new favorite it's the hoola kwikki
contour stick it's so creamy
it's the perfect bronze shade I think it
will go with a lot of skin tones you
guys can just see how easy it is to
apply and I don't even let it dry just
take my Beauty Blender and blend it out
as you guys can see it's not wiping away
any of the foundation underneath it's
just giving my face a little bit more
shaping with the color
I think it's so beautiful Wow looks so
good okay and then I'm taking my Laura
Mercier translucent powder I don't set
my entire face I only set under my eyes
around my nose and then my chin and
forehead area so I'm not setting on top
of our bronzer quickie stick that we use
the cream bronzer what I'm going to set
that with is this matchbox contour kit
I'm taking the shade on the left and as
you guys can see I'm just patting it
into my skin so since we didn't set the
cream bronzer before I don't want to
wipe any of it away so that's why I'm
patting it into my skin it works best
for me whatever works best for you it's
really fine I also contour my nose a
little bit and I add some under my lip
if you don't own this you need to buy
it's a glossy Aboy brow I wear the shade
blonde
I have tried so many different brow
products and everything and this holds
my brows so well you don't even need to
add chapstick on top of it or another
gel primer so amazing so you guys can
just see it adds the perfect color I use
my kit cosmetics brow power to just fill
in any areas that were kind of spacious
I don't know someone else in the Collins
pointed this out to me and I started
doing it it looks so much better and
then I take this amazing little palette
for my cosmetics I dip into the lightest
highlighter shade in this and I'm just
studying the eye primer that we use
which was the first day Beauty coconut
primer we're just setting that on the
eyelids and then going in with our pea
for Natasha janata palette this is my
new favorite palette the colors are so
creamy and we're using this really
shimmery transition shade it's so
beautiful it's just a really neutral
champagne e color you guys can just see
I'm using a tapered blending brush this
one is from it cosmetics and then we are
going in with our violet Voss x Laura
Lee palette and I want to add some
warmth to that transition shade that we
just put on so I'm taking Priss pot and
you guys can kind of see the warmth
coming through with that champagne color
that we mixed in you can do this messily
it's such a light shade it's not going
to mess up the eye look or anything and
then this is an amazing burnt coral
color to Morocco by makeup geek I love
their single eyeshadows
and I'm just taking a more compact
tapered blending brush I think it's for
morphe brushes and you guys going to see
I'm only adding this to my inner corner
and outer corner have you've watched any
of my makeup tutorials before you've
seen me do this to my eyes I think it
personally just widens my eyes and adds
more dimension to my face in general and
looks so good you have to try it
and since it's prom I wanted to add more
dimension to the eye so I'm mixing 1988
in rammer jammer on a more precise
eyeshadow brush you guys can just see
we're darkening up the crease on the
outer corner with this look and then I
kind of add a little bit of shading to
the inner corner I love warm colors on
the eyes so if you're not a warm color
person I swear if you try it you will
never go back to cool tone colors
another trick I do to make the look more
glam as I take mac fix+ on my sephora
fan brush and I just sweep this over my
eyes you guys can see how much it makes
a difference when you add highlighters
your eyes like that so cool Kylie
cosmetics copperpot this is amazing I'm
just taking this right on my finger I
wipe it on my hand first so it's not so
bright if that makes sense and we're
just patting this in the middle where we
did not put a lot of eyeshadow and I
just blend it in I think it just adds
the perfect pop of color next to the
coral colors it's so pretty
then we're taking pressed pot eye we're
putting that underneath our lower lash
line before we add some of the other
warm colors with this I'm going back and
trying to oxygen on a pallet and taking
this really beautiful rose color and I
kind of messed up right there but I'm
just moving this under my lower lash
line kind of from the outer corner into
the middle about my pupil you can see
and then this is the best inner corner
highlight shade ever you will see the
pop of highlight and obsess
taking this really nice gold color we're
also going to be putting that underneath
our lower lash line kind of towards the
inner corner of the eye and the water
duct or tear doctor whatever it's called
and I'm just taking a brush to wipe away
any glittery eye shadow since we did do
our foundation first that is the
finished look for the eye shadow moving
back to our face this is one of the best
bronzers I've ever used it's the Marc
Jacobs tantrik bronzers since our eyes
are so warm I really just wanted to warm
up the face a little bit more since we
only did the cream bronzer and then I
just put a really cool toned contour
shade over it so this is just warming up
our face a little bit more this is my
new favorite thing it's a cosmetics it's
just amazing little palette and it comes
with it's awesome brush I never wear
blush but these colors mixed together
add the perfect amount of warmth to the
apples of my cheeks as you guys can see
and then this is the best highlighter
ever it's by over cosmetics it's rodeo
drive you will just see how yet blinding
blinding I love adding highlighter to my
eyes i overdo it hardcore it's so fine
because when I went to prom and stuff
they didn't even add highlighters my
face when I got my makeup done it
benefit so it's so funny that
highlighter is now taking over the world
okay and then I also love to add a
little bit to my chin and I add some to
my lips as well you can totally just
rock no lipstick with this look and just
add a highlighter it looks amazing
but I will be putting a nudie gel-like
lipstick on top of this so it's just a
really nice undertone to have this is
the Marc Jacobs gel lipstick it's in the
shade moody Margaux so great so easy to
apply and your lips are being
moisturized at the same time so they
won't feel super dry when you're taking
pictures and you're smiling at
in your jaw hurts and this is my benefit
roller lash I'm only putting this on my
lower lashes as I do have eyelash
extensions if you have any questions
about eyelash extensions I'll ask them
down I'll answer them down below I love
them so much though
to set my faces I don't have settings
free right now I'm just using this mac
fix+ it makes to look even more dewy and
you guys can see I love how the eyes
look wet here but I didn't add any
additional cream or greasy product it's
strictly highlighter and eye shadows and
I think it looks so good so I love to
add some glam glow glow starter to my
body it depends on what kind of dress
you have my dress shows a little bit on
my collarbone and shoulders if I want it
to so this just adds the perfect glow
and then I like to set that with the mac
fix+ highlight everything looks amazing
and moving on to our hair this is such a
favorite part of mine I am going to just
be brushing on my hair you need a wet
brush if you do not own one and this is
the best dry shampoo personally I think
it's also good I wash my hair last night
not today so I think it's best to not
have to super clean hair you want dirty
hair if you are getting your hair done
or you're doing it yourself and I kind
of just brushed that into my hair pretty
explanatory I don't know what else to
say
picking my bed head do a waver I love
this I've had it for seven years now I
love a full head of crimped hair if any
of you guys have naturally crimped hair
you are so lucky
you can see how easy this is this tool
heats up super fast and it gets really
hot too so it doesn't take too long
crimp your hair I'm creaming my hair
because why the hell not
how many people do you think is going to
have their hair crimped at prom exactly
you won't be the only one with your hair
style so you can just see how the
luminous and fun this looks I love
ponytails so we're just going to do a
little bit of a classic ponytail leaving
some hair out in front of our face near
our eyes just to frame the face and it
will look good for pictures
I like to add a ribbon I wanted to make
it a little bit more feminine because my
dress is white lace but that is it from
the hair and makeup I love it far as my
outfit goes my earrings came in one
pastor from Free People I'll link them
down below and my chokers are from Lili
class one of my favorite to their
companies ever I thought it looks so
good with the makeup I love gold jewelry
as well and my dress is from the brand
skycap I got in a boutique but you can
definitely find skycap on resolve I'll
try and find it and link down below for
you guys and my shoes are from Free
People
