we are doing is super real no makeup
makeup look we are not using any
foundation throughout this entire video
I'm really excited to show you guys what
I'm just really loving lately is perfect
for summer so it's gonna follow me on my
Instagram is at Cali tiser without
further ado here we go okay so I have
nothing but moisturizer on my face right
now and so I do have a few pimples right
here going on I possibly to the other
day and literally they are healing so
quickly because I used the oil
Henriksen all entrances and horrible at
pronouncing stuff the truth serum holy
crap this stuff is amazing I just like
your little squirt spread it around and
it completely heals my temple that I
coughed or pimples that I don't pop you
know you know the drill starting off
this makeup look we're taking a small
staff of the Wonder glow instant
soft-spoken CD flash primary by
Charlotte Tilbury everything guys can
see but so pretty it has like hint of
highlighter in it and we're springing
this on me you can only see that below I
salute how natural this is an it's truly
on I love it
this product is the star of the show
this is going to act as our foundation
so this is the tiger grass color
correcting treatments by dr. jart holy
cow it's amazing so when it oxidizes it
literally goes to your skin tone it's
color correcting so it starts off green
and SPF 38 in a little really does go a
long way so I'm just going to show you a
time apply this you guys are going to
literally slip out when you see this
active foundation so do you see all this
redness on my face it's not going to be
there in a second
you don't have to give it a minute to
work to
so we're just rubbing this in the skin
okay so as you guys can see right now I
only not put this on half my face this
is the trio side and this side still has
redness as I haven't put the color
correcting moisturizer on Paul are you
obsessed it's just so easy to put on
they sell it at Sephora if anyone's
wondering otherwise I'll have it linked
down below but it's absolutely lifesaver
I think everyone eats oh this is just so
perfect for summer I hate putting on
foundation when I'm going around errands
and stuff and not that I wear makeup
every single day um but you know here
what if you guys are friends you want to
take some pics you kind of want to sell
makeup on okay here's what it looks like
all blended in and I'm not wearing any
foundation and literally almost probably
80% of my redness on my skin is
completely disappeared so it's amazing I
definitely check it out but for uh I
really just need to show you guys how
many was what
so next I'm taking the hoola kwikki
contour stick I love this wow it's a
benefit and we're just going to be
adding some warmth to our face with it
okay then I picked this a bus before
because I've seen everyone you didn't I
honestly will it so much as an amazing
texture compared to a beauty blender
once we blend that out
it just has created these beautiful
natural shadows and our cheekbones which
i think is the perfect amount of warmth
for our eyebrows today I am taking my
glossy egg boy brow and I have this in
the shade blonde week how am i set this
product is just so simple to throw on my
eyebrows and they look super filled in
and nice
and when we taking my setting brush and
since I have that moisturizer on my lids
I'm just taking the laura mercier
translucent powder just setting my lid
and like anywhere else you find yourself
too shiny
then I am just taking this morphe t27
brush and I'm dipping it into my
candlelight illuminating powder from
Laura Mercier capping off any excess and
it's putting this in my crease I think
it's a really pretty warm light pink
shades and shimmers in it and this is
pretty much all I'm going to be doing to
my eyes I will probably go over with
highlighter as well and then next I'm
going to be going in with this really
pretty product that I recently picked up
it's the Marc Jacobs do you do drops so
I'm just putting a little bit on the
back of my hand
this stuff is oh that's still way too
much so I'm just going to be kind of
going in with my finger
usually careful because this stuff is
intense so I'm just putting that on my
finger and it gives the most beautiful
dewy natural highlight hope you can see
so pretty and I'm also adding some of my
nose and Cupid's bow right honestly so
pretty I hope you can see it and then I
do like to take a little bit of bronzer
so I'm taking my benefit hoola light on
line morphe and five to seven brush just
dipping in a relief a little bit of
every artist I can add a little bit of
bronzer
even though yes no makeup but grounders
essential in life then for lip products
I like to use either my Dior lip glow
color renewal in the shade go one in the
shade pink this stuff is amazing it
smells so good so I'm going to put this
on first and then I like to take my Dior
lip Maximizer and this is the prettiest
lip gloss ever it's in the base shade
0:06
and we're just adding this on top so
beyond beautiful and then I'm taking my
issue a highlighter in the shade skinny
dip look how beautiful this is on a
morphine and 5-10 brush and I'm just
putting this on my eyes to make them
glow a little bit more okay and then
that is the completed look it's so
simple so easy and I didn't even use
that many products so everything will be
