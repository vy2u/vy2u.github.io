my door from the hallway and walk into
my bedroom my bedroom looks very plain
just a heads up in this video also sorry
if there's any weird focusing or
autofocus malfunctions throughout the
rest of this video but my room is just a
square or a box you could say if we
start with my closet I do have a walk-in
closet
on the top shelf
I just keep backpacks mostly all my
heels are up there and then right
underneath that I keep all of my crop
tops and skirt
mostly summer shirts they all hang above
this brown dresser that I keep in there
that probably just has like swimsuits
and sweatshirts and stuff on the bottom
there's just shoes above that I keep my
triangle swimsuits and then above that
are my sunglasses and I keep all of my
shorts and jeans piled up in this crate
right next to that is just going to be
some sweaters or rubbers or just dresses
some winter coats if we walk out of my
closet it's just gonna be this really
cute IKEA picture frame thing that I
actually got from Ikea
it just holds all of my Polaroids or
Instagram cutouts that I printed off my
computer I love this it's such a cute
accent to my room right next to that is
going to be my nightstand
I love having fresh flowers in my room
they just brighten up everything
honestly this nightstand is from Target
it was under $20 I think right behind a
is gonna be this really cute mirror that
I have in my room
this piece of my timer actually don't
know where this near is from my mom is
an interior designer and shh-shh got it
from something that she used to do and
then she painted it silver really turned
out really cute and then my nightstand
is right here for my nightstand it is
going to be from Ikea it is in the mom
collection I believe I could be wrong
now it's just a two drawer that slides
open
I love having open candles in my room
and then there's this really cute lamp
that sits right above my nightstand and
it is from Ikea as well next to my
nightstand is going to be my bed and
then at the very end of my bed I have
this black ottoman that I got at
HomeGoods my bed sheets and duvet are
from Urban Outfitters as well as the
pillows that you will see on my bed and
then at the very end of my bed I keep
these really cute like faux fur fuzzy
blankets I love them when I get cold in
the middle of the night they are from
Pier one Imports and the best part about
my bed is that the duvet is reversible
so you can just switch it whatever
you're feeling right across my bed is
going to be my favorite thing in my
entire room this is my wardrobe on the
first drawer that you can open is going
to be my makeup and then shoes on the
bottom shelf here's just a closer look
into my makeup shelf it's gonna be like
my brushes perfumes lipsticks stuff like
that

the rest of my heels that I keep on the
next shelf or door that opens up I keep
my black and white clothes and then my
color clothes are folded behind there I
have my unmentionables and socks and
then on the very bottom opened up I have
my pajamas and t-shirts and sweatshirts
and then on the very top I'm gonna have
some like sweatshirts beanies and hats
that I keep up there now if I open up
the main section I just keep mostly all
of my nicer clothes and then black boots
at the bottom so as you guys can tell
this is probably my favorite thing my
entire room is from Ikea as you guys can
