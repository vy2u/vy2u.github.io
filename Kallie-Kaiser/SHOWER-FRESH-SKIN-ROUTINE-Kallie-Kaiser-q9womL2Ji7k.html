to be doing a shower and skincare
routine and then there's some haircare
at the end so obviously to start off I
just hop in the shower it was freezing I
always do this where I turn it on so
cold but obviously I just get my body
and hair wet to start off and I reach
right for my shampoo conditioner I get
these two at Costco they're the Kirkland
brand they're really hydrating for my
hair which I absolutely love so when I
shampoo I start from the top of my head
and I really massage my fingers into my
scalp to get out any oils that are
making my hair look greasy stuff like
that I really lather it up once the
shampoo is all rinsed off I take a huge
dollop of conditioner I don't know if
this is just me but I have always used
so much conditioner and for the
conditioning treatment I'm mostly just
focuses towards the end of my hair
because I'm really dry and stay in the
hair so I find that it the ends are most
fragile and they need to be absorbed
with lots of conditioner and after that
I'll just soak up my entire head and let
it sit on the top in a crazy ball like
that and I'll get everything else done
in the world that I need to in the
shower I'll shave my armpit shave my
legs and I also wash my body during this
time I'm using It's Raining Men by lush
cosmetics wow this stuff is so nice it's
so hydrating and moisturizing for my
skin which is so great because I have
pretty dry skin and it smells really
good and has honey in it as well
after I just rinsed at all I'm going to
rinse out my conditioner in my hair as
well I usually leave my conditioner in
for about five to seven minutes it
depends on how quick the shower cream
after that I'm just going in with like
glossier and milky cleanser this is
softest face wash I've ever used my life
I just started using it this past week
and I already love it definitely gets
the gunk out and any excess makeup that
you have on your face which is exactly
what I needed the next class is amazing
if you're not trying to put lotion on
after the shower so this is from lush
cosmetics it is the rose Argan body
conditioner it's basically how it sounds
it is a skin conditioner and it's so
nice I've only used this one time before
and I am absolutely obsessed with it
already so I just take a glob on my
hands and I just rub it all over my body
it's really smooth when you rub it in
and then when you wash it off with the
water it leaves kind of a waxy finish on
your skin so you just want to dab it off
or dry yourself off as a towel whenever
you're done but as you guys can see the
water drops are kind of sticking to my
shoulders and arms and it just leaves
your skin super moisturized and hydrated
so I didn't even have to use lotion once
I got out but this is all I do in the
shower those are all the products I
usually use and then I do switch off
with exfoliator and stuff but we only
were using a cleanser today so I'll just
reach for my towel and I'll dry my hair
and body off
once my body's all dry all's put my hair
up in the towel and let it soak and I
move over to where I keep all my
skincare and lotions and haircare
products I just put it on top of this
shelf I got at Target so the first thing
is deodorant I got this deodorants the
fourth amazing it's called the healthy -
you're on it and when I open it it was
broken I was so upset and you can see
but you made it work and slips it back
and I ended up being able to fit someone
but after that I reach for this toner
water this is also from less cosmetics
it's called aroma water it's amazing I
love this and I just spray this all over
my face
I made Ansel motion because I thought it
was more dramatic after that I'll reach
for this glossy a serum it's called
super glue and this stuff is amazing I
just do a few droplets on my fingertips
kind of rub that between my fingers and
disperse it evenly and I'll just Pat
that into my skin I find that's what it
works best and it kind of just gives
your face a little extra glow and after
I put that back I reach for my
moisturizer I use the same moisturizer
every day it's called on da luz the skin
brightening and probiotics C's
moisturizer I get this out Whole Foods
it is one of my favorite moisturizer
ever because I really sensitive skin and
it doesn't have a really strong scent
I'm huge on sense
everything has to smell like warm
buttery or clean and fresh I hate for
new smells so I love the way this smells
and after I just put that back
I'll reach her my lip balm from glam low
this is the best chapstick ever it's
called wet lip also you can just see me
filly on the camera right there
but I just put this on and after I'll
show you guys some haircare products I
use once I take my hair out of the towel
so I just reach for my O&amp;amp;M this stuff is
amazing it's called no not I don't
really have tangly hair but it just adds
extra hydration to my hair which is
exactly what I need and this scent
smells like the ocean like salt water so
so clean and fresh and then I use a wet
brush to brush my hair out
I've heard it's better to brush your
hair bottom to top so that's just what I
do and I brush my hair when it's wet I
don't notice any severe breakage my hair
is better when I brush it when it's wet
and after that I'll reach for some oil
this is the I don't even know how to
pronounce it mark to mark I don't know
but I love this oil I got it in a
fabfitfun box in the spring and I've
been using it ever since
I just worked this in the ends of my
hair and I barely put any on the top but
whatever is left on my hands I'll work
it into the top of my hair and after
that I'm just gonna let air dry that is
basically what helps my hair grow super
long and I don't actually unless I need
to some go to an event or anything like
that like filming and after that I'm not
doing anything right now so I'll just go
my computer while my hair air-dry hang
out my bed go on computer edit some
videos or spawning read comments but
that is all for today's video I love you
guys and thank you so much for watching
