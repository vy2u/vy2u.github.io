I'm so excited because I am filming a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A I put on my story filming a
snapchat Q&amp;amp;A send me videos of your
questions and I am overwhelmed on how
many people actually send me videos and
stuff I don't know if you guys can see
this but oh my gosh I love you all so
much and I can't wait oh there we go it
ended and I can't wait to respond to
your guys questions so here we go okay I
didn't know I press that okay that was
Alexa Allah Alex Brooke and she asked me
what my favorite clothing item is shoes
shoes 100% okay this is a video from
violet Hana valeton I don't know if I'm
pronouncing her name oh wow you are
beautiful oh my gosh
okay um also I love your accents super
super beautiful girl long-distance
relationships are very tough it depends
who you are in a person as a person and
how you guys are together Haven I knew
we were going to stay together when we
went away to college we've been dating
for about a year in two months now and
I'm so sad we have to do another year a
long distance away because he's going to
school in Arizona and I'll be in
California but we're only seven hour
drive but how we dealt with that we
really just made time for each other on
FaceTime phone calling he also spent
money and visited me three times on a
plane so I'm so grateful for that and
that was really nice it's just the
physical miss like physical touch like
you can't hug them you can't say hello
with a kiss or that's the only
frustrating it's very it's just
frustrating and that's the hardest part
to get through but yeah we got through
it no problem and we're still together
and I love
so much this is from Libra that I don't
know if I'm pronouncing your name right
I love okay yes I'm so happy you watched
my recent haul I did get a new pair of
red booties and I would definitely pair
those with denim I think that it looks
really other threads anything ripped I
would definitely wear those with shorts
a skirt super cool ripped jeans
otherwise you gonna dress I love wearing
stuff that doesn't match but it matches
at the same time that makes sense so I
could even wear those red booties with a
yellow dress and it doesn't really match
but it does you can incorporate it with
jewelry and stuff I don't know I hope I
answered that question right okay this
is from Reagan Reed
okay this is such a good question also
you're so keen I love the dog emoji
filter and snapchat as well so many
people ask me where's my river routine
so all summer long I haven't worked out
which is two months I've only ridden my
bike a few times I rode my bike that's
the proper grammar walked my dog ran
with my dog I really haven't done any
rigorous training for working out I
really wanted to I just I'm not with the
gym right now at home being at U of A
the rec center was amazing and I worked
out their first semester really intense
like four times a week sometimes and
then second sister I kind of fell out
from that and I worked out once a week
maybe not even maybe I'd work out twice
every two weeks something like that just
call it caught up and friends and social
life so I don't have a workout routine
to give you guys right now but I
definitely will have one within the next
three months because I'm trying to get
back into working out when I moved to
California so we'll have one for you
then and I'm so sorry about the delay
and then I just eat healthy as well um
but I definitely want to try and stay
back in shape because I'm losing all my
toning that was on my body and then far
as confidence I it's weird because I
don't even consider myself as a very
confident person
I just live the way I live and I don't
care what anyone thinks about me I don't
think anyone in this world has a right
to judge you as who you are as a person
I think everyone is so awesome so
beautiful and people should just do
whatever the hell they want you should
never feel judged or hat there's no
reason anyone should ever feel insecure
because you have to understand that you
have the look that you have and no one
else looks like you and that is so cool
that no one looks like you
I just think that's so cool and you are
the person you are because there is no
what if I look like this what if I did
this what if I had this that's not it
because you are who you are and you
should be confidence with whatever you
have who you are and what you have to
give and it really shows because it's
weird because I believe you think
confident I just don't care so I hope
that was some advice for you okay this
is a video from Kendall Reppert let me
through
oh my gosh I love your freckles they're
so cute okay I get my fashion
inspiration from this is hard because I
look at a lot of festival type clothing
and I want to imitate that just mostly
from people around me but if we're
talking celebrities I love and Watson
style Blake Lively style beautiful Nina
Gomez there's a Victoria's Secret model
with love her style her name is rum MAME
I don't know I love the way Bella Thorne
dresses cuz she's kind of funky
Sonja Eastman I love her style she's
super dope she's here on youtube as well
it really just depends on my outfit and
then darn it I don't remember the other
question who is my make my fashion
inspiration from I'm sorry I can't
replay it I used all my replays today so
I can't
I don't can't go back but I hope
hopefully that answered your question
for you I am 5 3 ok this snapchat is
from almería I'm just so bad at
pronouncing video so I'm just gonna open
it favorite clothing brand ok flavor
clothing brand this is so hard for love
and lemons probably I love for loving
lemons
she also asked me my favorite swimwear
brand mmm I would have to say lolly swim
I love well as one and our suits just
fit me really good oh my gosh oh my gosh
there's so many I don't never felt your
name of course oh it feels so awkward I
don't know why
okay what do you send at your videos I
use iMovie I really want to get Final
Cut Pro my parents are talking about it
made for my birthday present but I am
way too broke to even buy for myself so
hopefully I get from everything oh my
house money - this is where I'm at
Caroline and my favorite thing about
Hubei is being - is being able to wake
up stare out my window and there would
be mountains outside my window every
morning when I would wake up and then I
would go to class let's say from 9:00 to
noon and then I get off and I'm walking
the streets looking up pollen trees
every day or I would just go get food to
my friends and we would hang out go to
parties go out like it was a dream
Nueve was amazing and I had the best day
of my life there if you did that you
were going there you were so lucky and
you're gonna have the greatest year of
your life hopefully you Wragge because
Greek life is amazing I didn't think I
was very much of a sorority girl and
then I joined it and I was like and then
I loved it and I would do anything for
my sorority or my sisters that are in it
and I had the best year my gosh I'm so
jealous okay
wow this is a good question so I really
want to use my YouTube channel as a
platform for something in the
entertainment business I did go to U of
A and I studied theater arts acting
program but I was only in there be a not
the BFA prestigious training program
because I wanted more time to contribute
to my YouTube channel and school at the
same time um I love acting I think it's
so cool otherwise if Petite modeling
ever comes into play that'd be awesome
because I am five three so I can't model
the way I want so I do freelance
modeling right now um really anything
you entertainment business having to do
with camera Media TV and film I love all
of that stuff okay this is from khlo I
think it's close
okay this is such a good question also I
love your name okay I would definitely
say Mykonos Greece Australia and I
really want to go to Japan really bad I
think it's so cool there or Tokyo
probably Tokyo oh my gosh that'd be so
cool and this is from hey Williams
oh my gosh you from Elmhurst I go to
Elmhurst all the time because my grandma
lives somewhere over there and they
drive to her house okay hey Haley what's
up you're so cute oh my gosh I have
lived in Chicago since I was born I was
born here in Chicago I lived in wheat in
until I was three and then we moved and
we lived in the house I live in now for
I think 8 or 16 years 16 years or 17
years something like that okay this
person asked me why have you decided to
do in YouTube this is from Babu I'm love
I'm bad pronouncing these names so I've
started to YouTube because I took a year
off from high school to college and I
was bored but I didn't know YouTube was
a thing so I my first video was me
reviewing a triangle swimwear bikini and
they were hundred dollars at the time I
think they still are that expensive and
I was wounded by one of them money and I
didn't know a size to get so I was
looking up reviews or people that grow
on their blog posts and stuff like that
but not one person in YouTube channel
tried on the bikini so I was so
frustrated so I wanted to make a review
so that people could see me trying to
bikini on and then they could compare
their body type to mine and then they
would know what size to get so then that
video got a bunch of views and people
are like you should make more videos
continue with your channel
I like the way you talk or bola
something like that it's really nice and
then I started watching Lauren Elizabeth
and jennxpenn on YouTube and Claudia
Saluki and I was like what YouTube is
says thing so then I took my mom's
camera and I started filming more videos
every single week and now it's become
something I could call a job soon and
it's so exciting and these that this
platform is still amazing so if you're
ever considering trying to start a
YouTube channel the time is now or it
was at least a year ago okay Olivia and
asked me how do I fit in
you don't you're not supposed to know
we're doing that's a really good
question you're not supposed to fit in I
personally don't think so I haven't fit
in my entire life
anyone you asked I am the weirdest
person you will ever meet in your entire
life anyone that knows me can abide by
that um but I'm not saying like weird is
bad or anything it's just you're not
supposed to fit in I mean no that's not
even a thing like there's people that
fit in and there's people that don't I
just think there's nothing that doesn't
exist there is no high don't fit in high
I do fit in everyone is the same to me
but this is such a funny question if you
don't fit in okay someone asked love you
what high love you use oh my gosh I love
you too and it's the highlighter they're
wearing right now I'll go grab these
so the highlighter that I have been
using is by sleek makeup and I use this
shade right here it is amazing I'll
swatch it for you guys I don't know if
you guys can see that you see it it's I
don't know it's just super beautiful I
saw this because Jaclyn hill hi Manny
Manny anyway had it so many people got
this Alice so I bought on Amazon
and I do not regret this purchase okay
Maddie was 21 asks me what are your
favorite colors to wear when doing the
photo shoots this is such a good
question I would have to say white looks
really good or an off-white or cream or
taupe color on that photographs really
well
any it depends if I have a spray tan or
not I have a spray tan grays and blues
look really really nice on camera
um I don't know anything that matches my
hair color or my eye color looks really
nice it just depends what I'm wearing
what kind of makeup I'm going with that
day I don't know what's really a
question though
