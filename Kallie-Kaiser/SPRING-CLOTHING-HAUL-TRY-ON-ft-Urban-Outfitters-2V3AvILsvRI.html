we are doing a mini haul everything I'm
going to be showing you guys is from
Urban Outfitters
I love Urban Outfitters I've shopped in
stores online in their sales section for
the longest time ever and I still do I
have amazing spring pieces to share with
you guys including maxi dresses swim
stuff so without further ado I would
love to be in this video and here we go
this is probably my favorite thing I've
ever owned in my entire life it's this
amazing black and white two-tone denim
jacket over here we have white matt
buttons
it's guest you can only get this Urban
Outfitters and it's on sale right now it
is amazing mine is in the size small I
just bought this for my sister the other
day too just because she was drooling
over mine on a letter Barbara and she
just had to happen oh is Roble is this
ruched - job - size extra small small
obviously is from Urban Affairs as well
it's just all black has this amazing
cinching going on it is so flattering
with high-waisted denim I'm in love this
top is the perfect spring off the
shoulder top
obviously it's from Urban Outfitters as
well it's all white and it kind of has a
linen gaudy material it's super thick
and beautiful you don't have to remember
all underneath this because the
materials so thick it won't show through
how it were these ties I love when
clothing is color-block so I had to have
this Stila sweatshirt it's just white
blue this would be soft it's wet your
material I've ever felt in my entire
length this is size medium if you do
want it to be an oversized look
depending on your body type I definitely
wish it out sized large but that's just
your preference how amazing is this tube
one-piece swimming and has this gorgeous
gold ladder going on right here I love
this I got so many compliments when I
wore this in Mexico and it's just this
awesome rust color looks so good every
skin tone I live in these shoes they are
amazing I got them on I read Outfitters
as well I wear size 6 they're just the
classic skinny slim fit van high tops
and they are beautiful I don't know what
else to say about these shoes if you own
them you know how obsessed you are with
them if you don't own them you need to
own I wore this on spring break in
Mexico as well it's just the most
gorgeous maxi dress ever it has an
entire
we open back super comfortable in the
treks area no matter what size boobs you
have it's just super flowy and this
amazing green and white color this is
just an amazing spaghetti strap perfect
spring maxi silky dress it almost looks
like the color highlighter in it it's
just so beautiful the sheen to it I saw
this in Urban Outfitters in the store
and I was like I'm leaning to omen
this piece right here is probably the
most extra thing I know in my closet I
just have it it is this Juicy Couture
jumper it's connected I know I don't
know what I was thinking it's amazing
though it's all red and velvet has this
awesome silver hardware and ducek stores
coming back I got this in a size extra
small I love jumpsuits
this is an amazing white pant leg
jumpsuit and it kind of has some fun
bootcut bottoms mine is in a size zero
with the super white thick straps this
is so flattering on the body and it goes
with every single skin tone I love this
of course I love the yellow glasses
trend which so many of you guys have
asked me where these glasses are from
they're from Urban Outfitters
they're amazing I'll link them down
below they also have a really great
bandana let's grab this black one and it
kind of has a white veiny pattern going
on or texture it's kind of a marble
texture I believe I love this I just
wore this to Coachella and it looks so
good with all my outfit how unreal is
this sure I got in the men's section
it's stuffy it's from Urban Outfitters
and it just has this girl with pink hair
and yellow lipstick saying stuffy and it
says California also I've been living in
this yellow color lately I always wanted
to own a pair of these fishnet socks I'm
so happy I you know how a mini they are
being I don't know what shoes you
everything's I wonder if I could wear
them with camo and Liz is that a thing
in the summertime in springtime I love
just pairing an oversized t-shirt with
shorts and I'm really excited to wear
these with really cool shoes that I have
I'll show you guys in the trying portion
and it just has this little dagger right
I'm not supporting knives on shirts or
anything I love this and I got my own
size

totally will but I hope you guys have a
lovely day I'm so excited that it's
