because this video is in collaboration
with Sephora collection to show you guys
my kind of go-to gorgeous spring glam
makeup look so thank you so much to
Sephora collection for sponsoring this
video I will be showing all of you
beautiful people step-by-step
instructions on how I achieve this
makeup look so if you would like to know
then just keep on watching but the
centerpiece of this makeup look is going
to be Sephora collection scream lip
stain I am wearing the shade infinite
rose oh five on my lips right now I am
obsessed they just launched their shade
range from 40 shades to 90 shades I
think that is so cool that they have
such a large diverse range of color and
there really is going to be a shade or
two for everybody
also this formula is so long-lasting it
is literally pizza proof donut proof
chai latte with almond milk proof
because that's my favorite it's also
only 14 US dollars so I'm really excited
to get in this look and don't forget
that you guys can get this cream lip
stain at Sephora calm in stores and on
the app okay let's get into this video
here we go starting to make a tutorial
I'm wearing nothing but moisturizer on
my face I'm going to be taking the YSL
primer how gorgeous is this packaging
there's literally gold flakes just
chilling inside the bottle I love this
primary works up with a lot of my
foundations for my foundation today I'm
using the Dior forever love this stuff
used it literally all of last summer so
I'm really excited to wear it again for
spring and summer seasons it's just so
gorgeous I don't love full coverage
foundations on my skin so I love what
this does because I don't have to set it
and then taking my under-eye concealer
I'm going to be using the Born This Way
to face time in the shade very fair I
also love this packaging so I'm just
taking a little bit putting it
underneath my eye and I just blend it
out with a Beauty Blender whatever is
left on my Beauty Blender I also
highlight the top of my nose and
forehead
oh I'm obsessed with these if you've
watched any of my makeup tutorials in
the past you know how much I love these
Fenty Beauty contour sticks but they are
they're so good okay so here's the shade
amber and
I usually just use the portable brush
that comes with it it blends out so
flawlessly and looks so natural I'm in
love with it so of course I have to
throw it in here highlighter today I'm
using the benefit high beam I just
started using this I just put a little
on the back of my hand take my damp
Beauty Blender and how gorgeous and
natural is that highlight I'm so
obsessed with it and then I kind of just
worked that on my face for my eyebrows
I'm just going to be using the two-faced
brow pencil I'm obsessed with it it's
super easy because you can just
literally draw lines and your eyebrows
and I'm not very good at filling in so
this works and then for our bronzer
today I'm taking the two-faced unicorn
tears how gorgeous is this there is a
sparkly unicorn inside the bronzer okay
I'm contouring my face a little bit with
that as well just using the Sephora two
ended brush for blush today and taking
this gorgeous NARS liquid brush I've
been actually obsessed with this color
lately just because it brings a lot of
warmth to my face okay moving on to my
favorite part of this look I'm going to
be taking the Sephora collection cream
lip stain first I'm going to be using
the shade oh five infinite rose and then
for kind of like a really pretty inner
lip highlight I'm going to be dabbing
the color pink lollipop 109 on my lips
and guys these new shades are from
numbers 46 to 105 the stain comes in
matte satin and now metallic finishes
they have such a wide range of richly
pigmented colors you guys are gonna be
obsessed so I'm just gonna be showing
you guys here how this really high
coverage lip color just glides on so
smooth and then literally transforms
from this creamy texture to this
gorgeous silky lightweight stain I love
it so much because it never gets sticky
so my hair is never caught in my lips
and it doesn't dry out my lip and I just
love a really good silky long-lasting
lip stain that I know is going to keep
my lips covered from a.m. to p.m.
there's no need to reapply or touch up
throughout the day that's why I'm so
obsessed also how gorgeous is the
Stane for our eye makeup today I am in
love with these two palettes so the
first one is crystal drama by Bobby
Brown and then the second one is the Too
Faced life's a festival palette these
look amazing together and then for the
brushes you can just find these at
Sephora before I add a shadow I always
like to pack on a really bright or
whitening powder from any eyeshadow
palette that you have just to set the
foundation and then this is a great
transition shade it's just from the
crystal drama palette from Bobbi Brown
I'm just blending that into my crease
with a tapered a blending brush then
taking Sunset dream on a more precise
tapered blending brush I'm brushing this
only into my inner corner and outer
corner kind of having a hollow effect
because we're gonna be putting a really
pretty metallic glow color right on the
middle of the lid and then I'm just
gonna dust this really nice transition
shade under the eye for the middle of
the lid I'm going to taking
fun-in-the-sun from life's a festival
palette how gorgeous is this dual chrome
metallic shadow I'm in love with it I'm
definitely gonna be wearing it all
spring and summer there's a lot of
shades that are in this palette that you
could totally put in the middle of your
lid like this and it looks amazing then
I'm taking this gorgeous sparkly silver
shade and just using it as the inner
corner highlight and it's from the
crystal drama palette and then for
mascara this is just from Bobbi Brown as
well this is actually my first time
using the mascara in this tutorial
because I couldn't find my Too Faced
better than sex one but I'm really
impressed with it and I really loved it
okay and then to finish up the makeup
look I'm just taking the Too Faced
hangover 3 in one setting mist or you
can use it as a primer but after that
and that is because
we didn't look I hope you guys loved it
I thought it was really spring inspired
thank you guys so much for taking the
time to watch this video I hope you
loved this look don't forget to open up

collection on Sephora collection of
