I filmed a spring get ready with me just
this really dewy kind of natural bronze
makeup look and then a lot of you guys
have been asking where am i new clothes
and jewelry is from so I will make sure
to link it all down below in the
description box for you guys but if you
want to know how to get this look then
just keep on watching I've missed you
guys so much it was really nice to take
a break but I'm so happy to be back and
I can't wait to get in this video here
we go okay this is my favorite primer at
the moment it is the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face base I've wanted this
product for so long and then I
collaborated with Bobbi Brown a little
bit ago and this has been my favorite
product sense but I'm just applying it
with my fingers you can use that as a
moisturizer to which I love priming
moisturizers this is was the best one
because I have super dry skin and this
makes my foundation looks so dewy and
fresh
whatever primer I have left on my
fingers I use it to put my flyaways down
okay chapstick after primer I'm taking
my Bobbi Brown extra bear glow
illuminating moisture balm I am obsessed
with this so I just do a little pump on
my finger oh wait that was a lot crap I
didn't need to use that much I just rub
a little bit on the high points of my
cheeks it's just like a natural
illuminating moisturizer this is
normally what I just wear to class I'll
wear that primer and then this just on
top but it looks really good under
foundation too I love really natural and
dewy makeup look so that's what we're
going for and then right now I'm just
obsessed with Bobbi Brown so I'm using
the Bobbi Brown Skin long-wear
weightless foundation cuz it's still one
of my favorites
and I'm gonna be using my Beauty Blender
to blend this in today sorry I haven't
been uploading a lot school has
literally taken over my life this school
is a lot harder than when I went to U of
A or SMC and I have a lot of homework
and I liked hanging out a friend
but it felt really good to just take a
break from YouTube for about a month but
I'm back and I'm gonna be uploading once
a week for you guys and I can't wait if
you guys are wondering which shade I use
I use the shade sand too and it matches
my skin tone perfectly I just got back
from the Bahamas and I wore sunscreen
the whole time I mean I got a little bit
sunburned on my back but I didn't really
get to set my eyelids I always just used
this Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish skin perfecting powder it's such
a long sentence and I'm just using this
morphe m58 one brush this is the only
part of my face that I do set just
because I'm going for that Duty skin
lock and this foundation does a really
good job of setting itself I'm sorry if
you guys can hear the construction it's
pretty loud but for contour i'm using
the fendi Beauty amber matchstick I love
this I just put it in those places I
don't get any of my forehead because it
always looks weird when I try and blend
it into my hairline I just can't get
that down
and then I used aggression we blend it
in what I love about this brush it's the
Penta beauty brush it doesn't take off
the foundation as I'm blending it in so
that's why I love this long okay and
then to give my face a little bit of
warmth I have the hoola kwikki contour
stick I used to use this all the time
but I ran out of it and then benefit
sent me this and I have it now I have a
fresh one
whoops so we're gonna add a little bit
of warmth to the face
laughs that's so pretty okay for my
eyebrows I'm just using the Too Faced
chocolate brownie brow pencil
and then I'm taking my 3d brow tones
from benefit I love this it kind of just
highlights four eyeshadow I'm using my
favorite eyeshadow color at the moment
it is the NARS narcissist wanted palette
this is honestly one of the best
eyeshadow palettes I've ever used look
at how beautiful these colors are okay
the first shade I'm just gonna use in
the palette is just this plain white one
I'm using my morphe e 2 7 brush this is
my favorite eyeshadow brush ever I'm
then gonna go in with these two right
here this really pretty light pink
shimmery one and then this nude matte
color we're going for a really light
eyeshadow look just because I want to
keep this super natural and dewy after I
blend those in I'm going to be taking
this really gorgeous shimmery shade on a
sigma e30 brush and I kind of just pack
this into my crease and all over my lid
and on a sigma e30 brush i'm just going
to sweep this underneath my lower lash
line if you have any glitter fallout i
just take a big fluffy brush fallout
doesn't really bother me that much and
then for my inner corner highlight I'm
taking this shimmery shade up at the top
right here it's so beautiful and then I
kind of bring it in to my inner corner
to my crease I just received this from
NARS and I'm really excited to use it so
I'm just gonna be taking the NARS wanted
cheek palette and I think I'm gonna put
this color and this color together on
just a blush brush this is the brush I'm
using it is a Sigma f40 oh wow that is
pigmented I could have shaken more off
definitely more warm than I thought it's
really beautiful though
okay and then to bronze the look up I'm
taking the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
medium deep bronzer this stuff smells so
good I want to eat it okay this is my
favorite bronzer brush I've ever used to
me my entire life it is the morphe M 5
to 7 now since I'm pretty pale this is
really dark for me so I have to go kind
of easy but it'll definitely bronze the
look up I can't even add any more on
that side because it's so bronzy
and then for highlighter I'm using the
new NARS Capri highlighter look at how
gorgeous this is oh my gosh and then
this is just a Sephora pro fan 65 brush
this highlighter matches my skin tone
perfectly and then I also add this in
with my eye shadow I kind of just sweep
over at all from the NARS man-ray
collection I'm going to be using this
lippy so beautiful it's in the shade
zambese I'm pretty sure that's how you
say it
and then I take a tissue and wipe half
of it all you finished the makeup look
I'm just taking this to face setting
spray I absolutely love this and I just
spray that kind of everywhere and that
is it for makeup I hope you guys loved
this look I just think it's so springy
and dewy okay now that we finished our
makeup I'm gonna show you guys my outfit
