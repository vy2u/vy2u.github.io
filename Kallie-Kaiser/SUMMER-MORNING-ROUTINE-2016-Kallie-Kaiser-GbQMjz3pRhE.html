okay when I actually filmed this shot I
didn't think it was so close I'm sorry
in advance but hey guys it's Cal and
welcome to my morning routine I am so
excited to do a voiceover for you guys
today just if you are wondering I do not
look like this when I'm sleeping this is
fake this is definitely more of what I
look like I am NOT a cute sleeper my
hair is always all over the place if I
go to bed with straight hair
I wake up with wavy hair it's the
weirdest thing ever also if I don't wake
up right away I usually sleep in until
around 9:00 nothing past 11:00 and so
will come and wake me up because she
wants me to come play frisbee with her
she's the cutest thing ever she's only
nine months and almost weighs 60 pounds
she used to only weighed 5 pounds it's
so crazy how fast she grew I couldn't
get a shot of this but she normally when
she wakes me up in the morning she comes
and sits right on my face and it is the
funniest thing on the planet I'm gonna
miss her so much
she is my everything I love her I also
have another dog Brody he's 13 he's
getting old I love him so much though
alright but once I finally decided to
get out of bed or Stella has woken me up
I reach for my water bottle or any water
that I have in my side table if you want
you can add some lemon to it make it
even more healthy it's just good to
drink water when you wake up in the
morning personally and if you guys are
wondering yes I do I do have pants on
but I'm just walking right to the
bathroom to brush my teeth
and then after this super up close shot
of me brush my teeth I decided to hop in
the shower it's just one of those
morning's where you need to be clean I
usually shower every other day because I
have fine hair so I don't want to shower
every day it would definitely dry out my
hair and my skin but for my face
cleanser use this milk makeup charcoal
cleanser it's amazing I really like this
stuff especially if you're not looking
for exfoliator for body wash and just
using this coconut body wash I've been
really loving it lately my shampoo the
shampoo smells so good it is original
mineral I've been using this brand for a
while now my mom introduced me to it so
good O&amp;amp;M I'm just lathering it up and
then for the conditioner I'm using the
same brand this stuff smells so good too
and I focus that towards the end of my
hair just because it tends to die off
faster but after my shower is complete I
dry off and I used my favorite lotion on
the planet Earth this smells so good is
cocoa cocoa powder cocoa butter what am
I saying
here's the toner I use for my face and
then my to a hydrating day and night
cream I really like this
it's just moisturize my face anything
that moisturize my face that doesn't
break me out works great for my skin I
have combination skin so it's dry and
oily but not really oily
alright I'm going back with the same
brand om I'm obsessed I don't like
anything that smells so this is the
perfect no.not detangler and then I just
brush the ends of my hair and work away
up once it's all brushed out I usually
like to add an oil to it so I'm using
this oil that smells so good folks that
on the ends and then work it up to the
scalp I actually won't dry my hair
upside down to get maximum volume since
my hair is so thin and it actually works
no lies no lies it actually really works
and then I just comb that out and then a
lot of you guys asked for a haircare
routine there is that is what my hair
looks like right after the shower with
all those products in it and it's
actually so soft I walk into my room
next to find something to wear as I get
ready for the morning making myself
breakfast putting my makeup on this is
not what I'm going to be walking out of
that
in I'm making a mess right now looking
for a shirt to wear
and then I just walk over because my bed
needs to be made in the morning lately I
haven't been making my bed but I usually
make it every single day I don't know
what's wrong with me
I am then going to grab my phone lay on
my bag some technology time intial ow
relax check Instagram if you guys aren't
following me on love you would follow me
my user name is Kelly Heiser
I love Instagram I think it's so fun
here I'm just like liking everyone's
pictures or I hope I am I usually do and
then I just go on my computer reply to
emails that I need to I love looking at
what you guys comment you all guys are
amazing I respond to them here's some
artsy shots of me typing then moving on
to breakfast oh my gosh guys I'm so
excited to share these little recipes
with you so we are going to be making an
egg dish and a acai bowl for the acai
bowl I usually just take this superfood
super fruit pack from Whole Foods or you
bet you could get these at Costco you
can mix them with water or additional
fruits if you want I had to add mangos
mango lemonade some coconut water I
think I added some cantaloupe in there
with ice as well yeah and then I just
blend that in a Mayan Vitamix once it
starts to get a nice cream texture
that's when you know it's ready
all right I just pour that in the bowl
and then I have additionally cut up
fruit on the side right here so I'm just
grabbing some strawberries bananas
cantaloupe and putting them on top in a
pretty layout I like to a granola as
well I don't know it just tastes really
good with the crunchiness and the
smoothie texture I also go in with some
chia seeds just because when they clump
up with the honey that you put on top
which I will in a second tastes so good
if anyone knows I'm talking about please
comment and tell me you know and I just
like to add some honey on top then you
have a perfect morning breakfast to
enjoy for yourself and it probably took
me under five minutes to make honestly
since we need protein every day I decide
to make an egg on top of some greens I
like to add some arugula as well all
these ingredients are from Whole Foods I
use my mom's olive oil I think it's the
brand I don't have announcer you guys
can see it in the bar in the b-roll
sorry I like to squeeze some lemon on
there as well tastes so good I love
cheese you can never have too much
cheese guys unless you're lactose
intolerant that sucks I'm sorry for you
I bet you have additional stuff that you
love but I love cheese so I'm adding
mozzarella and goat cheese on there I
will be adding avocado later on but you
can never have too much so I'm adding
wakka moly as well it tastes so good
mixed in to cook my egg I'm just using
this flat skillet looking pan if you
would say I buttered it down because
it's nonstick it's not nonstick so I
buttered it down to the egg will cook
properly on there I also add some water
in a dish and then put a cap over it so
it seems the top and cooks it sunny side
up properly it tastes so good just
enough that the yolk can pop and have it
go all over your greens and cheese I
also add some pepper on there it tastes
so good and then here is where I add my
avocado I added about a half of a
nautical avocado I think I cannot talk
and then this is so this looks weird I
know but I like to cut it up move it
around make it kind of a skillet looking
thing or a scramble it tastes so good
guys you're going to want to lick the
plate at the end I promise but after I
finish my breakfast and get some food in
me I go back up to my room open my
wardrobe and this is where I keep all of
my makeup to get ready for the day I am
going to be needing additional storage
soon but this is my makeup collection
for those of you who have asked to see
this before any products you guys are
wondering where I'm using in this
section I will link it down below but
I'm just patting in my foundation with
my Beauty Blender covering my under eyes
I believe this is the Dream Lumi
highlighting concealer by L'Oreal I
could be wrong I think it is L'Oreal and
I am just going to set that with a glam
natural
under eye setting powder this palette is
my new favorite thing it is a Z palette
from makeup geek I'm using the shade
Peach Smoothie I've hit pan on it I want
to cry it is my favorite transition
shade ever I think it shows up so well
at me because I'm very pale I don't know
if that could be it but I really like
this brush and then just using a sigma
brush as well
I'm using the sleek cosmetics solstice
palette for my highlighter today and I'm
using the Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer
this is the they're real mascara by
benefit I love this stuff it's really
great and then for my lips I'm using the
Jeffrey star I'm nude liquid lipstick I
actually like to dab it with a napkin
because the color won't be as intense
and this goes with the makeup look
perfectly and that is the finished look
now I am going to get dressed for the
day so I'm just putting on this super
cozy spandex tank top run three people I
love jewelry guys lately I've been more
and more obsessed with this brand called
Lily clasp you probably see them all
over my Instagram I'm obsessed so I
recently just bought myself this really
cute choker and then I layered it with
their other chokers underneath I love
when you wear silver with gold lately I
think looks really cool for my jean
shorts they're Levi's I thrifted these
and my belt is from Urban Outfitters I
will link all of these clothes down
below description box except for the
thrift in shorts I'm sorry
here is my backpack is from the brand
like dreams I got on Nasty Gal and I
just tied a handkerchief to it I look so
cute
here are my shoes Wow do I look pale in
this shot but my shoes are Jeffrey
Campbell they were just these sick red
booties I'm so into them a lot of you
guys asked how I would style them so
honestly this is a super casual look
that I'm going for and I am walking
towards the door I look awkward in this
walking clip I don't know what it is but
that is all I'm gonna go start my day by
thank you guys so much for taking the
time to watch this video I really have a
lot of fun making it I wanted to film it
in a different perspective
then I normally would have filmed
something so I really hope you guys
enjoyed that I had so much fun making
this I love you guys thank you so much
