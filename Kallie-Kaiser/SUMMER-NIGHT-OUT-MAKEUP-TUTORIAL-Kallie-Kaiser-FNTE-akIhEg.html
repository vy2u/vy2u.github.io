never said that before I don't know what
that was I am so excited because
supports today's video and when we're
doing this makeup tutorial and I'm so
pleased with how it turned out so I hope
you guys are just excited as I am if you
have never been my channel for hello
welcome my name is Callie and thank you
for clicking on this video if you want
to subscribe to my youtube channel you
can down below I love it and if you want
to follow me on my Instagram is at Holly
Kaiser but without further ado I'm super
excited to show you guys it makes the
look that I created this lip is so
beautiful and I use the new take me on
vacation kind of Cosmetics palette oh
it's so amazing okay here we go okay it
start this makeup look today we are
going to be using the it cosmetics
confidence in a cream moisturizer this
stuff is absolutely amazing it is for
all skin type I just picked up the large
two others so that's what's kind of
unused but oh my our fish stock has
literally changed my skin okay once our
skin is moisturized and you just let
that chill for a second we're going in
with our primer so I'm going to be using
the Too Faced hangover primer I have
never used this before but I do you see
it all over okay and then I'm just going
to go in oh this smells weird whoa it's
literally coconuts it smells just like
coconuts it's cool okay okay I love the
feeling of this okay and for foundation
today we were going for a more of a full
coverage look so these are the Kat Von D
lock of foundations I mix the shade
light for to neutral and light for for
cool literally these together create the
perfect shade for my face I'm so gross I
just take like the end of an
rushon I just mix them and then once I
have it stirred on the back of my hand I
like to test it out yeah that looks that
good I'm just putting on my face like so
I do clean this brush off after each use
so don't you guys worry about that and
then I go in with my Beauty Blender just
so you guys know I know I look sheriff
I'm like obviously this she is really
pale but it really matches my body I
swear so once we blend that all into our
skin we're going to be going in for eyes
first so I'm going to bring you in
closer I do use my foundation as an eye
primer for those of you that are curious
so you're going to see any white shade
any translucent powder that you want
just to set that foundation on your eyes
to prep your eyebrow shadow super
self-explanatory
the main eyeshadow help that we're using
today is be knew what Kylie cosmetics
take me on vacation palette wow I'm
honestly so upset so here is how
beautiful the colors look they're
absolutely just stunning so I'm actually
going to be using the brush that comes
in the palette we're just putting
surfboard in the crease we're really
just kind of messily blending it all
around because we kind of just want to
do a warm smoky eye tonight
and then I'm going to take a little bit
of paradise on the same blending brush
and we're kind of just going to deepen
the crease with that but we're taking it
probably the darkest shade in the
palette called first class we're just
going to dip it with that it's all on
top of the upper lash line
okay and then once you guys do that you
can kind of see like how everything just
really needs to be blended so you're
going to go back with your blending
brush and just blend everything together
now that we've blended it out quite a
bit now we're going to go in fixies
brows up a little bit it cosmetics brow
power and I just fill in wherever
there's little baby hairs that need to
be filled in so if you watch my makeup
tutorials before you know it's real when
we're going to do the brows oh my gosh I
looks so pretty in that once we blend
that out you're going to take the
benefit gimme brow like this okay I like
tennis like put the brows up I think
they look so cute when they're just
having a party or flight they're a
little outgrown I think that's so cute
now we are going to do our under-eye
concealers so to do that I'm taking my
tart shape I'm so excited I now own this
and probably all of you tuber that
doesn't element I'm in the shade fair
neutral this stuff is beautiful like wow
so we're just going directly in and I
like to bring this up to the eye and
we're going to create a cat eye so
that's kind of why I over blend the
eyeshadow because it's totally fine if
you do before we blend that I'm taking
my morphe prep and set spray since it's
been a minute since we've blended with
our foundation okay and then once we
spray that I'm going to add the toshe
how I pronounce this it's the YSL
concealer toshe you like wait
darn it I'm horrible oppressing stuff
this is more like not a full coverage
concealer so it looks pretty good just
highlight
high points in your face and then I just
go in with my Beauty Blender and we
blend that all out it blends out really
beautifully especially with this
foundation I think it works really well
together and you'll see that cat eye is
now created then I like to go in with my
hoola kwikki contour stick I know I need
this on my channel before but this just
gives such just like quick little warm
warm to our skin and I like to blend
that out with this so for a cake and
bake so you guys can see the product
coming off on there
I just want to out this gives our skin
literally the best ones and it's so easy
to blend out so like beginners have no
problem using this in their makeup
routine once we blend it out look at how
beautiful this contour is and the warmth
on our cheekbones up so in love so now
I'm going in with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder I normally don't bake
not really going to bake like crazy but
I'm definitely gonna be puttin some on
here a little a bit of contour
well that is bacon a little bit I'm
going to be going back in with the
palette and putting on shadow underneath
our eye so I'm taking the shades
therefore that we first use I'm going to
kind of drag it up with to connect to
the cat eye or ear be eyes and on top
well and then I'm taking one of my
favorite single payments pigments
pigments ever its own color pockets to
take it slow eye shadow and we're just
going to be putting this on our finger
to apply is a really pretty inner corner
highlight little moment and then I'm
taking this coffee color from the brand
I now pronounce that any brown eyeliner
you have works this looks like this
watch it's just like super creamy and
dark so we're just putting this on our
waterline
now we're going to add some bronzer on
top and taking any more fees and five to
seven brush was just the hoola light for
benefit and I'm just dipping in and this
is our bronzer
swarming off the entire look so I'm just
going to be taking the Natasha's anona
sculpting powder and this is the
lightest shade oh one light and I'm just
going to be taking this on an eyeshadow
brush this color is so pretty and then
just wipe away all of the powder that we
have on our face so for a highlighter
today since I kind of wanted to keep it
a really bronzy and beautiful nighttime
look I'm going to use the Shu a
skinny-dip highlighter this stuff is so
beautiful it looks like this and then up
the nose I do like to add a little brow
bone I think it looks really shitty and
since you kind of have to be bronzed to
wear it I just go back and take my
bronzer kind of spun them together
because as you guys can see since I'm so
pale you can literally see the highlight
restricts right here if you know what
I'm talking about then of course I like
to go in with a blush and since this is
my blush brush I already have blush on
here from last time
and I'm just going to use what summer on
it I don't know what shade it is but
there's still some pigment now for lips
I didn't want to do anything super bold
and crazy but then I'm so obsessed with
this satin lip it's in the shade bare
necessities I think it's the Alexis Wren
times co-op off collection yeah it is so
this color so great so I'm just going to
double it all my fingers and spread the
restaurant which I think you'd oh yeah
it's so creamy and beautiful I also just
like to take a lip pencil and kind of
help now to finish off the look I'm just
going to be taking my morphe prepping
thread I love that setting spray so much
and that is the completed makeup look I
