showing you guys my summer night routine
oh my gosh how cute is Stella
so usually right when I get home Stella
is outside and she's obsessed with
frisbee so I definitely take some time I
play frisbee with her she's so athletic
it's crazy
hey good morning chicken
I then head up to my bedroom to change
into something a little bit more
comfortable and if you guys wanted to
know my outfit of the day for what I'm
wearing right now my t-shirt is from
redone so are my shorts and then I'm
just wearing plain white high-top
converse my favorite thing about these
shorts though is that the zippers on the
side are legit you can actually unzip
them zip them I love it okay here's my
wardrobe in my room I try not to over
pack and bring a ton of stuff home for
summer but here's where I keep my makeup
do my makeup and I'm obsessed with this
jumpsuit I have been living in it lately
I'll link it down below for you guys
it's from the brand local heroes I love
it
since I loved my makeup for today I
wanted to take a few content photos so a
lot of times when I get home depending
on if I'm wearing makeup that day I'll
usually take advantage of that I got
ready and I'll shoot some content just
against my white wall on self-timer
which I have a video to show you guys
how I do if you want to check it out
once I am done shooting content photos
for Instagram I love to take my makeup
off right when I get home
so I'm just putting my hair up in a pony
but I am so excited because Clinique is
sponsoring this video so thank you so
much to Clinique for sponsoring this
video I'm just taking my Clinique take
the day off cleansing balm and it's
awesome because it just melts from this
really smooth balm into a luxurious oil
it cleans my face so thoroughly even
better than most of my cleansers that I
have and any heart to get sunscreen you
have on your face foundation eye makeup
it will just kind of melt away you don't
have to rub at your face really hard
which I love and the formula is
exceptional at removing any properties
that you need what's amazing is in July
you guys can take home deluxe samples of
take the day off
makeup remover balm with any purchase of
a Clinique cleanser or makeup remover so
make sure to just check out my
description box below
after I remove all my makeup and Pat my
face dry I'm going to be using the
confidence in a cream buy cosmetics for
my moisturizer after I kind of take all
eye makeup off and I just want to relax
I'll sit my chair kind of go through my
emails respond to you guys comments do
anything that I really need to get done
on my laptop I even sometimes lately
I've been watching shits Creek it's so
funny and then I also been watching well
I just started the second season of
Westworld so I can't tell you too much
about it because I'm only on the second
episode but if you guys have any movie
recommendations just comment them down
below because I need something else to
watch or another TV show recommendation
is amazing too
for dinner sometimes my mom makes dinner
and we all sit at the family table but
tonight I happen to be home alone so I
just decided to heat up some leftover
meatball spaghetti yum yum
I normally would never give attention to
the microwave because I don't believe in
it but I used it I heated up my pops on
my microphone and then I love cutting
out my pasta with a fork and knife it's
so much easier to eat but angel here's
my favorite if you're wondering and then
I just decided to take some Parmesan
cheese and greet that right on top I
love that sound
I swear she likes to harass the
neighbors so y-you have to leave me come
here I just love you since tonight is
kind of just a chill vibe I play
fortnight I love fortnight it's all the
way back for quite a bit depending on if
I'm honest playing with squads or just
playing battle royale by myself so I put
in a few clips of me playing say she go
when I start getting ready for bed I
just grab a t-shirt from my wardrobe
this one's actually from Etsy I got it
quite a while ago but I love it they
always have really cool stuff on Etsy
for the first step of my skincare
routine before I go to bed I take the
old Henriksen transforming night gel and
I kind of just Pat that into my skin all
over my face and then the second product
I use is the origins relief and
resilience mushroom serum I love this it
takes away redness - which is great and
then I also use my it cosmetics by my
under-eye this stuff is so moisturizing
it saves me so when I wake up in the
morning I feel like a brand new baby I
also love putting lavender just on my
wrist my neck and the temples sometimes
under my nose - it's just so relaxing I
love it I do take off most of my rings
when I fall asleep just the big ones
that I wear on my fingers and then I
also take off my watch and if you guys
are wondering where I get most any rings
they're just from Poshmark oh okay so
here's me just crawling to bed I usually
will go on my phone until I fall asleep
or I fall asleep watching a TV show or
something like that but I hope you guys
love this video thank you so much for
taking the time to watch it and I love
you guys bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
