we're going to be filming a summer
wedding today I'm really excited for
this video because I love food so much
I'm such a foodie you guys probably
already know that also if you guys want
to follow me on my Instagram is just at
Cali hi sir
and you could subscribe to my youtube
down below by just clicking the button
but I would love to eat in this video so
I would like to let you know that this
video is in collaboration with the app
like some you may have heard me talk
about Lifeson before I love like them I
have been using it since May now and
basically lisen allows you to track your
nutrient intake for the day for the week
for the month my goal in life some since
I personally don't calorie track I just
want to be healthier consume healthier
foods and just have a fresher lifestyle
overall have a link down below in the
description box that you guys can
download if you like some app for free
and kind of follow me along once you
download the app you could take the life
score test basically they should ask you
a bunch of various questions about kind
of food you intake the number of through
your eating a day kind of questions like
that and you literally get caylor's
feedback from the experts at lightsome
which i think is really cool and that
helps you kind of have a healthier
lifestyle i love to show you guys a
little bit more about life them but i
want to show you guys what i made for
breakfast today so without further ado i
can't wait to get in this video and here
we go for breakfast I usually make this
smoothie almost every single day I'll
have the recipe in the description box
if it's hard for you guys to follow
along so I just take 1/2 a cup of water
and then I take a half a cup of frozen
raspberries you could also totally use
fresh raspberries it doesn't matter and
then I use 1/4 cup of this Wallaby
organic Greek yogurt I love this stuff I
also for sweetness you can also choose
to add honey I add two dates and then
1/4 of a banana and then I obviously
take the skin off for our nests today I
use 2 tablespoons total of walnuts and
then 1 tablespoon of almonds I couldn't
find blanched almonds and then we're
using this pure honey I literally just
do a drop of it and then I add about 1/2
of a cup to a full cup of ice blend that
all together the blender I'm using is a
Vitamix
once you are done blending this is what
this smoothie consistency looks like
this is probably when I favorite
smoothies ever it does have protein in
it because we added the almonds you can
totally add more nuts if you need to to
so but I got the recipe from the whole
foods Vitamix cookbook and it's called
nutty fruit smoothie
moving on in between breakfast and lunch
I try and drink as much water as I
possibly can I also drink lemon water
right when I wake up in the morning
before I go to bed and definitely in
between meals just throughout the day I
actually carry a water bottle around my
house with me and when I'm driving in
the car and stuff so as you guys can see
I'm just preparing myself some lemon
water what's really nice is the life
some apps actually have a water tracker
I used to be such a camel I struggled
with dehydration and because of this
water tracker it makes me just want to
drink more water so anytime you have a
glass throughout the day you could just
add on your life some app that you've
drank in more water they also have a
fruit and vegetable tracker as well
which i think is so neat and it's really
good for people that struggle with not
getting as much nutrient intake
throughout the day so moving on to lunch
I am obsessed with sandwiches lately the
bread I'm using today is this delicious
gluten-free it's plant-based and egg
free I just popped you in the toaster
because I do refrigerate my bread and if
anyone is from San Diego this is the
board and brew sauce oh you're so good
so then I just add some baby arugula on
top of the sauce I decide to put with my
sandwich then we're going to add some
pepper jack cheese I love this cheese
just a slice is perfect and then I
decided to add some turkey for some
protein
avocado is an addiction and it's the
best addiction ever I love it oh my gosh
but I'm just cutting up avocado here and
I'm just going to be placing that on my
sandwich I also like to cut up some
Tomatoes it just makes the sandwich
taste a little bit more fresh I usually
add some dill pickles on here as well
but I didn't have any in our fridge
today so the sandwich will have to do
without it I add a little bit more board
and brew sauce and then I put the
sandwich together and it is so yummy
this literally took me five minutes it
is so simple so easy and it totally
fills me up after I take a bite of my
sandwich it was so good moving on I just
wanted to show you guys another awesome
tool that is on the life somehow my
favorite thing about this is the recipes
page there are thousands and thousands
of recipes on here I was never a
Pinterest girl so I am really happy I
now have this I have actually used this
and made food from this I have a bunch
of recipes saved and hearted so if I
click on a recipe for example it tells
me the exact fat carbs protein calories
and exactly how I need to make it to
most of the stuff is going to be under
20 minutes I've even seen recipes on
here that literally take five or ten
minutes and then what's really cool is
you can literally search anything you
can search vegan vegetarian gluten-free
as you guys can see I scroll across
these hashtags at the top let's click on
lunch and it's just going to open up a
bunch of recipes for example this salmon
burger with mango salsa looks absolutely
amazing Wow moving on to dinner I am
going to be having this doctor pre a
Gers I probably pronounced that wrong
there these kale puffs they are so good
they're almost like little baby kale
tater tots
so I preheated the oven to 450 and I
cooked them for 15 minutes or until
golden brown and then while those are
cooking in the oven I'm going to be
taking some burrata this stuff I think I
got it whole food no no this one is from
Costco actually and I'm taking a clean
tomato cutting that up however you would
like to cut up your tomato
once you add that tomato on the plate I
then will take the broad out and I like
to cut out my burrata because I want to
disperse it across the tomatoes before I
add some olive oil then we add some
olive oil pepper I love black pepper it
tastes so good on everything and then I
also add a little bit of salt not a lot
and then once those Kel puffs are done
you just pop them on the plate and this
was so good so fresh it's perfect for
just a light summer dinner it did really
honestly fill me up the entire time but
I still get a little hungry so about an
hour and a half later my mom heated up
some tortilla soup around like 10:00
p.m. so I decided to have some tortilla
soup
and it was so good moving on to dessert
oh my gosh I love dessert so much I had
to share these gluten-free chocolate
chip cookies from the tape's Bake Shop I
eat a whole box by my entire self
they're so good and you don't feel bad
at all because it's almost like cookie
chips that's exactly what they taste
like they are so delicious and then I'll
either go to Andy's custard ice cream I
live in Illinois I think it's only in
Illinois but otherwise this stuff is so
good it's 20 my favorite one is the I
think it's the peanut butter pretzel
this is just their sea salt caramel and
I don't even put it in a bowl I doubt of
the tub don't tell my mom she would be
pissed thank you guys so much for taking
time to watch this video it means so
much to me if you guys want to download
the app like them for free just click
the link in my description box and there
you have it I hope you loved it bye guys
love you have a good day
