be a tutorial on my eye makeup right
here it's like a smokey cat eye and I'm
super excited to share it with you the
technique that I've used is tape and I
got some new eyeshadow brushes which I'm
really excited about but I used tape
here and it gave it this like sexy cat
eye look and I'm super excited to share
with you guys also my friend Michaela
here on YouTube her channel name is
beauty lush she's amazing I want you to
check out her video that she did for her
makeup on New Year's Eve she also did a
winged eyeliner and it looks awesome so
I will link her video down in the
description box below please check it
out and out further ado I would love to
get into my videos so here we go alright
guys we're taking this my cat Beauty
cosmetics eye primer and we're just
going to be applying this all over the
lid covering our veins with our finger
just really using this as a base to keep
our eye shadow on all day long and then
what's ever left over on your finger
just slide it underneath the eye and
we'll be putting our shaver there as
well now take a piece of tape like you
are continuing your lower lash line and
now we are taking this box on pot in the
shade Mutt and we're going to be putting
this on a paddle brush and applying this
all over the lid
you guys can pack this on as much as you
want I know I wanted mine to be relief
dark so I put more than a few coats
now we are using the naked 1 palette and
the color we are going to be using is
naked this is going to be our transition
shade and we're just applying this with
a really big fluffy brush all over our
eye on that same fluffy brush we are
taking this shade dark horse and we're
just going to give our eye more
definition with this color really darken
up the transition shade that we just put
on
now we are going to be taking the shade
hustle on a small crease brush and we
are going to be moving this in a
triangle motion towards the outer
corners of our eyes and moving this
across the crease and towards the inner
corner you guys can make this as dark as
you would like make it even smokier than
I did go right ahead
I'm going to be taking my mac fix+
and spraying it on the same paddle brush
we used earlier with this shade silk
teddy from the Too Faced natural eye
palette and we are going to be putting
this all over our lid it gives it a very
super shock metallic you look and I
thought it was perfect to finish off
this look
now from the Naked palette we are going
to be using the shade creep and we're
using the same small crease brush we
were using earlier here we are just
darkening up the shade hustle and giving
our eye more definition
now we're going back with our large
blending brush and we're just blending
all the colors together really making it
really smoky and stuff and then we're
ready to take the tape off then go back
in with your big fluffy brush and remove
any harsh lines
also grab some tissues with some makeup
remover on it or some makeup remover
pads and remove any excess shadows that
you don't want on your face here I'm
just blending out any harsh lines that I
don't want on my eyes now we're taking
the shade hustle on a very small shadow
brush and we're just putting this
underneath our lower lash line to give
our eyes more definition and smoke out
the look
now we're taking that color we've put on
the top of our lid silk teddy and we're
going to put this under our eye as well
give our lower lash line some highlight
now you're taking the shape Bobby dazzle
from the vice 3 palette and we are going
to use this on another paddle brush to
highlight our brow bone and inner
corners
now I'm taking my Stila stay all day
waterproof liquid eyeliner in the shade
intense black and I'm just going to be
doing a cat eye with this look
now I'm taking my fortune room there's
one Lake ran in the shade Charmian I'm
going to be putting this on my waterline
then to finish up a look I'm taking my
Bobby Brown smoky eye mascara and just
putting this on the top and bottom
lashes
all right and we are done that is the
fully completed look
