thought it'd be really fun to film and
affordable clothing all for you guys
just because I'm in college I can't be
spending on her dollars on up here short
$200 on a shirt or like $90 on a
necklace you know even though we're all
guilty of that we want to treat
ourselves that's totally fine who told
you that if you can but yeah I just
thought these clothes that I'm about to
share with you our three alternatives
and they're just you could you don't
even have to spend that much money to
get amazing clothes as you guys will see
in this video when I share with you guys
these goodies that I have yes so here we
go I love body suits right now I think
they're amazing so this is actually my
first white body suit that I have it is
from is those cabinet and it's just
super crisscross amazing comfort
material the straps are adjustable and
it's like this on the bottom and then it
just snaps under your jeans this looks
so so good with high-waisted jeans
because the stomach is kind of cut out
and then it quits cross it across your
boobs I actually wore this shirt in my
last bikini video that I uploaded for
the best bikini spring on spring break
and I think it is the cutest beachy is
shirt ever it photographs an amazing and
it do you guys can see the camera just
holds it really well it's a very
lightweight and beautiful material I got
this in the size small and it is the
cotton candy brand from Isabelle's
cabinet the sleeves are super cute and I
just everything about this shirt is just
so darling I love it so much I got this
body suit that Criss crosses in the back
and it's kind of like a deep v-neck in
the front but it's definitely a tank top
it's just this rib black material and
forever21
Congrats it is cheeky or a thong
material so it's not annoying to wear
with jeans it just snaps in the back and
I love how effortlessly keep this look
with jeans and this is from forever 21
this is from nak D I haven't worn
because I still have the tags on
honestly I wish I found naked a while
ago thank you to them for these goodies
this is the most beautiful wrap I've
ever seen in my entire life
it's just gorgeous I'm going to in t go
within the week and I am so beyond
excited this is gonna look amazing on
the beach wearing a bikini under it you
can even have one leg keeping out where
it open where it clothes like a bathrobe
I honestly cannot wait to photograph in
this I think it is so beautiful and it's
just like this really sheer nice linen
material I also got two one-piece
bikinis from naked this one I put I put
both of these in my bikini collection
video that I recently just uploaded this
one laces up and it's a size small it's
a halter design and it's honestly so
flattering on the body and then this one
is all black as well and it just has a
kind of a deep V and this one is a
little bit more cheeky and I like that
because it does higher up on the legs
which makes me look taller this is
probably my favorite thing I got it is a
two-piece the skirt is long I got this
in an extra small and the leg opens up
right here is the hottest thing ever I
cannot wait to wear this in Antigua and
then the top is like this it's just like
keep black tank top crop top and it has
that V design that criss cross over each
other this is very flattering on my body
I love it so much and then this design
is really cute where it ties in the
front if you guys could see that on the
skirt and then this is just elastic but
this will photograph amazing and you can
either make it super casual or super
fancy this dress is gorgeous
my sister's obsession fit she wants to
wear before I do and I'm like but it
just has a bunch of holes in it and it
has this design I'm not like that halter
top design and then it kind of goes to
the knees and it has this amazing mesh
pattern with these vertical stripes
going down obviously the middle is
covered in
so nothing is going to be see-through or
anything like that IATA size extra small
in this and it does fit great I kind of
wish I went to size smaller because
around the boob area and the butt area
is where I left so um it just doesn't
fit me as good on there but I think this
is so beautiful for a night out or some
really fancy event that you need to go
to they honestly have very nice dresses
and this is very very nice quality and
then I have some bra let's to share with
you guys I got a size small in both of
these bro let's
they are just super nice to wear
underneath a tank top or something if
you want to be really vision free during
that day I love the design on the back
of this one and this one's kind of
leather bustier design I got these both
in a size small but I didn't already say
that and then the back is left like that
but I love bra lots and Urban Outfitters
ball hats are very pricey so I feel like
these are a little bit more cheap than
that they're still made a great black
waste material and these don't look
cheap at all they even have like a mesh
design right here you guys can see that
triangle but I love these bra let's so
much and I think they're gonna look
great layered underneath tank tops or
even for like a Coachella festival
outfit I think just look amazing the
next thing I got is just this perfect
simple black tank top dress it's super
lightweight and caught in it goes down
to the perfect length of my body it's
not too short it's not too long I got
this in a size extra small and I cannot
just wait to wear this to class or
walking around this was so inexpensive
and it honestly feels like a really nice
cotton so since Coachella is coming up
everyone has been falling in love with
body chains and stuff I'm going to be
wearing this super cool 411 lemons
brought light to Coachella and I thought
this if I can put this on would look
amazing layered with it so it just hooks
in the back like this and it's going to
look so so cool with my brother I can't
wait to wear this to Coachella it is
from naked as well also if you guys want
a code for naked I have 20% off of all
naked clothing if you also make your
clothing if you want to use that it's
just Cali 20 yeah so I make it even more
affordable but yeah I just
cest with this I think it's so pretty
and it's going to look amazing just
layered with some denim shorts also have
my words on the beach and in T what with
a bikini because I think this would
photograph well
so I remember you guys this always been
hard for me to find really nice cool
inexpensive graphic tees that are just
like full of comfort and a really good
t-shirt size so honestly I'm obsessed
with this the brand is called NYC t
clothing I got all these graphic tees in
a size small and I will be making a cool
video what you could do with graphic
tees which I will be uploading soon but
here is this California one it's just
all black I love just wearing this with
jeans tying it up and indeed it shoes
that's why I love graphics so much this
one says babe and all white letters and
I feel like star so hard find
inexpensive ones because brandy
Melville's are like 30 to 35 dollars
sometimes and that's just ridiculous
so this one says 90s and it's all white
I just it's so simple and it would look
good with like a ponytail some cute
necklaces and chokers and sunglasses I
think that would look so cute and then I
don't even know how many times I
probably sent cute in this video and
then this one says cry baby and really
cool bubbly letters and it's just
outlined in black kind of like that 70's
look but this one will look really cool
tied as well and then I also got two
Nittis this one says la California and
it's super cozy I got this one in a size
extra small small because I wanted it to
fit normal with leggings and stuff I've
already worn this one about six times
and I haven't washed it yet I'm proud of
it it's fine um but this one is a medium
large and it's so cozy and it's in this
charcoal gray color and says California
I don't know I just I think this looks
so cute parent under a denim jacket or a
leather jacket with a hat or something
and that's what I wore it with yeah it's
just a really nice cotton material and I
love that company a lot this is an
adorable tank top that laces up is from
the brand and why TC I love this top
this is the coolest lavender gray color
and then the way crisscross is is super
flattering mrs. ribbed and I got this in
a size small thank you guys so much for
