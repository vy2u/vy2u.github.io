really want to share with you guys a
makeup tutorial I have been wearing this
makeup lately and then most the time
whenever I do my makeup for a photo
shoot
if you guys follow me on instagram you
know I collab with multiple
photographers every so often and not all
the time there's a makeup artist so I do
my makeup for most of those and this is
definitely the makeup I would do for it
also we are going to be using the
Smashbox full exposure palette I love
this house so much it has the best
shades over here we're probably gonna be
focusing over here and might might need
some of that but they have amazing
colors some bronzy sparkle really
putting on our lids and good oh excuse
me and then just really great neutral
colors
otherwise this mate was just really
great for spring I hope you guys enjoyed
this look so without further ado here we
go to start this makeup look I'm using
this coats face so soft blends
translucent sheer matte finish just
because it is sunscreen and as you can
see well right now I have a spray tan so
we're gonna be able to go pretty tan
with this look but I'm up a really pale
person so if sunscreen is a very
important part of my daily routine you
can kind of see how it like it's a
moosie texture feels so good and then
once you blend all that sunscreen and
I'm just gonna be using my Eco lifts
Mago kiss chapstick because I will be
putting lipstick on later in this look
we're gonna start with our eyes so I'm
gonna zoom you guys in okay I start with
our eyes I'm using this Smashbox 24-hour
photo finish i primer and we're just
gonna prime our eyes like normal
okay to start this look I'm just gonna
be taking the lightest shade and the
palette and mattifying my eye primer I'm
just using this evolution BX 80 this
brush is just good to pack stuff on your
eyes and a quick motion and then to go
in we are going to be building on these
two colors right here starting off
really really light with the brush and
then building those up in the crease in
a round formation taking my wet and wild
crease brush um this was $0.99 very
affordable brush and I'm just going to
be lightly packing on the lightest
neutral shade
and then I'm taking the brush of that
this maxbox palette came with and I'm
just gonna be maybe dabbing it in this
darker Brown and we're just gonna drag
this through the crease exactly where
you want the color to be and then I'm
just gonna blend that color out that we
just put in our corner with this tapered
blending brush from Lux and this is the
205 just gonna be really light strokes
just blend that color all over the
crease I know we already primed our eyes
but for this color to pick up on our lid
I want to use another primer to put as a
base for the glitter to pop so I'm using
my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
and this is a long-lasting eyeshadow
base so we're just going to be putting
this on this where is the brush small
eye concealer brush and this is by Wet n
Wild this brush was also $0.99 so it's
so affordable
we're gonna see how well it packs on
with this brush from boy je vous its
double-ended now we're gonna go in with
this dark brown color right here and I'm
taking this really really pacted brush
from watch a via that's double-ended and
I'm also going to put some Brown with
this royal and langnickel evolution
brush from BX 95 I'm just going to put
some in my crease because I want the
look to be a little bit darker
okay so I've never used this palette
without mac fix+ and I fell at my
sister's house if you guys ever wonder
where I film because this isn't my dorm
so I'm using her mac fix+ think all she
had it because the color of the glitter
without the mac fix+ wasn't coming out
the way I wanted it to so we're just
gonna whoop we're just gonna spray our
brush whoa that was a lot with Max Plus
ah everything is falling look at that
difference wipe away all the glitter um
let's just do our eyebrows now I'm going
to be using my benefit gimme brow this
is my favorites I haven't used anything
else for my eyebrows ever because this
is the best I don't fill my resin
because I love the natural look of
eyebrows in photos whoops and other
stuff like that so we are just going to
brush this through our eyebrows plus I
do not have a strong eyebrow shape which
is kind of depressing only makeup
artists can make my eyebrows look
amazing I just hadn't figured out the
trick yet to prime our face I'm going to
using Smashbox photo finish foundation
primer primitive atomic moisturizer for
foundation today we are going to be
using this hello flawless oil-free
oxygen Wow broad-spectrum SPF 25
brightening sunscreen makeup from
benefit I got this when I was a senior
in high school and it's super tan
because I got it when I had a spray tan
at prom and I'm a spray tan right now so
this is perfect it is in the shade honey
and I'm just gonna be squirting that on
my hand like so and this is perfect
because it matches my skin cone skin
come in matches my skin tone rebuttal I
can't talk I cannot talk putting this
all over our face with this brush it's
from Target I
the name of it or anything but it is
sold at Target and it's amazing I love
it but we're just gonna do big circles
and blend this in I really need to
invest in the beauty blender I think I'm
gonna get the $6 Real Techniques well
I'm just because I've heard it's so so
good and it's just as squishy as the
beauty blender and as a flat side which
people love next going in with my by my
under eye from it cosmetics this is in
the shade neutral medium I'm just taking
this brush I think this brush or I can
see the brushes from forever 21 I know I
don't know why but it is and we're just
gonna do kind of like stair steps stair
tips out stair tapped out stairs stairs
steps I can't say it just sweeping that
under the eye out and in and out and in
you never want to like sweep it across
your face you really want to just pack
it and dab that make sense now I'm gonna
go in with my translucent powder this is
this shade meal and this is the brain
your minerals brush from wet and wild
these are really great cuz they're only
$2.99 we're just gonna kind of pack the
translucent on all over our face in the
places where we get the oiliest for
bronzer i'm using this smashbox contour
kits super fun i feel like we could
brighten up our under eye with this
it's not a banana color but it is white
and highlighting so we're just gonna dab
that under the eyes I'm taking this
contour brush from Wet n Wild super
inexpensive brush I still can't talk and
we're going in with the contour shade
first really lightly though
any excess that you don't want to be on
your face and we're really just gonna
use this as a base of where we're gonna
put our bronze are on I don't know if
you guys can see that color coming
through but it's a really really pretty
in so then we're just gonna dust some
under here to give that effect and then
up here because I do think it looks
really pretty when you have color warm
up here and then if you want to put some
on your nose you can we're just taking
the warmer shade part of the two
bronzers and I'm using the brush the
palette came with because I like the
angle of it okay we're just dusting this
right on top of where we put that
contour and then as you guys can see I
look pretty pretty scary and then if you
want to dust whatever is left on the
brush above your temples under here
again I'm going to be taking this kabuki
brush and we're just gonna buff out the
bronzer so for highlighter we were going
to be using the Physicians Formula in
Miami strip people rave about this
drugstore highlighter all the time
this is my roommate's highlighter Thank
You Natalie I took it from your makeup
well this is a powder brush but we're
just gonna be taking the top two light
shades the lightly dust this not make it
like crazy extreme but we do want a
really really pretty glow I kind of
switched over to this small stipple
brush from wet and wild which I really
like I don't know it was more compact so
I could apply more product at once Wow
would you guys see that intense
highlight maybe I put too much fun and
then we're just gonna put film on the
tip of our nose like that I just think
it looks really cute and then Cupid's
bow
for blush I'm taking this really pretty
lavender pink color from Mac this is in
the shade Sakura I had this memorized
mineralized blush forever and it just
never seems to run out so we're just
gonna pax them on to the brush you can
see the color on there wipes them off
and we're just gonna sweep this okay I
just finished my blush you guys can see
I build it up the color and I think it
looks really really good with the
bronzer and I look okay to finish our
eyes I'm going to be dusting this color
and this color underneath and then I'm
gonna do mac fix+
on a paddle brush and go back in with
this and put this in my inner corner and
underneath my lower lashline corner my
brush I'm using is this miss Shady Lady
from moated I don't know this is one of
my favorite crease brush as ever
but I'm gonna use it to dust color under
my eyes because I like how it kind of
dust a lot of product underneath
I am taking this for chaemoo eyeliner in
this shade chocolate it's just this
really pretty brown and we're just
placing this on the lower lash line but
we're not going to go all the way to the
corner we're just putting it right here
now to move on to mascara I'm using
benefit roller lash this is one of my
all-time favorite mascaras I think it
makes my lashes the longest they can
possibly be so that we can say we're
done with our eyes I'm taking the
highlight shade and the full exposures
palette and we're just putting this on
our brow bone if you guys watched my
haul I recently post on my channel I was
