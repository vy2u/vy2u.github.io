I'm going to be filling a mini try and
haul for you guys normally my triumph
holes are so long I can never get the
video under 12 minutes I don't know
what's wrong with me but many of you
guys requested items that I was putting
my snapchat story to make a try and hope
for you my snapchat is on public it is
at Kellyanne and my instagrams at Kelly
heights or if you guys were interested
in my social medias I would love to get
into this video I also have another try
on haul that I'm going to be uploading
soon and that is going to be the stuff
that I bought when I was on holiday in
Germany in Spain most of that stuff is
from Zara and in store and then this
stuff in this mini try and haul right
now is mostly online clothing stores but
I can't wait to get in this video so
here we go
earlier today when I was getting ready
to film this video and I was doing my
makeup I received a package at my front
door and I just want to share what you
guys have beautiful this packaging is
even though I ordered two items from
Marc Jacobs Beauty it is such a waste of
packaging but you guys just have to see
how beautiful the packaging is and then
you gotta dig deep down here and then
you find what you got but I'll show you
guys what I got recently I've been
buying a love of new makeup recently so
I'll definitely doing a makeup haul soon
as well so I picked up a Marc Jacobs um
tantric bronzer and this is the mega
bronze I love this packaging I think
it's so pretty and I bought this because
mani anyway uses it in all of his and
makeup swirls and I love him I love
anything he uses I trust anything he
uses so I decided to try this out and
I'll let you guys know um what it's like
but I am wearing it today and I like the
warmth that it gives on my pale skin and
then I also got this lipstick I borrowed
my friend's lipstick from Coachella and
this is the one Shelby borrow so I had
to buy for myself
it is the moody Margo you nudes Marc
Jacobs um I believe it yeah it's their
sheer lip gel and it is the most beaut
nude color and the packaging is also
beautiful I am wearing on my lips now
the first place I shopped at is Nasty
Gal fill section and I got this really
really pretty pastel floral skirt from
for lovin lemons
it was super duper on sale which I was
so beyond excited about just because for
love and money is one of my favorite
brands this shirt I'm actually wearing
right now I bought two years ago and
it's for lovin lemons and I got this in
a size extra small it is up for 11
lemons times max you go it has a very
sheer detail near the ending of the
skirt and then I normally don't wear
anything yellow and this is yellow and
blue and it looks really nice on the
body they're still section is so good
right now just because I had an extra 40
percent off for July 4th of July weekend
and I got another pair of Jeffrey
candles they are just these black
booties I love them I will try and link
everything down below description box
that I have in this video it has elastic
cutouts or whatever you want to call
them going on right here with a simple
heel and a pointed toe I almost feel
these are kind of western looking the
suede with leather is very sturdy and
nice the only thing is if you have a
wide foot good luck trying to get it in
this hole I have to completely contort
my ankle and stretch them in there but
honestly I love these shoes and they're
worth every sill amount that I spent on
them at the net Werner Nasty Gal
is this bejeweled blue black and silver
choker I thought this was a great
statement piece with an all black or all
white outfit even a jumper or jumpsuit
would look amazing with this piece and
it was super cheap so I was excited that
it was on sale
lately I have been shopping like crazy
on dolls kill calm just because they
have so many bold and trendy and spunky
outfits I feel also I will be shopping
on there mostly for my love ELISA looks
I'm going all four days this year so if
any
they're going comment down below I'd
love to know and I'm thinking of making
a Lollapalooza suggested outfits or kind
of a lump UN's on festival lookbook I
let me know if you guys would like to
see that but what I got adults kill is
this white mesh Croft t-shirt I got some
size small and this looks so good with
bra let's tank tops anything layered
underneath this and high-waisted jeans
and then I picked up this really pretty
light pink patched work bomber jackets I
think this is so cool I love how thick
the top bandage as well as the bottom
band I got this in a size small that
zippers pockets I love bomber jackets I
think they're a huge hit this season and
you can win them throughout the winter
which is so cool and then from Urban
Outfitters I got this really nice
low-cut black bodysuit is 100 cent
caught into it's so soft and comfortable
this is a size small and from that brand
chemichi blue I believe I'm saying that
right or wrong I don't know it's super
low neck but you can also adjust the
straps that crisscross in the back if
you want it higher which would not be as
revealing or lower if you are into that
look anyone wear it broadly under it but
this looks amazing with any sort of
bottoms just because it is a bodysuit
got this amazing white beautiful crochet
lace whatever you want to call it dress
it is a pretty thick white material so
you're not going to see anything through
it it's made so nicely I wore this when
we went up to park well I could be
pronouncing that wrong we're in
Barcelona Spain and I wore this dress to
Park well and took pictures all around
the beautiful park that Gaudi made and
it was amazing I got so many compliments
and in Vita Mallen Instagram bio they
call themselves a modern bohemian
rhapsody' style on my gift boaty ha it
doesn't get much better than that and
they are
Uptown Phoenix and look at this soy
candle is cutest size ever this is the
best smelling candle I've ever smelled
in my life it is the scent lavender
coconut this isn't a real scent it's
also good I also have the cutest
jewellery from them this is a pineapple
necklace and earrings I am so obsessed
with these this look so then layering
with any type of necklace any look I
layer it with this look I had it on
earlier whoops it just blew me but I'm
absolutely in love with this I think is
so cute and delicate hi hmm I got this -
peach that I'll show you guys the top in
a second I got these bottoms in a size 2
they fit perfect I almost like that
they're a little baggy around my thigh
area they have amazing cutouts they are
a bit sheer but I have no problem
wearing an underwear word them nude
underwear with them you guys should know
that these are more neon in person than
they appear on camera or on on the side
I'll try and link it down below
hopefully they still have it online and
then I got a size 4 in the top the top
is just as pretty the sleeves are that
bell-bottom style I don't know if that's
the right thing to say but you guys will
correct me if I'm wrong um it's almost a
v-neck shape and it has that same
cutouts all over it they look so great
together and I can't wait to photograph
in this to talk about some basics with
you guys I just have these simple white
denim light wash shorts they're from one
teaspoon they're the size 22 I love one
teaspoon I probably include a pair of
these shorts and every single one of my
hauls um they're the Bandit styles and
these happen to be more ripped than my
other ones I own which I really like and
then I have this white top from
Isabelle's cabinet it is quite long so
you can tie it maybe cut it up if you
want it has holes in all
which I love I love anything cut up I've
made so many girls wear shirts like this
the back has a seam that makes it
embroider to a babydoll neck babydoll
side on the back I got this in a size
small and is from Isabelle's cabinet and
then I got this dress from Isabelle's
cabinet this is probably my new favorite
dress I've ever worn my entire life I
posted a picture on this and Instagram
on Instagram and you guys were loving it
I got this in a size small as well it's
super v-neck and then in the back its
lace-up which I love and then the bottom
is super flowy it's just a beautiful
beautiful gray blue color with white
accents my last video that I uploaded on
my channel it was a get ready with me
video and this was the outfit for that
video I had a link down below the shoe
box if you guys want to check it out but
this is the brand sister so the label
they make 100% pure silk dresses from
Australia and this is probably my new
favorite thing in my closet it also
comes with a matching choker that you
can design anyway or however it way you
want to wear it or tie it with this
dress I got this in the shade moister
and I think it's so beautiful I love the
way it hangs on the body I have two
chokers and a ring from Isabelle's
cabinet I wore this choker on instagram
with this dress and they are paired
together perfectly it's just this super
sweet suede thick grade band and it's
very comfortable I forgot it was even on
my neck when I wore it these are such a
trend right now I love how it almost
looks like a belt buckle actually have a
belt that looks exactly like this choker
I like how it's a thin suede band and
then the silver buckles are huge
statement piece
I definitely might be wearing this a
Lollapalooza I have been drooling over
small delicate jewelry lately so I
picked up a few new pieces to act my
jewellery collection I got this choker
that I've had my eyes on for the past
three months from Lilly clasp online I
don't
name of the choker I'll leave a link
down below description box and then I
also got stuff from the Carly baker
brand and I don't know if I'm
pronouncing all this name right but I'll
show you guys what I picked up so I got
these beautiful star earrings they
dangle I think these are amazing I
haven't purchased earrings or just even
received earrings and so so long and I
cannot wait to wear these
yesterday I warned these from that bread
as well they're just these dangly
beautiful gold earrings I wore them
yesterday for the 4th of July and then
I'm wearing them again today I'm so
obsessed I don't know if I'm pronouncing
this name right either I'm so bad at
pronouncing names which is Mayor ooh
Minoru I could be pronouncing it wrong
but if anyone knows look how cute their
packaging is this is an amazing necklace
it's an evil eye blue silver necklace
and it is perfect for layering with
anything I hope you guys can see that
I saw Kylie Jenner wore a necklace just
like this or it was this exact necklace

can't wait to wear it
