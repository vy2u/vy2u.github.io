video with you I do not think you
understand so I went on to triangle
swimwear which is a website only online
it's an Australian brands and all their
bikinis are made out of neoprene
material which is the same material
wetsuits are made out of in this video I
will be wearing the bikini I thought it
would be nice if you guys could see it
on me while I'm reviewing a product this
is the new bandy collection I think it's
only a limited edition as well and I got
this shade sure plum I'm a super super
excited to show this to you so when you
do get your bikini does come with a bag
as you can see in here I will be showing
you guys the pros and cons about this
entire company and stuff like that
so to start off here's the bag the
bikini comes in it's super cute just a
traditional Jost rating bag I'm going to
show you guys the top first here is the
top I got size extra small on my bra
size is 32 BC anywhere around there the
reason why I got extra small you like
the wondering is because the strap that
goes around your waist we're going to be
like a 32 or 34 in your bra size this is
not adjustable it just opens it just has
a clasp on the back which is a really
durable clasp it just clasp open and
shut so that's really nice
absolute no on the website now they have
sizes extra extra small to extra large
what is covering the coral and the blue
beautiful blue color assay is a fishnet
material and this is so comfortable this
is the most comfortable bikini I've ever
worn this is not push up there isn't any
padding but nothing's going to show
through because it's a thick enough
material that nothing will show through
triangle has done an awesome job
updating their bikinis and now anything
with this type of bathing suit top the
straps are adjustable
allelujah alright so here the bikini
bottoms they're in this gorgeous purpley
color I love the material that they're
made out
just so you guys know this particular
bikini in the bamboo collection is made
out of super stretchy neoprene so it
doesn't cut into your body as much and
it's not as thick and it's so much
softer than the other key knees that I
have the material like the nuclear
material itself I love how these bottoms
are made they are made so durable and if
you guys notice the straps on the sides
are little thinner which I love so much
because I know that my other bikini that
is a Cloe design the bottoms are so
thick but I love how big thin the side
straps on this particular bikini will
the bus is full coverage which is really
nice it's not-it's not cheeky at all I
got says extra small for bottoms I am a
size double zero to one or two in jeans
I don't know if that really helps but if
someone's on the edge about what size
bottoms you should order just go a size
up or what you think you are they also
have an online chat which is really
really helpful on their website which I
love and the fest I love this tag these
are expensive bikinis they are so worth
in they're very durable I do have two
other triangle bikinis I would link my
review to that video down below in the
description box so you can watch that as
well the only downside to this website
is shipping is $20 if you live in the
u.s. I don't know about other states or
other countries I mean neoprene can
crease and mark very easily so you
always on a story bikini flat and take
special care of it when wearing and
washing your bikini you will get this
piece of paper it is just for returns
and it shows you how to return an order
it seems pretty easy but I do know you
have to pay for shipping when you return
something okay so the one bad thing I
have to say about this entire bikini
brand is the bags that they come in
because you can never put a lot of stuff
in the bag which is super frustrating
because when I took this to the beach I
packed it full with items and this broke
off the fabric that holds the straps
onto the actual bag are so fine and
fragile beds
and it's it just broke and it's annoying
so when you if you do order try the
bikini and you'd want to use this back
for long time only put your bikini in it
or sup hair sunglasses or maybe your
wallet sunglasses in your bikini or I
know what I actually I realized that it
broke I put like only a t-shirt mascara
because I was very much scared to the
beach and my bikini when it needed to
dry flat I wasn't near flat surface or
something weird like that I don't know
what I'm talking about
but otherwise I love everything about
this brand they do an awesome job I
could great about these bikinis for days
on end they're my favorite type of
bikinis I think the material that
they're made out of is slimming to every
person's body type and which was really
nice so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I loved making it thank you
so much for watching I hope you guys
have a wonderful day please give this
video a thumbs up because I loved making
it and I really hope it helps if anyone
was looking online at the Bambi bathing
suits that just came out recently
actually they're like oh I totally want
to get one of those but I need to taste
someone to review on the first I'm glad
I could help I hope you guys just have a
wonderful day and my Twitter and
scrambling to double description box
please follow me and subscribe to my
youtube channel be havin already I would
love that so bye guys have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
