video today and as you guys can tell by
reading my description box below it is
going to be a triangle swimwear review
video art the first triangle bikini that
I did purchase is called Arizona sunset
and I believe it is a Chloe design I
could be totally wrong but I will link
everything down in my description box
look so here is the drawstring bag that
the bikini
did come in it is 100% made a real cream
and it's very durable this is like a
burnt orange color and I have used mine
so much that it's already dirty someone
stepped on it bottoms get shipped in
this just plastic bag with the name
tribal in on it
so the bottoms are just like this and
then the fact this they are not cheeky
they are full coverage which is really
nice here's inside bottoms the tag is
here I did get size extra small because
I'm a very petite person and I wear size
double zero to one and James they don't
really stretch a lot so I would
recommend maybe getting the size up
depending on the size James you are they
also have a live chat on the website
which is very helpful and you can talk
to one of the people that work there and
they will tell you what size that you
need the top came in this triangle
plastic bag fold on this and I did get a
size small in this top because I am bra
size at 32 B now there is no padding in
this top it's just a thick layer of
neoprene so you don't have to worry
about anything showing this is
adjustable with its strings and then at
the end of the strings they have these
mm weights I would say um they're just
black matte material and they say
triangle on the end this bikini was $79
plus $20 for shipping totally worth it
it's very durable and I just love the
way these look on the body I seen them
all over tumblr and instagram and
twitter and i just had to have one for
the next bikini that I have this is
called Billy Firefly alright here is the
top for the Billy Firefly now this top I
did get an extra small because the
straps are non adjustable it's just a
slip on like a t-shirt this is like
fishnet material and then this is like a
burnt orange underneath this is the most
comfortable baby
um it fits perfectly I love it so this
is an extra so now for these bottoms
they are so cute because they're this
shining cat color and then I did get
extra small for the bottom so here's
this shiny material and the Sun actually
sparkles and it looks very beautiful
here's the bag this bikini came in these
bikinis for $79 plus $20 shipping so I
the total I spent on these bikinis were
a hundred and seventy eight dollars
together the company for triangle is an
Australian brand and it is only online I
recommend that people go and purchase
these bathing suits they are beautiful
and they are made 100 cent of neoprene
material and triangle has done an
amazing job with creating such nice
bikini wear thank you so much for taking
the time to watch this video give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it give it a
thumbs down if you didn't please

should see more videos from me in the
future bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
