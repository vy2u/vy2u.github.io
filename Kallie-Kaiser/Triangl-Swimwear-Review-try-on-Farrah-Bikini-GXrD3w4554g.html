I'm going reviewing one of the triangle
swimwear bikinis I have reviewed some of
their bikinis in the past so I will link
those videos down below in the
description box and in the description
box as well you will also find my
Twitter my Instagram and my snapchat
snapchat it's just Callie and and then
for Instagram and Twitter for both
social medias it's just at colonizer but
the bikini I'm going to be reviewing
today is the fara blue California navy
blue crochet neoprene um this bikini has
become very popular as it is one of the
newer collections so let's go for the
bikini top I have a size small with me
and it fits me perfect on the bra size
of 32 see the straps are adjustable and
then the bust or the width right here is
not it's just kind of like a clasp
almost like a seatbelt type class it's
really durable it's not going to come
undone I know if you go online now and
you're going to pick out a bikini the
sizes are extra extra small to extra
large now and they have oh they never
used to have such a wide variety of
sizes which i think is great and then I
love the new bikini designs I think
they're so beautiful and they photograph
so nicely with the crochet I haven't
worn the crochet bikinis in the water
yet so I don't know how they are over a
period of time I know my other family
bikini it kind of has started to fray a
bit but I've worn it more than eight
times to a beach for the bottoms I have
a size small with me I am obsessed with
triangles bottoms because even though I
do like cheeky bikini bottoms these are
full coverage which is nice for people
that enjoy full coverage in the past I
have always ordered an extra small
because my hip in inches is 30 to 31
inches I think I would continue to get
extra small because now that they've
updated their neoprene or another
neoprene is so much softer and it's
super stretch these never used to
stretch the way they do now especially
with the old Chloe designs if you order
any triangle design type of kini
anything
out a cup size you are going to get a
bag with it and this is the bag that
came with the fara blue California
native blue bikini these bags are
specifically made to hold your bikini
and dry them flat because they are
neoprene and they do crease easy so you
want to make sure you always store them
flat and air dry them flat and never
machine wash them ever they always
should be air dried and hand wash so a
lot of weights can't be placed in these
bag because the seam or the material
that holds the straps on the bag will
break and it's not as strong as you
think I am obsessed with most of them
your collections I cannot believe how
well they have updated their bikinis
this neoprene is so much softer than the
originally Chloe design bikini that I
have and the neoprene is a lot thicker
I'm just really amazed and impressed
overall if you guys ever have any
questions with sizing or anything if you
go onto triangles actual website they
have a live chat that's open 24 hours
and that's probably the best place to go
because they are people that work there
only downside to the triangle swimwear
is sand does get caught in your bikini
bottoms if you're going to be rolling
around on a beach if you are wearing
this bikini to a beach avoid rolling
around in the sand or sitting directly
on sand just make sure you're always
sitting on a towel because these are
expensive bikinis and you probably don't
want a little specks of sand to be
placed like on your bum or just like all
over I know um when I was at the ocean
last night were I got sand in the bikini
I was able to pick them out but it's
just a little tedious and takes time
that's about all I have to say I love
this brand so much umm I have purchased
all my triangle bikinis with my own
money so if you can't afford these
zucchinis I would say buy them they're
so beautiful and they last
long time they are durable thank you
guys so much for taking time to watch
this video I really hope you enjoyed it
