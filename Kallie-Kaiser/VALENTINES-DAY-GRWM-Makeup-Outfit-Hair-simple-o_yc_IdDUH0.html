we are doing ask you get ready with me
on this entire look I did my hair my
makeup and my outfit free bias if you
want to know how to do any of this and
just keep watching we did a little bit
of a really warm smoky eye with a lot of
highlighter just a fun girly ponytail
and then we kind of made an edgy sexy
Valentine's Day outfit but I definitely
be wearing this occasion I along and
bought a steak house tonight which we
are I can't begin on Valentine's Day
because even Arizona at U of A and I'm
here at Santa Monica College so I will
see you soon though I meant I might be
going on a ball nest date so I hope you
guys have a lovely Valentine's Day and
we all so much if you want to follow me
on my Instagram at colonizer but I'm
very excited to get into this video so
here we go okay I just got a shower so
my skin is still really read so
exfoliating but my primer that I'm going
to be putting on my face is the Marc
Jacobs invisible undercover primer it
exploded as on the airplane I haven't
cleaned it up feeling really lazy but I
usually do about one pump of this I
supplied into rub it into my hand and if
there's any left overs bring it down
with that 300 is my favorite primer is
because look how hydrating my skin looks
now or hydrated my skin looks and then I
like to go on with the glam glow plump
plump rages gloss lip treatment look how
cool this opened up and I put this on to
prepare I lift
so our lipstick later on cause it's
super glossy and it makes your lips feel
like they bigger than they are for
foundation today I'm going to do a
locket Kat Von D Foundation and my shade
is the light for for cool I love a
foundation it's so full coverage I do
about one pump on my hands and today I'm
using my Real Techniques Beauty Blender
Julie dirty
the cleaning and as you can see I have a
lot of redness below into the set time
of the month where you just get a lot of
bad skin bones
let me know what you guys are doing for
Valentine's Day today I always want to
know what everyone is planned for
Valentine's Day ahead are only
celebrated Valentine's Day
super hardcore with a boyfriend yes
because long distance sucks so much if
you guys have watched any might make to
us before you know that I love by my
undereye by it cosmetics I'm using a
shade light and medium my next time
underneath my eyes and this stuff
doesn't get cakey on me either which I
love and then whatever leftover on the
brush I kind of run it down the ridge of
my nose as well and move you've won this
in you can also put the rest on your I
was as well that was good beauty blend
Oh what I would do is a beauty blunder
honestly
to time I face I'm using to you laura
mercier trans with the powder one of the
best I'm just taking a black fluffy
brush to set my face with this and I do
not set my entire face with the things
I've really dry skin already and the
foundation I use is very matte and
drying so kind of that happen kind of
set my whole face in it really want to
start I love so I'm going to go right on
to my eyebrows I'm using the itch brow
power it just has a spoolie on one side
and then an applicator I can twist it
out on this side so I just assume the
elbows my eyebrows and I lightly run
this through because that's just what I
do
and then I'm just taking my la-z-boy
brow and I'm just going to run this
through my eyebrows so it sets properly
and today we're using the modern a
renaissance palette looks like this
absolutely gorgeous has really warm
beautiful colors that we're going to be
putting our eyes I highly recommend to
purchase it and then i'm using the estee
lauder metallic shadow cream plus powder
this will blow your mind it is amazing I
literally just pick it up at Sephora and
it's gold glitter on the side so you
guys just going to be blown out of your
seat wherever you're sitting to start
the blog I'm just dipping into the
whitest shade in the palette I know I
already sat in my eyes but I just like
to use this with a white base I find the
shadows blend better for our transition
shade today I'm using the Laura Mercier
candle light loose powder dis powder is
amazing to use the highlight as well it
looks like this super gorgeous kind of
like a rose gold
for the main color eyeshadow I'm taking
this morphe e17 brush and I'm just
dipping it into this red color it's so
so beautiful so when you put it on your
outer corner in your corner just create
this amazing holo effect in the middle
and that's where we're going to be
putting the glitter for the look
also these colors just make your eyes
pop like they have never before because
my eyes are definitely not this blue
just take those shades and you're just
going to drag them underneath your lower
lash line and then I also like to take
this small brush and you could take any
dark brown color you have in any palette
and I just run this on the outer corner
of the eye and it just smells it up a
little bit now for the best part of the
entire makeup look this is the Estee
Lauder metallic eye shadow cream plum
powder in the shade oh three scarlet and
Eclipse I found this at Sephora actually
a friend found of communites for and
it's the greatest thing ever so I'm just
taking this Real Techniques brush and
I'm just dipping into the cream and I'm
just placing this all over my entire lid
wherever I wanted glitter to stick
as you can see I'm not really good at
applying the cream you can apply really
less you doesn't have to be perfect
because you're going to be putting
glitter over on top of it and always
looks a little bit better with overdrawn
sometimes
is this not the most beautiful glitter
you've ever seen it just create the best
chrome effect with gold and red
undertones
I'm absolutely just obsessed with it and
if you get any underneath your under eye
to just take your setting brush that you
use and then wipe away really easy and
then to complete the eye look I take my
Mac soft and gentle highlighter on just
this Sephora highlighting brush please
click this and I toss off the top of the
eye shadow look with this and it gives
it just a beautiful glowing effect which
I live for you can do this with any eye
shadow look and it looks so pretty
my eyes look so terrifying right now but
I promise you the end result will not
look like this so I'm just using this
next box contour kit and contour shade
on this Real Techniques brush
and this why there are things ever I'm
talking about this in my makeup no
makeup tutorial look this is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder and
shave dim light you guys can see how
pale this looks but I actually contour
with it on a regular basis and it just
kind of adds some warmth to the contour
and then for bronzer I'm just using the
Marc Jacobs tantric bronzer this is vo
mega bronze and I'm taking this both
flawless face brush from bender bare
minerals this bronzer is just the best
shade favorite part of the entire look
at highlighter Sun is taking the Mac
soft and gentle oh my god this moon all
completed on I like that this
highlighter is in this powdery so it
gives it a wet highlighter look please
since it is Valentine's Day I want to
throw in a little pink so I'm using the
Bobbi Brown shimmer brick palette and it
just has a bunch of cool shimmer brick
so I'm going to use a light pink one and
the like lush and then for mascara I'm
taking you roller lash from benefit and
you can do as many layers as you want
with this here you can even throw in
some falsies just because this is such
an extreme I look and for lip products
today I'm using the velocity a shade and
Cape is just a really nice lip you stick
it's a really great new color and on top
of that I'm putting the lip Maximizer um
do your this gloss on top and we shade
0:06
this is one of my new favorite lip
glosses ever I also love putting lip
gloss on
eyelids - can we see that but after I am
- the look is complete and I hope you
guys enjoy the naked portion of this
video next I'll show you guys what I'm
going to be doing with my hair and then
I'll show you my outfit so here we go
for the super easy ponytail I'm showing
you guys today I'm just brushing my hair
out and leaving it in a little part I've
been wearing the middle part for the
longest time ever I'm taking my nume
cruel Jam and I'm using the largest
barrel that this set comes with and
separating my hair into one-inch
sections and just wrap it around the
barrel you guys can see this usually
takes me around 5 to 10 minutes to do
super quick and easy and I don't end up
using any hairspray because the barrel
gets so hot the curls stay in my hair
really well I don't like when curls are
super tight so I brush them out so that
they look more like Beach waves and
they're super flowy and beautiful so
once you brush your hair out you can
choose various brand
I don't like hairspray so I'm not going
to and then I just separate some pieces
out from my ponytail and then you're
just going to put your hair up like a
normal ponytail and the trick in the
back is to tighten it up to the desired
height that you want kind of like a
barbie ponytail that makes sense and
moving on to our outfits this is my
favorite part I'm obsessed so I decided
to wear all black
I know it's Valentine's Day but whatever
my jewelry is from Adina's jewels I'll
have their Instagram and website link

layered gold necklace right here is from

from princess Holly I believe that 20%
off with princess Polly I'll leave a
code in the description I think it's

check mixing textures so I decide to
wear fishnet tights and these amazing
patent leather booties that are from
princess Polly as well and I get cold at
night so I just to run a leather jacket
