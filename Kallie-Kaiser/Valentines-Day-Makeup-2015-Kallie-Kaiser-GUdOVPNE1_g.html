want to do a Valentine's Day inspired
makeup look which a nice lipstick so
that is why I have so much makeup on
right now plus fake eyelashes I'm really
excited to share this video with you
guys I hope you enjoy it and just you
know I did myself on my eyeliner and
this eye when I was doing the makeup
tutorials so not amazing and makeup
mistakes happen yeah let's get into it
first we are going to take our stay
don't stray eye primer from benefit and
we're just going to be applying this all
over our lid now use a piece of tape and
apply it like you're extending your
lower lash line then we are using this
color tattoo by eye studio in white to
use as a base for the rest of our eye
shadow
then from the world-famous neutrals
palette from benefit we are taking the
shade pause for applause and we're going
to be really packing this all over our
eye for a transition shape now we are
taking the shade buzz from The Naked 3
palette or just going to be dusting this
on our lower brow bone we are using mac
fix+ and spraying it on a pal brush and
then dipping it into our Naked 1 palette
using the shades syn or going to be
applying this all over our lid when we
put mac fix+ on it it foils it and makes
it a super shock I shut up
this shade is actually a blush from
Oprah cosmetics in the shade paradise
pink we are taking it on a smaller
crease brush and dusting it in the outer
corner and inner crease of our eye
taking our fluffy brush one last time
we're just going to dust all the colors
into each other now taking our
fantabulous gel eyeliner in the shade
blue black you're going to try and make
a cat eye obviously I did not succeed
now taking our Tarina Tarantino olicity
glitter liner you're going to be
applying this on the top of the glue
black I like
from our world-famous neutrals palette
from benefit we are taking this shade
raincheck and putting it on a very small
crease brush and applying it underneath
our lower lash line then taking this
shimmery white pigment from bellapierre
cosmetics we are dusting this on our
brow bone and inner corner and using it
as our highlight
and of course fake eyelashes I got these
from ELF and they're just the dramatic
lash kit
the mascara I will be using is the
lights camera lashes mascara from Tarte
and we're just packing this on our upper
lashes and lower lashes I'm using my 4
tribulation Lake ran in the shade char
bond and applying this to my waterline
now taking this perfect lip pencil from
beauty for real I'm going to be
outlining my lips and as you guys can
see I kind of over draw the bottom lip
it's because I want to accentuate it
more than the top and then for the last
step we are taking this Mac matte
lipstick in the shade people and putting
this on top of the lip liners
