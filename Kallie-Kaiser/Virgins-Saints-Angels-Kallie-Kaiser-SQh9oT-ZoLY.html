hey guys it's Cal in today's video I'm
so beyond excited to share it with you
guys it is entirely going to be about
VSA designs virgin saints and angels
they are sold at select retail outlets
such as Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom
this is all handcrafted luxury if you
haven't heard of this jewelry brand
before and if you have you might be
following them on some of their social
media such as Instagram which I'm also
so excited to share with you guys and go
about I will be taking over VSA designs
Instagram and leave the date right here
so you guys can go and give them a
follow I will be falling back some of
the first few hundred which is so
exciting I'll be posting all of my own
individual photos how I style the
jewelry and how I wear it with my
wardrobe you also see that in this video
so if you just keep watching it's gonna
be so fun
this is one of my favorite halos I
actually wore this to Lollapalooza as
well
it is so intricate in detail and
beautiful it photographs so nice if you
guys are ever like looking to go to a
festival or anything and you're looking
for the perfect end piece I highly
recommend virgins things and angels
halos or any of their hair accessories
they're all beautiful this one is one of
my favorites it is absolutely gorgeous
what's super cool is when you look at
their crowns or halos or any of their
hair accessories they're so beautiful in
person and it's so amazing to think that
someone made this handcrafted which is
just super cool
my favorite collections is the santel
collection I mean just look how
beautiful these beads are and then these
are the Santo rosaries these are
absolutely gorgeous pieces that can be
worn together separate with other
different collections as well and if you
guys don't know VSA also uses only the
best custom crystals and features a
beautiful range of natural stones beads
and pearls and they also use bronze
coated in 24 karat gold as well as
sterling silver and Vermeil so some of
the pieces that I'm wearing right now is
Santa collection I'm wearing the Santa
cuff and then I'm also wearing this
super adorable delicate Santa bracelet
and then I'm wearing this Bernando cuff
I believe is how to pronounce which is
like look how chic this is and then my
necklaces I am wearing both Santa
rosaries I'm just wearing the large
beaded and then a smaller beaded one
here what I love about the jewelry's
everything is double sided so everything
is very detailed because it is a
handcrafted luxury so no matter which
way you flip it or wear it it's always
gonna be detailed on both sides one of
my other favorite pieces is their wraps
oh my gosh I could not read them enough
about these you could wear them as a
bracelet a layered necklace long
necklace the short necklace you can even
wear these as a belts as a ankle
bracelet you could go crazy just layer
them up or just so awesome and these
look amazing by themselves or mixed with
other different collections I know I
have worn this with these bracelets
before which is super cute and I love
that the crosses are gold and as well as
silver I love that they mix gold and
silver I think that is so in and it's so
chic at the same time what's really
awesome about VSA is people get to
express their own style because
everything is so versatile so you can
basically wear whatever you want however
you would like for moving on to the San
Benito
Delina which is so cool they have so
many different designs and crystal
colors and different symbols with this
specific Magdalena it is more multiple
ways oh my gosh I absolutely adore it
also comes with a Magdalena extender so
that you can wear it multiple ways so
the first way that you can wear it is
you unclip this grab the top put it on
then you have a longer necklace piece
and then once you take that off if you
attach the Magdalena extender you can
wear it multiple different ways and you
guys can see or if you just wear it like
this and hook it normally in the back
it's just as gorgeous this is one of my
favorite pieces and I think organ saints
and angels is probably very well-known
with this piece of jewelry which is so
neat the next collection that I want to
share with you guys is the piccolo
collection I think this is probably one
of my favorite collections because you
could wear these necklaces by themselves
or layer together because again you can
wear them multiple different ways you
can wear them as a choker or as a longer
necklace piece which I absolutely adore
I've layered all three of these up at
once and I've gotten crazy compliments
on them I think they're so just simple
and elegant at the same time this one is
like a gunmetal a sterling silver and
then a gold or rose gold and then I have
some amazing studs that go with peopleö
collection as well that are rose gold
and it has the same Veneto symbol in the
middle and which is for protection and
those that are trying to find peace of
mind or a peace of heart they also have
some amazing cops in the piccolo
collection I am wearing the rose gold
and the sterling silver one now these
look amazing layered or separate as well
I could not rave enough about VSA
designs rings they have an amazing
collection of rings the for virgins ring
it's so cool like everything
on the hands just look amazing it's just
a square with poor virgins and then it
has these beautiful crystals in the
middle this is the resurrection Mary
it's just an awesome like brassy gap
like dark metal color and then I love
this picolo ring I love it love it love
it I think it's so beautiful so for
Virgin saints and angels with such a
blend of Gothic and classy and edgy and
elegant designs symbols of protection
and good fortune creates unique
statement pieces that both provide
spiritual and fashion-forward vibes
which is so cool and also the essay is
so versatile it gives the customers a
chance to just show their own personal
style and every single piece that they
wear but I love about most of their
collections is most pieces necklaces
bracelets everything can be worn
multiple ways which i think is so
amazing because people love to layer
nowadays layering is so in and VSA is
all about layering and showing gold and
silver together and then really bronzy
accents thank you guys so much for
