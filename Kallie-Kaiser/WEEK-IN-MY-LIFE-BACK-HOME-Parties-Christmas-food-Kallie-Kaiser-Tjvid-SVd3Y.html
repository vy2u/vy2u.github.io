we are tired today
I just blogged my week en maybe a full
week maybe a little bit less than a full
week who knows we'll see what happens it
is snowing not anymore but it was
earlier and I'm craving to go sledding
today so I think that's gonna happen hi
Kayla and I are starving so we're gonna
make some food are you just staring out
the window
hey mr. meehan how are you what's up man
are you a chiller like me hey guys so
for lunch today Kayla and I are going to
be making a hella fresh meal I'm so
excited
if you've watched my videos before
you've definitely heard of hellofresh
but if you haven't hellofresh it's just
a meal kit delivery service and it makes
cooking so much more fun so you can
focus on the whole experience and not
just the final plate my favorite thing
about this is that they deliver the food
to your doorstep in a recyclable
insulated box every meal is less than
ten dollars a meal so we have all of our
ingredients laid out which one are we
making we are making no-fuss pesto
chicken with potatoes green salad each
meal takes around 30 minutes I'm gonna
start making these potatoes every meal
comes with steps and you just follow
them it's super easy so first I'm going
to preheat and prep roast potatoes YUM
another really cool thing is hello fresh
sources from the freshest ingredients
and everything is measured to exact
quantities so there is no food waste
which is amazing okay I just made the
potatoes and now I'm gonna put them
the oven putting these in for like 20 to
25 minutes okay we're adding the pesto
on the chicken
very happy you here ok we just finished
yum-yum-yum ready oh my gosh it looks so
good yeah look at this goodness the best
part about whole afresh is that it's
just so perfect for everyone's lifestyle
you guys know when I'm back in LA I'm
really busy and I don't have a bunch of
time to go grocery shopping so it's
really nice to just throw a meal
together and then when I'm back home my
family and I are able to just whip a
meal together as well in like 30 minutes
so it's perfect for on-the-go lifestyle
or at home life that's why I love
hellofresh so much and what's really
awesome is you guys can get $30 off your
first week of deliveries if you just go
to hellofresh comm and enter the promo
code calli 30 when you subscribe
