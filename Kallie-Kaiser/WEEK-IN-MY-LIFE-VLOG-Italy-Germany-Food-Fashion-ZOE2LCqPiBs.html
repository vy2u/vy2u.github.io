reads to you audibles content literally

currently reading dark matter by Blake
Crouch holy cow is absolutely so amazing
my sister read it and literally one day
it's such a page-turner and then she
recommended to me and now I do
so audible is really great for me
because I am a super slow reader so I
never enjoyed reading so I'm so happy
that I'm able to listen to an audiobook
and finish it both the same time as my
sister since I'm always on the go I
always just plug my phone into bluetooth
I Drive a lot or I'll just pop
headphones in it doesn't matter and I
can listen to the book while I'm driving
the car or road tripping as I am right
now on a plane doesn't matter it just
helps pass time this book is so good
