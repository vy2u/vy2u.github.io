we are talking strictly about food I
love food so much I'm such a foodie I
told him to leave you are when you eat
so I'm really excited to bring you guys
what I eat a day and I'm also excited to
announce and I have partnered with the
app like some on this video but I will
definitely get into that app and talk
about in a little bit
wow if you follow me on snapchat or my
Instagram you see my stories you know
how much I post about food every single
day so if you're a foodie totally follow
me on my Instagram is a sh hyzer and my
snapchat is italian if you want to look
at my stories and stuff on there but
without further ado I love paint this
video so here we go the second I wake up
I head right to the kitchen I just want
to get my metabolism going I want to
hydrate my body
drink some water so I grab a glass of
water I love room-temperature water I
say when you're drinking water and then
you're freezing because it has so much
ice in it so I call myself about lemon I
love lemons I you see them by themselves
it's random fact about me
so after that yum drink some water and
I'm hungry I'm starving for breakfast so
today we are going to be making papaya
and yogurt with chia seeds and granola
so the first thing you're obviously
going to need is papaya I actually had
to watch a YouTube video on how to cut
this up but this is absolutely my
favorite fruit ever and it is so easy to
prepare and it's so good for you so good
for your skin you can totally Google all
the benefits about how good papayas for
you but trust me I love it it's amazing
so after I cut it up into chunks you
guys can see me cutting it up here is
very self-explanatory I grab myself a
bowl or anything you will put it on a
plate that's soy fine my yogurt is from
Trader Joe's could see the brand right
here if I scoop my Greek yogurt into my
bowl once I scoop my Pyatt
into my bowl on top of my yogurt I like
to store away my container in the fridge
and I eat papaya throughout the rest of
the day I know you don't want to eat a
whole bunch at once because it does have
a lot of fiber so if you're constipated
eat papaya it's amazing after that I'll
just sprinkle on some granola this is
vanilla granola I got an old food so
good
I just add some chia seeds on there
honestly this is such a good breakfast
and it fills me up so yummy I probably
eat this three or four times a week and
then other times I'll just poach an egg
or just cook two egg sunny-side up under
al Qaeda or something
so after that I would probably have a
snack these are some of the snacks that
I love snacking on I love Laura barns
believe they're called Rosa Parks anyway
I love these vanilla bars they're so
good so good for you I love banana chips
I also snack on nuts I indeed all at
Trader Joe's as well oh my gosh I love
snacks out there really easy to just hop
in my hop in my backpack they're really
easy to just throw my backpack bring to
class and then eat without the teacher
know it's going to yell at me okay guys
now that we've eaten our breakfast and
snacks for the day I really want to show
you guys how amazing this app like some
in so right when I open it up it shows
me my diary also there's a button right
next to the diary essence friends you
can totally add me on there to be
friends it's amazing so if you're
looking to just get motivated and stay
healthier this app is amazing seem to
sustain weight maintain weight or lose
weight by tracking your calories your
exercise all the food that you're eating
which is so amazing and really
beneficial you are we youi honestly so
if I scroll down here it shows that I
can import my breakfast my launch my
dinner my snap even my exercise there is
also a water intake meter which tells
you is that how many fluid ounces of
water you're drinking today
they also have a fruit and vegetable
tracker that is awesome okay so I
already drinking three glasses of water
today if you can add water take away
water okay and then up here I'm going to
show you guys how you can add food into
it which is really cool by using this
thing called the scan barcode so I just
had more food and I did eat trail mix
today for my snack in class and right
here I just hit scan barcodes and you
will just and the barcode of for example
I buy my groceries at Trader Joe's so it
just pops up and you can add it into
your diary it's really nice my breakfast
here even tells we have 46 calories
under my breakfast goal was also so
amazing on here and they have this thing
called the like core test
and once you answer the very question
you can actually get tailored feedback
on how to have a healthier lifestyle
from the experts at license which I just
think is really cool and then what's
really nice is I can go over here to
recipes and you can literally type in
anything here let's say you're vegan or
you're gluten-free or you're in a
vegetarian you're looking for low-sodium
it tells you so many different recipes
and they are all so amazing I always
struggle with what we make today what do
I make tomorrow I don't even know what
I'm going to do an hour from now this is
amazing because it's right here you can
just click on a recipe and it told you
exactly what you need it tells you
exactly many calories in it and there's
just hundreds and hundreds of healthy
recipes which is so amazing I really
just wear this shirt out to be guys just
because I struggled a lot with
dehydration I just wanted it drinking a
lot of water I was literally a camel and
this has helped me so much by tracking
how much ounces of water and drinking
today so I hope this is really
beneficial to you and if you guys want
to download it just click the link down
below description box moving on really
wasn't that hungry today for lunch so I
just decided to make a little burrata
platter which is the freshest form of
mozzarella if you don't know what bra is
I have to order anytime it's an
appetizer at a restaurant it's my
favorite thing ever so what you're going
to need I use kale I use olive oil salt
and pepper I actually just ran out of
coconut oil so that's why I'm
substituting olive oil also olive oil is
so good I don't know if it's good for
you it's really good and then I also put
tomatoes on there I had crostini I
usually add avocado but I ran out of
avocado and I forgot to buy some more at
the store idiot this is so simple it
literally takes me five minutes I get my
plate out I put my kale on my plate I
cut up some Tomatoes put some on there
after that I either plop some breads and
crostini on there I love crostini so
good and then I just pop my big thing of
burrata right in the center and I
sprinkle it with salt and pepper and
then I put my olive oil all over it
again I usually add coconut oil but
olive oil is what we're using today and
I'm just again I think this is so good I
usually add avocado so that's why it's
definitely missing something if you're
wondering what it's missing that's what
it's missing
moving on dinner as you can see just how
amazing does this look so we're making
chicken with pesto and butternut squash
cool so excited okay I make this a lot
honestly I'm not sick of it yet the day
I get sick of it I'll be really sad so I
got this chicken pesto bar squash
everything at Trader Joe's Trader Joe's
has such free prices so if you're
looking for somewhere to grocery shop
I'm definitely go there because they do
have really good organic and healthy
choices as well anyway compare your
chicken I just put salt and pepper on it
I also usually can cover a little bit of
it in coconut oil and put some olive oil
on there because I didn't have coconut
oil and I just plop that on the stove
let it cook I kind of think I did seven
minutes on each side I could be wrong I
don't remember but on medium-high and
then I just got a bowl out and I put
coconut oil on the butternut squash with
salt and pepper again I had to use olive
oil because I didn't have coconut oil
and you just mix it around
put it on a cookie sheet or anything
that you have like a nonstick pan
anything plop in the oven for 25 minutes
what's really nice about this butternut
squash that has the instructions on the
back and then once both of those are
done cooking you just put the chicken on
the plate and then scoop pesto on the
plate and then put butternut squash on
top of the pesto so they're kind of like
mix it around really good and then I
also love to incorporate soy off you
sauce Wow
I love marinating soy rocky I mean I
love marinating chicken into a cute
sauce but I also love how strong this
off is to kind of just pour on the plate
and it lifts the bottom of the chicken
just absorb the sauce and it's so good
so yeah this dinner is so simple so easy
I'm not a mazing cook I don't have to
prepare meat so this is what I do and
this is what works for me so I really
hope you guys love this portion of
dinner it was really good if your
wandering here are just some desserts
that I love if I do eat ice cream all
the time as well and then I also about
these mega bars that I get at Trader
Joe's they are so good and they have
cream on the side so when you are eating
it like peaches and cream kind of flavor
I don't know feel amazing but for
tonight for dessert we are making frozen
raspberries and your Stribling is hell
on there I got these bolts at trager's
as well so they're mikela isn't named
brand Nutella but it is almond cocoa
butter and it tastes exactly the same
probably even better than a hazelnut
Nutella Wow this is so good so easy and
it's honestly not that bad for you
so if you're trying to stay away from
misters I would recommend this or just
mixing together mangoes and pineapples
with water or coconut water and ice and
it becomes kind of just like a frozen
drink smoothie and it should subside
your craving for dessert that's just
what I did and it's not that many
calories so if you're weird about
calories I highly recommend that but yes
amazing I hope you guys loved all these
desserts I hope you loved everything I
ate today if you ever need more advice
