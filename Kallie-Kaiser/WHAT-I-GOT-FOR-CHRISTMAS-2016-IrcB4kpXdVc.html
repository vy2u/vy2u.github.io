what's in my stocking we just hang these
up over fireplaces every year and then
my dad always put scratch-offs in our
stockings which is honestly probably my
favorite thing I don't know what I
wanted but one year I'm 120 bucks and I
thought I was the richest person alive I
think that was like five years ago and I
also got some gift cards
I got a squirrel gift card and a Norse
Rome's gift card I'm recently so
obsessed with before that I finally am
now a vib ruj and I constantly am buying
stuff there's dojo guys and then my
older sister got my little sister and I

bracelets that are aren't wrists I'm
wearing right now so I guarantee it is
the longitude and latitude so the
coordinates of our house so this is
probably my favorite thing I got it's

a piece of paper but I got the new
powershot g7x blog camera and I'm so

sugary oh this one's so heavy okay so
since my mom goes I'm always editing

parents got me these amazing leather
pants from North Sean's I think they're
from Topshop

that mom style but they also fit really
tight around the waist in butt area but
I'm really obsessive and there's some
knives dippers going on and then my
older sister Hannah got me these awesome
