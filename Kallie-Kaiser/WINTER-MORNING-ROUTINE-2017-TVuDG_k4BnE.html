to my channel I hope you guys are having
a lovely day or night whenever you guys
decide to watch this video so here's
just some fake clips of me sleeping that
I filmed for you guys but what actually
does happen is still a welcome in the
morning she'll step on me or purse face
in my face she really just wants me to
play with her but it's the highlight of
my morning whenever she wakes me up it's
the best alarm clock you could ever have
and then once I kind of wake up a little
bit I always reach my phone and go
through my social medias to find out
what I missed throughout the night first
I'll take up snapchat and do some good
morning snaps of Stella just because
she's an actual human and if you want to
follow me on snapchat just Callaghan and
then I like to go through Instagram
instagrams on my favorite apps ever I'm
just liking all my space lately I've
been live chatting a lot so you can
follow me on Instagram which is actually
concerning will not miss out on those
live streams and then I was hoping my
youtuber creators app just because it
shows me analytics online videos are
doing all the people that are commenting
so if you guys ever leave comment or
subscribe I actually love you and thank
you so much so after I get all my social
medias done I like to open up my fav
news game called best fiends thank you
so much for us beans for sponsoring this
video so you guys may or may not have
heard of best beans I meet YouTube
community so far but if you don't know
best beans is a free puzzle adventure
game where you can collect and upgrade
characters by matching the same color
objects to the speak of slugs so if you
guys see me sliding the leaves or the
raindrops and the mushrooms those are
what go to the characters to defeat the
slugs it's amazing and make sure to
apply all the magical character quests
doing exciting and exclusive prizes such
as gold disinvesting winged gold I'm not
kidding and now there's actually a
character quest every 50 level starting
at level 100 and don't forget to connect
the game to Facebook to compete with all
your best friends through the new and
amazing leaderboards I'm actually on
level 38
it shows level 32 right now because I've
been playing it well all night long you
can try and beat me and tell me what
level you're on but don't forget to
download the game for free and the link
in my description
box and if you download it now you'll
get $4.99 worth of gold and diamonds for
free if you do make it to level 10 and
it trust me girl you're going to want
that gold enjoyment when it gets to the
harder levels and then once I finally
just decide to get out of it and start
my day before I go brush my teeth and
wash my face I'll hang out with still a
little bit longer just because she's my
best friend and I have nothing better to
do
so we're just being obnoxious I don't
know even what I was doing in this video
and then I'm just going to head to the
bathroom to brush my teeth and wash my
knees
okay for my face wash I use this every
morning and night when I'm not
exfoliating it to see and vino
complexion clear cleanser I love it so
much it's really great for sensitive
skin and I also have normal to dry skin
if you guys are looking for a skin care
routine for me it's already uploaded on
my channel you can just go and look at
my previous videos to find my skin care
routine but after my face is nice and
clean we're just going to moisturize I'm
using the on dalu probiotics II renewal
cream from Whole Foods I think it has an
orange bottle now but here you guys have
seen that it was green and after that I
decided to not shower today and deal
with the bad hair so we're just brushing
it out adding some Moroccan oil dry
shampoo base Moroccan oil direction -
smells so good I'll obsessed with it so
yeah we're just going to have a bad hair
day if I go outside I'll call the square
beanie but after I finish my hair I'm
going to go ahead to my room and get
dressed so I just heading to my wardrobe
open it up stare my clothes decide what
I'm not going to wear and then I'll open
up my second cabinet down below it's
weird keep most of my shirts that I sold
or t-shirts or just comfy tank tops and
stuff and I usually wear the first thing
I grab today is just a casual and around
the house running errands kinda day so I
just drawn this to see dusty sweatshirt
no sweatshirts a t-shirt from Urban
Outfitters one section and then as you
guys can see here I'm just applying my
makeup no makeup look if that's the same
and then I just throw in some
highlighter and we're going to be adding
a little bit mascara today I like not
putting on very heavy makeup when I'm
running errands around the house and
stuff so after that Ackerman makeup is
finished I'm going to head over my
computer and I basically just check out
other youtubers check out my face aka
Jamie and Brianna love them they also
have a blog channel now you should go
subscribe they're amazing
and also another fade Jeffrey star
he's probably one of my favorite humans
and then after that I just pick out the
jewelry middle-earth today I usually
wear jewelers every single day so all of
these jewels are from ruling class and
my favorite jewellery company ever such
beautiful chokers and they layer so good
together so to show you guys the rest of
my outfit I just enjoy you guys a better
preview of what I'm wearing this
backpack is the light Dreamz ran from
Nasty Gal
I'm wearing car Mar denim black jeans
and my boots are from Shelly's London
they're just these really thick metallic
patent leather boots if that makes sense
and yet you guys can just get a better
look at my outfit and I'm starving don't
you think we should leave to go make
some breakfast downstairs mm-hmm Stella
follows me everywhere I go because we're
best friends like I said earlier so from
breakfast today I do eat normally and
very healthy but we are just going to be
making a simple smoothie today so I'm
just adding raspberries some frozen
mangoes squeeze some lime juice and
lemon juice on there just to give it a
little extra flavor which I love and
then we add some avocado avocado makes
the texture so good and then we're
adding pomegranate juice for flavor so
good add some coconut water it's really
good for your skin add some chia seeds
some Kiwi I love TV and then I also
throw in some ice cubes and I put a
little drizzle of honey on top with that
as well and then I just put it in the
Vitamix blend it up and it comes out
with the perfect consistency I swear
it's the mango with avocado but you guys
can see it's kind of a little bit more
melted than a frozen yogurt you can
totally use this as totally you totally
use this as a SAE Bowl or a fruit bowl
next to that make sense but that is all
I love you guys thank you so much for
watching have a lovely day you made me
crazy
