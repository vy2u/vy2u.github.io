for Christmas 2015 version I am so
excited so this Christmas morning was
different I woke up and I heard all of
my family downstairs in the basement
basement oh my gosh they were in the
kitchen making breakfast which is super
weird because every year our tradition
is we wait at the top of stairs and then
when our parents say we can come down we
come down so it's weird that we were
already down there but I didn't complain
we eat breakfast together and then open
gifts so I'm just excited to share with
you um what I got this year for
Christmas and this should be fun so here
we go I don't know if you guys hadn't
know that I got a new puppy her name is
Stella and she's so cute you say hi

needs to go outside you want to say hi
you must say hi oh
oh hey she looks like a stuffed animal
so crazy she's gonna be about 50 pounds
oh and um she is a goldendoodle
and she's a girl so before we open up
any gifts on Christmas we always do
stockings first so what I got my
stocking this year was a few gift cards
let me pull those so I have a Nordstrom
gift card I don't know if I'm in focus
or not oh man
a Sephora gift card a Trader Joe's gift
card because I go to the University of
Arizona and I like to grocery shop at
Trader Joe's and it's so amazing to get
um grocery store gift cards and then
Starbucks of course and then a Lulu
Lemon infant gift card so yes
and then my dad always puts these um
scratch-offs in our stockings as well
and you can win up to like 25 bucks or
if this one's like 25,000 I don't know
one year I want a dollar
that was pretty cool I also got my
favorite perfume ever which is pink
sugar I don't know if you guys have
heard me talk about pink sugar in my
videos before but I am up stressed with
pink sugar I always have been so it's
good I got an extra one this is found at
like Nordstrom Rack and Ulta and then
the bottle just looks like this it's
just really pretty and clean this is the
last thing I got my stocking it's this
original mineral no-knock detangler this
is the best hair Tingler ever used my
mom has like the huge version of this
and I'm like will you please give me a
big one before I go back to college
because this is the best it's angular
I've ever used and it has a really great
scent it's like super subtle all right
and then I got a pair of socks I have
some adidas on this side and then Puma
socks on this side green and pink and
then these are grey and green and then I
got this super cool light-up
sign to put
room I could not be more excited about
this it's this battery-operated LED
Marquette's marquee sign you should just
open it now I wish I could just bring
this back to my dorms okay so we put
batteries in here and then it lights up
so cute and then um my mom got me this
super pretty
j.crew necklace it's just like kind of
turquoise if that's the right color and
it just sits nicely on the neck I think
and then in this I got an ornament and
it's so so cute I can't wait to put on
my tree it just has the letter K on it
and I'm in love with that I don't know
where it's from otherwise guys I would
tell you but I don't know where it's
from and then my dad got me these super
cool so I've been wanting to buy myself
beats but they've just I haven't done it
I do want to do it so I'm so happy I got
these they're from the brand live and
they're wireless headphones and I've
already tested them out and they're
actually really really good
so I'm obsessed with these my oldest
sister Hannah got me this adorable like
leather suede

shoulder pads and I'll try and print it
off for you guys so this is what it
looks like it's just super cute

is cool hook goes like that and then my
little sister got me this adorable light
pink purse I love the structure of it

Saks off it but it's Rebecca Minkoff
