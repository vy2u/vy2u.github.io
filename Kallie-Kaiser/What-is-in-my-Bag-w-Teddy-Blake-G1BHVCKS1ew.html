to be doing a what is in my purse or
what was in my back video this is
actually a highly requested video on my
channel and I've just never gotten
around to make it for you guys so I'm
really excited that I filmed it and here
it is so here's the bag I've been using
for the past two to three weeks it is
from tiny blank New York it is just one
of the most beautiful bags I am obsessed
with it I really like I'm classy modern
looks um oh do you guys hear my words
right now I have two parakeets they're
so loud okay so um I love this bag I
just have been using it recently because
I hear it's the best size I'd love to
carry my camera around with me even when
I'm back in college in Tucson because
I'm I got a bunch of friends or
something I want to always carry around
my camera bag but I'm always taking
photos for Instagram
so visit purse is amazing it lets me
carry on my camera without my camera bag
I probably should get a more versatile
camera bag but as of right now I just
put my camera in here which is really
nice I haven't added they actually put
my phone in here for this video so I
could feel like I keep my phone on my
purse um but this bag is from take like
New York they actually have a cyber
monday sale I will be uploading this
video on Cyber Monday they have 30
percent off their entire site which is
so nice this bag is originally 378 and I
believe is not 2 or 389 I think it's 270
or 270 something or even lower
amazing amazing deals they have free
returns and exchanges as well so this
bag is so nice I'm obsessed with it it
has like a 5 inch drop in the actual
handle so you could wear this on your
shoulder or as a shopping bag type deal
as a crossbody or just like throw it on
your shoulder like this when I was in
this city I award as a crossbody and it
was perfect it's a perfect all day bag
because it fits so much stuff leather of
this bag is kashkin Bota leather leather
and
and it is made in Italy all their bags
are made in Italy so nice the hardware
on this bag is silvertone steel which is
really nice I love the way it looks and
then it has just two huge compartments
on the side and then one nice zipper
pocket in the middle which is really
really nice and then it also has a side
zipper against the actual bag like near
the lining and then there's just two
like phone-sized pocket in the lining as
well and then this lining is real
leather suede which is really nice like
if I stick my hand in here and feel
around it really nice I personally think
this is a really high-quality bag I've
been using it for the past three weeks
just even bringing it to college and
class with me and just all over shopping
and setting it down there's even
hardware on the bottom so the bag never
really even touches the actual floor
because the metal on the bottom doesn't
allow it to I also added this cute
finish to the backpack to show you guys
when I want to I don't I know what is in
here but not everything because I've
been using it for the past three weeks
okay but first thing I apply on my back
I'm actually leaving for the airport in
two hours so I have this in my bag
because this will haunt me to get to my
dorm is my cat card for University of
Arizona yes I actually do wait around my
neck at school I am so ashamed I'm
honestly so ashamed of it it's fine and
then in the middle compartment here's my
phone this case is from a ritzy it's a
bit weird oh okay and then I have a pack
of gum this is the orbit peppermint um I
have about like a half a pack left so
I'll definitely using that on the
airplane tonight and then oh I just
pulled out two things okay
this hand lotion gets me through winter
I have really dry skin general so my
hands get super dry and cracked and
possibly complete in the wintertime so
this handler
is amazing because on the top it has
chapstick with a cute little mirror and
then it's like do old cap and then this
side smells like almonds it's Portuguese
hand lotion almond pie nutrient rich
hand cream so amazing and it smells
unreal yes I just a lot of this all over
my hands in the wintertime and it takes
away all the dryness and then this is my
all-time favorite raps ever it's from
Sephora
it smells like shea butter and it looks
like lipstick when you put it on I think
it's so cute
and then the packaging is just so bottom
I'm so into it and then I also have okay
more chapstick this is just this is
smells so minty it's just that you know
Smith balm balls
I've had this forever probably like six
and honestly I need to get a new one um
oh I have sleep over the other night so
I took my watch off cuz I don't like to
sleep in it but this is just my Daniel
Wellington watch I like how it's kind of
a good like those mom dad looking
watches super class really cute I posted
on this I posted this on my Instagram
before so if that's why I can't it looks
familiar
oh I was in the city you have to Ln the
city twice over this Thanksgiving break
yeah these gloves are actually two
different sizes because I'm I don't I
don't know
so these were my courage because I
brought them to the city and it's really
cool
oh my gosh oh my gosh okay if anyone has
had these they're amazing different
Trader Joe's it is their organic apple
fruit snax fruit sauce food sauce
crushers they were so good they only
comes in pack the only go in packs of
four which is really depressing because
they are actually the most delicious
thing ever
I'm totally gonna eat this in a second
because I haven't
I usually throw snacks in my purse
because I get hungry usually I have
protein bars though
oh I normally don't keep receipts
I try to be neat oh I went to mushroom
Rock a week ago or two weeks ago and I
got a pair of jeans and pink sugar for
my favorite perfume ever soda okay and
then in the middle of partment
okay I am obsessed with chapstick if you
guys haven't realized that already this
is the accurate dark chocolate quest
mint argan oil lip balm this stuff this
stuff is from Whole Foods and it smells
literally like chocolate and mint it's
so good I love it and it it's pretty
nourishing to the last quite a bit okay
alright other side oh okay so my other
lens is in here because I'm gonna pack
it my suitcase but it's just in here
because I always switch out lenses
because I'm constantly taking Instagram
photos on my camera 24/7 and wherever I
go and this is just my extra lens
because the lens I'm using now is and
zoom in and out so it's nice to have a
lens and zooms in and out for food
photos I guess I really need to look at
new lenses though and try and find
another one oh this is my beanie I
always in the city okay I constantly
Rivini as I'm obsessed with them I think
they're really sick just cozy I guess um
but this one's just black and it's from
Urban Outfitters and then I have gum
wrapper and then of my sunnies these are
my red Ravens they're polarized as well
um I literally wear these in every
Instagram photo I post all the time
they're just the ovals from Ray Bans
there
I love them assess with them I keep them
in here because they get scratched super
easy and you have to protect glasses
okay and then I have oh my i phone cord
and my headphones these are just five
phones I came with my iPhone one side of
them don't even work I really want to
get a pair of beads but I can't do it I
can't do it maybe for Christmas for
myself I Concord we all know what that's
for and then my wallet this is a I got
for Christmas last year this wallet it
was in my what I got for Christmas video
and I think I might do that again but
yeah just traditional wallets in the
middle I have a lot of receives I think
yeah just like a bit of a cash bit cash
and few recedes I have a gift card that
has nothing on it what is this
jo-ann fabric receipt because I'm Anna
so in class at um a and for final
provide final I'm making pajama pants so
that's fun I have this random Polaroid
of my dog but it's such a failed
Polaroid because it's half of his face
