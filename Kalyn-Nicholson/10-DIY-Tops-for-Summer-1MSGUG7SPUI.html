channel for today's video I want to do
with DIY would you guys because it has
been far too long since we have entered
into the realm of DIYs honestly yeah I
have some doing yellow eggs because they
were more like GI wise where I was
trying it for the first time while
filming you for the first time and I
feel like that's going to be like the
ongoing joke like anytime I do DIYs from
here on out this is just a disclaimer
this is me trying it at the same time as
I'm filming it for the sake of it being
searchable on YouTube bull halls of DIY
but for the sake of you know just sand
the fam they're really just ciy so my
summer coming up and also just the fact
that a lot of you guys been requesting
on my Instagram and such like where I
get my panties and all of that fun stuff
I thought it would be a really fun DIY
to do like 10 different ways to cut
sweaters and t-shirts for the spring and
summertime I'm going to be very tumblr
esque and fun and just easy to do and
still in so cute so if you guys want to
know how to cut 10 different shirts and
sweaters for the summertime then just
keep watching
so for this first t-shirt I actually
picked this up from Walmart something
honestly guys it was like nine dollars
and I'm just using this fabric pen to
kind of mark out where I want to crop it
and then right before you kind of cut
out the very edge you just clip
downwards and then you kind of have this
like strip and then you're just going to
want to curve it so that it's easier to
tie and then when you open the t-shirt
back up cut it straight down the middle
and honestly that's all there is to it
it's super easy you just like any type
of logo tee and it just kind of give
this cute crop but with the tie off and
yeah I don't know
nine dollars can't go wrong am i right
but you can have a Nestle so this next
winner might be my favorite one from
this whole DIY I grabbed one of these
crew necks from brandy melville and then
I just marked off where I wanted to crop
it and cut off the bottom and then I
just used this like label as a marker as
to where I wanted to cut the splits down
the sleeve so you could use a ruler for
this or literally just anything but I
just wanted to make sure both sides were
even and then using fabric scissors I
cut the slit and then used the eraser on
the fabric marker to get rid of the
purple line and then I just did the
exact same thing to the other side and I
bought this little harvey davidson label
from brandy melville - and because this
is a no sew tutorial i literally just
used some fabric glue to glue it into
place and this is like a ok to wash it
type of glue so it'll stay on
this next one is again super easy I went
ahead and cut off the label and then
using the fabric marker marked out a
deep Z and then you can make this as
deep as you like and then use some
fabric scissors to cut it off and then
cut around the collar at the top and
then I just use the eraser to erase the
markings and use that okay to wash it
glue to roll up the sleeves and glue
them into place kind of like sewing them
in place it's just so much easier and
that's it honestly this one was so easy
you can crop it too but it's just one of
those cute little things you could do
those roll go to use to make it just a
little bit more fun and if you guys
watched my playlist log you'll know I
picked up this Slytherin sweater and I
really wanted to do something fun with
it so obviously a pretty standard if you
guys just want to crop a sweater I'm
sure you guys know how to but I just
made some markings on both sides and
cropped it but then I thought you know
what let's spice it up just a little bit
more so then I went ahead and cut a slit
up the middle and then tied it off and
make sure to double knot it into place
and that's all you have to do and it
makes us kind of like I don't know why
it reminds me of Kelly from Saved by the
Bell but I don't know I just like the
style of this and it just adds a little
bit more extra and then as for this next
t-shirt I'm going to show you guys how
to do the lace up detailing so again
fabric marker cutting up a slit kind of
like we did for the other t-shirt only
this time I'm using the fabric marker to
mark where I want the lace to be and
then using an exacto knife to just
puncture a little fold be very very
careful because obviously it's super
sharp and then I just use some shoelaces
that you guys could by string whatever
it is you want and then laced up the tee
and knotted it off and I did this to two
different t-shirts you guys could get a
vibe for white in a black one so yeah
again so freaking easy and so like no so
no nothing just yeah
so for this next letter I literally
picked this up from hmm I think it was
like $15 and I'm just using the fabric
marker to cut out little slits in the
sleeves to kind of have like peekaboo
shoulders and arms and then using fabric
scissors I'm going ahead and cutting
that right down on each side so so easy
to do and it just adds a little bit
extra to that you know please list
letter look and also really good for the
summer and then again I just wanted to
add a little bit more to it so I went
down the middle and cut up the sides and
I find that this is a really easy thing
to do to your sweaters if you want them
to be just a little bit more like I find
them more appealing to wear like they're
more flattering so yeah that's all I did
to the sweater and it just added so much
more to such a basic sweater
and I've recently been obsessed with the
look of like ratty logo tees so I took
this Led Zeppelin shirt and I just cut
off the collar on the top and cropped it
down the bottom and you could leave it
just like this but I wanted to add more
to it make it a little bit more like
punk rock you know what I mean
so I took the exacto knife and I'm
literally just cutting holes and like
stretching it out and just again be
super careful because it is really sharp
but just keep doing this until it's
about as distressed as you want it to
look and I find that this looks really
really cute like leggings or ripped up
jeans it just gives you that like I've
got holes all over my shirt and in my
heart kind of look
and one of the easiest DIYs you could do
to a sweater is cut out slits in the
elbows I don't know why this is trend
but I just find it super cute
grandparents and parents are probably
like why are there slipping your elbows
but because style okay so easy to do and
it just adds a little extra to your
sweater you know and the next I'm going
to show you guys how I cut up this
Justin Bieber shirt because we cannot do
a DIY without some Justin Bieber in it I
mean we can but I'm just taking some
fabric marker and marking off the V in
the front like we did before but then
I'm also cutting out the shoulders to
just add a little extra and then I'm
going to use the exacto knife again to
create that kind of ripped up and fold
distressed shirt so I'm doing that all
over just making sure to be careful not
to cut any holes like where your lady
parts are because that just wouldn't do
us any good at all and because this is a
longer one I cut up a slit in the middle
too so that I could tie it off so you
can tighten it like a dress or roll it
up into a t-shirt so you'll see what I
did here I just nodded it off and then
once you put it on you can tighten it
and adjust the size or like the length
of it or you can tie it tight and roll
it up into a t-shirt
just pay and then as for my last sweater
if you guys remember this maximum code
I'll leave a link to it down below but
it was part of my merch come Christmas
time and I'm just taking the top and
cutting off the shoulders again and then
at the bottom instead of just doing a
normal crop I kind of want to do like an
angled crop and just see how that works
out and I ended up loving it so I took
the scissors and just cut up on an angle
and there you have it honestly just two
cuts and it just completely changed the
sweater you can wear it off the shoulder
off both shoulders and I don't know just
really cute and perfect for lounging
around the house so that is it for my 10
easy DIY no-sew tops for the spring and
summer let me know which one was your
favorite down below and if you guys
decide to try any of them out tweet and
Instagram or not maybe because I would
love love love see them and if you guys

want to stay forever
