like a massive storm going on right now
I wanted to do a little 10:00 p.m.
challenge with you guys as you probably
already know from the title this week I
need to get a good amount of sleep it is
like it's just one of those things where
I haven't been doing a good job at it
lately so for the next week and maybe
giving myself one night off every night
this week I'm gonna challenge myself to
try and go to bed at 10:00 p.m. and I'm
starting it tonight getting enough sleep
is important and I haven't been doing it
lately I've been having the most
terrible sleeps the most terrible dreams
like really messed up nightmares and
things like that and I've also just been
running on complete empty like my tank
is so empty I'm going to bed so late
waking up so early to try and get work
done and it's just it's not working for
me I need to get a better amount of
sleep so this week I'm challenging
myself to go to sleep every single night
at 10:00 p.m. but the 10 p.m. challenge
commits
[Laughter]
you see me
I feel like lifting my like I don't know
what's going on right now they're nice
questions so it is actually currently
Thursday August 31st I can't believe
that it is the last day of August below
is my freaking mind by the time you guys
have seen this will already have been a
week into September
how about to head to the grocery store
Greg and I put a bet on I don't know if
you guys watched the MacGregor and
Mayweather fight but Greg and I put a
bet on it and I lost the bet but I
decided to go for the underdog and vote
for you know Conor McGregor and I lost I
lost I would have to make Greg dinner
tonight so that's currently what I'm
about to be doing although I'm running
very behind I had to get all the photos
done for codes because COEs is launching
tonight super exciting I'll link it down
below if you guys haven't seen it yet
he's found his cozy spot oh my god you
having a good time sleeping in there no
further ado I'm gonna stop boring you
guys since I'm sure there's gonna be
multiple verbal updates through this
vlog get some groceries and make some
dinner as I just had a coffee so I'm
super hyper okay let's go
so I hope I mentioned this but Greg
started his company a year ago I'm
pretty sure he said today and he wanted
me to make him cookies today but as you
guys know I had a crazy hectic day so I
didn't have any time to do it we're
gonna trick him I bought some cookies
I'm gonna put them on a platter and make
it look like I baked them right happy
one-year and it'll just be our little
secret he won't he won't have to know
that I didn't bake them I'm even gonna
put them on a pan and warm them up in
the oven so the whole place smells like
cookies or being extra sneaky right now
anyway let's continue cooking this
lavish meal
consensus don't you see your reaction to
and cookie we're getting a sum of
approval
Craig still sleeping so I'm trying to be
quiet like the first day in months that
he's getting to sleep in so he's made a
special request for me to try not to
wake him up this morning I just can't
sleep in I can't do it it's like
impossible it's like everything I'm
doing
finally awake I was talking about how I
was trying to be quiet this morning
so I didn't wake you but my coffee
machine kept making noises and the dog
kept lurking no not not Bentley the dog
likes it working at Burger King
cut my finger if you guys are wondering
cut both fingers now it doesn't matter
how little they are they hurt okay
they're like paper cut cuts but with
glass which is even worse very big
surprise surprise I don't have a read so
anyway here okay well I'm excited either
way I don't care where we go
blood mr. Matt I have a video from like
three years ago good so it is now 5:19
I'm about to head out and walk back to
the place I got my lashes done in last
week's vlog if you guys remember and if
I'm being a hundred percent honest while
I still like there obviously still there
they definitely like a lot of them have
fallen out this one has way less than
this one since Greg and I are going for
like a super nice dinner tonight and
just the stuff that I have planned this
week I was like I want them filled again
even though it's only been six days I'm
gonna go it's only $40.00 to refill them
even though I followed all the
directions like I said I'm gonna keep
you guys posted oh no how this is going
this round doesn't last me at least two
weeks then I think I wouldn't be done
with this is it ridiculously expensive
if I'm gonna have to keep getting them
done like once a week but I'm willing to
give it another chance so I'm gonna run
there get that done and then Greg and I
are heading out our dinner is not until
9:00 so I've got lots of time my
appointments at 6:00 and I'm gonna come
back here and get ready I wanted to
workout today but I ran out of time
we're going to like the Drake Hotel here
in Toronto for dinner time to go throw
on some headphones and make the journey
so mellow it's been a while since I've
updated you guys I didn't end up showing
you my after so I'll put the before and
after and but this girl did an
incredible job so I think I want to
start going back to her her name was
Vivian it was at list for lashes she was
the bomb so Greg's visually here and
we're super late for our reservation
tonight if you guys are curious as to
what I'm wearing this black t-shirt
dress that I've had literally forever if
you guys remember it and then
but you guys wouldn't have seen yet from
Lola Shoetique it's in an upcoming you
tober video but there's like cute little
thigh high boots I might throw a jacket
on
that's the attire for the night surprise
you put a surprise my reader is there
actually a surprise my freezer second
joy because you just launched you start
is this for coats yeah
that's so cute so we're gonna pop
champagne and eat ice cream later let's
go be great naughty getting a little
hungry they have sushi did you know that
no so excited come me come people what
else could you possibly be doing Oh
join me no thanks
your shoes match your jacket good
morning well actually good afternoon and
happy Sunday it is currently Sunday
September is it the third already oh my
god it is actually the third earlier in
this vlog I told you guys how I went to
go get my lashes completely redone well
last night I rubbed the crap out of this
eye so now this eye has no lashes
general conclusion I think I'm done with
false lashes I know that it only lasted
one week but literally this is insanity
I woke up of lashes all over my badge
don't they
cut out for too expensive and obviously
I just like I can't I can't control what
I do in my sleep that's just it
very short-lived attempt at false lashes
today I'm actually getting all the
orders ready for COEs to ship them out
tomorrow morning so I just poured myself
a good old cup of the good stuff in my
coffee choc mug which is still available
on codes it's one of the few things that
didn't sell out I just like I'm gonna
use this mug and all of my coffee talks
now I'm the one that's actually
physically stripping them out and for
the first 50 orders I'm writing a little
thank-you gonna take me probably a few
hours but I will time-lapse the crap out
of it let's do that so it's now Monday I
just realized that I didn't film an
outro to this vlog and it's like the end
of the day on Monday but anyway did you
a love it to the point I ended up
finishing about half the orders for
coasts I'm going to finish the rest of
them hopefully tonight it's actually
getting pretty late in the day it's
close to 6:00 p.m.
gonna be my sixth night of going to
sleep at 10 p.m. the only night that I
didn't go to bed this week at 10 p.m.
was the night that Greg was over you
guys saw that I cooked dinner on
Thursday I mean mind you we were like
falling in and out of sleep that night
while watching Game of Thrones but I had
to stay up because COEs launched that
night so I did stay up till midnight
that night but it is going to be the 6th
night tonight of staying up and then
tomorrow will be the last day I just
wanted to update you guys on how it's
been going and if I've noticed any
difference I mean it hasn't been a full
week yet one thing I have noticed is one
I haven't had as many of bad dreams that
is the first thing I noticed I was
having like it was a good thing to the
last month that I started having really
vivid not even bad dreams but they were
just so vivid everything felt so real
and it was like so like really emotional
dreams of anything the second thing I
noticed is that I'm a lot more
well-rested and productive during the
days so that is definitely the first
thing that I've noticed was going to bed
at 10:00 p.m. I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to stick to it that's the only
problem because it was a struggle felt
like going to bed at 10:00 I wasn't
finishing work to like 9:00 9:30 so I
didn't really feel like I had much
time this week with going to sleep so
early to relax so I might push it to 11
p.m. as always since these logs are
weekly I'm gonna keep you guys posted
one last quick note as well I wanted to
let you guys know that I've officially
started theming my weeks of videos
youtuber excluded but considering
Sunday's like the first video in the
actual work week on Sunday vlogs I'm
gonna let you guys in on what the theme
of the week is so this week is all about
so you can say like adulting so that is
the theme behind this week's videos and
there's like a tour video and there's
also a how-to videos so those are my
little hints for you guys for this
week's videos if you guys decide to do
the 10:00 p.m. challenge definitely let
me know tweet me or whatever let me know
how it goes tell me your progress
throughout it I'm challenging you guys
to do it for a whole week go to bed at
10:00 p.m. and see if it makes a
difference and other than that I love
you guys to them in the back I hope you
guys enjoyed hanging out with me today
it well I know that I'll see you guys
all on Tuesday good thing I'm done
vlogging bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
