we all needed you I just can't even
there's no I can't even form words hey I
was doing just fine before I met you I
drink too much and absently hey guys and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I am doing a 16 things that I
learned in 2016 and I wrote down the 16
things I learned this year is probably a
lot more things that I learned this year
that aren't on here all in all I feel
like 2016 was a very transitional year
like there's just no better way to put
it it really isn't it was one of the
hardest years and the best years that
I've had this far in my young 22 years
let me share with you the 16 things that
it taught me that's the number one one
of the biggest things I think I learned
this year is that a negative mind will
never give you a positive life and that
is something that I always used to
preach but I feel like I've finally
understood it this year because I've
gone through so many different mindsets
in 2016 most specifically in the fall I
would say is when I had like this huge
negative like I was in a really dark
place and I was in like having just a
massive pity party for myself and I
couldn't figure out why I couldn't get
out of it most of the time I can get
myself out of slumps and I just kept
like waiting to feel better and waiting
to get out of this rut and I didn't
realize that I was keeping myself in
that rut by staying in that negative
lacking like super pessimistic mindset
and waiting to just feel better and that
just doesn't happen like you can't feel
better without thinking better and so
you have to clear out the junk that's in
your head and you have to think positive
if you want to attract positive 2016 it
like really came full circle for me
where I fully understood that like if
you want to live better you have to
think better
the second thing 2016 taught me is to
take your goddamn time like why was I
always in such a rush when I seem to
feel like I have a lot of things to do
and I'm overwhelmed I get anxious and I
try and speed through everything just
slow down and take your time even if it
ends up being that you can't get
everything done the day you want to get
it done take
time and do things right so that you
don't have to go back and waste more
time later having to redo it all like I
don't know why it was such a thing for
me this year to just try and speed
through everything to try and race
through everything like just slow down
you got time the third thing I learned
in 2016 is that things are never as bad
as they seem
ever ever ever ever no matter how bad
you like work things up to be in your
head it's never ever as bad as you think
it's going to be just stop that whole
you know hamster wheel thing going on in
your head that makes you think the world
is ending all the time
the world is not ending the Sun will
still come up tomorrow everything will
go on and in a few weeks whatever it is
you're freaking out about isn't going to
be relevant to you anymore it's not as
bad as it seems the fourth thing I
learned in 2016 is when in doubt wear
black actually the fifth thing I learned
in 2016 is just just always wear black
just just always always just black
clothes are always the answer to
everything the sixth thing that I
learned in 2016 is to have a friend you
need to be a friend and this was like
mind-blowing
earth-shattering moment when I realized
this this year if you want friends to be
around then you have to go out and be
around them you have to reach out you
have to make plans to don't just leave
it to everybody else to have a friend
you need to be a friend which leads me
to the seventh thing that I felt I
really learned in 2016 and that is if
you want something go get it stop
waiting around kind of like the if you
want a friend be a friend don't wait
around for your friends don't just wait
around for the things you want either if
you want something stop talking about it
and just go out and do what you have to
do to make it happen and it's more so
something that I've learned towards the
end of 2016 but it's kind of the motto
that I'm going into 2017 with where it's
like I want to stop talking the talk and
start walking the walk I don't want to
just talk about doing things I want to
go out and do them and I want to go and
make them happen don't wait around for
things to happen for you go out there
and do them for yourself the eighth
thing I would say I learned 2016 the
right attention from the wrong guy at a
lonely time can be very varied to see
then that thing I learned in 2016 is not
everybody is going to like you and odds
are a lot of people aren't going to like
you so when it boils down to it make
sure you like you because if you waste
your time trying to make everybody else
like you you're going to a have a huge
identity crisis because you're gonna
lose yourself and B you're not going to
be happy at the end of the day because
you're trying to keep everybody else
happy so even if people don't like you
as long as you like who you are at the
end of the day and you feel like you've
been a good person at the end of the day
that's all you can do the 10 thing that
2016 taught me is say yes jump on
opportunity when opportunity comes
knocking never say no even if you don't
really feel like it because honestly
everything happens for a reason
opportunities are put in front of us for
a reason and go out there and just say
yes and jump on opportunity the 11th
thing I learned a lot in 2016 and I'm
really really lucky and grateful to be
able to have learned this and that is to
travel because it gives you a fresh
perspective and also there's a hair in
my eyeball enriches your soul it makes
you feel so much more you just see more
you meet more people you're around
different cultures you're around
different you know settings you've seen
different things you're out there living
your life to the fullest so just travel
every time and as much as you can the
twelfth thing that I learned in 2016 is
to choose love because hate is far far
too heavy to carry around
you can choose to love or you can choose
to hate one of them is a hell of a lot
heavier than the other the 13th thing I
learned in 2016 is that you are what you
think this kind of ties into the first
one I said your perspective is your
reality the way you perceive everything
around you is the reality you're
creating for yourself so if you think
certain things about yourself then
self-fulfilling prophecy you will be
those things make sure that your mind is
happy and positive and that you're
thinking good things about yourself
because you are what you think the 14th
thing I learned in 2016 is never be
afraid to lose what needs to get lost
that kind of sounds harsh but I just
mean whether it be bad friends bad
energy bad habit
don't be afraid to let those things go
they have no place in your life and so
if you are afraid to let those things go
because they've become a security thing
for you or like a comfort thing for you
never be afraid to lose what needs to
get lost the 15th thing that I learned
in 2016 is when something bad happens to
you you have two choices you can let it
defeat you or you can defeat it you can
sit around and let life stamp all over
you and defeat you and you consider out
and have a pity party about it
which I did multiple times in 2016 or
you can stand up and you can defeat it
you can make something come out of it
you can learn a lesson from it honestly
self-doubt and shame and making yourself
feel like crap about bad things going on
in your life it just doesn't do anyone
any good it's some big giant waste of
time nobody's life is sunshine and
daisies I'm not gonna let you get me
down and the last and final 16th thing
that I learned in 2016 is to spend more
time on what gives you energy and less
time on what takes it away this is
something that we tend to forget we have
a choice in and I think I just spent way
way too much time in 2016 on things that
ended up just making me feel worse and
then not only that when they make us
feel worse we emit that bad energy and
then we start to spread that so be
proactive in that decision and don't
just sit around and just let life you
know happen and react to it be proactive
choose spend time on things that give
you energy so that sums up the 16 things
that I learned in 2016 I'm sure there's
a ton more as hard as 2016 was it was
also one of the best years of my life I
did some of the most incredible things
this year 2016 was the first year I've
spent in a long long time just being
single on my own and not only that
living in my first apartment by myself
how to be myself and be by myself and I
think that's the most important thing
that I completely didn't even put on
that list so I want to know what you
guys learned in 2016 be sure to leave
anything you learned or 16 things you
learned down below so that you
and share what 2016 taught you I hope
you guys are excited for 2017 I am like
I can't even I can't I can't even
describe to you guys how excited I am
for the new year 2016 needed to happen
because it does set us all up to have an
amazing year next year so I hope you
