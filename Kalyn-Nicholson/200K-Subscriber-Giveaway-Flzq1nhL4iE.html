out a little bit late but I have finally
collected all the things that I wanted
to put into this video so I am
apologizing for it being a little bit
past due but i'm today i'm going to be
putting up my 200,000 subscriber
giveaway and sharing with you guys what
it is that the winning prize is and how
to enter and all of that fun stuff but
first i would just really really like to
thank you guys so so much for
subscribing and supporting me in my
channel i literally started technically
like a year ago around this time a year
ago and so for it to have grown so
quickly for me it's just it's just so
mind-boggling because i would still be
doing this even if five of you guys
we're just watching this and i had like
five subscribers i would still be doing
this for you guys because it's truly
just what i'd love to do and i love
being able to interact with all of you
guys each and every single day and you
guys have just completely changed my
life and i owe so much to you guys and i
love you guys so much and i just want to
be able to give back to you guys so
another milestone i hit on my channel so
it's in time for another giveaway and i
actually got the idea from this giveaway
on my instagram someone posted saying
you should do a giveaway of some of your
favorite things so for this giveaway i
kind of themed it around some of my
favorite things in the world and just
stuff that I can't live without so I'm
basically just going to show you guys
the stuff that I got and the giveaway
and how to enter and if you don't win
this one just remember that there are
gonna be lots of other giveaways so just
I guess keep entering all of them every
single one so for this giveaway it is
completely themed around some of the
things that I couldn't live without or
some of my all-time favorite things so
I'm just going to indulge into what the
giveaway is and show you guys so I'm
going to keep the coolest thing last and
I'll start with all the little
knickknacks first so if you guys didn't
already notice I have a pair of
sunglasses on my head cuz I was just
outside and I was driving around and
stuff so I have my sunglasses on and
then yeah so I actually recently got
these sunglasses and a lot of you guys
in my Instagram I'm actually asking me
where I got them and I did get them from
urban planet but I actually got a second
pair they are exactly the same
I got a second pair for the giveaway so
for whoever wins this giveaway we will
have matching little cat eyes sunglasses
that looks weird but we will have little
matching cat eye sunglasses and I picked
these up for that person or the winner
next if you guys don't already know I'm
obsessed with bows I actually made a
boat collection video and showed you
guys some hairstyles you can wear with
bows so I couldn't do my favourite
giveaway without putting in one of one
of these bows so it's actually not
showing up on camera but it is like a
neon orange coral color it looks just
playing orange on camera but it is like
a neon bright corally orange so that is
the bow that you'll be getting and it is
a hair clip bow so you're gonna clip it
right into your hair or we're however
you would like to wear it so obviously
you guys also know that I am obsessed is
makeup I have a pretty decent collection
of makeup and I just I love makeup like
so much so I decided to pick you up two
little makeup items they are both from
hard candy because hard candy does not
test on animals so I just wanted to kind
of go out of my way to try and get you
guys something cruelty free so the first
thing I got you guys is this lip balm
it's like a lip color balm and it's in
the color cupcake so it's this really
pretty baby pink perfect for the
springtime and I just think it's super
pretty so you'll be getting this it's
called all glossed up hydrating lip
stain sorry so that's what this is and
you'll also be getting in ink black a
lash ink lash stain it is a mascara but
it also stains your lashes black for up
to four days to make up items I couldn't
live without if I had to choose to it
would be a lip balm or a lip stain and a
mascara so I've threw those into the
giveaway so the next three things kind
of go together and this is all one big
giveaway by the way guys like these are
all going into one prize so whoever wins
this is going to win all of this so if
you guys don't already know I'm obsessed
with coffee journaling and reading so
those are three things that I probably
do I would say almost every single day
so what I got you guys is a a journal
it's a brand new journal it's actually
it was in one of my recent DIYs so you
guys can DIY this one yourself and I
have the exact same one except I put
pictures all over the front of mine and
it's just a journal for you guys to
journal in if you aren't a journal or
you can use this for school
or whatever else you guys want to use it
for but I highly recommend doing it as a
journal so I got the winner a brand new
journal and next I also got the person a
new book I am obsessed with books and
for summer considering it is May going
into summer time I decided to get you a
Sarah Dessen book because they are
perfect for the summertime they're great
summer reads so this one is called that
summer and it is a really really good
book and it's a smaller one so it's
really really quick to read if you're
not a big reader you can still get into
it for the summertime it'll be a fast
read and also it'll be good for any kind
of age level that wins this giveaway
will be able to read this so I really
really enjoyed this book I have a couple
other Sarah Dessen books too so we will
have matching books and this is a really
really good one so even if you don't win
I highly recommend you go check out this
book next obviously guys I'm obsessed
with coffee I'm obsessed with just
Starbucks in general so I had to get you
guys a Starbucks gift card so you will
be getting a $15 Starbucks gift card as
well so the next thing that I have is
just this cute little tote it actually
is very very close to the most same one
as me but um it's not exactly the same
but it looks the same so it's just this
little satchel thing you can put it
obviously like this over your shoulder
or just wear it over one arm and it's
really pretty black checkered and it's
like a fake leather and then you can
just open it up and it'll fit like your
phone your wallet or anything that you
have to bring with you so last but not
least here's the biggest part of this
giveaway and like I mentioned all before
all of these prizes are one giveaway so
the biggest part of the giveaway and it
is one of my new all-time favorite
things in the world and a lot of you
guys have been asking questions about it
is you will be getting any future film
Instax
Instax Mini 8 instant camera so I
actually got this for LA if you guys saw
it in my packing my suitcase video you
guys will notice that I have one of
these little Polaroid cameras yes it is
a Polaroid camera so it comes with two
rolls or two things of comes of two
things of film so the pictures will
print out automatically and I got you
guys white because I didn't know what
color you guys would wanted mine is
white and I'm obsessed with it because
it matches everything so
basically it is just one of these
cameras you put the film in you take a
picture it prints out right away and if
you guys haven't seen these they're on
like we heart it they've been all over
the place and then that's how I found it
and you can get them from Best Buy
Walmart staples there's so many
different places you can get it but the
winner of this giveaway will be getting
one of their very own and it's the exact
same color as mine so those are all the
things for the giveaway if you notice
they kind of had a little bit of a theme
to them all being my favorite things I
can't live without my camera I can't
live without my little purse or satchel
can't live without Starbucks can't live
without reading can't live without
journaling can't live without makeup and
can't live without bows so I decided to
kind of put all those things together
into a really fun giveaway for you guys
