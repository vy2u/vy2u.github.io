spilling you don't anything to task so
many books - me hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I am doing a bit of like a book
haul mixed with books slash self-help
slash motivational books that I'm hoping
and praying might change my life this
year I was thinking of some ideas for my
channel at the beginning of this year
and one of the ideas that I had was to
do at least one book related video every
single month so we could do like
mysteries thrillers love stories summer
books all of that fun stuff for January
of course what better
sharra to kind of go into them like
motivational self-help change your life
book bucket list for 2018 basically what
I'm trying to do this year is read one
fiction of one non-fiction book every
single month the Harry Potter book that
I'm reading it's the order of the
Phoenix so it's super long it's taking
me a little longer than I thought to get
through which is why I've already ripped
through two of my self-help / nonfiction
books but being ahead of schedule one
being that there's only seven books and
twelve months in the year there's
probably gonna be more that I pick up
throughout the year but these are the
ones that I'm starting with I have them
in order of how I'm gonna read them and
so that's just gonna be how we go
through them and if you guys have any
recommendations for me to add to this
list obviously I need to pick up a few
more so definitely let me know also if
you guys aren't following me already be
sure to check out my Twitter and my
Instagram I usually tweet out what I'm
currently reading saying that now I just
realize haven't done that yet I'm gonna
do that today but I usually tweet out
books that I'm currently reading so if
you guys want to stay more on top of it
definitely go check that out and other
than that if you guys want to know the
book haul that I recently did as well as
all of the books that are gonna change
your life in 2018 or at least my life in
2018 then just keep watching
so the first books that I read in 2018 I
actually read it just over like New
Year's and Christmas break finished it
the first week of January it is big
magic by elizabeth gilbert and this book
is one of those things funny enough if
you guys watch any of my ears like
videos which were
pretty recent felt like this
overwhelming motto for 2018 was gonna be
magic and that was before I started
reading this says obviously big magic
says the name of the book suddenly I was
like it just kind of clicked you know
what I'm gonna give it a go and it was
the best decision I've ever made it set
the whole year off on such a good foot
it's all about releasing your creative
energy and living beyond the fear that
kind of keeps us confined to playing it
safe and not going for things and not
really like playing with life if that
makes sense it helps you go to break
free of the chains inside your mind that
tell you that you have to wake up do
this do that and that you can't be
creative that you can't have fun and
that means even doing things that you
necessarily don't want to do like for
instance when I have to answer emails
that doesn't make me feel creative but I
can do it in a creative way or I can
make a cool signature at the bottom of
the email I can put on like a really
cute I don't know the email answering
outfit just something that's going to
make it have more of a positive energy
in a positive experience it also goes
through how ideas work and how we grab
on to them and we manifest them and
create them into the physical realm and
how we pull them from the non-physical
realm
even just things like if it's not right
for you or if you don't take it
seriously enough like your ideas will go
knock on someone else's door it's a lot
about just like creative freedom and
having a lot more fun with life and
creating a life that feels fun to you
without feeling like you need to like
run away or quit your daytime job but
you pick up any book actually there's so
many good ones but if you pick up any
book in this book called
let it be big magic because honestly
this was the best start to my year and
I'm a hundred second I read this book
again before the years up what I've been
doing lately every time I read a
nonfiction book I make a note in my
phone and anything that jumps out to me
anything that I want to remember for the
book I put in point for him but I only
started doing that after this book so I
want to reread it again and create a big
magic note and if you guys want I can
post my book notes to my blog if you
guys ever want me to post they're almost
like book summaries and important things
that I pulled from the book so if you
guys ever want me to post that on my
blog I can't so the second book that I
read and finished already this year is
called the witch and it's by Lisa Lister
if you follow me on Goodreads you'll
already know my review of this book
basically it was very far out for
what I'm used to it was very outside of
my usual comfort zone when it comes to
reading which i think is really cool
because I've learned a lot about things
that I didn't even know about at all
just a lot of likes the spiritual
illness behind witchcraft and there are
some really cool things that I pulled
from this book in this book also kind of
helps me realize that I really want to
start studying more the phases of the
Moon actually okay guys we're all we're
all friends here so I'm gonna be honest
with you guys you ever better figure out
how lame I truly am okay Greg chirps me
all the time because I'm convinced that
I might be a little bit psychic go for
like a good chunk of my life I wanted to
be Rachel from friends then I realized I
was Monica and now it's suddenly hitting
me that I'm truly just Phoebe there has
been times where I have visions or I
have these overwhelming symbols come up
inside my mind and then it happens or it
leads me to something and I'm like oh my
god I'm psychic and so when I meditate
and stuff these visions come through to
me a lot and I actually truly I I I kind
of believe in them I'm not gonna lie
it's one of the visions that I've had
multiple times now is I see like my
Higher Self it's the part of you that is
one with like the universe so I see us I
see me I guess but the cool thing is is
that that version of me has tattoos that
Idol pavia and that version of me
doesn't talk but shows me symbols anyway
backtracking
we can talk about this later one of the
symbols that I've seen multiple times
and ended up seeing the tattoo on myself
it was a waning crescent moon I hope I
said waiting right I don't know how to
say I was researching last night and so
bring it back sorry
that's actually awaiting crescent moon
right there that's what it looked like
she talks a lot in this book about the
phases of the Moon and that part I found
really cool she also talks a lot about
essential oils and those types of things
and a lot of the more like nature and
the elements and that part of this book
was really really cool I found that
super interesting but the more heavily
witch stuff in this book
how do I say it it was interesting to
learn about feel like an openness to it
you know like naturally I wasn't like
yes this is stuff I want to try I was
like that's really cool and interesting
and I feel like I put more of like The
Four Agreements
type of spirituality and yoga and
meditation but I still thought that this
was a wicked cool book to read and that
had some really cool stuff I never
learned about a tea show you might love
it the next book I have to show you guys
is actually the one that I'm reading
right now I started reading it in Hawaii
and it is light is the new black by
Rebecca Campbell this is what it looks
like it totally matches my outfit today
it's a guide to answering your souls
callings and work in your light the one
thing that I really really like about
this book I have a lot of page pages
like bunny eared you where someone that
finds you don't have a lot of time to
read I would definitely go with this
book in this collection solely for the
fact that every page is almost like a
little tiny mini chapter they're all
maybe one to two pages long and they're
almost like little journal entries that
she's written before and it's also
really cool because it's all about
following your light with meditation and
stuff another thing I picture a lot is
light whenever I'm feeling anxious like
when I was on the plane the other day I
started getting a little anxious and
I'll like close my eyes and physically
picture a ball of light just like
circling around the area that I'm in so
I like circled the plane in my mind with
this light and it suddenly just felt a
lot more protected I'm just telling you
guys all the laying things I do inside
my head in this video but I find it
really works and I also stand a lot
behind a lot of things that she talks
about in this book this is a lot more my
kind of spirituality than I would say
which was the cool thing that all of
these books have pick and choose and
take things out of all different types
of mind opening books and almost adapt
them to fit your life and to fit what
feels right for you and so that is
something I really like about this book
just getting into the third quarter of
it I don't have much left to read now
she's going through all of the ways you
can actually incorporate practicing a
lot of thus mindsets and perspective she
talks about into your day to day life
but she's super big into believing about
meditation in her guide and following
that inner guide and in a way
letting that inner guide creator
manifest things for you that bring you
more joy which in turn makes you happier
that's kind of what I've pulled from the
book so far highly recommend it I'm
gonna call this one a nine out of ten
next to big magic Zig magic is just like
it's big magic you know the next book
that I'm going to read after light is
the new black this is one that I also
brought with me to Hawaii but I didn't
get a chance to read it while I was
there it is sacred powers the five
secrets to awakening transformation and
by David G I hope I said his name right
his last name is ji maybe it's David Jai
I'm not sure I got this book the day
that I was picking up stuff for my yoga
room in my how I deal with anxiety vlog
and I was instantly drawn to it like
it's the first thing I picked up if the
author David she looks like he is living
his best life plus I love that he made
his author photo and him and his dog can
we just
he seems like someone I really enjoy a
cup of tea with feel like he would be so
wise of knowing on the back and says
have you ever found yourself at a
crossroads unsure of which way to turn
maybe you reached a fork in the road and
felt overwhelmed by the choices before
you or perhaps you felt stuck held back
by your fear of making the wrong
decision with one foot rooted firmly in
the past and the other dangling into the
unknown but there is a pathway out of
your challenges and into the space of
freedom happiness and lasting
fulfillment sounds good to me
thousands of years divine solutions have
been whispered directly into the hearts
of priests shamans wizards medicine
women and healers in sacred powers
internationally renowned meditation
master love already
David ji reveals the deepest secrets of
this timeless wisdom and distills their
essence into the five divine principles
of the universe and it is the divine
principle of one awareness rebirth
infinite flow and inner fire each step
on this path will unfold eternal truths
to guide you along the lifelong journey
of clarity and connection expansion and
abundance love and happiness courage and
confidence and passion and purpose this
is gonna be a good one I think this is
gonna be really good one flipping
through it there's actual like projects
or practices like questionnaires and
like you fill things out in the book as
you go along and you read I just I'm
really excited I'm like very close to
finishing this book so I'm getting real
pumped you guys want me to update you on
how this was let me know the next book
that I purchased is let the elephants
run by David Asher and it says unlock
your creativity and change
everything really cool thing about this
book is when I purchased it I didn't
know but it was signed by the author so
let the elephant's run is a book that
was suggested after I picked up big
magic apparently this is also a lot
about releasing your creativity living
through your creativity and just having
a lot of fun with life finding
inspiration in all types of places like
even just the inside the very first page
is an elephant with a bunch of written
words now that we've been already
talking about this I've also had a
vision of me with an elephant so I feel
like I feel like I might get to pet an
elephant this year and if I do I will
ball and sob and hysterically little
symbols guys and the book itself it says
dream big what the elephant's run the
words are a reminder for us to hold a
place in our minds for creativity where
big ideas can form and our imagination
can run free we all start our lives as
creative beings but for many that spark
becomes lost over time as Sharon powers
readers to achieve more aha moments
through two cornerstone principles of
creativity freedom and structure it is a
learnable skill that any person or
business can master the dynamic
full-color design includes photographs
artwork and illustrations so that is the
other thing that I really liked about
this book I haven't started reading it
yet obviously it'll be after secret
hours but even just flipping through
this book you'll see that there's a lot
of color and just like this just looks
like it's gonna be really fun to read
and then next on my list is the
untethered soul this book was
recommended to me by so many of you guys
and also just so many people in general
so I decided to finally pick it up by
Michael a singer and it's the journey
beyond yourself the quote of the top
says read this book carefully and you
will get more than a glimpse of eternity
again I love it already the back says
who are you really what would it be like
to be free from limitations and soar
beyond your boundaries what can you do
each day to find this kind of inner
peace and freedom
the untethered soul offers a simple
profoundly intuitive answer to these
questions whether this is your first
exploration of inner space or you've
devoted your life to an Emer journey
this book will transform your
relationship with yourself and the world
around you
the untethered soul begins by walking
you through your relationship with your
thoughts and emotions helping you
uncover the source and fluctuations of
your inner energy it then delves into
what you can do to free yourself from
they have been xual thoughts emotions
and energy patterns that limit your
consciousness finally the perfect
clarity this book opens the door to the
life lived in freedom and your inner
most being wow that sounds amazing I
cannot reach read this book this is
making me so like I want to just rip
through these because I don't I want to
read them all I'll probably be reading
this one comes springtime and I feel
like this is gonna be a life-changing
book I can just sense it and the last
book I have to share with you guys is
one that I just recently picked up when
I was at Urban Outfitters and it's by
Sarah Knight it's called you do you how
to be who you are to use what you've got
and get what you want again I'm like
everything and actually every book here
has a purple or blue or pink hue so the
back of this book says being yourself
should be easy get so many of us
struggle to live on other people's terms
instead of our own rather than feeling
large and in charge we feel a little and
belittled best-selling anti guru Sarah
Knight has three simple words for you
you do you it's time to start putting
your happiness first and stop letting
other people tell you what to do how to
do it or why it can't be done both the
tyranny of just because the social
contract and how to amend it turning
flaws into strengths why it's not your
job to be nice letting your freak flag
fly how to take risks and silence
doubters and prove the haters wrong only
thing and I haven't read it yet so I
can't say but the only thing is I love
letting your freak flag fly because
lately I've been really letting my freak
flag fly but when she says why is not
your job to be nice and how to prove the
haters wrong I think with just the other
books I've been reading and just in
general I've been doing a lot of
research into like Buddhism and
meditation and one of the biggest things
that I've learned lately and I've been
putting into practice a lot lately and
it's been making a big change on my
mindset kind of catering to other people
before catering to yourself and for
instance being nice to somebody despite
whether they're nice to you kill them
with kindness only just because it
spreads more light that way on someone
that could just be having a bad day
rather than retracting more darkness
towards yourself and proving haters
wrong I'm also just a big believer that
where there's energy there's power and
so if you put your energy into proving
haters wrong you're kind of giving
haters power that said maybe her
perspective on it or her like
explanation of it is actually a way to
twist it and end up being nice or not
caring about your haters at all I won't
know until I read it
we're not pointing the video
we start to get cold which it's totally
fine because that is it those are all of
the books that I had to show you guys
