to my channel this is probably one of
the coolest places I've ever done an
intro yes I'm on a boat also just burned
myself a copy for today's video I am
doing a vlog with you guys this is gonna
be a huge road trip vlog Fenley and I
actually are currently in Charleston
South Carolina we drove here Oh last
night well yesterday I was in my
hometown Kingston for Easter woke up at
like 4:00 in the morning hit the road I
don't need just like regurgitating it
why don't I just show you
how to write it down but I can never win
I can never
you will like it is an see didn't I get
confused
you wanna help trout by myself look
inside the book
minute gonna wait since for ya
kabocha and I'm so tired made it honey
and so now here we are we got up not too
long ago I ended up guys I'm actually
like low-key so embarrassed um I ended
up not going to bed till like 2:00 there
was a really really loud noise last
night and the fact that I was so
sleep-deprived mixed with the fact that
I'm somewhere new mixed with the fact
that Bentley's got a big bark for a five
pound dog but he ain't got no bite so um
I kind of got really freaked out
welcome Craig and texted the people that
owned this Airbnb at like 1 o'clock in
the morning convinced that there was
someone on the boat there was no one on
the boat anyways regardless I went about
it - I'm a little tired today so I'm
gonna have a few of these before we hit
the road I have a general idea of what
we might do today I'm thinking that we
might go to the plantation it's
literally a place full of plants since
we're going to be going to Florida
tomorrow I figured we could save the
beach for Florida so that was my very
long explanation coming you guys to our
little puppy adventure roadtrip like
guys Burnie we're not a frickin yacht
right now so there's like a balcony
patio thing upstairs climb up there read
two chapters of my book do a little bit
of like a morning flow and then honestly
probably change and just go straight to
the plantation that I'm thinking tonight
family and I might go on a little date
I'd like a cute little date outfit we've
spent some quality time with Bentley you
know with all the projects and working
stuff going on aside from our walk I
want Bentley to get out I want my dog to
be you know explored and to have seen
the world so that is why we're doing
this and also because I got a new bike
wanted to bring it to the beach
certainly hooked up to the back of my
Jeep right now that lanes birthday is
next week there's just a lot of factors
that played into our year but the puppy
adventures begin
teen years of Mahlon self-destruct food
swing for that time
show me what this laughs is out
teach me bow
grace
me
don't let me
but I still struggle to know
be singing
No
my way
so tired
at the same time it's only 8 p.m. and
the night is so young I feel like
because I only had one full day in
Charleston even though I feel really
tired I think I might throw my books
into my backpack get back on my bike and
bike out I'm like where I'm staying is
relatively close to like downtown
Charleston Bentley is completely zonked
like he's so tired so I think I'm gonna
throw my books in my bag bike somewhere
see if I can find somewhere to just take
a seat then one kind of chill that you
can go alone take a seat read a little
bit somewhere I can wear leggings in a
sweater because I'm soaked up here right
now there's no way I'm gonna change
that's kind of the plane so far today
was so much fun like that garden guys oh
my god I literally found my heaven
apparently it's one of the oldest
gardens it said in the world but I want
to say probably more so America in
general it was so beautiful I wanted to
buy plants and try and see if I could
bring them home but I felt like they
would die so I didn't buy any but oh my
god and then biking around the houses
here like the pastel colored houses here
the pink the pink Charleston is like I
wish I had more than just one day but
for that reason I'm gonna go and make
the most of the one night that I do have
and then and then go to bed even if I go
to bed at like 10 at least I'll feel
like I did something that I'll leave
pretty early
it's Jeff Florida one hole in the days
you do
but ask me like we in the same place are
we doing it right are we doing it right
everyone
everyone idea what they think is right
but our Joon
are we doing it right
is supportive of this so I ready to
fight
are you ready to fight Cousineau when we
succeed this is a currently stopped in
Georgia and there's this place Atmos gas
station believes everyone has warranties
I hope you know what you gotta do
like
you're now in Florida funny enough a
little bit look an hour later than I
thought we would be slowly because I
took the wrong turn on the Florida
Turnpike actually going on six thirty
it's already pretty late in the day I
think the plan right now is I'm going to
take my bike off the Jeep I grab some
stuff to just make dinner here I've been
like feigning like a good wholesome bowl
of like cooked foods since I have to
edit and I have to answer emails and
just get like some stuff done I kind of
want to put like a hair mask in my hair
take a nice hot shower maybe do some
yoga outside you see that way throughout
there just like a lovely lawn and garden
I really want to get up early tomorrow
morning and maybe go see the Sun Rise
even though the last two days have been
amazing I haven't really been sleeping
all that well that's why we're gonna
keep it low-key tonight so cue the bike
shots and lovely dinner and then I'll
just let it roll into me
live together in the kind of world were
we you know it's gonna make it that much
better
but we can sack
together
wouldn't it be nice if we could wake
around the day after
together hold each other
what happened
I wish that every case
being honest I think every shall be
brave I come true there would be a thing
and then
ba-ba-ba-ba
we talked about it it only makes it
worse
with
Billy tweet through the boat sat on my
window and it's only I don't need to
worry Sam became like cinema so sweet
little girls double dots and a concrete
baby sometimes we've got it wrong but
it's alright the more things seem to
change the more they stay the same
oh don't you hesitate girl put your
records on tell me your favorite song
you go ahead let your hair down sapphire
and faded jeans I hope I need to get an
oil change on my Jeep especially because
I still have a really long drive back
and my jeep is due for an oil change oh
I just call it a place and they are
gonna take me in so I'm going to drive
my Jeep to go get an oil change well
Bentley takes a quick mid ding nap and
then after that I'm going to come back
we're gonna get ready and we're gonna go
see old old historic downtown Stewart
which is also really close to this
restaurant I ended up researching at
that you can bring your dog on the patio
and possibly watch the Sun set and then
come back pack up the Jeep and get to
bed super early if we're gonna be
staying one extra night in Pittsburgh
but that's still like a 16-hour drive
tomorrow also so upset because of my
laptop died and I needed to upload
today's video and want to go do it this
morning and was like oh my laptops dead
went to go find said laptop charger
wouldn't find it freaked out wondering
if I
it in Charleston but then remembered
that I didn't even use it in Charleston
and then had like a bad memory of when I
was packing being like oh yes I can't
forget my laptop charger but then I was
in such a rush that I don't think I
grabbed it that kind of sucks but
ultimately there's nothing much I can do
about it and you guys have been so
understanding about it on Twitter so
with that we're gonna oil change come
back and get all dolled up for my dinner
date with Bentley tonight and wrap up
you know this little road trip I'm
really sad it's ending but it's not over
yet so how does just keep enjoying it
well it's still here
the coast insulting tonight
show
to stop
birds
stole
Oh
first
day of driving let's do this
feels so good to not be driving in a car
use my face and the fact that I've been
wearing stuff if for 24 hours we're home
we made it the road trip is over which
is slightly sad but also with the amount
of driving we've been doing last two
days what do you think but all Bentley
was so good on this trip guys like so
good he was such a good little traveler
loved chasing all the little lizards and
Florida loved being on the boat I think
we're gonna make this a tradition la is
gonna become a cultured dog so phase one
of my traveling of April is over and I'm
home I'm on a tight schedule today I
have to get ready within the next hour
and head out to a Raptors game but the
minute I hit Canadian soil and I saw
Chiron Oh like the signs richer ah no it
felt so good and like waking up with
palm trees and going to sleep where
there was snow really weird don't get me
wrong I love to travel but it's also
there's nothing better than making
coffee in your own home you know and in
the new mug I got while I was waiting
for my oil change look at how cute this
mug is it's from Pier 1 I hope you guys
enjoy going on this little road trip
with Bentley and I it was such a good
trip I don't know why I haven't done it
sooner but it makes me I don't know it
just made me so happy to see Ben Lee so
happy making it up as we went along and
it was it was definitely an adventure so
now that I'm home I'm gonna jump in the
shower order myself some food because I
have no groceries and get ready for this
Raptors game I hope you guys enjoyed
this vlog I hope you guys are excited
for the coachella which is part two of
April travels and then there's Thailand
oh my god guys this month is insane with
that I'm sure this blogs already so long
so thank you guys for traveling with
Bentley and I on this little road trip I
hope you guys enjoyed it getting a
little peek at the side of our
exploration travels down south I will
give you guys a hint that this won't be
the only peak that you guys get inside
of our travels but that's all I'm gonna
say for now and aside from that I love
you guys I'm gonna back be sure to check
