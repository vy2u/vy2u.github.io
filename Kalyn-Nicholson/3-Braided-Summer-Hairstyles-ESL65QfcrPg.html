showing you three easy braided
hairstyles that I'm going to be rocking
a lot this summer so for this first one
you're going to want to section off the
part of fringe or bangs that you have
and then split it into two a top part
and a bottom part not side by side and
then taking the top part first I'm going
to start French braiding the hair except
every time that I do the French braid
I'm adding a piece from the top of my
head but not adding a piece from the
bottom so you'll notice me here I added
a piece in the top
continue to braid and then just
continued on until I had to add another
piece from the top and not adding a
section to the French braid from the
bottom and just keep on continuing to do
this so you get half way basically half
way back down your head
then once done I'm just tugging on it to
add a little bit more volume to the
braid making it look a little bit
thicker go ahead and secure the braid in
place at the back of your head and then
taking the last section that we have do
the exact same thing that we did before
only French braiding from the top and
just doing it halfway down your head and
then securing it into place
so that is all there is for this
hairstyle you can leave your hair
straight wavy natural or curly and it's
just an easy way to get your fringe or
your bangs off of your face and it's
super easy and very cute for the
summertime so moving on to the second
hairstyle you're going to want to take a
chunk from the top of your head that
doesn't include your bangs or fringe and
then just start French braiding it back
backwards towards the back of section of
your head and then once you get far
enough just completely braid it normally
the whole way down and then again I'm
tugging on it to make it look thicker
adding some more volume to the braid
that's so fine and I'm securing it into
place with a elastic that is the same
color of my hair and then taking the
rest of my hair I'm pulling it back and
then I'm going to add the braid to it
and then add the little bit of front
section which isn't really bangs for me
anymore or fringe and then I'm flying my
fingers to the back and creating a messy
bun at the back of my head this is such
a cute little bohemian way to do a updo
or a bun and get all of your hair off of
your shoulders for the summertime but I
think it looks so cute and it is my two
my all-time favorite hairstyles
so for the third and last braided
hairstyle going to be showing you guys
you're going to want to make a very deep
side part in your hair and then section
forward a piece or a section of hair
just from the very front and pull all
the rest hair of the hair back so that
it doesn't get in the way I'm then Dutch
French braiding if you guys know what
that is just reverse braiding well
basically adding in pieces as you go
extremely tightly to make the braid kind
of thin and small all the way until I
get to the end of my bangs or fringe
don't need change let's not give the
game away
they came in securing that into place
and I'm pulling the rest of my hair back
and creating a ponytail at the back of
my head again this is just a very easy
way to get all of your hair off your
face but it still adds a cute little
touch with the braids in it and so it
doesn't look like just a messy old
ponytail it looks a little bit more done
up and bohemian for these summertime
me neither
this is where
just please
so those are my three favorite braided
hairstyles I'm going to be rocking this
spring and summer let me know down below
which one's your favorite and I'll see
you guys all in a future video bye so
hard to take under precious precious
things from breaking out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
