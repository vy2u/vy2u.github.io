Friday for today's Fitness Friday video
I've decided to do more of like a recipe
style video today I'm gonna be showing
you guys three different smoothie ideas
and all three of these are my favorite
smoothies which is why I wanted to share
them with you guys I know I've been
getting lots of requests to do more
vegan recipes so I've decided to make a
playlist on my second channel which is
my coffee with Kaelyn Channel and on
that channel I'm gonna be uploading some
more vegan recipes so if you're someone
that is vegan or is just interested or
wants some fun healthy recipe then be
sure to check out that channel because
I'm going to definitely start putting
those up so other than that if you guys
are looking for three new smoothie ideas
that are both delicious and nutritious
then just keep watching
so the first smoothie I'm showing you
guys is my favorite and I call it the
chunky monkey and I'm starting by
putting two ripe bananas in and you'll
know the banana is ripe if it has black
spots that's the best time to use them
because they are at their sweetest and
then after that I'm putting in a good
splash of some vanilla almond milk and
then a good spoonful of some natural
peanut butter and I like to get the
crunchy kind just because I like the
texture of it and natural is better but
you guys can use regular if that's what
you have and then I'm just putting two
heaping spoonfuls of cocoa in so it's a
nice mixture of bananas with peanut
butter and chocolate hence why I call it
the chunky monkey and then I just put in
a little bit of ice since I'm not using
frozen bananas it's better to use frozen
bananas but I put in ice if I'm not just
to add a little bit of cold and to make
it more like slushy or smoothie like and
then just a little bit of cold water and
that's all you need
then obviously just blend it all up and
pour and serve and you're good to go
like
it optimist about this
how I'm gonna be you know
so this movie is definitely one of my
favorites and I drink it whenever I'm
craving anything like chocolate or Hardy
like that so it's got that chocolate
peanut butter taste that I crave and
then of course as for the next smoothie
and it is my second favorite one I call
this the pina colada
so I'm putting in some fresh pineapple
but if you guys don't have any fresh
pineapple you could use canned I just
find it tastes better with fresh a
little bit of the pineapple juice and
then some shredded coconut or you could
use coconut milk instead of almond milk
there's a lot of different ways if you
do this but then I'm putting a splash of
vanilla almond milk again and this time
I'm using a frozen banana so I don't
need to add any ice so then just the
frozen banana some cold water and again
blend it pour it and serve and I'm just
using it this little mason jar cup that
I actually picked up from Blogilates
site and I like it because it says
choose to be happy which is very me so
then I just pour it into that and drink
it out of this little tumbler mug and
it's like one of my favorite smoothies
cuz it actually tastes just like a pina
colada
and my final and last favorite smoothie
I like to call it the blueberry muffin
so I just kind of eyeball a good amount
of frozen blueberries into my blender
again some vanilla almond milk and again
you guys can use whatever you guys like
if you like rice milk or soy milk and
then I'm just putting a little bit of
oats but if you're using a frozen banana
you can put less oats but this one for
those of you that don't like bananas if
you're not going to be putting any
banana put more oats and then just a
little dash of some vanilla extract so
again the banana is optional and if
you're not going to be using the banana
just add some more oats and then just
blend it up pour and serve again
so the smoothie is super yummy and it's
my go-to anytime I'm craving any bakery
or pastries it tastes exactly like a
blueberry muffin so thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed these three
healthy smoothies ideas they're all
three are of my favorites and let me
know if you guys decide to try any down
below I'll see you guys all in a future
