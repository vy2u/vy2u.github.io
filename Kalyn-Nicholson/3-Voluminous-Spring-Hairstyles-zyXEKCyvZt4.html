teaming together with resume and their
beautiful volume system to share with
you guys how I get volume in my hair as
well as three really easy spring
voluminous hairstyles
now just as a quick disclaimer as you
guys know I like to try and keep the
products that I use on a day-to-day
basis as cruelty-free as possible now I
am not saying that I am 100% cruelty
free I always like to do research with
the friends that I am working with
before I ever jump on board with
anything so I'm going to leave a link
down below for the statement that I
received from trans men based on whether
or not they were cruelty free and throw
it they said in terms of how they're
being proactive in that you know field
and all of that fun stuff I'll leave
that link down below so you guys can go
check that out for yourself and also
guys I think it is so cool that we've
almost hit 100k on Instagram so if you
are not following me on already I will
put two little links are here to my
Twitter and my Instagram so you guys can
click on them and go ahead and go and
follow me and you know just just come
stop me and then tell me that this video
sent you and I'll stop you guys back you
know anyways I'm gonna stop wasting your
rest time though so you guys want to see
if the really easy voluminous hairstyles
for the spring then just keep watching
so for this video I was able to use the
tresemmé beauty-full volume reverse
wash system which was amazing because it
made such a big difference on the volume
of my hair using the conditioner first I
was able to detangle my hair with my
fingers in the shower and being that the
conditioner is so thick and luxurious I
ripped and rinsed it out and went in
with the shampoo and the shampoo got rid
of all the excess weight from the
conditioner and left my hair with so
much bounce and body and volume and
basically it was just an awesome duo
together so once I'm out of the shower
I'm just gonna go in with the beautiful
volume Maximizer and this is just gonna
keep my hair feeling silky and smooth
and polished once it is dry and then of
course before blow-drying I'm gonna want
to go in with the beautiful volume
mousse and this is just gonna give it
that lightweight airy feeling and add
tons of volume into the roots so I'm
just massaging this into my damp hair
and then I'm just blow-drying my hair as
usual and I like to blow-dry my hair
upside down again just to give some
added volume brushing it through and
then just adding a quick heat protectant
to make sure we're protecting against
any heat damage to our hair
and then afterward I'm going to go in
and curl my hair with a curling wand
I'll leave the exact size of the curling
wand that I use down below but basically
what I'm doing is using a thicker barrel
and then curling all of the pieces away
from my face on both sides and I
normally don't do this in layers but if
you're someone that is looking for an
even extra amount of volume doing this
in layers is going to create a lot more
body and bounce to your hair
so before doing any styling I'm just
gonna make sure to hairspray the hair in
place with the beautiful volume
hairspray which left my hair without any
crunch and soft and touchable I'm just
going to start the first hairstyle by
taking a chunk of hair closer down by
your ear you're gonna want to be able to
pull it from a place that you're not
going to be able to see where the braid
is starting from and then pull it up
comb it back a little bit and then
create a braid
and then I'm just using a small clear
elastic to secure the braid into place
combing the hair back from the top of my
head to go behind the braid and then
putting the braid down on the other side
and tucking it behind some hair before
Bobby pinning it and then that is all
you have to do this hairstyle I do
recommend teasing a little bit at the
top just to make sure that the hair
falls nicely but then other than that
that's all you have to do add a little
bit more hairspray and you are set to go
I think this hairstyle is super super
cute for the springtime and I'm
definitely gonna be wearing a lot
probably for Easter so then for this
next hairstyle you're gonna want to make
sure that you have a side part and I'm
just taking a large chunk from the
larger portion of my hair and then I'm
going to be doing like a half French
braid if that makes any sense
so basically you're gonna want to add
pieces from the top but don't add pieces
from the bottom so once you're done
you'll have the braid kind of falling
towards the back and be sure to kind of
braid in the direction that you want the
braid to go in and then secure it into
place with an elastic and some bobby
pins being sure to tuck some hair over
top of it so that you can't see where
the elastic is and then that is all you
have to do for this braid another tip
too is that you can pull at the braid if
you want to make it a bigger braid or
have it have more volume
and then for the last and final
hairstyle I'm just taking a portion of
the hair at the top of my head back
combing it just a little bit and hair
spraying it before securing it with an
elastic and this is a really really hair
easy hairstyle to do but I find adding a
little bit of teasing and using the
products itself added more volume to it
and then I'm just taking a chunk from
the back of the ponytail wrapping it
around and Bobby pinning it into place
and then just kind of playing around
with the ponytail a bit teasing it and
pulling the two sides extra tight so
that they fall on either side so that
one's really easy to do but again I
think all three of these hairstyles are
so cute for spring and I'm definitely
gonna be rocking them a lot
so that was it for my three easy
voluminous spring hairstyles let me know
down below which one was your favorite
and I will see all of you guys in a
future video bye guys love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
