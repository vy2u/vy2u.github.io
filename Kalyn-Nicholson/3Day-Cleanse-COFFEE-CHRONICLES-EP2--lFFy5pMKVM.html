my channel for today's video we're doing
an episode two of the coffee chronicles
and today's video is gonna be all about
cleansing at a couple nights recently
where I ordered takeout and just like
let myself feel like all crappy and I
got that out of my system and with that
and with starting these coffee
chronicles I wanted to start the whole
reset button and just feeling good and
feeling fresh about my life by doing a
cleanse with you guys so over the next
three days we're going to be cleansing
all things we're starting with a juice
cleanse we're gonna go in just like some
yoga we can talk about yoga we can talk
about cleansing energies there's just
like there's a couple things I kind of
have planned the next few days to get
myself feeling all refreshed like my
palate has just been cleared off ready
to just explore not that you're ever not
ready to explore and live life but even
more ready you guys are following me
already be sure to check out my Twitter
and my Instagram I'll pop some links
down below I've been tweeting and
instagramming all of the stuff I've been
doing lately including the juice recipes
and stuff so if you guys ever want to
see sneak peeks of what's gonna be going
out in these coffee chronicles aka a
peak of a life beforehand then
definitely go check those out this book
that I'm reading called the light of
yoga I think that's what it's called I
can double check exactly what it's
called
light of life the yoga journey and there
was this big section of it when I was
driving back from my hometown last night
that was all about sleep and if you
really realized just like how much even
though I have been sleeping and I've
been really really good at going to bed
early I still wake up periodically
through the night so between that and
just feeling kind of tired and lethargic
and my brain has been feeling like kind
of muddy there's just been like a couple
things that I've noticed in terms of my
body and overall just how I feel that I
really it wanted to take a couple days
to just do a cleanse and feel like
refreshed again one of the things that I
actually brought back from Kingston for
my
house was my juicer funny how the
universe works sometimes where things
just seems cohesively just fit together
so nicely because I was looking up ways
to just like cleanse her energy into get
good sleeps and to cleanse your body
something that popped up was doing a
juice cleanse and I was like oh my god
my juicers in the Jeep I could do a
juice cleanse I'm gonna be doing a
three-day juice cleanse I've never known
a juice cleanse before it was a couple
tips that I ride like drinking a juice
every two to two-and-a-half hours to
keep yourself full and I have a wack ton
of recipes that I wrote down to make
sure that I'm like playing around with
it and stuff cuz I want to have fun with
it too
it started out today I also did my yoga
this morning Bentley and I went for a
run by the water that's another thing
I've been trying to get Bentley to do
with me lately building up the strength
of my knee again because I damaged my
knee a couple months ago when I was
running and so now that it's healed I'm
slowly incorporating running back into
my workout regimen so I'm running three
days a week and I bring Dudley with me
once or twice so today we went for just
a three and a half kilometer run it was
short and sweet but for a little 5 pound
dog this pretty pretty he's pretty good
I started my morning off with some
orange Jun I'm one of the big ones this
morning for breakfast and then I made
what I like to call or I discovered I'm
going to call it the pine apple elixir
let's start this juice cleanse
shall we actually learn how to use this
juicer again so I just bought a couple
orange juices for when I can't freshly
press lots of components to this
okay that's it let's get juicing
I was scared of dentist in the die and I
was scared of pretty girls and starting
conversations oh my friends are turning
green okay so first juice first taste
that oh my god this is actually a really
good holy
that's not normal hi we're gonna be one
of those people of juices now I feel it
in my bones
hey Siri define elixir I'm a magical or
medicinal potion the apple elixir heaven
and so now we're rolling into the
afternoon I'm actually about to go meet
with my friend Kat with a little bit of
shopping and we're gonna hit a juice box
let's kind of where my days at day one
of my cleanse and nestled in grab
yourself either a month of coffee or
agenda juice because hey we're cleansing
let's get to today's coffee Chronicle
Ephesus Sean boy he's running from
itself and she's been living on the
highest shelf
they come on start
to the side
you should just go tell the round two
ere we go that will get your bag totaled
honestly
I just gotta I just gotta know
I can have it I can have it
the way a / she's okay for the screen so
there's one thing that I'm learning from
juicing is that it is really freaking
messy just made myself a bag of carrots
romaine lettuce ginger pineapple about a
half a pineapple and that's it Cheers
he's way better than I was participating
I thought what the carrots and the
ginger it was gonna be a little bitter
like one of those juices that you're
like trying to kind of gazel down oh my
god I think it's the pineapple juice I
feel like people pineapple juice and
anything it just becomes magical
pineapples are about when you're singing
that song I'm gonna love them up though
let's see I'm gonna sing the words wrong
to the riptide taken away through the
dark side I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
and I got a lump in my throat cause
you're gonna sing the words wrong
it's like it or lump in my throat cause
you're gonna sing the words wrong live
sweet you birthday and I got your
everything's magic Brown sevens or you
dare not love them my cat the duck face
you look like my next mistake loves a
game wanna play
okay so this juice I want to look up
quickly the benefits seeing as we're
doing the cleanse
as you guys would have seen in the clips
last night the juice three that we went
to it had all the labels that told you
like what each juice does in terms of
like helping your body obscene as we're
making recipes or like making potions
with fruits and vegetables I love it so
beets manage your blood pressure they
give you a glowing skin of beet roots
are rich in vitamin C which help with
clearing blemishes so skin care dope
because I'm all about the skin right now
detoxifying anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant so it's good detox and the
thing about the line in this too is it's
like it's what cuts through the because
I thought it was gonna be super bland
but the line makes it kind of sour this
one's got like some kick to it with the
lime and ginger so it prevents heart
disease another but we're just a stroke
lowers cholesterol prevents cancer whose
community it's good for your skin
alright and then last but not least
ginger blood pressure digestion and
prevents kids so this is definitely a
really good juice for your blood
pressure as we know from all three good
for your skin its detoxifying it's good
for your heart it's anti-inflammatory
and it's good for digestion I feel like
we should call it something like heart
something to do with the heart I'll call
it happy heart this is the happy heart
juice I like that better than vampire
they started off this morning up with
another orange juice if I get a chance I
kind of want to go and grab the oranges
to start making the orange juice fresh
in the morning too because I figure why
not for tea juicing so and then I'm
probably gonna make another one in about
two hours I have enough work to do but
now that my yoga flow is done
there's no workout today or I want to go
get a new plant from this plant store
that I was like researching last night I
was creeping there Instagram guys their
Instagram is everything I didn't want my
life to be
it's called dynasty and
their plants today I also need to get
some planting soil and I need to replant
one of my succulents we're gonna do some
plant things today because it's a rainy
gloomy cloudy Tuesday it's a good day to
just like work on my plant family and I
have a lot of just like editing and work
to do so that's the day progresses we
shall touch base but I'll probably make
my next juice
hello good morning and happy third day
of the juice cleanse so it is currently
Wednesday I am sippin on this Green
Goddess I don't know what we're gonna
call this one but it's very green very
packed with nutrients very refreshing
again I started my morning out with
orange juice become like a ritual of
mine now I'll have a coffee then I'll
have an orange juice and then I chill
and do like my emails on my computer
work every morning that's when my
mornings started though it's actually
closing in on 11:00 now so this is kind
of like my morning snack juice I'm gonna
go for a run in a bit I'm meeting up
with Kat later to shoot some photos for
my blog but just in general my blog post
that I'm writing this week is all about
balancing using the elements and so
today I really want to focus on you know
cleansing the energy and all of that fun
stuff so we're gonna get into all of
that today because you know what cleanse
I feel like isn't just about cleansing
your body it's got to be about cleansing
your mind cleansing your soul and all
the in-between including getting plants
like Luna
well I'm obsessed with but aside from
that Cheers just wanna give you guys an
update but look it have been a while
since we had talked I swear if you put
lime or pineapple in your juices
game-changer
our new pal Luna okay updates live from
Luna is currently snacking on some dates
and I've still been kind of snacking on
dates bananas and pre-made orange juice
from the grocery store periodically
while I'm working throughout the day but
like this obsession with dates right now
my second goal today no they taste of
caramel candies those getting ready
right now and two of my makeup in my
hair but really quick I wanted to give
you guys a little before-and-after
because one of the biggest things that
I've noticed with this cleanse
especially with the juicing is the
difference in my body and my skin like
my skin if you guys saw the last coffee
chronicles you'll remember this in the
difference of my skin men like even
where I was breaking out and stuff like
the difference when I wake up in the
morning or even just in general without
makeup I feel like my skin looks like it
has more pigment my eyes look brighter
guzzling down vitamins six seven times a
day make sure they're French no further
ado see how it does with makeup that
already snaps to block those pictures
come back and make a dinner juice
okay dinner in a jar this is actually
surprisingly very good this is like
tomato juice on crack that side I'm also
making mushroom it's taking everything
out I mean not to order sushi right now
it's instead of making myself some
teriyaki mushrooms which are damn it
probably my bed you juice tomorrow I'm
getting myself so much sushi disabled
you can play today the juice fast is
over it's officially Thursday so I think
I'm going to still start out for my
mornings with juice and then just switch
over to like you know salads foods for
foods at like lunchtime I'm gonna go buy
oranges today I've been drinking like 1
to 2 of these every morning and they're
like they're $4 of juice and it's like 4
bucks for me to get a full thing of
oranges so that's next up on the list I
might even make fresh orange juice this
weekend for mimosas it's what I call
balance so I just did my morning
meditation and I kind of went through
this cleanse that I've been doing I
didn't even fully realize or recognize
it as a whole but with deciding that I
wanted to explain it to you guys I
realized that there's kind of a common
theme that I've been doing with my
meditations lately hey let me back the
camera first things first when I go to
meditate I try to just like clear clear
my mind and by doing that I just count
my breaths it's something that I learned
from the headspace app and so when I
find that my brain is really struggling
I count a couple deep breaths until I
fall into it usually the placement of my
hands it's a weird thing that I don't
even know why but I kind of take it a
little seriously when I'm meditating so
if my hands are up that usually means
that I'm like asking for something from
the universe and trying to manifest
something you know help my hands are
down it usually means that I'm like kind
of being a little bit more introspective
I'm looking inwards to find some answers
it's just my own made-up things that I
have concocted in my brain but my little
Buddha guy over there he
it's his hands like I usually put my
hands like this when I'm feeling content
like I have one hand that's
introspective one hand that's
manifesting but this is more of like
that I'm really content with life right
now kind of thing and if you want to
send something to me cool if any answers
want to boil up cool it's like a bit of
both
well sometimes I'll do this too this is
like I'm not trying to manifest anything
I'm just trying to clear my brain out
and what's the other one oh and the my
last one is this is like if my hands are
like this or like this it's like hold
dear god help me I'm praying for
something and then so when it comes to
cleansing my energies especially with
this overall cleanse that we've been
doing I'll roll through you know the
three pillars of my body and soul by
checking in first with my mind and just
seeing kind of what thoughts boil up if
this is again something that I used to
try not to do with meditation because
you're supposed to not be thinking again
is something I learned from the
headspace app though and something that
I find super helpful is sometimes he's
just like let your brain just think what
it wants to think and I think that
that's actually really important when it
comes to meditation I tend to think
about 100 miles a second so when I just
check in with my mind and I just let any
thoughts that want to come through
bubble up then I have a pretty good
indication or a pretty good example of
where my brain is that either my
thoughts coming up are super positive or
they're super negative or maybe there's
some worries or anxieties popping up and
just kind of look at them and question
okay where is my mind out right now and
once I let up of thoughts boil through I
take like a sponge or I envision kind of
like a sponge being like condensed
dropping into my mind and just soaking
it all up and once they soak it all up
and turf the sponge and I try and like
bathe my brain in good happy golden
sunlight if that makes sense
I moved to my body and I just do a
general scan and I try and check into
every body part I can think of on the
way down and just see how it feels
because when you take a second to kind
of Zone your energy or zone your
attention there you'll instantly have
some sort of feeling whether you're
thinking about how your brain is like my
brain felt a little money a couple days
ago today it felt super clear when it
comes to even feeling like my legs like
I went for
yesterday so today my legs feel a little
lethargic I like to just take a sponge
soak up all the energies kind of turf
the sponge and then just bathe my body
or envision bathing my body in golden
sunlight and then last but not least Sol
I like to check in to where my soul is
that it's usually just an overall like
checking in with I guess my Higher Self
or where my spirit is that is my spirit
feeling just a little draining does it
feeling a little peppy happy whatever
soak up all that energy turf the sponge
and then just bathe it in golden happy
trusting sunlight to kind of create the
last thing bit of that cleansing energy
I try and sink all three together I like
to follow it all up with any sort of
like mantra affirmations any sort of
affirmative word or positive thing that
I can kind of stick to it just to keep
that cleansed energy and then at the
very end of the meditation I like to try
and picture the sinking of all three
elements kind of coming together and
just feeling that new clean slate to
just like open my eyes and move on with
my day
that's kind of like the cleansing energy
or the cleansing meditations that I like
to do and my general explanation of them
I wouldn't say I 100% juice because I
was still eating like bananas and dates
and I would still pick up fruit but I
mean realistically I ate raw for three
days and drank I would say about 90% of
my meals between that getting to bed on
time this week and just doing all these
these other little tiny like cleansing
things to actually do feel a huge shift
in how I felt going into this week
versus now that it's Thursday so I think
I might continue to cycle these like
little mini juice cleanses like maybe
once a month just take 2 to 3 days and
juice because juicing things has become
my new favorite paper thing in the world
so with that I hope you guys enjoyed
this cleansing coffee Chronicles if you
guys decide to do your own kind of
cleanse let me know and leave a comment
down below side from that I love you
guys to them in the back thank you guys
