a hair routine and some hairstyle ideas
so I decided to do this video for you
guys today and I'm just showing you guys
here which shampoos and conditioners I
use I use the sterling pearl purple
shampoo for my blond hair and I'll also
leave down below just the toner that
Meggie uses to get the color of blond
hair that I do have since that's also
something that has asked a lot but
basically long story short here are just
a few of the things that I've been using
lately as well as the curling iron that
I use pretty much to curl my hair every
single day I believe it's a 1 and 1/2
inch but I will double check again and
leave it below and also I never forget
heat protectant I'm really trying to
grow my hair out recently so if you guys
want a full tips and routine just let me
know and as for some fun and easy fall
hairstyles I'm going to show you guys
just a few of my favorites so for the
first one just go ahead and part your
hair on the side now this was also
highly requested that I show you guys
how I do this so then all I'm doing is
just sectioning off the front of the
less hair side I guess that makes sense
I hope so and then I'm just sectioning
that off into 3 layers and then pinning
the top two layers off to the side so
that we can Dutch braid the bottom
we go
Oh
we grow
so then as I said up before I'm just
Dutch braiding each section so if you
guys don't know what Dutch braiding is
it's pretty much reverse French braiding
so instead of turning the strands inward
to do it outwards and then I'm just
doing that with all three layers until I
am finished and then you can use bobby
pins to kind of place them where you
want them to lay on your head but if you
do braid them tight enough it should be
fine and then you just let the rest of
your hair go and you can leave the rest
of your hair straight or you can curl it
you can get funky with it but that's
pretty much how I do just like the three
little cornrows on the side of my head
you
so another hairstyle that I've been
loving lately is the half-up bun now
there's two ways that I'll usually do
this one of them is like this where I
leave my side part sort of visible and I
just play around with the hair till I
get it like I want it by the way guys
I'm using second second day hair in
these hairstyles so it might look a
little bit more messy than usual but
then I just put a little bit of a claw
in my hip bun if that makes any sense I
just call my fingers through and then
bun the top section of the hair and pull
it pieces to frame my face holy I can't
talk right now or I'll actually just
pull all the hair up and do the same
thing so then it looks a little bit more
like this one here so I decided to show
you guys both ways since they're both
probably my go-to on lazy day so then
for the next hairstyle you're just going
to want to have a side part in your hair
and then take the front section of your
head and just go ahead and Dutch braid
it again but I guess for this one you
could French braid it - it doesn't
really matter which way so I'm just
going ahead and Dutch braiding all the
way down until I get to the bottom of
the hair and then securing it in place
and then just pull forward a section
from the other side of your head and go
ahead and do another French or Dutch
braid and if this braid looks a little
thin then just fluff it out with your
fingers by pulling on the pieces before
you secure it into place then with the
rest of my hair I'm just pulling it back
and doing a low bun and again I'm just
going to take my fingers and kind of
make a claw I know that sounds weird but
then just comb the claw right into the
ponytail so that it makes a super messy
bun this has just always been my
favorite way of doing it and I find it
makes it the messiest so yeah just go
ahead and do that and then make a low
set messy bun on your head and then I'm
just going to take each French or Dutch
braid and then bobby pin them back I'm
just kind of lining it around the head
and um pinning it just on to the top of
the bun and then pinning a little bit of
the bun over top where I use the bobby
pins to pin the braid so you can't tell
and then just fluffing out a little bit
of the top layer so that's all there is
to this hairstyle super easy and really
cute for the Fall
and lately my favorite way of doing my
messy bun is as follows since this is
something I often get asked and
requested as well so all I do is pull
all the hair to the top my head and I
make sure that I'm not pulling it super
tight to my scalp I actually form the
bun a little bit higher so that the hair
on my head sits a little more loose if
that makes any sense and again I just
use my hand as a claw stick all my
fingers through the ponytail and then
there's wrap it around two times or
three times if you can and then pull out
some pieces to pray my face this is
super easy and definitely my lazy day
go-to but one of my favorite hairstyles
and I just love when people just rock a
really cool messy bun it's like one of
my favorite looks so yeah that is all
that there is to my messy bun so I hope
you guys enjoyed my fall hairstyles and
just getting to know a little bit more
of my hair routine if you guys want a
full like diagnostic of what I do for my
hair and all of that I can definitely do
that for you guys but other than that
I'll see you guys all in a future video
bye guys
