for today's video I'm going to be doing
another adulting 101 video since it's
been a while since I've uploaded one for
you guys I figured if you guys have been
watching my recent videos you probably
already know this but it has been like a
recent goal of mine to kind of for lack
of a better word get my together I was
starting to create terrible habits that
were causing me to self-sabotage and not
get the things done that I wanted to do
so the moment that I realized that this
was happening was when I asked myself
the question okay what is most important
to me basically I got very clear about
where I wanted to be and what I wanted
to be working towards and once I knew
what that was I then took a step back
and said okay now where is all of my
time going and that was kind of where
the earth shattered for me okay these
are all the things that I want to
harvest out of my life but this is what
I'm doing with the time that I have I'm
wasting it watching TV I'm wasting it
procrastinating online I'm wasting it on
my phone I'm wasting it doing things or
pushing off things and I know I should
be doing right now but you know the
little monkey inside my head that just
wants to have fun and do the easy things
and get the easy way out kept on pushing
off all of the things that I knew I
should be doing beating myself up for
not doing these things and all of that
fun stuff which kept me in that negative
mindset keeping me going on and on in
this cycle I can ramble on about how
this all came to be
but long story short if you're watching
this and you're resonating with anything
I just said then these are the tips and
steps that I've been taking for the last
I would say a month and a half to
basically get my together so step
number one is to be extremely honest
with yourself because it's not going to
do you any good if you aren't and to
find where your problems are your
problem could be that you're feeling
uninspired unhappy unmotivated whatever
it is figure it out what is your issue
what are you feeling why are you feeling
that way really really clear on your bad
habits you know like sleeping through
your alarm or
sedating thanks to the very last day or
not going to the gym right eating
healthy or whatever your bad habits are
even if it's in terms of socializing if
you're wanting to work on the
relationships in your life and you're
wanting to grow the amount of people you
are around every day or the amount of
people that make an influence on you and
that you make an influence on them if
you want to grow and expand your
relationships but you notice you have
terrible social habits even that is
clarifying you know this is where I'm
going wrong this is what my problem is
and like I said a really really good way
to do this is to establish what it is
you're trying to work towards for your
life and then take a step back but what
am I actually spending my time on so
first and foremost you can't fix the
problem if you don't define the problem
which leads me into step number two and
this is always the funnest part about
getting your life back on track and
that's getting inspired and tying that
back into the last point that I just
made if you have no idea what you're you
know your drive and your focus wants to
be towards if you have no idea what kind
of goals you want to set for yourself or
what kind of life you want to be living
and that is why you feel like you're
wasting your time then look around and
find somebody that's living a life that
you are envious of and I'm not saying
like envious at a bad way because
jealousy that's like other video I can
make but I just mean who is killing it I
like who do you look at and go god damn
I wish I had that life or god damn I
wish I was doing those things maybe on
say it could be your next-door neighbor
it could be someone that is living a
happy and content life just being
married with a family it could be
someone traveling the world it could be
someone in Broadway it could be anybody
find somebody where you're like that is
exactly the life I want to live or that
is exactly the morals I want to have or
that's exactly you know the
self-discipline I want figure out the
kind of life and the kind of morals and
the type of personality traits that you
want to acquire I wish I was the type of
person who and fill in that blank which
I was the type of person that got up at
6:00 a.m. to go for a run I wish I was
the type of person that meal prepped my
meals or I wish I was a type of person
that walked into a room and was friends
with everybody I wish I was the type of
person that was filming videos every
single day and traveling the world or
whatever it is
when you come up with this alter-ego
whoever whoever's life it was that you
were envious of or you can even just do
this and create your own name create
your own alter-ego and say this is my
alter-ego and this version of me is the
person that gets up at 6:00 a.m. is the
person that goes for runs is the person
that meal perhaps does these things
travels the world and so that kind of
forces you to get out of the I am not
that way and put you in the mindset that
I already am that way so it's a no
brainer I'm going to do the things that
make me that person this sounds
ridiculous and far too easy but it
actually works other ways to get
inspired are to change things up change
your surroundings work with what you
have talked to people around you
basically what I'm saying here is align
your thoughts and your actions with your
insight in mind and that's going to gain
you momentum and get you inspired and if
you guys are still listening to me say
all these things and thinking to
yourself yeah I say I'm going to do all
these things but I'm probably actually
won't there are two types of people in
this world there are people who are
reactive and there are people that are
proactive you can be the reactive person
sit back watch your life flash before
your eyes and just constantly be
reacting to it you're not proactively
going after things you're just letting
life happen pretending you have no
control over it and then being reactive
and emotional about it and thinking life
is unfair and again thus completes the
cycle or you can be a proactive person
and you can stop making excuses you can
start finding the inspiration and you
can start going for things and even if
you don't end up getting exactly what
you want you're going to end up pretty
damn close so tie that back in what I'm
saying here is get inspired and get
excited about the things that you want
to start changing in your life which
leads me in to tip number three which is
probably one of the most crucial steps
in this and one that we often tend to
veer off course this is usually the part
where we get to and then we drop off and
it's cultivating a plan you can have all
the inspiration and all the motivation
in the world but if you have no set plan
no set rules or guidelines for yourself
you're not going to know what the hell
you're doing or where you're going when
you put rules and guidelines on yourself
you're actually giving yourself more
freedom and I know that sounds
contradictive but think of it like this
if you were to take the time to come up
with not only a routine or a schedule
for yourself but also just some hard and
fast rules
for instance I don't stay up past
midnight I get up at this time every
single day
I'm meal prep every Thursday and every
Sunday those are hard and fast rules
that I have set for myself that I will
not let myself break free from that
gives me way more time way more freedom
to use my brainpower on other things so
cultivate a plan that's going to get you
back on track for whatever you feel like
you need to be getting back on track for
whether that be you know making a meal
plan for yourself making a workout
schedule for yourself get as details
about your plan and your rules as
possible so that you know exactly what
you should be doing at which time and
don't go overboard with this be sure to
give yourself that reward for every time
you work hard too don't think if you
can't put aside any time for leisure
don't think like you can't put any side
of time to just not have a plan just
make sure that that is part of your plan
you know like every Sunday I don't plan
anything those days I just do whatever I
want so that I don't get tapped out and
I don't get frustrated and overwhelmed
and lastly tip number four and this is
the second most popular place where we
all drop off and this is actually where
I tend to drop off is that I love the
planning process it is my favorite part
if you asked me to plan a schedule from
now until the end of me being 40 years
old I would probably love every single
second of it but then when it came to
doing it that is usually where my
troubles alive you actually have to now
do it just do it
stop thinking about it stop talking
about it in a lot of ways when we say
that we're unmotivated about things what
we're really saying is that we just
don't feel like doing it spending all
this time thinking about doing it and
looking for thoughts and mindsets that
are gonna somehow magically make us do
it but in all reality if you just do it
it's done and not only that it'll create
a domino effect and get the ball rolling
for you to do the next thing and the
next thing and the next thing our
thought process is usually what talks us
out of doing the things that we want to
be doing most because we think we're
gonna fail or we think this will go
wrong or we think that what's the point
we've become accustomed to not want to
really work for anything anymore and so
when we see anything is this huge
daunting task our action just goes hello
I'm not doing that that seems like it's
going to take way too long so break it
down and make it so that each task and
each daily to-do is going to give you
that sense of
small gratification and then act on it
do it just do it yes you can in the book
you are badass which I've talked about a
million times you guys probably so sick
of hearing about it
she says this one quote that is like
people who want to change the lives will
find a way and people who really don't
will find an excuse so it's totally up
to you you can find a way to get things
back on track and feel like you're
really working towards the life that you
strive for or you can find an excuse not
to and at the end of the day the only
person is hurting is yourself the only
person that's going to be unhappy for
you not doing these things is you
because it's what you really wanted a
life and you're the only one who can
make yourself get it so there you have
it those are the four most important
guidelines into which I have felt like
I've really put my life back on track
and so for any of you guys that are
watching what it might feel like you've
been in a bit of a rut or you couldn't
get motivated and especially during
these winter months then I'm telling you
just try these four steps even if you
just do it for a week and see if it
makes any difference on your mindset on
your motivation and on your life because
I am going to bet a lot of money that it
will I love you guys to the moon and
back I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and other than that I'm going to go do
all the other things that I have on my
schedule for today so I'll see you guys
all in my next video bye guys great
you're free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
