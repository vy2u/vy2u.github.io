don't touch your body
yeah me I could touch your body cuz only
you know I know you know I don't you
don't trust nobody bake me look under-19
bunny like P P P P P hey guys and
welcome back to my channel for today's
eat over video I am bringing back a
Fitness Friday I figured it with the
chillier months coming and we can no
longer you know just casually workout
outdoors anymore at least for those of
us that are a little bit further up
north today I'm gonna share with you
guys of four different methods of
working out from home for those of you
guys that don't have the money for a gym
membership or maybe it's starting to get
cold where you live or maybe you just
don't want to leave your house as I
totally get that
so let's not waste time shall we
first method that I recommend is
actually using YouTube because YouTube
is filled with so many different Fitness
youtubers now you can find yoga videos
online and you can find like circuit
training videos online so many different
things that right here for free because
that's the greatest thing about the
interweb me personally I love the yoga
with Adriene video that's probably my
favorite workout to do from home I'll
roll out my yoga mat and I'll play one
of her videos and kind of follow along
she's just so soothing there is a
certain comfort level to with doing yoga
from home you're in your own element
you're in your own zone as well as I
used to do a lot of these circuit videos
that Blogilates would post like the ones
that are more target toned for like arms
or abs or butt or things like that
the second method that I'm going to
recommend to you guys is to do some
strength training at home so you can go
out and buy five-pound weights or ankle
weights but even if you don't do that
there's so many bodyweight exercises
that you can do like push-ups and sit up
I highly recommend going online with a
couple different circuit training or
strength training workouts that you can
do from home and then create a system
for yourself where it's like okay monday
is arm day and Wednesday's abs and then
Friday is like legs and butt and then
those three nights of the week just cut
out like 30 minutes of time of your
night or your morning that you're at
home and just do like a really intense
circuit training you can like blare your
tunes and yeah and tip for you guys is
if you want to follow like an actual
like workout plan one of my favorites is
the caila it signs I always forget how
to say her last name but her bikini body
like workout program I actually
purchased it last year and I still use
it to this day it is incredible it has
amazing strength training workouts in
there that you can do rate at your place
third method I have to share with you
guys is at-home cardio which you might
be thinking like what how do I do cardio
at home you can dance which to be honest
this is my favorite form of at-home
cardio I will blare music and I'm not
kidding you dance for like 30 minutes by
myself it sounds weird and I got really
into it really truly and honestly wish
that I never quit dance when I was
younger I'm not even telling my body to
do it it just it just happens but some
other forms of at-home cardio could be
jumping jacks you could do it for like a
full song then take a break for like 30
seconds then put on a different song and
do it again you can do it like burpees
you could do fake skipping like on the
spot and like swing your arms as if
you're actually skipping on a skipping
rope
and my last and final method is to give
yourself like mini challenges so you can
do like a wall sit or lunges while you
brush your teeth and have like when
you're watching your favorite TV show
commercial break circuits where every
time there's a commercial break you do
some sort of workout if you are somebody
that's sitting on the couch or at your
desk you can like find different
challenges or workouts that you could do
sitting in your chair you put something
in the microwave maybe you drop down and
just do sit-ups until done different
things like that where you challenge
yourself in many ways that maybe you're
not doing a full workout right in one go
but just tiny little challenges from
home so those were the four methods of
working out from home that I had to show
you guys if you guys have any
recommendations or any tips tricks or
hacks for working out at home be sure to
leave it in the comment section down
below so that we can all you know help
each other out I hope you guys enjoyed
this episode of Fitness Friday and I
will see all of you guys in tomorrow's a
YouTube video bye guys rocks go - hi
