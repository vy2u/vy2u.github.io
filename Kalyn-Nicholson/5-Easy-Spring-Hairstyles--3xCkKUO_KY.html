to be doing some really fun spring
hairstyles I recently asked what type of
spring videos you guys wanted to see and
this was one that popped up quite a bit
so today I'm going to be showing you
five different hairstyles for the spring
there's lots of braids and fish tails
and just a bunch of fun little
hairstyles and you can easily make your
own little twist on them by adding
headbands or curls or whatever you
decide to do so if you guys want to see
five really easy fun and bright and cute
spring hairstyles then just keep
watching
so this first hairstyle is super easy
and very very cute for spring so I'm
just starting by taking a huge chunk of
my hair on the side of my hairline that
has more hair so I suggest you do a side
part with this and then I just split
that chunk into two and started to
fishtail now if you guys don't know how
to fishtail all you do is take a chunk
from the outside cross it over like an X
towards the inside and you just keep
doing this back and forth on each side
till you get all the way down it takes a
little bit longer than a braid but it
looks really cool
and I did this with beach waves but you
could do it with curls or Street
though this next hairstyle is really
easy and it's just a little twist on
your average braid so pull your hair to
one side and section it into three
groups and then I'm just securing one
group away so I don't lose it and then
I'm just taking one of these sections
and creating a braid and then I'm taking
that and just braiding it in as if it
was a chunk of hair into the braid so
it's technically two braids and one I've
been seeing this one a lot of places
lately and I just think it's really cute
you could add some curls to frame your
face and that's it
so this next hairstyle is really cute
and what I'm gonna be doing is using
some of my Pantene dry defy which you
can put this in dry or damp hair and all
the way up to your roots and it's just
gonna make my hair nice and silky and
easy it's your easier to manage
so I'm securing my hair on the top of my
head in a bun just like this and then
what I'm gonna do is just tighten the
beginning so that it pulls down closer
to my scalp and then section it into two
parts then taking the hair from the back
of my head that's sticking out of our
bun we're gonna wrap that right over top
of it to create a little bow wrap it
around and then secure it into place
this looks like you have a huge hair bow
in your hair but it's actually your real
hair and I just think this is really
cute and you could add headbands if you
really wanted to or you could just leave
a plain since it is quite adorable on
all all on its own so again for this
next hairstyle I suggest a side pirate
and I just brushed out my hair then took
a huge chunk towards the front and
started to French Dutch braid it so I'm
doing a Dutch braid but adding pieces as
I go and the Dutch braid is just doing a
normal braid but reverse so instead of
weaving inwards you weave outwards so
I'm just doing that all the way down and
then securing it and then I'm going to
go ahead and do the same thing on the
other side of my head then just go ahead
and pull out the braid to create more
volume just pull little pieces out
towards the end of it and it's gonna
make your braids look a lot bigger then
just wrap the RIC braids towards the
back claw your fingers through your hair
and create a little messy bun at the low
nape of your neck and that is all there
is to this cute hairstyle for spring so
easy and very cute for any spring
occasion
and as for my last hairstyle which is a
personal favorite of mine I just threw
in my extension and put a high ponytail
on the top of my head and again I'm
doing a fishtail so I've sectioned it
into two parts and then I'm taking
pieces from the outside and wrapping
them and cross like an X and adding it
to the beginning of the other side and
just doing this all the way down and
then once I get to the very bottom I'm
going to secure it into place and you
can see it made a really really cute
high fishtail here but then I'm just
going to take two little chunks from the
edge of the hair and wrap it back
through the elastic to create our own
little hair bow towards the end of the
fishtail this is a really easy way to
end off a braid or a fishtail and it
just looks really cute and I love this
hairstyle for working out or even with
like a nice dress or romper for the
springtime so those were all of my easy
fun hairstyles for the spring I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you all in a
future video bye guys
I like
for the son</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
