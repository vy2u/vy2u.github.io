were cold hey guys so for today's video
I have teamed up with Playtex to bring
you these five different fitness acts so
some of these are going to be kind of
beauty related and some of them are just
kind of more so just things that you
should keep or hacks you should know
when it comes to going to the gym we're
just working up general or your gym bag
or haircare or whatever it is so if you
guys like this video then just give it a
thumbs up and maybe I could do a part
two to this and do another gym hacks
video or anything else Fitness Friday
related feel free to leave it down below
so other than that just keep watching to
find out my five fitness hacks so for my
first hack I'm going to teach you guys
how to make this little DIY beg for a
tampon or pad so that you can hide it or
keep it discreetly in your gym bag so
all your going to need is some material
of your choice I chose this little
tie-dye material from Walmart and then
I'm just cutting out around the pad and
making sure to flip it over so that it
can fold and fit it in perfectly and I'm
going to just leave a little bit of
extra material on each end so that I can
make it like a little envelope so then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
a pad in it to make sure that it fits
leaving the extra space at top at the
top just like I said so that I can fold
it over and then I'm just using some
fabric stitch or fabric glue to just
glue the little envelope pocket in place
you guys could always just use a little
makeup bag too but I just thought this
was a cute little way of doing it
yourself and seeing how I'm assuming
we're all girls here the pads that I'm
using here of the new plate export
ultra-thin pads which are really good
for working out because they help wick
away moisture to keep you really dry and
fresh while exercising then then just to
personalize it a little more I'm using
this a fabric mat gel to write Shark
Week just because I thought that that
would be a funny little quote to put on
the front and it kind of relates to
exactly what it's meant for
then you'll want to leave it to dry for
about four to six hours and once done
just go ahead and put your pad or tampon
in and then it's an easy discreet little
way of keeping them in your bag so my
next fitness hack is to always leave
conditioner or some leave-in conditioner
on the ends of your hair I'll always
just add a little dollop or a little
coat of conditioner to the ends of my
hair before styling it to go to the gym
and then once done when I hop in the
shower after the gym it feels like I've
done a treatment on my hair so this is
just a really easy hack that you can do
to help your hair grow in your hair help
my next hacker tip is to always keep
elastics in your gym bag and I'm just
going to show you guys my two favorite
hairstyles for when going to the gym so
the first one I'm just creating a middle
part and French braiding or Dutch
braiding all the way down you can choose
whichever one you'd like to do and then
once you've done that on both sides you
just go ahead and wrap it around to the
back and secure it into a little bun so
this is just a really easy way to style
your hair for the gym that's different
and it also keeps it from the sweat
coming from beating down on your
forehead because of the braids and the
next gym hairstyles to create a really
really deep side part and then just go
ahead and twist the hair and while you
twist add more hair and then wrap it
around until the back and then just
secure it into a ponytail which is just
another really easy way to do your hair
for the gym and it's just a little bit
of a twist on the average ponytail
you
and a simple hack for keeping elastics
in your bag is to take some of the
spendable wire here and then I'm just
putting on a couple elastics and then
what I'm going to do is just secure it
into a zipper or you could secure it
into a little hook inside your gym bag
to make sure that you never lose the
elastics themselves and that they're
always ready and accessible for when you
need them my next gym hack is how to get
rid of the deodorant stains that happen
all over your shirt especially if you're
wearing black so what you're going to
want to do is just take a little bit of
nylon or some tights put them on your
hand and then just rub the deodorant
stains and that will get all of the
little white marks off of your shirt so
that you're ready to go and then my
fifth and final fitness hack is to just
take a napkin and a bit of baking soda I
took a bit of spoonful and all you want
to do is sprinkle it into the middle of
the napkin then take each corner of the
napkin and pull up and then just kind of
twist it around so that it stays secure
and then just take a little piece of
ribbon and then tie it off so that it
doesn't become unwound and then all you
have to do is just place these in your
running shoes after you're done at the
gym so that it keeps them from kind of
getting sinky so I'll just kind of leave
these in my running shoes overnight and
it keeps them smelling fresh and nice
so those were the five fitness hacks
that I had to show you guys today if you
guys want to see more fitness hacks just
thumbs up this video or let me know down
below and I'll see you guys all in a
future Fitness Friday Friday
