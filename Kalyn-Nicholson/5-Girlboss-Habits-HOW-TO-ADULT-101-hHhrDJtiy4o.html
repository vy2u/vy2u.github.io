hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel you're officially in the last
week of videos it's literally just flown
so we'll have to make the most of this
last week of videos starting with this
one for today's video I'm doing a girl
boss habits video and I have my coffee
here because even though it's not
necessarily a full-on coffee talk I need
to help me sit down and just get like
mad real and have life chats I just feel
like I always just want to have a hot
beverage for it I don't know why I made
myself pumpkin spice coffee with vegan
pumpkin spice marshmallow you know I'm
just gonna give you guys a close-up have
you ever seen something so beautiful I
like my cup you guys are following me
already be sure to check out to my
Twitter my Instagram I'll hop it up on
the screen here come during the coast
crew band posting a bunch of fall stuff
and I'm also gonna start teasing some
stuff from November now so definitely
come check that out and aside from that
if you guys would like to know the five
habits that I consider to be most
girlboss then just keep watching
grandmas habit number one is going to
bed and waking up early now this girl
boss have it might not you know include
all of you guys watching this I know
that there's some of you that might work
shift work or have to get up super late
or maybe goes to bed super late because
of work I mean take this as you will
whether or not you are somebody that
goes to bed early and also wakes up
early it's more so the matter of getting
enough sleep that's so important so for
the longest time I had myself convinced
that I could run off of six hours of
sleep and in the last like two months
it's really been apparent to me that
that is not the case which is why I did
my 10:00 p.m. and why I've been trying
to force myself to get the minimum of
seven hours of sleep I don't know why
but when I wake up earlier I feel more
motivated I get more stuff done and I
just feel like I tackled so much more in
one day so that's why I try to get up
earlier which means I have to try and
get to sleep earlier as well I now try
to go to bed around 10:30 11:00 and wake
up between 6:00 and 7:00 every single
day which gives me the optimal amount of
sleep and then on the weekends I make
sure I get eight or more I just let my
body wake up naturally if you're
wondering why I consider this to be like
one of the number one girl boss habits
it's because it is until you try and
work on no sleep that you realize how
much our bodies thrive off of it and I'm
not just talking like yeah you get tired
you get lethargic but I find that when I
don't get enough sleep even like the way
I start thinking changes and my anxiety
changes I feel so much more like
overwhelmed by things rather than
feeling
I can tackle things sleep also helps us
manage our appetite it helps us keep
from getting sick I don't know why I've
just been so obsessed to sleep lately
but it's just so it's so important for
your body it's so important for your
mind and it's so important in terms of
wanting to like slay life you have to
give your body the time to rest and
recoup to at it recently I did a full
video on how to be an early riser that
I'll pop up on the screen somewhere so
if you guys want to check that I would
definitely do and that way I don't have
to spend it too much more time
blabbering about this but tip number one
or habit number one of a girl boss is
getting enough sleep
robots habit number two is fighting
procrastination procrastination is the
devil and I feel like any of you guys
out there watching this everybody in
their life goes through pits of
self-doubt when you have or you're going
through a pit of self-doubt
procrastination just weasels its way in
and it starts to suck all the
productivity and all like the self
fulfillment out of your life I say this
because for me recently I've been a
little bit more anxious than usual and
I've been trying to kind of navigate it
but recently I've noticed the direct
correlation between what I'm feeling
anxious or what I'm feeling down about
myself I instantly look at everything
with a very failed attitude like I look
at it as if I've already failed at it
before I've even tried which makes me
push off even starting the task to begin
with this can be something as simple as
you know going to get groceries to
finishing a big project when you look at
it through a skewed perspective of
self-doubt or negativity you
procrastinate doing those things because
you're afraid that you're gonna fail or
you think you failed before you've even
begun we blow these things up to be so
big in our heads that we suddenly think
that we're not equipped we don't have
enough time it's not gonna be good
enough so we'll have to wait and push it
off for another time and that's just not
the case because anytime I forced myself
to fight that habit to fight
procrastination it ends up being so much
easier than I thought it was gonna be
and it gets done so much quicker and I
feel so much better so if you guys need
some tips on how to beat procrastination
my favorite tip that I use is I use the
timer on my phone if it's a big huge
task that I have to do like let's say
editing a really extensive video
sometimes that is just so overwhelming
to me to try and do in one day on top of
all the other things that I feel I have
to do as well then I set timers so for
one straight hour I'll put the timer on
and
for that whole hour I have to just
hunker down and edit the video and not
think or focus on anything else and once
the alarm rings and the hour is over
I'll give myself 15 minutes break to
make the calls pay the bills run to the
grocery store take Bethy oh and then I
set the hour again on my timer and do it
again it sounds weird and I don't know
why but chunking out your day with a
timer makes it so much easier to get so
much more done and you stop
procrastinating because your mind isn't
overwhelmed by all the things that's
trying to do it's like no just for this
solid hour my time and dedication is
devoted to this task and nothing else
and I can do everything else on this
timer end I don't know why but trust me
it works
give it a try and the second thing that
I use to beat procrastination is work
versus reward so for instance usually
when I procrastinate it's like oh I'm
gonna procrastinate editing this video
because I don't have enough time but
instead I'm gonna watch this episode of
friends that I've seen seven times in a
row I don't know about you guys but for
me at anytime I end up procrastinating
the thing that I'm using to
procrastinate with whether it be food TV
lounging around doing nothing sitting on
my phone I feel like I can't fully enjoy
it because I know that there's something
else I should be doing so instead I
forced myself to do the work to get the
reward so for instance if there's a new
episode of a show I want to watch if
there's something I want to do I at
least force myself to do a one-hour
chunk timer on getting that thing done
before I reward myself with something ie
you know a burrito or a rerun episode of
friends not only does this work but it
just makes the reward part more
enjoyable like I can sit down and watch
Halloweentown and actually enjoy it
knowing all my videos are edited versus
watching it and in the back of my mind
is this little anxious like feeling like
I should be doing something else because
rather than watching Harry Ron and
Hermione fight Baltimore robots habit
number three is loving to learn or
seeing anything in life as a chance to
learn now this is totally a perspective
and it's a perspective that absolutely
everyone on this earth can have it's
just a choice of whether or not you
choose to look at things that way
whether you are in school or you're not
every single day we have so many
opportunities to learn something as if
we are still students we are greeted at
almost every moment with a chance to
learn and experience something new and
gain more knowledge from that experience
everything up from learning how to
coupon so you say
groceries learning how to change a tire
when it goes flat on the side of the
road or learning a new language being a
girl boss is looking at it as this is an
experience to learn more and gain more
knowledge in life rather than that seems
too daunting this is such a negative
experience in my life
or I don't have time for that and this
especially comes in handy when you know
life tends to come around and kick you
on your butt every now and then whether
it be a flat tire or you get into a
fender bender or you have to pay your
taxes like whatever it is instead of
looking at it as a negative experience
you look at it as a challenge and a
chance to learn more and gain more
knowledge I think if we forever stay
students then everything in life instead
of being positive and negative it's all
just experience girlboss habit number
four learning how to prioritize and
balance your life I feel like when you
hear the term girlboss nowadays just
such a common term now thank you to
sophia ever so do you think success you
think business you think money you think
going out there taking charge of life
and yes of course success is amazing and
work is important but I also think that
being a girl boss is knowing when to
prioritize things over your success or
over work I was actually talking about
this with my sister recently where I
feel like the reason why we're starting
to see our generation become so
disconnected and so sad is because back
in the day like I think even when my
parents were having kids
it wasn't about landing your dream job
not that there's anything wrong with
wanting to land your dream job but it
was more so about making a mean so that
you could be connected with the people
that mattered most to you and I feel
like what's changed from that generation
to our generation is that we're seeing
so many more entrepreneurs nowaday we're
seeing so many more people going out
there chasing their dreams traveling the
world and living their best life and
that's amazing but I think something
that we all need to also promote and
never forget is to put family friends
and your community above work and
success and now I'm not sure everyone's
gonna agree with me on that one but I
just know personally that when I decided
that I wanted to take on YouTube full
term I was so like constantly working
and not that I was doing it for any sort
of like big momentum or gain it was just
naturally because I loved doing it I had
passion for it and so I followed that
passion and that passion led me to you
exactly what you're seeing right now I
think along the way I wish I had chosen
you know put down work for a night or
two and hang out with my family more but
a little bit more time with my friends
or living with my friends before going
off and living on my own those are like
honest-to-god truths that I feel they
think that it's also important to
prioritize and to balance your life and
know that it's not all about success
it's not all about having this dream
life or this dream world because what
success actually equates to is happiness
and if you really truly think about it
the things that bring you the most sense
of happiness are love joy and connection
with other people so being a girl boss
means knowing when to prioritize your
friends and your family people that
matter most to you over yourself or your
success and finding that balance in life
between you know giving yourself time
putting all your thoughts and efforts
into your passion but also giving a
little piece of your time and yourself
to the people that you love and care
about the most
because without being corny at the end
of the day I think that that's what
matters most I got some a marshmallow
doughnut sip oh my god and last but not
least girl boss habit number five is
knowing that you're not perfect but
self-correcting anyways when you go
through life with the perspective of
mistakes actually just being lessons
then you stop putting so much pressure
on yourself and you stop being so hard
on yourself for all the times that you
aren't necessarily right I know from
reading your guys comments and from past
coffee talk videos that I think
something that we all might maybe have
in common is this little bit of
self-doubt that tends to you know sit
inside of our heads and make us feel
kind of crappy about ourselves and I
feel like fighting that little piece
inside your brain that wants to eat
yourself alive every time you embarrass
yourself beat yourself down for every
time that you fail I think fighting that
voice is honestly one of the hardest
things that we will do in our lifetime
so when we shift our perspectives from
why did I do this to what did I learn
from this it takes so much of the
pressure off I remember when I was
reading you are about asked by Jensen
Shara one of the biggest things that I
still use in my mind to this day any
time I'm feeling so overwhelmed and so
much pressure to be perfect is I just
want to see if I can do it so for you
togar for instance there are so many
nights where I filmed three videos and
they were completely
focus or I was afraid that the videos
weren't gonna be good enough or whatever
it was instead of feeling all of that
pressure to make this series perfect I
wonder if I could refilm those three
videos in the next you know two hours
before I lose the daylight and that way
whether you can do it or you can't do it
it was just a wondering if you could so
it takes the pressure off and we stop
holding ourselves to these ridiculous
standards and telling ourselves that
were failures when we don't meet them
which also works for mistakes you know
when you do something wrong when you
bite off someone's head because you're
in a bad mood or you say something that
maybe offended somebody you completely
fell off your workout routine and have
been eating pizza every day whatever it
is being a girl boss isn't beating
yourself up for it it's self-correcting
and just trying to do better next time
and while being a girl boss means being
determined I think it also just means
enjoying the present moment and
understanding that you're trying your
best just like everybody else on this
planet and so there you have it those
are my five top girl boss habits or
perspectives if you guys want to add a
girl boss habit definitely be sure to
leave it down below I love the comments
section of videos like this because
everybody's just so warm and welcoming
and supportive and it aside from that I
love you guys to the moon back I hope
you guys enjoyed today's in you tuber
video and I'm gonna go eat more
marshmallows and make more coffee bye
guys
