Oh
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video it's the
25th day of you Tober and i'm gonna be
sharing with you guys some of my
hairstyles that I've been rocking lately
as well as a few new ones for the fall
time I used to do hairstyle videos like
all the time when I first started my
channel and just recently I started
seeing you guys request them more so I
figured why not throw some of the hair
cells that I've been playing around with
lately into one big video since I know
it's been something you guys have been
asking for for quite some time now
really quick if you guys aren't
following me already be sure to check
out my Twitter my Instagram I'm gonna
pop them up on the screen here and also
subscribe if you guys are new to my
channel right now I'm posting a new
video every single day for the whole
month of October so definitely be sure
to join our family if you haven't
already or hit the notification bell so
you guys know whenever a video goes live
and other than that if you guys want to
see you five different hairstyles that
I've been playing around with for the
fall time then just keep watching PS I'm
like very aware of how badly I need to
get my roots done in this video I have
to wait another week so just bear with
me
so since I'm doing this on second day
hair I started by putting some dry
shampoo in and for the first hairstyle
this is going to be the braids that I
was wearing in one of my Beetlejuice
like inspired photos on Instagram you
guys are asking for a tutorial on it so
I just start by taking a section from
the top of my head being sure to leave
some pieces to frame my face in the
front and then I Dutch French braids so
instead of turning your braids inward
you'll notice that I braid outward and
add pieces as you go this makes the
braid sit on top of your head rather
than within your hair if that makes any
sense and then I just leave a good few
inches of hair at the bottom then put a
clear elastic in it and pull on the
braid to create volume so this just
makes your braids look you know big and
voluminous and I find just leaving a
little bit of hair at the bottom kind of
adds like a cute little touch to it
and then of course you're gonna want to
go ahead and do the exact same thing to
the other side if you guys are confused
by what I meant by French Dutch braiding
basically just reverse the way that you
normally braid and that's how you create
the braid to sit on top of your head and
that's it that's all you have to do for
these little rope rates
so my second favorite go-to hairstyle
lately has been just creating this
little headband within my hair so all I
do is take a chunk of hair underneath
the top layer twist it towards the front
of my face and bring it over to the
other side at the same time and then
bobby pin it underneath the top layer of
hair and then take a chunk on that side
and do the exact same thing pulling it
over to the other side this is such a
simple easy hairstyle to do but it adds
a little touch too just like your
everyday especially for second day hair
or you know if you have like curled hair
I just find this look super cute
so my go-to hairstyle whenever the top
layer of my hair seems to be struggling
the most but I want to push showering or
washing my hair to that night I'll just
take a top section of each side of my
head again leaving out pieces to frame
my face and then combine them or if
you're wanting to you could turn these
into two separate buns but I just
combined them at the top of my head
brush it back call my fingers through
and then create a messy bun on the top
of my head and I just find that this is
super cute again for a second day hair
but also with the pieces out framing the
face I just feel like I don't know it
just looks so cute with like all fall
outfits
my other favorite thing to do when I
have second day hair is usually to just
honestly throw a hat on so just to spice
up a hairstyle for when you're putting
on a hat I take a section underneath the
top section of my hair and I just like
to fishtail it if you guys don't know
how to fishtail you basically just take
a small chunk from one side cross it
over and add it to the other and then do
the exact same thing creating an X and
then just do that with small chunks all
the way down the hair is just like a
little touch-up on a braid and then just
to add a little bit more you know
dimension to it I decided to take one of
those little chalk like hair chalks in
the color pink and just chalk it pink
just to so it stands out amongst the
rest of my hair
and then the last and final hairstyle
and personally my favorite I like to
take a chunk of hair again underneath
the top layer of hair but instead of
twisting it over and to the other side I
twist it back word and towards the back
of my head and then bobby pin it under a
section of hair and then do the exact
same thing to the other side I find this
looks especially good with curled hair I
don't know why but it just reminds me of
just like princess hair I don't know but
it's my favorite hairstyle to be rocking
lately and you've probably seen it a lot
so that is it for today's video I hope
you guys enjoyed it leave a comment down
below letting me know your favorite
hairstyle and if you guys decide to
recreate any of them as always be sure
