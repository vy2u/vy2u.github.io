it tomorrow and now you know my plate is
a little bit more clear to do what I
want to do today and then you end up
just watching Vampire Diaries and then
you wake up the next day and then you're
like oh I still have to do this maybe
I'll push it off one more day then you
watch more Vampire Diaries then all the
sudden a weeks gone by and yet you've
made it through three seasons of the
show but you got nothing else done
alright we see we're vacuuming again hey
guys and welcome back to my channel for
today's video we're going to be talking
all about procrastination and honestly
it's probably a good thing because it's
been a recent goal of mine to really
push myself to stop procrastinating
things so much and so I'm going to share
with you guys the five tips that I have
been using lately to kind of help push
myself to not procrastinate anymore and
yeah if you guys aren't following me
already I'm going to leave my Twitter
and my Instagram right here on the
screen and other than that let's jump
into the video because why procrastinate
it any longer so tip number one is to
make it to do list and this is like a
very obvious one but I swear that
writing things down sorry I'm still
getting over being sick so my throats
gonna go in and out a little bit through
this video first of all it gets an out
of your head and so you don't feel so
scatterbrained and having it written
down in front of you like physically
right there right in front of you now
you know what you're trying to achieve
now you know what you need to get done
and so you can go task by task and check
things off which is also a very
gratifying feeling don't overwhelm
yourself don't stress yourself out
thinking of all of the million things
you need to get done just write it down
and then once you've written it down
don't think about it again until you're
on that task tip number two is to break
the tasks down into smaller tasks so
things like a project you can break it
down into okay well I need to come up
with a thesis I need to write this I
need to research this those are all
smaller tasks rather than just getting a
project done not only does this make it
easier to prioritize what needs to be
done now and what can wait to be done a
little bit later this also makes each
and every task seems so much less
daunting and so much more achievable and
manageable so when you break everything
down into a smaller task it's going to
seem a like okay I could probably do
that in the next 15 minutes versus this
is going to take me a week to finish tip
number three and this is the
absolute most helpful thing that I have
ever used and it's to just start don't
think just do it we back with the vacuum
again really a lot of the times starting
is the hardest part because we blow up
all of these things that we feel we need
to do in our heads to seem so
overbearing and so that's usually the
block that stops us from starting and a
lot of the times once you start you
gained a bit of momentum and you get
over that first hump of just getting
there and starting and then all of a
sudden you feel like okay this is
actually a lot easier than I thought it
was going to be and then you finish it
then you're on to the next one
don't think about it just do it just get
it done don't think about it at all
and don't focus on what you think it's
gonna be like or how terrible you think
it's gonna be and just just start just
do it I know it sounds kind of silly and
stupid to have a countdown with yourself
but if you always promise yourself that
at the count of three you're always just
gonna do it you're like three two one
and then you just do it you don't think
you just do tip number four is to be
easy on yourself a lot of the times we
get really down and really hard on
ourselves especially if we've been
procrastinating a lot of things and not
getting that much done then we feel
shame we feel guilt which then pushes us
to procrastinate things even longer
because when you don't feel good about
yourself you don't want to do anything
there's a spotty a book I'm listening to
you right now called rewire I'll pop it
up on the screen here or put it down
below but it's all about retraining your
brain to think more positively and to be
less hard on yourself because when we're
hard on ourselves and we're constantly
beating ourselves down how are we
supposed to get anything done when you
have this pessimistic voice inside your
head telling you that you're going to
fail or it's not going to be good enough
you have to rewire your brain to be easy
on yourself and to think no no I can get
this done and it is going to be kick-ass
be a support system inside your head
rather than to be a worrywart you know
what I mean just constantly worrying
about everything and being pessimistic
and thinking it's going to suck and
thinking that we set for putting it off
and that were bad people it's just a
really bad spiral to go down and then
you end up procrastinating things even
longer and then you end up feeling stuck
in your life so you need to rewire your
brain to be easy on yourself and to be
caring and supportive of yourself and if
you're trying to do that and you're
really struggling then I highly
recommend reading that book because it's
all about how your subconscious
sometimes isn't aligned with your
conscious so your conscious brain might
be trying to be positive your
subconscious might have some really
false beliefs about yourself that you're
about
person or that you don't deserve success
or you're not going to be good enough
and so you really have to be easy on
yourself you have to be kind yourself or
else how the hell are you supposed to
get anything done and the last and final
tip is tip number five and it's to ask
yourself why you want to do it if you
were really struggling to do something
you keep pushing off you keep
procrastinating yourself ask yourself
why is it on my to-do list is there a
reason if it's a big project that you
just don't feel like doing or if it's to
write a book or if it's to clean your
apartment what are you gaining from it
because odds are if it's on your to-do
list it's supposed to get you further on
in life so that project might not be a
fun one but it's going to give you the
grade which is going to help you further
on in your program or whatever you're
studying which is then going to push you
into the life that you're trying to live
or the career that you're trying to get
if it's to just clean your apartment I
have a clean environment I have a way
better headspace and I just like having
my apartment clean so I know that it's
going to put me in a better mood and
it's going to make me more productive if
my surroundings are clean so if it's to
pay bills or if it's to you know just
whatever it is try and ask yourself why
do I need to do this why is it on my
to-do list because a lot of the times
when you come up with a reason why it
gives you that fire or that force to
kind of be like okay this is why I'm
doing it and this is why it needs to be
done now and try not to hold yourself to
unrealistic expectations or feeling like
you have to be perfect either guys a lot
of the times with procrastination we
think that it's either not going to be
good enough or not it won't be perfect
or the way that we want it to be in our
heads or we've decided that we're
already going to fail before we've even
started so why start now so don't hold
yourself to unrealistic expectations
don't feel like it needs to be perfect
just do it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you guys have any tips to
add be sure to leave them down below and
I'm going to challenge you guys that at
the end of this video to turn off your
computer and go do all the things you
need to do unless it unless what you
need to do is on your computer if you
just needed someone to tell you then
take this as your sign I'm telling you
to just go do it just go get one thing
done on your to-do list and you'll feel
so much better you'll gain that momentum
and then all of a sudden you're gonna
want to do so many more things
I'm not kidding when I say the last
month has actually been so productive
and especially in contrast to how
productive I was being prior to
implementing these tips into my life I
don't know
you feel good it makes you feel like you
are being successful and you are pushing
yourself and bettering yourself every
day and so it's not going to be this
easy every day but when you pick up
these habits to not procrastinate after
a while it's just going to be something
that's kind of second nature to you and
yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I love you guys to the absolute
moon and back and I'll see you guys all
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
