sorry I haven't done a Fitness Friday
and a little bit um I just got really
behind on one of them and then the
second one I couldn't think of anything
in the world to do so I didn't want to
make like a really dumb Fitness Friday
and you guys don't even enjoy it so I
just decided to take like two fitness
Friday's off to like regain some ideas
of what I could do sorry my windows open
so you can probably hear some cars so
for today for Fitness Friday I'm going
to show you five different ways you can
work out in your daily routine without
really having to you know the change
into your workout gear or break that
much of a sweat they're just five simple
things you can do during your every
single day routine and you really don't
have to change you're not actually full
at working out so in all reality they're
just fun little ways to tone up without
even realize you're doing it and if
you're doing these things almost in
every single day eventually you're going
to start to see some fun results from it
so I'm going to now share with you what
those things are so keep watching so the
first thing is after you wake up in the
morning one of the first things we tend
to do is brush our teeth now for that
two minutes usually is what it is that
you are sitting there brushing your
teeth it is kind of standing brushing
your teeth doing the same old thing well
why not use that to good use and do a
wall sit while you brush your teeth so
your end up doing a while sit for about
one to two minutes twice a day which
eventually is going to show some really
good results and it's going to build up
your wall set endurance which is really
good number two is while reading a
magazine or a book how about for every
two pages you do a plank while reading
and then two pages you go down and you
continue reading two more pages you get
up and you onto a plank and you read and
two more pages you're down on the floor
while reading this is just going to work
your abs in your core and it actually
works your legs and your arms too but
especially your core and you're not
going to even really notice that you're
doing a plank for so long because you'll
be so into whatever it is you're reading
so I highly recommend you pick a good
book for this one but it's a quick and
easy way to work out during your
everyday routine number three is while
listening to your favorite song put on
whatever your favorite song is do squats
for the entire song put on whatever your
favorite song is at the time it could be
from 5sos it could be from one direction
it could be from Ron Pope it could be
from Andrew Bell it could be from Luke
Bryan it could
from anybody in the world any genre in
the world throw on your favorite song
and for the entire song just do a quick
little squat session for the entire song
and it's going to be kind of fun because
you're listening to your favorite song
and then you just got a quick little
squat challenge out of the way for the
day
number four is while putting something
in the microwave or the oven or if
you're waiting for something in the
blender or for your coffee to brew do
some quick counter push-ups so what it
is is you just lean on an angle with
your hands on your counter and do normal
push-ups as you normally would for the
entire time that you are waiting I can
les something's in the oven then I
highly suggest you just do it for like I
don't know the last two minutes of one
is something's in the oven but you just
lean against the counter and do some
quick counter push-ups and lastly number
five when walking towards something in
your house if you're going from your
bedroom to the washroom or from your
kitchen to your living room lunges the
whole way I know that sounds stupid but
even if you just do it a couple times a
day it's really going to work your legs
and your bum in your core and all you
got to do is hold put your hands I like
to put my hands on my hips and then you
basically for each step you take take a
big giant step and squat almost touching
your knee to the ground and then lift up
and take your next step and do another
lunge again and do it for the entire way
till you get to your destination and do
that maybe like two or three times
around your house you're going to look a
little silly but it's a quick and easy
way to get a little bit of target tone
and a little bit of working out in
without really actually having to work
out so I hope you guys enjoyed these
five little ways that you can work out
within your daily routine if you guys
tend to do these every single day for a
long duration of time and you keep
building up endurance and you just keep
doing them and it's really going to pay
off in the longer and you're just
getting a little bit of an extra workout
in without even really having to work
out I mean you are doing the moves but
you're not fully changing and sweating
and all that fun stuff so I hope you
guys enjoyed this Fitness Friday let me
know down below which one was your
favorite and if you think of one be sure
to comment it down below too and I'll be
sure to thumbs it up and comment on it
if I enjoyed it or if I decide to try it
out myself so I will see you guys on a
future video and thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
