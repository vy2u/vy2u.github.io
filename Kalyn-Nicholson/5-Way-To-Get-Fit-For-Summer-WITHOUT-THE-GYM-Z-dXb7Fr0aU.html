hey guys and welcome back to Fitness
Friday I haven't done like an actual
cut-and-dry Fitness Friday and so long
so I decided that I was going to do one
this week don't mind my appearance right
now I've literally been running around
filming this like a madwoman all day
so I thought it would be a really good
idea with the hot summer months on their
way and the nice weather to show you
guys a bunch of different ways that you
can work out without needing a gym
membership now that school's over or
just in general the nicer weather is
around we really don't need to be going
indoors to be working out not only can
this save a lot of money but it also
just gets you outside and breathing in
the fresh air which is always really
good for your soul so you guys want to
see five ways to get fit this summer
without the use of a gym then just keep
watching and that would be my dinner I'm
gonna go eat because I am Allah hungry
so my absolute favorite and most common
way of exercising is running and I
always get asked what app I use and it
is run keeper I'm not being sponsored
it's just my favorite app because it
tracks how far I run and how fast I run
and all of that fun stuff so I like to
run around outside or on trails or on
like the track at a local high school or
anything like that but you could also
just run around your neighborhood or if
you want something that's a little bit
less you know intense you can always go
for hikes with a friend find some cool
hikes around where you live or just go
on hikes around buy your own and track
how far you went
so another new favorite of mine and it
is killer for your legs and your butt is
two two sets of stairs now you could do
this indoors or outdoors super easy and
every fifth set I always skip to two
stairs at a time and it's just really
fun and really cheap and I'm pretty sure
everybody could find a set of stairs
somewhere and again this is another
thing that you could do either indoors
or outdoors but bodyweight exercises are
amazing for toning and you could do all
different types just google anything
that you want to work on and I will pick
like arms abs butt back anything like
that so if you guys want like a full
video and detail of a bunch of
bodyweight exercises that I like to do I
can definitely do that but again you can
do this outdoors out of track at a field
or even just in your backyard
in another really smart way you can skip
the gym is to go to a jungle gym instead
and use the bars to do things like
pull-ups or just anything that you can
think of like using the jungle gym to
your advantage and just get some like
squats in and a bunch of stuff like that
and this is just super fun and a bit a
different way of working out as opposed
to just doing bodyweight stuff on the
ground
and last but not least this is something
you could do indoors or out or outdoors
but doing just some yoga at home I like
to do the yoga with Adriene I will leave
a link to her YouTube down below her
YouTube videos are my favorite or I'll
just do some stretches on my own but
again this is something that you could
so easily do on a towel outside or just
in your room or anything like that and
it costs absolutely nothing and yoga is
one of my favorite ways of exercising as
well so those are my five different ways
of exercising without the gym for the
summertime I hope you guys enjoyed if
you guys can think of any more leave
them down below and I will see you guys
all in my next video bye guys stare
