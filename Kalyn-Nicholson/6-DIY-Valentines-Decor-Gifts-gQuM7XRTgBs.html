to be showing you DIY Valentine's Day
decor and two little gifts so for
starting out I'm gonna show you guys how
to make these cute little Rose phases so
I'm starting off with some fake flowers
and some styrofoam balls so I'm just
taking the balls and taking the flowers
and just kind of shoving them inside the
Styrofoam ball to keep them in place now
if yours aren't staying in place you can
glue or hot glue them but mines tend to
stick so I didn't have to do that so I'm
just going all the way around the
perimeter of the Styrofoam ball and
sticking all the flowers in you could do
red flowers pink flowers white flowers
or any type you want and I'm using just
this thin base or you could use a candle
holder it's totally up to you and I'm
just hot gluing around the perimeter of
the outside and then gluing the little
flower ball into place and that is all
you have to do for this cute little vaz
that looks like there's little flowers
coming at the top and we ended up
placing these on our fireplace and they
were so pretty now my next DIY is simple
and easy and really cute to do for a
special someone so all you're gonna need
is a deck of cards some paper a hole
punch some scissors some sharpies as
well as some ribbon and some craft glue
so I'm going ahead and I'm just grabbing
a deck of cards and I'm going to be
creating two holes on the top and bottom
of the cards so you might want to do
this in in separate chunks so I'm just
taking one two two cards at a time hole
punching them and then using another
card to be the guide as to where to put
the hole punches on the next card so
this shows a little bit more
time-consuming but once you're done it's
going to make a cute little booklet I
don't know why I'm drawn to you could
you be the other ones
I'm then cutting just some white paper
into small squares that will fit on the
cards and then on each little paper I'm
going to write a reason why you love
your significant other and then I'm
using obviously a card piece to on the
front to write 52 reasons why I love you
so it's just a cute little booklet you
can give it to your girlfriend or
boyfriend that has 52 reasons why you
love them and this is very inexpensive
and very easy to do
I will love you I love you I love you I
don't need those things I don't need no
I don't need and to attach the booklet
together I'm just going to be using
ribbon through the hole punches that we
made but you could also use like little
rings from a binder or anything you'd
like to secure the booklet into place
we use I can see me now this next DIY is
this love decor piece so all I did was
grab a small canvas from the dollar
store and I'm just going to be using
some sponge brush sets a little bit of
glue some normal glue some paint sorry
and some glitter and now you can do this
with any color scheme you want but what
I'm doing is I'm taking some tape and
creating just lines or stripes all the
way up the canvas I'm then just taking
the black paint but you could do this
with any color you want and you could
match it to the color scheme of your
room if you have a purple room or a pink
room you could do any colors you'd like
but I decided to go with black and then
once dry just go ahead and remove all of
the tape and you have a little stripe to
canvas I'm then going to be using some
foam cord to carve out some letters
again you could do whatever word you
wanted but I decided to go with love
since it is Valentine's Day themed so
I'm just tracing out the word love now
you could do this with actual tracers
but I decided to freehand it and then
I'm just using an exacto knife or just a
small one to cut out the foam core
and then just taking some craft glue and
then one of the little sponge brushes
and brushing it all over the letter and
then taking glitter again you can use
any color glitter of your choice but I
decided to go with gold and I'm just
sprinkling it on top so that the whole
letter is covered in glitter and doing
this on every single letter
and then just going to place them on my
canvas where I'd like them to be and
then using a hot glue gun I'm going to
secure them into place
once then you have this cute little
canvas that displays something
Valentine's Day themed of your choice so
for my next DIY this is a really really
cute and inexpensive way again to give
somebody a gift so you're gonna need
tape sharpies and all different types of
treats and gum and candies of your
choice
so take the sharpie and write a little
Valentine's Day letter to whoever you
are giving it to it could be a friend
boyfriend/girlfriend and then using the
names on top of all of the candies
you've chosen create little bunny ways
to write a little letter to them using
the chocolate bar so for instance the
first line of mine was you hold the
Reese's Pieces to my heart when I found
you I scored you shot an arrow through
my heart and so on and so forth so this
is just a really easy way to write a
cute little letter and it's very
inexpensive if you don't have enough
that much money to be spending on gifts
this year
so my next DIY is this Hart wreath that
you could have displayed in your room or
on your door so again all you're gonna
want to do is get some foam core and
just trace out a heart or any shape
you'd really want but I decided to go
with a heart again this is Valentine's
Day theme and then I'm just using the
small exacto knife to just carve out the
foam core as well you could try doing
this on bristol board if you don't have
any foam core I'm just not sure how easy
it'll hold up
so once done I'm just cutting red tissue
paper into small little squares but you
could do white pink red or just a
mixture of all the colors if you really
wanted to make it look fancy and then
just using a bit of craft glue I'm
taking these small squares and wrapping
it around the end of a pencil dipping it
in the glue and then putting it on to
the heart and you're just gonna keep
doing this over and over again until you
fill the entire heart with little tissue
papers
to finish it off I'm just securing a
ribbon onto the very top so I'm able to
hang it up and that is all you have to
do for this cute little heart wreath
that you can hang either in your bedroom
on your door or anywhere else you'd like
to display it now this last DIY could be
the eyes decor piece or it could be a
gift on doing is I'm taking this glass
phase that I got from the dollar store
and a hot glue gun and I'm just using
the hot glue gun to write a word on the
phase you could write love you could
write the name of the somebody you want
to give it to you could write anything
you want you can even write a whole
letter on there if you'd really like to
and then I'm just using some matte
chalkboard paint to spray paint over the
phase and then you're done you could
spray paint it black white pink red any
color you want and then display some
roses or flowers in it and that is all
you have to do so those were my six
little Valentine's Day DIY decor and
gifts I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys on a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
