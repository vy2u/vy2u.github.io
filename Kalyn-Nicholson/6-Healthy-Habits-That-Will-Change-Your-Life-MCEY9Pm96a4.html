park right outside of my building and I
get to face it all day while I work it's
the best thing ever but anyways here
little Bobby's parking that's why hey
guys and welcome back to my channel for
today's video
it isn't so on this video and totally
owed you guys this video from the week
that I was moving and I didn't get a
video up that week and then I supposed
to do a bonus video the following week
anyway I don't know why I'm explaining
this you guys but I decided to drop in
to surprise you guys so this video for
today video I'm going to be doing one of
the many videos in the January theme and
it is going to be six healthy habits
before successful people six times you
should do if you just want to be you
know more productive and happy and
organized if you guys aren't following
me already I'll top my Twitter my screen
right here on the screen definitely come
check it out and of that if you guys
want to know the six healthy habits to
change your life and just keep watching
okay so the first data is getting up
earlier which is so I know over said
over done but this tip will change your
life even if you have work early in your
force' gap trying to even a bit earlier
than that so you can get more done
within your day it is ridiculous the
things that we can get done when we know
that there's something else we have to
do aka if you know you of school you
know you have works you know I got all
these other things if you get up and you
get like one to two things done before
you even go to school or work or
whatever it is you do it sets the tone
for the rest of your day to be so much
more productive and you'll be in a way
better mood so set your alarm a little
bit earlier so when your body gets into
the routine of waking up early it just
becomes an easier thing to do if you
struggle with getting up in the morning
I have a few tips for you guys because
definitely in the winter months I find I
struggle with it more because it's so
dark when I'm trying to get up few tips
that I've learned is one to put my phone
on the other side of the room and on
full-blast and to not allow snooze on my
alarm actually gives you the option to
turn snooze off and if I know that I
can't hit snooze because there is no
snooze I'll see more force to get up
because there's no other alarm that's
going to wake me up
prepare for your warning in advance the
night before set out what you're going
to wear so your workout clothes if you
plan on working out in the morning make
your lunch kind of get you put your mug
out by your
machine just have everything I don't
know if that's just like a super nerdy
thing that I like to do but when I have
everything planned and ready to go by
the time I go to bed it'll look makes me
excited to wake up in the morning
because I've already started off so
organized having a morning routine it
just kind of gives me something to look
forward to in the morning you know I
have my like the way I go about doing
things making my coffee making a
smoothie and it makes me so excited to
get up in the morning and it's just
super beneficial so I highly recommend
doing that these second habit that will
change your life is to prep your meals
this will change your life even if
you're not doing it for the sake of
getting healthier if you're you want to
save money if you want to stop eating so
much junk if you want to feel better and
not only that makes eating crappy or
foods or like going out for food more of
like a treat definitely start meal
prepping your food I'm going to let you
know what's actually going into your
body be it's going to give you more
control and also it's going to make it
so that you're not so lazy and then you
know order up food or just make
something really crappy and fast every
time I go to these groceries I'll write
it like a meal cap and I do meal prep on
Sundays and Thursdays I'm not though
what meals and what snacks I'm going to
have and it makes my grocery list nice
and easy that way I'm not overspending
or over buying I can budget what I'm
trying to go for it keeps me eating so
healthy this is like one thing that is
doing this is when I saw the most change
in my body I've been doing other pretty
relatively consistent with working out I
would say at least in 2016 and I didn't
actually start seeing changes to my body
until I started meal prepping and
circuit training honestly guys meal prep
is will change your life
the expired habit I have to change your
life is to start reading more and I know
that's very generic reading it actually
makes such a difference on the way we
are the way we speak it doesn't even
have to be nonfiction you can read
whatever floats your boat but I find
just forcing myself to do two chapters
every other day it keeps us on I'm not
constantly forcing myself to read every
single day and getting bored with it
right now I'm reading read clean and
even though it's like a teen fiction
just going through the storyline in your
head if you're reading nonfiction like
you are a badass or the solo art of not
giving us up books like that reading two
chapters every other day or going to
expand your knowledge is going to expand
your vocabulary it's going to get your
mind
the gutter all the time and I was just
like what's in front of us and what's
going on our lives all the time and it
also constantly keeps your brain working
it's kind of like an exercise for your
brain and if you don't like to read
physical books and you struggle
concentrating hi I am the exact same way
and what I recommend is honestly get
audio book because even when I know it's
a day that I want to get two chapters in
but I'm not in the mood to sit down and
open up physical book top and headphones
in or just play it out loud while I'm
cleaning or doing dishes or making my
meal preps and it gets my two chapters
out of the way and come well it's such a
refreshing and just good thing to do is
just a really good habit to do the
fourth habit that is going to change
your life is budgeting your meat or your
month this is so easy to do you just map
out how much money you have incoming and
then what are your necessities aka like
rent bill your insurance anything like
that so map that out and then whatever
you have left but disaster the rest of
the month will for the week so if you
give yourself like a hundred dollars of
spending money every single week that
could include your groceries if you have
a little bit of extra money you could go
to a movie if you can budget in
something that you're trying to save up
for whether it be like a nice camera or
a new card when you start realizing
where all of your money is being spent
is it's crazy it's blew me away
the amount of money that I spent last
year on food disgusted me to my cores
the amount of money I spent on Starbucks
disgusted me to my course giving myself
a budget and then mapping it out weekly
and monthly and then also it kind of
makes it a little fun because if I save
a little bit more than I was expecting I
can spend it on like a candle or
something I just really want to do that
week or something that's like a little
bit of a treat for myself a huge tip
that I recommend with doing this is I do
all of my budgeting in my planner so
I'll do it on my monthly spreadsheet
which I actually learned my sister was
showing me that she does that so now I
don't know how to doing it and then if I
know if there's any expenses coming like
trips and things
I'll budget out a chunk of money for
those and put it in the calendar and
then by the end of the month writing
down how much I should still have in my
account for savings writing down those
totals and doing you out a monthly
spreadsheet makes it a visual thing for
you life
changing does have it to pick up that
will actually change your life and it's
such a simple one again is just walking
more go for more walks whether the
erector neighborhood your city if you're
traveling first of all is getting the
fresh air is so good for us that we
don't even realize it like we stay
inside so much that we forget to get
fresh air even if you don't have a dog
throw in some headphones and just go for
a stroll around your neighborhood you
have a corner store or a grocery store
close enough to you to walk instead of
driving this is ten fifteen minute walk
do that this is kind of what I started
doing in terms of my own sense of
meditation I shoveled sitting down and
meditating sometimes and just trying to
focus so I find when I walk that's when
I get to think and work through things
that I'm going through hop my headphones
in I'll take that leap will walk around
for fifteen twenty thirty minutes and
it's such an added bonus that it keeps
you active even if you don't have time
to work out through the weeks going on
walks is a good workout as long as
you're doing it consistently such a
simple habit to have and a simple have
it to make but it will change your life
and then my last and final habits change
alike is pick one day a week that you
get your together I honestly didn't
have it is something I've been doing for
so long every single week to pick one
day be whatever day works for you
Mondays Saturdays Sundays and just have
that day to get your together
because that will keep you on top of
everything on a weekly basis looking
yourself in for getting like lapses or
taking care of like your nails and your
hair and like you know washing your
makeup brushes cleaning your apartment
taking out the garbage meal prepping
planning out your groceries budgeting
your week planning out your weeks in
your day planner all of these things are
things that I plan on Sundays Sunday I
get my actual together I take like
a nice hot bath or a hot shower I do a
deep conditioner in my hair I do a face
mask it keeps me on top of everything it
keeps me on top of my hygiene keeps me
on top of keeping my surroundings clean
not only that it's just like a such a
nice way to end the week and start
Monday so fresh getting tasks done that
you've been procrastinating like
cleaning your closet or watching your
dog just do those things planned
one day every single week where you just
get all of the stuff that you need to
get done done guys in four by six
healthy success will have it to change
your life I hope you guys enjoyed let me
