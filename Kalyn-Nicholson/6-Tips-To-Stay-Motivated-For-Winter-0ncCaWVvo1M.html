but it is like seriously a blizzard
outside so this is like the perfect day
for me to be filming this video hey guys
and welcome back to my channel for
today's 12 days of Christmas I wanted to
do a coffee talk with you guys since
it's been a while since I've filmed one
for today's coffee talk I want to talk
about something that not only affects me
but I know based on what you guys have
been like messaging me tweeting me and
all of that fun stuff that it affects
you guys too and that is the winter
blues so this can range anywhere from
having seasonal depression to sometimes
all of us just get a little bit more
like sluggish and rundown during the
winter months because you know it's
darker longer the days are shorter it's
cold outside and you guys kind of get
the drills so long story short I'm going
to share with you guys six tips that I
have kind of come up with that I know
helped me during the winter months
stay out of like that depressive or that
sluggish state and that can hopefully
help you guys as well as always if you
guys aren't following me already I'm
going to leave my Twitter my Instagram
right here on the screen and I'm
currently doing the 12 days of Christmas
where there is a video every single day
until Christmas time so if you guys
aren't part of the family already then
be sure to subscribe and for those of
you guys that already are welcome back
let's jump into the video shall we first
things first and this is something that
is so obvious so over said and so
overdone but it needs to be said because
it is one of the number one things that
helps me and it's also just one of the
most important out of all of these tips
and it is to stay active stay moving
stay like just make sure that you're
continuously still staying active
throughout the winter months it's almost
even more important than doing so in the
summertime because it will make such a
big difference on your mood it releases
endorphins that actually makes you
happier so whether it's going to the gym
running on the treadmill even just twice
a week or you could do circuit training
at home there's so many workout videos
now on YouTube that are completely free
and it's going to also make sure that
you have a rockin body by the time
summer rolls back around you know
so we can't complain find something that
works for you that keeps you active that
keeps you moving and it's going to keep
your endorphins high and it's just gonna
make you feel better just trust me on
this one which kind of leads me into tip
number two and that is eat healthy the
thing about eating junk is you're gonna
feel like junk and this is just as true
if not more true again in the winter
time
of course since it's winter it's so much
easier for us to want to just like blow
off eating healthy and you know eat all
the junk that we want order all the food
that we want because we don't feel like
cooking or we don't feel like going out
in the blizzarding snow to get groceries
and all of that I'm not saying you can't
eat your Christmas chocolate I'm not
saying any of that kind of keep those
things to like Friday night so keep
those things for special occasion King
sure that you're eating you know good
food that's gonna make you feel good and
sleep well and be able to have the
energy to do things throughout the day
one of the first things I noticed about
starting to meal prep and eating more
Whole Foods more healthy foods and
eating as well just from home it's the
first place that I noticed it was in my
energy levels and in my mood
I don't list mental illness my whole
life and so I didn't really honestly
make the correlation that what I ate
could affect how I feel so heavily but
it wasn't until I started eating so much
healthier that I really noticed that it
actually does play such a role in how
you feel the healthier you eat the more
energy you have and just the better your
mood feels because your body is like
running properly it's giving yourself
you know your brain the energy to think
it's giving yourself the fuel you need
to be able to regulate your moods and to
be able to want to get up and do things
and not just kind of slug around all day
tip number three and this one is
probably the most difficult one for me
because I hate hate hate hate hate hate
hate the cold and it is to get outside
and I know it's not a fun thing to do in
the winter especially for those of you
guys like me that are you know up north
or anywhere where there's snow and it's
cold and it's blizzarding and the wind
like bites your face but bundle up and
get outside go for walks you know get
yourself like a hot chocolate or a
coffee you walk around downtown where
you live or go look at Christmas lights
go ice skating outdoor
is go do things outside just because
it's winter doesn't mean that we have to
hibernate indoors wait around for the
hot Summer Sun to come back around a lot
less you know hibernation and like
staying indoors and then just becoming
this like inside hermit so try and find
things you can do that you enjoy
outdoors which leads me to tip number
four and that is to create a cozy happy
environment at home to come home to so
whether you're returning from work or
you know going out and doing all of
those outdoor things and then coming
back inside rearrange your entire place
rearrange your bedroom your apartment
put up cozy lighting get yourself a nice
blanket pick up a new mug new slippers
and just cozy up your place so that you
enjoy being inside you know that you get
that like warm fuzzy feeling from just
being in your own space get as much
lighting as you can because obviously
it's so much darker in the wintertime so
having more lights especially stringed
cozy lights that's going to create such
a warm area for you to call home so yeah
just make inside as cozy and as you know
you and as welcoming as possible because
it's gonna make you feel better about
being indoors won't make you feel so bad
about not being on a tropical beach
somewhere tip number five is to start a
new hobby or a new goal coloring you
know picking up a new instrument maybe
it's doing something on the computer
who knows pick up a new hobby or set
yourself a new goal it could be maybe
you want to learn a new language by the
time the winter is over or maybe it's
that you want to get more fit by the
time the winters over setting yourself a
goal or starting a new hobby is going to
keep your mind sidetracked the more time
I have to think the more time I have to
over think the more time I have to
overanalyze the more I tend to almost
think myself into a depressive state so
coming up with a new hobby that's gonna
get you excited and it's gonna make you
want to like spend your time doing that
or setting yourself a new goal it keeps
you occupied it makes you feel like
you're still doing something or
accomplishing something through these
winter months and let it consume you
just get so involved in something
whether it be a hobby or a goal and just
keep your focus on that and you
even realize the fact that winter is
just passing you by and last but not
least tip number six is to make plans
whether that be with friends family
maybe you have a significant other
just keep plans constantly going you
know set plans for Friday night so you
have something to look forward to
whether it be going out for drinks with
your friends or maybe you're having like
a sleepover where everyone comes over in
pajamas or you know do things with your
boyfriend or your family just make sure
you're setting plans for yourself to do
things and to see people and to be
around people not only just to get your
spirits up but also because if you are
feeling down if you are feeling sluggish
and low don't be afraid to talk to those
people making plans with them and then
once you're hanging out with them if
you're still not feeling a hundred
percent this is like the perfect
opportunity to you know let people know
how you're feeling and talk it out talk
it out with the people that you care
about most and that care about you the
most I find that they have some piece of
wisdom or advice that'll make you feel
better or just getting it off your chest
it might even just make you feel better
give yourself events and dates to look
forward to that it's going to keep your
spirits up it's going to keep you
excited and it's going to make you you
know pumped for the things that you have
planned or give you an opportunity to
kind of vent out the way that you've
been feeling so that concludes my six
