coming up to you guys with an
organizational video that's like how to
adult style I feel like getting into
like your early 20s is that really
awkward stage where you can still kind
of get away with some of the stuff we
did as teenagers but there is a higher
responsibility level so I've got six
organizational hacks for you guys today
slash tips that are just going to help
you kind of get your together for
lack of a better word and these are all
things that you can pretty much adapt to
any age whether you are in your early
20s late 20s early 30s late teens
whatever it is you could pretty much
adapt all six of these hacks to your
life so without further ado and let's
figure out how the hell to adult so hack
number one and this is one that has
helped me immensely especially over the
last little bit is to get a notebook now
this doesn't have to be any specific
kind of notebook you could literally run
out to the dollar store and just grab
something that's got line pages in it
you could DIY a notebook you could get
fancy with it even if you don't do
anything else in this video just having
one solid notebook that you use for your
everyday life will literally change
everything it changes the whole game
keep it nearby
keep it by your bedside keep it in your
desk keep it in a backpack or in your
purse and use it to write down literally
everything passwords that you need to
remember numbers that you need to call
back reminders to do lists grocery lists
everything right the date at the top of
each page so that you know what date it
was you made those notes and then just
fill out your thoughts your ideas just
little things throughout the day where
you're like oh I need to remember that
or to download a certain song having a
notebook is so key even if you don't do
anything else in this video this will
save your life
so hack number two is to get a calendar
or an agenda if you're not an agenda
person or you feel like you don't really
need an agenda for your day-to-day
living then definitely get like a wall
calendar I personally love the dry erase
calendar so I picked one of those up
from Walmart recently and I will write
down my entire work schedule for the
whole month of head so I can look at
everything as a whole being able to
write down you know what days you work
what days you're going to work out when
you have doctor's appointments when you
have hair appointments anything like
that having it displayed right in front
of you on a calendar it's just so easy
and organized or better yet get and
Genda I actually live by my agenda I
would just be so flustered if I didn't
have it written right in front of me
most agendas have the calendar form and
then you flip the page and then it gives
you like actual blocks where you can
write down day to day what you're going
to do and this is also really good in
terms of getting like healthy and fit
and stuff like that you can plan out
your workouts you can plan out your meal
prep so you can do all of that stuff on
calendars or in agendas and again if
you're not somebody that wants to carry
any of these things around then you can
always use the agenda in your phone you
can even use these things to make like
six month plans or goals or you know
what I mean like checking in on you to
use resolutions that we've all
completely ditched and hack number three
I know I've already talked about this
multiple times now but utilize your
phone something that you always are
going to have on you is your phone
nobody can see what you're putting in
your calendars and your notes or
anything like that make one solid folder
on your phone and put in there like your
banking app your cell phone app your
calendar app your notes voice memos
anything like that any sort of apps that
you can use like your fitness power your
running track put it all into one folder
so that it's easily organized and ready
for you to use make sure you're also
using your phone to set alarms change
the labels on your alarms to make you
actually want to get out of bed when you
need to get out of bed this is one of
the easiest hacks because we do all
carry our phones around pretty much
everywhere with us we always have our
phones on us so doing this is one of the
easiest tips as well even if you don't
do anything else in this video this is
another half that if you do this one it
will change your life again I promise
hack number four is one that I have
found to be extremely extremely helpful
for me especially because I'm somebody
that like I can't deal with like clutter
and mess and it is to get a file folder
and put in that file folder receipts
that you need to keep four things put in
that file folder like things about your
pet like I like to put Bentley's vet
papers in there I like to put my tax
papers in there any sort of mail or any
sort of banking that I get from in the
mail I put those in there slips receipts
anything it's really really good
especially getting into this age to have
a file folder to keep all of these
important papers in because I mean I
know growing up my parents always just
did that for me so now that I'm living
on my own and I
these things to me I'm like what do I do
with all these papers like I don't want
to just toss them somewhere so I swear
it's actually so handy to do this tip
and it took me like two years of my
parents trying to like badger me to get
one being like get a file folder keep
your receipt I ended up actually caving
in and getting the file folder and it's
actually so helpful so that is a huge
huge tip in terms of adulting is getting
a file folder hack number five and this
is another really really important one
again moving into kind of like adding
jobs or careers or anything like that
and it is to make yourself a budget sit
down ask yourself what are the expenses
that you have every single month whether
that be rent your cell phone bill car
gas groceries anything like that and
write all those down with an estimate of
how much each will cost you every single
month total all of your necessities up
the things that you absolutely have to
pay for every single Mon take that and
take how much you make in a month
and subtract it so once you see what's
left take that and then organize it in
terms of how much you want to put into
savings how much you want to put into
recreational like going to the movies
going out for drinks going with your
friends shopping anything like that and
then pick one day like every two weeks
to sit down take your payment's and then
just disperse it really organizing your
banking and your money and planning
ahead for you like your savings and all
that is so crucial and so smart and one
of like the most tedious things to do
but probably one of the most important
things to learn at an earlier age so
that we're being smart with our money
for further on in life and then hack
number six is to declutter it's actually
been proven that you know keeping like
your space clean and your atmosphere
clean is really really good in terms of
keeping like your headspace clean so
pick a day go through your entire
bedroom or your apartment or your house
and declutter and get rid of anything
that you don't need a really really good
tip in doing this as well is when you go
to grab something and you're like will I
keep this or won't I keep this ask
yourself if you've used it in the last
six months if the answer is no then try
and toss it if you're still holding on
to it a little bit then ask yourself if
you've used it or needed it in the last
year and that the answer is still no
then donate it or get rid of it because
you really really really don't need it
get rid of all the junk that's just kind
of like sitting in corners and taking up
space and just clear it all out it will
make you feel so much better and
I think on how much stuff you have this
could literally just take one day plan a
Sunday blast some tunes get into some
really comfy sweatpants and just
completely declutter and organize and
just clear out your entire life so those
were my six tips and organizing your
life I hope you guys enjoy it as always
