for today's video I'm doing a meal prep
Monday with you guys and if you're
wondering what the heck is meal prep
Monday well allow me to elaborate just
last night I spent pretty much like four
hours I meet up with new ideas of things
I want to do on my channel and one of
the ideas that I had was I was initially
going to film a meal prep video for you
guys anyway but because I'm getting back
into meal prepping I figured why not
like every two weeks
upload a Monday video called meal prep
Monday just to show you guys what I'm
males prepping what I'm eating and all
of that jazz I'm trying to get really
really healthy again and get super fit
for the summertime and I figured we
could all do together
my whole haul for this was $70 which
means if you break it down day by day
it's about ten dollars a day and I also
had other things in that grocery haul
like a coffee creamer and paper towel so
if anything is actually cheaper than $10
a day as you guys will see at this
week's meal prep for less than $10 a day
I'm Jackie boy
so in the mornings I'm definitely more
of a smoothie gal I'm going to share
with you guys what I drink in my morning
smoothie I make sure to buy enough
bananas for the whole week I use one
banana a cup of frozen fruit and I
usually make my bananas a little bit
more ripe but I didn't have time to wait
and then I'll put a bit like a cup of
greens so this week is spinach and then
I add my maca powder and my show pika P
protein and I usually add about two
scoops of that and I have mine in the
chocolate flavor and then I just
literally add water and blend it all up
it sounds really bland but it's actually
super good and really really some
filling for the morning time especially
because of the protein powder and the
maca powder which have been my latest
obsession
and it's usually not too long after that
then I'm hungry for a snack so I'll have
one of my naked there fruit and nut bars
and these are like my latest actual
obsession I love them I travel with them
they're amazing and then for lunch I
decided to go ahead and make a quinoa
for readable so all I did so that was
cook up a bunch of quinoa I did a bit of
bag and a half since it was going to be
over the span of seven days and then
once that was cooked I just put it into
seven different containers and then you
can cook up your vegetables for this but
I decided to leave them more of a salad
so I cut up some romaine lettuce and
filled the other half of the bowls with
that and then I went ahead and cut up
some onion and some red pepper and then
filled the rest with chickpeas and
basically any corner vegetable that you
want to put in your burrito bowl
baby
now from here you can add in guacamole
or anything like that but I decided to
just cut up some avocado put that in
there and top it off with a lime wedge
and some cilantro as well as some pico
de gallo salsa and then I just kept some
extra salsa and guac in my fridge and
then every time I opened up one of the
containers I would just put a little bit
of guac salsa mix it all up squeeze the
lime juice on top and then go ahead and
eat it so then for snack number two of
the day I decided to keep a giant bowl
of salad in my fridge so I went ahead
and put a bunch of that spinach that we
used in the smoothie and cut up one full
head of romaine lettuce and then mix it
all together
and then all I did to meal prep this
salad was cut up any vegetables I had
left in my fridge so I cut up some red
pepper some onion I added some carrot
sticks the mushrooms basically anything
that you want to add to your salad and
then I just kept a double protein in my
fridge and by that I mean I had like
these quinoa bites and these sweet
potato and try sea bites and I keep
those in my fridge and then every time I
made myself a bowl the salad I would
just add my protein to it add my
dressing and then that was it so super
easy and I find it just easier to make a
giant bowl of this than to waste a bunch
of different containers and keeping it
all separate so yeah I just packaged up
about giant bowl and left it in the
fridge
and then finally for dinner I decided to
make seven portions of what I like to
call rice hoppers so I started off with
a bit of olive oil on top of some
brussel sprouts and then added some pink
Himalayan salt some garlic powder and
some lemon juice and toss this all up
but if you don't like Brussels sprouts
you can use broccoli asparagus literally
any vegetable that you enjoy that is
good to roast and then I just put them
on a baking sheet with parchment paper
and two giant sweet yams or sweet
potatoes and then I got went ahead put
that in the oven at about 425 for 45
minutes to about an hour it depends on
how roasted you want the Brussels
sprouts and then afterwards I just cut
up the sweet potato into chunks and then
distribute it over different bowls and
then I ended up making two more sweet
potatoes so it was for sweet potatoes
over the span of seven days and spanned
that out and then filled the rest of the
section with the Brussels sprouts and
then some black beans and then I made
myself a lime and garlic tahini sauce so
I just used some tahini some lime juice
and some garlic powder mix that all up
and added that on top so done all you
have to do is pull one of these out of
the fridge and put it on top of some
cooked rice so you can make anything you
want for a rice topper I just find them
super easy and it just spices up your
rice dish just a little bit so you can
add more vegetables to it when you're
going to cook it or yeah
but that's all you have to do to make
these little rice toppers and then I
just keep a giant bowl of cooked rice
in my fridge and ready to go and then
finally for dessert or your final snack
of the night I know it's not the best
beet fruit at night but I am like I need
that sweet little bite before the end of
the day so I cut up a bunch of pineapple
and strawberries and left that for nice
mom and away no ball and a thunder we
got coffin away make a filly till dusk
concludes this week's meal prep Monday

me to make this a biweekly series and
other than that I hope you guys enjoyed
