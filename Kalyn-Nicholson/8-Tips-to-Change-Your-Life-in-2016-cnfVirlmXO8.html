to talk to you guys about a very very
highly requested topic I'm sorry if you
guys can't hear me very well right now I
am filming outside I'm here in Florida
with Raya and we're filming today's
video but I don't have my microphone
with me so I'm going to try and talk as
loud as possible but I'm outside and
there's cars driving by like a road
right there so if it gets loud
I apologize first of all happy new year
that was meant to go when I said that
but happy early new year so it was
really highly requested that I do a
video where I talk about like simple
ways to change your life or just in
general how to change your life for the
better with the new year coming up and I
definitely feel like that's a topic that
I've been even just looking into for
myself so by no means am i any expert
but I'm going to tell you guys this tips
and tricks on things that I'm trying to
do to better myself and be the kind of
person that I want to be in 2016 so I
have nine ways or tips or tricks or
whatever you want to call it for
changing your life in the new year so
let's jump in so first and foremost is
to make a plan and that sounds kind of
obvious but by make a plan I mean ditch
resolutions I actually got to meet up
with rachhloves just recently and her
and I were talking about New Year's
resolutions and such and she kind of
gave me this really cool concept of
instead of resolutions to do kind of
like overall like ideas of the things
you want to change for the new year the
more I thought about it is so true
resolutions sometimes can be too
specific to the point that we end up not
being able to kind of stick to them if
that makes any sense to give an example
like if I made one of my new year's
resolutions to read a hundred books this
year if I started falling behind I would
probably end up ditching that resolution
within the first month whereas if I made
my resolution more of like an overall
topic like or an overall idea like I
want to read more in 2016 then that
gives more like an achievable goal where
I can be like okay I least want to read
15 minutes every single day rather than
I want to read a hundred books in one
year a really good way to look at this
is instead of being like okay this is my
goal look at it as this is my habit so
what type of habits do you want to pick
up what types of habits do you want to
ditch do you want to stop being so lazy
do you want to stop fascinating do you
want to start waking up earlier do you
want to start reading more do you
start working out horn don't make it oh
I want to lose ten pounds or oh I want
to tone up this make it I just want to
work out more and feel better and eat
better and if you do die it's going to
be a lot easier for you to stick to your
goals and to make a plan surrounding
those goals another really good idea is
to make a priority list and this is
something that's really healthy in terms
of if you're someone that tends to feel
very overwhelmed by the amount of things
you want to do or change making a
priority list and setting which
priorities come first and above others
makes it easier so that when you're
feeling overwhelmed and like you have a
million things to do or a million things
to change you can look at what comes
first
so in terms of like oh I want to read
more but it's also more important to me
to spend more time with family than when
you're running short on time or you have
a little bit of time to do one of those
things you can be like okay I could read
right now but I could also go spend a
little bit of time of family because
that was higher on my priority list for
2016 so tip number two is to download
some self develop development or
purchase some self development books and
I know that might not be everybody's cup
of tea but I'm going to leave a list of
my favorites down below of just books
that got me really inspired and gave me
a lot of good tips and tools on how to
actually start changing my life so it's
one thing to say you want to change
things it's another thing to actually go
ahead and change them and if you've
never really changed your life before or
you've been living the same way all the
way up until now it's going to be really
hard for you to change your life without
knowing exactly how to do that so one of
my favorites is you are badass I will
leave a link to it down below amongst a
bunch of other books that I'm reading
right now and if you don't really like
to read a really good idea to is to
download the audio versions which is
exactly what I did we had to drive 24
hours to get up here and I pretty much
swamped Ryan with audio books the whole
way out but it was really cool because
it got me really excited and inspired to
make my resolution to my goal or if
you're not someone that really likes
books maybe look up some documentaries
or different things like that that's
going to get you inspired to actually
make change tip number three is now you
need to put that change into action so
you as a planner or make a schedule so
if your overall idea was I want to start
reading more and then now you know that
to start reading more you have to push
yourself to start reading more well now
you have to plan when you're going to
read so whether it's 15 minutes before
bed or if it's working out maybe you
want to work out every single morning
and all of that so get a planner or set
a set schedule for yourself and really
start
mapping out exactly how you plan on
tackling these habits or these goals
that you want to change for 2016 so if
you don't have a planner maybe get a dry
erase board and stick it on your wall
right Monday to Friday across the top
and then write down which days you're
going to be doing which things that's
going to help improve your life and
really put those goals into motion so
tip number four and this is one of the
most important ones following up on
everything we just talked about the
whole reason you probably want to change
your life for the better is so that you
feel better so in terms of changing all
of these things you want to keep track
on how you're feeling of along the way
so I only started really taking
journaling seriously about two or three
years ago now that I'm making all these
changes and I'm working really hard how
is it making me feel and even if I don't
feel that great at the moment I know
that eventually it's going to make me
feel better but I like to keep track on
how I feel along the way and really kind
of reevaluate and reconnect with the
things that I'm trying to do and the
person that I'm trying to be and with
doing that it all requires kind of
sitting with your thoughts and maybe if
you don't like to journal or write you
can just sit and be with yourself and
your thoughts or meditate or whatever it
is that you like to do just make sure
you're keeping track of how you feel
along the way so tip number five is
probably the most important in terms of
staying on top of your goals and
sticking to this plan that you're making
for yourself and that is to stay
inspired and this is going to be
different for all of us so for me
personally staying inspired requires you
know like making an inspiration board so
that I can look at exactly what I'm
trying to achieve or looking at what my
idols are doing or asking myself when
I'm starting to lose faith or I'm
starting to like lose my momentum
what would my idol do if that makes any
sense so like what would they do and
eventually you you stop having to ask
yourself what would they do because it
becomes what would you do and just
things like that making your phone
background something that is you're
trying to achieve whether it's a beach
or whether it's you know I don't know
whatever it is change your phone
background so that's going to inspire
you change your computer background make
an inspiration board and hang it up on
your wall right exactly out in a journal
or on a piece of paper exactly what you
want your life to look like in five
years ten years whatever it is and then
every morning read it every night read
it
keep inspired and I'm not joking and get
into as much detail as possible and then
read it every morning read it every
night so that you're pumped up and
you're
always kind of rechecking in with
exactly where you're trying to get in
life
and it's keeping you away from all the
distractions and keeping you inspired
for tip number seven this one's actually
a lot more important than we might think
and it's a lot harder than a lot of the
other ones and that is to leave anything
or anyone that brings you any type of
turmoil in your life in 2015 you need to
make sure that you're surrounding
yourself with people that inspire you or
surrounding yourself with people that
are trying to work towards the type of
goals that you're working towards and if
there's anyone or anything or any bad
habit that you have right now that's
holding you back then you need to leave
it in 2015 there is no excuse for you to
stick around anyone that treats you like
crap or to continue to treat yourself
like crap so leave it behind in 2015 and
move forward in 2016 leaving anything
that brings you any type of turmoil or
negativity in your life leave it behind
there's no use for it and there's
nothing wrong with leaving those things
behind you were not a bad person you are
just trying to work towards getting the
life that you want and you can't do that
when you constantly have this baggage
that's weighing you down
so tip number eight and this is the
utmost important tip on this entire
video and it is to believe in yourself
and love yourself and that sounds so
corny
I know trust me but in terms of just
everything you're trying to accomplish
you're never going to do it if you don't
believe in yourself along the way when
you're constantly telling yourself that
you're not good enough or you can't do
the things that you want to do or that
you'll never get there then the universe
is going to react by never letting you
get there or never letting you
accomplish those things the first step
in changing anything about your life is
learning how to believe in yourself and
trust yourself and all in all kind of
love yourself in all reality there is
nothing that we're going to ever be able
to do if we're not kind of supporting
ourselves along the way be nice to
yourself and know that you're going to
make mistakes you're going to have
setbacks you're not always going to
stick hundred-percent to these goals but
that is okay don't give up on yourself
don't give up on your plan just breathe
and keep trying and keep going and
you're not perfect nobody is so stop
holding yourself to that type of
standard and understand that mistakes
are going to happen but don't beat
yourself up just keep trying and keep
believing in yourself and my last and
final tip which is tip number nine is to
breathe it in and as Ryan wanted me to
say carp diem
right is that how you say it carpet diem
seize the day
breathe it in this is a youngest you are
ever going to be this moment right now
is the only moment that's happening in
your life the past is gone the future
doesn't exist yet so just breathe it in
do your best every single moment that
you can relax and rest when you need to
recharge and work hard and just do your
best
keep your mindset happy keep your energy
high and the universe will reciprocate
the energy that you're putting out there
making sure you plan your life and have
set bowls of things that you want to
accomplish and do is so important but it
never comes above you know breathing in
exactly where you're at right now you
don't need to be where you want to be
right at this moment it's just not going
to happen just pretend that it's already
yours and act as if it's already yours
and then you'll enjoy life all the way
up until the point that you get to where
you want to be so breathe it in
be happy enjoy life and just work hard
at your goals and eventually you will
get there but don't forget to enjoy
every single moment that leads up to it
