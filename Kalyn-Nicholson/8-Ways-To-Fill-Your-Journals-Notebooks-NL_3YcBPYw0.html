I had done my brainy missing I can tell
by the way you're turning in your sleep
you've been holding out on me and you
better not be that close if you all of
me I'm never frontin
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video it is the 23rd day of
you Tober and we're doing a really fun
one today I've been seeing requests for
this video since the summertime so when
I was making the each over schedule I
figured it'd be fun to throw it in here
and it is a ways to fill your notebooks
and journals you might already know by
now if you've watched my life plan with
me video and things like that that I
actually love journals and notebooks I
have a list book I like a book for every
possible thing you could have a notebook
for and so I figured I would throw all
of my little book ideas plus a few new
ones that I wanted to try out into this
video just to show you guys simple and
easy ways that you guys can fill up
notebooks you maybe already have at home
or if you're like me and you just get a
weird sense of joy from buying notebooks
like every time I go to chapters I
always buy a new notebook because
they're so cute that I just can't notify
them so it's imperative to find ways to
fill them all up and plus it's just
really fun to do so if you guys want to
know all the ways and ideas that I use
to fill my journals and notebooks then
just keep watching
so for starters the first way to fill
your notebook is to create a notebook
solely for just your life lists this can
be anything from books you want to read
to movies you want to watch two shows
you want to watch two bucket list items
or goals that you have long-term
short-term I use this book literally to
create a list out of anything whether I
need to make a grocery list that day
whether I have a list of things that I
want to do you know before I kick the
bucket like there's literally a million
lists inside of here and it's just a
really fun and easy way to keep all of
those things kind of compact into one
notebook and every time you finish
something off of any of your life lists
you can highlight it or tick it off and
it just keeps everything nice
and again you can make lists of places
you want to travel restaurants you want
to try in your city I've also done a
whole video on how to make a travel or
memory diary if you guys haven't seen
that yet I'll pop it up on the screen
but pretty much anything you could
possibly make a list for could go inside
this book these are perfect when it
comes to making an idea notebook and
I've been recently kind of obsessed with
making title pages for all of my books
so I just created a little page that
said ideas and plans and all the things
that could go inside of this are song
ideas if you ever have like poem ideas
that you have or just random things that
pop into your head in the middle of the
night when you're sleeping you could
keep this by your bedside anything could
possibly go in here in terms of goals
just any possible plan or idea including
even just mapping out how you want to
rearrange your furniture could go inside
of this tiny little book and it's easy
to bring with you places too since I
find this is a good one to travel
sometimes I feel so happy sometimes
feels
sometimes feels so heavy so the next way
you could possibly fill a notebook
whether it be small or big is to fill it
with all of your favorite quotes now
this is one that I'm kind of surprised I
haven't done already since you probably
know by now I put quotes at the
beginning of all of my videos so I have
a lot of favorite quotes and so this is
when I was really excited about and I
think I'm gonna stay on top of this one
every time I put a quote my video I'm
gonna put a quote in this little book
it's just something else that is really
fun and in positive and inspiring to
read if you're having a bad day and you
can add to it anytime you want or
anytime you need just a little bit of
inspiration
the next way you could fill a notebook
preferably one that has blank pages is
by creating a book solely for mood
boards and dream boards so obviously
your dreams and your moods are
constantly changing so it's hard to make
one solid dream board at a time so you
can use this notebook to cut out
magazine articles to cut out some of
your favorite inspirational photos to
make a page dedicated to each dream or
goal you have or to create just a mood
board if you're feeling you know kind of
vibe II for a day for instance I did a
buying a condo for my dream and then I
did a mood board for October just
because you know I'm like still just
trying to soak up every last bit of
October well I still can
and we can't forget the original
sketchbook or doodle book I find this
book especially helps for nights that
I'm feeling anxious I'll just pull this
out sketch random things or draw random
things for fun and for literally
nobody's eyes but myself and it's just a
fun way to kind of de-stress and
decompress so you guys might recognize
this journal here from my night routine
and morning routines but the other way
that you can fill up notebooks is by
doing a stream of consciousness journal
a lot of you guys ask what I write in my
journal and honestly I just try every
morning or if I can't in the morning at
night to just sit down and write up my
thoughts without filtering them and just
kind of get everything out onto paper
and then next another really great idea
for a smaller notebook especially and
one that you can keep in your bedside as
well is a gratitude or a thankful
notebook where you just write down all
the little things that your EVO thankful
for in the morning or I especially find
that this helps at nighttime just
keeping this in my night side table and
writing down just a few like happy
things or thoughts from the day it's
such a huge like change and boost in
your mood and it's just something that
you can keep kind of slowly to yourself
for no one else to see but it just
reminds you of all the little like lame
but happy things in life
and last but not least you can also make
a memory journal now I think this is
really cool not only just to kind of
remind yourself of all the cool fun
things you did growing up but one day if
you decide to have kids or you have
grandkids this is something you can
either leave behind or even read to them
and show them kind of your life along
the way or you know like I said read it
to yourself and just reminisce on all
the good times you had growing up and
it's you could just leave dates in here
you could like leave pictures you could
leave tickets to things that you went to
the options are quite endless so that is
it for today's video I hope you guys
enjoyed it leave a comment down below
letting me know if you guys have any
other ideas in terms of building
notebooks and journals and if you guys
decide to try any of them out be sure to
tweet or Instagram them at me I will pop
my Twitter my Instagram right here on
the screen so definitely tag me so I can
see and other than that I love you guys
