to be talking to you guys about eight
ways to de-stress and I kind of came up
with this video idea because to be a
hundred percent honest with you I've had
a couple of stressful weeks I kind of
just got really lazy and started
procrastinating all the things I knew I
had to do all of those things I knew I
should be doing long story short I came
up with the idea of dumbing this video
for you guys for all of you that might
be in any sort of situation like that or
maybe you've got like school for your
job is stressing you out or something
big in your life is stressing you out or
just in general you're a very stressed
out person so this is going to be like
emergency de-stress video like 8 ways
how you can instantly de-stress yourself
and you can come back and watch this
video at any point if you feel really
stressed out so those further ado let's
jump into the 8 ways to de-stress so
number one and it's one of the first
things that I have found has helped me
be most is to fake it until you make it
you're probably good what what you can't
just fake not being stressed but in all
honesty you can force yourself to laugh
you can force yourself to smile you can
throw on some music and sing along to it
or dance to it even if you really don't
feel like the urge to when I'm stressing
out and I'm in my head and all of these
thoughts are consuming me if I just like
force a smile on my face it instantly
kind of tricks your brain into thinking
that you're happier so it might be a
good idea to have like a specific song
sometimes I'll just sew on some Bob
Marley and just kind of sway around my
apartment because it just makes me feel
better I'll put on like some good like
Swift and just dance it out with mags or
something and you know what I think's
just like when you're feeling all that
stress and you are so not in the mood to
dance you're so not in the mood to sing
or laugh or play or just have a good
time forcing yourself to do so will kind
of trick your brain and get the ball
rolling so that maybe you'll start to
feel better so number 2 is another
really important one and it's to have a
specific space where you can go to just
get away and this is a space where
you're not going to want to be doing any
schoolwork any type of like homework any
type of work for work like anything like
that anything that stresses you out is
not allowed in this space so maybe you
go and you listen to music or you read a
book or you meditate but wherever you
end up doing you go to the spot and you
sit down and it's away from everything
and everyone and it's just your little
place it's your happy place so you can
make this a corner in your room you can
make this a whole room in your house you
could live
designate a specific spot that you know
of even if it's a place outside like you
go for a hike to the specific spot in
the woods or in a park and you just sit
there and you put in your headphones or
you read a book and and it's just like
your place so number three is to take on
any sort of small project now this can
be cleaning this could be like if you
have a piece of furniture you bought
from Ikea and you have a built it yet
and you just you take on like two three
hours that day and you just build that
piece of furniture like I'm pointing at
myself because I really need to do that
it could literally be just taking on a
task that you've wanted to do for a long
time like maybe painting a room or
anything like that that's such a small
project that you could get done in one
day I find this is extremely helpful
when you find that you're stressed and
out of it things that you kind of have
no control over so whether it be that
you have a big test coming up and no
matter how much you prepare you're still
super stressed out or if it's just
something that's completely out of your
control or if you have a really really
bad anxiety or anything like that taking
on a small project is something that I
have found has helped me like one of the
most out of all of the tips on here I
don't know what it is but sometimes just
throwing on some tunes and building
something or painting a room or cleaning
the crap out of my house there's
something about that that just feels so
satisfying it's like you're checking
something off you've got something done
and even if it's not related to what
you're stressed out about just getting a
project done makes you feel accomplished
it makes you feel good and then it makes
you want to do something else makes you
want to finish something else accomplish
something else so number four is to talk
it out and this could be with someone
you really care about or if you're
really stressed about something that you
don't really want to share with those
close to you another thing you could do
is go online and try and find like a
forum or anywhere that people are kind
of having a similar issue or similar
stress to what you're having I mean part
of the reason why the internet is such a
great place like I know with me when I
was just starting to kind of really
struggle with my anxiety and depression
and stuff going online and finding other
people that were feeling the exact same
way as me made me feel so much better
that I wasn't alone in it so whether you
sit down with a friend or family member
and you talk it all out and you talk
about all the things that are stressing
you out
it gets it all out of your head and out
of your shoulders and kind of puts it
not on to somebody else but you're
letting it out so somebody else can help
make you feel better and I mean
sometimes just talking things out can
help you find a solution sometimes
finding somebody that might feel the
same way as you can help you feel less
alone this is something that I have
personally struggled with for awhile I'm
someone that I don't normally open up to
people very very easily but the more you
do so the more vulnerable you allow
yourself to be honestly the better
you're going to feel just be safe like
don't be talking to like strangers or
giving out any personal info and I feel
like I should just reiterate that before
I tell you guys to just go jump on some
forum so number five is a really
important one and I feel like a lot of
us struggle with this one because we
feel like we're being selfish but it's
to treat yourself like honestly there is
nothing wrong with treating yourself
every once in a while and that could be
getting yourself a massage or if you
don't have any money for like a massage
honestly fill your bath up with hot
water and bubbles and grab a glass of
wine or like a tea and watch your
favorite TV show for 30 minutes or an
hour or play some video games or do
something that's specifically just for
you grab yourself some of your favorite
takeout and sit down on your couch and
throw on a movie just every once in a
while don't be afraid to treat yourself
we can all get into those lines that's
where we start taking everything so
seriously and feeling like we need to
give pieces of ourselves to all of these
different responsibilities and we often
overlook the responsibility of taking
care of ourselves so number six is to
workout and I know what you're all
thinking like a standard I'm Akash
workout to de-stress but honestly
honestly I stopped working out for so
long probably a few weeks there and I
started picking it back up again when I
was getting really really stressed out
and I was getting stressed out to the
point and this doesn't happen very often
like almost angry and pissy and like
chucking stuff around and slamming doors
and that's when I know that I am
incredibly stressed out if I'm ever in a
really really bad mood like angry mood
or frustrated mood that's when I know
things are getting to me
whether it's yoga cardio or even just
like a quick little body workout at your
house for like 15-20 minutes just doing
that it lowers your stress levels and it
also raises your endorphins so it's
automatically going to make you feel
happier automatically going to
you feel less stressed out and just all
in all you're going to feel better about
taking care of yourself I worked out
last night and I was in a really bad
mood and afterwards I was just like
ready to get done all night I was
in such a good mood after so tip number
seven is kind of a sound one and it's to
cry out and that kind of sounds funny
but honestly I feel like for all of us
were also like stressed out and we have
all of these emotions we're trying to
keep them all the way over here and be
like no I just want to be happy but
sometimes to get over those emotions you
kind of have to let them in just give
yourself 15 minutes let it take over you
and just cry it out
you can cry that long you can cry it out
with a friend you can cry note with me
if you like after you have your cry you
can sit there and be like okay I was
upset I'm not upset anymore I let it
know now what am I gonna do about it
what's my plan every once a while you
just have to have a good cry like a good
old cry late at night by yourself in bed
we all do it and then my last and final
tip is to remember how small our
problems are and the grand scheme of
things it can seem like sometimes even
for myself when I get really stressed
out or there's been a lot of problems or
there's a lot of stuff going on and I'm
overwhelmed and of stressed and I'm
emotional that I almost forget how small
and insignificant my little life is in
terms of like the whole universe when
you look at it as a whole and you really
take that step back and gain perspective
at how small our problems are and how
lucky we are to even just be able to
wake up and breathe and be here it can
really kind of you know change your
perspective we all have so much going on
in our lives that sometimes I over
complicate things like I make things in
my head a lot worse than they really are
so take a step back and look at how
small your stress or your problems are
as opposed to everything going on in the
world just the fact that you're
breathing right now and you're sitting
on a chair watching this video like how
utterly amazing that is and then come up
with a solution kick it in the butt and
continue kicking ass at life because
honestly we're all badasses we're all
awesome I'm not trying to be too preachy
right now but whole point of being on
this earth of being alive to me anyways
is to enjoy the ride so those are my
