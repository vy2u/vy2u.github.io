our way into the blow
good morning and welcome back to another
vlog it is currently not f where kids 11
so it's Wednesday July 5th I'm going to
be blogging today and tomorrow with you
guys it's I'm starting this vlog a
little late in the day it's 11 a.m. I
woke up this morning around like 8:00
definitely for a quick walk and then I
went for a run oh my god it was so hot
today I'm dying I found this really cool
new route though that I think I'm going
to start running that's like right along
the water and I didn't even know it
existed and it's like all the sudden you
go from being in the city to entering
like a forest slash Park and it just
smells like kind and it's amazing I'm
like super shaky going to try and show
you guys how much I ran today so today I
ran 5.37 kilometers in 28 minutes and 45
seconds with my average pace being 521
so that was my run of the day I woke up
this morning like not wanting to run at
all I'm exhausted still from flying home
I missed a whole nights worth of sleep
and so yesterday I was so wiped I didn't
work out so this morning as much as I
didn't want to I forced myself to do it
I'm so glad I did because I feel so much
better anyway
cut back to the intro vlog then after
that I showered have some breakfast for
breakfast today I just had banana
blueberries with cinnamon on top and a
big glass of orange juice because I had
a huge dinner last night so it's still
feeling like really full today and like
super like bloated and just like yeah
just wasn't dying of hunger but knew I
needed to eat something so that's all my
morning started and that's what I ate
I'm also about half a litre of water
into the day I want to
and start drinking about three litres of
water a day we'll see how we do I
brought this water bottle from the
airplane back and I'll show it to you
guys but it's one exact leader so I feel
like that makes it easy for me because I
was like I know if I drink three of
those and I've topped off my goal for
the day so today's goal is to drink
three liters of water so I'm actually
about to call an uber I need to go pick
up my Jeep if you guys remember I kind
of briefly told you guys about it and
get ready with me and also on snapchat
but about two three weeks ago now my
Jeep got hit by a truck and it was in
the shop while I was away and so now I
need to go pick it up today I'm so
excited oh my god been so long since
I've had my Jeep so that's my plan right
now I'm going to order up the uber and
I'm going to take Bentley with me and
then after today I'm yesterday actually
Bentley and I went exploring we did a
long long walk to a bunch of different
parks in Toronto and I scoped at a
couple areas that I can get some work
done and bring Bentley with me so I'm
either going to head up a patio today or
I'm going to hit up one of those parks
with Ben he's a super tired because he
was with Greg's family while I was away
and they owned a cottage so he was like
out of cottage the entire he was living
the dream while I was gone guys a lot of
you guys ask what happens with Bentley
well the way he was living the dream he
was at a cottage he was running around
and he's been so tired and then I keep
taking him on all these walks and at the
end like literally yesterday what I was
walking with him he just like looked up
at me and was just like mom carry me
like I can't do it the day just going to
progress I'm gonna show you guys what I
eat in this vlog I'm also going to share
with you guys my workouts for today and
tomorrow and I'm debating whether or not
I kind of want to do vlogging over the
next like month just log a bunch and
then just break it down into a bunch of
different videos we're going to see how
this goes this is like my tester rat
fingers crossed or let me know if you
guys want more vlogs because I could
definitely start walking daily and then
condense them into like two to three
videos a week there's also a lot of
exciting announcements to do with ebooks
and some other stuff in this blog so
stay tuned for that but in the meantime
let's go get driz poor guys and autozone
so I just got back from I ended up just
going to Starbucks Bentley is so tired
today I wanted to give the poor guy a
break so I ended up just going there and
I actually rented the bikes here in
Toronto which is something I've never
done before and best thing ever probably
going to be doing that so much so I
actually like to write into the heart of
downtown just pick the little Starbucks
and got that video edited came back and
now I'm just watching some How I Met
Your Mother and making some sweet
potatoes I'm baking two sweet potatoes
to eat it's kind of like a late lunch
because it's 3:30 going on four but I'm
meeting a friend of mine at 7:00 for
some drinks and possibly like a nap or
two so I'm going to meet Kat then and
then I could be eating then so I want to
be like eat something to timing over for
now so I'm basically just going to make
two sweet potatoes and through round
them in sriracha so I guess all I have
you here it's a good time to kind of
tell you guys a couple updates so many
of you guys been asking for dream
catcher updates and it's hard for me to
give you that because I'm kind of
waiting on passing it to somebody to see
if they can if they can like get it
published so if that doesn't happen soon
I think I'm just going to go ahead and
publish it myself but the other book if
you guys remember on one of my live
streams I told you guys that I actually
wrote a second book and that book is
going to be an e-book and it's going to
be released you guys before dreamcatcher
is one to tight that's over into just
because it's completely different than
dreamcatcher and I feel like one stream
captures out I'm going to want to write
the second one to it so I just wanted to
get this one out of the way and I
actually came up with a date this
morning for when that is going to be
released and it's going to be August 3rd
some mark that on your calendars because
August 3rd my ebooks going to go live
and it's called hash tag feels that's
all I'm going to tell you guys for now
I'm so excited though guys I've been
working on it like crazy the past couple
of days and I'm so excited to let you
guys know that like the release date and
I'm going to tweet it out once this vlog
goes live I have so much to do between
now and then and one of the things that
I need to find is an artist to help me
out with some art that I want to get
done for the book I could try and do it
but I want it done really nice so if you
know anyone that can create art that
kind of looks like this
or if you yourself can create art like
that then definitely shoot me an email
I'm going to leave something down below
so I can look at some of your stuff
because I'm looking to
or somebody just to make a couple of
like pieces for the book and then my
second update for you guys if you
remember me telling you that I wanted to
start a line or like a clothing line or
just in general like I wanted to start
my own not necessarily merchandise but
just like I want to start a line called
clothes and COEs has been like a baby is
mine for so long and it's been this idea
that I've had in this dream that I've
had four before since before I moved to
Toronto I kind of came up with the idea
of COEs and so you guys go on my website
you'll notice at the top the banner says
codes and I I think it's initially it's
going to happen I think it's going to
happen so Greg is going to help me that
is my second update I don't have a date
for that yet but it should actually be
pretty soon as one of the first things
that I want to kind of release four
codes like the first ever clothing piece
is something that's kind of summer
related so I want to get that done very
very soon for you guys so that is going
to be something that's happening soon
too and I'm so excited I am going to
working on this like I tried to go to
sleep early last night it didn't happen
I was working on all these things
because I'm so I'm just so excited to
kind of get them up and out to you guys
I really just want to do this on my own
and just show myself that I can do this
on my own kind of like when I started my
youtube channel so that's kind of been
my update so August 3rd hashtag feels my
first ebook is going to go live and it's
going to be ready for you guys to
purchase and then my second update was
that COEs is also going to be launched
so soon on that note my other source of
excitement right now are the sweet
potatoes that I'm pretty sure just
finished in the oven so I'm going to
swatch the crap out of those watch them
How I Met Your Mother and get that video
up and then yeah kind of move on with
the day
I keep it player why can't you play it
safe
 the little missus didn't say that
hey hey and I've been sister this is the
way ever since the fifth grade we go
marketplaces synthase I put my idea to
the good morning it's now
Thursday it is actually 10:30 in the
morning I'm getting a little bit of a
late start to the day but my body feels
really exhausted today so I'm just going
to kind of like try not to over push
myself I had some oatmeal this morning
that I totally forgot to film I just
made some apple cinnamon oatmeal and cut
up a banana inside of it with some
orange juice that's all I had for
breakfast since I woke up it just been
like craving salty foods like it's
taking everything out of me not to order
a burrito right now I'm not going to
even make myself a stir fry for lunch
but I'm getting a little bit Restless
right now so I think what I want to do I
have a few things on my to-do list today
my workout isn't going to be until
tonight I'm doing a hot yoga at 9:00
p.m. so I think today I'm going to get
like just kind of breathe and take it
easy okay like with one of the things I
love what I do but one of the one of the
huge one of the huge pitfalls of it is
that I spend day in and day out just
with Bentley it's hard not to get cabin
fever when you kind of work for yourself
by yourself lately that has been like a
very overwhelming like festering feeling
so I'm trying to get out of the house
more even just like taking Bentley for
long walks out so I'm trying to get a
house more even just to take Bentley for
like some exploring or biking or just
doing what I got to do like even just
going to Walmart and doing a bit of
shopping for videos and stuff yeah I'm
going to put some pants on I'm currently
not wearing any and cue some music and
exclu is Bentley
okay
so I'm not quite sure what my last
update with you guys was but it is now
like 6:00 p.m. this afternoon I just did
a bunch of work on my laptop so there
was really not much for being a blog
with you guys but I'm back to tell you
guys what I'm eating for dinner I'm
actually making myself more potatoes
just because there's a bunch of food
that I need to use up in my fridge so
I'm going to be cooking up some potatoes
some corn and then using things like
spinach and a bunch of undies I don't
really know to making I'm just going to
make like a massive like smorgasbord of
vegetables on plate for dinner yeah I've
been coming up with a bunch of video
concepts that I'm going to be doing for
the next little bit I'm going to be
doing a lot of vlog style videos but
that has themes to them like my fitness
routine what I eat in a day is a lot of
things like that because I more recently
have been taking obviously you guys know
like all the little challenges that I'm
doing like my 60-day challenge which I'm
almost half way through by the way I
haven't had coffee guys in like over
three weeks now but my finish challenge
like all of these like challenges that
I'm doing I kind of want to a condensed
them into a video for you guys as well
or blog posts but also it's like really
inspiring me to like working out a lot
I've been drinking a lot of water I've
been eating a lot of really healthy
foods and I'm getting this just like gut
feeling that that's kind of where I want
to start directing my channel more
towards like I've been getting super
passionate again about I've always been
very passionate about being vegan but
just feeling like that kind of like the
concepts of videos that I really want to
start moving into is just like health
like basically fitness and fashion like
those are what I kind of want like my
top two pillars to be a fitness being
like health and fitness so not just you
know physical health but also mental
health I've been planning my video
schedule for the last little bit so they
literally like the last hours let me
know that stuff you guys want to see or

definitely want to know what you guys
want to see if there's any kind of like
food related fitness related health
related fashion related videos that you

comment section and yeah like 10 p.m.
I'm going to conclude this vlog here I
don't even remember the last clip I
filmed today ended up being a big like
work on your laptop day so there wasn't
that much footage so hopefully I got
enough yesterday to make this an
actually interesting blog I have so much
to do in the morning I literally spent
again the last hour like mapping out the
next few vlogs and when to be doing

coming that I think you guys would be
super pumped about like some summer
recipes and stuff like that which I'm
filming tomorrow I have to be up super
early to go for a run in the morning and
to get a bunch of stuff done I've been
chugging back water to try it like this
