got the wait we just catching Emily's
weapons is up to date he gets into your
bad flows right through your blood you
can tell each other see hey guys so for
today's video I have a really really fun
announcement to make for you guys um
there's a few things I'm gonna have to
explain to you guys in this intro so I'm
apologizing now if it's a little law if
you guys want to skip ahead to the video
by all means go right ahead first things
first this video is going to be the
breakout video for my new subscriber of
the month series so what I'm going to be
doing is choosing one subscriber every
single month and it's going to be at
random based on the comments in each
subscriber of the month video so this
being the first subscriber of the month
video one of your random comments down
below is going to be chosen for the next
subscriber of the month so that would be
for the month of June basically what the
subscriber of the month is as I chose a
subscriber and the first subscriber of
the month is bacon 20 so congratulations
to bacon 20 you guys can go pick up my
blog post down below to learn a little
bit more about bacon 20 and this was the
video she actually requested so because
she was a subscriber of the month I sent
her a little package or a little gift
and then she got to request this video
so this is the video I'm doing for her
and it's a day in the life or kind of
like a follow me around or hang out with
me for the day and you guys are good to
see how I made my little tapestry tent
in this video as well so if you guys
want to be a next month's subscriber of
the month and get a video request a
Skype call with me and a little gift
from me then just go ahead and read the
details down below next just because I
know I've been getting a lot of
questions about this I just want to
quickly explain to you guys my new
apartment situation and everything going
on with Ryan and I and all of that since
a lot of you guys been asking questions
so you'll definitely get I get to see a
little bit of my new apartment in this
video now currently living this my best
friend mags and part-time with Ryan if
that makes any sense
long story short Ryan got a job he has
to work four hours away but it's not
like secured like he's not going to be
staying in that one specific spot he
could have technically been moving
around and all that stuff
I decided to stay back and hold down a
new fort I guess with our furniture and
all that stuff so when he does come home
he does live here and it's the three of
us but while he's away it's basically
just Maggie and I so Ryan's about four
hours away from me so we're kind of
doing a long-distance thing for a little
while but we're gonna see each other
Lots
and in the meantime I'm living with my
best friend so you guys are gonna get to
see a lot of that and basically that was
just because I didn't want to be alone
and sad all the time so it worked out
and we got to get a bigger apartment and
if you guys want to see an apartment
tour or a room tour or an office tour or
anything like that just go ahead and
thumbs up this video so other than that
sorry but this super long inch oh I hope
you guys enjoy this little follow me
around for the day it's basically just a
day where Meg's and I just kind of went
walking around looking at shops and
getting like little things to do for the
apartment and make dinner and it was
just kind of like a relaxing day or like
just like a chill day where we didn't
have to do too much so basically if you
guys want to join us then just keep
watching
so as you guys probably already know
sushi is one of my favorite things to
eat so now that we live downtown we live
really close to our favorite sushi
joints so that's usually where we go to
get some lunch I'll still be
'we then we decided to go around and
look at cute little shops that have like
weird knickknacks and just random stuff
in them so we walked around and kind of
checked out these types of places and so
now
and lately I've been really obsessed
with plants and little planter pots so I
got this little elephant mug from Urban
Outfitters and a little plant from a
plant store on the street and I made
myself a little planter pot out of the
elephant and it's like my new favorite
thing and then of course now that we're
living downtown we have like these big
bay windows so friendly likes to stare
out them and then we also live really
close to Starbucks now so we decided to
grab some iced coffees and this was a
couple hours later and pop the screen
out and we go and hang out on the roof
and we blare country music from the
kitchen
you see where
we and now that we're downtown Bentley
loves to go on long walks so I'll
usually take him for one every other day
or so and then we decided to go to
HomeSense and a bunch of just home
places and get some things for the
apartment and I also picked up a few
things to make a little tapestry tent
and then we headed home and made some
dinner and Bakey is also vegan now so
it's really easy to live together
because we can just make meals for the
both of us so we made pasta and watch
some How I Met Your Mother
so as for the tapestry tent I got the
tapestry off Etsy and I'm just using
wolf or thumbtacks and I'm using about
two or three and pinning them up at the
top and then along the sides to make a
little tent and then I just put a little
rug in some pillows inside as well as a
blanket and this is just a really easy
way to turn a corner in your room or in
your living room or anywhere you live
into a little reading connect or a
little place to go hang out and I'm
planning on stringing some Christmas
lights as well just to make it more cozy
and then of course other than that we
just kind of hung out for the rest of
the night and watched movies like spy
kids or music videos like of course
Taylor Swift's and she's also obsessed
and that was pretty much the whole day I
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
