yeah I'm just so happy to just end it
good morning guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm doing
another vlog with you guys welcome back
to the 12 days of Kanis last night I
actually got back from LA I just woke up
this morning and I am like punched in
the face with this cold like my throat
my eyes were like oozing all morning it
was great my ears are pop so I can't
fully here and just my entire existence
is struggling right now so hard also to
go make coffee and I had none it was
just it's been a very upsetting morning
I have a few things to get done in terms
of work before I actually had to
Kingston so in this vlog and wouldn't be
heading to my hometown we're having an
early Christmas that are there so that's
kind of the plan so far and a whiteness
eat Bentley and pick him up I feel like
I should be leaving relatively soon I'm
skipping my workout for the day because
there's just no way if I work out I'm
just gonna make it worse I want to try
and leave soon but I feel so crappy that
I don't know if I should try and see if
I feel better by the afternoon
regardless of what I do I'm gonna have
to definitely find a coffee soon it is
the season I love winter but this is the
one thing I hate about winter is that I
actually feel like I was punched in the
face by a cold this happens to me every
time I travel every time I come back
from anywhere I tend to get sick does
that happen to you guys because I swear
I could you know I every time I get back
from anywhere minute I get off that
plane I'm like all bets are off
well with that said welcome back to my
channel it's gonna be a fun vlog we're
gonna nurse this back to health
maybe I'll need to go pick up some
Starbucks some medicine pack up my bag
for king
and hit the road let's be good starting
with cough syrup
yes I found unto this bad boys out and
my old bag moved here
you've got the head you can side
is leaking out all over my skin every
time that I get close to you making me
weak with the way you flip through those
eyes but all I see is your face all I
need is yours
wake me up witty your lives come at me
from up above
yeah oh I named you
I remember the way that you you dancing
easily through my dreams
it's healing me harder and harder with
all your smiles
you crazy gentle Bentley
oh I see
baby I need you to send me in the way I
see
love sleep
in the middle of my train
oh I sees no face I need is your so I am
finally home I'm so freakin sick
I feel like based on what I've logged I
probably seen like the shortest chip
home ever but I was actually there for
two nights so freaking sneck said he
just wanted to get home and in a video
that's going up today and then just
literally just you know when you're sick
and you just need to be at home that's
the feeling I had today so I just wanted
to like cuddle up with Bentley on my
couch edit today's video get it up and
then just literally drink soup and chill
out so that is why I'm already back and
like my head's really hot let's get real
TMI for a second here they're like lime
green like my snot is lime green which
would I love that up meatza
my body's fighting an infection or I
even edit I'm gonna take a really hot
shower and just like burn it off
anything any infection on the outside
that way body gonna burn off with hot
water so the first thing I like to do
when I'm really sick is definitely take
like a hot bath or a hot shower it's
needed I just wanna know you I just
wanna be a party arrived
all my broken bridges are up again and
everything's fine
how do you know they're broke hello my
voice is a little better today the
things that I've been doing have been
actually helping and I feel like I'm at
the beginning of the end of my sickness
so I feel like it's slowly starting to
go away aside from taking a hot shower
the other things that I love to do what
I'm sick or when it comes to my sick
routine is also making soup now I showed
you guys that I got hot and sour Tommy
I'm super last night it's like from this
vegan place in Toronto it's actually
called say call notice and it is amazing
it's like almost entirely vegan so
that's really good and so I got that
last night ended up adding some spice to
it so that's the other thing is if you
can eat spicy because it'll make you
have like a runny nose and as bad as it
sounds but like having already knows
it's a good thing because it's getting
it out of your systems when you get
blocked up that's when you get headaches
and congestion don't cuddle with me
please don't leave me at set tonight I'm
gonna be making my own version of the
soup this is the soup that I like to
make whenever I get sick if you guys
want I can upload the recipe to my blog
chicken noodle soup but a vegan version
I use tofu instead and a bit of rice
noodles um if you guys want that recipe
just let me know and I will post it on
my blog I would part up my sick routine
is as I you get to the end of feeling
sick I like to exercise to try and like
sweat it out of my system now this isn't
going to work for everybody and like
yesterday there's no way in hell I could
have exercised oh hello you've come back
to join us yesterday there's absolutely
no way I could have exercised my body
was just too drained and like tired like
even my muscles just felt icky but today
I woke up first of all I didn't wake up
through the night I didn't have a runny
nose this morning and I woke up with my
muscles not feeling achy anymore so I
decided to sweat it out and try and work
out a little bit just to kind of kind of
kickstart my immune system a little bit
and just get blood pumping so do this
one with caution I would say only if you
feel yourself getting sick or towards
the end of being sick would I work out
and also be sure that if you are gonna
work out to only work out on about 75%
of what you usually do so lately I've
been running like 7 to 8 kilometers so
instead today I just did a quick 5k
because you also don't want to put
yourself back into feeling sick
when it comes to being sick and outfits
this is pretty much my go-to I bring
hats when I'm sick solely for the fact
that one my hair is a hot mess too
I go through like hot and cold phases so
it's easy to take it off and put it back
on and then I also just like to wear
sweaters and shorts the reason why I do
this is because it's the perfect
combination of hot will hold my sweaters
from Tignes make shorts are from Lulu
and then my slippers are from Victoria's
Secret and I feel like this is perfect
because if I get a little chilly these
shorts are tight so I can just throw it
pants over top and if I get a little hot
I can take the sweat pants off and just
wear the shorts and then I'm the perfect
combination of hot and cold when I was
just in Kingston I actually wore a black
hat just like this the whole weekend cuz
I was so sick at my Christmas dinner
it really stopped but I just wore a hat
the sweater the whole time and I was so
comfy and just like cozy even though I
fell asleep everywhere I sat down which
also reminds me to bring hand sanitizer
everywhere you go if you have to venture
out from home so like I said this
weekend I was obviously in my hometown
so I have my little hand sanitizer with
me in my bag or like in my pocket at all
times just so that one I'm sanitize it's
all bit more safe but - I'm not making
anyone around me sick and if you're
really really sick and just chilling at
home like I'm gonna be for the rest of
today just to kick off whatever is left
of this flu I suggest getting it like a
warm or heated blanket
honestly best purchase I've ever made
Bentley and I both might agree on that I
got my unit blanket from Amazon I think
a year or two ago if I can find a link
I'll leave it down below but if you
don't want to buy a heated blanket or
you don't have a heated blanket and
another thing you can do is just take
normal blankets I would take three to
four pop them in the dryer and then just
warm them up like tumble them for a
couple minutes pull them out and then
literally just world yourself into them
if you take an extra blanket one from
the dryer and stuff it inside of your
Burrow
so basically take one pop like it and
then wrap another bike and around you
that one inside will stay warm or longer
so you can always do that too if you
don't have heated blankets but damn this
heated blanket is like it is a gift when
you are sick like even if you're not
sick and you're just having like really
bad cramps or whatever it is these
heated blankets are just oh and on top
of the heat up like it I like to light
some unscented candles so that it
doesn't mess up my nose or make me
sneeze any more than i absolutely have
to some good sick movies which probably
some of my favorites would be anything
like
like Toy Story or any of those those are
like might go twos what I'm sick it just
reminds me of being a kid you know and
last but not least because I don't like
it makes me anxious when I'm not being
productive or efficient another thing I
like to do when I'm sick is little
sit-down tasks that I always
procrastinate what I'm not sick so for
instance clearing off some storage on my
phone like deleting old photos patching
up on books that you want to read or
just catching up on reading in general
because since you're sick nobody can
stop you from reading all the books you
want I remember when I had mono in high
school I finished all the twilights in
like three days it was actually amazing
anything like that that doesn't require
you to actually move and doesn't require
much brain capacity but you're just
sitting around being sick and you're
getting a little stir-crazy from
watching so much TV there's little tiny
things you can do like that like making
even to-do lists or some ideas of things
you want to do when you're not sick
anymore things like that that just
require you to be sitting down those are
like my go-to tasks whenever I'm sick so
that I'm still somehow remaining
productive don't feel like you have to
do that you can also just sleep and be a
normal citizen and with that I hope you

camus sorry I was so sick and it was
