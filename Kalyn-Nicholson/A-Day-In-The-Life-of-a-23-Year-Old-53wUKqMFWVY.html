hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm doing a
day in the life video it's only because
it was something that was been requested
on both my morning routine and my night
routine was not to just vlog kind of
like my morning or my night but actually
take you guys through a full day so for
today I'm giving you guys a complete
peek at what a day in my life kind of
looks like I mean everyday is never the
same it's always kind of different but
today is Friday so it's gonna be a fun
kind of day to film a day in my life I
figured would be good one and also today
was a little different too because I
stayed at Gregg's last night so when I
woke up I obviously wasn't at home
okay Benny wanna go for a drive
you know for driving I go home go home
oh you see this head off my camera okay
let's go let's go
and that's kind of sending my day off a
little bit later than usual but anytime
I sleep at his house I kind of already
know that's gonna happen it takes me
like 45 minutes to drive home B just
because of early morning traffic in
Toronto something I've been doing
recently though and it's something that
I actually started because I was waking
up and just kind of feeling just so
anxious in the mornings for some reason
instead of waking up and just like going
at my to-do list right away I decided to
start reading in the morning come in
this habit that have like honestly grown
obsessed with I'm reading a fiction and
a nonfiction at the same time so when I
wake up and read a chapter of a fiction
book it's kind of like you know you're
still dreaming because you're in another
world and then I read my nonfiction
which just kind of sets my intention for
the day because it's always something
like you're learning something and
you're gaining some knowledge and I just
feel like it's such a good way to go
into my day I actually just finished
this book this morning I just finished
reading wanderlust I had two chapters
left so instead of reading one chapter
this morning I figured screw it were
already running late so let's just
finish off the whole book it's such a
bittersweet feeling finishing a book I
fall in love with fictional characters
I'm sad that this one's over I'd
probably read it I want to say like
three and a half or a four out of five
stars it wasn't like one of those things
where you're reading it like JK Rowling
and her writing is just rich not that
this was poorly written by any means but
I just stay ke Rowling and so many other
authors they just set the bar so high so
that's why I give this a 4 I like it
because it's about traveling there's a
really cute kind of love story in it and
it's just the characters in general
there's like little senior citizens in
it and they're just so cute definitely
recommend if you guys are looking for a
new fictional book to pick this up and
then I read a chapter of sacred powers
I'm about more than halfway through this
one honestly this one I'm really
stretching it out because I'm so in love
with it that I don't want it to end like
its honestly changing my life so now
that my reading is done I'm gonna go
update my Goodreads I have to charge my
camera a little bit so that we can
continue our day in the life I think I'm
gonna do some meditation and some yoga
today's a bit more of a chill workday so
I have more time to kind of be a little
bit flexible with the things that I do
today I want to try and get a run in and
then I have to edit a video but either
way I've grabbed a mug
take a seat stay a while and
welcome to a day in my life that I speak
the things I have to do for work include
editing a video that goes live at next
week like it normally takes me anywhere
from five to sometimes eight hours to
edit a video depending on what the video
is I think today I might be able to
crunch this video up nice and quick
because I've already started editing it
so lately what I like to do for projects
like editing videos or anything that
takes kind of more than I would say
three hours I like to do this thing
where I will punch in a timer on my
phone work for that block of time and
then as soon as the timer goes off I'll
give myself 15 minutes to do a smaller
task for the day whether it's like I
don't even know like I have to go pick
up parcels or if I need to go grab
groceries for dinner tonight
taking Bentley for a walk little like
smaller tasks like that to break up the
bigger tasks so I'm gonna put an hour
timer on my phone right now work on this
video for an hour and then once the
hours up I'll break it up with doing
something else and then get back to
editing it again sitting here with a cup
of coffee and my laptop and my dog you
guys really are getting a true look at a
day in my life hands go
okay one hour down I actually got a lot
done put around a bit I have some
cleaning up to do I have a couple of
things I need to do in like my my office
space basically I'm gonna use this time
to give my brain just a tiny bit of a
break to help with my productivity
I can we know there's no turning
Matthew
turn your place
said and done it maybe along
on the inside
it's hard to breathe I'm not used to it
I can we know this man drive you
hello I'm just uploading my video I
actually just finished it a few minutes
ago okay I'm officially not working out
today what else okay so I'll see you
you're gonna be here in 30 they say
stuffed eggplant I'm gonna assume that
means there's cheese in there and like I
want to do that dates kills her camera
died my camera did die it almost broke
would you like to see yourself Oh hot
good luck it's so kilns camera died this
is how she talks when she's blogging I'm
just trying to you know replicate her to
her style here and we ordered a Greek
food it looks great no cheese no feta
and I love sticky she can't eat sticky
sexpert whose live updates from Greg now
you guys know all the updates my camera
did sigh but I actually finished editing
I feel like this is so close to me I
need my tripod so I actually finished
editing my vlog just in time for Gregory
to call me I just showered really quick
so that we can eat unfortunately we were
gonna try and go to Hawaii which is
something that you guys will see in my
plan with me video I kind of throw it
like I write on my calendar that we're
gonna be in Hawaii but unfortunately
with flights and stuff it just ended up
not working out so instead we're gonna
try and see if there's somewhere else we
can literally jump a plane to in less
than a week for my birthday I figured
out your finger it's gonna be good time
I guess a lot you guys know if we end up
booking your trip somewhere and you're
probably hungry too dude he's gonna have
his so anyway let's eat food let's do it
freely yeah we may have just found a
place to have I'll taste brilliance
thanks babe
well hello there to you too so it's now
officially Saturday I didn't end up
filming and I would show to this video
so I figured I would update you guys on
the recent events that you missed Greg
and I literally ended up hunting all
night I think we may have found
somewhere that we can swing to go away
from my birthday it happens it happens
I'm not gonna stress about it
I also just realized I did not plug
these lights in that's better but aside
from that we ended up doing that so I'm
not kidding you like midnight and then
crash look up today I've got some work
done that went was my friend cat and her
friends and then I just stepped back and
realized that I had no church in this
video I'm not gonna lie guys I've had a
few mimosas back in January I crossed
over one full year of living here in
Toronto and so in general I've just been
kind of pushing myself to get outside
more to go see more of Toronto just to
go explore more places try more vegan
restaurants break that winter
hibernation I guess you could say
I mean since this is a Dana life I guess
we'll kind of update you guys as to
where I feel like my life is kind of at
this year I've been taking my goals more
seriously even just reading more reading
my books more doing meditation doing
more yoga running like everything in
general I feel like my life has created
such a shift and in such a non sappy way
there are so many things that I want to
do and there's so many things I want to
see and there's so many things I want to
accomplish everything in my life has
kind of clicked into place I'm so
excited to see what else to see your
holes like I said I'm a few mimosas deep
but I'm feeling really I'm feeling all
the feels guys and I got to throwing in
the fact that I turned 24 this week and
I can't even begin to think of what 24
might have waiting around the corner and
of course I'll I'll continue to document
it via mp4 literally no better way I
would like to be spending my life thank
you guys so much for making 23 my
favorite year and just the ability to do
what I do it honestly is it dumb found
me I sometimes can't even think about it
because I'm afraid that if I touch it
it'll break and I hope that even if it
just helps one person feel the same way
that you guys make me feel that's all I
would care about at the end of the day
because I think everybody deserves to be
happy everybody deserves to feel that
connection of everything feeling like
it's exactly where it needs to be and 23
for me really put that into focus I hope
you guys enjoyed this little day and the
light I've been playing around with the
idea of doing like a work week in my
life and just kind of vlogging my entire
work we get a glance to give you guys a
chance to see what that kind of likes
like so if you guys want to see that
definitely let me know also I'm gonna
leave my meditation playlist down below
I just released it literally minutes ago
and
not will see all of you guys on
Wednesday we're gonna put your paw over
the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
