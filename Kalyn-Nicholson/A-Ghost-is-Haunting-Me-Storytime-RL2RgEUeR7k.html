I'm wearing my skull sweater because I
figured it was just appropriate
can you guys hear that that would be the
sound we would hear in the middle of the
night hey everyone and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm doing
my first ever storytime I don't think
I've ever done a story time video before
it's so much like a coffee talk grab
your coffee or your tea and let's get to
story time
I guess I'm new to this so where do I
even begin let's go back to when I was a
kid okay
so growing up my siblings and I were
always convinced that there was ghosts
in her house no matter where we lived we
always heard the same sounds in the
middle of the night one of them being
the sound of like footsteps on carpet
the other one being that pots and pans
would clash and wake us up there's just
one of those things that you never
wanted to wake up in the middle of the
night at my house because you would hear
something and I'm gonna see if I can do
this sound like can you guys hear that
that would be the sound we would hear
okay so now let's fast forward it to
last year I don't know if you guys
remember my old apartment I'll put some
clips in here showing you guys the place
I lived prior to living in this
apartment now I lived with my best
friend Maggie we lived downtown in my
hometown which my own town is super
historical it's been here for a very
very long time so the house that we
lived in was actually built in the 1800s
which we thought was really cool it had
so much character like the wood floors
were like original wood floors they were
creaky the whole house was lopsided
practically falling apart but it was
right downtown so typically when we
moved in we knew that this house had
been around for a very long time and
both Maggie and I are very superstitious
people so we were like minced no matter
what before we even went into this house
we were like there's spirits here maybe
we can all get along and live here you
know what I mean like whoever's here
we're not gonna ask you to pay rent
considering we're imposing on your space
cuz you know don't kill me in the night
that's all I ask
there was like a bunch of little things
that would happen that we were kind of
spooked about but didn't think anything
of until we were in the
and Bentley was with us and he was
sitting with us on the couch and it had
gotten late we decided that we weren't
going to watch any more TV I'm pretty
sure we were watching alien
documentaries too which is probably why
we were already on edge so we came out
of our living room which was attached to
our kitchen and when we came out into
the kitchen something from the hallway
which is on the other side of the
kitchen came flying in hit the wall hit
the chair hit the ground and made like
really loud thuds the whole way so we
stood that really stared at each other
we're like what do we do we go over to
the other side of the counter and
Bentley's dog toy it was like his call
me or whatever had been chucked in and
Maggie had walked out first so she had
seen it come in like it came in hi it
wasn't like it just rolled into the
kitchen it came in like it caught air
someone through that and it was coming
from a completely different direction
from where both of us were standing like
sided to let it go and we went to bed I
don't know how but we did one time we
were sitting on the bench and we're just
like talking and the bar table was right
beside us and we looked down and
underneath our bench was like the
ventilation system and it was super old
so it had like a caged thing over top of
it and from underneath the vent there
was just a Barbie's head sticking out
half the hair was like chopped like it
was missing an arm and one of those
things we were just like in such a deep
conversation I just looked down and
there was this doll but we decided to
brush that one off thinking like you
know what maybe Bentley saw it under
there and pulled it out I was upstairs
in my room the one night and it was my
bedroom was in the upstairs like the top
floor of the whole house and my closet
was technically the Attic I was upstairs
I was laying in bed all the windows were
shy on my door I had on my robes hanging
and it was nowhere even near a window to
begin with but I feel like I should just
you know clarify that none of the
windows were open and I'm laying there
and I'm watching how I Met Your Mother
and I'm just enjoying my grand old time
and I see some movement and I'm like oh
that's weird and I look at the door and
on the back of my door where my robes
are only one string from my robe was
rocking back and forth to the point that
I took a video and sent it to Maggie who
was downstairs and was like I am not
moving from my bed bonzer I probably
already knows I'm here but
don't want to let it know that I know
it's here and then I'm pretty sure it
was the following night if not one of
the nights that same week that I went
upstairs and went into my closet in my
closet on the roof the roof started to
slant towards the back of my closet so
great where it started to slit there was
like a spot almost looked like there was
like a bit of smoke that went up and
left that residue and it were fingertips
like traced through with fingertips of
like a child that freaked me out because
that was like first of all where did
that smoke come from and neither of us
had hands small enough to make the mark
it was in the Attic it was in the Attic
of the house of the old 1800 like stone
creaky floor like lopsided haunted house
a dripping coffee older myself
psy seemed super hyped about the story
it's also because this is my fourth
coffee today also a night that Maggie
was out of town and I was there by
myself and I was upstairs and I heard
the loudest bang I actually thought
Maggie had come home and was upset and
went into a room and slammed her door
that's how loud it was so I go to the
top of the stairs and I yell down for
Maggie I'm like did she come home this
weekend she's not supposed to be here
and there's no answer so I call Maggie
and I'm like hey where are you and she's
like I'm at home I'm not there stay on
the phone with me I'm going to
investigate and I go downstairs and in
our kitchen we had these cupboards we
have like normal cupboards and then we
had two sets of cupboards that were
there from when the house was originally
built they were like super old old old
cupboards the left one Maggs put her
food in the right one I put my food in I
go downstairs and the right cupboard is
open it wasn't like it open and some
things fell out no it was open and every
single thing and all of my shelves was
on the floor
I had like potatoes in there cereal cans
of soup cans of like food I had packaged
food was all on the ground that's not a
coincidence there's no way all of those
cans fell off the top shelf and
everything fell off the bottom shelf it
just didn't it didn't make sense and
then probably one of the last and like
scariest things that happened to us
there was January of this year Maggie
and I went to go see a concert in
Toronto we went to go see a wonder so we
were both away for the weekend we got
back from our weekend away
I dropped Maggie off and I went back to
the apartment and when I opened the door
I
I heard TV and I was like oh that's
weird it's probably the girl from
downstairs walked up the stairs and our
TV from our living room was on full
blast so I call Maggie I'm at the top of
the stairs of the bottom set of stairs
at this point I'm like I'm gonna go turn
off the TV but I'm convinced someone
might be here there was like some sort
of ghost thing going on and the other
one wasn't there we called it was like
you stay on the phone with me that we
have I die you call 9-1-1 but i go into
the kitchen to go to the living room to
turn off the TV and when i go into the
kitchen we had like a gallery wall full
of photos and like three of them were
tilted sideways like completely tilted
thoth them back normal turn off the TV
and I'm like alright I'm good now
there's nobody here I'm gonna get off
the phone I go upstairs and all of the
doors in the upstairs level were slam
shut and that doesn't sound creepy but
we never shut the doors in our apartment
I left the closet door open I left my
office door open I left my bedroom door
open - I had to like slam them hard to
get them to shut and they were all shut
on top of the fact that the TV was
blaring and our pictures were like all
sideways that's not okay
so those were like the gist of the
scariest things that I would say happen
fast forward to moving out into this
apartment and I'm thinking like this
apartments more up to date it's
definitely more like it's not from the
1800s and so I'm like okay cool I'm not
gonna be haunting anymore no I'm pretty
sure that whatever goes to was or
another ghost at least is here now if
you followed me
or maybe it's friend decided to you know
take residence here so for the first few
months of living here absolutely nothing
happened I was like okay I got rid of
the ghost one night I'm watching TV and
my xbox just magically turns off which
I'm thinking okay maybe it's just its
glitch once a week now it'll randomly
turn on on itself it'll randomly turn
off on itself to turn it on my xbox it's
like a touch screen you have to go up
and touch the little thing to get it to
turn on I'm open up twice now in the
middle of the night to my bedroom lights
being on and my TV on full-blast
probably in this room right now
listening to me tell you guys a story
laughing just the butt of all of his
jokes yeah that's it that's the whole
story of why I'm haunted I swear to god
I am haunted the freakier parts
definitely happened in our old apartment
but I swear to god it followed me here
maybe you guys don't believe in this to
be honest I don't even know if
i 100% believe in ghosts like to each
their own and i will tell you in the
last year and a half i believe in them a
lot more than i ever used to this is no
longer you know the sound of footsteps
on carpet this is like he's turning on
my lights and wanting to watch TV so
that concludes my ghost story I hope you
guys enjoyed if you guys have any ghost
stories or if you guys are convinced
that you guys are being haunted let me
know down below I'm actually very
curious to know whether or not any of
you guys believe in ghosts maybe if your
ghost is single and my ghost is single
we can like hook them up and they'll be
so busy with each other that they'll
leave us alone so I love you guys to the
back I hope you guys enjoyed this first
ever storytime and I'll see you guys all
in tomorrow's video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
