person that drinks alone should I be
concerned a company that is actually
like this event is for tonight all the
Santa Margarita we want to cook this and
drink it I don't actually know fully how
to use one of these we think with the
amount of wine that I drank in my
lifetime probably sign here I speak like
I graduated Oxford and if you're
questioning and if you're not sure okay
I got sometimes
we can talk more Wow
guess who's here pretty good again it's
pretty good wine basically we're gonna
go and then we're gonna order vegan
pizza and race back here to watch Game

right now tell them we're gonna agre the
Art Gallery of Ontario you haven't been
there you'll take it in I think I've
been to the Art Gallery of Ontario you
like the seventh grade yes Chuck because
you can't fire on my oxides
what's your performance do you like rap
a lot more whatever that you like I got
it all for you somebody who forgot a lot
so what you wanna go really can but then
more importantly we came home we got
pizza and we watched Game of Thrones god
bless america
then we are now back with pizza mmm
Game of Thrones and Don Jerry ice cream
priorities and now we're about to put on
another episode while I get some work
done but Greg's gonna watch it on the
couch and be a little lazy but just
kidding so he works really already has
the morning off for once which is a
change first we're gonna make him
breakfast
it is currently Sunday September 10th I
caught up super early this morning and
filled it a bunch more orders then Greg
woke up and join editing the vlog that
goes live today because like I said it's
Sunday no he's here reveal my reveal
okay if you guys didn't watch last
week's vlog I highly suggest you do
otherwise you might not understand what
this reveal is I might know by now that
I lost a bet and I had to cook Greg
dinner you know it was a busy day I was
just falling I was falling a little bit
behind I was in a bit of a rush yes and
it's coming next and there's a secret
that we had in that blog he wanted me to
make him cookies today I didn't have any
time to do it we're gonna trick him
I bought some cookies I'm gonna put them
on a platter and make it look like I
baked that and it'll just be our little
secret you won't you won't have to no
I'm even gonna put them on a pan and
warm them up in the oven so the whole
place smells like cookies
and I realized with editing we never
revealed the secret to Greg now that I'm
editing in front of you you're gonna see
it either way you don't mean just let's
show you good the cookies were good I'm
glad exactly
you buy the whatever you want police saw
that things appear and didn't put two
and two together this is what he saw
tomorrow we're going to the Toronto Film
Festival which I'm going to vlog with
you guys too so you're in for a treat
nope what's up guys it's now Monday I
spent so much time doing labeling and
packaging aka I didn't really have much
to vlog with you guys but we're picking
it up right where we left actually
Monday afternoon I just got finished
filming some videos I actually just
packed up a bag I'm heading it to the
Toronto International Film Festival
tonight I'm going this Greg we got
invited by the L'Oreal team to go with
them and then they even put us up in a
hotel room for the night which we were
like you know what yeah we'll take that
and I called to make sure I can bring
Bentley and everything so I packed an
overnight bag it's like a little mini in
town getaway but still super fun also
some other really exciting stuff look
what came today the new Co sweaters I
designed came today you guys can see
there's like a little mug in the back
how cute is it that is the coast sweater
that's gonna be going up on COEs this
week it'll be up on Wednesday by the
time you guys see this it'll already be
live but I'm freaking obsessed I'm gonna
wear this all the time it's so comfy to
like the arms are so baggy but the the
crop is really short and if you guys are
curious I'm wearing a size small an idea
of how it fits so it's like it's pretty
highly cropped like these are
high-waisted pants they are really
shortly cropped just to forewarn you
guys but I'm so frickin obsessed and
when I head out today I'm actually gonna
wear my new sunglasses that I got from
COEs - and these ones come in four
different colors I decided to get the
orange ones for myself because I feel
like they're so fall festive I'm gonna
finish packing up my little over
bag which is back there and we're gonna
head to Shana Film Fest hopefully Greg
is gonna make it on time
okay so I'm officially heading to tip
Greg's running super behind so we're
gonna figure out what we can do about
that if I'm gonna wait here for him or
if he's gonna meet us we're not exactly
sure but we're figuring you know I
started to wait for Greg to get here and
we hire in the tightest
time crunch we have 20 minutes I texted
Jessica she's the girl that coordinated
this and I was like all right not here
from work yet but we're gonna run and
she's like kay but the movie starts at
6:00 and I was like it's 5:30 we've got
20 minutes to make it Greg's don't not
here yet but in the meantime somebody
else is enjoying himself why do you
always cuddle yourself up in the cutest
ways I mean I'm hoping this vlog the
next clip is me saying that we made it
not gonna lie I'm finishing up this wine
waiting for someone why not just get a
little bit DEP saying you know as I
should drunk vlog with you guys if you
like would be really funny also knowing
that we're hopefully potentially going
to make it does anybody else take like
what they leave on TV for their dog very
seriously because I do I'm like flipping
through all these channels and I'm like
dogs are very susceptible to things I
want to make sure he's watching
something that's inspiring but also
doesn't like shelter him from the world
you know definitely not the news nope
not happening
guilty pleasure I'm gonna leave dr. Phil
on Bentley you need to be a good Boulder
I think Greg's here
so Eugene the Greg
good morning we saw the movie breeze at
10
the movie was 10 we saw the movie breed
and then we went to Figo for dinner
which was great it's really good what
are you doing
every time I vlog it catch Bentley doing
the weirdest things up yeah because it's
a freakin 10:00 a.m. so we're gonna run
down to the hotel breakfast because it's
free breakfast here which is a the bomb
and then we're gonna walk to Starbucks
so I can get a latte and we can walk
Bensley
and then I'm gonna get going with my day
I have some things to do which I'm gonna
bring you guys along with me so let's go
get some breakfast know if some caffeine
darling caffeine darling the school
it's later in the afternoon that I last
vlogs it's about 2:30 I'm just waiting
for a Greg to get in the Jeep I'm here
to pick them up because they're gonna go
check out a shipping facility which
means that to those of you guys who got
the first few orders of coasts up until
now I've been shipping them all up
myself which is great and fun and I love
being so hands-on and I wish I could
stay that way but also for the sake that
a lot of you guys obviously want your
things faster like you guys want them
shipped to you guys faster and also just
means of giving myself a bit of a life
at nighttime
I'm looking into actually getting things
shipped out from an actual third-party
shipping that's gonna mean that anytime
someone orders from coast it could take
days to get to you guys I don't even
know if he knows I'm here there he is
okay that's kind of the plan I'm still
calling him but many things going on I
like your sweater ready to go check out
this shipping place let's do it
we the to finance human evolution so
much of table
so I actually just got back from
grabbing sushi with Kat things went
really well with that shipping company
today just so you guys know so some big
and exciting things are gonna be
happening for Co soon some more
professional and established things like
this has just been an ongoing thing in
this vlog is catching about me doing
weird things here there you are the
thinking cutest thing I'm gonna ship out
everything that I have is inventory left
but anything new coming to codes after
this like all the new stuff that I'm
gonna be ordering like like for instance
I really wanted to design a you tober
mug and things like that those will all
be just being shipped out from this
shipping company which means shipping is
gonna be it's so much faster there's
gonna be tracking numbers people are
gonna be able to track their packages
plus it's also gonna make it so I can
stock more things on the store basically
a lot of really boring business talk but
I'm just really excited another thing
too that I was talking about with Kat I
honestly jokingly tweeted out not too
long ago being like it'd be so fun to
throw a Harry Potter Meetup where we all
dress in our in our houses and we drink
butter beer guys I'm eight I might make
that happen
you guys aren't following my social
media be sure to because that is where
you're gonna get the fastest updates on
this happening basically what I'm
thinking is I need to get in contact
with a few venues I'm looking to do it
October the 13th so Friday the 13th and
it would be here in Toronto I'm gonna
sell a certain amount of tickets and
then once the tickets are sold out
that's gonna be it because I'm gonna
have to have a max amount of people that
can come it would be sick I just don't
know if anyone would come and you guys
pretty much said like I'll come so I'll
plan it if you guys will come to it so
I'm contacting a bunch of venues
tomorrow and cats actually gonna help me
basically throw this event there might
be a Harry Potter meetup in our near
future and I might dress Bentley as
Dobby there's just so much going on
right now I'm just so I could turn into
a much crazy I'm different my life feels
now as opposed to last year and I'm not
saying that I had a bad year last year
actually I kind of did I'm a bad year
last year not only just like happy but
just content I feel like I have a sense
of home oh like I'm stressed out don't
get me wrong I'm stressed out but I am
like the happiest dressed person on the
planet right now summing this all up I
guess what I'm trying to get at nothing
is forever you
have to enjoy the moments that are
happening right in front of you despite
how stressful you are despite how big
your to-do list is have to still enjoy
the moments that are right in front of
you and that are still happening because
they're not gonna be here forever Jenny
when they enjoy each stage of your life
as it's happening or else they'll all
just pass you by no matter how stressed
you feel no matter how much you need to
do no matter how worried you are enjoy
the phase of your life that's happening
right now and find the things in it that
are still like there's still so many
reasons to be happy there's still so
many reasons to be grateful and I think
that that's the trick to being happy all
the time
because there's always gonna be problems
there's always gonna be stressed there's
always gonna be to do and enjoy the
process of that it's all leading to and
I just feel like that might be the key
to like enjoying every day of your life
so that is it I hope you guys enjoyed
today's vlog I'm sorry if it was all
over the place I love you guys see you
in the back thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys all on
Tuesday ah put your body here like me
