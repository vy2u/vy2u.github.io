channel for today's video I'm doing
another coffee conical z' with you guys
as I'm sure you already know from the
title I just woke up from a nap like 20
minutes ago so my energy is piqued it's
actually 5:00 p.m. right now I'm about
to head to pick up my friend Larissa
it's Labor Day not looper day Victoria
day it's Victoria day so everything
today is closed everything I've tried to
do today I've completely failed that I
went to go grab groceries grocery stores
closed went to this other store that's
in my area thinking that they would have
produce they were out went to go do like
this shipping label thing today and it
won't give me my password I tried to
call to get my password they were closed
ah lost some footage today it's just
it's been it's been one of those Mondays
you know so I decided to just kind of
take it easy do some other stuff that I
could get done today then I took a nap
which made me feel hella not better and
I did some yoga which helped as well and
now I'm gonna go pick up Larissa the
grocery store buy her is open and we're
gonna grab some stuff and do a barbecue
cuz it's super nice so I mean you can't
really tell right now but it's like 20
degrees which is pretty warm for those
of you in Fahrenheit I'll pop that up on
the screen there aren't denote the
barbecue because um you know summer

stuff to do which we'll be doing in this
vlog so with that sad let's go grab
Larissa let's grab it some cauliflower
so we can make cauliflower steaks and
let's let's head up a Barbie Oh light up
the ball back up the ball there I don't
know
summer things
you
say I didn't give you guys a purple
update yesterday and I deeply apologize
there really wasn't much going on to be
honest there's a coffee chronicles going
up today that's like a weekend in the
city but it's just like it's so fun like
playing around with the footage and
seeing what I end up with because every
day I'm vlogging something a little
different
yesterday we hit up a new cafe page one
was pretty good
I left a review of that cafe on my
Instagram I know that I'm never gonna
not love coffee it's oh I've been
forcing myself to venture out especially
now that the weather is nicer I feel
like it's so important to get out so
whether I'm meeting up with a friend or
not I've been trying to try out a new
cafe like once a week today is a little
bit more of a like boring adult and
tasks kind of day but I'm trying to make
it fun I have to go get in the way I'll
change my Jeep is so overdue for an oil
change
while my Jeep is getting the oil change
I looked it up and there's a Starbucks
really close to there so I think I'm
just gonna bring my laptop and do some
work after today it's gonna be basically
meet-up mode because I am like a little
nervous but like super excited for the
rest of this weekend I'm only I can just
like focus on the meet-up and a pack up
so I want a jacket get Jersey to Midas
for a little oil change and get on today
there's like an airport right there
those streets behind me so it's a little
bit loud so first time in a little bit I
feel that I've meditated outside as
opposed to in my apartment this morning
I also finish the book that the measure
of my power is I will either wait to
download an atomic Goodreads and the
month she talks about up with her
anxiety like it was like there was a
street I hate her being in a stream and
or like a current and it's taking you
and it's a really saving you fast and
the thing is is that she talks about how
like she would try and turn around and
swim against it because she felt like
she wasn't ready until finally she just
let go and let her body sink to the
bottom but somehow her head stayed at
the table and then when she finally let
go the stream started to take her and
she
able to just kind of like slip over lay
on her back and almost enjoy the view
and just like let things come to her
because then things she arrived where
she needed to naturally think meditating
saying I was thinking about it and I was
like thinking about all the things I had
to do and it blew minute I wanted to get
anxious I thought of that stream concept
or it's like you know I know like those
things are gonna come those dates are
gonna come the time to do those things
is gonna arrive that other does that
call me then like be freaking out
fighting the stream and then arrive
there and be like all anxious and worked
up and make it out make it worse than it
really needs to be you know a little
meditation say and doing that
now I'm gonna throw on my running shoes
I'm gonna run back home my stop at
Starbucks and grab a latte on the way
home I run back and then walk the rest
away and just enjoy existing which by
the way let me situate myself and we'll
sit down and talk about it oh my where
do I even again I don't even know where
to start
the rock star reached out and they saw
that I'd like talked about it in a video
or or posted to Instagram and offered me
to go and get a tarot reading done by
Jane I went away thank you rob store for
making that happen so we talked a lot
about love and relationships he's also
just like crazy intuitive all about how
I don't trust myself and once I let go
of my fear and myself devil I'm able to
actually harness and I have harnessed it
before but harness that sense of calm
that sense of consciousness that sense
of feeling connected and balanced and
it's so funny so much about balance was
coming through and you guys know like I
started these coffee chronicles
basically being like hi I'm gonna
balance let me document my journey into
life but also trying to like navigate
balance in life throughout the way I was
like I'll see you again she goes you
kind of you up but you know all the
answer is money
Jane come live with me I love you
everything about that was just so I have
I literally anyway I'm just so elated
right now I can't even I can't even
describe it I was talking to you guys
this morning
we were meditating by the park about how
much more clear minded I felt and today
I feel this huge shift and I know that
sounds so cliche and I feel shifts all
the time but today is different today is
a very calm but like energetic shift you
guys are ever in the Toronto area if you
live in Toronto go to the rock store and
go see Jane her energy is just who her
as a person she's so sweet
get up Guzman's she's just she's great
she's good now I'm going to grab
something to eat it's going on for which
might be a little early for dinner but
I'm eating a photographer his name is
Tong all the business trip down below it
is dope I'm meeting him at 8:00 so we're
gonna shoot some photos and stuff so I'm

is gonna be so I definitely I just want
to get there ahead of time I'm gonna
venture out go grab myself a bite to eat

for a little bit and then go shoot some
photos
today it's been a little bit it's been a
little bit of a crazy day the clips you
guys just saw her from me I had to go
get my windshield fixed aside to chips
in it so Jersey took a bit of a hit
recently but that's okay because he's
all fixed up now he's got his oil change
got his windshield fixed and then I head
up chapters bought a few books came back

up with Kat there or grabbing firewood
and basically a bunch of snacks to host
a bonfire we're gonna go over to the
islands I've never been though a bunch
of girls are meeting up over there we're
gonna have a big bonfire so that didn't
