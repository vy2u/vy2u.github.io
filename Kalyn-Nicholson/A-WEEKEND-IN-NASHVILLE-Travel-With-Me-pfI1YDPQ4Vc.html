channel for today's video I'm doing
another vlog with you guys we are
currently in Nashville we got here last
night it was a bit it was a bit of a
struggle to get to Nashville I think we
were supposed to rolling around like 1
p.m. we kind of had an afternoon planned
and then our flight got canceled and
then I got pushed Nashville
and basically long story short we got in
at like 2:00 a.m. last night and missed
all of yesterday which kind of sucked
but we're still gonna make the most out
of it we're here for the weekend we're
just having like a little mini weekend
getaway and we figured Nashville would
be fun we're about to go for brunch this
morning I woke up decently early and
walked over and grabbed some Starbucks
this morning

so freakin nice like honestly I thought
that it didn't get nicer than Canadians

we woke up this morning I'm a little bit
a little bit hungover and I suck at
hangovers but I'm not being as big of a
baby as I usually am and just put on my
very very natural outfit this shirt I
got it from Urban Outfitters the day
before we left
I'm wearing mine you can type in boots I
honestly I feel so Nashville so we're
gonna go get Gregg some barbecue because
that was like the main thing he wanted
to do then we're gonna go get me a vegan
doughnut because that was the main thing
I wanted to do and then we're just gonna
wing it
so either way I'm freaking hungry and
all food so let's go sit inside get you
some barbecue
super delish
Nashville yesterday but the day before
and did phone outro it's a pretty short
little weekend getaway that Greg and I
took but it was so much fun it was so
last-minute if you guys watched my last
vlog my day in the life of a 23 year old
you'll know that we were initially
supposed to go to Hawaii and it was
supposed to be a bit of a longer trip if
things didn't work out and Greg and I
both have such conflicting schedules
they go Tom train take your time Greg
and I have such conflicting schedules
solely because we both kind of in a way
work for ourselves and we're both very
ambitious sometimes troubled to kind of
find the time and for that reason we
didn't have a lot of time to give to a
full blown trip but knew we wanted to go
somewhere so when ye didn't work out and
the flights for Hawaii weren't working
out and it was all coming up so quickly
we just thought screw it let's just go
somewhere that we can get to fast
and spend a good weekend and then come
home I was driving home from my hometown
listening to country music and was like
we should go to Nashville Nashville is a
place warm enough for brunch pants
Nashville has tacos and thus became our
trip being with everything that's going
on with COEs launching on Friday I've
been like nose to paper editing the like
doing just rounds of editing of catcher
and I've also been recording my podcast
I've been doing my blog there's just
been so many things and I knew that this
was gonna
and when I read my yearly horoscope
which sounds super lame but honestly it
was predicted that this is gonna happen
this year that I was going to take on a
lot of different kind of things at once
this year as opposed to last year I feel
like I'm handling it a lot better and
I'm so excited and was so inspired by
all the things I'm working on but Greg
is also working on a lot of things and
he's super busy with that too so this
weekend was such just such a nice like
mini trip mini getaway and I was trying
my best to kind of balance vlogging it
and capturing it but also just kind of
enjoying it I love little weekend
getaways like this and I honestly just
feel so inspired to kind of do this more
often now so now I'm looking into a
possible trip with Bentley to New York
we shall see I also finished reading
safe haven on this trip I literally
finished this like the last few pages of
it as our plane was landing back in
Toronto
I'm officially three books ahead of
schedule for the year for my yearly goal
and now I just started reading Eat Pray
Love I feel like I feel like I'm on the
cusp of a big travel mood this year so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this one and
you enjoyed getting to kind of get a
peek at our weekend in Nashville I'm
slowly but surely easing Greg in to the
vlogging world he said this is like so
not his thing he never makes me feel bad
for whipping out my camera because our
worlds are very different sometimes I
have to give my guy some props because
he not only never makes me feel bad for
it
he's so good at getting the shots that I
need sometimes I feel a little bad for
the people in my life because I'm
constantly just like whipping out
cameras and filming them when they least
expect it as much as I know you guys
want to see more of Greg as much as I
know and I'm trying really hard to kind
of show you guys more of my day to day
life
so it's all learning that balance you
know definitely watch out on Friday if
you didn't know already COEs is gonna be
launching all new merch
we've got just sweaters guys hold on oh
yeah that's a thing there's a coffee mug
back there we've got the espresso
patronum glasses which look identical to
this you these are like my actual
reading glasses I don't know if I even
told you guys this yet

so wise in knowing also the world is so
much more crisp now the espresso patron
glasses literally look identical to this

got new journals it's all happening on
Friday so freaking excited and I
officially have a podcast release date
