channel for today's video I'm going to
be doing another get ready with me in
the zodiac series and today we are doing
Aquarius
their colors blue their flowers orchid
and their lucky numbers are one and
seven being known to have intellectual
power ability to communicate into form
and understand abstract concept love for
the new and avant God with that I
decided to take all of those you know
bits and pieces of Aquarius and pull
together a look that was kind of
inspired by the Aquarius I decided to
use like a waver like a crimper to get
that like you know the symbol of the
wave and pull it into the hair and then
because their element is air I used a
lot of like not earthy colors but very
like neutrals and nudes because I don't
know I don't know why but that just kind
of felt airy to me it kind of came up
with this winter air mermaid I guess you
could say pulling in the water pulling
in the air and pulling in the fact that
it is literally still winter to be
honest I turned out better than I
thought really quick if you guys aren't
following me already I'm gonna pop my
Twitter and my Instagram right here on
the screen as well as my blog my newest
blog posts that went live on Friday are
things to do in the winter time I
actually had the note written up in my
laptop as something to do when there's
nothing to do and so over the last
little bit whenever I have any sort of
free time I kind of went to that list to
try and figure out what I could do with
my spare time that would still be kind
of productive or not aimless and aside
from that if you guys want to get ready
with me for this Aquarius look then just
keep watching oh right
let us begin so starting off with
foundation I'm gonna use the Tarte
double duty Beauty I'm gonna be using
the color light neutral I'm trying the
matte one this is my first time trying
the matte one I tried like the hydrating
one I have an idea of how I'm hoping
this is all gonna turn out I mean it
probably should prime maybe I will so
for a primer I'm just gonna go in quick
with the Too Faced Proactiv nourishing
hangover so this is
the primer that I'm gonna begin with
like the want to feel alive so I tried
magic I feel fine okay so because this
is a little light and by a little I mean
kind of a lot light for my face I'm
going to put a tiny bit of this over top
of it this is just in golden nude it's
the bare minerals bare Pro just to kind
of add a bit of color to my face because
I think this is a little like I'm
looking a little scary a word that I do
that nobody you go through that again no
oh I'll be the greatest
it's Adam
I'm coming
promise so I'm using the Park Avenue
princess chisel palette from Tarte and
this thing has been like my absolute
favorite I use embrace to highlight and
then a princess cut or angle to crease
the everyone kind of has their own
formula for like putting on makeup but
contouring is just like how I finish my
face you know so for brows I'm using the
benefit brow I'm gonna use this to
create I think I kind of want to do
bushy brows again I've been really into
like thickening my brows be like
especially in the winter it makes your
face just seem so defined and you can
kind of get away with more dramatic
brows and on guitar so I'm just gonna
kind of like feather them out and
thicken them up hopefully not make
myself look too terrifying while I put
my Harry Potter audio book back on
to feel fine
at the end was tragic I lost my mind was
so blond
I don't wanna go through that again oh
oh I'm gonna run into
why are that is 1100 bad so now I'm
gonna go in and tight line my waterline
with white eyeliner I feel like I want
to make it pop you know I'm going in
with the Annabelle stay sharp metallic
what colors in the color Snow White oh
my lashes I feel like we might not be
done with the eyes yet I don't know I'm
just like literally making this up as I
go so I'm gonna try to get my lashes as
big as possible biggest thing is that I
want to highlight is the lips but I feel
like throw some fake freckles in there
if there's so many ways we can go with
this because the Aquarius is like the
water-bearer
I just think of like mermaids so I'm
going as mermaidy as possible like a
winter mermaid almost that's kind of
like the theme I'm thinking I don't know
I don't want to go through that again no
oh I'm gonna run into where that is
though the nobody knew through that
again
I'll be the greatest
it's Adam
promise
um
okay so for lips I was trying it so hard
to find that there's this color by bite
but it's like a dark blue that's almost
black and I was trying to find it
everywhere
I've given up and I've moved over I
tried out like a million different
colors but I finally settled on I'm
gonna try anyway tarot by bite it's like
this purple one I don't know if it's
gonna look as good as I pictured the
blue in my mind but we're gonna get to
try okay it's a little different it's
very different I think you know what
kind of fun okay so while I dig the
purple I think I'm gonna go over it with
the NYX lingerie this is in the color
teddy that totally fixed it and you did
more of like a brown purple I'm content
since returning Aquarius even though
their element is air they are considered
like their symbol as the Water Bearer so
I feel like that's why I kind of had
this idea of a winter mermaid their
symbol is also almost like a wave I had
two guys I had one of these in high
school and I went through such a phase
it was thinner than this one so it was
like even more crimped this one I feel
like it's gonna get brick really nice
and mermaidy waves
I literally just grabbed it off of
Amazon and plus the color is amazing I
never cease to get joy from the fact
that there's a dog park in front of this
window at least fifteen dogs running
back and forth behind the camera it's
amazing I haven't done this in so long I
hope you remember exactly how to I'm
like trying to race through Harry Potter
right now just why I'm listening to the
audiobook in-between talking to you guys
the order of the Phoenix I have to say I
think it's been my favorite book so far
the Prisoner of Azkaban was high up
there too but I loved I guess cuz this
one so long like so much happens in it
and I'm like so close to being finished
and getting excited to move on to my
second fiction book of the year because
it's February I'm thinking I want to
read like a Nicholas Sparks book like
you know not something so like fantasy
or dystopian even I kind of want to read
like a love story the mood I'm feeling
probably the Valentine's Day I'm gonna
spray some heat protectant in my
and then I'm just gonna crimp it with
this crimper I'm really excited since
this is the bottom layer I'm not gonna
crimp it very high to the top to keep
some length so I'm probably gonna start
it like at my shoulder high school me
would be so happy you know
who knew police
poor nothing in the world I would let
this moon
escape for me no one's gonna take it
away from me for nothing and no okay so
this thing is amazing the only thing is
because I'm awkwardly growing out my
bangs right now I'm gonna have to find a
way to pin them back like to twist
righty and that's just the way the
cookie crumbles my friends okay I think
I might use this crimper every day for
the rest of my life this is so fun so as
for my Aquarius of it the bodysuit that
I'm wearing it's like this neutral kind
of new dusty rose I don't even know what
color to call it it is from a ritzy ax
but the actual brand itself is Wilfred
free and the jacket that I got from this
place in the Toronto Eaton Center it's
like this Australian clothing store
called ever-new and I got it on sale in
the summertime probably going to guess
that I won't be able to find it but I'll
try and find something similar to it and
leave it down below and then as for the
jeans they are from Zara and the shoes
are from forever 21 and they matched the
color of the bodysuit which just kind of
like pulls everything together see you
guys it is February I made sure that the
jacket is a thin one so that you can
still put your winter jacket over if
you're going out and doing things but
this jacket itself is so like I don't
know I feel I feel so like badass but
since the Aquarius color is blue I
wanted to wear something blue to pull
that in dust concludes the look I also
wore this choker in the Capricorn video
and I'm gonna throw it on for this one
too it's just this little choker with a
moon on it I think it may have been
either from forever 21 or from spring
freakin sweating buckets right now so uh
and with that that concludes my Aquarius
get ready with me I hope you guys
enjoyed I had a lot of fun doing this
one and I wanted to make sure that it
was a lot different from the Capricorn
one and I already think I know what I'm
gonna do for the Pisces one so we're
just getting started guys leave a
comment down below let me know are you
