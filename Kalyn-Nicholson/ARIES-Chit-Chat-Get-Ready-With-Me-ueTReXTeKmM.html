silent Spindler cigarettes and makeup
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I am doing
another get ready with me and my zodiac
series and for today's video you're
doing the Aries funny enough I actually
didn't know much about the Aries before
I did some research so upon doing some
research I found out that Aries
timestamp is between March 20th and
April 19th their symbol is the RAM of
their color is red or element is fire
and couple famous people would be like
Leonardo da Vinci or Lady gaga the
strengths of Aries include being
courageous determined confident
enthusiastic optimistic honest
passionate those are all things that I
think about what I think of like a fire
sign so that that makes like a lot of
sense - as her weaknesses Aries are
known for being a little impatient a
little moody a little impulsive I feel
like I should have been in Aries and
some of the things they like our comfy
clothes which I took into account for
this get ready with me leadership all of
that good stuff like getting things done
what I'm grasping is that they are fiery
they're confident they're enthusiastic
they like to be leaders at the same time
they they they're like they like to do
it comfortably you know they like to do
it on their terms and so I kind of set
that into play using that the fire sign
is the fact that it's kind of spring
weather so I threw the jean jacket in
there a ram with creating some hair
horns that I was trying to get like the
curliness of the ramp and thus became
this look you guys haven't seen a
Capricorn what have we done now we've
done Capricorn Aquarius and Pisces
I will link those down below so
definitely go check that out and aside
from that if you guys want to get ready
with me for this Aries look then just
keep watching
that's per usual today's mug is the
copies always a good idea this is such a
classic I've had this one that since the
first apartment I've ever moved into and
I can't get rid of it because it speaks
much truth okay so Aries Aries Aries
they're not Aries that's throwing me off
a little bit is that their color is red
red isn't like necessary
the color of them feeling low strong too
lately because it's spring we're gonna
get creative I have to go to like it's
kind of like a business meeting so I
can't go too crazy on my face for this
one so I'm gonna prime my face with the
bare minerals good vibrations the silky
face primer and it's hydrating lately
especially now that like winters winding
down my skin has been getting a bit
better than it was but I still feel like
the air it's so dry I'm trying to use
basically all things that are hydrating
realistically it probably should just
continue to increase my water intake but
you did what you can do
so quiet
so we're browsing to use the products
that I've just been using and generally
it's the Tarte physique I'll browse
these have been like my favorite thing
ever because I feel like they're perfect
for spring they enhance your natural
brow and they add like definition and
color without making them too precise
and I don't know I've been digging the
kind of wild brow lately so like combing
out all the hairs you know earth like I
guess so I like these because they have
with a little spooley on the end which
makes it easy to like comb out your
brows but it also just like adds just
just enough color development wear eye
shadow I'm going in with the tartlet
toasted I'm not gonna do too crazy of
eyeshadow because I think I want to make
the lashes just like super bushy and
then do a bold lip but a little
something to my crease so I'm gonna go
up with latte just because it's pretty I
feel like it's pretty neutral it's warm
tone try that out see how that goes so
I've got a little too much but I'm
basically just gonna pop this in
and if you
I feel like that's what I'm gonna keep
the face at I kind of you know like a
neutral palette so that I can pop the
lips and do some crazy stuff my hair so
for the base of my lip so this is the
first time I'm trying this
it's the buxom power pump tinted lip
balm even if it's not dark enough I'll
go over it but I just wanted to kind of
plump up my lips a bit and this is in
the color fiery I've been super in two
lip balms lately if I som have a lot of
really really good ones
I haven't been drawn to wear as much
makeup I've just been kind of doing a
bit of foundation a little bit of brown
a little bit of mascara and then like a
lip balm and one cut down I'm getting
ready it's so much and - I just feel
like for spring it's so much more I
don't know but other than lazy but
partly also I like the kind of natural
feel to it you know so I've been super
into lip balms lately see how this color
I'm just gonna wear the lip off wine
it's super moisturizing and my lips are
already so dry and to I kind of like I
don't know I kind of like turned out so
that I mean that there you have it now
I'm just gonna curl my hair really
quickly I'm going to just be using the
normal curling iron that I always use I
think it's a one and a half or two inch
curling wand to call my hair back and
then I will share with you guys I like
to put a little horn as well well ram
horns my head save you guys some boredom
boom where my hair I did really really
big ringlets for the reason that Vidya
areas like Ram horn they like hook back
and curl so I'm gonna try it like I
don't know what I'm gonna try and do but
we're gonna try to do something about
that
like almost take this piece twist it
towards so twist it so the bottom comes
up like this and twist your hand
backwards
push it up start by taking it a little
elastic putting it on the twist
interesting my horoscope today it says
that there's no point being pessimistic
about life because harmful thought
patterns make negative outcomes more
likely shift the focus of your thinking
on to what matters and what makes you
feel good about yourself there are
plenty of them but you care to look
that's been the theme this week is like
positive thinking and Law of Attraction
that video and like this week that's why
is this one doing the same thing I'm
taking the bobby pins themselves and
putting them almost in to the bumps so
I'm putting them in the this direction
but trying to clip the little elastics
about a space into place and then
because you're going up and this is like
up here it's puff it kind of hides the
top of the bobby pin now I'm just gonna
re curl these really quick and then
hairspray the carpet of most place today
in big giant ringlets and then little
bit too
there's so much hairspray right so that
completes the makeup and the hair
portion of this get ready with me as for
you know the outfit I decided to make
this outfit like casual comfy but also
the type of outfit you could wear to
like get each done because Aries are
known for being eccentric and
enthusiastic and courageous and I also
rather they like to wear comfy clothes I
felt like this kind of outfit was one
that's perfect for spring it's perfect
for getting things done but getting
things done comfortably I also put on a
Rolling Stone shirt because the Rolling
Stones symbol in itself is so like like
rock on and it's red like the color of
Aries through a jean jacket over top
since it is spring and I feel like it
just kind of adds that like rock on vibe
and then as for the leggings that I'm
wearing they're from Lululemon because
health they're comfy pop awesome a look
if you're on some classic converse
because they're comfortable but they're
also cute and they're perfect for spring
and just it pulled I feel like they
pulled the whole outfit together and
thus became the Aries look so with that
I hope you guys enjoyed today's get
ready with me leave a comment down below
if you are in Aries and if you are be
easy on me i-i've never this is like my
first tip of my toe into the area's pool
