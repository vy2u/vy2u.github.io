you
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I am doing a Q&amp;amp;A all
about dream catcher just quickly before
I jump in this video is actually being
sponsored by TV so I was actually
selected to receive a teeny thin count
because I'm obviously super passionate
about mental health and the awareness
that surrounds it so what that actually
means is that the teeny think count gets
to go to any charity of my choice
so this actually ties in to my book a
bit too as you guys all know further on
in the video we'll talk about that but I
decided to donate the cheesy thing to
count two healthy Minds Canada which is
a non-profit non-government organization
so all of the money actually goes right
to the source and it will also raise the
awareness to what mental health is and
how to deal with it and it'll help
better equip people that are struggling
with mental illness to learn how to deal
with these types of emotions so this is
a cause that's obviously very near and
dear to my heart and I just thought it
was really really cool and I want to
give a huge shout out and thank you to
TD to reaching out to me and choosing me
and yeah I just it's just such a cool
cause and it's actually going to tie
into the book so now without further ado
let's jump into the dreamcatcher Q&amp;amp;A
some of those you guys I don't know
dreamcatcher is actually the book that
I'm writing and I posted this picture to
Instagram asking you guys to list all of
your questions about writing the book
what the books about
things like that so one of the biggest
questions that I've been asked is what
is the book about so if you guys are
curious what the storyline is I don't
want to give too much of it away to you
guys and I want it to be a bit of a
surprise long story short it is about a
girl who dreams of the same guy her
entire life ever since she was really
young and she falls in love with the boy
in her dreams so that's kind of like the
storyline of it there's so much more
that actually goes on but I don't want
to give too much of it away
it is dystopian and it is a little bit
off into the future that's the basic
storyline behind it I know that's really
really vague and it didn't really give
you much of a storyline at all but trust
me when I say you're going to want to
wait to read the book to really find out
what it's about because it is insane to
get
crazy trust me another huge question I'm
getting is what inspired me to write
this book
so the backstory to dreamcatcher is that
I actually initially wrote this book for
the very very first time it was ever
written was when I was in grade 12 I was
taking a course called writer's craft
where if you learn all about creative
writing and our culminating assignment
that year was to write a long like piece
and it could have been whatever we
wanted we had full creative control so I
decided to write a novel and so that was
the first time I actually wrote this
book so then what ended up happening is
a few months back now almost a year ago
I was living with my best friend Maggie
and we found chapters of it in my email
so I decided that I was going to rewrite
the entire thing and release it for you
guys to see then what ended up happening
is I got almost to the very very end of
writing it and I was hitting such a blog
I just got to hit me that while
rewriting the story I kind of fell out
of love with it not that it wasn't a
good storyline but it just it was
something that I came up with when I was
17 18 and I just felt a lot of it was a
little juvenile
I wanted to completely you know not
change the storyline because it's still
about the same thing the very very first
version was about a girl that dreams of
a boy her whole life and falls in love
with him so this story line is the same
but everything else is completely
different including the main character
that's kind of like the back story of
how I got inspired to write it
I always come up with like weird story
ideas all the time and I write them down
and this was just one that I ran with
and in grade 12 and then it kind of
evolved in the last few months and it's
way more of a stronger story now and
there's so much more to it and there's
so many more twists and turns that
happen this time around and yeah it's
just way way better another big question
I'm getting is when is the release date
so I don't have a specific release date
yet but I will announce when it's going
to be released on my Twitter once I have
an official date so be sure to watch out
for that you guys aren't following me
I'll leave my twitter somewhere on the
screen here so another big question I'm
getting is what is my favorite part of
writing or writing the book or what's
the best part of writing in the right
process and so I feel like for me and
this kind of ties back to the TD thank
you like the mental awareness and mental
health and such is that there's a big
part of this book that I got to pour a
lot of my own kind of emotional
struggles into in the sense that you
guys will understand when you read the
book but Carson the main character goes
through a period of anxiety and she's
going through a period of night terrors
and such and so was one of my favorite
parts about writing this book is that I
got to really take things that have
happened to me and my own struggles and
things that I've kind of went through
with my own anxiety actually got to put
it into a character and like kind of
develop a character through those things
and it's just really cool to be able to
take your own personal experience and
kind of turn it into a story and turn it
into something that like something that
people will be able to pick up and read
and kind of relate to so another really
popular question I'm getting is how do I
push through writer's block and like I
said before when I was writing this book
the first well second time around
Moore's most recently before I changed
the storyline I was getting so much
writer's block because I wasn't really
falling in love with the story anymore
or just as love with it with it as I
used to be so the way I had to push
through writer's block is if I was
sitting there and I'm trying to write
and I'm really struggling and nothing's
really flowing out or I'm not loving
like what I'm writing down I'll stop
I'll take a break I'll pop my headphones
in I'll go for a walk outside I'll go
for a drive and blare like the music
that I have that kind of coincides of
the book like I did a playlist last year
for it and there's just like my Chris
leaves and lattes playlist that's a lot
of that kind of music or no but more
like that either my headphones or my car
and just drive around and kind of get
re-inspire by it again I'll kind of try
and put my headspace into the book
rather than just writing the book does
that make sense I hope so but anyway I
try and just get super inspired by
listening to the music that reminds me
of the book and walking around or seeing
things or pulling up like really cool
like artsy photography and stuff that
kind of read re inspires like exactly
what I'm trying to get across
if you
questions I'm getting here are have you
based some of the characters off people
in your own life and yes I have actually
there's a few characters in the book
that are based off of people that I know
for instance Carson's best friend in the
book named Mina and you guys already
know that my best friend's name's Maggie
so so Mina is kind of based off of mags
although their personalities aren't that
similar but there are parts of Mina's
personality those like mags and their
friendship dynamic is very similar to
mine and Maggie's friendship dynamic so
yeah there's people like that and
another thing is too is that there are
certain dreams that Carson has that are
kind of themed after people in my life
or themed after like ex-boyfriends
possibly and so yeah like there's
different ways that I kind of
incorporated the way certain people have
made me feel certain memories I've had
with people and things like that and
found a way to kind of creatively put
them into the book so I'm getting asked
if I'm going to be turning it into a
series or if I plan on writing a second
book after this there are two books in
this series so it's not necessarily
series but I've already come up with the
plot for the second book the first book
does leave you on a tiny bit of a
cliffhanger okay maybe a really big
cliffhanger it's like a medium
cliffhangers if I'm going to be
releasing it as an e-book or getting it
published we're working on getting it
published so fingers crossed send it all
your good vibes that that is going to
happen that is the main goal for me
right now either way it will be an
e-book regardless of if it's published
or not so no matter what wherever you
are in the world and that's another
question too is if it's going to be
released in all these different
countries no matter what it will be an
e-book so you will be able to get your
hands on it and I'm going to try my
absolute hardest to get it physically
published so that you guys can actually
physically have the book and read it
yourselves become thing that's actually
been a huge dream of mine since I was a
child is to publish a book so it would
be a huge thing off of my dream board
okay so I this is a cool question
somebody asked for the first sentence in
the book maybe we'll give you guys the
first paragraph shall we the night sky
was
tickler shade of midnight blue the stars
twinkling and dancing like someone had
spoke glitter in the air I closed my
eyes and leaned back arm stretched up
high as the wind whipped twirled and
pulled up my hair like a hurricane the
Jeep tore down the empty street at a
speed that would definitely result in
the loss of a license in the real world
I screamed howling to the sky as I stood
with half my body lurched shadows of the
roofless Jeep I towered over I heard a
laugh from the driver's seat and look
down I adjusted to hold my balance as I
stretched my foot out to kick graze on
so yeah the book starts in a dream if
you're curious maybe so that was it for
the dreamcatcher Q&amp;amp;A be sure to check
out my Twitter so you guys know when the
release date is coming I want to start
releasing little bits to maybe kind of
like tease you guys into getting excited
for the book so and if there's any
questions that I may have missed or any
more things you guys are kind of curious
about about the book be sure to leave it
down below because I know I didn't
answer everybody's questions there were
so many on there so there's something
that you really wanted to know or a big
question that I may have missed let me
know down below and I will try and get
to as many of you guys as possible and
again another huge huge huge thank you
to TD and for choosing me to receive the
TD thing count thank you guys for
