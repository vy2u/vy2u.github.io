going to be sitting and talking with you
guys it's a video but this highly highly
requested so I figured it's about time I
just do it for you guys especially since
as yesterday I got some more of what
we're going to be talking about does
that make any sense yes it does so for
today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you guys my tattoos what they are
like what they symbolize for me and why
I got them um so basically the full
rundown I have four tattoos I will be
showing you every single one of them and
what they mean so um this is a very very
highly requested video a lot of you guys
asked me where my tattoos are or what
they say or why I got them or what I
mean or just to just do a tattoo video
in general so I'm fulfilling those
people's needs by sharing with you guys
my tattoos and just as a disclaimer for
this video as well I'm a very
open-minded person I think if people
want to get tattoos then go for it and
if you don't like tattoos then don't
like tattoos I feel like that's totally
okay we are each our own individuals and
it's okay to like something and somebody
else not like it so I just hope that if
any of you are watching this and you're
not a big fan of tattoos that you keep
your judgements to yourself is that as
you and this is me and this is who I am
and what I light and like if you guys
don't like such is just totally okay you
don't have to like tattoos but just keep
like your harsh comments to yourself
because people talk to is that's on them
for life so first things first I
actually got two new tattoos recently
and you would have seen the picture of
the one on my hand
just yesterday whoa I don't know when
you're watching this but I instagrammed
it anyways so a lot of you guys already
know about this one so I will show you
you guys this one first this one is on
the side of my hand it's nice and small
um and I instagrammed about it basically
what it is is I will change the focus so
you guys can see it better so there it
is it is my last name on the side of my
hand and basically what it means like
being a girl when I get married one day
hopefully I won't be carrying my last
name anymore my last name is very very
long so it'd be hard to hyphenate it and
I just feel when I get married I'll
probably just take one last name so I
won't for always carry this last name
which kind of deeply saddens me because
I just I love being a Nicholson and it
means
lots of me because it was a name
obviously passed down by both my dad my
papa
and the string goes on from there but
both my dad and my papa are huge people
in my life and they mean the world to me
and as you guys may have known I lost my
papa
a couple months ago he passed away and I
was looking to get a tattoo of my last
name and I wanted to do it in his
signature so I searched everywhere for
one of his signatures and I just
couldn't find the right one and I guess
it kind of worked out that I didn't get
it right away because what ended up
happening is when I moved into this
apartment when I was moving all my stuff
I found an envelope and the envelope was
from my very last birthday from my when
my papa was alive for so he was alive
for my 19th birthday and I'm now 20 so
he wasn't there for my 20th but he was
there for my 19th and it was the last
birthday card I got from him and my Nana
and on the envelope itself he actually
wrote my name because they had to mail
it to me so he wrote Kaelyn Nicholson
which means it was in his writing and it
was actually the Nicholson portion of my
birthday card which he had written out
my full name and I just it almost just
clicked perfectly so that is the exact
Nicholson signature that was on the
envelope I took it in and they scanned
it they put it on my hand and then I got
it tattooed so that is Nicholson in my
Papa's writing from my last birthday
card from him and it's just such an
important and symbolic tattoo to me so
this one is probably the most important
one to me out of all of mine and I
absolutely love it and I decided to get
it on the side of my hand because I
wanted it visible and I was going to do
it here but I wanted to be able to wear
bracelets and stuff since I have a
tattoo on this hand so I don't know it
just kind of worked out I was initially
going to put it on my opposite of my
ring finger this is my left hand ring
finger this would be the opposite but
finger tattoos fade really quickly so I
decided to do it on the side of my hand
and that is the full gist of this tattoo
my next tattoo I'll show you is the one
on my opposite hand and it's just on my
wrist this is the first tattoo I had
ever gotten I was 18 so I got it two
years ago and it just says fearless and
I decided to get it on my wrist because
I wanted it to be something I could see
every day to remind myself and basically
the reason why I decided on fearless is
because in life I especially tend to
sometimes hold myself back because I'm
afraid of
certain things like I'm afraid
something's going to happen and just
with my anxiety and such it just it's a
huge thing for me that I tend to draw
away from life sometimes so the reason I
decided to get fearless is because I
wanted to remind myself to live despite
the things that scare me to do things
anyways even though they will scare me
and to act as if I am fearless so that
is the meaning behind the fearless
tattoo on my wrist my next tattoo is
actually on my side or on my rib and I
will show it to you guys now so it's
just this arrow you'll see it right here
and I actually drew this arrow myself so
I drew the arrow myself I free handed
the arrow and actually this one has a
lot of different meanings to it so
you'll notice that it's on my rib umm
beside my heart and you'll act if you
look closely at the arrow the the point
on the end of the arrow I made it look
like a sideways heart because I wanted
it to kind of mean follow your heart or
follow your arrow just follow your path
you guys have heard me say that before
that we're all like leading our own
different paths in life and so for me it
means follow your path don't feel like
you have to do something because someone
else is doing it
just be yourself be you and be true to
who you are and just do your thing and
there's nothing wrong with that and
obviously I have it pointing out my
heart because it means to follow your
heart and always kind of listen to what
your heart is trying to tell you now
there are other meanings to it too
because if you look at the back of the
arrow there are three little arrows like
this and for each tick them trying to
make this sound the least confusing as
possible so that means there's three
ticks on the top of the arrow and three
ticks on the bottom and that wrap the
lip and that resembles six people that
mean the most to me and that is my Nana
my papa my mom my dad and my sister and
my brother so that is why there are six
ticks and the six ticks come together to
make three arrows three is my favorite
number and for me it just means part of
like following your arrow and following
in life is to remember your past your
present and your future and to keep in
tune with your mind your body and your
soul or spirit so that is kind of a
really long explanation to the one
simple arrow but it just it kind of all
came together and meant one thing to me
I like the fact that I kind of drew it
myself what I did drop myself so that is
why I
the arrow last but not least is the
tattoo I have on my thigh it's probably
the one I get the most questions about
I'll put a clip in right here to show
you guys because I'm wearing leggings
right now so I wouldn't be able to show
you right now the one of my thighs says
she flies with her own wings I got it
about a year and a half ago and to me it
just symbolizes a big part of just Who I
am I am a very independent person and I
mean at times it almost kind of gets in
my way because I am so independent that
I find it hard to let other people help
me it just means like I it's so hard to
explain it's it's just really really
symbolic quote to me because it
symbolizes independence and working hard
for yourself and believing in yourself
and just staying true to who you are and
that is basically what it means for me
is that I'm just such an independent
person and of course you need people in
life but when it boils down to it like I
really can just be on my own if I need
to be and at the time in my life that I
got it it was really really perfect
timing too and I think it's going to be
a quote that sticks with me for life it
kind of reminds me not to question
myself and just to know that to believe
in myself and to trust myself so that is
what that tattoo means for me and I
decided to get it on my leg just because
it was a long quote and being on my leg
it's an easy place to cover it up and
hide it most of my tattoos actually
except for the hand one are very easy to
hide so not that I care to hide them
it's just if I needed to I can and I
just liked the placement on my leg and
especially for the summertime wearing
shorts and stuff you can see it so I
really enjoyed putting it there so
that's where that went
and yeah so guys those are my four
tattoos a lot of you guys have been
requesting this video to know where my
tattoos are what they are and what they
mean to me so that is them I think I'm
pretty okay for tattoos for a while I
don't think I have any in mind for
anytime soon it'll probably be over at
least a year or two before I get any
more if I get any more I'm not sure I
kind of want to save any more small
tattoos for things that may be symbolic
towards me into the future so I am just
going to leave it at that those are my
four tattoos let me know down below if
you guys have any tattoos and what they
I would love to hear about them and for
you to tell me what they mean to you if
you feel like it and I will see you guys
all in a future video thanks for
