today's video I'm going to be filming my
apartment decor haul just as promised I
have so much cute apartment stuff to
show you guys and you're probably
thinking where the hell are you filming
well I'm filming my apartment decor hall
in my new apartment it's not even near
close to being done decorated or
anything like that and I'm not even
fully moving in until the end of this
month but I am going to be bringing a
lot of my stuff in throughout the month
and I'm also have already brought my
office stuff as you can see behind me
and all of my filming gear oh I can
start filming videos here now so yeah
that's welcome to my apartment once it
is all decorated I have a 100% can do an
apartment tour but until then let's jump
into the apartment decor ball guys I
have bought so much stuff for this
apartment I am so excited to decorate so
I guess I should start by letting you
guys know like the theme I was kind of
going for step 2 a lot of whites and
grays and a little bit of blacks and
then the like pop of color in my living
room is like a peachy Coral
and I hadn't really fully decided what
I'm doing for colors in terms of all the
other rooms especially the kitchen but
that is kind of like the theme I was
going for and in terms of like the style
or inspiration I would say it's
definitely inspired by like New York
City but maybe like old-school New York
City because I've got my vintage cameras
and I've got a big popcorn machine and
all of that stuff and I also have like
my bathroom has a bit more of like a
wonder less theme so I mean all in all
it's basically like modern meets chic
meets like travel if that makes any time
so without further ado let's move into
the hall I am so excited so you guys
probably won't be surprised to know that
I have a lot to show you guys from
society6 so let's start with them one of
the first things I picked up
is this pillow here is this not just the
coolest thing you've ever seen in your
life basically it's just like a black
and white pillow up I like close-up of
the lens of a camera which just screams
me and not only just screams me but a
totally fit the theme I was going for so
this is the first pillow I got I got it
in small in Addis from society6 and all
the links to things I'm showing you guys
I will leave down below but there are
three pillows that I also kind of kept
with the theme and I wanted them to be
the bigger pillows on the couch and not
as like the Marvel theme so I decided to
get these like marble design pillows
this is size large from society6 so if
you are shopping on there and you want
to know the difference between like a
small pillow and a large pillow this is
the difference here it's about two of
these ones that are just like straight
marble and then the third pillow I
bought it's marble with the peachy coral
just on the bottom so the marble ones go
on each corner because I have an L couch
and then this one goes in the little
middle like sectional you guys will see
it the cutaway but basically this is the
other marble pillow that I got and I'm
obsessed with this it's also my phone
case if you guys didn't know that
because you guys keep asking me where my
phone case is from it's all from
society6 so this is the other color that
I picked up next pillow guys I got a lot
of pillows okay I got a new couch and
it's a big couch so I needed a lot of
pillows the next one I got is this one
here and it's probably my favorite one
that I picked up it says I just want to
drink coffee create stuff and sleep aka
my entire life and then last but not
least in terms of pillows this is the
final pillow I have to show you guys
another small one and this one kind of
has like a mixture of the marble and
like the peachy pink so I was kind of
going for and yeah so that is the last
pillow I have to show you guys again
it's from society6 and I lead a link to
it down below but as you can see like
the whole theme is kind of like a marble
black white and grey PG theme so another
thing I picked up in society6 is this
blanket here which Bentley is sleeping
in I'm sorry my love you poor thing
anytime I buy a new blanket that way
just takes it over for 10 sedatives I'm
really bad okay so I'm just going to
show you guys this one get really quick
so that badly can go back to sleep in it
I picked up this blanket here from
society6 as well I will get up and show
you guys the whole thing on camera I was
actually really really happy with the
quality of this blanket I wasn't really
sure what it was gonna feel like or look
like when it came and he is trying to
dig his went into the blanket again but
the quality of this is really good it's
nice and thick and then on the other
side it's got like this soft faux I
don't even know what this is it just
feels like clouds that's the only way I
can describe it this is the blanket that
I got I'll show you guys what it says
today has been cancelled I get back down
now celeb Bentley doesn't get mad there
you go them so yeah so this is the
blanket that I got it's so comfy and
cozy and I'm absolutely obsessed with it
if you guys can't tell them in a really
good mood right now because I'm just in
love with everything that I'm getting
for my apartment and I'm just so excited
for it to finally all come together what
up what up what up what up what would in
order from society6 be without a
tapestry I did get a brand new tapestry
I know you guys are probably thinking
can you lately have change but I needed
one that was gonna fit my living room
theme so I got one that's gonna go above
my couch and I'll do a cutaway clip here
too to show you guys what it looks like
but basically it is this tapestry here I
got it
I think this is a medium size it's a
city in skyscraper city lids its city
landscape city skyscrapers that's great
what it's a picture of New York City
let's just go with that so this is what
it looks like it's like a big city
tapestry and I'll just do a cutaway clip
right now showing you guys what it looks
like so let you guys get a better idea
than you just trying to hold it up on my
couch but yes that is the tapestry that
I got I'm obsessed
I'm in love and I'm just I'm addicted
I'm so in love with everything guys oh I
just can't wait but I have two more
things to show you guys from society6
one of them is this clock here I picked
this up and it's kind of got again like
the city in the background like
skyscraper landscape I don't really know
what we're going to call it today
because apparently I can't remember what
it is but yeah it's just this clock and
I'm doing the gallery wall again above
TV's so this is going to be going on the
gallery wall and I it fit the New York
theme so this is the rug that I grabbed
for just going for like where you first
walk in and just to put down your shoes
I don't really know but anyway it's so
cute I'm obsessed with it I'm pretty
much obsessed with everything in this
video if you're probably gonna hear me
say that word a lot and I apologize
alright so next I'm gonna move into Home
sense so if you guys don't have a home
sense all my Canadians will know what
I'm talking about but I believe home
sense is very similar to home goods I
could be totally wrong about that but
Marissa lace always sends me so many
pictures of all the stuff she gets from
home goods and I'm always like hard eye
emoji I wish I could go to home goods
and then I kind of realized that she was
sending me selves like that store kind
of looks or reminds me of home sense
one of the first things I picked up heat
from home sense was this year it's kind
of just like I don't even know what you
would call this anyways it's just this
little like container thing basically
what I plan on doing with this plan on
putting all of bed least toys in this
and then just putting this on the ground
I thought it was a lot cuter than the
shoebox I have and yes Bentley has
enough toys that he actually has a toy
box and he loves his toy box like he
goes over and you'll see him like dig
his head in and the other day I actually
watched him put one of his toys back in
his toy box to grab another one and it
was the cutest thing I've ever seen
so the next thing I picked up from
HomeSense is this little Buddha and I'm
obsessed with him so this is going to go
in my bathroom it's just this cute
little leak again it kind of fits the
Marvel theme but it's like this like
greyish white Little Buddha guy and I'm
just I don't know I love him he totally
fits the theme of my bathroom that I'm
kind of going for so this is a little
Buddha that I got from HomeSense and
this was 1999 so if you guys follow me
on snapchat you would have already seen
this but long story short I do pretty
little iron Tuesdays with my dad we get
together on Tuesdays we eat pitas and we
watch Pretty Little Liars and one time
like a year ago there was an episode
where Ali was drinking out of a yellow
mug after the clip was over I was like I
didn't even hear a word she said I was
staring at that yellow bug and my dad
started laughing because he was like I
knew you were thinking that
you were looking at the yellow mug the
whole time so I've been on the hunt for
a year to find a mellow mug I don't
really know if you guys care about that
story but I wanted to tell you anyways
because that is the story behind this
mug and I was so excited I was so happy
to the point that I actually like texted
my dad freaking out though it might just
be a yellow mug to you in this video and
you're probably thinking like hurry up
skip ahead I want to see what else you
got this was a very this was a
life-changing moment for me and then
next the kind of color scheme in my
bathroom is a bit different than the one
out here again it's like grays and
blacks and all of that but it's also got
more of like the tiffany robin egg blue
so this is the little container that I
got for just like be like bathroom stuff
to go in my bathroom I love the design
on it this is like one of my favorite
designs it's also the design on my
curtains so yeah so and this was $12.99
from home scents and then the other
thing I picked up from home scents are
just so cute I think these are the
cutest things ever I've got these little
salt and pepper shakers and they're mini
mason jars so this is only $5.99 from
home cents I'm so dorky about this stuff
I just I love it I love it and the next
room HomeSense I picked up this candle
I've been kind of I don't know if it's
just me or what it is but I've been kind
of veering away from back and Bodyworks
candles recently for some reason I just
I like a candle that's got a little bit
more character god I sound like such a
basic girl right now anyway I picked up
this candle it's like a matte black and
it's called tobacco and Oakley light
like manly oaky type smells those are
like my go-to my favorites so this is
the candle I picked up it's called
tobacco and oak and it's just like a
matte black and I love the top of it it
looks like like a slack of wood it looks
so cute so that is a little lid to it
and it smells this smells like a really
really Hawkeye smoking a cigar but
that's the only way I can think of oh
yes that's exactly it smells like Jax
teller smoking a cigar so next I wanted
to pick up a cute little leaf for my
door because I've known
some of the people that live in this
apartment building that I'm living in
how to reads on the door and I just
think that's so cute and I totally
wanted to be a part of it especially now
that we're moving into spring so while I
was at home since I picked up this
wreath is this not like the cutest thing
you have ever seen I love the color of
this and I'm so I'm such an old lady
guys I can't wait to go hang this on my
door one of the next things I have to
show you guys that I got from HomeSense
is this here I pick this up it's going
to go in my living room because as you
can tell the flowers kind of match the
peachy coral theme I was going for but
it's just this cute little like mini
wooden box of fake flowers and then the
last thing I have to show you guys from
HomeSense is another candle because
surprise surprise so this is the last
panel that I picked up and it is it was
$9.99 and it's ginger flower and
patchouli and again it's like the peachy
color to match my living room so I
always say this is going in my living
room it's a very clean smell so that is
a cute little peach colored candle that
I picked up from hope sense so then I
asked for IKEA I would love to be able
to just like hold up all the things that
I got from Ikea and show you guys but to
be honest everything is like kind of
massive so first things first I did pick
up this couch that I'm sitting on in the
last few years I haven't had the nicest
couches like my couches would either had
like burns on them or stains on them or
Maggie and I pay for this like $50 cheap
couch that could fit through our door
because our old apartment it didn't like
you can't fit much through the doors
because it's such an old house it
literally makes your ass numb when
they're sitting on it it's so not comfy
so when I was moving into this apartment
I was like no I'm promising myself like
I'm going to invest in a nice couch I
want a nice couch so the couch I got
from Ikea it's the AL couch I'll do a
cutaway clip here and I got it in like
the light gray I was initially going to
get the medium gray one
but a light gray one for whatever reason
was like $200 $300 cheaper so yeah that
is the coach that I picked up from Ikea
I also picked up a coffee table it's
just like a plain square white one this
is what it looks like it is just like a
gloss finish and I I don't know I
pictured it being a lot taller but I
actually
really like the height of it because it
gives it that cool modern theme I also
picked up a rug and it's the rub that's
underneath the coffee table in the coach
and it's just like a dark gray shag rug
and again not much to say about it other
than the fact that I love the way it
turned out and I love the way it looks
with everything in the living room and
then I also last but not least picked up
these things here they're just like I
don't even I think this one's like a
candle one and this one's for flowers so
I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to
put in these yet I'm going to do flowers
or candles but I just thought they were
cute they were there two little white
like they look like little doilies
almost or like crochet detailing and
they're going to go together I'm
probably on my fireplace where my TV is
so yeah so those are the two little
containers that I got from Ikea I just
don't feel really cute there were like
three dollars and five dollars or
something like that
is that it no I want to show you guys
more so it seems as though that is all I
have to show you guys today i wish i had
more decor to show you I'll probably be
picking up a lot more things here at the
month so if you guys want to see another
apartment to Korhal let me know down
below if you guys like this video
because I will definitely refilm another
one there's still a bunch of stuff I
have to get for like my kitchen the
bedrooms and stuff like that so if you
guys want to see another video like this
then just either thumbs us up or let me
know in the comments down below so I can
tell that you guys are liking this video
and I will definitely refilm another one
bunny time MMO which item from this hall
was your absolute favorite I don't even
know if I had to choose it would
probably be my yellow bug but like if
we're going to take the yellow mug out
of the equation possibly my pillows no
probably my tapestry it would definitely
do my tapestry and also let me know down
below
you guys got to design your entire
apartment by yourself or let's say you
are designing an entire apartment by
yourself what kind of theme would you go
for and other than that I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing all the stuff that I
bought from my apartment and I will see
all of you guys in another video love
you
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
