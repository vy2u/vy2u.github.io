and
- I'm just so obsessed with the song
right now I probably used it for this
intro I'm obsessed what can I say it
makes me want to party without pants you
know hey guys so for today's video I am
so excited to bring you guys my
apartment tour I asked you guys recently
on Instagram whether you would want to
see an apartment tour first or some DIY
decor an apartment tour one by a
freaking landslide honestly let's have
no idea what what I had to go through
the last 48 hours to make my apartment
ready to be toured I can't even explain
when you guys see the tour and you see
what is the room I'm sitting in right
now which is my like Beauty room slash
filming room um it was filled from the
bookshelf all the way up until the door
with stuff and I'm talking like bags and
boxes and suitcases it was full my car
was also full if you guys watch How I
Met Your Mother
I pulled the Barney and was like
challenge accepted I've literally been
in a hibernation I've barely left my
hands aside from going to gym because I
wanted to do this tour video for you
guys so badly so I'm so excited I got it
done in time and I'm so excited to show
you guys my humble abode and I've been
feeling really good since I've moved
here I've been really cracking down on
like eating a lot more like high carb
like whole food vegan I've been working
out almost every single day solely just
to get out of my house because I do live
alone now I just have a really good gut
feeling you know like women's intuition
about it also you guys didn't know we
hit 100k on Instagram which is so sick
honestly guys I freaked out if you
aren't following me already I will leave
links down below and as well as if
you're on a computer on the screen to my
Instagram and my Twitter come follow me
let's stalk each other than that you
know my apartment isn't gonna feel like
home until I share it with you guys so
if you guys want to see a tour of my
apartment then just keep watching
okay so right when you walk in I just
have this mat here it's from society6 if
you guys watched my apartment decor haul
you guys will have seen that then up
here I just have this little like hook
thing from Walmart to be honest if
you're wondering what the pictures are I
just left whatever pictures they put in
there from Walmart and then on the hooks
I just keep like my hats that I wear
more often my satchel because my other
satchel broke my leather jacket and
Bentley's leash and then up here I
like my keys and my to like most worn
pair of sunglasses so when you first
walk into apartment to my apartment
sorry this is basically everything you
see I'll go through everything but just
to give you guys an overall view so
starting here this is just like a closet
which I probably should have Windex the
mirror prior to showing you
I literally just came from the gym so
I'm not wearing like any makeup so
there's like this area
honestly inside I just have extra shoes
that didn't fit in my closet room that's
that's literally it
rape aside there I decided to put my
little office area in this little like
nook right beside the closet I was
initially going to put it in my beauty
room which you guys will see but because
I don't know I just wanted my computer
out here because I do so much editing on
the computer and I'm always just like
sitting and chilling on the computer I
kind of wanted it to be out in like the
common area so I didn't feel so secluded
to the to that like little room at the
desk and chair both from Ikea and then I
have a blanket on here because I'm
literally freezing cold like 99% of the
time so and then over here I have this
Yankee Candle from when I lived at my
dad's house but it's sugar-flower bells
this is like from the top like this is
like a lid that was on a candle I use it
as like a coaster for my coffee now when
I'm editing and then this is just like a
little light-up Eiffel Tower that I got
from home sense and then obviously just
like my desktop and everyone always asks
me about this I believe I got this off
Amazon a couple years ago and then here
I just have like my phone just chilling
here for right now
my iPad my like little like journal for
writing like notes and video ideas and
stuff like that and then my agenda and
then I have this like this is like a
serving dish that I got from HomeSense
and then I have this is also from
HomeSense and I just keep all of like my
pens pencils highlighters and all that
fun stuff in there and I don't really
have anything over my like office area
yet but I'm planning on doing something
I'm just not sure what yet so and
Bentley is asking to go outside a little
rascal you want go inside so yeah so I'm
just behind my office area I have my
full-length mirror and then right beside
that I have this Voss or vase
it's from Target but we no longer have
target in Canada but I got it a few
years ago at Target and then this big
like peach flower is from HomeSense and
then I don't know where these two little
rose ones are they're probably from like
Walmart or something and then next to
that is the fireplace so this fireplace
I have no idea where it's from my
landlords actually kind of like gave it
to me there's like Oh like it kind of
comes with the unit so it was totally
perfect
so yeah that's like the little fireplace
unit if you're wondering what's on it on
the first shelf I just have like my
three vintage cameras and then I have my
xbox and Halo because it's the only game
I have right now and it's the only game
I play right now but I really need to
pick up Call of Duty and Grand Theft
Auto those were like my three favorite
games I you guys probably would have
never pegged me of someone that played
video games but I actually am obsessed
so the candle I have here is coconut
sandalwood by Bath and Body Works it
smells amazing I have my TV which is
currently just on like the country past
and then on this side of the fireplace I
just have these two little candle
holders those are from Walmart I believe
and I have like my little digital box
and then these two little like
candlestick holder things from Ikea and
then above my television area I just
have this like little gallery wall so
then next to there I just have this
little white chair I have no idea where
it's I have like a little planter pot
that's not what I'm planning on keeping
there I actually want to get like a nice
little lamp that like hangs the curtains
again are from yes or Jeschke or however
you want to call it and they're just
like the grey ones from my old bedroom
outside I have like a little patio area
which is super nice because now that
it's starting to get nice out I can have
like coffees out on my little like
barstools and stuff anyway next to the
door there is air conditioning and
Bentley's little igloo bed and then next
to that is his little toy box and then
this nightstand is from Ikea and the
lamp is from Target next to there I just
have my couch I decided to like splurge
when I was moving and actually get like
a nice couch all of the pillows on it
are from society6 everybody asks me
where this little faux fur throw is from
it's from home cents the blanket again
you would have seen it in my apartment
decor haul it is from
86 and then above it I just have a New
York City tapestry which is also from
society6 um just down below I had got
this massive like gray rug which I put
just in this area because it is hardwood
floors so which I didn't mop I apologize
and then this coffee table is also from
Ikea but it is amazing because it has
drawers so um like I keep like my
controllers and like my Xbox remote and
all of that stuff in there and then just
on top I have this little like peach
flower thing from home scents and two
candles from home scents so for my
little dining room area it's quite small
I have just like my bar table or
whatever which I got from JISC and my
little barstools on above it I just have
this like Brooklyn Bridge photo and then
I took wire lighting and I wired it
around the photo twice so like it's
really cool at night it's like lights up
the whole living room area and then I'll
turn off all the lights and it's just
super cozy candle is bow ties and
bourbon by Bath and Body Works and then
I just keep my laptop over here I have
Looking for Alaska because I'm reading
it in a magazine that just came in the
mail and then I keep my laptop here and
then I normally keep my beats over here
too because this is where I've been like
writing and stuff when it comes to like
dreamcatcher I'll usually put like my
beats on like my headphones so that I
don't get sidetracked ador check my
phone or like lolly deck or like walk
around and stuff and then over here on
the ground there's like this little
island thing which is totally random but
in case you guys were wondering that's
where Bentley's food is oh and also I
can't believe I completely forgot this I
also have this like popcorn machine from
my dad he got it for me for my birthday
and I'm like obsessed with popcorn if
you guys ever wondered what like my
favorite snack is so that is just right
there like on a little table and I think
it's cute because it kind of matches
like the New York theme so this is the
kitchen area it's like a tiny little
kitchen but I mean it's just me living
here so it's perfect I'm like I'm also
obsessed with the flooring which is like
a random detail but it's like real tile
which I thought was really cool so
kitchens going to be pretty standard you
know microwave oven I got these little
salt and pepper shakers from home cents
and I think they're so cute they're like
little mason jars and then Maggie got me
this for Christmas and it's just like
this cute little elephant kettle right
beside there I keep my blender for
smoothies in the morning and then like
my massive collection of bananas I just
restocked on a bunch today
why these ones are kind of green and
these ones are spotty and like
definitely need to be used like ASAP I
have my little cactus in my little
elephant mug if you guys remember when I
bought this elephant mug then comment
down below because that means you've
been watching for prettied a long time
and then right here I just have like
this little drawing mat with my mug on
it from this morning and then I actually
got this little drying rack thing from
Ikea cuz I thought it would just take a
lot of you know stuff off the counter
and I kind of liked the idea of it do
you know I don't know I just find out
like clears off a lot of counter space
and then over here I have my little
coffee
Keurig and my wine glasses and I'm also
D falling like coffee creamer right now
they this came with the apartment and I
thought it was cool because I hung up
all my wine glasses and then up here
this is like my coffee and tea haven if
you guys want to know what's in my
cupboards all of like my coffee my decaf
all of my teas and then all of my little
mugs and I actually got rid of so many
mugs and I moved guys you would be so
proud of me
I have minimized my clutter it's
ridiculous so up here we have cereal
oatmeal crackers little piece naps a
bunch of basmati rice and pasta
rye bread potatoes potatoes for you to
make this vegan popcorn and peanut
butter and beans just like a whole stock
of frozen veg frozen berries and frozen
strawberries for smoothies and then
vegan chicken and then like coconut ice
cream for you know just like days we
like splurging vegan butter a bunch of
condiments my waters my running water
and then like my daily water and then
basically a whole bunch of veggies and
like tofu and like I bought like a
massive stalk of lemons for like lemon
water it's also cuacamole hummus um
salads almond milk and yeah that's
that's really it and then like the rest
of my covers are literally just like
dishware and stuff so nothing really
cool to show you there and then lastly
on the wall that's just behind my fridge
I have these three clocks I'm planning
on putting different time zones of diff
three different places in the world I
just literally haven't gotten around to
doing it yet because I am a lazy moving
into the hallway there is this little
linen closet here I basically just key
this is where my towels usually go but
all of my laundry I'm doing all my
laundry right now at my mother's house
my massive candle collection which is
just ridiculous
and then like a bunch of like boxes and
stuff I have to bring back to kojic oh
so in the first bedroom I decided to
make it kind of like a filming room
slash closet I'll give you guys like an
overview and then we'll move in to like
actual details of everything so when you
walk in and you turn these mirrors just
came like already on the wall when I
moved into this apartment which was so
perfect because I love them they're just
I don't know other cool mirrors I don't
know I care so much but and then there's
this little closet here which inside I
have my extensions from the fall time
shirts sweaters coats hats extra
clothing that I'm planning on giving
away all my slippers are up here
sunglasses are in those box that box
anyway all my skirts are right there all
my tapestries and then that's like
bathing suits crop tops and shorts and
then behind there I just have my two
suitcases little like closet sectional
thing is from Ikea so on top I just have
all of like my purses again I did a huge
when I moved into here I did like a huge
spring cleaning and got rid of a lot of
stuff I donated a lot so this side is
like dresses that are kind of fall under
like a black red kind of category if
that makes any sense and then in the
middle are like a few of my maxi's and
cardigans and then this side this is
like my favorite side it's like the
bluey Purple's like um all of that kind
of stuff like more summery colors
florals and all that so that's why the
shoes below that one kind of match that
theme like tan colored shoes and like
all that fun like summery stuff and then
down below on that side it's like you
know blacks and booties and all that
stuff runners and then down below these
two little tub things are from well four
little tub things are from Walmart and
those are my two sets of running shoes
and then another set of like just like
white running shoes and a pair of flat
though that is basically the drift of
this whole little closet area and then
just behind it I have this little area
okay so my little yoga mat is down there
and then I have a bunch of extra bags
and stuff but also it doubles as like a
place to hide if anyone were to break
into my apartment okay and then this rug
if you guys remember it from like my old
old room tour hello there Bentley it is
from society6 and then I have this
little white bookshelf but I just put
all of my my other shoes like heels and
booties and more summery type shoes and
all of that fun stuff or just on this
little bookshelf and then on top I have
my extra camera lens my little pink
doggy and then two little baskets in
here as hair stuff in here is like
camera equipment and extra cords and
chargers and all of that fun stuff so
then next to there I got this little
desk from Ikea it was like decently
cheap it was like sixty bucks I think
but anyways this little desk fit
perfectly into this area and right
beside like the little IKEA drawers so
this is my little vanity now I will pull
the Muir's out and to do my makeup my
crystal from like my last few room tours
is there and it changes color in here is
like my more everyday stuff in terms of
makeup and I just keep all of that in
here and like hand sanitizer to like
sanitize before doing my makeup I can
give you guys like a 4 full Beauty room
tour but this stuff is just like a whole
bunch of randomness like lips
foundations and just like all of that is
all in there and then I have a couple
drawers that are like crafts and stuff
like that and then here is just my
little filming lamp
I have two other filming lamps but they
are in storage like in my little storage
room and then this picture here and it's
from yes ok so walking back out the next
bedroom is my bedroom which Bentley's
totally gonna hop up on the bed and ruin
it now so I'll give you guys again just
like a full overview before I kind of
give you guys all the details this
bedrooms I would say probably like the
least cluttered bedroom I've ever had so
you guys obviously know my bed
underneath that's like my fitness drawer
and then in there is like my pajamas
bras underwear all of that fun stuff so
I'm not going to show you that drawer my
bedding is from Target like the duvet
pillows from society6 the pink pillow is
obviously from Victoria Secret pink
those two little things are from home
scents and I have this like canvas over
top of it I have no idea what I want to
do for above my bed yet that is why it
is blank let's just pretend it's a
metaphor so then right here we have like
a little closet mirrors I just
how many mirrors are in this apartment
it's ridiculous and they're all like
good good mirrors you know what I mean
none of them are like like chunky
mirrors so and then in here again I'm
doing all of my laundry now so it's
super bare but all of my sweaters like
casual daily sweaters and then this is
usually where my hamper goes but again
for the billionth time I'm in the middle
of doing laundry and then right next to
there I just have my guitar I have my
dreamcatcher hanging in the window and
then next to that it's my little
fireplace which you guys have seen
before but as always I'm sure someone's
going to ask so it is from Rona and then
I have my little small flat screen in
here and another cogeco box because like
I like to fall asleep with music or TV
yawns I have this little like cubicle
thing I think I got it from Walmart I
have my records and then just a bunch of
different books and it is out of focus
and this little horse guys from Walmart
and then I have my record player on top
and I was listening last night to 1989
and it's super dusty and I know that's
bad so before everybody freaks out on me
I'm sorry
um and then my bed as you guys know and
then just my nightstand and there's
really not much in my nightstand aside
for my remotes and I have this little
kiss me goodnight thing that I got from
the market in the summer last year of
our town the lamp is from Target little
reindeer guy is from Walmart is again
like probably like the least full or
cluttered bedroom I've had in the
longest time because this is my first
time living alone so all of my stuff is
like not confined to one tiny bedroom
okay and then last but not least we have
the bathroom which is right here let me
flick on the light so it's a pretty
standard bathroom guys I'm not going to
go into too much detail this thing came
with it this little shower curtain is
from society6 and it is of Lake Louise
in Alberta and then here we just have my
just like a hand towel and then this
thing here I think this is so cool
literally if you have been watching me
for long enough to know when my videos
were when I was in college I think some
of them are gone now but my dad actually
bought me this when I moved away to
college above there that is from
HomeSense and it's just literally got a
bun
of extra like products and stuff in it
I'm like obsessed with the sink I think
it's like a really really nice sink and
that is just that's a really random
detail to give you guys but yeah soap
and hand sanitizer and my little Buddha
if you guys can see this little mirror
this is like the most epic thing in the
world because when you're doing your
hair if you open this halfway so I can
like do my hair and see the back as I'm
like styling and all that stuff which is
probably my favorite part of this entire
apartment and that's pretty much it then
you can like walk back out to the main
area and yeah and I'll give you guys
like one last little no spin so you guys
can see the whole thing one more time
because I'm sure you guys haven't just
seen it like a billion times already so
that is it for my apartment tour I hope
you guys enjoyed getting to look at the
new space that I'm going to be living in
let me know down below which was your
favorite part about my apartment if not
I love you guys and I'll see you guys on
the future video bye guys
my good with just you t-shirt volume to
my favorite song</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
