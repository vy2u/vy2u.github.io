doing an apartment tour with you guys
which I'm really excited about I know
you guys been waiting for a very long
time since I've moved into this
apartment for me to do this video for
you guys and unfortunately kind of I'm
doing it during the Christmas season so
you guys don't really get the full
experience of my apartment you guys get
the Christmas experience of my apartment
so keep in mind this is my first
apartment I didn't need anything that
was super super big so it's nothing too
elegant or extravagant
but it is where I'm living and it is
something that you guys have been
requesting and seemed interested in so I
decided to go ahead and film it for you
guys and I'm going to show you guys my
apartment
starting now alright so this is what you
see when you first walk into our
apartment I'll pan across the whole
thing so you can see what it looks like
so I will start this way because Bentley
is looking super cute so walking in this
is like the living room area it's very
open concept so it's going to seem like
I'm kind of just in one big room because
I pretty much am I'm just going to walk
in and spin around so first there has
there is this chair here right now
obviously I'm in the very festive
Christmasy mood so there's a lot of
Christmas stuff out so I have just this
blanket that's draped over the side of
the couch I have this like sweater
pillow a white blanket over top you're
going to be noticed that I'm obsessed
with blankets I have a vase back there
that I have to change the flowers in I'm
changing them to poinsettias for
Christmas and then there's just the
entertainment system there is the TV the
Xbox candles the digital box for cable
that's it and then a basket full of
stuff so of course our Christmas tree is
up it's white and I decorated it with
red and gold so that is what the
Christmas tree looks like and then
beside the Christmas tree is the
fireplace which I recently purchased
this as well it's just an electric
fireplace but it gets super cold in here
so it keeps it nice
and warm and then just on top of the
fireplace I just have candles and
Nutcracker candles candles Eiffel Tower
and more candles and then of course the
stockings I am hanging them from the
candles themselves so on the windows I
layered white and gray curtains and then
down below there is Bentley's dog bed
pillows that I have up during the non
Christmas season and our night table
with the lamp and candles so then I have
the big couch here and right now I just
have pillows that are white gold and red
and that blanket usually isn't there
that's my new Victoria Secret blanket
but Bentley kind of took it over from me
so I bet you if we go look there he'll
be under it there you are
do you want to go back to sleep so on
the floor there's this gray shag rug
that I got from Target I believe it was
in the teen section and then we have the
white coffee table which is from Ikea
and I think I paid like 25 bucks for it
and on top of the coffee table is a
holiday candle from Bath and Body Works
and it's called espresso and those of
you that know I'm obsessed with coffee
it's like the perfect candle for me so
then next to the couch I just have this
poof ball from Target that's gray and
white and you like can pull it out and
sit on it
or rest your feet on it or if guests are
over they can sit on it and yeah so
that's pretty use for that so then here
I just have one of those like big giant
full-length mirrors next to my guitar
that is the mirror and it's silver and
it's from JISC and there's my outfit not
sure exactly what kind of guitar it is
my dad got it for me then of course next
to that is my little office area or sad
excuse for one I have like boxes and
bags outlook forever21 box and stuff
because I'm planning on doing another
haul and then I have like the two purses
that I've been using the most recently
and then in there is just like receipts
and papers and important stuff I need to
keep so then I just have my computer and
my computer chair and my thing full of
makeup and the makeup on the top and if
you guys want to full like makeup tour I
can give you guys
one um it's basically just full of like
my makeup and stuff so if you guys want
to see like how I organize my stuff and
stuff
ask for the video and I shall do it
sorry guys can't hear me but I just I
have to have Taylor Swift playin while I
film this so there's the makeup that I
wear every day and the mirror that I use
for makeup there's my agenda my phone my
coffee from like five minutes ago and
then of course my computer my iTunes is
up and then my keyboard and mouse and
phone charger so yeah not that exciting
but that is my little work area and then
my stuff that's ready for a haul and
then if you come back over to this side
that is just a closet but I can show you
so yeah there's like extra blankets
cleaning stuff all of my candles garbage
bags my yoga mat so I can you just grab
it and go then this store if you guys
were curious the door that the chair is
against that's the door to upstairs but
it's like completely locked like it's
unusable so the next is just the
bookshelf and it's in between the two
doors here and it's just got like my
slippers not these ones because I'm
wearing them but slippers dog toys that
stuff is full of like filming supplies
and accessories in stuff like that books
books books and then just my puller
camera my other camera usually sits on
that side and that has more important
papers and just random stuff in it so
this door is actually the door to the
bathroom and the bathroom is probably
the least nicest room in the apartment I
don't know it's just kind of dated I
guess but so yeah this is the bathroom I
got perfumes and stuff on that side and
candles and the merry cookie soap more
candles if you guys aren't surprised I
have like this thing here from if you
guys have been subscribed to me for a
very long time you'll know I got that in
college because it was in my college
dorm tour thingy whatever and then I
have this on here too that says the
bathroom rules which obviously is just
for show I don't actually have bathroom
rules and then of course like there
that's a closet was like all my makeup
and hair stuff in it and then the shower
yeah not really a cool bathroom it
anyway so then obviously next is the
kitchen and it's fair
open-concept which I love so I will
start on this side and sorry if it's
kind of dark this is just a table with
two stools obviously the the table is
from JISC and the stools are from excess
cargo so these Christmas placemats are
from Ryan's mom these roses are from
Ryan and then I have two candles one is
tis the season and the other one is warm
caramel cider and I flip back and forth
between burning those and then of course
bananas so then hanging up on the wall
is this black in my picture that says
espresso and then underneath it I just
have my garbage can and Bentley's two
dog food and dog water bowl then there's
obviously self-explanatory oven I feel
like this is really weird that I'm
showing you guys this stuff cupboards my
Keurig coffee nice block toaster more
cupboards 4 Ridge broken microwave
because you guys again know how obsessed
I am with coffee and of course all my
coffee mugs as well so and then if you
turn this way this is like the little
island kind of it's not really an island
but we're going to call it that on
kitchen counter which has like the sink
and the washing thing since I don't have
a dishwasher so the next of course in
here is our bedroom which I'm sure you
guys have seen if you watched my target
videos but I'll do another pan and zoom
and give you guys a better look at what
our bedroom looks like
so on the nightstand I just have this
wire bird a three wick candle and this
lamp the bedding and pillows and
everything are all from Target it's just
white bedding with a gray knitted
blanket it's like green white kind of
and same with this little breakfast tray
table it's got my laptop on it for when
I'm like using my laptop in bed or
drinking coffee or eating food in bed
because that's not live we all do it so
those are the pillows that I have they
kind of remind me of pajamas I don't
know why and then over there it's just
the hamper a really dirty bookshelf so
on the bookshelf itself is a digital
picture frame which has pictures I was
like my friends and I and all that stuff
a candle a another candle a picture of
my Nana and Papa when they were really
really young which I think you guys saw
in my old room tour and then just this
black phase with white fake roses in it
a bag of clothes to go to Goodwill and
then curtains of course picture frames
and stuff I'm sorry guys I really didn't
clean before doing this here is my
clothing rack which I have like all the
stuff I've been wearing most or stuff
that's in season on it and like hats and
coats and stuff shoes of course on the
bottom Bentley's kennel there's more
shoes in there and then of course and
more shoes down here this is all stuff
that literally doesn't fit in the closet
or stuff I'm about to film a video on
we're stuff I just haven't found a place
for yet so it's super messy and then
there is of course the dresser and the
TV and there's me so here's just a
better view of the dresser with the TV
on it and then there's a black mirror
beside that and then the door of course
the closet as well and the door to go
back out to the apartment oh and over my
bed I also have just this like I think
it's the Brooklyn Bridge I could be
wrong but that is over the bed and then
you walk back out and you're back in the
main apartment so it's pretty small but
it's perfect for what I need and that is
pretty much the complete tour alright
guys that is my complete apartment tour
I hope you guys enjoyed again keep in
mind it's not anything too elegant or
shopping it but it is something I wanted
to share with you guys since you
requested it if you guys have any more
video requests feel free to leave them
down below and other than that I will
see you guys all in a future video
