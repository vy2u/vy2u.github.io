obsessions I know I did
a February obsessions for the month of
February obviously and it was a hit and
you guys really seemed to like it so I
think I'm gonna be doing these every
other month so the next one would be
June anyways I'm going to just dive
right in and show you guys some of the
things that I've been obsessing over for
the month of April that said I just want
you guys to take a quick look at the
surroundings in this video because this
is probably going to be the last video
filmed in this spot in this location and
in this apartment so that's a little bit
sad but um when it comes to change is
that instead of focusing on like the old
you have to try and just put all of your
energy into the new so I'm trying not to
get too sad about it and just think
about all the opportunities and things
to come with this new change but yeah I
just wanted to let you guys know to just
take a good last look at this little
scenery or setup alright so I'm going to
jump right in and share with you guys my
April obsession and I'm going to be
showing you some beauty slash non beauty
related things because I don't know it's
more like a lifestyle obsession so I'm
just gonna jump right in so starting
with makeup the foundation that I used
me most for the month of April was my
maybelline superstay makeup and this is
in the color it is in the color true
beige and it is a 24 hour wear
foundation I'm wearing it right now
actually I do really like this
foundation it is pretty much like I say
medium to high coverage that's 24 hours
but I found it starts to get a little
bit blotchy towards the end of the day
if I'm doing my makeup at like 8:00 in
the mornings but other than that it is
really really good I find it completely
evens out my skin tone and I've just
been loving it so that is the first
obsession for the month of April my next
obsession for the month of April with my
Too Faced bronzer and this is in
chocolate Soleil this has been my most
used bronzer this month and the thing
that I love most about it is the smell
of it that's really weird and you guys
know I'm a big scent person so when
something smells good I love it so this
is the bronzer I've been using again I'm
wearing it right now and it's just a
nice matte bronzer and I love the finish
of it it's very smooth it doesn't look
too fake on your skin or anything and it
blends really
nicely so this has been my favorite
bronzer for haircare you guys know that
I've been growing my hair back out
luckily it's been growing a lot faster
lately and I've just been taking really
good care of it and trying my best not
to use heat on it and basically just try
to nurture as much as possible so that
it continues to grow so the shampoo and
conditioner duo that I've been trying
out for the month of April and I'm
obsessed with it is my Pantene expert
collection and it is the dry defies
shampoo and conditioner I love this
stuff not only does it smell amazing but
especially the conditioner I'll leave
just a little bit in on my ends when I
get out of the shower and my hair is
just like I can't explain to you guys it
feels amazing as you guys know I was
recently in Dominican you leave the
conditioner in her hair that being my
sister and I before we would head to
like the beach or the pool or anything
throughout the day because as you guys
know in really humid climates especially
blonde hair it starts to get very strong
like so will you leave just a little
dollop of this conditioner in our hair
and it would still feel amazing by the
end of the day like you could run your
fingers right through it so I absolutely
love the shampoo and conditioner
my next obsession has been my makeup
forever mascara as you guys know I'm not
someone that like obsesses over super
high-end brands of makeup but holy
smokes this mascara is my life I love
the formula of it and I love the brush
um so someone that normally likes more
of a bushy brush rather than like the
thinner more like spikey brushes and
this has completely changed my outlook
on spikey brushes with mascara it gives
like the best separated but also lots of
volume lashes you just have to be
careful not to put too too many coats
because it can get clumpy but I only put
about two maybe three coats if I'm going
somewhere special and it has been
amazing so it's the makeup forever and
smoky stretch and it's a mascara
extension and definition so it is
amazing and it's definitely worth the
investment so now we're moving into some
more non beauty related things the next
obsession I've had for the month of
April was my o oo ahoo ahoo coconut
sunset candle from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I
apologize if I said that wrong
is amazing it smells so good and as you
guys know I'm a huge beach bum so I love
anything that smells like the beach not
to mention the jar is ombre which is
another thing I'm obsessed with it's
basically me and a candle with my two
favorite colors it smells so so so good
and I've been burning it a lot since
I've been back from Dominican because
feeling a little bit nostalgic so I
highly recommend if you're looking for a
new candle to go check this one out
because it smells unreal next I'm going
to show you guys my favorite pair of
sunglasses for April again if you guys
have been watching like the videos and
the pictures and stuff from Dominican
you will have seen these before were
actually got these from everyone planet
but you can find very very similar ones
off of the Charlotte Russe website and I
know that because I tagged them on my
blog so these have been the sunglasses
I've been obsessed with I love this like
how it's kind of mirrored or reflected
and it's got like a pinky Orange II kind
of color scheme going on in there anyway
and aviators in general I just love them
but I would say especially in Dominican
these were my most worn sunglasses along
with the brown ones that I always wear
are the tortoise ones sorry that I
always wear if you're probably gonna be
seeing me wear these quite a bit this
year
my next obsession has been my little
tumblr Cup which you guys may have seen
in my spring foundation routine or on
Instagram so I got this little choose to
be happy kind of Maison tumblr cut from
Blogilates website and I just really
liked it because I'm obsessed with the
like kind of mason jar looking cups
lately and I like making iced coffee in
these with my Keurig but I also just
loved it because it said choose to be
happy which is obviously something that
I always tried to kind of like promote
so I just loved a little quote on the
front and it's in like such a pretty
Tiffany blue or teal blue color so I
picked up this little tumbler Cup I'll
leave a link to it down below but it has
definitely been one of my obsessions
from April and I've been using it almost
every single day whether it be for water
or ice coffee so this has been another
obsession of mine and of course how
could we forget fashion I hope you guys
have seen my spring lookbook by now but
these are the little booties that I was
wearing quite often in them and these
are life I got these from forever 21 and
I have been looking for a little pair of
booties like this for a very long time
in this kind of color
I pretty much wear these almost with any
outfit for the past month other than
when I was in Dominican I didn't bring
them to Dominican but other than that
one week I've pretty much worn these
with almost every single outfit because
they are so cute for spring and summer
so these are the little booties that I
have Ben was obsessed with and I just
love the fringe up on the front and I'm
actually wearing them today with this
outfit as for books I ended up finishing
the book uninvited which I posted a
picture to on Twitter when I told you
guys I was reading it I have a picture
here of the second one which is called
unleashed which is the one I'm halfway
through right now but I don't have the
first one here to show you guys because
it's packed away since I am moving to
the best I could and figured I'd pull up
the picture of the second one so I had
at least something to physically show
you guys but yes the book uninvited it's
by Sophie Jordan and I tweeted about
reading it it was also in a book haul or
a recent haul video of mine so that is
the book that I recently read and I
highly recommend it you guys it was so
good I could not stop reading it could
not put it down I believe it's in the
year 2020 and scientists have made it
now that you can get tested to see if
you have like a kill gene which means
that you're going to be a killer in your
life and this girl who's just like
perfect straight-a student has like
basically the most perfect life ever and
she's very like sweet she's a musician
she's very quiet she ends up getting the
kill gene or finds out that she has the
kill gene and it's about her life from
there on out because people with the
kill chain are treated very differently
it sounds different but it's very very
good I highly recommend it for those of
you that like that type of like teen
fiction type novels it was such a good
book and I could not put it down and
let's just say that I love Sean also if
you guys watch Sons of Anarchy I picture
Sean in the book as Jax from sense of
Anarchy that is actually why I love Sean
in the book but anyway just read the
book and you guys know what I'm talking
about I swear my favorite show for the
month of April I have been getting
pressured from my sister and some from
some friends and from subscribers just
just kind of like finally watch Grey's
Anatomy so I finally gave it a chance
more recently like two more towards the
end of April but I can't stop
watching it so I finally understand what
you guys meant aka Maggie Kira mineka
and all of you subscribers and kept
telling me to watch it I finally get it
I didn't really I wasn't hooked right
away in the first episode
it wasn't till about like the second or
third episode where I was like okay next
one next one next one next one then I
was like well I probably shouldn't work
on some videos who do something
different with my life
so yeah my favorite show for the month
of April has been Grey's Anatomy as for
my favorite quote for the month of April

this video so um if you guys want to
