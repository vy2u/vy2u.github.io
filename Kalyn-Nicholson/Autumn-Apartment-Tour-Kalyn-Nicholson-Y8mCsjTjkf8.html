welcome back to my channel today is the
8th day of u Tober I hope you guys have
been enjoying all of the videos so far
we are now leading into week 2 and for
today's video I am going to be doing a
fall apartment tour I haven't done an
apartment tour since the summer time I
figured it'd be a fun one to add into
youtuber especially since not only had a
lot of my furniture been rearranged and
moved around because I do that like
literally every two months also because
I've been adding to pour everywhere or
the fall / Halloween time so if you're
going to be fun and cozy to share with
you guys my little cloud that is my
apartment for the fall time without
further ado if you guys want to tour my
apartment then just keep watching so
this is the overall view you see when
you first walk in and this is still
generally the same as my last apartment
tour little rug is from society6 up here
I still have the same thing from Walmart
it's just a bunch of hooks beside the
door I just have Bentley's kettle and
that's where I put like my bags and then
right beside that I have this little
seating area these two little cubicle
things they're from Walmart and then
filled them with pieces of decor some of
them don't really make sense but a lot
of them are vintage cameras that I got
off of like eBay and things like that
this horse head here is from Walmart I
have a warm tobacco-pipe candle which
smells amazing and it's like completely
black and then beside that I have these
Brooklyn Bridge bookends that I got from
Walmart and in between there all of my
workbooks above that I have this
Brooklyn Bridge photo that I also got
from Walmart about two years ago and
then I just strung some wire lighting
around it and then this lamp is also
from Walmart everything over in this
area is literally from Walmart beside
that I just have this nightstand that
holds my popcorn machine that I got from
my dad for my birthday beside that I
have my bar table and bar stools so the
bar table is from yes and the stools are
from just like a liquidation store and
right on top I have this fake plant from
home scents and then autumn by Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works and my
laptop and I will also link this skin
down below so the beside the dining room
table is my living room I'll give you
guys a bit of an overview before I go
into detail so my couch is from Ikea and
I'll leave a link to it down below it's
just this l-shaped couch and I actually
recently switched out the pillows for
fall so this orange one here is from
home since and I'm not sure if that was
there in my last tour but this is also
from home sense the autumn pillow is
again from home scents and the rest of
them are just like the marble ones from
before and then I also have this like
white fur throw on top of one of the
cushions which again is from home scents
above my couch I have my New York City
tapestries beside that I just have a
nightstand ently you could not have
planned this any better on top of that I
have this wooden slack that Maggie and I
actually took from a restaurant to be
honest and then these two candles one of
them is pumpkin marshmallow then I have
this little pumpkin guy which is from
HomeSense underneath the side table is
just Bentley's little toy box so then in
front of my couch I just have this rug
that is from Ikea as well as my coffee
table on top I just have this light
sandalwood box that's got dusty colored
roses and flowers in it and I put three
pumpkin spice candles in and then I just
have my TV on top and my little plant
hanging from the ceiling the candles I
currently have beside my TV are five
o'clock shadow in station 22 I thought
they looked kind of like autumn festive
next to my TV unit I just popped orange
flower in the space and then next to
that I have my full-length mirror which
is from JISC and then just above my
mirror I have my gallery wall which is
the same as in my last apartment tour I
believe I di wide this gallery wall in
an old summer morning routine so if I
can find the link I will put it
somewhere on the screen if not down
below and then really quickly over here
I have my back patio the curtains are
from hisk so I have a two seater bar
table from Walmart with this candle on
top and then just a mine in Bentley's
pumpkin and the store mat which is from
yes and an outdoor plant so that is the
gist of my living room so leading you
guys now into the kitchen I have these
sunflowers that I got from the grocery
store as well and autumn day from Bath
and Body Works nothing much has really
changed in my kitchen everything is
still generally the same as in my last
tour the only things that I think have
changed is up here I strung these lights
that are from
HomeSense and it just gives it like a
cozier vibe on top of my fridge I have
this like autumn bouquet that I got from
the dollar store actually and then this
banner that says thankful is from
HomeSense and leading into the first
bedroom here this is like my filming
room slash closet very multifunctional I
have a video actually coming for you
Tober where it's going to be like a full
fall closet tour so I won't go into too
much detail but I will give you guys a
general overview a closet sectional here
is actually from Ikea in the buckets are
things like t-shirts like cozy sweaters
skirts pants those are where I keep
those things because I do not have a
dresser and then the rest of the shelves
are just filled with booties and shoes
and then on top I have all of my dresses
and wrappers for the fall time and in
the middle just some jackets and then on
top of that is all of my bigger bags and
inside I just have a hamper and like
again a few more drawers for bathing
suits and shorts and stuff like that and
then next to the closet are these
mirrors they were actually installed in
this room when I moved in so I'm not too
sure where they're from but I think I've
seen similar ones from Walmart off to
the side on the door I have this like
over the door hanger and on there I just
keep some of my smaller purses and bags
my robes by Victoria Secret laptop bag
and some hats and then over to the side
this is new since last time I ended up
hanging up this rod from Ikea with
little buckets and then above that I
have this canvas that I actually got
from a yes last year and then on top of
that are the letters the light-up
letters that I actually got when I went
to the Toronto Film Fest so down below I
have this chest slash ottoman that I got
from HomeSense
and inside I keep a bunch of materials
for DIYs and like extra blankets for
guests and on top of that I just keep
some up-and-coming outfits whether I'm
going to be filming them soon so right
beside that I just have my Beauty desk
area so the desk itself and the drawers
are actually from Ikea I won't go into
what's in all the drawers since that'll
be in my youtuber like fall closet tour
but on top I just keep my perfume some
lipsticks and like eyeliners and brow
pencils and then on the desk itself I
have
these two makeup mirrors the crisp
morning air hands cream my two favorite
nail polishes right now and a speaker
for what I'm getting ready and a candle
and this is usually burning when I'm
filming and then beside my desk area is
this bookshelf I actually purchased this
from Walmart and it has all of my high
heels so that is it for my closet
filming room so next to this bedroom
when you come out and move to the second
door this is my bedroom
I recently rearranged all of the
furniture so it's going to look
different than last time I toured it for
you guys
and then I have my guitar and kind of
like my TV unit system but behind it I
just have this tapestry it's from
society6 my fireplace I get asked this a
lot it is from Rona and then I have my
TV my cable box on the floor beside
there I have my records for my record
player and my Wii and then this cubical
thing here so on the very very top I
have my record player and sitting on top
of that is sweater weather by Bath and
Body Works and then in the first cube I
have this little vase and pink flowers
from home scents um next to that I have
the kiss me goodnight I bought this from
my local market as well as a light-up
crystal that changes color and then next
to that is the photo that I have had and
pretty much every single one of my
apartment tours of my Nana and Papa in a
photo booth when they were really young
and then when you turn around this is my
bed area so I'll start with the
nightstand my bed and nightstand are
actually from JISC and I get asked this
a lot so on my nightstand I just have my
candy corn candle that I got from home
cents a mini pumpkin from the grocery
store and this deer that I picked up
from Walmart and then above that I have
my dream board which I will leave a link
to the video where I did this down below
so as for my bed my bedding is from home
sense I actually recently picked it up
usually my bed is kind of like a
minefield of dog toys this one this one
and this one are all from society6 the
orange one is from HomeSense the two
behind that the bigger ones they're like
half concrete those are also from
society 6 and then the quilted pillows
came with the bedding and then the big
giant grey pillows are from HomeSense as
well and above my bed I still have the
little skyline that I made and then next
to my bed I have my desk area so the
desk is from ikea on top of my desk
right now

pumpkin cupcake from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
this is like a serving dish that I got
from home cents and on top of that I
have this is also from home cents and as
all of like my pens and my highlighters
so this lamp here is from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond the really cool thing about is it
has a place for like your USB and to
like plug things in and then beside that
I have all of my post-it notes for my
post at Wal which you guys will see in a
second and this coaster which is
actually a lid from a candle and then of
course my computer and like I said my
post at wall which is basically just how
I keep my life completely organized this
is like a new post-it note thing that
I've kind of incorporated to keep on
track and I don't know just a better
organized so if it ends up sticking then
I'll do a video on it and show you guys
and then we have my closet so that is it
for my bedroom when you turn and come
out of there next to that is just my
bathroom and again not much has changed
since I last showed you guys down below
I have my little Buddha this guy is from
HomeSense and then in front of him are a
bunch of crystals that Marissa Lise
actually gave me from her light love and
lace store for soap right now I have my
marshmallow pumpkin latte because duh
it's fall and these little candles are
from Target two years ago and then I
have a pumpkin spice candle and I'm not
too sure where this guy's from this
little guy here he's actually from the
Dominican and he was carved out of
coconut and I bought him on the trip I
went to with my sister and he's supposed
to bring your home good luck so I have
him in here kind of fits like the
wanderlust vibe that is my bathroom so I
have him in here and then this bucket
here is just full of like products and
my shower curtain is from society6 again

is the full tour of what is mine and
Bentley's apartment and all of the
