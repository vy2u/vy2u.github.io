guys can know and we can all come and
hang out day yeah be sure to come check
it out my first live stream is actually
going to be tonight
and other than that let's jump into the
fall tech so question number one is your
favorite thing about fall I'm going to
stay like overall I think my favorite
thing about fall is that it's the
coziest season and as you guys probably
know by now
like cozy is my middle name colors the
crisp weather blankets and handles all
of the fall things that equate to being
cozy is everything I love about fall
number two what is your favorite fall
slash Halloween movies I live one for
each because in the fall time when it's
not quite close enough to be Halloween
yeah like maybe end of September early
October I like to watch the Harry Potter
movies because I feel like they just
have such a fall vibe to them as for
Halloween movies I have to say I think
of all time my favorite would be
Halloween town it's just such a classic
it's like it's not even like that great
of a movie it just brings you back to
being like a kid and watching it on the
Disney Channel
a fashion trend you're loving for fall
you see I'm really digging the neutral
tones like the tans and taupe sand like
baby Pink's and I'm also really really
really diggin thigh high boots with like
a cute little sweater dress number four
is your favorite fall drinks so if I'm
making a drink at home I just like plain
old coffee it with cinnamon in it if I'm
ordering a drink which is usually from
Starbucks I like to get these skinny
cinnamon Dolce latte with coconut milk
you guys can totally thank me later bye
what is fall weather like where you live
so I currently live in Canada very close
to Toronto the mornings are really crisp
and cool and there's usually like
condensation on the cars and the grass
it drops down to about I would say it
ranges anywhere between like 10 to 15
degrees in the fall time here which I'm
not sure what that is in Fahrenheit but
I'll pop that up somewhere on the screen
all the trees change color love Canada
in the fall time six apple picking or
hay ride and I don't think I've done
here right since I was like really
little so I'm gonna say apple picking
demin rain or fog ooh if it's closer to
Halloween I want to say fog but for the
rest of autumn rain eight hocus pocus or
Halloween Town Halloween Town area said
that was my fave number nine is corn
maze or haunted house all dogs really
hard because I like that corn mazes are
outside but I love haunted houses so
that's 10 Halloween or Thanksgiving this
is another really hard one Thanksgiving
where I'm from is before Halloween so
the other bonus of Thanksgiving is that
you're still getting excited for
Halloween so Thanksgiving is my favorite
11 is coats or oversized sweaters and
I'm definitely sticking with oversized
sweater 12 is apple pie or pumpkin pie
and without a doubt no questions asked
pumpkin pie 13 is cool crisp mornings or
cozy evenings I just don't think it's
very fair to make me have to choose
between these two I love love love
morning time in the fall I love when
it's like foggy and cold and just waking
up and like brewing yourself a warm
mother coffee but I also love watching
like Halloween movies at night and
bundling up with a bunch of blankets and
after like a long days of work so it's
just not picking one I'm gonna go with
both 14 is your favorite foam candle
sweet wise it would be pumpkin caramel
swirl and like the more Colonia type
smells I would either go with autumn or
actually you know what sweater weather
is a real big favor of mine right now
and number 15 is your favorite thing to
do in the fall time I think one of my
favorite things to do in the fall is to
make a really really good playlist and
either read some sort of book that kind
of fits the fall theme or to drive
around and find really cool fall
photography to take there's something
about that's just like calmness that
calm is when reading a really good book
while listening to music or driving
around it breaks my heart that I'm a
winter baby I feel like I was meant to
be a fall baby fact this coffee is still
warm everything was gone right today so
that is it for the fall tech I have for
you guys I hope you guys are enjoying
each other so far it has been such a
hectic month with all the videos but
