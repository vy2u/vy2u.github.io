first vlog on a Monday so happy new
Monday upload day you waving at mo yeah
when he started to get in the car this
morning I woke up way later than I
planned to and it was just one of those
morning's where I kept hitting snooze
but I did finally get up so I went for a
run this morning
I had bananas for breakfast then I
packed for camping with this one pack in
terms of camping what I will okay so
I've got a bathing suit it's a pants
tapestry towel hopefully I don't need
much more than that and then I went and
picked up Christine who is chillin
beside me okay we look like cops okay
again um I do go home sometimes I
dropped off that Lea at my mom's house
come on me today w I'll see you later

while we camp and then we ended up
hitting up Walmart yes which was fun
that's charcoal we need firewood where's
the firewood where's the chapstick or
nine dollar chair look at that chair
that firestarters only two dollars away
sure we get more than one I feel like we
should count this might have more than
one in it 24 fire lies at the cheap one
oh we should get stuff for s'mores
and then Starbucks grande sugar-free
hazelnut coconut out me stove strip

that's how we camp the most basic
campers ever has really mad because they
tried to say my name is Chrissy and they

enough pretty much like what I'm having
it how do you feel about being in the
woods um well I am naturally a very
outdoorsy kind of girl okay how you

actually could be something we could
just live outside just like be one of
nature
Thanks
he falls
after treating
this far
so I'm officially back from camping my
memory card on this camera totally
filled up last night so I ended up
logging whatever was left of the night
of camping on my phone um we ended up
going to sleep I had terrible sleeps
this was such a last-minute trip that
honestly we pretty much slept on the
hard ground so then I woke up and we
drove into town very close to where we
were camping we grabbed like McDonald's
I'm basically like a hash brown and a
coffee then went back to the campsite
and took everything down and the yeah it
was just we took some cool drone footage
and then we hit the road home hopped the
ferry drove home and then when I was
going to drop Christine off I was like
oh my gosh I'm craving sushi right now
so we quickly stopped and sat down and
had like a really really quick sushi so
I just got home I switched into some
comfier clothes and I'm going to upload
all of this footage to my computer right
now and edit my first Monday vlogs every
Monday there are going to be a video
just like this one uploaded to my
channel so let me know if you guys like
that idea by thumbs in this up or
letting me know down below when I
pictured my summer this year I pictured
doing things like what last night was
and it was just such a low-key fun night

life Monday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
