on self tanning I know a lot of people
don't agree with tanning either in
tanning beds or tanning upside with the
Sun because it is pretty harmful for
your skin there are some benefits some
pros and cons for me when I tan I dunno
it isn't good for my skin and it is
going to pre age my skin when I'm older
I'm going to have wrinkles a lot a lot a
sooner and I'll probably have sunspots
as well but the way I kind of look at it
is the pros and cons are a it does clear
up a couple skin conditions that I have
and B it does make me feel more
confident with myself I find my
complexion my hair color my eye color I
just I find I look better with a little
bit of a glow so I don't go overboard
with tanning whatsoever but um once the
Sun starts to come out I stop tanning so
much in tanning beds and start doing a
little bit more self tanning and tanning
its side at the beach and stuff and such
so I just want to show you guys some
self tanners that I swear by and ones
that I think if you guys are trying to
stay away from tanning and want to have
a little bit of a glow this spring and
summer then I definitely think you're
going to work for you so for face
tanners I'm going to show you guys the
good the bad and the best because I have
three here to show you guys and I'm
going to tell you guys the pros and cons
of all of them and kind of recommend
what when I would go for if I were you
so the first one is the Jergens a lot of
people try this the dragon's natural
glow daily facial moisturizer it's for
medium to tan and it has SPF 20 that's
the awesome thing about this is you can
throw this on and it's going to have
some SPF on your skin and you protect
your skin a little bit I mean awesome
obviously SPF 20 isn't protected enough
for your skin but it's going to protect
it pretty well from the Sun and it's the
thing I think I like about this is with
the SPF you can put it on underneath
your makeup as a moisturizer and it's
one of those tans that kind of develops
so the more you use it the darker your
skin gets it shows right here but the
only thing is
not a big fan of developing tans because
I find it first they're not really doing
anything and then they kind of go
blotchy on my skin I find developing
ones so I like ones that instantly show
up but this is good for putting all my
tattoos as well when I'm tanning and
what else
I know it's just okay it's good to put
on underneath your makeup I guess the
only thing is isn't I don't like the
smell of this either it smells
absolutely horrible I hate the smell of
this and I hate the smell of it being on
my skin but the other benefit from this
one too is that it isn't it is pretty
quite it's quite inexpensive so I mean
it's got its pros it's got its cons it
smells funny but it's got SPF it's
develops but you know it still gives you
a bit of color and it's pretty
inexpensive but it smells really bad
again so you guys can choice went out
for yourself but like I'm going to keep
it but and use it every now and then but
I don't use it too often okay so next
I'm going to show you guys is the
bonnibel gel bronze and I actually just
purchased this today and tried it in my
get ready with me I'll put a clip of
that in right here
you
the thing I like about this one is it
gives you color instantly and it was
only like four dollars and I just
dropped it and I don't feel like bending
down to get it but it gives you color
instantly it was only four dollars but
yeah so I don't really have anything bad
to say about that one okay and I said I
wanted to show you guys those ones
because those ones are the one that I
would recommend if you don't like
spending a lot of money on things but um
one last one I'm going to show you is a
little bit higher end and this is the
Stila one-step bronze äj--
skin tone eliminating bronzing serum so
you can put this one on underneath your
skin or mix it with a bit of foundation
and it's going to instantly add a nice
tan to your skin this one though I did
end up getting for $10 because there was
this huge sale on at my local drugstore
and you could get a couple stealer
products for $10 each so I did end up
purchasing this for only $10 but I
believe in reality it's quite expensive
so um yeah so this is that and this one
works amazing this one works very very
well and you can just mix it in with
your foundation and it's going to add a
lot of color to your skin so I would
recommend this one too but if you don't
want to spend a lot of money than I
would definitely recommend this one
above all but just so you know neither
of these have SPF in them so okay so I
used this self-tanner for prom two years
ago and then I used it for my own prom
and I just love it I ended up using it
all throughout the summer and even when
I was pretty tanned I would put this on
over top of my tan just kind of even out
my tan and it is insane and I'm actually
going to show you guys what this one is
I have tried so many self tanners and
this one is by far the best I'm not sure
if it's available in all countries I
would think it is um but I got it from
Walmart you can get it from Shoppers
Drug Mart you can get from one where I'm
sure you could probably get it from
Target and um this one is I think it was
$14 at at Walmart yeah I was $14.99 I
think but um it's water-resistant - it
was either I was going to get this one
or the deep the deepest color there was
and I was like ooh that's cool but then
I was like oh that one's not
water-resistant so the only thing I
would say is I would definitely get the
water resistant ones because you don't
not only is it going to be
to waterproof but I mean the non
water-resistant ones I found sometimes
if you brushed up against something it
would kind of come off especially if you
brush up against um something white or I
don't know it kind of come off with like
a chalky texture so not a chalky texture
but like you can see it so these ones
are resist are like smudge proof so
they're not going to smudge off on
anything so I would definitely try this
and I'm going to show you guys basically
how this one works I'm just going to
show you guys on my arm for now you pop
off the top and it's a spray you can
spray it straight on your skin but I
find it works better if you spray it on
your hands and rub it on and then wash
your hands off after also you want to
make sure your skin is quite moisturized
because it's not going to spread it
evenly and it's going to stick in the
dry spots if you don't always ties your
skin so when I got out of the shower I
did moisturize my skin quite fairly so
I'm going to show you guys I'm just
going to shake it up a little bit and
then sprayed on my hand
and that's what it looks like you guys
can see that and then rub it on so you
guys can see that color
it's like instantaneous color see look
at that and it looks so good it makes
your skin look so um I don't even know
like it looks like it's um see um
seamless or flawless I don't you know it
just doesn't look like it makes it it I
can't toggle I do this at the same time
it makes your skin look like it's got
equal coverage and even it makes your
skin look even evens out your skin tone
and it adds so much color looks so
pretty
but yeah so you want to make sure you do
this like in front of me or too so you
can check to make sure you don't miss
any spots or lines or anything um yes
I'm going to put this in my armpit
because I don't want to have lines but
yeah so look at how much darker my arms
just went from the rest of my body so it
is really good self-tanner and I highly
recommend it and I'm going to do the
rest of my body and then show you guys
what ends up looking like okay so I just
finished putting it on don't mind my
outfit okay I haven't changed my clothes
yet because I have yet to do my laundry
but yeah so this is kind of a colour it
gave me I didn't really give you guys
much of a before but it is quite good
color and the other thing I like about
it too is it kind of blurs your
imperfections now um you guys can't see
it right now but I do have a skin
condition and there is some scarring and
some stuff on my skin and you can't tell
because once I rubbed in the self-tanner
it blurs it it like airbrushes it away
which is I'm sure why it's called
airbrush legs it is just for your legs
by the way it says that on the bottle
but um I know quite a few people that
use it isn't all over her self tanner so
it works really really well and yeah
I've cut I put it on my neck and I
didn't blur this one okay so some tips
for it um like that if you just saw a
line see a line or somewhere you forgot
to blur just kind of try and rub it in
with your fingers if it's already dry
just take a little bit of moisturizer
and moisturize that area and it should
kind of moist it or give some text some
oh you guys know what we're doing have a
say right now um it's gonna kind of just
lather up and add some more moisture to
that area and it's going to be able to
spread again it's going to get it more
less dry yeah so this is a self tanner
that I'm definitely gonna be using like
probably almost everyday this summer so
I can stop tanning so much if you guys
are wondering what's like what I meant
by I have some skin conditioning
conditions that um that tanning or sun
tanning
clears up I have rosacea on my face
which is one thing and that's just I
have red blotchiness
all over my skin and it kind of goes
through phases where it goes
really bad and it was kind of okay again
so self-tanning and not self-tanning Sun
tanning actually helps clear that up
another thing I have is a Exuma on my
skin and um tanning also gets rid of
that so the exam is like the bumps and
the red red dots it looks like little
red dots all over it clears that up I
still have a little bit of bumps but um
tanning sun tanning actually clears up a
lot of that and then the scars that I
have left over from that um this thing
covers up perfectly like my skin looks
quite quite seamless if I do say so
myself and I just said that with a lisp
um so yeah so this wouldn't cover that
really well and then the last thing that
I have is I tend to get pretty bad back
knee that sounds really gross but with
working out and the fact that I am
bigger in this general area so I do have
to wear a bra like every day all the
time and I love sports bras any one I
don't know what you guys anyone that
tends to have tends to have bigger boobs
um I find we all just love sports bras
because they just they pull them back
and they just secure them they place
them in there and they're stuck in there
and they flatten them out and they
should make me feel so much comfortable
more comfortable they're so much more
comfortable than normal bra sports bras
so I wear to us all the time and sports
bras are usually razor backed so that
part of my back is isn't getting up to
breathe as much so that kind of
contributes to that as well and then
tanning completely clears that up for me
like my back is pretty much clear right
now from Sun tanning and I've only gone
a couple times so that's the awesome
thing as well so those are the three
skin conditions that Sun tanning gets
rid of but um if you guys aren't a big
Sun tanner
or like tanning and tanning bed standing
by the Sun self tanners or going to be
your best friend and these are the ones
that I would recommend they don't make
you orange they don't make you look
funny or uneven they work really really
well you just have to have the patience
to do it after you shower because once
you shower all of this stuff will come
off and you'll have to start over again
except for this one this one apparently
gradually tans your skin but I wouldn't
trust that you probably won't be able to
tell very much
so that is it for my self-tanning video
happy tanning all of you people whether
you're self tanning or sun tanning happy
safe tanning is what I meant to say um
and good luck with your summer glows and
yeah so thank you guys for watching I'll
see you guys in a new video in an all
video what in a new video very very soon
