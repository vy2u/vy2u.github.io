for today's video
it's an exciting one and I'm sure you
guys already know it from the title but
I am doing a Coachella flow here in Los
Angeles soon to be Palm Springs for
Coachella and yes I'm vlogging it for
you guys so I'm still running off of
three hours of sleep I got a super
freakin early this morning got a solid
two mass three hours of sleep maybe I'm
an idiot but I am already currently 5:30
in the morning also if you guys are
curious real quick today's outfit the
tires vintage Indiana crewneck that I
got from brandy melville some black
Lululemon leggings use the ones are
supposed to feel like you're naked and
confirm and then my red sneakers from
adidas because I felt like matching
today hit the plane made it here and
kind of hung out for a bit I'll just you
know what cut to the b-roll
yeah
oh I think okay the children time so
yeah I'm currently in Los Angeles we go
to Palm Springs tomorrow I'm here with
keels and urban decay which huge thank
you to you guys for bringing me here
honestly I'm so frickin honored and so
blessed and so frickin excited we went
to the keel store earlier today and we
got to do this like cool thing where we
like mapped our skin and like on our
faces and stuff like that update I'm
super dehydrated and I have a lot of sun
damage but and then I just thought ready
we're heading it to a little healed
party that I have no idea where it's at
exactly if I'm being honest with you but
I'm also running late so I really need
to run downstairs yeah I don't know it
feels kind of fundamental that this is
the beginning of the story of Coachella
and like I have no idea what's to come
but I'm assuming from the b-roll Clips
that you may have seen in this intro
that it's going to be pretty hype and
you guys have seen it all before I have
so as for what I'm wearing it to the
party I'm just wearing my leather jacket
this dress is from Shope oh it's like a
wraparound dress and then I'm just
wearing like little gladiator sandals my
hair is really greasy so it slips it
back into a ponytail and yeah heading up
super early having some breakfast and
driving to Palm Springs and we're going
to stop on the way and do like this
ranch photo shoot I'm also super bloated
right now from all the vegan that we
went to this like vegan Mexican place
and I saw Cody Simpson there by the way
I'll insert the snapchat that I took
very discretely because I didn't want to
be that person that bothered him but
like so I'm super bloated from that so
thank God this dress is kind of loose so
yeah let's head to this Kiehl's party
and then you know let's head to the
desert
Hugh's my cryogen policy arms
you keep laughing no first cup of coffee
and I spill on my brand-new white shirt
now it looks like I've lactated
and
so yeah this place is absolutely insane
so now getting close to 12:30 we're
going to head out of here we're going to
go grab some lunch at this place where
like I guess they used to film like old
50s like western videos or like movies
and stuff like that which is kind of
like ridiculously cool that it's
Coachella I still don't know what to
expect so much already happened and
Coachella hasn't even begun yet I don't
know I don't even know how to feel about
all of it
well you guys don't hear me but anyways
interest and walking back to the crowd
kind of terrifying and it's so scary
people are like shoving you in pushing
you believe decipher not everything is
so amazing I mean it we're sorry sorry
yeah it was like we walk abreast was
like I'm sorry and they're like why did
you have a quality school forever guys
why did I buy this camera also real
quick if you guys haven't already make
sure you guys check out Chris and Lana I
mean all your guys's links down below
you guys better go check them out
they're freaking insane
we were literally just doing that thing
or like we're not even drunk at all like
it's the Canadian side the comedian see
go see what else are super Coachella is
Oh
he'll be like burn your tongue good
morning so it is officially day two well
stay two of Coachella but a three that
I've been here just getting back to my
room up from grabbing breakfast with
Atlanta and I have about an hour to get
ready for brunch this is turned into
like part of the joke of the blog I'm
just going to wear this hat every single
chance I can and then we have the revolt
party which I'm probably going to wear
my Coachella issue this is such an
exciting day because today's outfit is
like my favorite outfit that I packed
for Coachella last night was super fun
but we didn't get there till pretty late
so I didn't really get to get a lot of
footage but I'm hoping that we'll get a
lot more today with the sunlight and
everything I'm having so much fun it was
absolutely amazing but the partly you
don't see on like Instagram and in vlogs
of Coachella is how bad your feet hurt
how like tight the crowd is you're
getting like pushed every which way and
how tired and exhausted you feel like I
honestly was so exact when I woke up
this morning this is going to be all
pulled together in about 3 2 1 well the
beauty of editing so it's now 11:11
we're going to head downstairs and get
some photos taken with the photographer
god bless her soul I'm going to leave
her Instagram down below definitely go
check her out but she's been taking some
wicked photos for us and then we're
going to head to brunch
[Laughter]
minutes revolve and truly nobody's going
in but a little making it we made it
happen
Oh
we totally just like ask the bouncer
just let it he totally did so we took
out the money we paid 50 bucks each and
that were like blueprint road for
college let me show you how plan for the
I figure it out it's actually saying
well
my husband so I just got back to my room
from grabbing breakfast and I just blow
dried my hair I'm going to get ready we
have to be down in the lobby for 11:30
and take our luggage and then we're
heading to an urban decay pool party
before we head to Coachella for the
third day I am like pretty exhausted I
got up actually really early today
despite the fact that we came back at
like 2:00 last night last night was
insane Brody Jenner walked by me Drake
came out on stage bonny verse just like
whole set I honestly I don't think I
talked at all that whole set I was just
swaying my soul was his and then Elena
and I we like met Veronica and Betty
from Riverdale they were like right
behind us that God I met the president
from scandal it was insane honestly it
was so much fun I don't even know if I
my body or my mind could actually handle
another day but I feel like this blog is
probably going to be so long but oh my
god it was just the most incredible
experience so we shall see what today
has in store of anticipating it I have
about an hour and a half but my hair
takes so long to do guys it's insane
I'll probably cut this vlog straight to

just gonna go like and I'm gonna be on a
pool party are you ready three two one
