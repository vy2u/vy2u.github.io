hey guys Kalyan here and for today's
video I'm going to be doing the best
friend tag and today I have my friend
here Christine so yeah this is my best
bride I guess we're just going to jump
right into the questions and I believe
fun stuff about Christine down below
like her Instagram and Twitter and stuff
cuz she tweets funny stuff and she has
cool pics
so I'm gonna start with the first
question how and when did you guys meet
okay so definitely we met in 1998 in
kindergarten which was in 1998 so JK
right yes it's Jimmy harden yeah yeah we
uh we were in the same junior
kindergarten class I'll put a picture
here that I have of us in her class
photo holding hands and the rest is
history so that was how it would pretty
much why because we went to the same
school - what's your favorite memory
together that's a toughy okay I think my
favorite memory of us together is this
one time we thought it would be really
funny to dress up as boy I knew you're
gonna be Zelan and walk around the
neighborhood like Duke a condo yeah what
was wrong with us as children we didn't
do normal childhood activities like we
did really weird stuff I'm gonna use
when we were actually talked about the
other day there was one time where she
lives now like two hours away from me
like I still live in our hometown and
she went two hours away and I was bored
to the point where I was like man do you
want to hang out and she was like yeah I
do so I drove two hours to pick her up
and drove back and we hung out like
that's that's how far our friendship
goes three describe each other in one
word I would say your mixture of weird
and funny and independent okay and funny
distributer sounds weird but like I feel
like for you I was
serious because there are so many
qualities about you that nobody like
knows until like you actually like get
to know you like kind of true what is
like you are so like some person who
might not know you might think like
you're a bit more reserved but then as
soon as you hang out I'm really just
like oh my god
yeah so probably quick can't really
think of a better word besides that just
I know okay which is funny there's kind
of things about you that nobody knew
been on YouTube you guys don't really
ever see my weird side so like she is
really light and really weird okay
number four what's your dream job um my
dream job is Beyonce she has on her
Facebook her job right now as a
Victoria's Secret Angel model or victoy
Secret Angel it's not true by the way I
probably would say YouTube to be
honestly because YouTube's like very
diverse in the sense that you can do a
lot of different things but my dream job
would probably would be do continue
YouTube but like do more but like do
more philosophy more fashion stuff or
like stuff like that either that or work
with animals we're fine what's your
favorite makeup friend I feel like we
should do one high-end brand and one
drive store brand okay so my high-end
brand would probably be mac or benefit I
was gonna definitely say benefit mostly
because the Porefessional has changed my
life and then for drugstore I would
probably say L'Oreal or Revlon yeah I
definitely would say Revlon yeah I like
that one I always have really good stuff
number six what is something that annoys
you about the other person I know my
answer this one already because ever
since we I can actually ever remember we
used to hang out so much to the point
where like I had this huge bed where I
put two beds together in grade 9 or 10
and she had an indent in her side of the
bed that's how much we hung out but she
has his twitching her foot or her foot
starts to shake all her time I was like
centrum it is a medical disease and she
is annoyed by it anyways
yes you shake certain point and my
entire bed is shaken much and I I gotta
get these twitching things when like
there's tiny little movements or little
sounds and I get like really annoyed by
it and so that is my biggest thing that
annoys it okay so kind of relating to
that something that annoys me is that
okay cuz I'm like when I eat like I'm
really like a vocal leader and like I'm
kind of a gross eater like a bit of a
slob so I didn't know it but it annoys
me but she gets annoyed at how gross of
an eater am and I can't help it
Thanks I get annoyed by like repetitive
sounds and repetitive like little
movements so the sound of her like
crunching - she'll shoot with her mouth
open I'm literally like Christine I'm
gonna kill you just stop stop okay
actually we might swing an eye thing
that noise he got hurt is this girl
which he needs to people not go to the
bathroom she will hold it for hours and
then she will dance I'm like do it and
I'm always just like man and like I know
you have to pee like I don't just be I
ain't going pee though cuz I've a small
bladder so I always have to pee so I
always try and hold it as long as
possible if you go anywhere in the world
together where would it be and why I
feel like we would go either somewhere
very very tropical or very like
entertaining where you could do a lot of
stuff somewhere that would be unreal for
us to go just because it's a something
we do a little time is go to Japan just
to get sushi oh yes again top of the
line so you ate favorite inside joke we
have a lot but like I can't think on off
the top my head oh we need to do we need
to do the mr. rush shirt right now great
7:00 we had a teacher called mr. rush
Bert he was falling on the top of his
head and he wore those really thick I'm
sorry again mr. rush brick if you are
watching this but you wore big thick
rapist glasses s kidnappers is Carrie so
we always just I think it was I forget
who's to said it first but one of us had
a dream one night that we were being
haunted by mr. rush for our teacher and
every time we'd see him he'd be like
looking at us across the wall with just
all you can see is his eyes and his nose
like it's right and his rapist glasses
still every time we see anybody like -
doing this we first I laughing and call
it the mr. rush fruit k9 who takes
longer to get ready in the morning
we probably take like the pretty much
the exact top ten favorite season I
would love to say summer because
wherever I'm like feigning summer I'm
like hey how can I say I like any season
better than summer but it always comes
back to fall and it's just because of
the warm and coziness of fall I just I
can't say I just love fall I love fall
like clothing and candles and as much as
I love summer and all the stuff you can
do in summer I love the coziness and of
fall I agree I actually literally
exactly what you just said it's exactly
what I would have said except I want to
say spring a number 11 favorite song and
my favorite song changes like every two
days so what is it it can be shot you
think and especially when you're in your
car and that comes on you is a good Jo
you automatically feel like the cool
person it is a pretty good jam I would
have to say my favorite song right now
is confident by Justin Bieber because
that's like the Jim I put on when I'm
having a bad day I put on confident by
Justin Bieber and I'm like 12 what is it
like being best friends with someone who
is obsessed or on YouTube um I feel like
people would assume that it's a lot
different than it actually is I feel
like because I've known count for so
long
even before shoes on YouTube I feel like
as a person and in their friendship it
hasn't really done much different but in
a sense it's cool because like I do live
two hours away normally and so I kinda
get to see what she's up to
when I'm not even here no but I came and
I saw that cool sure you like that's so
saying like where do you get that like
anyone can be a YouTube purchase you're
just friends with someone that yeah puts
their face up on YouTube all the time in
their home or bedroom so number 13 heels
or flats Oh heels I want to say heels
because I love heels but I forego in by
what I wear more it would be flats okay
14 pants or dresses dresses
I think I favorite say pants I feel like
I don't pull off a girly frilly look
very well so that's why I like pants
okay this is so weird but I just because
I'm so lazy you like the rest it's an
effortless effortless way to make it
seem like you put so much effort into
how you look but you did it yeah number
15 your favorite animal like I just says
that link has an animal I've always kind
of been like this is weird but like
always been because like I'm kind of
like these are just so lazy and like
that we obviously lazy the hippo just
they lay there they don't even move
together actually very aggressive I've
heard they're very shy exactly like oh I
just saw your inner spirit animal is it
hippo okay mines either pandas yeah or
giraffes or horses or dogs I have a fear
of sharks but I do like Shark Week
they're very treatment time she won't
even go swimming in the lake because I
said meanwhile struck me comes on and
she's like the most pumped out of anyone
who knows okay sixteen if your house is
burning down and your entire family was
sure to be okay what would you save and
why my fridge they're definitely rich I
would make sure I make good with a um I
feel like if family includes Bentley
either my camera and computer actually I
probably got my slippers because I
haven't obsession with this because I
would grab my slippers on my Keurig just
so even if Isaac if it'd be any benefit
even if I didn't have a house anymore
and I delay just in a plot of land I
would have my slippers on and I would be
with my coffee and I wouldn't care the
comedy horror or chick-flick comedy like
lol good choice rom-com or horror
because I'm I want to watch a scary
movie I love them in the sense of I I
find scary movies funny like when I
watch a scary movie I actually laugh at
it like I'm bursting out laughing I'm
like why are you going in the Attic
okay number 18 black bear iPhone iPhone
okay
19 favorite movie Finding Nemo Princess
Bride what the heck is Princess Bride oh
my god you haven't seen it I feel like
my favorite movies are anything with
mary-kate and Ashley Olsen okay that's
true Parent Trap it's like all the
Disney movies or bridesmaids and the
Grinch like I know - huh - like Jim
Carrey yes the Grinch
20 what is something weird that you eat
Ricky a lot of weird stuff my name's
like I think the weirdest things that we
both do is like we're both really
obsessed mustard yes and like mustard
goes on everything like we'll eat a
piece of those with mustard on and we
make we've made toast with mustard and
onions before we put mustard on our rice
dishes like I'm like why would you put
soy sauce on it when you could put
mustard on it especially deep fried
pickles little bit mustard pivoted
mustard like we love mustard so that's
probably one of the weirdest things we
put mustard on everything that and we
also put peanut butter on everything
okay
21 do you guys have anything magic Oh
when we were in grade 6 was it we used
to go to stores and buy like matching
shirts but we'd get them in different
colors thinking that that was okay
matching Ninja Turtle shirts or the
other them with a movie so that Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle okay and then 22

then I have like my other really random
favorite TV shows like cops

your favorite thing to do together and I
feel like there's so many instances like
we could make this a full day we would
wake up its Starbucks I know how typical
yeah um a couple hours later go get
sushi patinas and then other than that
our other favorite things to do together
is literally bench like we become couch
potatoes and watch stupid stuff and take
naps and Facebook creepy pool not even
Facebook creepy kind of just like social
media creep in the sense that we go
creep like blogs and stuff yeah that's
pretty much it like we get any road

then shopping and shopping that's pretty
standard but that's like it we don't do
anything crazy okay guys so those were
