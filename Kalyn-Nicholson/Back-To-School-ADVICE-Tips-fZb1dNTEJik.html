guys what's up and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm going to
doing another talking talk with you guys
and as requested this one's going to be
an updated at back-to-school advice
slash yeah because I catered my original
back-to-school advice videos towards
high school students I'm going to kind
of cater this one more towards going to
college or university but it's easily
adaptable to high school too so whether
you're going back to high school college
universities work whatever you're doing
I got the advice for you so without
further ado if you guys want to know my
advice when it comes to going back to
school then just keep watching tip
number one when it comes to going back
to school the one that I honestly wish
the exact could go back and change
anything I would go back and actually
appreciate this and do it more and it's
actually doing the school work and I
know that that sounds like so dreadful
like sounds like such a snooze who
actually wants to put in the effort to
do the school work mind you I only did
one semester of college but looking back
on it I mean you have to put in a lot
more effort to actually do the school
work as opposed to high school I'm not
saying that you don't have to put as
much effort in in high school but when
you go to college or university you're
going to have to actually be ready to do
the school work so if you're also
watching this you're in high school it's
been a just they're getting into heaven
now like if I could go back in time I
would have totally put way more effort
and kind of driven myself it's a little
bit more towards the schoolwork and
being able to learn and get an education
which so many people in this earth
aren't even able to do you're going to
build so much less stress that we keep
on top of your stuff on top of your work
don't procrastinate and keep things to
last minute if you guys want me to do
like a school habits video that I can
totally do that to you like get an
agenda keep on top of your schoolwork
it'll keep you so much less stress and
especially for things like college where
there art teachers necessarily writing
you to get your stuff in it's up to you
so if you don't do it and you
procrastinate everything to the last
minute
odds are especially if it's here for
year of university or college you might
not be able to pass and it might be
important to to figure out what kind of
learner you are like three it correct me
if I'm wrong types of learners visual
auditory and kinesthetic or kind of an
aesthetic wow I cannot get over today
which basically means either if you
learn by hearing things you learn by
seeing things or you learn by doing
things with your hands like being a bit
more hands-on for me I am definitely a
visual learner and a hands-on learner if
I can do something physically with my
hands I'll understand it better and if I
can't do it physically with my hands I
need to see it happening I need to see
it explained to me I am so not an audio
learner at all I would I would never be
able to be one of those people that
didn't take notes I would have to take
notes I would have to see diagrams I
would have to see examples so knowing
about yourself is going to help you get
through school work done and it'll help
you work around like your difficulties
when it comes to staying on top of
schooling not to mention it will also
help you establish maybe a better way to
take notes a better way to study all of
that fun stuff which lands me in to tip
number two and that is to stay organized
even though we already kind of touched
on this when you go away to school or if
you're still in high school
you have to stay organized not only with
your schoolwork but stay organized at
home too because if you lose papers you
lose agendas if you would look you're
gonna it's going to drive you nuts like
if you're just making a habit now to
keep your bedroom or your dorm or
whatever it is completely clean keep it
organized know where everything is and
keep your bags and your backpacks like
all of that stuff if you keep it
organized and clean I'm not kidding you
one it'll save you so much time to - it
also sees a peace of mind like I know
for me when my bedroom where my
apartment is a mess it's really hard for
me to concentrate in focus when I have
everything cleaned and clear and there's
no clutter it becomes a lot easier for
me to concentrate and get things done
and know where things are also using
things to help with your time management
now for me another huge tip that I have
for this is using it like time blocks so
when I know I need to do something that
I really don't want to like studying or
writing or working on something that I
just don't really feel like doing it all
I like to use time blocks
I'll just throw my phone like on timer
and I'll time lock out okay so for 45
minutes I'm going to go straight
Hardcore focusing on this
when the timer beats after 45 minutes
I'm going to give myself 15 minutes to
walk around dance around go on my phone
read a book watch some TV whatever is
grab a snack because that makes it
easier knowing that okay I'm not sitting
down mindlessly being like god I could
be here for hours it's like no I know
after 45 minutes I'm going to stop I'm
going to go and do something and then
after that 15 minutes is up I'm going to
come back and I'm going to start working
again I'm not kidding you this will
change your life this will make me the
most productive person on the planet it
helps knowing that okay I only need to
focus for 45 minutes and then I'm going
to get a break it's kind of like
shrinking down the time that we're
expecting our brains to just be so 100%
in you need to give yourself a break and
you need to know it's kind of a brain
trick you need to know that it's only 45
minutes so I can get there which I also
talked about in my ebook skills if you
guys haven't purchased it already I
released it last week but I did a game
changer that's all about time management
and this is like the number one thing
that honestly changed my life not to
mention if you're going to a college or
university it is really important to
budget yourself to this can also be used
in high school if you guys are working
part-time and you want to start
budgeting in things for the future but
especially if you're going away to
college in university if you get like
loans given to you like school loans or
student loans or if it's like the fact
that you're just going to start
crunching numbers and working part-time
jobs to keep yourself you know full and
and not hungry
information that you can still
participate in events and do things with
your friends so the school year create a
budget make sure you establish this
budget before you go away to school so
that you are already on top of it like
how much you going to spend on groceries
how much do you have to spend on going
to like homecoming how much do you have
to spend to going to that party or
whatever is like how much do you have to
pay for rent if you have to pay for rent
establish how much money you are allowed
to spend come up with a budget keep
yourself on top of it so that you don't
have to drop out of school because
you're broke when it comes to getting
organized just start now have a system
for everything and get on top of it so
that when you go into the school year
you're ready you're organized and you're
gonna crush it okay number three is to
not lose yourself and this goes for high
school students and college and
university students because we all know
that when we get around
new atmosphere or we go back to school
we're surrounded by so many other people
and it comes with this pressure of
wanting to be accepted and wanting to be
liked and I feel like sometimes that can
get in the way of who we actually are as
people and we start to do things
thinking that it's going to help us fit
in but as well sound to it when you get
out of high school when you get out of
college when life like comes and hits
you in the face and you're suddenly an
adult you're going to want to like
yourself you're not going to care if
anybody else likes you because if you
get out of school after all is said and
done and you have no idea who you are
or you don't like yourself it's going to
take so much time to rewire and unravel
like that kind of damage that you've
done to who you are and your character
and your self-esteem and your
self-acceptance so if you're going away
to college if you're going away to high
school wherever you're going if you're
going to work even make sure that at the
end of the day the things you do the
things you say the actions you take and
the person you are is someone that you
accept and that you like and make that a
higher priority than anyone else
accepting you or liking you if you do
what happen to lose yourself know that
it's okay sometimes we do have to lose
ourselves to find ourselves again I
truly do believe that and I think of so
many times or I could consider it having
lost myself here at high school and even
after high school and honestly when I
look back on it now I don't necessarily
consider it a bad thing because I look
at it as a way that I grew and and
learned and so much of Who I am today
came from those phases of feeling like I
wasn't myself or I had lost myself so
try to stay true to who you are but if
you can't don't beat yourself up for it
because a lot of us go through phases
where we feel like we lose ourselves and
odds are when you're losing yourself in
a lot of ways you're actually just
finding yourself that was super deep
except number four is to put yourself
out there and this is another tip that
if I could go back in time I would have
totally done differently because I think
I let my social anxiety kind of take
over and stop me from putting myself out
there more thank God in high school I
had put myself out there not to do
cheerleading because I honestly think
cheerleading did change my life in a lot
of ways but when I think about college
or when I think about all the other
things that I know I wanted to do with
high school like I wanted to try out for
the plays and I wanted to join more
teams but I didn't put my
out there because I was afraid of
rejection and I was afraid failure even
reaching out with two different friends
but I remember being too afraid to ever
like talk to people that weren't
actually in my friend group and it's
just one of those things that when you
look back on it in the future you're
like wow that was super dumb of me like
I should have just been more you know
vibrant and more open and if people
reject you and you fail who freakin
cares like the only person that gets to
decide whether or not it's a big deal is
you so when you put yourself out there
when you join clubs when you try out for
teams when you reach out to you know the
stranger sitting beside you in your new
freshman class or you make friends with
the girl down the hall in your dorm not
only are you branching out to make your
year better you're branching up to make
the rest of your life better because
these are some of the people you're
going to know for the rest of your life
these are some of the memories you're
going to have for the rest of your life
and also it forces you to kind of be
confident in it in a place where you're
unsure in your unknown and that is some
of the best character developing that
you can do my friend put yourself out
there say hi to people join clubs try
out for things because the worst that
can happen is you fail and it's really
not that I going to do
coffee's getting cold and then tip
number five my last and final one is to
make it both academic goals and this
again can be fun right now the goals
that you have for this school year
whether you are in college and
university or you are in high school it
can be the grades you want to get the
teams you want to try out for the
friends you want to make the events you
want to throw because hey we can throw
the events in the party to create a goal
for this year or multiple goal to this
year and then also create your long-term
goals and these don't have to be set in
stone maybe you don't know what you want
to be doing five years from now but it
never hurts to kind of have a rough idea
of where you'd like to be or you
wouldn't mind being five years from now
because then you can align your this
year goals with that year goals
does that make sense making it the
eighth year exams or a child for
something like a play or you know join a
new sports team or start a new club and
doing it before the school year even
starts can make you prepared it'll make
you go you're a need for those goals
it'll get you kind of in the mindset to
get ready to crush them and then I go to
the school year if you keep organized
and you use an agenda planning on your
academic goals
seeing those goals being met it's such a
good and satisfying feeling
also teaching you to do that for the
rest of your life and give you a sense
of accomplishment and confidence it's
going to make you go even further than
you ever thought you possibly could it's
honestly like a little pat on the back
for yourself and it's also a means of
pushing yourself and seeing how far you
can go and how much you can accomplish
because literally any limitations that
you have on yourself are all in your
mind you can do whatever you set out to
do you can be wherever you set out to be
you just have to believe it and then
push yourself to just do it
