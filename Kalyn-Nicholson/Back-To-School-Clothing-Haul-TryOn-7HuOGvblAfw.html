back to school hall series that I'm
doing just to back to school halls I
believe the first one down below it was
a makeup slash beauty Hall for
back-to-school so if you haven't seen
that one yet I will link it in the down
bar below so you guys can go check it
out but this is part two which is
fashion slash clothing stuff slash
accessories for back-to-school and this
is kind of like back-to-school slash
fall since obviously back-to-school
comes very close to the fall season so I
have been doing some fall shopping as
well so I'm going to be showing you guys
just a bunch of stuff that I have picked
up and you guys can let me know down
below which was your favorite and some
things that you guys have been picking
up for back-to-school slash bottle - be
sure to leave all those things down
below and I will be sure to check them
out I'm going to jump right in since I
do have quite a few things to show you
I'm going to do my best to try on as
many things as possible to show you guys
what they look like on so when that
happens a little box will just appear
somewhere on the screen showing you what
it looks like on so that is that and
let's jump in so I'm going to start off
with urban pool in it and I have my bag
right here and the first thing actually
that I'm going to show you from our
planet I'm wearing it right now it's
this black tank top it's basically just
a basic black chiffon material I'll
stand up and show you guys it's just
like this chiffon got my my pajama pant
actually these aren't even my pajama
pants I'm wearing ryan's pajama pants
this is chiffon material and it's black
and then it basically just has these
gold detailing chains in the bottom and
then in the back it's got three little
stripes so I just needed like a basic
black tank top to throw on for filming
and just something nice to wear when I
wanted to wear something half decent but
I don't really have very many black tank
tops oddly enough because I thought it
did but it didn't so I picked this one
up and I believe this one was $12 so
nice and cheap if I can find the stuff
I'll try and link it down below for you
guys continuing on into the things that
I got from urban Planet
you guys may have seen on Instagram
because I recently posted an Instagram
picture wearing this and it is this New
York chop it's like a muscle team so
basically it's just black it's kind of
cropped at the bottom and it kind of
looks like the Jack Daniels logo on the
front which is basically why I initially
bought it but it actually says in New
York and it's got the Statue of Liberty
and then it's got the cuts the arms cut
off so it's like a muscle tee and this I
believe I got this one for $12 or $10 as
well so nice and cheap the next thing
that I got is this sweater here and I
needed like a beige knit for
back-to-school and I thought it would
look really cute over this burgundy
skirt that I have so this is what it
looks like it's just like a nice knitted
sweater and yeah it's pretty basic it's
like cable knit or whatever I don't
really know how to explain this I don't
know it's a knitted sweater let's just
stick with that and it's this really
pretty beige color and this one I got
for 18 dollars and it's pretty basic but
I just feel like it's a good must-have
for fall and back-to-school
so next so many of you guys are asking
where I got this shirt because I wear it
an Instagram photo and in a fitness
Friday photo and it is this plaid woman
shirt or whatever you guys want to call
it like the collared shirts it's um
long-sleeve or whatever and buttons down
the front and the buttons are just
buttons when I got home I was kind of
bummed out that I couldn't get a small
but when I tried it on at home the fact
that it was a medium it kind of fit
baggy ER and I actually really liked it
that way so I'm kind of glad so if you
guys are looking for like the kind of
bag ear plod style go up a size because
it is worth it and it looks really cool
and cozy and this if you guys are gonna
go ahead and purchase this one I'll try
and find the link down below this is so
soft I can't even explain to you guys
when I picked it up I was like whoa
because I was expecting to kind of feel
just like normal plaid material but this
one is really really soft so before I
get into the accessories that I
purchased I needed a pair of just normal
sweatpants I feel like I have so many
pairs of sweatpants but so many of them
are either boys sweatpants like Ryan's
sweatpants or I've purchased boys
sweatpants before
comfortable or they have paint all over
them or they have like craft glue all
over them
they're just destroyed so I just needed
to look a decent pair to wear to and
from the gym and just around the house
when I wanted to look when I want to
wear sweatpants but don't want to wear
destroyed or way or is s up it so I
picked up this color and I don't have
any sub pants in this color either and
these are the boyfriend fit in a size
small and you can roll the tops and then
the white strings hang out obviously
which is what I usually do I usually
roll it so it's like this but it's
pretty basic and then they have the
cinching at the bottom as well of the
leg and they have a pocket on the bottom
so yeah that's basically what these are
so I'm going to move into the
accessories that I picked up for ribbon
planet and for starters I got this scarf
for six dollars and it's an affinity
star I ripped the tags off and I got
this in the color burgundy now I already
have a burgundy scarf from last year but
it is one of those like bouncy ones
where it's got all the ripples and it's
like really stretchy so I just wanted
like a normal infinity scarf that
doesn't have all the ruffles all over it
so I picked up this one for six dollars
which is a pretty good steal and this
hat that I recently got was five dollars
on urban planet and it is just a black
normal to quit like the ridging in it or
whatever and I was wearing this in a
recent picture on Instagram as well and
then last but not least I got this for
four dollars and it's just a black
headband with the tie at the top so and
it's got like the wiring inside so it
bends and shapes too however you morph
it and this was only four dollars and I
just thought it would be really cute for
back-to-school and black is a nice pop
of color in my blonde hair which you
can't see right now but I really wanted
a one of these headbands and it was only
four dollars so I couldn't go wrong and
then last but not least the last thing I
have to show you guys from urban planet
I picked up a pair of flats for $15 and
they are just plain old fake leather
moccasin flats and these were only 15 I
got them in the beige color and they've
got like the tie offs and such and yeah
that's pretty much it they're really
really cute and I'm definitely gonna be
wearing these a lot this back-to-school
slash fall season
I'm going to show you a dress that I got
this is for like end of summer slash
beginning of school like kind of
celebrations and going either to parties
or downtown or any special events
towards the end of this summer so this
is a just from shop hope and this one
was a little bit more expensive but it
was totally worth it because I'm
obsessed with it so this dress here it
was fifty dollars from shop hope and
this is what it looks like it's white
and it goes around your neck like a
halter and then it's got this like
bandage detailing going back and forth
over your chest occult area and then it
hooks into the back like kind of like a
bra which is that really cool and then
the rest of it is just like a normal
skirt it's really hard to show you guys
this on camera but I'm definitely gonna
try this one on so I can show you guys
its anyways it's just adorable so I'm
definitely be reppin this at a lot of
end of summer events or any parties or
celebrations for back-to-school slash
going out downtown the rest of my haul
is all from the store black 5 so the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is the bag that I got and I thought this
is so cute for the fall season
I got it in like a burnt orange it's
this really really pretty purse and this
is what it looks like so it's just
perfect size I don't really like huge
huge purses but I definitely carry a lot
around with me so I needed like a good
medium sized purse so this is the one
that I got in this burnt orange color I
just find it so pretty it's got just two
little shops and then on got all my
clothes stuffed in the inside so I can
show you guys so the first thing I'm
going to show you is this really pretty
cream blush colored top so it's like a
chiffon material again and it's got this
really pretty detailing in the front and
my favorite part about it is it scoops
low in the back as comparison to the
front which is perfect for wearing this
with leggings and such I thought it was
a really really pretty color next I got
these this pair of shorts which are
gonna be really cute for the transition
from summer to kind of cold or fall so
it's these really pretty white shorts
and they've got the it
Judis floral detailing all on the bottom
it's like a crocheted detailing and
there are a decent like longer than you
would think or you could read them
highway so to make them shorter but
perfect transition piece and there's so
many ways you could style there so next
I got this really pretty shirt probably
one of my favorite pieces that I picked
up from black 5 and it is this one here
so it's got like a nice crocheted
button-up detailing in the front and
then it's just like a clear chiffon in
the back and you know obviously wear
like a bandeau or a bra underneath this
or even a tank top or t-shirt underneath
this I just think it's so pretty and
really really cute and you could
definitely style this for end of summer
as well as back-to-school as well as for
the fall season so next I got this
really really cute romper it's this
really pretty like raspberry pink color
and it's got just like a scoop detailing
in the front and zipper down the back
and then it cinches around the waist and
then you'll see here that the shorts
have this really pretty pom-pom
detailing all around the rim of them
they are so cute and I can't wait to
style this romper as well so next I just
got this white shirt and you guys know
from previous videos probably that I've
been loving the cage detailing on
clothing so this one has got this really
pretty white page detailing along the
top and then it's a nice chiffon white
and it just kind of goes down and I just
love the look of cage detailing on
shoulders I don't know why it's an
obsession I don't know why I'm still
wearing this scarf but anyway so this is
the white shirt that I also got and then
last but not least I picked up this
necklace and it is a really pretty bib
necklace that you could wear it's got
dark blue detailing on it I just think
it's really really gorgeous in fact
maybe I'll put it on right now but this
is basically what it looks like I don't
have any bib necklaces in this color so
I decided to pick this one up but you
see I had two more items to show you
guys so bear with me the first one is
from Paxson I went and picked up this
really pretty a burgundy skirt it's
coming up warm red burgundy on camera
but it's actually like a purple burgundy
and it's this really pretty just basic
skater skirt I feel like there's so many
ways I'm
to style this and you'll probably see
this one on the blog too and then last
but not least is a pair of heels slash
wedges that I want to show you guys are
so adorable I picked these up from Lola
Shoetique so there's really nice snake
singing design wedges that I got from
Lola Shoetique they are absolutely
adorable and they have this bow
detailing and again if you can picture
this with any of the stuff that I
already have purchased these are going
to look so cute this in this fall season
so I picked these up from Lola Shoetique
