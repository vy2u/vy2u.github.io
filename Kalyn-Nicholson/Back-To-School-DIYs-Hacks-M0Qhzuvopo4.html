excited and also just like more
organized and prepared for the new
school year these hacks tips and DIYs

Twitter in my Instagram right here on
the screen so be sure to go check that
out and follow me as well as if you guys
want me to do like a college advice
videos and just a thumbs this video up
and I can totally do that for you guys
I've done a high school one before I did
it last year so if you haven't seen it I
will link it down below as well as
somewhere up on the screen here so that
you guys can go check that out it's all
about advice with going to high school
but it also kind of applies to just in
life in general so if you guys want me
to do a part two where I do college /
University then definitely just let me
know and I can totally film at so if you
guys want to get organized and see some
DIYs tips and hacks for back-to-school
then just keep watching
ah so I wanted to make the DIYs easy for
you guys to do at home all you're going
to need is a printer for this and I also
really enjoy kind of like minimalistic
type things so all I did was print out
this little city like skyline from
Google I will link it down below if I
can find it and then I just typed out my
name on PicMonkey in a really pretty
font and then just put that into a
binder I know that it's such an easy DIY
to do but it's just so simple and it
looks so nice with all of like your
notebooks and such
and speaking of notebooks I went and
picked up a few of these five star
notebooks from Walmart and then again I
just printed off a bunch of different
designs just to give you guys some
really cool and easy ideas that you can
do right from home and all you need is a
printer so the first one I did is I saw
a notebook online that said killing it
just like this so it's super easy to
just recreate that on your own and then
I'm using some mint glue to mount all of
the paper because one it will keep it in
place in two if you get any on the
notebook itself it rubs off really
really easily
another design idea is to go ahead and
print off a bunch of your favorite
cities like the skyline of them and then
mount that to your all of your notebooks
or your binders and then print off in
your favorite font all of the subjects
that you have for whichever semester so
this is another just super easy way to
keep your books organized but also have
them kind of personalize
like bars yoga No
and I was also a big sucker for putting
really inspirational photos on my
notebooks and stuff and if you guys
watched my coddle of your dream life you
could also do this as like a mini dream
board on your schoolbooks so just go
ahead and print out some of your
favorite photos mine are all from We
Heart It and I just put a Polaroid frame
on them on clunky and then printed those
out and then for the first notebook I
just grabbed a black one and then I'm
going to put them on like a Instagram
grid kind of and then take em my name
and a really pretty font and put that on
the bottom just to have this
personalized and even if you guys aren't
in school this is a really really cool
idea for like a journal or anything like
that
I can't get the taste out cuz your lips
taste like burn and another really easy
way to do this too is to just take the
pictures and put them on it just like
such having it's just really simple and
in the middle if you don't want anything
too crazy on your notebooks so those are
all little easy really simple DIYs that
you can do for your notebooks or your
binders or anything like that agendas
journals and as for the next DIY this is
definitely something that's super easy
to do for you at home and keep it on
your desk or if you live in a dorm so
all I'm doing is taking this little
picture frame that I got from Walmart I
initially was going to put two Eiffel
Towers but I mean to Empire State
Building sorry but I actually really
liked the Eiffel Tower that came
originally in the frames no this was
from Walmart you don't have to use like
a book type frame you could just use to
solo picture frames and then all you
need is a dry erase marker and you can
write your traduce for that week what
assignments you have some inspirational
quotes to keep you going through the
school week and all of that fun stuff
another really simple and affordable DIY
but it helps to keep you organized for
school and what is the school and fall
season without a new comfy like crewneck
sweater so I just figured this would be
a really fun DIY to do in this video if
you want to have like a really comfy
sweatshirt for your dorm or just for
studying so all you're going to need is
a sweater I got this from Walmart it's
actually from the men's section and then
I just got these iron-on letters
obviously you can choose whatever words
you want in terms of ironing on but I
saw this sweater idea actually on tumblr
or was it we heard it I don't remember
which one but then I figured why like go
out and buy one of those when it's so
easy to make one and then it's just
super comfy and you can wear it when you
study or around campus
and another tip I found really helpful
especially in college when I had a lot
of books is to get a tote so again I
picked up this tote bag from warmer and
it's one of the ones that you can add a
bunch of designs to and set yourself so
I went ahead and grabbed some felt
letters and I was going to either put an
NYC or coffee but I ended up going with
New York City but again you could put on
whatever words that you want to do and
then just go ahead and iron them on and
then you have a cute little tote bag
that um plug around all of your massive
books that don't fit in your backpack
and don't break your back hearing so now
moving on to the hacks the first one I
have to show you guys is that this
little FML bag so all I did was pick up
a really small compact make a bag from
Walmart but you can use one that you
already have at home and basically you
just want to put in everything in here
that you might need in an emergency so
like dry shampoo Tylenol deodorant like
wet wipes like anything that you might
need some perfume thanks for your hair
some gum and just keep this in your bag
at all time so you're always stopped no
matter what the emergency is it's such
an easy hack to do and always having
this in your bag you can either help out
yourself or always help out a friend in
need so that the school day or the work
day this is also really beneficial for
work as well so my next hack is really
good to help prioritize things you need
to do I learned to do this little grid
where you split a piece of paper in to
four and then you're going to want to
put urgent but not important important
but not urgent urgent and important and
then not urgent not important and then
then that is a really easy way to
prioritize all of the things that you
feel like you need to do this is really
helpful especially if you don't have an
agenda and then just do the ones that
are the most important first and
basically yeah prioritize that way other
things you can do is get apps like
forests that help you concentrate
without using your phone if you need to
be studying and another really big tip
to is to put assignments or anything
that's due in your phone and sync it up
to your laptop in your MacBook so that
way you always have your calendar on
hand and you're always keeping on top of
all the dates that you need to remember
and assignments that you need to do and
of course my biggest tip is to make a
study playlist this is something I find
so helpful when I'm editing or working
on my book and for school too if you
have a go to playlist of just really
chill songs that you can study too it
keeps you in the zone especially if you
do it for like hour increments and then
just make sure you're studying for an
hour taking a break studying again and
my last and final hack is something I
actually used to do a lot in college and
every Sunday night I would meal prep a
massive meal and then I would have that
in containers for lunch for like two to
three days so if you can do this whether
you're in college or living at home not
only will this make it so much easier
for you to pack your lunch in the
mornings and save you so much time but
it also makes sure that you're eating
healthy throughout the school year so
yeah that was like the biggest hack that
I used in college and it was like a fave
of mine and that concludes all of the
DIYs and hacks for back-to-school that I
had to show you guys today
