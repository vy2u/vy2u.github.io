Mondays I'm feeling pretty lazy and not
wanting to put too much effort into my
hair so for this hairstyle you're going
to want to create a top knot but leave a
chunk of your hair out
go ahead twist it really fast around
itself and secure it into place
and then use that chunk to just create a
braid and wrap it around the fun super
easy and really quick to do and doesn't
take much effort for a Monday
so for Tuesday I wanted to do a really
cool twist on a normal braid so I'm
going to go ahead and just add a couple
curls into my natural hair and I'm just
using the Conair infinity wand and just
wrapping random pieces around it and
then what I'm going to do is go ahead
and take a section from the top of where
I have my hair parted and create a
little braid so then pull all the hair
off to one side and create a very loose
ponytail because what we're going to do
is reach in between it and pull it
through and wrap it around itself as you
guys can see me here saw me do and then
go ahead and just braid the rest of the
hair and secure it into place
you guys can go ahead and recore curl
some of these sections framing your face
and that is all there is for this hair
cell
yeah it's pretty good
I know well I can shake it shake it like
I'm supposed so now that it's Wednesday
a k-cup day we can put a little bit more
effort into our hair so what I'm going
to do is put some heat protecting spray
on my hair and go ahead and curl some
pieces on each side if you got beauty
beauty just raise them up every inch of
you is perfect from the bottom to the
top pop music one of one some simple
instructions and again I'm doing this in
random sections to make it look a little
bit more natural then what I'm going to
do to add some volume to my hair is
spray some dry shampoo up into the roots
and rub it in and then I'm going to go
ahead and pull all my hair up on the top
of my head and secure it into place into
a high ponytail pull out some of the
sections and kind of create a little bit
more volume up on the top bed so the
cords are 1 4 6 4 not too familiy your
hominy in thirds not boats would take
you into the
so this ponytail is super fun and cute
and really easy to do so moving on to
Thursday I decided to keep my hair down
this day so what I'm going to do is just
hurt my hair right down the middle and
pull it off onto each side I'm then
taking a section from each the top of
each side of my head and just twisting
it around itself this is really easy for
those of you guys that don't know how to
braid just go ahead and twist until you
get towards the bottom and secured into
place underneath some hair so that
nobody can see the bobby pin
he got me shades
so once you've done that on the other
side - then you are done this hairstyle
super easy and you can do this with
straight hair or curly hair change the
chains only way so now finally that it
is Friday we're going to do a fun
hairstyle that is really elegant but
still really easy to do so I'm doing is
just brushing up my hair and this part
is optional but I'm adding a piece of
extension just to make this super long
so I'm just creating a small ponytail
with only part of my hair around the
crown of my head and then after using my
extensions as a beard I'm going to go
ahead and secure that around the
ponytail and then pull up the rest of my
hair to cover the piece of extension
so once it's secure it into place go
ahead and brush out any tangles and then
create three different sections and then
make a normal braid right down to the
very bottom of the ponytail and secure
it into place I've been super in love
with this look of a high braid on your
head I just feel like it looks so pretty
and elegant but it's so easy to do
please save
so those are my five hairstyles for
every day of the week for back-to-school
I hope you guys enjoyed them and I'll
see you guys all in a future
back-to-school video bye but it ended</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
