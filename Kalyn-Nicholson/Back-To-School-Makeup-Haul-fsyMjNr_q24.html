missus okay your one ears a little
floppy today hey guys so for today's
video this is going to be part one of a
two-part series or video and it's pretty
much going to be hauls for
back-to-school so this one is going to
be like a beauty essential haul or
beauty related haul for back-to-school
and part two is going to be a clothing
haul for back-to-school and I have about
two or three other back to school videos
coming after that and then that will be
the end of my back-to-school kind of
section so if you guys are already back
to school no worries you guys can still
pick up these items they're kind of like
an all year round type of thing but I
have some fun trends that are going on
this fall that you guys can go pick up
and just some necessities for revamping
your style and your beauty for
back-to-school so I'm going to jump
right into the hall I got everything
from Walmart because I just find Walmart
has the absolute best prices you guys
know how much I love Walmart and also
most of you guys have a Walmart in your
area too so I kept there to see with me
to just say we got to give you guys an
idea I wanted to keep things nice and
affordable for you guys and get things
that a good price so you guys are able
to get them for yourself so I didn't get
anything too extensive and I even got
some less expensive items if you don't
want to splurge on the more expensive
ones so I'll be telling you guys all of
the prices since I got such a good deal
on everything so I'm going to start with
kind of face and hair and then move on
to the makeup since there is the mass
majority of this is make up some points
start with hair the first thing I picked
up or a new shampoo and conditioner it's
always good to be keeping your shampoo
and conditioners on rotation and trying
out new ones because your hair can
actually become accustom to the shampoo
and conditioner that you're using and I
figured with back-to-school you kind of
want to recharge your hair my hair gets
really dry and brittle in the summertime
from the humidity and just from how dry
it is outside so I decided to get the
Garnier Fructis hydra recharge and this
is for dry hair since I do have pretty
dry hair and I find a lot of people the
vast majority of people have dry hair so
this will work for all of you guys but
especially if you have dry hair and it's
just posed to recharge your hair and add
the moisture back in and literally guys
from Walmart these were 2 dollars and 98
cents each so six dollars for a whole
new haircare routine for my shower
so keeping on the topic of hair and this
is definitely an essential for me for
back-to-school it is the depth and
figure eating dry shampoo so this is my
absolute favorite dry shampoo I have
tried so many it's really good to have
in your locker or in your backpack and
you guys can get job travel portions of
this too if you don't feel like lugging
this big thing but this is amazing if
your hair starts to get oily or if you
have gym class sprayed into roots and
massage it in and it'll get rid of all
that oil and keep you good for the rest
of the day and so I paid four dollars
and 77 cents for this dry shampoo which
is a steal because this will last me
probably about a month or two moving on
to skin I know a lot of people say that
their skin clears up a lot in the summer
and I think that's from sun exposure
when the summer months come my skin gets
super super dry and I get really bad
blemishes and breakouts so I have
definitely been breaking out you guys
can't see because I have it all covered
up right now so I definitely wanted to
get rid of those especially for
back-to-school so I got two new products
for my face the first one is the sea
knives
naturally clear apricot cleansing
blemish fighting oil-free cleanser so
that's a really long title for this but
I've used this before and it really
helps clear out my skin especially for
my blemishes so this cleanser here was
for 97 so many more cleansers go from
like nine ten dollars to thirty forty
dollars so really can't beat five bucks
for this and then the next thing I got
was a new moisturizer which again is a
definite essential for back-to-school
you really want to start moisturizing
your your face and your skin come the
fall season so I got the clean and clear
advantage acne control moisture it has
two silic acid in it so this is a really
really light moisturizer which I like
for everyday underneath my makeup it
doesn't feel too cakey or too thick and
it has Susilo acid in it which is going
to help fight my blemishes and my acne
for a lot of you if you're younger - you
don't want to be using something that's
really expensive or too excessive that
you don't need so
is definitely a go-to so this one was 8
dollars and 97 cents for this
moisturizer so now for the front part
we're going to be moving into all of the
makeup and I'm going to share with you
guys some of my definite essentials for
back-to-school and some really good
deals as well as some trends so moving
on to the first thing I got the
maybelline baby skin and this is an
instant pore eraser now I actually have
the benefit Porefessional and I decided
to try this out because it is so much
cheaper it's such a better deal and if
it's gonna do the exact same thing then
why waste all that money so next I got
the hard candy heavy duty concealer with
a concealer pencil and I do like to pick
up a lot of hard candy products from
Walmart because I do know that they are
definite cruelty free so I try to do my
best to buy as much cruelty free as
possible so I picked up the hard candy
glamoflauge and the reason why I got
this is because it is a heavy duty
concealer so especially would come back
to school if you guys are like me
staying up too late and used to your
summer nights and then waking up super
early to go for school in the morning
you're gonna want a heavy duty concealer
and this was five dollars and 98 cents
so next I'm going to go with my two
products from my mouth the first one I
got was through Rimmel London stay matte
long-lasting pressed powder and the
second one I got was the Rimmel London
natural bronzer and it's waterproof
bronzing powder I got these four to 410
at Walmart they were on a special so the
stain mat is this going to keep your
skin looking nice and matte all day and
it's long lasting so to last your entire
school day and this one here the Ramon
natural bronzer it's waterproof which I
guess you don't need too much for the
back-to-school but knowing that it's
waterproof means that it's also
long-lasting so it's gonna stay on your
skin all day so next I picked up another
hard candy product and it is a new blush
for back-to-school it is in the color
honeymoon and it was between this and I
believe the other one was bombshell and
I asked Ryan to pick one out I'm like
babe which color should I get for
back-to-school and for some reason he
chose honeymoon so I decided to go with
what he said so if you guys are
wondering or want a boy's opinion this
is the color Ryan picked out it's like a
pearlescent pink with a little bit of
purple like lining through it it's
really cool and I just thought it would
be a nice pop of color for
back-to-school and I
this for six dollars and 98 cents so
next I picked up a brand-new foundation
track to try out for back-to-school and
actually wearing it right now it is the
maybelline superstay foundation and i am
in the color where are you
true beige this was my go to last fall
season and it is because it is a nice
coverage without feeling too cakey and
it sets really well when you put your
powder on top of it definitely
long-lasting it says it's 24 hours but I
mean I wouldn't probably wear my
foundation for 24 hours I think this
makeup like probably six hours ago and
it is still perfectly on so definitely
pick up this foundation and this almost
only $11.98 it warmer so moving on to
lips the first thing I wanted to pick up
was a new deep plum lipstick and I got
two options here one's a little bit
cheaper than the other but both are
awesome and this is a really big trend
this fall and it was a big trend last
fall too but I'm seeing it a lot more
this year including in the summertime so
I picked up two new colors so this one
here is by NYC and it's in the color 328
maja guinea and this was a dollar and 97
cents so guys if you're looking for a
new deep plum lipstick you cannot go
wrong with this for two dollars it's
gonna last you a nice long time and it
is a nice a deep mahogany plum color the
maybelline in 435 and plum perfect and
this is what it looks like and this is
the one that's on my lips right now so
this one is probably a little bit more
wearable than the mahogany one it's not
as dark or as bold but it still gives
you that one perfect look and that is
the one I'm wearing right now in case
you are curious seven dollars and 96
cents for this one and then next you're
gonna want to set that with a lip gloss
so I decided to go with a new Revlon lip
gloss and this one is in the color so
this one's in the color embellished and
it is a really really deep plum purple
and it's actually got some shimmer in it
as well
so yeah it was over this lipgloss I mean
it goes over this lipstick perfectly and
this one was seven dollars and 97 cents
we're not big on both lips like this one
I definitely picked up a color or a
product for you guys that don't like to
do the both lips and it is the Burt's
Bees replenishing lip balm and
pomegranate this is definitely gonna
help your lips from getting chapped at
the school day back at school to air
some little stuffy so it's definitely
gonna keep you from getting chapped lips
so this one was four dollars and ninety
eight cents so next moving on to and
nails I have two nail polishes here for
you once cheaper than the others so the
first thing I'm going to show you is the
SC one so this one was eight dollars and
ninety seven cents at Walmart which is
such a steal for SC most of the time I
see it for $9.99 or more and this is in
the color Bahama Mama so it was hard for
me to pick up a nice plum color for this
back-to-school slash fall season so
again I had like three of them and I was
like babe what color do I pick it was
like this one and then I had a really
deep red color and then I had a blue
color much like this one and Ryan Pitz
Ohama mama and I don't know if it was
just because he likes to save Bahama
Mama or if you actually like the color
but it was definitely a good find
I have it on my nails right now and I
definitely really really liked it it
came out a lot better than I thought it
was going to because I wasn't initially
gonna pick this one so this is Bahama
Mama by SC and the second color which
I've been seeing everywhere - I decided
to get it in a cheaper version so this
one here I believe was 397 actually it's
296 so I got this for three dollars and
this one is the Maybelline Color show in
the color blue bombshell so it's
definitely not so much about might be
showing up more blue on camera but it's
definitely got some purple undertones in
it it's kind of like a periwinkle purple
or purpley blue it's really hard to
explain but I've been loving this color
so that's bear with me I only have four
more products to show you guys and
they're all pertaining to eyes so I will
start out with eyeshadows so definitely
for back-to-school I like to keep it
nice and neutral at school you don't
want to go too heavy on the colors on
your eyes and stuff so I picked up a
nice fresh new palette it's the Revlon
Colorstay in 520 Rosanna or
or I don't even know how to say that so
I apologize by this budget it but it's a
nice neutral pilot with pretty neutral
colors and I decided to go with neutral
too since every color of I can wear a
nice neutral bronzes so I love these
looks for back to school for those of
you that don't like to put a lot of
color on your eyes and like to keep your
eyes nice and simple just a singular
eyeshadow from hard candy and this one
is in the color infatuation so it's a
really nice like nude champagne color
with a tiny bit of shimmer to it and
this will look really nice on all eye
colors and nice and simple for
back-to-school and I believe this one
was almost 2 dollars and 98 cents those
three dollars for a pretty eyeshadow and
even if you guys do like to wear a lot
of color in your eyes you should pick
this one up too cuz this would make a
really nice color for your inner
tear-duct and highlight and then my last
two items are my go-to eyeliner and my
go-to mascara a lot of you guys been
asking lately what mascara is I'm
wearing on my eyes or what eyeliner and
I'm wearing so these are my go-to all
year round and so I especially had to
pick up two brand new ones for
back-to-school the first one the
eyeliner I always wear my absolute go to
is my L'Oreal linear intense it's a felt
tip liquid eyeliner in carbon black
wearing it now pretty much wearing it in
absolutely any video I'm ever wearing
eyeliner this is my go-to
I love it because it's super controlled
really nice tip and it's going to give
you a really bold look for
back-to-school so this is my absolute
essential for back-to-school or just
essential in general this is my
essential eyeliner so the linear intense
is 7 dollars and 67 cents and next it is
my go to back-to-school mascara so this
is the Maybelline falsies volume Express
in blackest black so you can layer this
nice and bold and make it really both
lashes your back to school or you can
put like a layer 2 and make a nice
natural look or back to school but I
love this mascara and it was only five
dollars and 94 cents okay
six dollars at Walmart so a super steal
and one of my go-to month's carrots so
that is my entire beauty haul and
essential and trends and just fun stuff
I'm loving for back-to-school I
hope you guys enjoyed this again don't
