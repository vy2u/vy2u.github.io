to be sharing with you guys just how to
do a messy bun or the messy bun that I
was doing in my outfit videos as well as
just some fall makeup and two outfits
for school so starting off usually for
my messy bun what I like to do is just
brush out the hair that's going to be
pulled up but I try not to brush it past
where it's on my scalp if that makes any
sense because I like the end of the hair
to be textured for the bun and then I
just come up combine everything at the
top of my head and take an elastic the
same color as my hair and I'll use my
fingers to just kind of comb back any
bumps or anything that's kind of
sticking out and then I make sure to
hold it a little bit looser on my head
and make sure that it's like not super
tight or um you guys can pretty much see
here anyway and then I take my elastic
and I flipped around twice and pull the
hair through the second time and yeah I
just kind of play around with it from
there and pull on it to tighten it and
pull some hair out and just kind of play
around with it until I get it the way I
want it to look
I can't take it
so the whole reason why I brush at the
top is just to make sure that it kind of
goes back more smoothly and then the top
of it kind of stays textured and kind of
makes a little bit more of a textured
bun I guess so that is what this one
looks like but I also do another type of
messy bun so for this one what I like to
do is again I'll have my hair already
just brushed out from the hair that goes
up on the scalp and I'll leave the rest
kind of textured again and then I take
it all on the top of my head and just
twist it as quickly as possible around
itself and then throw an elastic on it
and again then from there I'll just kind
of play around with it and just push
back any bumps or anything and just pull
on the bun until I kind of get it loose
and messy while still being tight for
this one to tighten it you just want to
pull it in from the middle of the bun
and tighten it just with like two
fingers just from the very center of it
and then just play around with the hair
until again you get it how you want it
so those are the two messy buns that I
like to do and they're just super easy
for school really quick and they require
no heat and yeah you can do it with
second day hair or clean hair they're
just super easy so it was so highly
requested that I did the makeup from
this picture from Instagram so I decided
to throw that in here so I'm just going
in with my two-faced foundation and I'll
leave links to all of the makeup
products down below and anything that
isn't cruelty free I'm going to leave a
cruelty free link instead because I'm in
the process of moving all my makeup over
to being cruelty free so yeah I don't
know I'm sorry if that's not what you
guys want to see but it just it feels
more right for me to kind of leave more
cruelty free things in the downbar since
that's kind of the transition I'm making
in my own life so yeah but you guys can
use whatever you have to so don't feel
the need to like buy it all anyway I'm
rambling so yeah I'm just going in with
concealer and highlighting and then
blending it in with a stippling brush
and then I'm gonna go in and do my brows
and if you guys have any vegan or just
cruelty-free brow products let me know
down below because I'm looking for a new
one
and then after that I like to set
everything in place with just a
translucent pressed powder and since
this is like a deep fall-like lip look I
like to make it as matte as possible so
I do a lot of dabbing with the powder
and that's just my own personal
preference but I like to make my face
look as mattified as humanly possible so
then on a big fluffy brush I'm just
taking some of my bronzer actually by
Too Faced and it's just the chocolate
Soleil and I'm blending this into the
crease as my starting base color and I
just find this is just a really easy
color to start out with and it's really
accessible and you can use it as your
bronzer too of course so I'm just
blending that into my crease and then
I'm just taking a matte darker brown
color and just putting that more so in
the outer corner and then blending it in
as well
and then I'm just taking that same brown
color and I'm blending it underneath my
lower lash line to make a more dramatic
effect especially since I'm not going to
be using eyeliner and then I'm just kind
of taking a matte skin toned eyeshadow
and using that as the base of my eye and
then taking a little bit of a champagne
color and putting it in the inner
tear-duct and then the same mattified
skin color tone that I'm using I guess
I'm really bad at explaining this guy's
I apologize but I'm using that under my
brow bone to as a highlight so then I'm
just going to curl my lashes and I'm
going to go in with a few coats of
mascara my favorite all-time mascara
lately has been my Too Faced better than
sex mascara
it's my Holy Grail and I just do like
three or four five maybe coats of this
it depends on how crazy I'm feeling that
day but I don't wear fake lashes anymore
because of this mascara so you guys know
how much I was wearing fake lashes at
one point so this thing is pretty much
my life so then with a cranberry colored
lip liner I'm just outlining my lips and
filling them in and then I'm going in
with just a smoked purple lipstick this
one's actually from Mac but I will try
and find a cruelty-free
alternative and leave it down below
know as we get down
and then I just did one more quick coat
of mascara before going in and doing the
last trick on my lips so the trick that
I've always had to do I don't know if
this is like a terrible thing to do
makeup wise like I am not by any means a
makeup professional but I just like to
take a really deep burgundy color
eyeshadow and I put this on a brush and
just kind of DAB it on top of the
lipstick it keeps it from you know like
smudging and going everywhere all day
like I can drink a glass of water and it
doesn't come off on the glass and I just
find it really deep into the color and
it makes it super matte too so that's
just something that I've always done
it's just been like my little trick when
I'm doing like a deep deep lip color so
I don't know if that's totally wrong
thing to do but I do it anyways and then
on a just a like concealer brush I'm
taking a little bit of concealer and
just outlining the bottom because I get
really crazy about having like crisp
lipstick lines so yeah I do that and
then I just blend it out and then take a
little bit of pressed powder and just
set it all into place
and then just going back in with that
chocolate Soleil by two-faced
I'm just contouring my cheekbones and my
hairline my jaw and my nose space
between you gotta kiss so full that your
body and of course what would be a dark
burgundy lip color without some burgundy
blush so I'm just popping a little bit
of that on my cheekbones and just
blending it upwards to make it look a
little bit more natural so that is it
for the makeup it's super easy to do and
it's been my go-to for the fall so I'm
probably going to be wearing this a lot
again this year so let's move on to the
outfits I will leave links to all of the
outfit details down below but these are
just two cute little outfits that you
could wear for back-to-school or even
just for the fall time that are really
easy and pretty affordable so those were
the two outfits that I pieced together
for back-to-school so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know if
you guys have any more fall video
requests down below and I will see you
guys all in a future upcoming video so
yeah bye guys
try not to fall on the way home you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
