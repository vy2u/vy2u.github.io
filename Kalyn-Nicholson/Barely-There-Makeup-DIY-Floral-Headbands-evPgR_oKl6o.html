showing you how to make these awesome
floral headband as well as a barely
there makeup tutorial which I think go
really well together for the springtime
and I'm gonna start by showing you guys
the makeup so if you want to wear makeup
that doesn't look like you're wearing
too much makeup on or any at all then I
would start with a tinted moisturizer to
even out your skin tone without making
it look like you're wearing a lot of
caked on makeup or foundation then going
in with a peach blush because pinks are
actually meant to look a little bit more
artificial and I'm using a cream blush
because powders also look a little bit
too fake and then just to set the
powders in place I'm going in with a
pressed powder but I'm only putting it
on my forehead and on the bridge of my
nose to keep my face luminescent because
it looks more natural that way
because I have a lot of sparse spots in
my eyebrows I'm just going to lightly
fill them in with a medium toned powder
doing this with a very very light hand
to not make them look too to find and
then I'm actually using the same medium
toned Brown and putting it on a blending
brush it's a matte color and it's going
to match my eyebrows so it's gonna look
a little bit more natural and just
putting this into the crease of my eye
to add some definition but because it
isn't shimmery or anything it doesn't
look too fake then no matter if you're
wearing a lot of makeup or a little bit
I always like to add a lot of drama to
my eye lashes I feel like you can't
really go above and beyond on this one
so I decided to go ahead and use my
telescopic just to add a lot of lot of
length and just a little bit of volume I
find the length looks better when you're
wearing a barely there makeup look and
then going in with a lipglo by dior and
the formula of this lipgloss / lip balm
is actually meant to adapt to your skin
tone and changed by different Pink's for
each person so it goes to your perfect
shade of pink
so that's it for the barely there makeup
so let's move on to how to make these
awesome DIY headbands that have been
definitely trending lately and I've been
seeing them everywhere so you're gonna
need some fake flowers you can pick any
kind of flowers you want in these
headbands that don't stretch you want
ones that are already nice and wide and
that could only stretch at the back
I found these studded ones at the dollar
store so I'm just removing the studs
from all of the headbands
and then taking these little daisies and
cutting the stems off of them to make it
so that you can glue it on easily and
then just taking a hot glue gun and I am
putting the Daisy right on for this
headband I decided to kind of overlap
the daisies to make it so you couldn't
see too much of the black
when it got
this is what the finishing result was
and this is probably my favorite from
all three that I decided to make so
moving on again I just removed the studs
from another black headband and for this
one I'm just putting these really pretty
yellow flowers and doing the exact same
routine that I just did with the other
headband
so I only put five flowers on this
headband and it turned out really pretty
and I also did the exact same thing but
with a pink and white flowers so this is
what the ending results of all of the
headbands looked like and I just totally
loved them and I think they go so well
with a barely their makeup tutorial it
just looks so natural with the flowers
and I just love this look for spring so
let me know which headband was your
favorite down below and if you decide to
try out this makeup look be sure to send
me a picture of me at Twitter or
Instagram so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys all in a future
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
