share with you guys my beauty and Beach
essentials so I guess we'll just get
started one of the main essentials that
I have when going to the beach is
definitely a tapestry if you guys follow
me on Instagram and Twitter you guys
know I've been obsessed with tapestries
lately so I have a bunch of different
ones and I'll always bring a different
one to the beach because they're nice
and big and easy to sit on and then for
those of you like me who just like to
keep a little bit of coverage even when
going to the beach I suggest using a BB
cream this is the Olay fresh effects BB
cream which gives me just a tiny bit of
coverage while also making my skin feel
really moisturize and good for the beach
and of course what is the beach without
sandcastles so I always like to bring a
little sandcastle kit from the dollar
store to
and as I'm sure you guys already know
it's super important to bring a hat to
keep you guys from getting too much Sun
at the beach I also like to wear really
bright nail polish to the beach I don't
normally paint my nails at the beach I
don't suggest this but lately I've been
loving my covergirl outlast nail
polishes in the magenta and the yellow
color so those are the colors that I
went for and a tip I actually learned in
Dominican was to put a little bit of
conditioner in the ends of my hair when
going to the beach so the dry divide the
conditioner by Pantene is my absolute
favorite it's the bomb and it keeps my
hair super moisturized and my ends
really really really healthy so that is
what I put in my hair at the beach and
of course it's important to bring lots
of food including fruits so I have an
obsession with grapes and I was trying
to catch them in my mouth but it's good
to bring some fruit or any type of food
to the beach as well and sorry for all
the dancing clips obviously the beach
puts me in a really good mood and for
when the day is done I like to put a dry
shampoo in my hair to get rid of all the
oil and grease from building up all day
and my favorite has been my Pantene dry
shampoo as I've already told you guys
and then at the end of the day it's
really important to put a moisturizer on
your skin to keep your skin from getting
dry from being in the Sun all day so
those are all of my tips and essentials
for the beach I hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
