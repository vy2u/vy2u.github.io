to be doing an early early spring haul
like really early I know it's still
February okay it's the winter aka I'm
living in Canada so it's really still
winter but I couldn't help but start
buying all of the kind of firsts and
upcoming spring things that I've been
seeing everywhere lately so I did some
shopping and most of these things are
for the spring and summer so I'm just
going to share them with you
I have fashion things to show you guys
and beauty things to show you guys also
we do have Bentley here with us today
he's just being very antisocial Billy
who's here what is your issue alright
guys so I'm going to jump right in
I'm gonna get the beauty stuff out of
the way first just because that's nice
and easy okay so for those of you that
don't know the targets in Canada are
closing so there's big liquidation sales
going on there right now so I went there
with my sister yesterday and I picked up
just a couple things that I'm going to
show you guys the first thing that I
picked up was this NYX stay matte but
not flat powder foundation I actually
thought this was more of a just like
setting powder but I'm not exactly sure
because it says powder foundation so I
will find out that find that out the
next thing I picked up from NYX was that
this NYX love in Paris part Parisian
chic Parisian chic I am sorry if I
pronounced that wrong but yeah so that
is the palette that I picked up from NYX
and this was originally 1199 and I got
it for 30% off and it just got some nice
warm like bronzes a little bit of
shimmer in there it's just got some good
basic color so next from NYX I actually
picked up a NYX pinky beige lip pencil
that is the color I got it in was pinky
beige so I got this Sun here and this
one was originally $5.99 and I got it
for 30% off again so all the makeup
pretty much everything from Target was
30% the next thing I got was this NYX
stick blush and I got it in the color
spo2
pink Lotus so the last thing I ended up
getting from the liquidation sale at
Target was just this brush here it's a
precision blush
precision blender latex foam brush so I
just decided I want to try it out it
looked cool I've never seen one of these
before it's kind of like a Beauty
Blender but it's on a stick so it's
easier to use I don't know so that is
the little brush that I got okay I also
got a few things from sapore recently so
I'm going to move into those things so I
ended up going to support off Sephora
mousse supreme cleansing foam and it's
an all-in-one cleanser and it's just a
nice like soapy light cleanser that is
just the cleanser I got it's nice and
light I didn't want anything too crazy
because when I'm doing it more deep
cleansing I'll do an exfoliate I try to
exfoliate now about two to three times a
week I got the Sephora the Sephora
instant moisturizer so this is just the
moisturizer and you just pop the lid off
and it's pretty basic so the next thing
I got and I'm really excited to try it
out but I haven't tried it out yet
because I knew I was going to be filming
this haul video this is the Smashbox
step-by-step contour stick trio so it
comes with three little sticks inside
and one of them is the one of them is
the contour one of them is the bronze
and one of them is the highlight so the
next thing I got was the Too Faced
primed and poreless pressed powder it's
a skin smoothing priming powder and it's
in the color transparent I've been
obsessed with my pressed powders being
transparent lately and this is my new
absolute favorite I find it actually
does really help minimize my pores which
is really cool because it is just a
powder next I got a little blush from
Sephora and this is just from the
Sephora brand and I got it in romantic
rose and I just thought it was a really
pretty color for spring so the last
thing I picked up from Sephora was just
this Makeup Forever aqua brow and it's
actually waterproof so I got it with
this Anastasia brow brush which has the
like the flatter end on one side and
then the spoolie brush on the other for
combing at your brows and I just I went
up to the guy I was like I'm in dire
need of something that's actually gonna
help me shape my brows so he actually
picked this out and then put it on me at
the store and I fell in love so I picked
this out and now that we're done the
beauty items I'm going to move right
into the fashion and clothing portion of
this haul you're definitely gonna be
seeing a lot of these clothes and stuff
very soon in many
and blog posts so I'm just gonna jump
right in so I ended up ordering just
quite a couple things from Charlotte
Russe and it came in so the first thing
I got and I actually was wearing it last
night which is why I don't have the tag
on it anymore but I believe it was $21
for this top so I like the top of this
and how it kind of comes in closer
around the neck and it's in a really
really different material it's nice and
stretchy but definitely firm I really
really enjoy the material of this and
basically it just kind of flares out at
the bottom and next I ended up picking
up a leather vest so the leather vest
was actually $28.99 and this is what it
looks like here it's got the bit of
quilted detailing up at the top some
silver buttons and such and the zipper
is along the side which I thought was
really cool and I actually have an
outfit post in mind for this vest but
it's really really light and really nice
and I just love the material and it's
quite quite cheap and affordable the
next thing I got was an a crop top and
this crop top was $15 and this is what
it looks like here it's another one of
those high necklines I've been obsessed
with them lately you're gonna notice so
this is what it looks like it's like a
blush tan color underneath or a blush
topi type of color underneath and then
it has this black lace detailing over
top of it and my absolute favorite part
is like the lace that comes off right
off the ends here so it looks really
really nice against your skin when
you're wearing it the next thing that I
got and I was super super excited for is
this skirt here so it's just this red
skirt and the lining in the skirt
actually stops higher than the mash does
so the mesh lace goes longer which is
really really in right now definitely
been seeing that trend quite a bit
lately so this is the skirt I got and it
is a nice like very rich like burnt red
color and I just think it's so cute and
yeah and on the topic of skirts the next
one I picked up was for $16.99 it's just
a normal black skirt here material is
very very very stretchy and you just
have to have like a good skater skirt
that's black and I you lost mine so I
needed a new end and this is the one I
picked up from Charlotte Russe
the next thing I have to show you guys
from Charlotte Russe is another crop top
and I wanted another top like the one I
first when I showed you with a high
neckline but
cropped version of it and this is again
in the same material it's stretchy but
firm and I really really like it but has
a nice high neckline and my favorite
part about it is actually the back there
has a nice little strap of detailing in
the back and it Criss crosses the straps
and then you just buttons up in the back
as well last but not least the last
thing I have to show you guys some
chelators is a pair of sunglasses and I
almost actually picked up the Ray Ban
version of these before going to Cuba
but I was afraid of spending that much
on sunglasses only to lose them or break
them so when I saw child abuse had a
similar style pair I picked these ones
up instead and $6.99 is a lot more
feasible than $200 so these are the
sunglasses I picked up they are the
retro-themed
with the frame and then no frame around
the bottom just the metal so these are
the sunglasses I picked up and yeah I'm
actually really really pleased them wish
they were just a tad bit bigger like
frame wise but I really like them and
obviously I saved a lot more money
buying these than buying the $200 ray
ban pair but who knows maybe I'll invest
one guy so that is all I have to show
you guys from Charlotte Russe I'm going
to now move on to just one item that I
have some just Kingsly which is actually
a clothing line that Melissa Merck and
her cousin recently launched and I
picked out a pair of pants from there
and I'm in love with them so these are
the April shower pants and they are the
type of pants that are nice and loose
and kind of free so I wanted a cute
little pair of printed pants like this
for this spring and summer and I already
have an outfit in mind that I'm going to
do with this once the snow melts away
and I can get outside in these type of
pants for a blog post I have the cutest
open in mind for these pants and I'll
leave the link to their website down
below as well as Melissa as YouTube so
you guys can check them out for yourself
and now I'm going to go into garage and
then finally forever 21 so from garage I
actually recently went there and I just
picked up three things so the first
thing I picked up was actually this
poncho and if you guys don't already if
you guys don't follow me on Instagram or
anything you wouldn't know that I
actually did a blog post with this
poncho so I'll leave the link to the
blog post down below so you guys can go
check it out and yeah so this basically
just an oversized
see big comfy thick cozy poncho it was
only 35 which I have to say for garage I
was quite I was expecting it to be quite
a bit more expensive so it's really
happy when I saw that it was only $35
and I picked it up and then I actually
also picked up two little bra lats one
of them I'm not gonna be able to show
you because I'm wearing them but it's
just the exact same one as this one here
but in black so this one is just a
little baby pink one and it's the type
that has all these straps in the back
here and finally I'm going to move into
these things I got from forever 21 so
when I went into the store I actually
ended up picking out these shorts here
so these are the shirts I picked up from
the Times Square forever 21 and I saw
them and they screamed Taylor Swift to
me because there was a show where she
performed and she was wearing shorts
very bedazzled like these ones so I
picked these ones up and I think there's
going to be so cute for going out in the
spring and summer I'm sure you won't be
surprised by these pajamas because they
are definitely me they were only 15
dollars and 90 cents and they were in a
2-pack so the first part of the pajamas
is this shirt here and it says my heart
belongs to coffee tell me that that is
not meant for me to buy like I saw these
pajamas and I was like okay really like
how am I supposed to scroll buy this
shirt so these are the shorts that come
with them and again oh my gosh they are
black with white coffee mugs all over
them I don't think I can find pajamas
that suit me more than these pajamas so
next I picked out this bag here and
again I have blog posts and stuff all in
vine for these things so you might
realize you might notice that these are
a bit more accessories than clothing but
yeah so these are this is the bag I
picked out it's just a black quilted bag
so this bag was actually only $33.90
versus like the two to 300 you'd spend
on a designer bag so that is the little
quilted black bag that I got next thing
I ended up picking out was this plaid
dress here
so it's got navy blue red and white
detailing in it
then it has a little brown belt that
cinches around the waist to give you a
little bit more shape still while
wearing it and it goes down into a
little dress and I just thought this was
so cute and I had again an outfit in
mind for this and of course what is a
dress without a bag to go with it so I
picked up a brown bag
not just for that outfit guys I also
picked up a brown bag because I was in
need of a brown bag so the only brown
bag I have is really old and it has
fringes all over it and I wanted just a
normal brown bag for when I don't want
to rock my fringe one so this is the
fact that I got and I love it because
it's so big and spacious and it gives
you the option to use the over the
shoulder strap and it's Brown so it's
gonna match all my little chestnut boots
and booties and it just made me so happy
so this is the little brown bag that I
got from forever 21 next I picked up a
pair of booties from forever 21 and I
had no boots that looked like this and I
have again an outfit post of mine I
started gosh and I've said that for
every single thing okay so these are the
boots that I picked up they are just
like faux leather boots and they are
adorable they are definitely heeled so
they have just a little belt up at the
top here so these are the boots I picked
out and I'm obsessed with them I find
them so cute and they can take any
casual outfit and make it like dressy
casual so I love these boots and then
last but definitely not least I picked
up one more bag from from forever 21 I
know it seems like I got a lot of bags
there because I did but I just love that
forever 21 has so many different styles
of purses and bags and such and they're
so affordable so my entire purchase from
forever 21 it was cheaper than me
getting one designer bag so just keep
that in mind if it looks like I got a
lot of bags so this is the little bag I
got here and I've been wanting something
like this for a really long time
it's a faux leather knapsack they are
gold chains handles or straps sorry with
little black faux leather quilted
through them so that concludes this haul
I hope you guys enjoyed this really
really really really way to early spring
