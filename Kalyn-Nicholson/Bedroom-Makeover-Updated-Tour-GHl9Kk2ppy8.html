up my bed since I've made it
okay so I am officially redoing up my
bedroom it's just about that time like
ever since I've moved in here my bedroom
always kind of was on the backburner I
was always working on like my office
area and like my living room and stuff
so it's about time that I officially
like really put in the effort and
decorate winter when I figured I would
do it like a rue makeover with you guys
this is gonna be the before shots of
what my bedroom looked like and some now
that you guys have seen the beginning
results let's get to work and I just
wrote down a bunch of like little ideas
of things I need so that way when I go
out shopping for stuff that I need in my
bedroom I'm not just kind of like
aimlessly grabbing things let's get
shopping
hello now that I have officially
finished shopping there's a lot of
things that I was looking for that I
didn't find but then there were also
some things that I found that I wasn't
really looking for so yeah now that I'm
finished and completes I will give you
guys a full tour of my bedroom just a
few tips to keep in mind if you are
redecorating your room one is to give
yourself a budget or two if you don't
have any money to put into it
seriously guys changing around the Fung
Shui okay moving around your furniture
can give like your whole room just like
a brand new feel and a new vibe and all
of that fun stuff also really really
cozy lighting I feel like is super super
important especially for me I'm just I
really dig like having a bunch of
different like soft lighting in
different areas around my room so I
don't have to use the overhead light or
like my lamp and then last but not least
is to come up with a sort of like color
scheme or theme so the theme for mine
was definitely like grays and whites and
then I have a couple touches of pink
just a tiny tiny bit and like kind of
like a city theme a little bit so
without further ado let's get to the
tour of my brand-new bedroom okay so
this is what you see when you first kind
of like walk through the doorway to my
room so if you guys watched my apartment
or my bed was originally like in the
middle of this wall here but I ended up
pushing it back to that wall which gave
the whole room so much more space so
I'll walk in and give you guys an
overall of what everything looks like
now okay so let's start with the bed my
bed itself is from JISC I got it last
summer it's actually got drawers
underneath which I keep a bunch of my
clothes in and then I bought the bedding
today I got it from home cents which is
like a t.j.maxx if you guys are in the
States so it came with the duvet itself
and the quilted blanket and then there's
also two quilted pillow sheet saucer
pillows I have two of these big sham
pillows those are also from home cents I
got those last year and then I have two
of the quilted pillows which is like my
actual pillows that I sleep with these
two here from Sicily all of these right
here from society6 and of course what
would a room tour be without a tapestry
so I also picked up this tapestry from
society6 it's in the
sighs large and it's just in marble and
then also at the end of my bed is my
guitar so then beside my bed is my
nightstand a nightstand is also from
just this candle here is from Target
when we had a target this little deer
head guy is from Walmart and then the
lamp is also from Target but again
Canada doesn't have target anymore and
then right beside there I picked this up
today because I used the old one that
was in here for my office room cubicle
thing that I picked up from Walmart on
the top I have my record player my mom
got me this for Christmas in the first
little square I have a bunch of my
records in the second one I picked that
up today it is from HomeSense
it's just like a little silver pot with
pink fake flowers and then I have a
crystal they're from Marissa lace she
gave me a bunch of crystals from her
shop light love light love and lace so
be sure to go check that out I'm down
here I just have this little like square
cage thing I picked this up today from
home since I haven't put anything in it
yet and I have this picture frame here
the frame itself is from HomeSense and
that's a photo from like a photo booth
of my Nana and Papa when they were
really young I think they were like 16
at the time and I don't know it's just a
really cute black-and-white photo of
them so then on the bottom shelves I
just have this little kiss me goodnight
you guys have seen that in my room tours
before and then this crystal that
changes color it's kind of hard to see
in the daytime but I will put a clip in
right here of what it looks like at
night time and then right here are just
like a bunch of my old journals and a
wreck this journal' so that concludes
what's all in this little cubicle think
of that I just have my dreamcatcher in
front of there I just got this rug today
it's like a faux fur white rug and I got
it from home cents and then of course
there's my fireplace which you guys have
all seen before but I always get asked
where it's from so it is from Rona for
those of you guys that are curious on
top I just have my TV and my Wii console
and my digital cable box as well and
then up top here I just did this little
DIY today I'm probably going to redo it
with more wire lighting because I feel
like it's just so small but that's what
it looks like for now so we'll leave it
so then beside my fireplace I just have
my little sitting area it's like a
reading areas so the chair itself is off
of Kijiji I actually bought it off of
somebody and pretty sure she told me it
came all the way from the UK and
little pillows on top are from JISC I
got those today they were like three
dollars each which was super cheap and
then I have this little side table tray
from home since I got it today it's
silver and then it has like a marble top
candle birthday cake is also from home
cents and then the reading lamp that I
have beside it there is actually from
Bed Bath and Beyond and the really cool
thing about this reading lamp is on the
base you can plug stuff in like right
there and then there's also a USB outlet
to charge your phones and then plugged
into my lamp I strung it these little
like bulb lights all the way around
until the edge of my bed and then just
beside my chair is just my closet I love
that the closets in this apartment are
like mirrors because it just makes the
bedroom look so much bigger and also
it's just killer for when you're like
trying out outfits stuff like that hey
so yeah that is a tour of my new bedroom
that I just redecorated today I am in
love with how it turned out and this is
what my room is going to look like in
the night time it's actually not
nighttime right now I just shut the
blinds but I figured it would give you
guys a good idea of what everything will
look like in the dark so that was it for
