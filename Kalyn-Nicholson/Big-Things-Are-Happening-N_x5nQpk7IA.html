you're inside
good morning guys and welcome back to
the 12 days of Christmas sorry I look
like a drowned rat right now I woke up
not too long ago and I haven't gotten
ready yet because I'm filming my lazy
holiday morning routine hence why I'm
still in my pajamas and my maximum code
sweater which I will also leave a link
to down below this is part of my merch I
don't know if you guys knew that I came
up with merch but I came up with March
so if you guys want to twin and get this
maximum clothes sweater I'm gonna leave
that link down below too but yeah so it
is what days it's Monday I just booked a
massage for this week which is super
exciting I found an old gift card when I
was like starting to pack up my stuff to
move and it was just like such a
blessing in disguise I found a hundred
dollar spa gift card so I was like you
know what I could go for a massage and I
also booked my elevator for the day that
I move which is so flippin exciting I
did a tarot card reading last night and
it basically said I'll leave the link to
it so many links but I'll leave the link
to it down below if you guys want to try
it out it's free it's just like you pick
six cards based on the six questions and
it kind of gives you an overall look at
what your life is like kind of but mine
pretty much said that like even though
there's a lot of change happening it's
like good change and then I can expect
like a move which was weird that it said
that and it also said that I can expect
a lot of positive at success in the next
little bit not that I was scared or
anything but I mean moving to a
different city is always a little
nerve-wracking and overwhelming because
there's so many things you have to get
done and it's all happening right on top
of Christmas yeah that's kind of like my
life update some exciting time of the
year you know
I'm looking for a chance
good morning guys it is well it's not
even like morning anymore it's pretty
much lunchtime I will leave the meal
prep I did for Sunday down below so it's
Tuesday afternoon it is just after 12:00
I'm just finishing up this episode of
The Secret Life of the American teenager
I don't know why but I'm so freaking
obsessed with the show right now it's so
mindless it's so corny I can't handle it
scorn like my brother and I were
watching it last night and like cringing
it is that corny but it's like you guys
have those shows where you're just like
I don't know why I like this show so
much but I can't stop watching it just
after this I'm gonna head out into
Christmas shopping and I'm gonna bring
you guys with me shall we
this could be enough
to be loved
I was supposed to take my closet down
last night
you know this grand old thing behind me
that you see here oh well I'm just gonna
have to do to all the things that I left
off with yesterday today be like this
might be extremely interesting because I
have to take pictures of how it's all
done because I need to be able to put it
back together
Wednesday morning project

which is kind of like a little bit sad
it's kind of slowly starting to register
that I'm moving I got that done today I
got my workout done today and now I am
just about to head out it is Maggie's
birthday dinner tonight if you guys

probably have but my roots are out of
this world I have that like 7:40 go out

update I have it's so weird seeing this
closet such a mess like it's no longer

so exciting so it is now Thursday um I
really went and got my roots done and my
hair done today and it took five and a
half hours that's how long it takes to
do my hair guys it did my hair is very
deceiving it is super frickin thick I'm
gonna spend the rest of the night

tired that I probably won't do anything

things that require me to leave
