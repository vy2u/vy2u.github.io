living downtown now so you're gonna hear
a lot of that so I teamed together with
covergirl to bring you guys some really
awesome tips on how to make your eyes
look bigger along with tips on how to
get some Heelys ways or texture which is
not only super in this summer but it was
also highly requested with a lot of the
pictures I've been posting lately on
like the waves that have been going in
my hair a lot of it is natural but I do
do a little trick I do do I do a little
trick to get a little bit extra move to
the waves so if you guys want to find
out how to get bigger looking eyes and
heatless waves then just keep watching
so to start out my first tip is to take
a matte color that is a topi type of
color or a lighter brown and take a
fluffy brush and blend this into your
crease this is going to create a deeper
set looking crease making your eyes look
a lot bigger and then and my next tip is
to take some metallic colors so you
could get like a darker metallic color
and keep it on the outer corner or you
could go with a medium toned or like
this one here a lighter tone and pop
this on the middle or on your inner
tear-duct which is gonna cause there to
be a light reflection there making your
eyes pop and seem a lot bigger and this
is extremely important when doing the
lighter color in the inner tear-duct and
under your brow bone because it's gonna
make your eyes look light and open and
awake so the next with my covergirl
intensify me a liquid eyeliner I'm using
the thinner end of the paddle tip brush
to kind of make my line and then I'm
using the thicker end to fill it all in
and create a little cat eye this is a
really really easy eyeliner to use and
then I wanted to create some extra
definition on the bottom and to make
your eyes look bigger try to only keep
your liquid eyeliner where your lashes
are and not bring it all the way into
your inner tear-duct because that will
close off the eye so just try and use it
on the outer corner of your eye which is
really going to make them look awake and
big but without closing them off
and I'm skipping the false lashes and
going rate for my covergirl of the super
sizer mascara this has been my new
favorite for wearing when I don't want
to wear fake lashes but I still want to
have that giant lash or fake lash look
so that was just one coat there but I
end up building about two to three coats
and making sure to kind of twist the
brush as I go from the front and from
the back so this mascara is the mascara
I've been using to get really thick
really long almost false looking lashes
without having to do the hassle of fake
lashes so this isn't my new absolutely
favorite mascara so that is the entire
tip routine I have for getting bigger
looking eyes and as for some extra
texture or waves into your hair I just
kind of go with my natural hair and part
it however I want to wear it and then on
each side I do this little French twist
so I start at the top and twist away
from my face and then I just add in hair
as I go and pull him at the bottom and
just keep twisting around into a donut
and then secure it into place
this is best to do with lightly damp
hair which my hair was a little bit damp
still from the shower but you can do
this with dry hair to just add a little
bit of product or spray into your hair
so that it actually holds
and then of course you just do the exact
same thing to the other side and once
you've secured them into place I like to
leave it for about 15 to 20 minutes
depending on how damp your hair is but
once it feels dry just go ahead and
unsecure the elastics and let your hair
loose shake it out a bit with your
fingers and then I'm just going to add a
little bit of product to my hair so that
it doesn't seem really dry or straw like
I just add a little bit of leaving
conditioner so that it feels nice and
soft
so those are my little tips and routine
for getting bigger looking eyes as well
as some natural texture or wave in my
hair I hope you guys enjoy and I'll be
seeing you guys in a lot more summer
videos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
