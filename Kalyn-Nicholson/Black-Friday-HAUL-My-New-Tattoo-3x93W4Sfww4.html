I was waiting a minute darkest nights
buzzy always hurt when you need him oh
well top of the morning to ya I totally
slept in today it is currently 905 in
the morning I was planning on getting up
at 7:30 and going for a run I'm supposed
to meet Kat for some shopping today is
actually Black Friday even though that's
so not a Canadian thing Canada is trying
to make it a Canadian thing so there's
some sales and stuff going on besides
the point I'm getting way ahead of
myself I'm getting a little bit of a
late start to my morning but it's Friday
so I feel like that's totally okay and
I'm like when I say I just woke up I'm
not kidding you this is me in all of the
glory that is just waking up so don't
judge me feel like it just felt so long
since I've logged so I definitely knew I
wanted to vlog this weekend there's a
bunch of really fun stuff that I'm gonna
be doing in this vlog and tagging you
guys along with me so first things first
I'm doing my normal morning routine it
has been my latest obsession to make a
coffee come in and sit down at my
computer and I'll read my horoscope
which is literally what's open right now
totally unspun surd and being 100% real
with you guys the best place I think to
read your horoscope is Elcom because
they got the astrotwins to do it and I
don't know why but it always just seems
to be the best one so I'm just taking a
gander at you know what my life might be
funny enough the first line of my
horoscope today tells me to hit the
snooze button even if that means missing
the Black Friday sale do you see what I
mean restoration is a must a rested mine
is a fertile landscape for creative
genius you have your white light moment
while sipping on a mug of hot cider and
staring out the window but since the
foggy day can throw off your intuition
bring a friend alongside for safety sake
well I definitely don't plan on doing
anything too crazy tonight though we'll
see so funny enough I actually ended up
vlogging I think a few days two weeks
ago a week and a half ago when I was
decorating my Christmas tree I don't
even remember what footage I got but
just in case you guys want to know or
see her and I'm not
honestly out of curiosity I want to see
what I filmed let's cut to that shall we
mr. Nicholson I like it good morning I
literally got home last night from
Mexico yes I know we haven't addressed
it yet but I cut my hair today before I
left for Mexico I went got my hair done
and I asked her to give me some bangs
they're like a mixture between Brigitte
Bardot and straight across like I can
wear them like this or they can separate
and I can do a bit more of the Brigitte
Bardot thing I'm not waiting to listen
to reputation because it came out last
night and I want to film a live
reactions which I think I'm gonna film
up today because there's no way I can go
full day without listening to it so I'm
gonna go for a run after this but really
quick I want to listen to reputation
because Maggie texted me and said it was
really good to work out too so I still
wanted to film my reactions that's what
we're gonna do and then I'm gonna go
work out to it I wish I had recorded
like my first listening to every Taylor
Swift album through history because I
can still vividly remember hearing read
for the first time I can still vividly
remember hearing speak now for the first
time when I listen to 1989 no matter
what I would feel like I'll always be
swifty
it makes sense that this is the first
song you know the next one has ed
Sheeran in it so I feel like let's go
well how is that cheering gonna fitness
yeah okay it's kind of falling Lord I
need to pump to go for a run okay
don't blame me please tell me there's a
sick beat job why everyone keeps telling
me they don't like the new album this is
this is incredible I love it I love it
this one's my favorite I am I am so here
for new tailor this is so good oh my god
the lies away
I am so excited to dance parties in this
later shake this might be my new
favorite UK dress is my favorite for
sure he's ringing oh my god okay so that
wait was that it no I wanted to Lux that
was that was that was so good
belly is officially home I'm like
low-key little sax I've packed up all of
my my Halloween stuff I'm gonna have to
go put it in my storage locker tomorrow
which is a little sad but I'm ready to
start pulling out all the Christmas
stuff red number two of the vlog today
I'm switching over to the east because I
was googling a bunch of stuff of the
beats that I have and apparently they
die if it's closer than zero degrees
which it is in Toronto we picked up my
new Christmas tree if you guys remember
my Christmas tree from the last three
years we haven't have run with that
Christmas tree actually but all the
lights burned out we're gonna put up the
tree we're gonna make cookies I'm gonna
make Greg watch out have you seen Oh
so that was all the footage that I had
prevail OGG and then it was just one of
those things or I don't know what
happened but like four days went by and
I hadn't blogged anything so I was like
ooh this is gonna work now currently
nine ten
meaning it's been five minutes since
we've begun I need to take that leave
for a quick walk and then I'm gonna try
and go for a run I'm not sure I'm
probably gonna go them all looking
pretty ratchet actually I enjoy shopping
and my true drowned rat nature it just
it feels more right I don't know why
when I'm too dolled up and I'm shopping
I get like hot and I'm like like you
know like lipsticks kind of slick I just
I like being a little bit Murphy and I
know them all
I pretty much know Christmas shopping
done which was the whole goal of going
Black Friday shopping and I got a lot of
self shopping done my only justification
is that I got so much work done this
week that I feel like it's still not
justified but I'm trying to justify it
I'll start with Victoria's Secret's it's
the first place I bought stuff so from
Victoria's Secret I went and picked up
was feeling quite festive I actually was
thinking the other day about how much I
kind of wanted a new one and when I saw
the red one well its physical presence
is answering off as to what happened so
this is the road that I got from
Victoria's Secret stand up so you guys
can see it it's just like a red silky
robe this one has pockets quality
purchase there's literally nothing
better than finding out something you
bought it has pockets so the next thing
I got was this shirt here so this one I
justified because I've been running a
lot lately
running has been honestly I've been just
so addicted to it I think I told you
guys kind of in you Tober or towards the
end of you tober that my anxiety is and
was getting really bad it's the days
that I run I find it so much more
manageable and I don't know I just don't
know how to explain it so I decided to
treat myself to this this is this shirt
that I go just probably gonna wear it on
my run tomorrow last but not least I got
another sweater again solely for running
but also for like chilling I've been
really into read lately nice like pop of
color cuz usually I wear so much black
white and grey I have been running
outside despite the fact that it's like
almost December
and this is what it looks like so this
is what it looks like it's got like
slits on the sides and it's gonna be
perfect for running and for chilling
this is actually really comfortable so
that's everything I got from Victoria's
Secret next I'll do bathroom body works
so vodka Body Works was 40% off
everything in the store today here I got
the flannel the front of it and one cell
smells a little bit more subtle so I
picked up that one the next one that I
picked up was winter candy apple this
one's like this one's one of my
favorites to burn in my kitchen so I
picked this one up
my brother and I counted 63 candles and
I moved here in January and now it's
November and I have like maybe five
I've just been forcing myself to burn
that life's just too short life's too
short to not burn your candles and this
one's by far my favorite is campfire
donut can we just look at the front of
this this is so this is giving me like
some stranger things
slash like 80s vibes for some reason oh
my god it smells like crack cocaine guys
plus I love the vibe and then I picked
up a small one for my bathroom this one
is just the smoked absent if I like the
I like the they're changing things up
over about the body it smells really
good but it also just smells like like
clean so those are the four candles that
I picked up next I went to Sephora and I
basically just picked up a few little
things that I needed and some things
that I didn't my eyelash curler broke so
I grabbed the new one of those I stocked
up on some lashes because I'm completely
out so I picked up fluff and edgy mama
knows best and lie detector from velour
I was in the line and I saw a black
Beauty Blender and I didn't even really
need a Beauty Blender but I thought a
black one fit my thigh more after buying
it I realized how much I hated myself
for the fact that I was that person and
then last but not least we went into
Lucky Brand Jeans and normally I don't
shop there coz there's a lot of leather
and stuff but Kat wanted to check it out
and then while I was there they had the
sickest logo tees now mind you I know
that these
guys t-shirts but I really like wearing
guys t-shirts like Big O the pair of
jeans and a cute leather jacket these
work I might even I might even like cut
these up a little bit towards the two I
don't know we'll figure it out but the
first one I got kiss miss like are you
are you for real right now oh yeah nice
t-shirts are more comfortable than girls
t-shirts you you can't tell me different
I thought I picked up psycho but it
turned out it wasn't psycho and because
I didn't open it I just looked for the
size and left and then found out that it
was jaws and honestly I'm not mad about
it I'm not mad about it at all and then
a little ass when I got was a Jack
Daniels one all right oh yeah I am very
happy with today's purchases it was
bananas
out of those four stores we went to like
two other stores and I was like I'm
tapping out
too many human beings in one area for me
so I am now going to bake some cookies I
have to head to a dinner tonight with
some of the girls from one of my
management companies it's on my
Christmas bucket list - perfect
chocolate chip cookies and I think I may
have done it I made a batch on Tuesday
and it was the best batch I've made so
far can we witness the glory that is
these cookies right now they're like mom
mouths perfect I'm gonna try again add a
bit more should make it make a few
adjustments and then I think I'm just
gonna chill for a bit and get a bit of
worked out on my computer just switch to
a more relevant point in the near future
so yes today it's unfortunately one of
those days or about Lee needs to go get
all of his shots updated an ironic thing
about today is that Bentley and I are
both going under the needles so I love
it you guys only come-ons gonna go
you feeling okay update Bentley killed
it he does a good job and it's also
10:30 in the morning and I've yet to
have my morning coffee Who am I what
will be first thing on the list
that's so nice I love that it's now
Sunday morning I got home about an hour
ago from Gregg's I just made myself a
coffee and threw on my kiss miss shirt
today is Sunday meeting it is going to
be the ultimate Geist day I have so much
cleaning to do I have to edit this video
get it up and basically just plan my
week and clean pretty much for my day
it's gonna consist of and it's kind of
perfect because it's super cloudy and
like gloomy outside in Toronto today so
it's gonna be like the ultimate Sunday
casually through in the fact that I went
and got a tattoo so last night I didn't
know if I wanted to verbally update you
guys so I decided to just kind of like
do it
so last night Kat and I we went to this
place called a matchbox tattoo and I
went got these two tattoos touched up so
if you guys have watched my tattoo video
I should probably do an updated one
because I officially have 7 tattoos now
which is kind of crazy
look tattoos aren't your thing that's
totally cool but like I personally love
tattoos I feel like they're a really
cool way of acknowledging like certain
chapters or phases of your life so if
you guys remember when I went to Paris
this year with Atlanta we got clouds on
our fingers and when my cloud healed it
didn't heal properly but this was super
faded and then this tattoo this is my
favorite tattoo on my entire body from
the last birthday card that my Papa ever
sent me he was on the east coast so he
had to mail it to me and well it was him
and my Nana but my Nana can't see so she
couldn't write so he wrote my full name
on it and I took the Nicolson of that
and and got it tattooed on the side of
my hand so so those are the two that I
got touched up I got this tattoo a while
ago it needed to be touched up so bad
but she did a really good job I think I
like keeping the integrity of my papa's
like writing so I'm super happy about
this I feel like it looks so much better
and then I also got another tattoo okay
so this is the new one that I got but
like I've actually obsessed with it
if you guys want an updated tattoo video
where I actually go into like complete
depth of all of my tattoos like there's
not one tattoo on my body that doesn't
have multiple meanings including my new
one if you guys want that just let me
know but a general rundown of why I got
this so all of the elements have like a
symbol in terms of triangles and the one
that's upside down like the one on my
arm is the sign for water and I'm a
water sign but when I look at it from my
perspective it's a right-side up
triangle which means fire everything
that's led and put in my life to date I
think most of it I went through it so
insecure I feel and like the most sure
of and secure within myself then I have
ever in my life just a very gratifying
feeling I guess you could say I used to
be so self-conscious of the things that
made me me like being sensitive and
being you know kind of emotional and
things like that I used to try and hide
them and I used to try and you know I
just was like super insecure about it so
that's why I kind of got it you can be
water and fire you can be emotional you
can have mental health issues you can
have like the world kick you but you can
still be fire like you can still be
strong and nobody needs to tell you that
your fire like you just need to see that
your fire does that make sense it's like
kind of an illusion I don't know I think
way too heavily into these things but
that's kind of the idea behind my knee
tattoos so super happy about it I've
been meaning to get these touched up for
so long in this week that just past was
actually the anniversary of my Papa's
passing so I just felt it was right so
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoyed as for my video schedule
it's gonna be every single Sunday up
until the 12 days of camus which I
believe starts on December 14th the 13th
it starts on the 13th
so until then it's gonna be videos every
Sunday and aside from that thank you
guys so much for chela's me it was a
good time we had a good time
fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
