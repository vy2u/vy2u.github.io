basically going to be showing you guys
how to achieve this makeup look it was
highly requested after being seen on a
picture on my Instagram you guys are
asking for a makeup look for this you
guys are also asking for a tutorial for
the picture I did where I was wearing
really dark plum lips so I'm going to be
doing that makeup tutorial for you guys
as well very soon but I started out with
the Sun because it's nice and easy now I
just recreated this look because I
filmed this the other day so the only
difference between this look and the one
you guys are going to see is that I am
wearing fake lashes right now so that's
the only main difference so fake lashes
are obviously like optional you guys can
add them if you want or you guys can not
if you don't want to so other than that
for those of you asking about the decor
videos and the apartment tour we're
still moving in and we're still
decorating so I will be getting that up
but it's probably going to be more so in
September but I will be putting up a
vlog very soon of some clips of when I
was moving in so I'll be sure to keep
look for that so other than that let's
get onto the tutorial
so I'll be starting out with my
maybelline superstay and blending this
all into my skin with my Beauty Blender
making sure that it is damp so that it
blends in nice and seamlessly and I'm
just doing this all over my face and
down my neck and then I'm using my
covergirl and Olay highlighter and this
isn't a very very very light color it's
a concealer but I'm using it to
highlight underneath my eyes so I'm just
making a triangle and doing it down the
bridge of my nose my forehead and my
chin and then blending that in with my
Beauty Blender as well I'll then be
using my L'Oreal True Match mineral
powder in sand beige to cover everywhere
that I didn't highlight
and then I will be filling my brows in
with the darkest color on my brow bar to
go I do have a 25% off coupon code if
you guys are in looking for anything new
for your brows or if you need to rebuy
one or repurchase one then go ahead and
use the coupon code and then I'm using a
spoolie brush to just blend it in and
brush my brows the way I want them to go
and then using a clear gel to set them
in place
using my Rimmel stay matte powder in
transparent I'm going over the places
that we put the concealer or our
highlight area
I'm then going to be curling my lashes
now so that we don't mess up any of our
eye shadow or eyeliner later on by doing
it later so just go ahead and curl your
lashes and then I'm going to be using my
Sigma warm neutrals palette with all the
colors that I need inside I'm using this
really shimmery pretty champagne color
and putting this all over to my lid and
blending it up into the crease
I'll then be using this sandy brown
color and it is matte and blending that
into my crease as well this is going to
help all of our other shadows blend more
seamlessly I'm done taking this shimmery
dark brown color and blending this into
the outer V or outer corner of my eye
and lightly blending it into my crease I
don't want too much of this into my
crease going back to that shader color
that champagne color sorry I'm going on
with my Sigma eye shading brush in E 55
and just putting this underneath my
lower lash line and then I'm going to be
completing the exact same process with
the darker color we used and then
blending it out with a big blending
brush
I'm then taking my ELF jumbo eyeshadow
stick and Little Miss thing and putting
this into my inner tear-duct of course
on both eyes then going into my new tube
palette by the balm and using this
really pretty rose gold color called
standoffish and putting this just over
top where we just put the jumbo eye
pencil also be using this as a highlight
cutter color under my brow bone as well
and then I'm going in with my linear
intense by L'Oreal you guys know now
that this is my absolute favorite and
just lining my eyes now this eye line
look is going to be very very dramatic
so this might not be for all of you guys
but I wanted to go for a very glam
dramatic look so if you guys don't like
it that's totally okay if it's not your
thing but I do enjoy it so you can watch
really closely here on how I line my
eyes or if you guys want a more in-depth
eyeliner video feel free to comment down
below and I'll get that done for you
guys but I'm basically lining all the
way around my eyes and then going in
with a crayon to get my actual lash line
on both the top and the bottom
and this step is optional but I'm taking
this matte black color back from that
nude tude palette and going over my
eyeliner just to get rid of the sheen
look to it to make it look more
mattifying since I can't use gel liner I
don't know how
so I'm putting on my EOS lip balm just
to moisturize my lips before I do any
lipstick and then going in with mascara
I'm using the L'Oreal telescopic for my
first coat
I'm then using the Loreal voluminous for
my second coat
for bronzer I'm using the rimmel natural
bronzer and just using this to sculpt
out my cheeks as well as my hairline my
jawline and a little bit on my nose
and for blush I'm using the NYC color
wheel mosaic blush in pink cheek glow
this is a really nice natural pink and
it doesn't come off too pigmented so it
doesn't look like you're wearing a crap
ton of fake blush on your cheeks I
decided to keep the lips nude since we
have a very dramatic eye so I'm going in
with nude delight by Rimmel and then I'm
just gonna go over it with my whitening
lightening lip gloss in the color nude
this is an absolute fave of mine and
again I have a coupon code for you guys
to use if you want to purchase this
so that's all there is to this really
glam really easy neutral look that can
work for almost any eye color or skin
complexion so I hope you guys enjoyed
also I just wanted to tell you guys
really quick that I just redid my entire
blog and it is now just officially my
website so if you type into your search
engine www.catecosta.com my website will
officially pop up it's still under
renovation so just kind of bear with me
but I am working very hard at it
so be sure to go check that out I'll
link that down below thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
all in a future video bye pretty good
