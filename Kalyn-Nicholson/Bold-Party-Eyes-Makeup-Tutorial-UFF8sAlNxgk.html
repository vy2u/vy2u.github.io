and their double exposure palette to
bring you this party look so let's get
started I'm going to be doing my basic
regular foundation routine starting out
with my Annabelle CC primer and I'm just
putting this all over my face
you
and again no surprise I'm going it with
my l'oreal true match foundation and
just blending this into my skin
to highlight and conceal I'm using my
NYX HD concealer and putting this just
under my eyes to cover up my dark
circles as well as highlight underneath
there and as well on the bridge of my
nose at my forehead and my chin
and of course to set everything in place
I'm using my Rimmel stay matte powder
and just putting this on top of
everything we just did
I'm using my essence brow pencil to go
ahead and fill in my brows and since
this is a nighttime more party look you
can get a little bit more defined with
your brows than you usually do
after blending in my brows I'm then
going to be using my Smashbox double
exposure palette now this actually has
state-of-the-art coated pigments and
each of the shadows which creates a new
effect when you use them when wet such
as turning metallic amping up the
vibrancy getting deeper or adding
Sparkle so 14 shadows actually become 28
shadows and I'm going to be doing a
mixture of wet and dry looks of each of
the shadows to give you guys a good
example so I'm just starting off with
the double-ended brush and I'm just
taking a dry version of expresso and
blending this into my crease
I'll be taking a drive version of courts
and putting this all over my lid and
then I'm going to hashtag change
something by using a wet end of the
brush to go over with the exact same
color just to show you the difference in
vibrancy that it makes when you use the
wet version of the brush and it changes
in one of four ways and courts it added
up the vibrancy I'll then be taking a
dry version of the color copper and
putting this into my crease too to
deepen up the color expresso that we had
already done
I'm going back in with the wet side of
my brush and picking up more espresso
and using the wet side of the brush with
this color actually creates a deeper
look and I'm putting this on my lower
lash line as well then depending how
dramatic you want this eye look you
could use the wet or the dry end of the
brush and pick up new AR and just create
a little V on the outer corner of your
eye and then we're going to blend this
all into place now if you did this with
the dry version it would be a little bit
less dramatic but if you want really
really bold statement eyes I would
definitely use a damp version of Noir
and the best part of using any wet
version of any of these shadows is that
they absolutely will not glaze over
I'm Men just using a standard fluffy
brush that I picked up from a Walmart to
blend everything all into place and make
sure that it's more seamless I'm then
taking a jive version of failed and
putting this just under my brow bone to
highlight just under the brow and then
I'm going back in and using a wet
version of quartz to touch up the inner
tear-duct and inner corner of our eye
and really amp up the vibrancy there
I'm then going to be taking a wet
version of veiled and just putting this
on the inner part of our I just to
create a little bit more lightness and
open up the eye it just a bit more so
then I'm going in with my Revlon
Colorstay gel liner and creating a nice
winged line across my eye
and I'm just going to lightly trace with
whatever's left on the brush the outline
of the bottom part of our eye and her
inner tear-duct not creating too harsh
of a line I'll then be going in with
l'oréal's miss manga and creating two
coats of mascara on top of my lashes
and of course I'll be shaping up my
cheekbones and hairline with my NYX
matte bronzer as well and to add a pop
of color to our cheeks I'll be doing the
NYC mosaic blush for lipstick I'm going
in with my L'Oreal lipstick in nude and
just putting this all over my lips and
then going over just the middle of our
lips with my ELF shimmer lip gloss and
it's just in a peachy color and just
propping this in the middle to make our
lips look nice and big
now lashes are completely optional but I
decided to add them and that completes
this look now I'm also going to be doing
a giveaway with the double exposure
palette so if you'd like to win them a
giveaway all the rules will be down
below but all you have to do is just
tweet at Kayla Nicholson and follow
Smashbox and tweet at us using the
hashtag change something and tell me
just how you changed something recently
with your makeup looks this palette is
also going to come with the full
exposure mascara as well as a
shapematters insert with how to's for
six different eye shapes so that is the
complete makeup look I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys all in a
future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
