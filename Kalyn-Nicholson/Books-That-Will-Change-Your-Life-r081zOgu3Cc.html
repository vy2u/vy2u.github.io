of all time why do apps and accounts
lock you out after like three attempts

same password I've made in my lifetime
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video it is the
21st day of youtuber and for today's
video I'm going to be sharing with you
guys all of my must read inspirational
books this was one of those videos that
you guys have been requesting for some
time now and I wanted to film it after I
knew I had a good collection to show you
guys and now that I'm officially read
these books I'm actually gonna move on I
have a second list now of motivational
books that I want to go through so if
you guys ever want a part two or for me
to continue this on in terms of like
motivational reads or get your life
together kind of books then definitely
just let me know down below or thumbs up
this video because I can make this like
a miniseries within our like bookworm
series oh my god I should make a
bookworm playlist on YouTube why haven't
I done that yet so really quick if you
guys aren't following me already be sure
to check out my Twitter in my Instagram
I also tend to tweet out anytime I'm
reading a new book so you'll always be
updated on what I'm reading there as
well as on my Goodreads which I will
link down below and other than that if
you guys want to see my top motivational
must-read books then just keep watching
so the first book on my motivational
must reads is your about us by Jensen
Sherrill if you've been watching my
videos for some time now you've probably
heard me talk about this book a million
times I don't even physically have it
here because I've lent it out to
somebody but I do have it on my phone as
well and this is probably out of all of
the books that I could list in this
video this is probably the one that I
come back to the most and have read the
most I'm not kidding you guys I'm pretty
sure I've read you where about us like
six times now that's how addicting this
one is this is always like my go-to to
go back to whenever I'm just feeling
like I'm in a slump whenever I'm feeling
like really down about myself or like I
need that motivational boost to feel
good about not only my life but even
just my perspective on the world he says
it in the title you read it and
afterwards you just feel like a badass
if you want to go charge at like full
force and push yourself to see not only
how much you can accomplish but who you
can be and to push yourself to kind of
be your best self so I highly recommend
if you guys have not read you are about
us to give it a read if you don't like
physical reading books I love the audio
version of it as well and the best part
about this book is because I mean you
can tell by the title that it's a little
bit more laid-back but she's also just
super relatable within it and the
stories that she tells are very like you
every single story she has to tell you
about her experience in life it seems to
be like there's a memory that you can
pull up that totally relates to it so I
highly recommend it and it's definitely
my number one when it comes to
motivational must-reads my second
motivational must-read is a very close
second - you are a badass and it's
another really laid-back title called
the cell art of not okavanga this one is
by Mark Manson and this is kind of like
an accessory to the you are about acts
they go so well if you take the lessons
from both of them and mesh them together
I feel like you just cannot lose at life
like I like about this book is it stops
making everything seem so difficult and
it just whittles it right back down to
being true to who you are and just
saying screw it to everything else and
not enlike I don't care about anything I
don't care about anyone kind of way but
in a way that it shows you how you spend
your life thinking and caring about the
wrong things and it tells you how to
stop caring about those things so that
you have more time space and energy to
care about things that really truly
matter like living your best life the
people that you care about the most the
life lessons that the universe is trying
to teach us at all times so many things
like that this is also a very good book
to read if you are somebody that again
struggles with you know like self-doubt
and things like that I also found this
one helped out a lot too one thing I
recall from this book that really helped
me was he talks at one point about like
the mind spiral that we go into where
you get anxious and then you feel
anxious about being anxious and then you
feel anxious for feeling anxious for
feeling anxious and you just spiral or
you know you feel bad about something
and then you feel bad for feeling bad
and it just kind of goes into this whole
spiral that we get to in our mind
sometimes and he totally puts it in such
a way that it's so easy to pick up the
life lessons that he's learned and that
he's trying to you know share they're so
easy
integrate into your own life so I
definitely highly recommend this book
too and I also have the audiobook of
this one as well especially if you're
someone that has to drive to and from
work like for me I started listening to
audiobooks every time I Drive to Gregg's
our home from Gregg's because it is one
of the most stressful drives ever the
traffic in Toronto can be so crazy and
it can be so toxic so I find listening
to books like this in the car are not
only a great way to multitask for your
drive home but they're also just they
keep you in a positive mindset so
definitely definitely check this book
out too if you haven't already the third
books that I have to show you guys is
called bold now the story behind me
picking up this book was just a year ago
I went on an impromptu trip to LA on my
own
this was very spur of the moment at the
end of you Tober last year actually
where I just needed to get out and I
needed to like gain some head space so I
went to LA and in the airport on the way
back home I don't know why but I was
picking up water and snacks and I felt
very drawn to this book probably from
the bold print reading the front cover
it said 212 charisma and small talk tips
to engage charm and leave a lasting
impression
now maybe you're someone watching this
that totally doesn't need this book but
anyone out there that suffers with any
kind of social anxiety this book is
going to be like it's it's literally a
lifesaver I don't know how to fully
explain the feeling but if you've ever
been in a situation where sometimes even
just the most simple like etiquette ie
sink thank you saying hello to somebody
awkward silences with a stranger meeting
a boy friends parents anything like that
just seems so overwhelmingly daunting
that you get anxious or maybe you don't
get as affected as you know feeling like
full-blown panic but you get nervous and
you get unsure about what to say what's
the right thing to do this book is
amazing it honestly teaches you not only
how to go at every situation it teaches
you how to be more charismatic tells you
just small little tips and tricks to you
know be more engaging in conversation
and to hook people into you more and to
give the best impression of yourself out
there because I am like speaking from
experience I'm so I get so nervous and I
get such bad social anxiety
sometimes around people that I feel like
I'd give such a horrible impression of
myself that I seem quiet or I seem
reserved or maybe I seem like I'm
uninterested or I'm not happy not only
in my back to the spider all getting
anxious then about being anxious and
then getting more anxious about how
people might perceive my anxiety this
book is one of those books that I always
kind of try to pick up every now and
then it gives you that little bit of
confidence of having a bit of an idea of
how to deal with certain situations so
you almost have like a template and you
fill it in in the situation your aunt or
the person you're talking to so this one
has helped a lot with my social anxiety
and I highly recommend picking it up if
I can find links to all these books by
the way guys I will definitely pop them
down below by the way so the fourth book
in my motivational must-reads is
girlboss by Sophia Amoruso I actually
recently finished reading this probably
about a month ago and oh my god I was so
addicted I mean I'm sure you guys
obviously probably know from the title
that it's all about being a girl boss
it's very empowering to read especially
as a female and it's not only good for
teaching you life lessons when it comes
to you know going after your dreams
being a legitimate girl boss and just
taking control over your success and
your happiness but it also just teaches
you the fundamental mindsets and
perspective of being a confident like
girls so I feel like if you're a female
then you should read this book solely
for that reason because in our world and
in our society I definitely think we're
seeing a lot more girl bosses I think
we're seeing a lot more girl empowerment
and confidence but I still think that it
can be really hard to grow up a girl in
this world especially with social media
Sophia Amoruso is just so cool and I
just want to be her best friend and so
when you read this book it's kind of
like that it's like in a way you are
being her best friend and she's just
giving you so much not only cool
perspectives and cool stories but she
just makes you feel cool by reading it
does that make sense
so I highly recommend this book if
you're looking to get motivational not
only just for your life but also in
terms of work and success and she even
gets as informative as teaching you it
like to be more frugal with your money
and to save more this is definitely a
must read book when it comes to my list
the fifth book that I have to show you
guys is actually
by Demi Lovato and just a disclaimer I'm
not even like a massive fan I would say
of Demi Lovato I like her a lot but
she's just not normally my style of
music but that said this book is
something that I feel like everybody
could possibly pick up whether you like
reading or not this book will work for
you because it's honestly one page a day
so you don't actually have to read
through chapters you can pick it up and
go to exactly today's date and all of
them are just little life lessons some
of them start with a really motivational
quote some of them just kind of give you
a perspective to go into the day with
especially anyone out there that deals
with any sort of mental health this is
such a positive and uplifting book that
you can just pick up and read every
single morning or maybe every night
before you go to bed so for today's for
instance never give up we've all heard
this phrase countless times in our lives
it's only to living this motto that I've
come to understand why so many cliched
freezes are so truthful sometimes when
your dreams in your faith are challenged
it's not that all hope is lost instead
it just means you're being tested when
you rise above the challenges and show
the universe that you want to in spite
of everything your prayers will be
answered and your dreams will be
fulfilled goal think about what it is
you really love doing in this life and
keep chasing it so it's just kind of
little daily paragraphs like that and
there's one for every single day in the
year and some of them get your mind
working some of them just make you feel
positive before you start your day some
of them make you feel grateful so that
is I am putting it on this list because
not only is it super easy and light to
read but I also just enjoy the concept
of it and that is a little piece of like
positivity that you can read once a day
the next book I have to show you guys is
the four agreements and this is by Don
Miguel Ruiz and I believe I've talked
about this book with you guys many times
before this is one of those books that
the first time I read it I didn't fully
understand a lot of it and I remember
being confused and thinking I'm
definitely gonna have to reread this
because I don't understand what this
guy's talking about but then by the
second and third time I read it I was so
hooked and it's one of those books that
I tried to reread at least once a year
this was definitely a bit more on the
spiritual side it makes you just want to
be so pure and light after let's the
only way I can describe it and what it
is it breaks down like the four
fundamental agreements that you should
make with yourself and what the universe
and by living through those four
agreements create a reality or the dream
around yourself that becomes successful
and in a lot of ways you know the law of
attraction it attracts better things for
you and it makes your life just a
positive and an uplifting experience so
The Four Agreements that he actually
talks about are being impeccable with
your word don't take anything personally
don't make assumptions and always do
your best and by living through those
four rules that you kind of create for
yourself you can't really fail if that
makes any sense so if you do decide to
pick this book up and you're totally
confused the first time reading through
I promise you read it a second or third
time and it'll wake up your soul in such
a way that you'll feel so connected to
the world and connected to yourself I
always feel so corny when I say things
like that but it honestly does reading
books like this and the other ones that
I'm mentioning they're just such an easy
way to kind of stay connected with the
positive and the happier things in life
and also just stay more connected with
your own soul's purpose and I know that
that sounds super lame and cliche but I
just feel like in a world where we see
so much negativity on a daily basis it's
important to constantly keep little bits
of positivity in our life which sounds
like it's the outro but I actually have
one more book to tell you guys about and
that is adventures for your show and
Keiser so again I don't actually have
the physical book with me because I lent
it to my sister but basically adventures
for your soul is it's a breakdown of 21
ways to transform your habits and your
perspectives to live your life to your
full potential so in a lot of ways it's
a very similar vibe to like you are a
badass again this author kind of goes
through her journey and the part of this
book that I really connected with the
most is she's so open and honest about
the fact that you know she thought she
had life figured out only to find
herself you know feeling depressed her
falling back into bad habits and then
having to learn and work her way through
those again and I think that that is
what makes this book so good and so
relatable is because a lot of the times
and you read motivational books you you
put all this pressure on yourself after
reading it thinking okay I have to live
by this and
and there should be no excuses for me
ever failing or falling into bad habits
again or being you know grumpy or having
a bad day I should always have good days
from now on because I've learned this
incredible knowledge and it's just not
true in this book she talks a lot about
how she would constantly yoyo in and out
of having the right kind of perspectives
in life and having the wrong kind of
perspectives in life and following happy
and healthy habits and then falling back
into bad and self sabotaging habits and
so that is what I loved the most about
this book it's just so relatable and
it's so easy to connect with and it
breaks everything down into twenty-one
like easy chapters that you could
totally live by so I definitely
recommend picking it up again I had the
audiobook version of that book as well
and it was incredible so if you're
watching this and let's say you've
already read your about us and I
definitely recommend this as like
something similar if you guys enjoyed
that book as well I'm like starting to
get sick as this videos going on I've
been like sneezing and getting sick so
this concludes my top seven motivational
must-read books let me know down below
if you guys have read any of the books
that I talked about or if you guys have
any to recommend definitely let me know
so I'm looking to you know add to my
list especially if I'm gonna make this a
miniseries within our bookworm kind of
you know videos other than that I love
you guys coming back I hope you guys
have been enjoying each other so far
there's only ten days left it's like
it's one of those things where I'm super
excited because I'm there's so many
projects I want to work on the minute
you tober is over and I'm really kind of
itching to get at them but I'm also sad
because uploading dealing with you guys
has been so much fun that I feel like
I'm gonna miss you guys on a daily basis
and yeah so I will see all of you guys
in tomorrow's video bye guys
right sometimes could be anyone you
don't show the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
