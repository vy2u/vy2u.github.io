comparison between us in our last like
BFF day where both of our hair was like
down to here like orange shrieked and I
think an entire video all I did is this
yeah
we just stopped into like stabbing that
one threesomes so why not look I did the
wi-fi's only in the food areas dangerous
yeah hey guys what's up and welcome back
to my channel for today's video we are
currently in the desert we're in if you
can't already tell by our look hopefully
we are currently in Palm Springs slash
Desert Springs for Coachella I'm here
with my best friend Kristina if you guys
have been a original on this channel
then you may have already known or seen
videos with Christine in them he did a
best friend tag 2013-2014 vacation haul
from like 20 yeah we actually got the
same one in black and white as well
so what's 2014 it was 2014 that we did
one so in case anyone was worried yes I
am still alive
and and again I will link those down
below for you your pure entertainment we
have some other videos that I feel like
we can very funnily pull up
but I won't I won't like them because
they're quite
we're not right we're not there yet so
for today's video we figured it would be
kind of funny or a slash fun to do a
little bit of like a QA / Christine
grilling me with some questions because
Christine is actually extremely savage
and ruthless and funny enough I'm pretty
poised with you guys on camera but
behind the scene you have no idea we got
a little crazy so I figured it'd be
really funny to get Christine to do a
Q&amp;amp;A and to ask me some questions and we
even threw up an insta post to see if
you guys have any questions but she also
wrote up some which I'm a little afraid
of which is why we're drinking wine to
like loosen loosen things up a little
bit cheers Cheers I'm just gonna go
ahead and let him take the reins I'm
very excited it's gonna be some hardcore
journalism I have some hard-hitting
questions that you're all begging to
know I'm kind of curious to know the
answers to these questions like okay
what do I not know about sailing which
is very few things and honestly there's
some things that I do know about Kaylin
but I'm gonna ask anyways just so you
guys know the answer is we became
friends in kindergarten we we did our
natural elementary sing fallen in fallen
out but a long story short we've known
each other for 20 years we did the email
look we did in front fangs so she did
bleach blonde with black underneath and
I did black with blonde Ernie's it's
great
so it was like absolute squad goals
we've gone through puberty together
we've gone through boyfriends together
we got our like licenses pretty much
together
okay we're very important together we
worked at the old-age home together
thank you exactly what we'll shine
through in our own ways but still be but
we play off each other
I used to take the wheel go right ahead
okay so I tried to mix it up a little
bit I was like okay I'm not gonna go too
hard the whole way you know I'm gonna
give her a break keep in mind that my
father watches these videos okay shut it
dad like you all know it up so I'm gonna
ask you some basic questions to start
off to get you like okay in the mood
okay what's your name - Kaelyn Marie
Nicholson next question what would you
first wanna send me so my first one ever
was candy lover five and then it was
square minded which I got made fun of
real hard concept of being square where
we're from is it means that you've never
made out with a boy like I never kissed
a boy with Tom which in elementary
school is okay but I got my butt up for
being square Lisa passed notes back and
forth and a bunch
the guys in our grade they forgot about
this ended up realizing that Kalyan was
square I never kiss with tongue and dad
you should be proud
I had already made out before so I was
good I was in the clear I didn't do you
want to cover me she wrote in her notes
that she was square so everyone was like
okay on square like that was like a
thing that was like gossip of 2007 is
that Kalin was squared yeah that I never
kissed a boy but that's okay Tom next
question what's your color changes every
day today it is blue because I'm wearing
blue yesterday it was green but normally
it's kind of like a movie pink what's
your favorite animal Oh
elephants like here you go I'm just
going all right Adel Ola asked have you
ever liked the same guy if yes how did
you solve it Oh circle so the guy that I
did end up kissing my first kiss ever
in my elementary school crush and in
grade seven we sat side by side and he
sat in front of us and there was a phase
where we fought over him pretty damn
hard feel like we went back and forth
between being kind of open about it went
on this trip it was to the Toronto Zoo
yes and we are both like so
competitively like trying to flirt with
them first for this video his name will
be pierre anyway so we both went back
and forth like literally trying to flirt
this and there but at this point yeah I
definitely chosen Kalyan like he was
like oh like super into her like they
were together all day and I remember I
was human like I was mad I liked him for
like three years leading up to that and
I liked him for two weeks yeah so I was
something see me going after Derek who
you liked all about when she school it's
because no one would go for Derek I
didn't speak on the because it was like
a a two and a half hour bus ride home
from the Toronto Zoo and like I have a
picture from the way they're so shown
that we just got over it yeah we did
next day we just woke up and we were
like hey whatever holiday was fine
mental breakdown for me like his mental
breakdown like I'm real
sad things are going on in my life or
his mental breakdown like me right down
it's like Kim K ugly cray
so I guess yesterday was not a mental
breakdown um mental breakdown is
definitely like you're super overwhelmed
things are like getting to you in you're
always in leave Kim K ugly so yeah I
don't think I've cried in a really long
time which is kind of concerning like I
feel like I should be crying I've seen
you cry only once so when we were in
Cuba I've been I've been threatening to
leak this footage for so long you're in
Cuba and there was a lizard in our room
Carroll was a I'm gonna save him
so she grabs me a cup and like a plus of
like paper or something just to slide
underneath him and when she did is she
actually cut off part of his tail and
mind you at this point we did not know
that at this like lizards grow their
tails back but they get cut off so she
is bawling and like mind you she does
know I killed him I remember filming and
she's crying I've like literally never
seen this girl cry but more or less
stories the loser did get saved he did I
was like yeah this is good quality show
us how you really feel what do you
admire most the other person and what's
the most it
and the one thing about the other person
what kind of friend are you Chris ac-1
the nice one the traumatic one Dammam
okay so you can go first
so tell me the first part what do you
admire the most about each other like
we've known each other so long that we
kind of feel like fam so to me I can
come at you like upset about things but
I can also come at you with tacos and I
know I can already gauge your reaction
one two you'll never judge me for
anything I do say bodily functions like
and all the in-between and three I think
honestly look at my face time you or
text you at any point you'll answer like
you'll always answer what's up you'll
answer but like will mr. rush for each
other so that's the other I feel like we
should mr. rush true he was our grade 7
teacher and we always had nightmares of
him like this lots of favorite qualities
but those are the ones I can think of
right now so my favorite is definitely
when I think about our friendship and I
think about who we are I always compare
us to each other and I'm like all like
we are like literally the same person
but I do think that Kalin is the better
version of us in the sense that she's so
organized it's like insane she was
always a friend that like we were an
element
wanna be like man I didn't do my
homework on slide you might note I would
slide you might know it's my kid and she
would do it like she would just like you
know what I did it like here and mr.
utter would always be like no your
guys's answers of exact same her ability
to not give a shit what other people
think to kind of do what she wants to do
to follow her goals to follow her dreams
and to also set goals like I have never
in my entire life ever even remotely
seen anyone cycles like this girl that
actually follows the steps to follow
through with it whereas I set a goal and
I'm like that maybe next year
thanks man I feel like I need to give a
better answer now so we're talking about
friendship well I think about you as an
individual I also have more time to
think now we're just turning this into a
mush fest but like funniest person on
the freakin planet right here just
saying and to you honestly give the best
advice and it was like a thing growing
up that it was when you were applying
lipstick or straightening your hair but
just in general if like Kristen one of
our other best friends comes at you with
a problem or like Maggie comes out you
the problem your advice is so catered to
the person you're dealing with because
you're so good at like reading people
and stepping into like their shoes yeah
okay something a bit more about you than
just a psyche what's the most annoying
thing the other person does and I've
said I said this in the BFF tag the most
annoying thing Kaelyn does is when she
has to pee it she literally like does
the most obnoxious like pee dance ever
to the point where she's like I got me a
point where it's like I feel like we
both have small bladders and this girl
on the plane she was sitting on the
other side we were sitting on the inside
and like she whether one of us was
peeing the other person's pain like we
would go together kind of thing it was
like a costly really kay like excuse me
in the new throes I'm like I just got
Pete and so I was like you know what
let's just go I will come with you just
so I don't have to witness a dance
the guy would I would offer my firstborn
child to never sleep it's so aggressive
you're I'm so sorry because I know that
this is something that you can't really
check technically how high your and say
you're freaking restless leg syndrome
you're it's not better over here in hey
it is one of those things that like with
my unit I know
playing violin like watch TV and her leg
is like like repetitive sounds or
repetitive movements drives me nuts and
so I always like grab your leg and I'm
like just stop and you're like I'm sorry
man I can't open and in my mind I'm
casually watching TV I'm just like over
watching CSI Miami and I hide anything
there Nelson's bitch
and I'm like what and she begs Tommy
you're like I don't like me so what kind
of friend are you so is so how should we
do this
is it me saying what kind of friend you
are or yeah yeah let's do that examples
are like the sassy one the nice one the
dramatic one the mom so I think you are
the level-headed mom I have found you
have always been the one that kind of
takes care of our friend career but in
where it's like any time that we've ever
gone out together it's like Kaelyn
someone making sure everyone gets home
safe our kids went messaging everyone
making sure everyone stays like this
like that and you're also like the most
level-headed one that gives the best
advice and like you say I do minds like
I think you do mine is in the sense that
I feel like I'm like super empathetic so
I related to that person situation but
the advice you give is actually like
good for that situation and you know I
still think you give the best you are
the only person I will take advice from
cuz I am very stubborn I feel like
you're the rider die
you're the rider die friend where you're
down for anything like I could be like
want to come over and take a nap and
you'd be like down and then I'd be like
we want to go to Coachella
you're like down bitch elsewhere DFS
gets close with other friends I think
when we were younger we kind of did but
nowadays I'm just like sweet sisters now
so like you could be friends of whoever
you want but like I'm here till we're
old and in the old age she actually had
an indent in my bed an exacto his high
school is beginning High School's grade
9 10 there was like a literal body
indent in one side of my bed from her
okay good robot so much used a to my
house up in it and it was definitely the
one that we had two years ago three
years ago yeah we had a falling-out for
like a year this is one of those things
that is like it more so I think had to
do with the state of mind we were both
in rather than actually what we were I
don't know right because I was like I
had dated a guy like five years we broke
up and I kind of went like over it I
feel like it's just one of those things
like after high school but before you
really start your adulting life there's
this weird
in between early 20s late teens kind of
era where I think that because I got so
into YouTube so early and you like our
lives just went like this where yeah
like we just both kind of to better wait
we wanted to do different things like
that at that time in our lives and so it
kind of just made us grow apart for a
bit but then it ended up being good
because I we said that sown we rekindled
like when we got when we became super
super tight again I was like I think
that was good for us I think we needed
some breathing space to like figure who
you were figure out who I was but when
we came back together it was like you
know we got that out of our systems
I had like lived away and when I came
back I started my like party girl phase
yeah and then your YouTube career really
took off and you were so busy cuz you
were working so hard and you were like
so involved with that and like trying to
deal with all of that and like but just
like I was so reckless and careless and
I didn't have any like thoughts beside
like who I was gonna go out with that
night and like what I was gonna do and
like who I was gonna see and like blah
blah but I was always kind of envious of
that I feel because I was envious of you
to which that's oh so weird right
because I remember I wanted so badly to
almost kind of insert myself into that I
really did want to be like early 20s
just go out and have no like live my
life with more abandoned I thought that
that was really cool I think that
everyone in some phase of their life
should do that she'd kind of just like
throw caution to the wind and just have
some fun and it was that was a really
big period of me too for like anxiety
and depression and so I think that that
was like the other thing is that I would
try and go out but it would make me so
anxious that I just caught in and so it
kind of created this like mold and the
thing is is that let me clarify like I
didn't talk about these things either so
it wasn't like you knew that's why I
didn't want to go out I feel like from
your standpoint it probably seemed like
I was like like I'm too good to go out
and party but it was really like I'm so
anxious and you were like I just want to
have fun but I think to me I was like
all she wants to his party and so yeah
any moment all she wants to do is sit on
her computer and edit videos but moral
of this story is we actually did not
speak for a year yeah and actually your
which is so messed up for us it's weird
but I also feel like anyone watching
this it has a best friend like that's
also normal I feel like it's sweet it's
normal to go through like absent flows
with friendships and I honestly do think
in a weird way it was good for us we
laugh about it like we're like remember
when we were friends at one time should
we move over to your question yes so
these are a lot different than the
questions yeah you're savage I know
you're I didn't really I didn't I've
ever nothing over but I know you're
gonna give me some heart bulbs but I
feel like the people will enjoy it okay
if event you would save three endangered
species would you like a sex tape on
your own YouTube channel can it be a
classy sexy yes they come here whatever
you want it to me and they're like like
not that it makes a difference but
they're like they're like they're like
they're like like can I save can I save
those those are dying like the yes I'm
so sorry guys you would have to watch me
do the deed to see you I feel like you
guys would be cool with that if I posted
it love making films let's say that we
did it in a classy way to save three
animals guys I think we would do it what
is something that I don't even know
about you I mean if it's not like super
like interesting or like different cuz I
feel like anything interesting I would
know myself I think I kind of told you
about this more so on this trip but I
don't think he knew it before this but
like the whole like what I meditate I
have like very strong premonitions right
like I think I might be not psychic but
I think that there's just like weird
thing like I was telling her about my
meditations where I talk to my Higher
Self which is weird but I think that was
so that you didn't really know up until
now like meditation is one thing but
then to like so somebody that's like yo
I was meditating and I had this vision
like I have a vision yes when I meditate
and I think that wasn't something you
knew until now how do you ever
experience experiment 'add with girls no
but you know I've made out before that's
experimental I've never been in how was
I you were great you guys are really
getting the inside scoop here all this
lap dance contest so we just went we
were just like we could win this you're
literally like my family so I was just
like let's do it
talking about how we got one of the
bartender's who was like very
good-looking to leave the bar and get
someone to cover his bars but he could
let us give him a laugh cancer it's one
of those things where like so there's
this girl that was down by the pool for
the last two days that we've been like
this girl's so perfect she's so hot but
it's never been something where it's
just like I'm actually attracted to
girls but I find the female essence so
beautiful and so elegant I guess so I'm
mesmerized by females cuz I think that
we as females
I think that there's something that is
so well some about us because Mother
Nature is in a sense feminine and so I
find the feminine persona to be so so
cool and female bodies are so beautiful
exactly I'm such a guy's guy like I I I
love me a good man I don't think I'll
ever double in that pool because I just
love me a good man but all power to love
and whoever you love love we love kind
of thing okay but your thoughts on drugs
and illegal substances
I believe that everybody's very
different on this topic and I can only
speak for my own personal experience I
find that drugs are not for me any harsh
drugs any chemical drugs and and not
that kind of gal but you hand me a plant
and I might be about it
maybe you could stab one tuber who would
it be like I midnight they wouldn't like
be like super injured they would just
like if I could paper cut a youtuber
yeah and like in honesty it doesn't
matter because you hate them but it's
because you dislike them the most than
the rest can we make it paper cut fine
sorry what who said that that's question
like do somebody really usually the way
I wouldn't stab her but I would just
want to sit down and be like listen I
love your message but like can we just
change the way you do it
she made me begin like I used to
freaking love really you know that Logan
would you stop hoggin Paul I am so okay
I feel like this is I would do more than
pay back at Logan Paul feel like I'm so
like Switzerland on YouTube I don't like
to give too many opinions about these
things
I sell shit like I so you stay out but I
would have to say I'm so sorry I want to
apologize but if I had to paper cut
anybody you would probably be Logan Paul
okay I like that answer
I feel like unanimously the whole world
has decided that he sucks what do you
have a threesome and answer that first I
don't even think I could I don't think I
could in my current relationship I would
never have a threesome but if I was
single I would have a threesome with
randoms you could do it like I couldn't
do it in a situation though to make me
jealous like with my boyfriend it would
drive me nuts like I could never imagine
him what about you how to do like you
would two dates I could do that if I did
it would be like we were 50 things were
getting a little stale yes nice me does
not buy some things up in our like later
life our kids are growing up and maybe
gone
College so I'm gonna go ahead and end
this off in a wholesome now kaylynn
excluding Bentley your friends or family
or job okay that most obvious answers to
this what are you most thankful for ah
passion mixed with a little bit of the
newfound connection I feel to like the
universe that sounds kind of weird it's
something that I kind of see that I've
kind of dabbled with it before but I
feel like in the last little bit I've
really kind of found this relationship
with the universe in this relationship
with meditation and yoga and it has
become such a safe haven for me that I
have to say if those things are the
exclusion then my next runner-up would
definitely be that sense of spirituality
I guess you travel travel it's like I
would be something go for all the
trouble she just like Eat Pray Love just
carry oh dear travel and spirituality /
like yoga meditation isn't is it you're
yourself of each dance elephants each
dance elephants that's what I thought
into into into intention what about you
what would you say I am most thankful
for tapas I'm also super thankful to be
here in Desert Springs California with
my best friend right now like I'm not
even just saying that because of this
moment it has been one of the best
experience of my entire life I could
tell that we both kind of needed this
