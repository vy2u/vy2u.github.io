video I'm going to doing another makeup
tutorial for those of you that aren't a
big fan of makeup tutorials I will be
doing a lot of other videos very soon as
well but there were two looks that I
uploaded to Instagram recently and
basically a lot of you guys are asking
for makeup tutorial and the video I'm
going to be showing you guys two
different options for the lips a
high-end way and a drugstore way so if
you don't want to break your bank doing
this look then I definitely have some
affordable ways for you guys to achieve
this if you guys decide to try it out I
would totally love to see it so please
tweet it at me or tag me in it on
Instagram and I'll be sure to check it
out get thumbs it up or whatever you do
on those things like favorites and
comments and such so other than that I'm
going to jump right into the tutorial
and I will see you guys all in a future
video bye so I'll be using my ELF cream
foundation with my Sigma flat brush and
just basically pushing us all into my
skin and blending it out so that it is
seamless this is a really really nice
foundation it is a really nice finish
and I love it and then I'm going in with
my covergirl concealer to highlight the
bridge of my nose the middle of my
forehead underneath my eyes and brow
bone and all that fun stuff and then I'm
just using a damp Beauty blender to
blend that in and that will soak up any
of the excess concealer that I didn't
need either
I'll be using my Rimmel stay matte in
transparent to go over the places that I
put the concealer or the highlight and
then just blending that in and then I'm
going in with my L'Oreal True Match
mineral powder and putting that on
everywhere else and of course to fill in
my brows I'm using my brow bar to go
which is like my Holy Grail brow product
so I'll leave links and all the products
down below and I have a coupon code for
this too so all that fun stuff will be
down below and on my blog if you guys
want actual detailed descriptions of all
the steps that I'm using then I'm going
ahead and curling both of my lashes and
then going in with Sigma's eyeshadow
primer and I believe is in the color so
again I'm using my Sigma warm neutrals
palette and I'm just going in and taking
this really pretty shimmer color and
putting this all over the lid of my eye
or the eye of my lid I don't even know
anyways I'm just using my finger to put
that all over and then I'm taking this
matte Brown taupey color and blending
this into my crease with my tapered
blending brush
oh yeah already you don't roll I'm also
taking that taupe color and bringing it
underneath my lash line as well and then
I'm going in with this burgundy color
this is a really pretty burgundy and it
has just a tiny bit of shimmer to it and
I'm focusing that on the outer be or the
outer corner of my eye and then lightly
blending it inwards when there's only a
little bit left on my brush and that's
gonna give us a really deep set crease
with this really pretty Burgundy and
then of course I'm putting that halfway
on my lower lash line as well and then
I'm going in with this matte highlight
color and putting this just under my
brow bone I'm not going in with my
mary-lou manizer and putting this in the
inner tear-duct of my eye so going in
with my L'Oreal telescopic I'm just
gonna put a nice and light coat on my
top lashes and then I'm going in with
our doubts about those lashes these are
pretty crazy lashes you guys can skip
this step or you guys can get a little
bit more of a subtle lash it's totally
up to you but I decided to go with false
lashes for fun and obviously I'm just
putting these in on both sides and these
ones are pretty crazy but I like them
and then I'm going back in with my
L'Oreal telescopic I'm adding a couple
coats on to my bottom lashes
and then of course I'm contouring my
face with my Rimmel bronzer and then
adding a touch of blush too now the
blush I'm using is berry shimmer by Wet
n Wild it's a really really pretty
burgundy kind of blush so it's really
really nice for this look and it was
incredibly affordable I believe it was
like $2 or $3 from Walmart so yeah I'm
just popping this on my cheeks as well
and then blending it in so I have both a
high end and a drugstore option for lip
liners and for lipsticks for the lip
liner I'm using the Loreal infallible in
red wine and for the high end I'm using
Mac's beet and then for lipsticks I'm
using NYC 320 in mahogany which was a
dollar 98 and the high-end is the dark
side by Mac so those are both of those
options and then I'm just using the
Revlon lip gloss I'll leave the name to
that one down below so here I'm showing
you guys the drugstore option of the
dark plum or dark burgundy lip so I'm
using the Loreal 24-hour lip liner and
just putting this all over my lips and
then putting the NYC mahogany right on
top of that so you can see this is a
really really nice pretty look for a
really affordable price but if you guys
wanted to invest in a more higher-end
you guys could use the Mac options that
I have shown you right pretty much after
this so I'm just wiping it off my lips
and then going ahead and doing the exact
same process with the Mac one the only
thing I have to say about the Mac that I
noticed is that it just lasted a little
longer throughout the day I didn't have
to reapply as much as the NYC but both
are great options
in this hardik like it's a drug relapse
and um back crash I'm gonna die I'm
fallin on
dottie get worse let the bottle pour it
in down out all these bestop's let's
just go back in the story we play to the
day that you prayed that I never stray
off and right after you add your pop of
lipgloss you are done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this look and let me know if you
have any more fall makeup requests down
below
so I hope you guys enjoyed this look I
actually wore this in a very recent blog
post where I'm transitioning outfits
from summer to fall I will be doing a
related video sort of to that kind of
theme so I'm doing a fall inspired
outfits video very soon which you'll
probably see this looking as well so
again feel free to try it out and show
it to me if you do and other than that I
will see you guys all in a future video
