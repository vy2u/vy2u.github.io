hey everyone that what's up and welcome
back to my channel for today is a Monday
video I'm going to be doing it get ready
with me except this is gonna be the
first video and a full series that's
gonna go on this entire year I'm sure
you guys already know by the title that
today's video is going to be a get ready
with me but it's gonna be Capricorn
inspired all the time you guys see this
will be just over the halfway point of
the Capricorn in the astrology chart so
I thought it would be really cool
throughout the whole year zodiac sign
inspired get ready with me is every time
I get ready for anything I always kind
of try and find a theme so I feel like
doing one of these for all of the
zodiacs that the year would be really
fun and which is why we are starting out
with the good old Capricorn really quick
if you guys aren't following me already
I'm going to pop my Twitter in my
Instagram right here I've also been
posting things like my 28th teen at
resolutions to my blog and since I got
asked this question all the time if you
guys are curious what website I use to
read my horoscope then I will also link
that down below on Twitter people are
always like what was the website you
said again so for all of these all
always just link the website that I use
for horoscopes I've always been really
into horoscopes I like on my birth chart
done I don't take it so seriously that
like I'm you know buying a lot of
tickets with my lucky numbers every day
but I do look at horoscopes for like a
little bit of inspiration I feel like
horoscopes are one of those things that
people are either super into it or super
not I think there's a lot of things that
don't have scientific proof and I think
anything in life is what you make out of
it so that's kind of my view I also just
find them really fun I've been getting
really into the whole league spiritual
realm lately so that's that if you guys
want to see if my hair make up an outfit
inspired by the good old capricorns of
the world then just keep watching
slang get on so cold face mug I tried to
pick something that was a little
Capricorn s you know Capricorn's are
very driven and very creative
I should make Oreo coffee if I who
should go to shark tank for an Oreo
coffee creamer so starting off what is a
get ready with me without her trusty
Bentley ears I have one extra pair of
these I've ended up buying two you guys
actually enter a good way to win Bentley
ears because I know I would but I'm
biased it's my dog and I'm obsessed with
them I'll try and find more but I have
one right now so if you guys want to win
it somehow do a giveaway with them or
like pick somebody to send them to then
let me know so starting off Greg is
actually a Capricorn so I have some
first-hand knowledge when it comes to
them I actually really thoroughly enjoy
researching horoscopes so I like read
out his horoscope all the time or like
when you're reading those like horoscope
things you read yours but then you read
the people that you also know like I
always read Sagittarius because my best
friend Maggie is Asajj and I always read
Capricorn because of Greg I always read
Taurus because of like Christine and my
brother my dad research almost the
correlating horoscopes to the people
that I am like super close with so I
personally know a Capricorn
who I'm quite fond of so their zodiac
symbol is the fish goat hybrid zodiac
element is earth which is why if you
notice behind me I've changed up the
background I'm gonna take these zodiac
get ready with me so seriously you have
no idea like oh by a plant and I also
put the deer up because even though
they're supposed to be a go deer is
pretty close to a goat right go part of
the symbol depicts ambition resolute
intelligence curiosity but also
steadiness while the fish represents
passion spirituality intuition and
connection with the soul their colors
are dark green and dark blue a lot of
fun facts about Capricorn in case you
want to know I mean starting off with my
makeup I'm gonna do the same old boring
stuff that I usually do I've been trying
the Too Faced Proactiv nourishing
hangover replenishing face primer it's
got coconut water in it probiotic based
ingredients and skin revive errs and
then I'm just going to go about my
normal foundation routine which bare
minerals
bare Pro Foundation my current absolute
fave and sealer I'm going to be using
the Marcel flawless skin fusion
concealer
okay so to set everything I'm using my
Too Faced Born This Way after all
setting powder I've been using this one
for a while now - like I get like
anxiety with these ones we have to like
shake it to get the powder out because I
feel like my level of clumsiness just
does not get along with those types of
things if you've put two and two
together yet you may have realized that
Gregg being a Capricorn means that his
birthday is actually really soon and I'm
low-key very much stressing out about
what to get him have a few ideas and
there's a few like kind of more
sentimental things I was thinking of
making him but I need like a good gift
gift ideas because of any good ideas of
like gifts you can get your boyfriend
for his birthday like a ski pass and
like we could go skiing for the banks I
know what day he has off I was thinking
about just like taking him for dinner
but then I feel like I don't know like
my birthday this is when we were fresh
okay we were super fresh and on my
birthday last year he like gave me this
envelope and inside the envelope was a
piece of paper at Miami question mark so
he set the bar like you freaking set the
bar so high Iceland
yes or no chucky cheese yes or no I
don't know
I'm stressing it in the meantime I'm
gonna use the bareMinerals contour
palette this is something that I tried
out for the first time in my last get
ready with me and oh my god this is like
my pride and frigging joy this thing is
amazing I'm gonna use the highlight
color not none next I'm just gonna go as
per usual with my Amazonian clay in
taupe I'm actually running solo on this
in between when I'm talking to you guys
and what I'm actually doing the makeup
I've been playing up my new playlist but
this playlist just went live this week
it's called winter wonders I found some
like insanely good new music this week
it's very like indie pop you know
I think what I want to do since
capricorns are very like Lou I might go
into the two-faced glitter bomb and just
do like a pop of glitter just right
underneath the face like light and
earthy so I don't want to go too heavy
on the eyes I feel like I kind of want
to leave them a little bit more fairy
like splash underneath my eyes which is
this color here it's like a green blue
I'm gonna take a setting spray wet this
little pencil brush put the white just
underneath the very middle of my eyes
and then go over top of it with the
splash glitter okay so I accidentally
put a little bit too much mascara on but
that's okay roll with it next I'm going
to contour my face so I'm going back
into this contour palette and I'm gonna
use the blend color and the shade color
as well so like these two right here and
then I think I'm going to go back into
the blue like the aqua color that we
used is like the glitter underneath and
use that as a highlight to like a bit
more blue
this might totally destroy the whole
look but I just got an idea I'm gonna
try and take the blue like up here okay
Oh didn't turn out as bad as I thought
though I'm just gonna like I said use
that same blue color as a bit of a
highlight
he knows my cheekbones might be a little
too blue actually I'm gonna go over that
actually with the fairy dust in here too
just because I feel like the Blues a
little like it's clashing against my
complexion a tiny bit oh and then I
totally forgot to contour my nose so
though I'm actually really impressed
with how this turned out now I just need
to figure out what I want to put on my
lips I think I brought two options
I feel like this color could go oh this
might be the winner this is the French
nude by M cosmetics this was like my
favorite lip product for so long that
I'm super low on it
initially I was going to put lashes on
but I feel like honestly the mascara
mishap where I put on a little bit too
much low key not as high key all I did
to curl my hair today was use a curling
wand that's 2 inches and then I just
kind of brushed out the curls a little
bit this is new obsession of mine to
create like buns and horns and like just
things that take the bangs and pin them
up so that's kind of what we're gonna do
especially since capricorns are like the
goat I feel like we need to make some
sort of like horn or some sort of
ponytail I don't know we're gonna we're
gonna we're gonna come up with something
once I pull it tight I take a couple of
the pieces of hair towards like my baby
hairs in the front down and then I'm
going to cut it into three parts braid
it and then basically wrap it around
itself into a vine that's like a space
but on my head
in terms of with outfit again kind of
keeping with you know the blue theme I'm
just wearing this shirt I believe it's
from urban Planet the jacket is actually
a jacket that's gonna be coming out on
Co soon but it's basically this blue
corduroy with a little bit of like faux
white fur which the fur almost reminds
me of like a lamb which I don't know
anything related to a goat right now
unlike Kate that's Capricorn and then
I'm just wearing it with black jeans and
for boots I decided to use this as my
way of popping in the dark green of the
Capricorn little bits I'm wearing are
just from Urban Outfitters and they're
just like this dark green wanted this
outfit to be a very Capricorn inspired
but also make note of the fact that the
Capricorn is right in the dead center of
winter so it still has to be a winter
outfit you know aside from that I hope
you guys enjoyed it this little get
ready with me for a Capricorn inspired
look if you guys are a Capricorn leave
me a comment down below and tell me or
if you're not tell me what your sign is
down below and if you guys even like
care about astrology I don't know which
reminds me I haven't even read my
horoscope for the year yet that is
something I really should do I'm gonna
go do that now also I think my coffees
cold yeah it's really cold anything that
I used in this video I will link down
below including the playlist that I was
talking to you guys about that I
recently made and I also recently posted
