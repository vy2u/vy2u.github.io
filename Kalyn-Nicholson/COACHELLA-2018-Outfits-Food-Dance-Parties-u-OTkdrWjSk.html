channel for today I'm doing another
travel vlog with you guys we got we got
Christine hello Kristy I feel you
haven't been in one of my videos in so
long actually no since last summer when
we went to the beach you're right she
was in a vlog
basically yeah I'm still here today I
mean realistically it just in general
you are currently watching a Coachella
vlog we're not at Coachella right at the
moment obviously we just made it to Palm
Springs about an hour ago we hit the
flight this morning it's been a quite
it's been a great day so far we had some
wine on the plane we just changed it to
our butt pain nice and we're gonna go by
the pool and then go get some food at
the restaurant here it's like a Japanese
restaurant we heard good things right
they long story short we are here with
urban planet for Coachella today's
partly Thursday so Coachella isn't until
tomorrow so we kind of have a full
afternoon slash night to just hang by
the pool chill out I'm gonna get some
work done and then we're gonna go out
for dinner and then tomorrow we wake up
and the craziness begins it was cold and
rainy when we left Toronto and now look
it like just look at what I'm looking at
now like yes please so nestled on in get
comfortable grab a cup of joe and let
the Coachella flow begin it's cool
because I'm interested to see how this
Coachella is so different from last
year's Coachella if you guys watch that
vlog I'll pop it down below it's gonna
be fun and I'm with literally my
childhood best friends since we were
like 4 yeah we've known each other for
20 years huh that is actually kind of
gross and were that old two decades
we've been friends for two decades we've
been through all of the awkward phases
the greasy hair the when you wanted to
dive in there black let's listen to a
lot of good Charlotte good job and Simon
serenade
I did a lot of best friends like guy
best friends we did and now here we are
chillin 24 we'll hear about 24 and with
you even if you play me baby IQs
only question so you Milligan come so
why you slowing down
don't stop
going down
close enough
want to see what you my love about but
what's up it is now day one but I mean
technically day two but day one of
Coachella it's still early in the
morning we got up at like six because we
went to bed at like 9:30 yes so tired we
literally just crashed so we woke up
this morning ran downstairs and grab
some lattes which you guys just saw we
also just figured out our outfits for
later on so that we're not stressing
about a later and now we're gonna go
hang by the pool can I get some editing
done bask in the Sun for a few hours
which is probably not the smartest thing
to do before we go bask in the Sun at a
festival but Yolo yeah when you're
Canadian you take all the sudden you can
get kind of have no idea what to expect
there's a couple people today that we
want to see like kygo I think the
neighborhood may have been today or
tomorrow I can't remember today yeah
kygo the neighborhood things like that
so we'll probably want to go around like
- so we've got a few hours to kill it's
only 8:30 in the morning it feels like
it's like a lemon right probably cuz
we're in well that's the other thing two
or three hours behind and also we're
gonna film a video either today or
tomorrow which is gonna be super funny -
which will have already gone live before
this one so go check that out it's kind
of bland so far I'll keep you guys
posted on all the food and music and
outfit activities but aside from that
that's all I got for you I swear it will
get more interesting
I'm feeling what I'm feeling you even if
you play me baby IQ questions
