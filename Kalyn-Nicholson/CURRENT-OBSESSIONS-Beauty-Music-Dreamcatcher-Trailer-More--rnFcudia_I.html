too long ago I started making videos
called like my monthly obsessions and it
was basically like a favorites video but
I call it obsessions because it gets
called out to me quite a bit that when I
like something I obsess over it or I say
obsess over it whenever I'm like super
into a lot of things I'm just going to
make these videos to show you guys
without further ado let's jump into the
things that have been obsessing with
lately so I've been following this
Twitter called lady boners and it's
hilarious because it's just like a
rampage of just a bunch of really hot
guys so if you guys like looking at
aesthetically pleasing men then I will
leave a link to their Twitter down below
I'm not associated with them in any way
or anything I just love their Twitter
cuz you just get like all these videos
some pictures of just really
good-looking men there if you're
especially having a bad day lady boners
always flips that around with like a hot
picture of like Zac Efron or something
which speaking of Zac Efron something
else I'm obsessed with is this jiff like
can it get any better than that also I
have been super into wearing lip liners
lately and just like lipsticks but I've
been really into the nudes so I've been
using it the NYX lip liner and I think
it's just natural yeah it's just natural
I will put like a nude lipstick over top
if I just need a little bit more
moisture or whatever and the one by NYX
is cruelty free so if you guys are
looking for like a really nice nude lip
I'm wearing it on my lips right now this
is the lip liner I have been obsessed
with so yes also if you guys are
watching me for a long time you'll know
I really like journaling something I
recently came back to was my 5-year Q&amp;amp;A
chapters and ago given a lot of stores
like that I bought this in 2014 so I
have not been using it but two years
since 2014 and I could have had so much
of these filled oh and I'm a little bit
upset that I don't basically what it is
is every day you have it asks you a
question and you fill out what year it
is first and then you answer whatever it
says about the top like what time did
you wake up if you could explain in this
day or describe this day as an animal
what would you describe it as and just
like just fun stuff like that like did
you exercise today who's your best
friend at the moment so I think this
just be like a really cool way to see
how much I change over the next five
years
every time I'm having my morning coffee
I just quickly fill this out it takes me
like two seconds so you guys are looking
for something fun like this I
I recommend picking this up I think it's
a really really cool idea and I'm gonna
try my absolute best to stick to this
for five years another thing I recently
picked up our new sunglasses I've been
loving aviators lately and I keep
getting asked in like my snapchats and
all of that fun stuff like where my
sunglasses are from so these are the
first pair that I bought and they said
like my most worn ones and I don't know
if they have them on the side anymore
but I do have like a do prepare from
show PO and I'll leave it like to them
down below so this is like the polarized
pair that I got and these ones are like
blue but on the inside everything looks
purple which is just everything in life
should just be in a purple haze but yeah
so this is the second pair that I got
and I've been wearing these religiously
the only thing that I hate about
aviators is they're not the kinds that
like you can put in your hair like this
like I would do it but it honestly rips
my hair oh okay I have a few things to
show you guys from Victoria's Secret one
of the first things and if I can pick it
up right is this rock and body
perfecting cream kinda has like a little
bit of what's the word I'm looking for
says it's got luminous diamond powder
and high-tech diffusers for an illusion
of a flawless finish and I'm not lying
this stuff is amazing like blurs away
any sort of imperfections but I have
been tanning like every once in a while
so I like the look of this on top of my
skin it kind of gives it a bit of a
sheen and it smells really really good
so I don't know if you can get this on
like the Victoria Secret website or what
but you can find them outlets and I
don't have a price on it anymore I
apologize that I think it may have been
$18 which thinking back now is a little
bit expensive and staying on the top of
the Victoria's Secret I found a sports
bra sports bra that will change your
life I cannot talk today picked this up
a couple months ago and it's like the
front zipper clasp sports bra it's a
little bit more pricey but I wanted like
a nice sports bra but not only I could
wear for like yoga and running but when
I could wear just like kind of like
daily that doesn't give me a uniboob so
obsessed with the sports bra that just
recently like I picked up another one in
white I don't have an hourglass figure
so anything that gives me an hourglass
figure I'm obsessed with if you guys are
looking to invest in like a really
really good sports bra I highly
recommend picking up this one from
Victoria Secret you will not be upset if
you get this for its bro and then the
last thing I have to show you guys from
Victoria's Secret that I've been
obsessed with have been like my most
worn leggings
in the past two weeks than ever in my
entire life
these are amazing I've been wearing
these so much I'll put like a picture
right here like what they look like on
quality of these leggings is insane and
I've been wearing these to run outside
because it's been a little bit warmer up
here in Canada than usual for February
so I have been running outside again and
this actually just keeps me so warm like
I'm not cold at all it's a nice thicker
material if you are looking to invest
again in some really really good workout
or just like kind of lounge leggings I
highly recommend you guys pick these up
especially those of you that are living
in like the cold like I am because they
keep you really nice and warm so
obsessed and of course what would
obsessions be without the topic of music
lately I can't stop listening to country
I go through phases with country and I
think I've just been so excited for
summer that I've been listening to
country in a state of denial and telling
myself that it's summer I believe my
recent country playlist down below on
eight tracks the first song playing was
fired by Thomas Stratton Jordin Sparks
is it's been it's just been on repeat
like all the time on repeat most amazing
song whole playlist has a bunch of
really good songs so I will leave that
down below if you guys are into country
you'll like the playlist that also leads
me to the other song I've had on repeat
and it was totally unexpected and I
really didn't want to like it but pillow
talk by Zane it's a really good song and
I'm really mad because I wanted to not
like it so bad but it's just really
catchy and I like things that have a
really good solid beat also guys
literally I was up at 2:00 a.m. last
night ordering stuff for my new
apartment I'm so excited and so addicted
and I don't have that to show you guys
because I've just ordered it last night
and as much as I would like for it to be
here right now it's not here right now
but society6 if you guys don't know it's
like a website where a bunch of
different artists can upload their art
and sell them as items like pillows and
shower curtains and tapestries like the
one behind me and a bunch of other stuff
that's always where I find all of that
fun stuff that you guys always ask me
about is usually from society6 and no
I'm not being sponsored by them I
literally just love their site because
you can find stuff on there that's so
cool and unique and different that you
cannot find in stores I mean I've got
pillows like this from society sixth and
there's other ones hello it's from
society
and like the pink cloud tapestry that I
had with some society6 and this pillow
is from society6 there's just a whole
bunch of stuff coming so if you guys
want to see an apartment haul because
I've been buying a bunch of stuff at the
apartment that I'm moving into then just
thumbs up this video and when everything
gets here I can film a full hall if you
like that'd be really fun video just
like curl up with a coffee and just
watch somebody show you a bunch of
really stinking cute room decor or
apartment decor so if you guys want me
to film that just let me know and
another obsession of mine recently has
been the fire side candle from Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works I have been burning this
nightly so it's kind of weird if you
guys don't know already I am writing a
book called dreamcatcher and every night
that I write that book I burn this
candle because this is how I picture the
male character in the book smelling that
probably sounds so weird
anyway the fire it's like it's called
fireside it smells it's very woodsy it
smells like like the woods mixed with
like a crackling fire and you guys can
find fire sigh but bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
buy it you will not be upset if you're
someone that likes really like woodsy
smell I highly recommend this candle and
also if you guys just want to buy the
candle that smells like the male
character in my book then pick it up
because this is how I picture cayenne
smelling wench speaking of my book I'm
going to end this video on a really
really really really really really
really really fun note so if you guys
follow me on snapchat then you'll know I
finished the the trailer for my books to
kind of entice you guys and like draw
you in and kind of give you an overall
like vision or theme for the book or
idea of it so I'm not gonna rave about
it too much I'm just going to go ahead
and show you guys
so that is the trailer of my book I kind
of I went a little like crazy with it
really obsessed with editing that kind
of style of video and it's just not
something I get to like upload very
frequently obviously to my channel so I
had a lot of fun editing that and it
kind of looks like it's like super
intense and like a movie trailer but I
bet you it pulls you guys in so there
will be a whole blog post down below
with just the video trailer and I'll
leave that link down below along with
all of the other links of things that I
talked about today also don't forget to
tell me what you guys have been
obsessing over because I always am down
to obsess over new things somebody
pointed out a vegan ice cream to me on
Twitter the other day and I have been
hunting that down I need to find it
because it looks so good so other than
that I will see you guys all in a future
video and yeah happy obsessing on Mt is
that the kind of way to face the burning
heat I just think about my baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
