going to be doing a Canada Day video
hair outfits and some DIYs so getting
started I'm using my covergirl outlast
stay luminous foundation which I've told
you guys before is one of my favorites
but I just like how it kind of
illuminates my face and makes me look
nice and awake and then I'm just going
in with my covergirl and Olay CC
concealer and I really like this one
because it actually covers my dark
circles which is something that I hunt
for so this is been my newest favorite
concealer and then to set all of that in
place I'm going in with my Too Faced
pressed powder which I'm sure you guys
are not surprised about
and then for brows I'm just going in
with my aqua brow as per usual and for
this makeup tutorial those of you who
live in America this could very easily
work for you guys too and then I'm just
going in with my toothpaste chocolate
Soleil bronzer as an eyeshadow I want to
keep the eyeshadow nice and simple since
I'm doing a very bold lip and for
eyeliner I'm going in with my covergirl
intensify me which is super easy to put
on because it's kind of in a pen like
form and then they have a thin tip and a
thick tip so this has been my favorite
eyeliner for putting on when it comes to
liquid eyeliner since it is so easy to
control and you can make a really
dramatic wing and then to finish off the
eyes I'm just going in with my covergirl
super sizer mascara to contour my face
I'm going in with the chocolate Soleil
again by Too Faced and then that should
complete the whole contour and face
other than the lips
so before I go in with lipstick I'm just
going to line my lips with a red lip
liner and this one here is by Annabelle
and I'm just filling in my entire lips
with this before I go in with the
lipstick and speaking of lipstick I am
using my covergirl lipstick in 295
succulent cherry which has been my most
recent lately red lipstick and I really
like this because it's actually a lip
stain as well so it'll stay on your lips
all day or all night or whatever Canada
Day celebrations or maybe 4th of July
celebrations that you have planned and
this completes the makeup look so to
start out with some of the DIYs you're
just going to need a little mason jar
cup and I suggest spray-painting this
being the easiest way to go about it but
you could also hand paint it like this
but for the sake of the video I actually
picked up a red mason jar cup from the
dollar store as well but if you can't
find one I suggest painting one so this
is the little mason jar cup that I got
in red and then all I'm going to do is
take this matte paint here and it's
actually made for fabric but I decided
to use it on the glass jar instead and
I'm just drawing a little Canadian flag
in white it doesn't have to be perfect
by any means and then I'm just using
that the actual matte paint itself to
make cute little designs all over the
mug and you could even write your name
on this so that people know which drink
is yours you could get all fancy with
this but I decided to just do some fun
little designs
and if you're looking for a drink to go
inside for those of you who are legal
drinking age I like to make sangria so I
just put a little bit of red wine into a
pitcher and then I'm just going to add
some juice you could pick any juice that
you like but I prefer orange juice so
I'm just putting in a full thing of
orange juice as well as some sprite this
probably isn't the healthiest drink for
you but I mean it's Canada Day
celebration so you can have a little bit
more fun and it ends up being like a
darker red color and then I always like
to put in some fresh fruit as well so we
had some strawberries so add just threw
some strawberries in there and then you
just mix it all up and you're good to go
and don't worry if you are not the legal
drinking age because I also have another
drink recipe for you guys which is a
strawberry lemonade this is super easy
to make but one of my favorite summer
drinks to mix so I just put in some
lemonade but you could make your own I
just decided to a buy one since that
much easier and then I'm just gonna mix
it with a little bit of fruit punch this
sounds weird but when you mix the two
together it makes a really really nice
like rich strawberry fruity lemonade and
it's one of my favorite drinks for the
summer and it's super easy to make and
again I'm just putting a little bit of
fresh fruit in there and that is all you
need to make
as for outfits the first outfit I have
here is just a long red maxi skirt and
it is a chiffon with an underlining and
then the bossy a top is from Shoko so
I'll leave links to similar things that
I can find down below
and if you're looking to make an
accessory for the special day all you
have to do is get a little headband and
some red ribbon or whatever color your
country is and I'm just going to make a
little bow out of the ribbon here and
then hot glue it to the headband this is
a really really simple way to do a DIY
but it looks nice and festive in your
hair for the event and the outfit I
paired this headband with was by the
lookbook store and it's this adorable
red and white romper here so it has like
a nice open back and it's super cute and
festive and perfect for any kin of the
Day parties you might be going to
and as for the last outfit it is
probably one of the most casual so if
you're going to like a cottage or just
something a little bit more casual then
this is the outfit for you now the
shorts shrunk in the dryer so don't hate
but these shorts are by forever 21 and
the top is from Urban Outfitters and
it's just a nice comfy casual outfit for
kind of the day so that was it for my
makeup outfits and DIYs for Canada Day I
hope you guys enjoyed and let me know
down below which country you guys are
from bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
