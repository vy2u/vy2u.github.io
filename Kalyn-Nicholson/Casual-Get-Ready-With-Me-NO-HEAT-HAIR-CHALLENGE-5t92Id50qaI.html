drowned rat exactly what a lot of focus
on you've already had two coffees today
and so I feel like you know I shouldn't
make another one but I also want to be
consuming something as I get ready so
today I am filming I have a few videos
to film and some editing to do and just
like basically very like I'm basically
going for a very casual look today I
quite enjoy getting ready with you guys
what I'm putting on my lips it is the
drunk elephant lippy I actually just got
this like two days ago came in the mail
made out of mongongo nut oil avocado
seed oil and peptides it's cruelty free
you know where I was I hope you guys
haven't seen Bentley and what feels like
so long bearing one more pineapple into
another let us begin
I'm putting the Urban Decay all nighter
water proof long-wear liquid foundation
my conclusion is pretty much covered
every single imperfection I've had since
16 years old this might be my new like
go-to for what I don't have tanner I'm
not wearing any tanner today you see her
you can dogsy pineapple or jump on opal
eagle okay we're worried the next this
is another product I'm trying out for
the first time it is the YSL radiant
touch eye concealer in the color 2.5
which is vanilla making me think again
about coffee so conclusion on this is
feels it's one of those things that it's
giving me the perfect highlight without
being like thick and cakey because the
last that I was using I was doing this
exact thing where I probably put too
much on I know this guy's I am in no way
a makeup expert the last when I was
putting off would like crease all the
time it just was like almost too sick to
be used on your under eye or like even
on your eyelid and I like to use
concealer kind of was like an eyeshadow
primer to it literally soaks into my
skin he's passaic that was glorious the
trans translucent powder and set this
before we move on
guys this last pineapple going to be
using my Tarte Amazonian clay taupe
eyebrow filler it's a clay honestly I
don't know why I was just want to
explain the same old same old I'm so
used to getting ready with music on
lately I've been finding so much good
new music updated a lot of my playlists
just recently ever since I've been back
aside from watching girlboss I haven't
watched like any TV all I've done is had
music on speaking of TV one of the shows
that I actually recently caught up on
and watched the finale of is Riverdale
if you guys watch Riverdale please
comment down below I need to know I
don't know there's just something about
Jughead he's hold vibe I just I really I
really get with this I have this like
new obsession with how cool Cole Sprouse
is you know also back to my makeup I'm
just going in with my toothpaste natural
matte again since we're doing like a
casual look today I want to keep it nice
and simple I'm going to go in with honey
butter which is this color right here so
I'm now going in with chocolate cookie
and just kind of concentrating that on
the outer corner
and then just really quick I'm taking
heaven and then popping that just
underneath my brow and then my inner
tear duct so that kind of concludes my
go-to casual pretty much like this is
like my everyday go to like eyeshadow
look why am I putting more of this on I
don't know so now I'm going to go ahead
curl my lashes add a couple coats of
mascara and then move on to kind of like
the contouring my daily contract
hello hello Kaelyn this is an automated
call to let you know that a postal
service package has been received for
you that would be my Amazon Prime
package
god bless so this concludes my eyeballs
I've been trying to not wear lashes
lately because I started to like affect
like I was literally I was running off
of like three eyelashes left on my eyes
I've just been doing like two to three
coats of mascara to really like get
those lash like balloon fish but I'm in
the need of like a new cruelty mascara
so you guys know any of any good ones
look I'm using up right now I have like
four of these dogs they're the covergirl
super sizer kind of what I'm using up
until I can find a good cruelty free one
because they're already like I already
have them here that said like they're
really good at creating volume but it
flakes off like crazy if it gives you
the look but it is like half the
struggle because an hour later this
mascara is off your eyeballs so if you
guys know of any good cruelty free
mascara please comment down below save a
girl you know maybe girl that heartache
I'm so excited for the summer I mean I'm
more excited for fall it's like almost
less than 100 days until fall I'm sorry
don't hate me but fall is my favorite
season and also you Tober come on but
you know in the summer you want to be
able to make good memories with your
eyelashes staying on your face is that
so much to ask
No so check out all my Urban Decay
basquiat palettes the Basquiat Edition
it's like it's been special edition burn
your candles use your fine china life is
too short so even though it's a casual
day I'm going to go ahead and use this
palette so I'm going in with a really
really big fluffy brush
so I'm using the Too Faced milk
chocolate Soleil so and then I'm going
back into that same palette blush I've
been up really digging the purple in
this it's called no ho
I just find especially if you have blue
eyes it makes your eyes pop a lot but I
also maybe it's the spring /summer time
I don't know what it is but I just find
the purple is a lot less harsh than the
Pink's like this one here and I lightly
put a tiny bit of that nil ho on my
cheeks you're tending to know what I'm
talking about then I'm going to go over
it with this the highlight that's in
here it's called now's the time this one
right here freakin most incredibly
comparable to opal as much as I complain
about being a girl like the pimples on
my face the mother nature saying I also
love being a girl because painting your
face is just so fun like you get to kind
of like I know the makeup can get hated
on so hard sometimes but when will the
world understand that girls do not put
on makeup to like please people is it
weird that we hate on girls who are
wearing a lot of makeup but we don't
like we would never hate on a girl for
spending a lot of time on her hair we
never hit on a girl for like putting a
lot of thought into her outfit but the
minute you put too much thought into
your makeup you're like trying too hard
I just don't get that
I think it's art again I'm like the kind
of purply theme actually moon by Kylie
this has like a purple undertone to it
and again I just find it look so good
it's it's the perfect amount of color
but grunge and no I'm not putting a lip
liner on because as much as I could I'm
just way too lazy today
so I totally unintentionally went a
little overboard on over drawing my top
lip it just looks like ash mushed Jerre
all my fresh
so that's concludes my makeup and then
as for my hair I am actually trying to
go a week heat free yet so I'm trying to
embrace my my frizz embrace the curls
you guys want to join the challenge with
me please do maybe I'll make this the
thing on snapchat we can see how many
days we can we can go without heat and
to try and make it seem like I'm meant
to do this like messy hair don't care as
for my outfit today I'm just going to be
wearing this ACDC shirt that I picked up
when I was in Europe it's actually going
to be in my year Paul and then I just
tied it at the bottom to kind of like
not it a bit higher and since it's a
casual day I'm just rocking this shirt
with some leggings my absolute favorite
sneakers I'm going to leave links to all
of these things down below and then just
a jean jacket so frickin come see if you
could easily join a patio session
spur-of-the-moment or go and take your
jean jacket off and you're in like a
baggy tea and some leggings so it's like
a win-win situation you know so that is
it for my get ready with me chitchat I
hope you guys enjoyed let me know again
if you guys want me to continue filming
these it's fun to kind of do these
little chitchat I mean that I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I'll see you
