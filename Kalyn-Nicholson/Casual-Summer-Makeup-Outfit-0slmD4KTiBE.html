and if you look at me I know I'm gonna
break it baby yeah I hope you
one so to start off I'm using my born
this way foundation in the color sand on
just a damp Beauty Blender that I got
from forever 21 and for my brows I'm
going in with my NYX cake powder brow
bar a single chocolate bar by Too Faced
so I'm going in with milk chocolate must
be her favorite so goes the DJ destiny
place then I'm going in with triple
fudge I'm so excited to do fall makeup
tutorials burn fall candles and now it's
a little early to be saying since it's
still summer like fall is like my
favorite time to play around with like
makeup so for our lid color I'm going in
with salted caramel which sounds so
yummy
and then for my highlight color I'm
going in with white chocolate it's when
I could actually use a concealer brush
with us but I find it works out a bit of
semi-sweet into the crease just because
I feel like I don't know it seems really
choppy
or concealer I am going in with born
this way naturally radiant concealer in
the color light we should just go get
our nails done unfed chelated just buff
actually love this concealer so much I
like it cuz it's not too cakey and it's
not too oily it's like the perfect
in-between and then for pressed powder
I'm going in with my Too Faced primes
and poreless skin smoothing pressed
powders my ride-or-die right here I
believe is going to take a pencil brush
I'm gonna go back in with triple v line
my lower lash line every Tommy take
salted caramel put it right in I'm
looking for cruelty free eyeliner don't
hate me but right now I'm using the
Loreal carbon black linear intense but
if you guys have any recommendations for
a really good like cruelty-free vegan
eyeliner then let me know down below
because I'm on the husband
trying to stay away
take
Oh
and you curl my lashes and then apply
some better than sex
two-faced mascara which is like an
all-time favorite line
and while that first coat dries I am
going to go in with my two-faced dark
chocolate Soleil bronzer and start
contouring my face
and then to finish it off I'm going in
with the Marc Jacobs spotlight glow
stick for a highlight and really haven't
been doing blush lately I just feel like
some reason I find blush just doesn't
speak to my soul we found love in a
poison go danced and rain - yeah I'm
gonna you honeycomb by bite for my lip
color
keeping the math thing going oh one more
scene Smashbox photo finish primer water
it's probably just water very convenient
that they didn't miss the ingredients so
much water it's death for vitalizes
complexion to boost radiance
we preach
