Valentine's Day video I'm going to be
starting out with my L'Oreal True Match
and again I'm just adding these Stila
one-step bronzer just because I have a
bit more of a tan than I usually do and
I'm just blending this all into my face
with my Sigma kabuki brush and then I'm
going in over top of that with my
covergirl and Olay CC concealer and just
highlighting my face of this then with
my Annabelle CC transparent powder I'm
setting all of that into place with a
big fluffy brush that I got from
Claire's then moving on I'm going into
my love in Paris palette by mix and this
isn't hard Parisian chic and I'm just
using this taupe color and just adding a
bit more definition to my crease but
making it look nice and natural and then
on the outer corner I'm using a shimmery
chocolate hot chocolate color and just
blending that into the outer corner and
a bit into my crease as well and then
for a highlight I'm using this color by
hard candy in my inner tear duct and as
well as on my brows so I'm just going to
leave all of the products down below as
well if so for brows I'm going in with
my Makeup Forever aqua brow and ah this
is just actually a recent product that I
picked up that I'm loving
and since this is a more casual day time
or just if you're hanging out with your
friends kind of look I'm skipping
eyeliner and going straight to mascara
and again I'm using my L'Oreal miss
manga but I'm sure isn't a surprise and
I'm putting about two to three coats of
that on to contour my face I'm using my
NYX matte bronzer again not a surprise
it's another favorite of mine so I'm
just contouring out my cheekbones and
basically doing what I do as a contour
and highlight every other day of the
week
and for a nice Valentine's pinkie glow
I'm putting this NYX cream blush on and
it is in the color Lotus I believe or
pink Lotus and just blending it in with
my fingers and no it did not make my
makeup any extra cakey I promise so then
I'm going in with my n about lip liner
and I'm just lining my lips because I
wanted to do a red lip for Valentine's
Day now this is especially good if
you're doing a more casual Valentine's
Day look I find if you go with red lips
you can wear still a pretty casual
outfit and pretty casual makeup but the
red lips really play up the Valentine's
Day look so then I'm going over in Mike
with my covergirl succulent cherry
lipstick and this is a new favorite of
mine as well
so now that the makeup is done moving on
to hair I'm actually going to rock my
natural hair for this look and I'm just
going to add some Pantene daily
treatment in it and this is going to
help make it more shiny and just more
texturized and such and make it so that
it's not too frizzy or anything and then
I'm just gonna throw a hat over top this
is good because you're not using heat on
your hair obviously and it's just a
simple messy cute look and this hat is
actually from forever 21 and then as for
my casual Valentine's Day outfit my
heart belongs to coffee t-shirt is from
forever 21 it's actually a pajama shirt
but I love it cuz it's an oversized
white tee and then I'm wearing a
cardigan some leggings and some little
black booties and I'll leave either
similar products or the actual ones down
below so I hope you guys enjoyed this
casual Valentine's Day look I hope you
guys all have an amazing Valentine's Day
and I'll see you in a future video my
next mistake
wanna play money student</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
