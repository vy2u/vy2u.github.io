high high alert
hi al of high love with you on my love
open up on my love you give me truth
honest love honest of all this of for
you
good morning guys and welcome back to my
channel I'm doing another vlog how is
your Sunday going if you're watching
this on Sunday and if you're not how's
your day going it is actually Friday
September Friday September 25th I just
woke up it's about 8 o'clock in the
morning I woke up like a half an hour
ago I didn't get to sleep till pretty
late last night so I didn't really set
an alarm this morning I just kind of let
my body wake up when it wanted to I've
been waking up at like 6 a.m. every
other day this week and I was like I
need a break
I'm just kind of taking a gander at my
schedule for the day checking out all
the things that I need to do today I'm
gonna be heading out - I think Walmart
and home scents because I want to do
some recent partly for a video but I'm
gonna vlog the behind the scenes if you
guys so starting off there's a few
things I want to get done before I even
get ready today and that is I want to
wash my bedding because it's been a few
weeks so I definitely want to wash my
bedding I want to get a workout in I
think I'm just gonna go down into the
gym in my building and hit the
elliptical for a quick thirty minutes
just because they don't have that much
time today and then shower and get ready
so without further ado grab yourself a
good old mug of the good stuff let's get
to it
the roll
so visually finished getting ready I
feel like this is bad lighting I am a
movie guys that's much better so I just
finished getting ready I'm going to get
some work done on my computer I have
some emails to answer and I also need to
write up some videos that I'm filming
today look up some info because as I
mentioned already in this vlog I'm going
to be heading to a HomeSense and to
Walmart to get some stuff for my
apartment I've been slowly kind of
redecorating the whole thing and as part
of the video that I'm filming today I
need to like switch things up and also
just in general like I've been wanting
to so I kind of incorporated it into a
video for that reason so I need to look
up some inspo answer some emails do the
video write-ups and eat this glorious
bagel that's going to put my workout to
shame I was craving a bagel so Bon
Appetit shouldn't everything bagel with
vegan butter so I'm freaking good
it's Friday but I'm praying to God that
traffic's not too bad and that Walmart
it's not too crazy but it's Toronto it's
always bad and it's always crazy so
she would mind
good morning guys so it is now Saturday
morning it is the 26th I'm actually
running out the door right now because I
woke up a little late and I have a lash
appointment today so I've decided that I
wanted to get lash extensions and
there's this place it's like a decent
walk from my apartment that had really
good reviews online and I don't know
I've been kind of dabbling with the idea
for a while now so I figured I'm just
gonna go ahead and try them I'm gonna
run really quick grab a latte and throw
my headphones on and walk to this place
forget what it's called but I will post
it or vlog it or whatever guess I'll do
a little bit of a before and after these
are my lashes prior to going I mean
I'll update you guys more after this
clip because I'm running late but yeah
it's kind of where I'm at right now it's
918 my appointments at 10:00 but I want
to go to Starbucks and I want to walk
there and it's like a half hour walk so
I literally need to leave right now
I can't carry it away I live in too fast
and enough sleep until II okay so I'm
officially back I just got my lashes
done I'm like I haven't gotten a good
chance to really look at them I mean
they already look decently different on
camera I'll show you guys a zoomed-in
after if I can I'll try and put them
side-by-side to show you guys what they
look like before but after she finished
I went to go to the bathroom really
quick and I was looking in the mirror
and I was like for 200 bucks
that's this is the difference but
actually now that I'm back and I'm
seeing it on camera I actually do think
that they look a lot different I don't
know let me know what you guys think I
just I've always wanted to get them done
the amount of actual strip lashes I
could have bought in for 200 bucks is so
much the only better thing about these
is that when you're not wearing makeup
it just like makes a difference and
they're on all the time you don't have
to apply or eat or like whatever we'll
see how this goes I'm gonna keep you
guys posted in my vlogs over the next
few weeks on how well they stay in and
like all of that good stuff and then
from there I think I'll make a decision
on if I'll keep getting them filled I
will be your guys's test dummy if you
don't know if you want to get lash
extensions now that I'm back I have to
film a few more clips for the video that
I filmed yesterday I moved my desk in
here which I'm actually really diggin
but there's a few decor pieces that need
to change up and I need to change my
bedding as well you guys haven't seen
the video already it should have already
gone live by now I'll pop it up on the
screen right here but I'm basically
going to change my bedding change around
some pillows and things like that and
just spruce up my apartment a little bit
and then after that I need to go to the
grocery store and grab some ingredients
because tomorrow is Greg's little baby
nephews birthday it's his first birthday
and we're going and I want to make him
little like confetti like fun cute
little happy first birthday cupcakes so
it's gonna be a relatively chill
Saturday and then I'm not too sure what
I'm doing today maybe socialize since I
had such a chill night last night I
haven't had a night like last night in
so long and it was so needed or I just
kind of hung up with myself and comfy
clothes and like hung out on my laptop
watched a lot of Gilmore Girls watched
some stranger things and just like just
chilled I had candles burning it was
just like the coziest chillest night and
I haven't done that in so long I've been
working like freaking crazy so that was
what my night consisted of and it was
perfect but tonight I'm kind of feeling
the need to get out and socialize I'll
keep you guys posted and get to making
some cupcakes
lbc recipe for the cupcakes that I make
down below God's good to us in those
vacant spaces it wasn't awful we were
torn apart and now we
hey guys what's up so it is actually now
Tuesday August 29th I didn't blow up the
last I don't even know the last time
I've logged with you guys I think it was
making cupcakes on Sunday I went to
Greg's nephews little birthdays little
first birthday and brought those
cupcakes and then we watched the VMAs
that night and then yesterday I honestly
just worked and I realized that this
vlog was probably not long enough so I'm
tying you guys in two further on in the
week my place is an absolute mess right
now
IKEA actually just delivered my new
couch so there's just like boxes like it
doesn't look that bad until you walk
over here like there's just boxes all
over my living room right now and then
in a few hours Greg's coming with one of
his buddies Shalev and they're going to
take my old couch and deliver it to the
girl that bought it off Kijiji I don't
even know exactly like honestly how
we're gonna get this couch out of here
like with all of this stuff around it's
gonna be a struggle and I also didn't
actually necessarily book you know the
moving elevator so we're gonna have to
be super sneaky about it it should be
interesting I decided to get rid of this
couch guys this was like my first-ever
big-girl purchase when I moved into my
last apartment like this couch has done
wonders we've had some good times
there's none on the river Hana boat he
calls his own his life is constant
motion
he says the waterside says the man never
it just it's just way too big it's time
to see it go it's time to you know get
my second official couch in life I got
way too sentimental over things but my
living room is gonna seem so much bigger
with this new couch it's basically
because we're wondering what Coach I got
I'll show it to you guys cuz I'm gonna
have to build it today but it's
basically the same couch like the same
design it's in a dark gray though and
instead of the L shape like where it
connects and goes to an L there's just a
chaise lounge here which is gonna get
rid of like this whole wall and extra
arm and just open up the whole living
room and make it so much bigger so
that's kind of the plan for today and I
have a bunch of editing to do from now
until then I was supposed to go to
Starbucks to edit but just because I
want to stick around for whatever
they're gonna be able to come and
deliver the couch I think I'm just gonna
have to stay here for the day and I have
enough coffee to to last me today so I
also got this new mirror so I think
while I wait I might just open this up
and put it I think I'm gonna put it over
in that far far corner over there so I
think that's what I'm gonna do right now
okay Greg just called me and he was like
good news and bad news bad news is
irrelevant it's about a future trip that
we're trying to book but the good news I
was supposed to head over to Greg's
anyways tonight for a barbecue and he
was like bring a concert outfit because
we're gonna go see John Mayer tonight I
could not think of a better way to end
this blog so I'm literally speeding to
get ready I have to leave here in 30
minutes
I was not concert ready
let's do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
