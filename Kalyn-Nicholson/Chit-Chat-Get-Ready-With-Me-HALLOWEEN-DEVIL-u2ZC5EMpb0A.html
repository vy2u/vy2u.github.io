channel today is the 30th day of you
Tober holy shiznit we did it there's
still gonna be a video tomorrow but
today like it's a vlog so I just feel
like today is like the official official
last like intro like this and do you
know what I'm saying I don't know for
today's video I'm going to be doing a
devil inspired get ready with me ever
since I did the Wednesday Addams
inspired get ready with me I feel like I
don't know why I'm really digging like
inspiring my outfits and makeup after
like a certain theme a kay Wednesday
Addams or Devils and making it so that
like okay if I pop these ears off and
maybe take the pigtails out I could
actually I could actually go out like
this I think that's the part of
Halloween I'm going to miss most is that
it's like socially acceptable to play
dress-up aside from that if you guys
want to see my devil inspired makeup
hair and outfit then just keep watching
oh my god my hair is such a hot mess
right now hopefully we'll be able to
tame this today okay first things first
headband today I'm gonna pop my hair
into a ponytail too just so it doesn't
get in my way okay first things first
I'm gonna go in and mix these two
foundations these are like my two go to
my two favorite I'm currently kind of in
the middle of the two of them I'm not
this tan and I'm not this light so I
feel like mixing them together kind of
creates the exact skin that I currently
have I ran out of tanner this week which
is like the worst possible case scenario
because I'm supposed to go to Mexico and
my skin is going to be quite ghostly
which is kind of fit in I mean
considering television I'm also unlike
the last few pages of Harry Potter and
it's making me sad because I think I'm
gonna take a break from the series after
this book even though like I don't want
to but I also do want to like I want to
prolong reading them but I also really
want to read unfiltered on my vacation
so it's like a bittersweet feeling
wouldn't
to the end of the Harry Potter book okay
so I'm just mixing these together and
then I'm going to
so I'm using my Coastal Scents 88 color
eyeshadow palette I literally bought
this I feel like maybe five years ago I
don't know if that's gross I should
probably throw it out I don't know
makeup even supposed to last that long
but I'm using it because it has red
colors in it and so I'm gonna be playing
around with these Reds on my eyes I
don't really fully know what I'm doing
I'm gonna kind of make it up as I go
let's see what kind of devilish makeup
we can come up with
so now gonna add one more coat of
mascara before throwing on some lashes
I'm like I'm decently decently happy
with how it turned out I ended up using
like a shimmery red eyeshadow to do a
highlight instead of a normal highlight
I didn't really love it on my nose you
know actually I'm gonna go into my Urban
Decay bestia I don't even know if I said
that right I'm gonna use this actually
on the tip of my nose but for my
cheekbones I'd kind of like I kind of
like the red I dig it you know what even
just putting this over top of the red it
looks kind of also this brush is not
meant for your face but I also really
needed near my moustache hey Siri remind
me to near my moustache okay you rock
don't ever change
I'm not sure I understand I'm not sure I
do either
turned out actually a lot better than I
anticipated I'm gonna go back into the
shimmer palette and use the same red
that I used on my cheeks to just touch
up the inner corner of my eyes and then
I think we'll move right on to hair and
outfit because I actually have such a
sick outfit picked out today
so that is it for Mike get ready with me
I hope you guys enjoyed if you guys
decide to recreate this double up for
Halloween definitely be sure to tag me
so I can check it out and other than
that I will see you guys all in toros
see you tober videos the last one
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
