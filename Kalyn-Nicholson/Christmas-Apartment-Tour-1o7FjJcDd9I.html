walk into my apartment I have my wreath
on the door that I made in a video last
year and I'll link it somewhere down
below and then just off to the side
where you first walk in I have this
doormat from society6 with a bunch of
shoes on there and then this thing
honestly this has been in every single
one of my tours this year but yeah it's
just from Walmart it hangs um my jacket
like Bentley's leash hats purses more
everyday things sunglasses keys I also
have this table here this isn't going to
stay here but I just didn't really have
anywhere else to put it
right behind my couch here I have this
like ottoman it's from HomeSense and
inside I just keep a bunch of blankets
and then over here off to the side I
just have this little book case and it
is also from Walmart um the lamp again
from Walmart I have my popcorn machine
from my dad I have a warm tobacco-pipe
candle and then in all of the cubicles
are just little like mementos so next to
that area is my living room and then the
couch as always is from Ikea we have a
little mini Bentley taking a grand old
nap with Olly his elephant on the couch
all of my pillows aside from the furry
one right here and the bread plaid one
are from society6 if I can find links
I'll leave them all down below I have
like a marble one with like this log
pillow this red plaid blanket which is
from indigo chapters Bentley is
currently sleeping under here we go
buddy those two are from society6 this
one is from chapters as well that pillow
is from HomeSense my little elf it was
from my Nana she gave me that for
Christmas last year and then this pillow
is also from society6 as well as that
one and the little fur throw is from
home cents and then like always above my
couch I just have my New York tapestry
with these little like it's like birch
wood almost that I got from indigo or
chapters and they light up and then on
the nightstand just beside my couch I
have my lamp which is from Target I have
these two candlestick holders with the
candles 5 o'clock shadow and station 22
those are both from home sense and the
candlestick holders are from Walmart and
then underneath we have Bentley's joy
box and of course how can we forget the
Christmas tree which is right beside
there I ended up moving it over here so
you can see it through the window my
Christmas tree is from aronia but all
the lights burned out which if you got
stopped my blog you probably saw me
having to put all these new lights on it
and the color scheme of it is like red
black silver and white so that is mine
and Bentley's Christmas tree and then
off to the left here is just this TV
stand it actually came with my apartment
the fireplace part of it doesn't work
because I can't find the remote I
haven't been able to find the remote
since I've moved in but it still does
the job I have my xbox on there I'm
realizing I really need to dust
I have Bentley stalking and my stacking
and this is malt cider from Bath Ben
body works and then of course just my TV
and then my Eiffel Tower and then we
have my gallery wall which I made in a
summer morning routine I'll link it on
the screen if you guys haven't seen it
yet and then this full-length mirror is
from yes core JISC however you want to
call it and then my rug is from Ikea as
well as my coffee table and on top of
there I just have this like red Taylor
Swift book that I got from indigo and
then a tobacco and oak candle so coming
back out of my living room right here I
just have the Brooklyn Bridge that I got
from Walmart quite a few years ago with
wire lighting around it and then I have
a rug from society6 with my bar stool
and tables and then I just keep my
MacBook up here and I have this candle
here which is also from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and then over here is just my
kitchen the same old kitchen you guys
are used to seeing obviously forgot to
shut the cupboard after making coffee
the only thing those were really changed
is on my fridge I put these photos from
when I went to LA and got to go see like
my network studio and they have like a
photo booth there so we all got got a
bunch of pictures you guys know Katie my
kitchen is like nothing's really changed
I have a bunch of really spotty bananas
for baking but
yeah it's kind of pretty much the exact
same except for oh yeah over here I have
this little hit me with your best pot
coffee press which i think is so cute
and then of course my fridge which is
I'm on my last day of meal prep coming
through the hallway you can see me in
the bathroom mirror what's up in the
first room obviously this is still my
Beauty room I have like a door hook on
the door that has a bunch of like robes
and hats and things like that same as
last time but everything else in here
will not everything but a big chunk of
it has changed so first things first on
the wall I just have my dry erase which
I'm not going to show you guys because
it has all my future videos on there and
then when you first walk in I'll give
you guys like a full overview of the
whole room okay so first things first
this is where I tend to keep my slippers
except I'm wearing a pair right now but
I keep them just in front of this mirror
here pretty sure this was the exact
outfit I was wearing in my last
apartment tour I'm and then I just have
my closet which I normally keep shut
actually if you guys want me to go into
full detail on how I organize my closet
room or beauty room let me know I can do
a winter version have my IKEA drawers
here that has like DIY stuff and makeup
and then on top I have my mahogany
balsam and this little light-up tree
which is from indigo all of my favorite
perfumes and then a bunch of lipsticks
in the background and my little pink
Victoria Secret dog and then as always I
have my giant IKEA closet sectional on
top I just keep my purses and that
everything's kind of color-coordinated I
really need to reorganize all of this
though got like Burgundy's and blacks
then we've got like running shoes and
sneakers and then we've got like tans
and topes
this bookshelf is mostly just high heels
and then on top are the little letters
that light up that I got from when I
went to the Toronto Film Festival and
then off to the side here I have this
little nightstand forint in season this
is like my winter slash fall suitcase
and then pillows that have been squished
probably from Bentley and then just
beside the chair here I have my like
weights and my medicine ball for when I
do my
at home circuit training another one of
these little bookshelf things that again
I haven't fully filled out yet the very
very top part that was the same I have
all my old vintage cameras which I'm
obsessed with and just above that I have
this little hanging thing from Ikea and
I have my mini Polaroid dream board up
here which I'm actually going to print
out more and fill out the rest and then
my string lights which I got from Urban
Outfitters and then of course we have my
computer I keep this little like marble
think I like hackers can get into your
camera and stuff I don't know does
anyone else do this or am I just super
weird and then my keyboard I have my
crystal that changes color my mouse my
little marble post-it notes that I got
off at sea and down the floor beside my
feet is Bentley's igloo because if I'm
not holding him he needs to be like by
my feet or by me so I always keep like a
dog bed in every single room so next
things next let's move into my bedroom
so this is what you first see when you
look in a changed it around again for
those of you guys that didn't see my
vlog so I'll start over on this side
first things first another dog bed I
have my nightstand here which is also
from gist or yet and then I just have my
society6 tapestry which all of you guys
tend to ask about it's in the size large
and I just got this one that has like
snowy trees for the winter I'm obsessed
with the way it turned out my bed which
is also from JISC it's got the matching
drawers underneath which came with my
bed my bedding is from HomeSense this
heated blanket is an early Christmas
present I got Bentley because it gets so
cold in the winter he's obsessed with
this thing he gets mad when I use it all
of my pillows are from okay so these two
are from society6 and those two are from
indigo or chapters and then I have my
dreamcatcher and I strung the same Urban
Outfitters lights all around my window I
have another one of these bookshelves
off to the side here is like my
breakfast tray or my bed tray my records
a picture of my Nana and Papa when they
were super young they were like 16 all
of my books and journals those are like
my journals from the day I started
journaling to my journal right now it's
kind of funny it's so fun to go back and
read from like way long ago like four or
five six
years ago and then on top I just have my
record player and then this little plant
guy which is also from indigo / chapters
that lights my fireplace which it is way
too hot for that to be on I know but my
fireplace which is from Rona and on top
of there I just keep my TV and then off
to the side I have my guitar which has a
little Santa hat on him right now and
then my like beauty / vanity desk so
sometimes I'll bring my laptop in here
if I want to do work in here instead of
like out on the kitchen table so I have
like all of my brushes and like my
headband there and then the mirror is in
my closet I'll just pull it out do my
makeup and then tuck it back away so
it's like not out in the open with like
this fake fur throw on it and this lamp
which is also my obsession and it comes
with like a little like a place to plug
stuff in as well as a USB so this is
what I used to charge my phone and then
last but not least of course we have to
top it off with a candle so I have my
fireside and this completes the cycle
that is my room so walking back out of
my room last but not least I have this
storage room here which is super super
messy it just has a bunch of my filming
lights and like tripods and stuff and
then in here it's just my bathroom which
again guys like literally nothing has
changed nothing's changed at all though
my favorite part about this though I
don't know if you guys remember this
from like my very first apartment tour
in this apartment is when you pull this
me row and like do your hair and stuff
you can see the back of your head and
you can also see like your outfit from
all angles it's just super convenient
so that completes my holiday apartment
tour I hope you guys enjoyed seeing all
the little changes I made for the
Christmas time and other than that I
will see you guys all in my next video
bye guys to say always teen in my way
blow away to face but in my heart I
understand I made my move and it was all
about you I feel so far removed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
