countdown this is going to be day three
and I am doing a Christmas tag where I'm
going to answer a bunch of fun Christmas
questions I'm also going to leave them
all in the downbar below so you guys can
go in the comments section and write
your answers down below to say I can
repeat them sorry for this I am filming
this last second because I was
originally going to film another video
but I lost the footage so I'm not
looking so so hot right now but we're
gonna go with it so I'm just gonna jump
I'm gonna jump right in I have all the
questions here on my iPad and I'm just
going to start answering the number one
what is your favorite Christmas film my
favorite Christmas movies have to be
between the Grinch and elf I can't
choose it are those two ago the Grinch
is such a classic but elf is so funny
and always makes me laugh so it's out of
those two - have you ever had a white
Christmas so I actually live in Canada
so usually about 70% of our Christmases
are white Christmases so I'm quite
blessed for that reason okay question
number four is what is your favorite
Christmas song I feel like it all
depends if we're talking like a Newark
Christmas song I'm going to say I'm
really liking Santa tell me by Ariana
Grande but if we're talking like a good
old classic Christmas song it's probably
baby it's cold outside by anybody I like
any version of that song it's just I
don't know what it is about that song I
think it is the fact that it just sounds
like such a cozy little song question
number five do you open presents on
Christmas or Christmas Eve I open
presents usually Christmas Day with my
family but Ryan and I are doing our
presents together Christmas Eve so I
have the luxury of both number six can
you name all of Santa's reindeer Dasher
dancer Prancer vixen comet Cupid Donner
Blitzen and Rudolph I have this weird
pet peeve where when people forget what
Rudolph that were like really bothers me
I don't know
number seven what holiday traditions are
you looking forward to most is your do
you mind I think about holiday
traditions and I'm looking forward to
most is every morning of my sister and I
and my mom when we wake up we make
really cool like really fancy coffees
and hang out and obviously so that one
and obviously I'm doing like Christmas
party with my friends which we did one
last year so I'm looking forward to that
Christmas tradition and I'm also looking
forward to the tradition that we started
last year to Ryan and I where we open up
Christmas presents on Christmas Eve like
our cousins to each other so those are
three traditions I'm looking forward to
question number eight is your Christmas
tree real or fake our Christmas tree is
fake both at our apartment and at my
mom's house question number nine what is
your all-time favorite holiday food
slash sweet treat my favorite holiday
food is probably like stuffing but
sounds weird but like at Christmas
dinner stuffing is the thing I look
forward to the most
and my favorite holiday treat are either
Christmas cookies or hot chocolate
because I have an obsession with hot
chocolate during the holiday time number
ten
be honest do you like giving gifts or
receiving gifts better I just love the
look on people's faces when they open up
the gifts that they got from you I don't
know it's just a weird it's just as a
weird thing to enjoy watching somebody
get excited over the stuff you bought
them so I have to genuinely say I much
rather prefer giving gifts especially
since there's not a lot of stuff that I
can heat so when I was younger I
definitely enjoy receiving gifts better
question number 11 what is the best
Christmas gift you have ever received
oh that's Tuffy I would have to narrow
it down to two and one of them would be
my guitar um I have this really really
nice guitar that I got I think it was
two or three years ago that exact same
year my Nana Papa had also bought my
sister and I tickets to Taylor Swift and
we were like seven rows from the stage
so out of those two I can't even tell
you because those were both amazing
gifts special number 12 is what would be
your dream place to visit during the
holiday season
and for me I think it'd be New York just
because I'd like to see like the big
tree the Rockefeller tree and those
skating and see the ball drop on Year's
Eve and I just ride New York be such a
pretty place during the holidays number
thirteen are you a pro rapper or do you
fail miserably and I'm actually a really
good at wrapping presents but I hate
doing it number fourteen what's your
most memorable holiday moment one of my
most memorable holiday moments and this
is gonna be weird it's Christmas Eve I
couldn't even tell you what year it was
or what age I was all I know is I was
really young and we had gone over to my
parents friend's house to go Christmas
caroling and then there was like little
appetizers and snacks and like a little
Christmas Eve party afterwards and on
the drive home my dad turned up the
radio because the guy in the radio said
that there was like a Santa Tracker and
then we're tracking Santa over I think
it was Australia or something at the
time it was something random but he was
they were tracking him and I just
remember the whole rest of the ride home
because it was like a 20-minute ride
home
I literally stared out the window like
convinced I was gonna see Santa question
number 15 what made you realize the
truth about Santa what truth about Santa
question number 16 Danny make new year's
resolutions and do you stick to them I
normally do make New Year's resolutions
but the amount of times I've stick to
them is probably zero that's a lot the
year I went vegetarian it was grade
seven and I made the New Year's
resolution to go vegetarian and I'm here
now whoever who even knows how many
years later like eight years later and
still going strong it's like nine years
later nine years later and I'm still
going strong so I did stick to that New
Year's resolution question number 17
what makes the holidays so special for
you amazing so holla guys holiday so
special for me is that it's just such a
happy time of year and all your family
gets to get together and you can go look
at Christmas lights and it's like a
romantic time of year and you can have
like Christmas dates where you drink hot
chocolate and you go skating and you
hang out with your friends and you get
baked and you get to find people
presents and there's just so much
happiness and coziness with like
fireplaces and
this movies and all of that stuff and
just spending time with like the people
in your life that means most to you I
think that's what makes the holidays so
special for me is that there's just so
much happiness going around that it's
hard to be like upset during the
holidays see that and being able to see
all of your family and your friends and
your loved ones say yes if that makes
the holiday so special for me so that's
all the questions that aren't for this
Christmas tag I hope you guys enjoyed
this quick little video for day three
I've got lots and lots of videos planned
I planned them all out now from today
all the way until Christmas so there's
going to be lots of really cool and
really fun stuff coming your guys way
um so other than that I will leave all
the questions down below so you guys can
go and answer them yourselves I also put
up a new blog post last night and I'm
