much when I was gone hey guys so for
today's video I'm going to be filming a
haul for you guys I have two different
hauls that I'm going to be filming today
that I'll be going out in two different
videos just because there are two
different themes I feel like I just had
two different so many times so at the
end of summer coming up people are
starting to do back-to-school things and
you know shopping for school work
college whatever it is and I am NOT
going to school but I do love the whole
back-to-school season it's probably my
favorite time of year because the nights
just start to get a little bit cooler
but it's still nice and warm and hot
during the days and I don't know like
end of August early September is
probably around my favorite time of year
because I know fall is coming up and
follows my favorite season but it's also
still enjoying like the tail end of
summer so I know this is a really long
intro you're probably like oh my gosh
she's had way too much coffee today but
I'm just really really happy and I don't
know I just I feel really good so yeah
I'm just gonna start showing you guys
this stuff I have in this haul because
otherwise I'm just gonna end up rambling
on and this is just gonna be like a life
update that you guys don't need right
now so as most of you guys already know
I was just recently in British Columbia
Alberta with my family and it was an
amazing trip and I'm going to show you
guys some stuff from that as well as
some stuff that I had recently gotten
online and yeah I'm just gonna jump in
this intro is just way too long so first
things first I went to a store called
sirens and that I believe is a Canadian
store but it's also the same brand as
like urban planet and sirens and Blue
Notes like all of those are kind of
owned by the same company so you can
probably find these types of things in
any of those stores and I'll try and
find links to similar items down below
but this was the first thing I picked up
it's just this little plaid tank top and
I'm obsessed with this so this was only
13 dollars and it's just blue like navy
blue burgundy and red just a typical
plaid shirt and I thought this would be
really cute with just fall coming up and
it's going to be an a back-to-school
video coming soon
tint so you will see this shirt in
action soon but that is the little tank
top icon it's just like a flowy
spaghetti straps the next thing I got
from sirens was also $13 and it's just
this black maxi skirt it's gonna be hard
for me to show you guys exactly what it
looks like on camera but if you guys can
tell it has some cinching right here so
it makes you look a little bit more
curvy well especially for me it makes me
look more curvy than I actually am so it
gives me a little bit more shape around
my hips and my bum and that is what it
looks like and then right after the
cinching ends there's like a like I'd
like like a slit in the skirt so your
leg kind of shows anyway it's just it's
really a like cute kind of sexy but
still it's a maxi skirt so if you don't
like to show a lot of skin this is like
a good way to go and the top that I got
was on the sale rack for actually five
dollars Kyra picked it up for me my
sister she saw it she was like but this
is what it looks like it's just a royal
royal blue and I've been obsessed with
this color lately and it is a bit of a
booby shirt if you can't tell but
sometimes you just need to have a couple
of these types of tops in your closet
and it hits a long sleeve and cropped
and it just has this like black mesh
detailing on the bottom so we also went
to a blue notes and one of the things I
picked up there was this scarf and it
was between this and a dark blue plaid
scarf and I picked up this one because I
figured I could find a blue a blue plaid
scarf pretty much anywhere but this one
had giraffes on it and I was like yes
drafts but yeah so it's just navy blue
and it has like brown and beige colored
giraffes all over it and it was just it
was just too epic for me to not grab and
I actually picked it up to go with this
dress that I got and it's sort of like a
t-shirt style dress except it's
long-sleeved and this is also for blue
notes I believe this was $10 and it's
just a normal black long-sleeve dress
and it's just that t-shirt material
which is so comfy like how did I not
have t-shirt dresses before like I think
I got my first t-shirt dress like a
month or two ago and I was like where
have you been all my life you can kind
of like just t-shirts style dresses up
or you can dress them down more casual
so the
so you're going to be seeing a lot of
like t-shirt style dresses in tons of
videos coming soon so then from forever
21 I picked up this little off the
shoulder dress here and I have like a an
outfit put together in my mind for it
and it's gonna be in a video coming soon
but it's this little black and white
striped and this is like off the
shoulder like hangs just off of your
shoulders just a tiny bit and it's just
striped and it's got t-shirt it's like a
t-shirt length and then it flares out in
the bottom and it's just black and white
and it's super cute and the heels that I
got to go with this dress is what's
going to make this outfit they're like
this purpley magenta color and I just
figured with the black and white stripes
like that just and I just like yes yes
that is the black and white dress I got
from forever 21 in the shoes so I also
recently picked up some things from the
lookbook store and I'll leave the links
to them down below but the first thing I
picked up was this dress here it's like
a tie-dye blueish style dress which you
guys know I'm obsessed with so it's like
this bluish Navy tie-dye sort of color
and then it has white mandala elephants
all over it
like can we just take a second for how
perfect this dress is okay so this is
what it looks like and it's got the
elephant mandalas and then it's just got
some cool white like Aztec detailing on
the bottom and then next I picked up
this two-piece from the book store and
this is what the bottoms look like
they're like a navy with purple flowers
on them and then the talk is just this
halter style crop top here and it is a
two-piece and sticking with the
two-piece theme I also picked up this
two-piece here like this print as you
can see I have an obsession with like
galaxy weird like new tie-dye
like just colorful everything and I saw
this and I was like I need you in my
life so this is the two-piece those are
the shorts for it and the top is kind of
like the top I just showed you it's just
a halter style therto kind of talked the
bra that I usually wear with these types
of things which I get asked so much
got it from the Sun's up but it's just
it clips in the front and it's sticky
and it sticks and there's no back to it
and no top like no shoulder straps or
anything and yeah so if I can find the
link to it I'll leave it down below but
those are the types of bras that I
usually wear with this type of thing and
yeah so next we went to the I believe
it's called the Chinook mall in Calgary
so I went to Africa me and Fitch and I
actually picked up a new pair of
jeggings and as you guys know you pretty
much never see me wear jeans and it's
because I hate jeans
nobody really actually likes jeans but
these jeans feel like leggings and they
were on sale they're originally $84 and
they are on sale for 40s so I picked
them up in the light color and care
about them in the darkest color and
they're so comfy they're super stretchy
like I'm talking like these don't feel
like jeans and I got them in this light
wash color and you're gonna be seeing
this as well in a back-to-school video
because I don't know genius just scream
back to school I just feel like that's
always a back-to-school thing is like a
new pair of jeans and also I have this
weird thing where my sweatpants just
keep disappearing like completely
disappearing I have like one pair of
sweatpants left and at one point I swear
I had six so I don't know where all my
sweatpants are going so I picked up a
new pair these ones are on sale at the
back of the store I forget how much they
were but they're originally they're
originally 64 dollars but I got them on
sale but I totally forget how much I got
them for but they're just like this gray
just sweater material just a sweat pant
material and I like this kind because I
like to roll them over and then they
just have a good circle here just as I
become me pitching it and I need to
sweatpants to be tight at the bottom I
can't do flared sweatpants it just
bothers me for some reason they still
smell like the Cologne in the store so
next I went to pink and picked up just a
couple things the first thing I got was
off the sale rack and I was wearing it
yesterday so it's all tangled
it was $11 and it's just a black baggy
tank top with the little dog in the
front and then the back just has a
stripe down the middle I just needed
more loose-fitting tops for running and
I didn't have a black one as silly as it
sounds so that was the top I got from
rejoicing
and they're just comfy for lounging
around the apartment also I'd like to
let you all know that I'm very aware
that I have a shopping problem and I
don't want to seek help the next thing I
got and I'm obsessed with it I know I
say that a lot but like I wore this the
whole plane ride home and it was just so
comfy and so cozy and this is gonna be
such a staple for me this fall it's this
crew sweater from pink so I got the one
I was originally gonna get it in the
pink but I'm so glad I got the burgundy
white I just liked it so much better
I just find it suits me and it's just
something I don't have already in my
closet and I have a lot of neon pink so
this is what it looks like it's just
black burgundy and gray like salt and
pepper kind of on the top and it's got
just a little black doggy and that's
that's it it's so weird that it's like
August and I'm talking about fall I'm so
sorry if I'm like triggering this way
too soon on you guys I'm not trying to
end your summer I just I get way too
excited when fall comes around and the
last thing I thought was just a knapsack
and I needed a new carry-on when I was
out there so I figured a knapsack would
be a good thing to get just with some
back-to-school videos coming up soon too
so this was the one that I got from
Victoria's Secret and this is so good
for traveling and had a slot for my
laptop and had enough that I could put
just an overnight outfit in on my
carry-on I could fit my makeup my camera
pretty much almost everything that I
didn't want to lose in case my suitcase
went missing I fit in this and it was
really heavy but it fits so much stuff
so last but not least I just have this
stuff from Charlotte Russe to show you
guys so first things first if you guys
watch Teen Wolf Lydia oh it's has like
the cutest outfits and shoes and I
always see her rock these pairs of shoes
and I could not for the longest time
find them I've been trying to buy a pair
of shoes like this for a year and
finally I found them on Charlotte Russe
and they actually had my size in stock
and just just look at this look at this
perfection right now these shoes are my
life my heart is just as happy as can be
so they're just this suede material
there in like an oatmeal beige sort of
color with a brown heel and they're just
so cute and you can wear them in the
summer
or you can rock them in the fall and
I've just been waiting so long to find
these shoes and I finally found that and
yes they're gonna be in upcoming videos
so I just there's just so many videos
coming right now
and I'm just so excited about it next is
this top that I got from Charlotte Russe
and again it's going in there's all of
this stuff from Charlotte Russe is
pretty much gonna be in one video so
just know that you will be seeing that
one very soon but this is what it looks
like here it's just a white like sheers
style top and it's got some crochet
detailing up at the top here and this is
like a light pair of jeans I just feel
like it's such a cute little back to
school outfit so next from Charlotte
Russe I picked up these pair of pants
and a material of them I can't really
explain they're really stretchy they're
not like leggings at all no more like
they're more like a dress pant but
they're super stretchy and really comfy
and I just got them in black and they're
nice and high-waisted and I just figured
these are really cute for when you're
like a meeting or an interview or
whatever it is these are just really
comfy or even just like a date they're a
really cute pair of pants and their
fancy without being too fancy and
they're black so that you don't have to
wear black jeans and I just don't have a
pair of pants like this so I'll pick
these up and the next I picked up this
dress here it's just like a cream color
it's got white underneath with a cream
lace like overlay this is really awkward
for me to try and show you guys but it's
just it's a little bit off the shoulder
it goes pretty far off and the back is
super open like really long scoop back
with a strap in the middle here and then
the loops I picked up to go with it are
these ones here and you're gonna be
seeing a lot of boots and booties if you
guys can't already tell even just from
my summer videos I wear booties all the
time so I picked up a new pair and these
are just like a chestnut almost like
light brown chestnut color and they are
super comfortable and those are the
boots that I picked up to go with that
job so the next time I picked up was
this time here and it's in like a dark
gray suede type of material and I'm
literally so in love with the way this
turned out when I tried it on it just
has this like nice like crisscross sort
of netting in the middle and it's a crop
top so you can wear it with so many
different outfits and I'm just really
excited to rock this and
for flats I picked up this new pair here
for a back-to-school video obviously and
they're in like this dark almost burnt
burgundy color and I love flats but I
find sometimes they make me look like I
have clown feet and I don't even have
big feet but I just I just sometimes
find flats look weird on me so I love
that this one had like an ankle cuff
almost to it which adds a little bit
more to the shoe and I just I think it
just I don't know I like the way they
fit I think it looks a lot better for
just me personally so these are the
shoes that I picked up they have like a
little lace up in the front and they
cuff up around your ankle and then
they're just like a normal kind of
pointed toe flat and they are like
burgundy and they have a zipper to get
in and out of more easily so those are
the little flats that I picked up and
then lost it not least I got a cape and
that sounds weird and Meg's and I were
laughing about it last night because I
was just like man I'm I got a cape and
I'm in love with my cape but I actually
did get a cape from Charlotte Russe so
it's gonna look terrible with a sweater
but I'm just going to show you guys how
to wear it because it's just it wouldn't
do it justice trying to explain it so
usually you wouldn't wear it with a
running sweater underneath but this is
what it looks like and then it just kind
of looks more like it looks like a
blazer but it's not it's more Stokes the
style of Cape kind of looks like you've
just like draped a jacket over you and
they just love this I think it's so nice
and it'd just be nice just like we're
going out for like a fancy dinner or
just like I don't know I just I really
like it and it's a cake and it's just
something I totally don't have in my
closet and I thought it would be really
cool and I don't like the way Blazers
look on me so I think capes are gonna be
my new blazer so that is it for my
back-to-school slash end of summer haul
I hope you guys enjoyed and I will leave
as many links as I can down below keep
in mind that life is never about the
amount of clothes you have or like what
you have or whatever it's not important
I just I like doing hauls for you guys
you guys seem to really like them and I
have a shopping problem so it kind of
makes me feel a little bit less guilty
about it but I always want you guys to
know when I do these kinds of videos I'm
not trying to like show off or be like
look at all this stuff you have to buy
it's not
that I'm just inspiring you guys maybe
in some fashion choices and fashion
videos are probably my favorite ones to
make that said you have enough no matter
what you have in life take it from
somebody that does shop a lot buying
things will never make you happy and
it's just a false illusion of Happy's so
treat yourself every now and then as you
can see I like to do but just know that
it's not about what you have or what you
buy and no you don't need to go have a
huge back-to-school shopping spree if
you can't you can always revamp things
that you have in your closet and reuse
and kind of twist them around and stuff
but I just wanted to throw that in on
the end of this video here because I
just know myself from watching people's
hauls sometimes I'm like damn it now I
want to go shopping I need to go file
this stuff and it's just it's not like
that I'm just showing you guys the stuff
that I recently purchased and
accumulated not all in one go so yeah I
just really gets really important to
just sew that in on the end here except
don't want you guys to get the wrong
idea buy this to these types of videos
I'm not yeah I don't know how to explain
it but anyway it's just like me showing
like my best friend like oh the shopping
spree I had because that's what you guys
cut art to me you're like my best
friends anyway so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys all in all the videos coming up
soon and yeah I'm just really excited
and really happy and I hope you guys
aren't happy and having a great day and
if not then just keep watching my videos
because the happy squad will come and
make you happier I don't know what I'm
why am I saying the weirdest things
right now anyway so other than that I
will see you guys all in a future video
and yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
