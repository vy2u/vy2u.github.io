share with you guys my essentials for
the cottage and just my basic makeup
routine and my outfit so usually for the
cottage I always need to pack a hat and
some tanning oil since I like to tan at
the cottage I also like to bring some
sea salt spray for my hair from after
swimming and some leave-in conditioners
since my hair if it's really dry from
being outside and the wind and the Sun
and by the fire and of course you can't
forget to bring your sunglasses either I
also like to bring dry shampoo and just
use that when my hair gets oily and some
sunscreen but mostly this is for Ryan
because I don't burn like he does and of
course my secret clinical deodorant
which actually releases its scent when
you are sweating or stressing more so
it's my favorite deodorant and of course
we need some sweat pants and a hoodie
for being by the fire and to keep away
from all the bugs so now that my bag is
packed for the cottage I'm just gonna go
through a basic routine of what I would
wear for makeup wise at the cottage I
don't wear makeup all the time but if I
do it's just a little bit like this and
it's usually just for dinner and I am
just putting on my Olay fresh effects BB
cream because it's my favorite BB cream
for wearing when I'm camping or by the
feature outside because it adds a lot of
moisture while adding a little bit of
coverage as well and then just a little
bit of setting spray
and brows are something that I usually
do regardless every single day so I'm
using my covergirl brow and liner powder
and this has been my most favorite
on-the-go brow product and then just a
tiny bit of waterproof mascara so that's
usually all I wear really for makeup if
I'm going to be wearing makeup at the
cottage and by all means I am NOT saying
to wear makeup out of cottage this is
just my little routine for if I do
and then outfit wise I like to keep my
open set the cottage pretty simple
because I mean you're kind of just like
exploring and outside a lot so I always
bring like a big hoodie or a tunic and
this one is actually from Victoria's
Secret and it's my recent favorite since
it's awesome for even just over top of
your bikini and I usually just wear my
bikini under it and then a loose pair of
shorts and a hat and some sunglasses
and that's usually my standard outfit
every time we go to the cottage so that
is it for my essentials and my basic
makeup and outfit routine for going to
the cottage I hope you guys enjoyed and
if you guys want to see more cottage
videos than just thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
