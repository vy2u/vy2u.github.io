meet them but I hope I never see them
again
I know it breaks your heart no to the
city and I broke down guard for years no
calls now you're looking pretty and
Casta good morning guys it is Thursday
December 8 826 in the morning I got up
about a half hour ago and was letting in
bed for a while because first of all I
did not sleep at all as I didn't pull
sleep till 4:30 and then even once I
fell asleep I kept on waking up with
stiff neck I don't know if any of you
guys get that
sorry guys apparently I'm getting sick
too actually heading to an appointment
now I'm not exactly sure what's going to
happen I'm going to go check out a jeep
today so I'm gonna drink this coffee I'm
gonna get ready and then I'm gonna go
hopefully I mean maybe pick out a Jeep
frankly it's just driving and I'm
obsessed unluckily definitely
you
so I'm finally feeling somewhat human
again I got up today I still feel like a
little bit sick but I decided that I
literally just couldn't spend another
day in bed went out for lunch with my
friends Maggie and Kristen hung it with
my brother for the day and now Here I am
I'm probably gonna vlog the next day or
two as well so I can show you guys me
picking up my Jeep as well as just more
footage because I haven't blogged so
much since I've been sick she's kind of
a really really chill Saturday night
because even though I feel better I
don't want to overexert myself and then
push myself into feeling more sick
especially since like I don't know if
you guys can tell but like my tonsils
especially this one here it's like super
swollen so I don't want to risk that
biscuit you know time to put on some
drink
last night I oh you don't wanna hang out
with us
so last night I went through my Beauty
room and I clear know about two massive
garbage bags and like a bunch of boxes
worth of stuff that I'm gonna go donate
to the Salvation Army
kinda like declutter and get rid of all
of the excess things that I have that I
just don't need or I don't you and I've
been looking up apartments all morning
um and I booked a few appointments to go
look at some on Tuesdays morrow I get my
Jeep Tuesday I go look at it a bunch of
apartments in Toronto and then oh I'm
just so excited and then Friday I leave
for New York so this week is going to be
a crazy hectic one when I say I cried
about this I mean I've called about this
okay let me explain when I got the flu I
was so like I was in so much denial that
I was sick because I've been so behind
on work I'm gonna try really hard not to
get upset right now okay I was super
emotional because it's like my time of
the month so like the tiniest things
have been making me cry this weekend and
I just can't handle it I'm gonna bring
you guys closer if you like you're so
far away from me when I got sick I was
like I'm not sick I'm not sick and even
though my body felt like never been sick
like that before in my life it was like
my body was exhausted no matter how much
I wanted to like move and do things and
like get things done that I knew I
needed to get done
I couldn't move for my bed because my
body wasn't only just like exhausted but
it was aching like I was in so much pain
I don't know why my body's aching maybe
I just need to take a bit of a break and
then I ended up having the flu for like
three or four days and then like bawling
because I was so it put me so behind
today I'm still feeling a little weak as
well but like I'm definitely feeling a
bit better just doing work all the time
is easy for me but lately it's been a
little harder so I'm not trying to come
up with excuses I don't want you guys to
feel bad for me I don't want a copy I
can't stress myself out to the point
where I make myself sick again does that
make sense
and I love the Christmas time and I just
want to enjoy this last Christmas being
at home
it ends up being that I have to vlog for
12 days I'll do it the long story short
I'm going to try my best to get the 12
days of Christmas done I'm currently
watching The Secret Life of the American
teenager don't ask me why I just decided
to watch it all over I never want you
guys to feel like I'm cutting you out or
like I don't want you guys to know
what's going on because I want to know
what's going on in your guys's life and
I want you guys to know what's going on
in my life so I feel like I've bored you
for long enough so let's get back to you
know the regular vlog stuff shall we
what is wrong with me today oh my god
today's the big day that I pick up my
Jeep I'm just like waiting for the guy
to text me maybe that's him sitting in
your new car
I'm officially picked up my Jeep it's no
longer daylight so you're not going to
but figured I'd show you guys one last
clip of it before I completely conclude
this vlog pretty sure my Colin Jersey
we're not I'm gonna go for a drive I'm
gonna grab a coffee because I have a lot
to edit and a lot of things to do so
