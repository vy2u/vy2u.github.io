to be showing you guys some really easy
DIY presents you can make for your
friends family boyfriend or anyone else
so to start out I'm showing you guys
this choc mug and you're just going to
need a mug some tape and some chalkboard
spray paint and I'm just using the tape
to cover anywhere on the mug that I
don't want to get paint on and then I'm
going to go ahead and take it outside
and spray paint the chalkboard paint
everywhere
I want the chalkboard to be once dry go
ahead and take the tape off and you'll
have your own little chalkboard mug you
can make and you can write messages on
it in the mornings and stuff for the
person that it's for so let's say you
gave it to a boyfriend you could write
good morning handsome or little messages
or for a friend or anything like that
for this next DIY you're going to need a
canvas some tax or nails and some yarn
and for however you're making this for
you could maybe make out the drawing of
a state you could make up their letter
of their name you could really design
anything you wanted and then just go
ahead and use nails or tacks to put them
in the canvas and then take the yarn and
kind of weave it through all of the
nails and tacks until you get this
really cool design
you
you
this DIY is really cheap and easy and it
looks really cute and personalized for
whoever you're making it for for this
next DIY you're going to need some cork
boards some Scrabble pieces and a hot
glue gun as well as some scissors and
I'm just taking the letters out of the
Scrabble pieces and writing out the
words that I want to do and I suggest
doing five letters across and four
letters up once you have it designed out
go ahead and cut the same size cork
board to put the letters on and then
what you're going to do is take the hot
glue gun and start hot gluing the
letters in the order that you want them
to say the words that you made
once done you have these really cute
personalized coasters that you could
give to your parents your friends or
anyone else that you know for this next
DIY I'm using a cardboard and some
cardstock as well as some lined paper a
pen scissors and some glue and one of
when to be doing is be making a mad libs
and this is a really cute way to
personalize a gift especially if you
don't have a lot of money to spend so
just go ahead and grab some pretty paper
and some lined paper and just cut the
paper so that it decides to fit on the
cardstock and then go ahead and make
your own mad libs you could make this
personalized to whoever you're going to
give it to and then once it's filled out
you just glue it to the card stock and
put it on the clipboard and you can make
as many Mad Libs as you want so that
they have lots to do and then it's a
really really fun and funny gift to give
somebody
this next DIY gift is really really good
for a mom sister or maybe a friend you
have and you're going to need some sugar
some olive oil some food coloring as
well as a little bit of peppermint oil
so I'm just putting some sugars some
olive oil and some food coloring in as
well as a little dollop of peppermint
oil and then mixing it up until it is
all mixed and it turns into this really
really pretty red color and then I'm
just going to put them into little mini
mason jars and put little labels on them
that is says peppermint body scrub
because it smells nice and peppermint
tea and it looks really really festive
and it's really nice for scrubbing or
exfoliating your skin and it's perfect
for any girl that or boy that you might
want to give it this little DIY gift too
so this next gift is really good for a
boyfriend or girlfriend or maybe your
even your parents and you're just going
to need some card stock some paper pen
scissors and glue and I'm just cutting
the card stock into even squares and
then I'm going to cut the lined paper
into a smaller square so I can put it
onto the card stock I'm not just writing
little coupons on them like maybe doing
some chores making the dent making
dinner cleaning my room that was stuff
you could write for ones if you were
making them for your parents or if
you're making some for your boyfriend or
girlfriend you could write things like
dinner on me or I'll do the laundry or
anything fun like that
so this gift is really personalized and
really cute for anyone that you're going
to be giving it to and it is especially
good if you don't have a lot of money so
this last DIY is my favorite and I'm
just going to be using a leg warmer I
got from the dollar store and then
cutting it to size with the mug and then
I'm just going to cut a little slit in
the side and then instantly you have a
little sweater for people's mugs this
one is my all-time favorite one that I
did in this and I made a bunch of these
that I'm going to be giving to my
friends and family and it's a cute
little sweater you can put on your mug
to keep your hands from getting too hot
when you touch it and I just think it is
so cute and it looks really good on any
mug and really festive for the winter
time
well that is it to my DIY Christmas
gifts I hope you guys enjoyed and I will
see you guys all in my next Christmas
countdown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
