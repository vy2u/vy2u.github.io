to be doing a Fitness Friday are you
feeling good today
no you just slept all day so not too
long ago it was requested that I did a
video where it was more so some DIY
workout clothes so that is the video
that I filmed for you guys today also I
have been getting super into yoga lately
and just so many other Fitness related
things that I don't know how to exactly
incorporate them into Fitness Fridays so
I was wondering if you guys would be
a-okay with doing some fitness Fridays
also on my second channel so instead of
sometimes uploading a Fitness Friday
always to this channel sometimes the
Fitness Friday would go up on my second
channel and it would be more like a vlog
type Fitness Friday in the sense that I
would share with you guys what at 8
throughout the week and what type of
exercises I did throughout the week so
if that is something you guys want then
just either thumbs up this video or just
comment it down below that you guys
would enjoy that type of video so that
it's not always kind of these this style
of fitness Friday that there are some
vlog or like fitness vlogs on my second
channel for Fitness Friday so other than
that if you guys want to see some fun
DIY workout clothes then just keep
watching
so for my first stop I just have this
tank top from Walmart but you can use
any old tank top from your closet and
then I'm just taking these iron-on
letters that I also picked up from
Walmart and ironing on a fitness quote
now I'm a runner and I like to run so I
chose run rest repeat but you can choose
any type of fitness related quote that
you like and already you have a tank top
completely redone and revamped and ready
to get fit with and as for this next DIY
this is a really easy little pocket
holder for your iPod or iPhone so just
cut off the foot part of any tube sock
and then put it on your arm inside out
and then fold it in half and because the
tube sock is so tight it will hold your
iPhone or your iPod in place while you
listen to music while you're getting all
fit and cardio or weights or whatever it
is that you do and then you just pop
your headphones in and it's just off out
of your hands or off the equipment and I
did test this out if you'll see that
right about here I jump up and down and
move my arms around and it doesn't fall
out because it's super tight and the
awesome thing about this is you can use
all different types of colored tube
socks to match your outfit
and of course who doesn't love a good
sports bra so this sports bra is one
that I had from Walmart and I'm just
taking some bigger iron-on letters and
you could really play around with the
words you want to put on here you could
put gym you could put run you could put
lifts you could put really anything but
I decided to go with pink since it's not
only one of my favorite colors but just
because it also kind of looked like a
Victoria Secret sports bra so I just
went ahead and ironed those on and then
of course once you peel all your letters
back you have a nice revamped sports bra
that's really cute and fun for working
out but I suggest if you're going to a
gym that you put a shirt on next I'm
going to be showing you guys these
leggings so I just grabbed these twelve
dollar leggings from a store and this
fabric marker from Walmart and you can
go really crazy with this one make all
these different intricate designs but I
decided to keep mine a little bit simple
by just doing some straight lines and
triangles but you can really get fancy
with this one and creative but just make
sure that you leave it to dry for about
24 hours before you go wearing it or
washing it
and of course once done you have a cool
little design on your leggings that you
made and as for this yoga top I love
having big baggy tops on when I'm doing
yoga so I grabbed this other t-shirt
from Walmart which was only nine dollars
and I'm just cropping it and then
cutting out the neck and then once
that's all done I'm just again taking
some iron-on letters and writing my yoga
top but you could get all fancy with
this one and do all different types of
things with your quote but I decided to
just keep it nice and simple with my
yoga top and then again I'm just ironing
on the letters
and of course once done you have a big
slouchy shirt to do your yoga in and
it's super comfortable and as for this
headband like I promised you guys I'll
show you how to make it so I just
grabbed this white headband and I made
sure that it was damp before crunching
it up into a ball and then just adding a
bunch of elastics around it and then I'm
just going to take three different
colors of tie-dye which were green blue
and purple and just put the dye all over
it so that it's got a really funky
design
so of course you're going to want to
leave it to dry and then wash it before
wearing it but once done you have a
really cool tie-dye headband and I've
just been obsessed with tie-dye lately
so I've been wearing this for working
out quite a bit so those were all of my
little DIY workout clothes I have a
couple other ideas of mine so if you
guys want another DIY workout clothes
just go ahead and let me know down below
and I will see you guys all in my future
video be sure to let me know which one
was your favorite down below hi guys
because I had caffeine that's why I'm
really hyper been give me attention kiss
it better
I never forget you
you right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
