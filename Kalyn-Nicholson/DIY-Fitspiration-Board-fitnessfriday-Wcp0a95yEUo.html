teaching you how to do these DIY
expiration boards and two different ways
you can do them so starting out with
supplies you're going to need magazine
clippings or you can use computer
printouts it's totally up to you I'm
going to show both ways in case you
don't have a printer some scissors some
glue and then either canvas or bristol
board or poster board whatever you want
to use I'm gonna start out with the
canvas one so I got this canvas from the
dollar store and Bentley was being super
cute right here so I had to zoom in and
show you guys and basically what I'm
doing is taking magazine clip boats and
cutting them out just anything
fitness-related
that seems to be inspiring and putting
it on the board
so once I've positioned everything where
I want it I'm going ahead and using blue
you guys can use Mod Podge or a glue
stick or tape and just putting
everything into place of where I want it
to be
once then you'll have something that
looks quite like this I like to put
recipes and workouts on this one too so
next I'm going to be showing you how to
do it from print out pictures so I used
to be heart it and just Google or put in
the search engine fits bow or fits
bration I've done a bunch of pictures
and put them on WordPad and then went
ahead and printed the mail
then of course you go ahead and just cut
out each of the individual pictures and
then line them up all over the poster
wherever you want them to go for this
one I'm using poster board and basically
I'm just placing them where I want
everything to be glue
then once you have everything in place
go ahead and glue it down or Mod Podge
it down and you're basically done so I
hope you guys enjoyed these Fitz bration
boards you can put them up on your
fridge or on your wall to keep you
inspired to stay fit and if you just
need something to look at to get you
going through the day so I hope you guys
enjoyed this Fitness Friday and I'll see
you guys on if you join
