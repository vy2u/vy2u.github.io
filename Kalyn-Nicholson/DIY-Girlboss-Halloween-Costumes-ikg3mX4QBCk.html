my channel today is the 16th day of you
tober and today's video is so festive
I'm actually super excited about it so I
wanted to do a bit of a twist on the
standard like DIY costume so when I was
putting together some ideas of costumes
I could do with you guys I started to
realize that every costume that I was
writing down was very like boss-lady
like all of them were very independent
boss like females and suddenly it
clicked so all the costumes in this
video are kind of like girlboss inspired
doesn't see five girl boss costumes that
you can do very easily at home yourself
then just keep watching
so for my thumb will costume I started
by just doing my normal foundation
routine and makeup routine all the way
up into the time that I did the eye
shadow I just did a bit more of an
orange II toned eyeshadow to play off of
the oranges and burgandy's in the
costume and then I also used the eyebrow
like cream that I use for my audre of
the gel and made little freckles on my
face so that is pretty much it and then
I did like a standard lip color and then
put on some false glasses and there you
have it a super easy balance as for the
wig I picked it up off of Amazon threw
that on since I obviously don't have
short black hair and then all you need
for the actual costume itself is a
burgundy or a red style skater skirt and
orange cropped sweater some knee-high
socks and some burgundy shoes that's
literally it you could just pull things
out of your closet
pasen Scooby Snacks so I got the
randomest idea instead of doing a Baby
Spice costume to do the most basic of
girl costumes a pumpkin spice so it is
inspired by Baby Spice from Spice Girls
except I'm doing everything orange
instead of pink I bought this a little
Halloween like face paint kit from
Amazon as well and I just started by
putting white all over my face and kind
of creating where it was gonna be
cracked along the side of my face and
the makeup is just makeup that I had
from the Velma costume but you could do
your everyday just like a pretty like
girly kind of makeup and then I just
created the pumpkin on my face as you
can see here and then I'm not gonna lie
I used like matte liquid lipstick to
fill in the lips of the jack-o'-lantern
but then I also used it to define the
black all over my face considering the
face paint that I got from Amazon wasn't
as dark as I intended so yeah that was
literally it and it was like this one
was probably my favorite costume because
it hit me like a ton of bricks the idea
and I was like I have to film this I
have to do it
place it in face you got I can't say
like their age number baby sheep really
so of course for the hair we had to do
the signature Baby Spice pigtails so I
just pulled my hair up into two tall
pigtails on top of my head and then I
used a dark scrunchie and an orange
scrunchie to kind of differentiate the
half that was pumpkin in the half that's
baby spice and yeah and then as for the
costume itself I just put on an orange
romper you could really get creative
with the costume though anything like
orange and girly and then as for the
shoes I had to put on some good old you
know platform shoes because that's
always what baby spice and as for the
Wednesday Addams costume again I just
went ahead and did my normal foundation
routine you can do most of your regular
makeup for this the only thing I would
suggest is doing a little bit of a
bright highlight like with your
concealer and then just using darker
eyebrows especially since I was going to
be putting on a black wig so I went a
little darker on the eyebrows and then
as for the eye shadow I basically
created like a dead smokey eye so I
brought the smokey eye really far into
the inner corner of my eye onto the
bridge of my nose to make it look a
little bit more like dead or like dark
circles or dark eye sockets and then
just made sure to blend it all out threw
on some lashes and some fake freckles
yet again and put on some black lipstick
and called it a day
so again for the wig I just picked this
one up off of Amazon and I just put a
little hair cap underneath to cover up
my actual hair and then I braided it
into the typical wednesday addams braids
because i didn't like any of the wigs
that I found for wednesday addams so I
just made this one kind of the way that
I actually wanted it and you could go
ahead and wear just like a black skater
dress or t-shirt dress with a white
collared shirt underneath I didn't have
that so I just put on the black romper
but again you could pretty much wear
anything you want as long as it's black
and one of my favorite movies and
favorite characters would be Greece and
of course sandy from Greece so I decided
to throw that in here because I mean
she's also a pretty typical girl boss I
love her so again I just did at my
standard foundation and pretty much my
standard makeup I just went really light
on the eyes and made sure to contour my
face the biggest thing here is that you
just wear red lipstick you could really
do the rest of your face Aubrey you
wanted so I just put on this red liquid
lipstick and then topped my hair off by
curling it as super tight as possible so
the actual curling iron that I used is a
Bellamy curling wand and I just used the
smallest barrel that they had I believe
it was under an inch for the curling
wand itself and that's all you have to
do I mean realistically you could make a
faux bob by tucking your hair in if it's
long like mine but I decided to just
leave it because I don't know it was fun
and then us for the costume we just
needed off the shoulder black top some
high-waisted black pants and some red
heels or red shoes
and last but not least we have Kim
Possible guys I wish I could actually
explain to you how obsessed I was with
Kim Possible when I was younger so for
the Kim Possible costume again I just
went ahead and did pretty standard
makeup didn't go too crazy on the eyes
and I also didn't put any mascara on the
bottom since she doesn't look like she
wears much makeup in the actual cartoon
itself and then the trick here for the
lips is to use foundation or concealer
on your bottom lip and then use an
orange color for just your top lip to
get that like Kim Possible cartoon look
and I just threw on an orange wig and
some green army pants which kind of
reminds me of Mean Girls LOL and a black
long sleeve and a utility belt thing
that I got from a costume store I think
it was actually for Batman but it works
for Kim Possible too and then topped it
off with some black sneakers and there
you have it impossible
for my DIY girlboss costumes i hope you
guys enjoyed it be sure to tweet or
Instagram them at me if you guys decide
to recreate any of them and aside from
that I will see you guys all in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
