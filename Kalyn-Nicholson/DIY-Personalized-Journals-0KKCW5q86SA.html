hey guys so I recently instagrammed a
picture of my journal and a cup of
coffee and many of you are asking where
I got the journal and I actually made it
myself so today I'm going to be showing
you this DIY personalized journal so
grab your cup of coffee and let's get
started
I also made another 8tracks playlist
personalized for this video for music to
listen to while journaling and drinking
your morning coffee so to get started I
went on we hearted and picked out a lot
of pictures that I liked for inspiration
or anything that I just wanted to put on
to the journal itself so you can go on
tumblr and do this or on we heart it or
find any pictures lyrics or anything you
like and then I went ahead on to WordPad
and position them out and went and
printed them up
Oh
I'll stand in my
now I'm using three different journals
to show you guys the ranges in size and
prices that you can do this with as well
as I went and bought some cute stickers
that I liked for inspiration for the
front of the journal as well so
obviously to start you're going to want
to cut out all of the pictures that
you're going to be using for your
journal and you guys don't have to use
pictures you can get really creative
with this and use magazine articles or
type out some of your favorite quotes
and lyrics you can really do whatever
you like with this journals now I'm
going to be using Mod Podge as my glue
for the back of the pictures and I'm
just going to put this all over the
picture or all of the journal and seal
it into place the first thing I like to
do is kind of position where I want the
picture then before gluing it before you
make any mistakes this generally you see
me working on here was actually only 99
cents and I put on all the pictures and
then put on the stickers that I like
then I moved on to this journal which
had a bit of a pattern on it so I didn't
need to put the pictures so close
together because I had a cute pattern in
the background and then the third
journal you see is actually going to be
my backup journal since I'm pretty close
to finishing on the last pages of the
original journal that you guys saw in my
Instagram picture
now this tip I found really important in
its I'm going to seal it all into place
of a layer of Mod Podge on the top it
dries clear and this is just going to
keep it from getting any wreckage from
you know being dirty or having something
spilled on it and this is the final
result of all three journals I'm like
madly in love with them and I'm so
pumped to use mine
this in that moment I was infinite
journal I'm deciding to use this add
like moments that I want to remember for
like ever just one of those moments
where you know it kind of takes your
breath away so you write down your
moment in your journal and then this is
obviously just going to be my original
backup journal and this journal here
that I made I'm actually going to do a
giveaway with this so read the
description bar down below to figure out
how you can win this personalized dinner
journal that I made just for you and so
check out the description bar for that
also don't forget to go check out the
playlist so I hope you guys enjoyed this
