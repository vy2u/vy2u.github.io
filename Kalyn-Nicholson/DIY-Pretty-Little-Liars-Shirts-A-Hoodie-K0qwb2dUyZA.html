showing you how I made these DIY Pretty
Little Liars shirts and sweaters and
starting out I'm using these two
templates that I'm going to leave down
below on my blog or you can make them
yourself I just made them on a word pad
and I'm using these print and press from
Walmart they're just iron-on letters so
before you print out your things make
sure you flip them horizontally too
because remember we're going to be
putting these on t-shirts so we need
everything to be flipped backwards
basically and go ahead and print them
out onto transfer sheets or iron-on
sheets whatever you want to call them
then go ahead and cut nice and close out
few letters that we made
do do you
so once you have them all cut out go
ahead and grab a spare t-shirt I got my
warmer youth section and just iron the
place that we're going to be putting the
transfer first to make sure there's no
wrinkles go ahead and Center it and then
iron it into place for about 30 seconds
you want to do this in small circles or
pressing nice and hard and then go ahead
and peel the sheet off
and of course just do the exact same
process with the next shirt now you guys
can use iron-on stickers if you'd rather
do that than the iron-on transfers I
just wanted to design my own shirts
myself but if you guys want to use
stickers or iron-on fabric stickers you
guys can go ahead and use those too so
I'm also going to be cutting these
shirts to make them a little bit more
cute so I'm going to be cutting the neck
and the sleeves off to make it more of a
tank top and then going ahead and
cutting the back just up a slit a little
bit and cutting it across the back so
the back is a little bit shorter and
then creating two notches in the front
so that I can tie the I heart mr. fits
shirt so that's all there is to this I
heart mister fit shirt now mr. Fitz is
probably one of my favorite male
characters on the show so I just had to
make this sure
now for the a shirt I'm going to go
ahead and do the exact same process
cutting off the neck and the arms of the
shirt and then for this design I'm just
cutting up the sides on each side to
make it basically like a penny and then
go ahead and tie off the bottoms but
first I suggest cutting off the hem at
the bottom of the shirt that's going to
make tying it off easier and then go
ahead and not on both sides
so this is the finishing result of the
your mind now kisses a shirt I just
thought this is a cute way to show a
little text that a sent at some point in
the show and I put a little kissy face
on it too
so moving on am using this matte fabric
paint from Walmart we're going to be
using the red coloring on it and I'm
just taking a black hoodie if you guys
can guess why obviously because it looks
like a hoodie so I'm just going ahead
and flattening at the back and seeing
how low the hood the hood falls so that
I can make V a and then I went ahead and
trace little carvings into the sweater
first so that I knew where to follow
along with it then using the paint matte
paint I'm just going ahead and creating
the a and then I'm going to just flatten
it out a little bit and use a little bit
more paint so that it doesn't seem so
thin you can
cuz you are the peace
so you're going to want to let this dry
for about four hours and then once
you're done go ahead and put on your
sweater and you're basically going to
look like a so that is all there is to
this black a hoodie
yeah
so I hope you guys enjoyed these Pretty
Little Liars shirts and the a hoodie let
me know down below which was your
favorite and I'll see you guys in a
future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
