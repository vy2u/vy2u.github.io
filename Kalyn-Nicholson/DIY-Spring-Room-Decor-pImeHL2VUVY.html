hey guys so for today's video I'm going
to be doing some really fun DIYs for the
spring for your room or your apartment
or your house or wherever you live I
decided that our apartment was looking
really dull and after this really cold
winter I just wanted some color so I
started to decorate for the spring with
lots of pretty big flowers and lots of
color and then I figured it was time to
do another DIY decor video I also
uploaded a new coffee talk to my channel
yesterday so I will leave that down
below if you guys are looking to change
up your decor or your living space and
add some color and some fresh new looks
for spring then just keep watching
so this first DIY is perfect for my
fellow coffee lovers and it's super easy
and very chic so what I did is I just
picked up this white mug from the dollar
store but you could make it any color or
any shape you want you could find a
really funky mug if you really wanted to
and then just take a sharpie and write
whatever you want on the front you could
do your initial I just wrote the no.1 as
a number one or you could even write
little inside jokes or quotes with a
best friend and give it to a best friend
and then just grab some pretty fake
flowers for the spring and put it in
this one was super super simple but
really really cute and I loved it for my
desk now this next one you're going to
need a canvas and some paint and a
pencil so if you have a printer I
suggest printing out a map of the world
and then tracing it unfortunately I
don't have a printer so I ended up just
free handing it which is why you guys
might notice that it's not exactly right
but I tried my best
so then I just picked up some acrylic
paint from the dollar store and all
pretty spring colors and then what I'm
going to do is dip my brush in the water
so that it adds a little bit more water
to be acrylic paints because I don't
want them to be super pigmented so I
just dip it into the water and then I
just randomly painted blotches all
throughout the maps making sure to kind
of blend the colors in together so that
it looked really pretty and kind of like
little a little bit of ombre to it
and then once you're done you'll have
this gorgeous colorful piece of wall art
that you could hang anywhere and you can
also theme the colors as well that you
use for the blotches so I ended up
hanging this just over our couch so this
next DIY is another easy one but it
ended up being very cute so what I did
is I picked up these square frames from
our dollar store they are about two
dollars each and because they were brown
I decided I wanted them to be white but
you could spray-paint them any color to
match the theme of your room or just to
go funky colors for the spring if you
really wanted to when you
and then I printed off some vintage
looking ads or logos and some vintage
looking pictures of like Paris and some
flowers and then I'm just cutting them
out and putting them into the center of
the frame for two and then I'm going to
put the frame on a diamond angle and do
Center two other pictures as well
so once then you can hang up your wall
or in any type of formation you want I
decided to go with two straight on the
outsides and then two of the diamond
ones in the center and you could make
these pictures of your friends and stuff
too they don't necessarily have to be
wall art so then moving on to the next
DIY I'm going to show you guys how to
make these really adorable paint pots
that are probably my favorite DIY that
I've done in this video so what I did is
I picked up some of the clay paint pots
from the dollar store and I'm just
spray-painting them white
and then what you're going to need is a
bowl of room-temperature water I know I
have three bowls here but I only ended
up using one and some pretty nail
polishes and I'm using my covergirl
bloom series which has adorable colors
and I'm wearing one of the colors on my
nails right now so then all I'm going to
do is take the nail polishes and drip
them all into the warm water and then
you take your pot and you slowly dip it
into how high you want the paint to go
and then you rest it out to dry and you
can do all different types of colors and
patterns and just make it as funky and
colorful as you want and the color that
I'm wearing on my nails is leading lady
which is such an adorable color and
really really cute for spring
ow
and then after you let it out to dry for
just a few hours you should be able to
rest them wherever you please so I put
it on our fireplace mantel and I just
grabbed some fake plants from the dollar
store to put inside of them just so I
didn't have to water them or keep them
alive so I just grabbed little fake foot
fake leaves and plants and a little fake
plant ball and then a flower for the
center so this next DIY is another easy
one but again one of my favorites and I
will leave these pictures that I used
for these DIYs on my blog so I'll link
that down below but I found these cute
pictures of wall art that was framed on
a white wall over white brick wall so
that sounds confusing but I printed them
out and I use them as the centerpiece
for the frames themselves so it's framed
art in a frame so I ended up putting
these out on our fireplace mantel as
well and I put the one with the black
lips in the middle so it wasn't too many
quotes but the one says darling let's be
adventurous and the other one says the
best is yet to come
we take this party back to my house
nothing
such a bitch
and last but not least are one of my
favorites and they are the ombre pillows
so I'm going to be showing you guys how
I made the two outside ombre pillows so
I just took a spray bottle and sprayed
some plain white pillows that I picked
up from yes gorgeous but you could
probably pick them up at Walmart or
anywhere else and I picked up these
tie-dyed kits from Walmart as well so in
green all I did was add water and then
all I did was concentrate a lot of the
dye at the bottom and then use my hands
to push the dye up so that it gave a
fading ombre effect and then left it out
to dry and then for the second one I
used purple and blue tie-dye and I just
did like a little circle formation so
that it kind of looks like it's blue
that is ombre fading into purple which
is ombre fading into blue and so on and
so forth
and of course you could pick any colors
you want of the tie-dye
or you could do different designs or
actually use the elastics to give the
tie-dye impression I just decided to go
with ombre
misma screen
we could be
anything to
and of course once done I flipped our
old pillows off the couch and added our
new ones so this is how they turned out
looking after I left them to dry and
then I'm just adding two little accent
pillows that I also picked up from
Walmart
you
so those are all of my easy fun spring
DIYs for your room or apartment I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
all in my next video
never Christian
I keep my lips shut tight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
