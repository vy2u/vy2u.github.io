parachute skin so for this first DIY
decor I'm going to be going on we heart
it and picking up some of my favorite
pictures you guys can take some pictures
with your friends pictures of quotes so
you guys can really all decide on your
own I decided to go with some summary we
hard at pictures and just putting them
into WordPad and then printing them out
and I made sure that they were all
relatively the same size
Oh laughter we'll stay
then obviously once they were printed oh
I just went ahead and cut them all out
drowning
that you call
I wanna get lost now the type of
pictures you guys choose is totally up
to you you can do pictures of you and
your friends like I just showed you
there was me and Ryan you can you pick
summary pictures like this or you can do
pictures of quotes it's really all up to
how you want it to look then you're
going to need some clothes pins so I
just picked up these bamboo ones and
either ribbon twine or string and what
you're going to do is just measure out
where you want to hang the pictures and
then cut three identical size pieces of
ribbon string or twine whatever you're
using and then go ahead and pin them up
onto your wall underneath each other or
however like way you want to pin them up
and then go ahead and use the
clothespins to tack the little pictures
onto the string so this is a really
really easy cute way to decorate your
room for the summer it's so summery
because of the whole clothespin thing
and I just think it looks really really
cute
so if you're like me you have a million
in one piece of pairs of sunglasses we
can use this as decor for our room while
organizing them so what I'm going to do
is just take a clothes hanger and close
the sunglasses around on the side
hanging from the clothes hanger itself
so you just go ahead and close them all
and do them all the way up until you
have no more sunglasses and then I'm
just using a little bit of leftover
ribbon to tie a bow just to make it look
a little bit more cute this is such a
simple easy way to hang up your
sunglasses and organize them and it
looks really cute if it's displayed out
in your room as well
and then for this last DIY you're going
to want to print off your favorite quote
so I used a negative mind will never
bring you a positive life and then I'm
using this white picture frame from the
dollar store you guys can get one that
matches your room and then basically
what I'm going to do is using the sheet
layer inside of the picture frame I'm
going to use that as my guideline to cut
around the quote that I'm going to be
using you can lay human be lazy not go
albe then once done just put all the
components back into the picture frame
and then you have a quoted frame picture
and it is this little looks really
really cute I put it up on my window
sill above my bed added some candles and
some fake flowers and it just looked so
cute and I'm loving this so those are
the three simple little DIY things I did
to decorate my room for this summer let
me know which one you guys want to try
out down below or which one was your
favorite and be sure to tweet and
Instagram them to me I will see you guys
all in a peach video bye
I'm gonna hold your body like sweet
sweet rose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
