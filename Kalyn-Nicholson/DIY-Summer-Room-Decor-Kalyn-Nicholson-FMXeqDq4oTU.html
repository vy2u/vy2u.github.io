so for today's video I'm going to be
doing some really fun and really easy
DIY decor pieces for your room where
your apartment for the summertime so a
few of these DIYs were inspired by
Pinterest and a couple of them I came up
with myself and if you guys want to see
some more summer DIYs then just thumbs
up this video or leave a comment down
below because I am planning out my
summer videos right now so this would be
the time to make any special DIY summer
requests or any summer video requests
that you guys might have so other than
that if you guys want to find out six
new DIYs to do it for the summertime for
your room then just keep watching
so this first DIY is a little elephant
hanger and all I did was pick up some
card stock from Walmart and I traced out
a little elephant now you guys could do
any animal you please or any shape that
you please and just make sure that both
patterns are facing the outside of the
card stock and then cut two pieces at a
time so that they're symmetrical
now like I said you guys could do any
symbol you guys want in any color theme
or any card stock that you guys want but
I decided to go with all different kinds
of patterns and then just make all
different elephants okay now I doubled
up on the string that I got from the
dollar store and then I'm just using a
little bit of liquid cement but you guys
could use any type of glue or adhesive
that you like and I'm gluing them
together with the string in the middle
making sure that all of the elephants
are spaced out quite evenly
once done you can hang it up on your
wall or in a doorframe or on a
windowsill or anywhere you like and it's
just a nice little decor piece for the
summer
my next DIY is are these two pillows
here and I just got this pillow foam
from Walmart and I believe it was only
about five dollars and all I'm doing is
taking this mat fabric adhesive and I'm
just creating little arrows with the
black but you guys could do any color
you like and I saw a pillow very similar
to this at Urban Outfitters but it was
super expensive and this I think only
costed me probably about $10 to make
with both pillows so I'm just creating
all different types of arrows facing
opposite ways but again you guys could
go really fancy with this and do
anything that you would like and for the
second pillow I just grabbed one of
these bandana pieces of fabric and I
picked it out in a pattern that I liked
and all I'm doing is just tracing out
the letters - good vibes but again you
guys could do anything you like on the
pillow and then once I've traced it out
I'm just going ahead and cutting it out
and then using a little bit of fabric
glue to glue the letters themselves to
the pillow
it's done you could add these pillows to
your bed or to a couch or I added them
to the little window seat that I have
upstairs and that is all you have to do
for the pillow DIY so for this next DIY
I grabbed a little globe from the dollar
store so I think it only cost me about
two dollars as well as different colored
spray paint from Walmart and again you
guys can do any color you like but I
decided to go with white for the globe
itself and then do gold for the little
part that holds on to the globe and then
I'm just taking a little bit of paint
and I'm using purple and gold too right
not all those who wonder who wander are
lost sorry and you could do any quote
you like but I like this one because it
kind of was travel related and it was on
a globe and then that's all there is
this next DIY is a fun little way to
spruce up your bed for the summertime so
I got all different colored types of
yarn and one of them was kind of ombre
so all I'm doing is just taping it to a
piece of a folder but you could do this
with a clipboard too and then wrapping
it around as many times as looks to make
it look like the tassel is full and then
cutting it at the bottom and then I'm
just creating a little loop at the top
and tying it off with extra yarn so that
it looks like a little tassel
there's no
once then all you have to do is just
grab a little bit of extra yarn and
weave it through the top of all of your
tassels and then you could hang this
from anywhere whether it be the
headboard of your bed or the footboard
of your bed but I decided to do it along
the side right underneath the duvet so
that it pops out of the side and looks
bright and colorful for the summertime
and to fulfill my obsession with plants
I'm making these cute little pin planter
pots that I got from the dollar store
and then all I'm doing is just taking
some paint that I also picked up from
the dollar store and painting the full
outside one full solid color so I went
with lilac for one and then like a
periwinkle blue for the second and white
for the third
if you just keep believing just keep the
plate
and you can get really creative in the
ways you want to design this but I
decided to kind of do some color
blocking so I'm taking goals and just
going along the top of the purple one
and then for the little periwinkle blue
one I'm using tape to tape off
geometrical shapes or just straight
lines and then putting yellow as well
and then for the last one I'm just
taking a little paintbrush and doing
polka dots of all the different colored
paint all over the Paint Pots
and then last but not least all you're
gonna need is a little glass jar now you
can use a fishbowl or this is like a
little terrarium that I picked up on
sale at Urban Outfitters and then I'm
just stringing a little bit of
battery-operated lights inside now
originally this is meant for little
plants but this is just a cute little
way to add a lamp or some light to a
section of your room that might not have
any outlets like this section of my room
so this is just a cute little lamp that
I can turn on now without having to plug
it in so that is it for all my summer
DIYs I hope you guys enjoyed be sure to
leave your favorite down below and I'll
see you guys all in a future video bye
