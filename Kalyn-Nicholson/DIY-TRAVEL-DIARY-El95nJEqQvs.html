today's video I wanted to make a travel
diary with you guys because I actually
something that is just been on my to-do
list in general and so I figured if I
was going to go ahead and do it why not
film it and kind of create a little DIY
video with you guys
so we're going to try and make a travel
diary today and keep our fingers crossed
that it ends up being aesthetically
pleasing as you guys know I've been
doing a ton of chopping lately I made a
whole playlist on my channel of just
like travel vlogs and all the things
that I've been doing and I have even
more traveling coming at the end of this
month I'm going to New York California
and then I have a family trip to the
East Coast in this summer I've been
thinking about doing a child diary for
awhile and I just feel like it's about
time so with no further ado if you guys
want to do a little TI y travel diary
with me then just keep watching
so the first thing you're going to want
to do when it comes to making a travel
or a memory diaries obviously getting a
journal so this one that I got from
chapters but I'll leave some links to
some awesome ones down below or you can
just use whatever blank ones you guys
already have I picked this one because
it had a bunch of cities all over the
front and then starting with the front
page all I did was print out a map of
the world and I'll leave the link to
this in the description box and then I'm
just going to use some cement glue to
cement glue it into place and the trick
here is to cement one side of it and
then fold the book over before cementing
the other side to make sure that the
crease lines up with the fold in the
book and then the cool thing about this
you can really do whatever you want for
the front cover but I decided to do this
that way I could fill in the map as I go
along so every time I travel somewhere
new I can color in that little section
of the map so this is pretty much where
things get creative you can use stickers
you can use photos you already have like
Polaroids but I just printed out a bunch
of lettering and photos and then I just
flew them around the map and then I
colored in places in the map that I've
been and then use a sharpie to kind of
write little cities and places I've been
all over and then every time I travel
somewhere new I can update my front page
but you guys can decorate the page
however you see
and then I suggest making an index that
way when you go about your life and
travel a bunch of different places or
make a bunch of new memories it's easy
to find which one you want to go to and
reminisce on and then after skipping a
few pages I'm starting with my first
page and I'm going to be doing Paris for
this one I'll link that video up on the
screen but I was recently in Paris so I
just went ahead and printed out a bunch
of photos on recycled paper and then
again I'm just cement gluing them all
over I did this one a little bit more
collage style and then printed out some
clipart of like a canon camera and then
I typed out Paris and then Eiffel Tower
again you guys can get super creative
with this and add whatever you like
things like plane tickets will work or
like little places or receipts that you
may have gone to but I decided to add a
little forecast and I just use stickers
to type it out and then a Sharpie to
color it in and I just looked up the
forecast from when I was there
so for my second page I decided to do
Orlando from when I went to playlist in
Universal this is going to be a good
example as making a memory page instead
of a travel page even though this was
somewhere I traveled to it's more so all
the memories I made while I was there so
again I'm just not gluing and using tape
to kind of collage all of these
different things in like places together
and then I'm using some memorabilia like
the wristbands that I had and then just
Mod Podge in that into place
and if you're looking for some extra
ideas to fill up some blank space you
can always print out like logos and
places like that like I did Harry Potter
or take a sharpie and fill in some of
the blank spots and I do this really
weird thing where I like to keep hotel
card so all I did was take a paper clip
and clip that hotel card in there and
then there you have it that is my page
and just to show you guys a third
example I also did a Coachella page
which was really simple I kind of kept
everything more clean and crisp just to
give you guys another example of a
different way to design it and that's
literally as easy as it is to do this
DIY
that was it for my trouser Eddie video I
hope you guys enjoy it if you decide to
make one for yourself or even if you
don't do like travel diaries you can do
just like memories you want to remember
with pictures and things like that then
definitely let me know by tweeting it
instagramming it and tagging me in it
all of that fun stuff because I love
seeing when you guys recreate the things
in my videos so definitely be sure to do
that and uh than that I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys all
[Laughter]
