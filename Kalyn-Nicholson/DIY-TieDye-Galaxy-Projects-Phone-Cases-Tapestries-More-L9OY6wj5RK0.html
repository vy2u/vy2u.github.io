be sharing with you guys some DIY
projects that you can do that have to do
it like tie-dye galaxy and do you mind
that is so rude let's try that again huh
hey guys so for today's video I'm gonna
be sharing with you guys some DIY
tie-dyed projects as well as some like
kind of like galaxy DIY so I've been
really obsessed with tie guy and like
galaxy Prince lately they've just been
my obsession and my kind of theme that I
have going on in my room here so I have
recently changed up my groom I'm getting
my room ready for a room tour and I am
filming my office slash closet tour next
week so big big big video is coming you
guys's way and I know that they are so
highly requested so yeah so you guys are
going to be able to figure out how to
make those how to make that pillow how
to make these cell phone cases and just
like so many colorful really fun things
also I'm going to be giving away the
cell phone cases that I make in this
video they are for an iPhone 5 so if you
guys want to win just go ahead and check
out the details to the giveaway down
below and other than that just keep
watching to find some DIY tie-dye slash
galaxy projects
so for this first DIY just take some of
your favorite paints and then just paint
all over some small canvases I got these
small canvases from the dollar store and
I'm literally just doing this an all
random patterns just adding color and
just meshing them all up until it looks
kind of like it's one big galaxy sort of
design so just keep doing this with all
of your favorite colors and you could do
this on a black canvas if you wanted to
make it more of like a night sky and
then all you have to do is dip a
paintbrush and some white paint and
flick it like you just saw me do there
and then that's it just leave it up to
dry and I decided to do all of the
canvases a little bit different with the
design so that it ended up kind of
different and cool and that's pretty
much just how I did them and then once
they were dry I did nine of them and I
just hung them up as like one art piece
above my bed and I'm obsessed with the
way this one turned out
so then to make a little tapestry or you
could even make this as a duvet cover or
some bedding just take a sheet or duvet
cover and just put elastics on it and
let's just not touch on how
inappropriate that just looked and then
you're just gonna want to soak it with
some water so I'm just using a water
bottle and I'm just spraying it all over
it and then just taking whatever tie-dye
colors that you want and just shake them
up and add them to this sheet or the
debate cover itself and I decided to go
with just pink and yellow and you want
to make sure you really soak it I wish I
had soaked it in more dye because it
ended up a little bit more white than I
wanted but I still really love the
turnout of this one and you could do
this for your bed sheets you can do this
for your bedding or you could do it for
like a tapestry like I did and I got rid
of my old one because it didn't match my
office anymore so that's why I switched
it out for this new tie-dye one stop
just keep
everything's about to change
and since it's summer season it means
we're gonna need some bikini cover-ups
so I bought these little white shorts
from Walmart and I'm just soaking them
with some water and I'm gonna do it I
can arm brace so I'm just taking the
yellow and spraying it all over the
bottom and then spring the green all
over the top and kind of lightly
spraying in the middle so that they kind
of ombre down and then wash them and
once dry you can wear them over your
bikini bottoms like I am here next it's
this little pillow case here that Maggie
made so what she did is she took a
pillowcase and did elastics going down
all the way and so that it was kind of
like stripes and then it ends up looking
something like this and then all you do
is you go back and forth with the colors
you want to do and do one chunk blue one
chunk green or whatever colors you're
doing and that's all you have to do to
make a cute little tie-dyed pillowcase
and as for these cellphone cases I
picked up some acrylic paint from
Walmart and the pink and the green are
actually glow-in-the-dark and all I'm
doing is just taking the paint and just
putting them randomly all over some
clear cases and then just taking a
little ziplock bag and pushing down and
just kind of moving it around to make
some cool designs and then don't forget
to do the sides as well and you could do
this in all different ways I even use
like a knife like this and just swirled
it and it created little holes but you
can get really funky with this and do
any colors you want and that's all you
have to do just leave them out to dry
and then you've got your own tie-dye
galaxy like focus
please
and of course I had to make a galaxy
pillow so all I did was take a
pillowcase or a pillow cover and I just
sprayed all over this with some water to
dampen it for the dye and then I just
took all different types of spray tie
dyes it's really important that you get
the spray ones and just spraying just
like random chunks of color all over it
so that they kind of ombre and mesh into
each other and then all you're gonna
want to do at the very end is grab some
spray fabric paint and I picked up a
white one from warmer and this is it
right here and then just spray on top
and create little like white spots or
stars and then once you wash it and then
leave it to dry this is what your
pillowcase will look like
so thank you guys for watching I hope
you guys enjoyed all these fun DIY
tie-dye and Galaxy projects and I'll see
you guys all in a future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
