my life Monday I'm doing another vlog
with you guys obviously because here we
are
it is currently Thursday December 1st
which is super exciting because that
means we're actually climbing so close
to Christmas it doesn't even feel like
Christmas is around the corner and just
woke up if you can't already tell but my
plan today is I'm gonna change really
quickly and then head to farm boy I'm
going to go grab my groceries because it
is Thursday which means it is a meal
prep day for me
my nail prep today is going to consist
of making breakfast potatoes a snack
smoothie lunch is this like super
healthy sandwich a second snack is a
salad and then for dinner it's a chili
and rice so that is the meal prep I'm
making today but win don't fail I'll
always write down in the description box
what I made for the meal prep that day
as well as if you guys follow me on
Pinterest I made a brand-new Pinterest
board that's called vegan meals and all
of the things that I make for my meal
preps I will tag onto there but yeah
let's get started with our day shall we
understand
I
so it is now Friday morning I told
Bentley we're going for a drive and he's
going crazy now eventful uneventful
Friday my Airbnb for New York are
cancelled which is so weird I understand
my mojo with New York City but I
actually just booked another one and I
think I'm more excited for this one then
I was from my last one for any of you
guys that do live in New York City I
think one of the days I'm gonna tweet
out a location so that we can all meet
up if any of you guys are in the area
anyway family is getting super antsy
about this drive you're excited aren't
you
waking up when it's still dark out is
not an easy thing to do let me tell you
it's out Saturday morning I am heading
to Walmart and then to the mall I have
to grab stuff to decorate my tree for
Christmas and I also have to get a new
iPhone because I'm really really drunk
of my family Thanksgiving I smashed my
phone so I think I might go get the
iPhone 7 we shall see oh and I'm gonna
grab onesies to surprise unique because
lo and I are having a sleepover tonight
so I'm gonna go pick those up too
that awkward moment when the lights you
bought don't match your tree to be
honest guys I'm really not sure how I
feel about the blue in the frosty air
jingle bell time is a swell time to go
glidin the one boom
so now that I am done my workout I'm
just about to pack up my bag Bentley and
I are going to hang out with my friend
mini for the night we're having a
slumber party I think I mentioned us to
do that what have I I don't even think
I've worn makeup in this whole vlog I
swear to God I never wear makeup in my
vlogs I should probably start doing that
because I look so different here as
opposed to in my normal videos it's kind
of hilarious all right walking up I'm
gonna turn off my blue tree that I'm
still feeling and different about Asti I
like it so much better when it's not
blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
