Target while I redecorate my apartment
and of course I'm going to be bringing
you guys along with me so here are some
shots of my apartment before it was kind
of just very drag and very block and not
very trendy so I decided to go and pick
up some pieces and just show you guys
how I decorated my apartment so starting
off with pillows I feel like changing up
the pillows on your couch or bed will
completely change up the look of your
living room so I'm adding these - hold
gold accent pillows to spice up my camp
then of course to top it off I'm using
this threshold gray throw just to throw
over the side of my couch which made my
coach look extra cozy and warm for this
fall season and last but not least I'm
adding this gray poofy stool from Target
and it is all complete I was going for a
very gray and gold metallic theme which
included switching out my really small
and unproportional lamp for this
threshold gray and white accent lamp
with D metallic V and then I also got
these gold and white accent pumpkins
which I think are so cute and very
festive for this season and this twine
fever canoe candle to pull in the gray
accents
so again playing off the patterns and
the golden metallic theme I got this
gold dot phase and I put some pretty
fall flower fake flowers inside and it
just looks so festive and really cozied
up the place and then I purchased the
threshold with an basket these are
perfect for remote controllers makeup a
lot of things that you want to organize
are perfect for these little baskets and
I just put them all in and slid them
into our TV stand which made things look
way more organized so instantly my
apartment looks a million times better
and now I'm going to share with you guys
the fun DIY I did as well so I got this
frame as on discount I think it was like
fourteen dollars and then I pulled five
fake leaves and some white acrylic paint
and gold acrylic paint and some paint
sponges so I'm just going to go ahead
and paint the frame white you guys can
paint this any color that's going to
match your theme that you're going for
either in your living room your bedroom
wherever you're going to put this so I
did a couple coats of white paint and
then I'm going to go ahead and paint the
leaves gold so putting a little bit of
gold paint on each leaf just go ahead
and paint them gold
so after leaving it out to dry overnight
I went ahead and flipped the frame back
over and I just placed the leaves inside
the Glock two pieces of glass and then
put it back on the frame and closed all
the clamps
and now you have this really pretty
really easy gold accent leaf frame which
is super festive for this time of year
and I just loved the way this one turned
out
so those are all the new pieces of DIY
decor I got from my apartment
exclusively from Target I hope you guys
enjoy decorating with me and I'll see
you guys all in a future video
