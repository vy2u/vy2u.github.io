what's up and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm going to be doing
a desk tour with you guys lately you
guys have been requesting a ton of
videos that have to do with organization
getting back to school things about like
how I plan what you're gonna get a
little bit of a peek at that as well in
this video so I decided to do a little
desk tour with you guys because I
recently organized my whole desk system
by moving it in here and I'm going to
link anything that I can find that has
to do with this desk area down below so
definitely go check that out also while
you're at it feel free to check out my
Instagram and my Twitter which should
pop up on this side of the screen here
as well as subscribe if you guys haven't
already and hit the little notification
bellow so you guys know anytime I post a
new video and aside from that I feel
like we've got a lot to towards so let's
just jump right on in and by that I mean
I'm gonna take this off of this tripod
and we gonna do a tour so first things
first this is obviously the desk area I
work from home as you guys probably know
by now so my desk area is quite
important when it comes to work I
decided to put my desk area in my
bedroom just because I wanted it to be
in a more central area plus I could not
beat this view like look can we be real
so first things first this is the
computer chair that I have I got it from
Ikea I'll link it down below if I can
find it and then I just threw this fake
fur throw that I got from HomeSense over
it I just feel like it's cute it's cozy
and it's white so it fits the whole
theme and this chair is way comfier than
the one I had before because it's made
out of actual cushion the desk itself is
from Ikea as well as the topper you'll
notice that I added a topper for my
computer again I'll link those down
below if I can find them and then
underneath I just have a little floor
cushion for Bentley but also in case I
do my makeup in the other rear so I
guess we'll go drawer for drawer in the
first drawer of my desk I'll give you
guys an overview and then go into a
little bit more detail so here I have
two extra books these books I don't use
as often this one is kind of used as
like
planner when it comes to setting goals
like overall goals for the year and
things like that which I've kind of
dived into before with you guys in a
vlog which I will link if I can find it
and then this book here I used to plan
videos I fill out a blank page from
start to finish on what I plan on
putting in each video so that is why
this book is underneath it in the back
there I just have two books that say
goals and bucket lists this is one that
you can fill your bucket list in for
life and this one is one you can plan
out goals I don't really use the goals
one and I filled out some of my bucket
list items in here I want to fill it
more and then beside that I just have my
checkbook which I flipped over
for obvious reasons and then here I keep
my little fake glasses I usually have my
espresso patronum ones here too from
COEs but I have them set out for another
video right now which is why they're not
here but that is usually where my fake
glasses go I actually should have a
prescription because I am blind but I'm
just too lazy let's be real and then
beside that I just have this drawer
organizer that I got off of Amazon I
will link it down below in the first
three I have all of my post-it notes
aside from this little controller this
is for the heater that is actually out
on my patio then I just have my marble
post-its my blank white post-its and my
little mini post-its and I used these to
fill out my you Tober videos post-its
that I used for my agenda I like to keep
the Pens that I use most often in here
and black ink is my favorite and then I
have all my highlighters and these are
probably one of the most used things in
my desk slash organization system I use
highlighters like they're going out of
style this drawer is like things I tend
to grab for more often like post-it
notes my pens and my highlighters so
that concludes what is in the first
drawer of my desk and then as for the
second drawer
this one I keep more of the notebooks
and agendas that I actually use so right
here I just have my ruler if you're
wondering what this is this is just a
muscle relaxer that Greg actually left
here once and I've been keeping it in my
desk I use it because I honestly get
such a sore neck editing videos and
things like that so I just like to keep
this on my desk here I just have my
stapler and my tape dispenser they're
both by this brand called pop in and I
like them just because you know they're
solid white if you can't tell the
here is kind of like black and white but
I got these off of Amazon and again I'll
link them down below and then next to
that I just have this notebook that I
use this is more of like a planning
notebook it doesn't have any lines or
anything so I like to use it kind of
like a bullet journal without the actual
bullets pre hand everything and then
behind that I have my two planners which
you guys would have seen before I'm
actually getting a new planner because I
created one for COEs which you guys will
get your hands on soon this one is one I
use more often but sometimes I toss
between the two this is the Erin Condren
one and I like it because it's got like
the time stamps in it which is great but
sometimes you don't need your time
stamps you just want to make a to-do
list which is what I use this one for
basically if you guys are curious I'll
give you a bit of a hint for the coast
planner that I made it's a combination
of the two where you'll have your time
stamps and your to-do lists basically
like taking both of these and putting
them into one planner but that is just
where I keep my planners in this drawer
and then here again this little paper
tray is also from pop in underneath I
have like a folder of really important
papers and on top of that I just have my
journal slash like
stream-of-consciousness
I keep that under there and then on top
of that this is like my life notebook I
make to-do lists in here I make like
inspiration lists in here I have my
reading lists video lists like anything
that you could possibly put into a list
is in this book and I keep all of it
organized I'll give you guys an idea if
you're curious see I planned some videos
like I draw my life I started planning
that I have my reading list for the fall
in here and how I plan out my work
schedule things like that basically any
sort of life list possible or when I'm
just feeling lower and inspired I pull
this book out and I organize my thoughts
into lists and that concludes of that
drawer so then on top of my desk right
here I just have my keyboard I got this
keyboard cover up from Amazon which I
will link down below but I just thought
it kind of went well with the rest of
the room since I have a gray and
blackish vibe going on and then behind
that I keep my laptop I ordered a bunch
of stickers to come to kind of add to my
laptop including like Gilmore Girls
stickers and things like that so I'm
super pumped about that so this is my
work laptop this is what I bring to
cafes and stuff when I'm doing work on
top I just have like some stickers that
I've picked up from random places along
the way I don't remember where I got
these to but this one is obviously a
Oh sticker this one is from the place
that Elena and I got our tattoos in
Paris and then when you flip it over I
have a bunch more back here a lot of
these ones are from brandy melville one
from Prince Edward Island one from when
I went to Amsterdam I have like 10
stickers coming in the mail so that is
probably gonna happen this week and if
it does I will post it to Twitter for
you guys so definitely check that out so
on this side I just have my quill that I
got from Harry Potter land in Universal
pick this up and Diagon Alley and I just
like to keep you here for decor and also
just because it's acquittal and it's
freaking awesome like you can actually
write with it but I will forewarn you
guys it's a really crappy pen the candle
that I have on my desk right now is
marshmallow fireside and then I just
keep this little container here that I
got from HomeSense and it has every
single sharpie you could possibly think
of including like the fat chunky one so
I keep all those in there because I like
to use sharpies when I use my sketchbook
my computer is just the standard macbook
and we'll get into what these little
post-it notes mean I have my chill AF
playlist from Spotify up which I will
also link my Spotify down below and then
beside that on this side if you guys
remember when I got this mug leave a
comment down below because it was in a
video about two years ago but I have my
little elephant mug with this hey if I'm
gonna be mighty real with you guys I
stole this cactus in Florida when I was
with Katie we were at like this like
event that had all these little fake
cactuses through it in my purse because
we were talking in cowboy accents all
night so we thought it would be funny
plus it's like a dollar store cactus so
it's not that big of a deal right back
here you'll notice that I have this
little crystal this actually changes
color but because it's so light in my
room right now you can't tell but the
crystal itself is actually made from the
Himalayan mountains and it's supposed to
help you concentrate and purify and
things like that I don't really know and
then next to that this is actually a
real cactus that I got from the grocery
store by my house so first things first
in this drawer I got this little
organizer from Amazon and I'll link it
down below as well and now I keep this
drawer organized is on this side I just
keep all of my dry erase markers which I
actually use my dry erase board to plan
out so this side has all the fun colors
like pink orange blue and green and then
right besides I keep all the boring like
standard school colors in here I just
keep my memory cards so usually there's
three in here but I'm using one right
now as we speak one is in my vlog camera
and then
this is just like a little cartridge to
travel with more erasers these are more
so for when I'm sketching I don't tend
to use pencil when I'm working and then
all of my extra pens pencils markers
basically anything else you can think of
are kept in here so yeah that is the
first drawer and then moving on to the
second drawer and here I just keep this
little three-tier container again is
from Amazon and I'll link it down below
if I can find it and the first one I
keep my portable iPhone charger plus a
bunch of cords for my laptop cameras and
things like that then in the middle I
just keep all the extra white little
clothes pins which I also got from
Amazon and they're for my bulletin board
next I have more clothing pins these are
the ones that actually came with the
bulletin board and I don't really have
use for them yet but I think they're
really pretty so I don't want to get rid
of them and lighters for my candles in
my bedroom and then just behind that I
have my flash drive and then this is
just like a little light-up
Lumi for when you're using your phone I
got this when I went to Coachella
it's from Urban Decay that you clips
onto your phone so last but not least
I'm gonna share with you guys my
bulletin board system above my desk I
actually recently purchased this for a
video so if you guys haven't seen it yet
it's how to get inspired and motivated
I'll put it up on the screen here and
link it so that you guys can definitely
go check that out but just as an overall
at the very top there I have an H&amp;amp;M gift
card that I have yet to use and I also
have this is actually Greg's like
businesses cards so I keep that up there
just because I know I present and
support you know and then I have a bunch
of the photos that I printed up for that
video that are kind of like an in spoke
board and a dream board and then I added
some photos of Greg and I some of Elena
and I and one of Bentley before I ran
out of ink I want to add more photos up
here but I'm gonna have to purchase some
more printer ink but in the meantime
those are just the photos that I have
out there for now it's like a nice sense
of joy when you're working finally if
you're curious about the post-it notes
the orange ones are all the you Tober
videos and the green ones are all my
September videos and how I did it is I
planted all my videos beforehand in this
book here and then once I had all my you
Tober video scheduled in all of my
September videos mapped out I basically
just made a post-it note for every
single one all the September ones down
here and all of the October ones going
up and any time I film a video I take
the post-it note after it's filmed and I
put it down here on my
this lets me know that it's filmed but
not edited and then for instance I just
finished editing this video today so I'm
gonna take this open my agenda and flip
to today's page and then I just stick it
on my agenda to let me know that it's
been edited and completed and then all
my videos that I've edited for the week
will chill on this page and so thus
completes my office tour slash how I
plan it schedule out you Tober and
future videos I hope you guys enjoy this
video inspires you to organize your desk
your closet your bedroom or anything in
some way definitely keep me posted and
tag me in it because I love seeing what
you guys come up with after watching
video it's kind of like you guys inspire
me to come up with this sort of video I
get things ready and organized I film it
for you guys and then it's just like an
ongoing cycle of just constant
motivation and inspiration it brings me
just a colossal amount of joy and other
than that I love you guys I'm gonna back
thank you guys for touring with my desk
with me today so I'm gonna go edit this
video now so I can move that post-it
know into my back guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
