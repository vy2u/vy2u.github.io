that I guess my soul decided to enter
the realm of existence you could say I
was born in February and on a Monday and
I kind of attribute that to maybe why I
like early mornings coffee using my
agenda and all the nerdy things that are
Monday I feel like the universe can kind
of work in mysterious ways that way and
I was also born a Pisces and I tend to
relate a lot to the characteristics of a
Pisces like being a bit more introverted
sensitive and emotional amongst a few
other things I was born into a family of
five which was made up of my dad my mom
my older sister Kirra who was five years
older than me when I was born and then
just a short five years after I was born
my brother came in to complete our
picture it's funny looking back on it
now because we were younger my siblings
and I fought so much but now that we're
older were all like best friends and I'm
super lucky because being the middle
child I'm like you know icing to the
Oreo but I'm also closest to both of
them in age so I get to be super close
with both my siblings and we're all like
best friends speaking of which when I
was younger I was super in to animals
and I actually went vegetarian when I
was 12 and that ended up going vegan in
2013 but I feel like I'm getting a
little bit ahead of myself but as a kid
I absolutely loved animals that was like
my number one thing I was obsessed with
aside for maybe you know clothes and I
always thought I'd grow up to be like a
tree hugger and somehow help the
environment growing up I had a really
good childhood we had so many good
memories and I remember just being super
close with my family even though things
were like not perfect but everything
always felt just safe and comfortable
practically half of my childhood was
spent at my Nana's and Papas house they
were like second parents to me and I
just remember having so many memories
with them growing up it was crazy we
were so close to them we would fake sick
all the time so that we could stay home
from school just to hang out with them
and they would take us to get McDonald's
and we would build birdhouses and go to
the flea market and get goose bumps
books I honestly
some of the coolest grandparents ever
and some of my best memories were made
with them in elementary school I mean I
feel like I had it pretty easy I just
coasted through school and I made some
of actually my best friend still to date
when I was in elementary school but
moving into high school now that was a
little bit of a different story
looking back on high school now I can
remember just trying so hard to be
accepted and to fit in I did have good
memories of high school and mind you I'm
not saying that it was all horrible I
made great memories with some of my
really good friends but a lot of high
school I actually spent very alone and
confused and I actually got bullied
pretty hard in high school too so there
was like a phase I remember where I
would be afraid to go to school even
though I wouldn't want to admit it
because there were times where I'd show
up and things would be written on my
locker I would be like getting in fights
in the hallways it was just so
uncomfortable and this was when I first
started to experience panic attacks I
would have really bad anxiety I got
really bad depression I started to
withdrawal a lot and spend a lot of time
outside of school just in my bedroom or
even just faking sick and skipping
school to stay home and just lay in bed
all day and this was my first experience
with really battling depression but then
grade 11 came around and things started
to change I joined the cheerleading team
in high school and as a mrs. sounds
honestly it was one of those things that
completely changed my year I had so much
fun at my cheer team it felt like such a
little family to me and I just remember
having so much fun with them we were all
so close and going away to cheer
competitions are still some of like my
favorite memories when I think back on
high school so without a doubt grade 11
was my best year between making memories
with friends I also had a serious high
school boyfriend at the time and I was
getting like straight A's until grade 12
came around and pretty much shattered my
entire world it was towards the end of
grade 12 that my dad and my mother
decided to split up I mean if you could
kind of keep and call it that it was a
super messy split unfortunately I think
because there was so much you know toxic
turmoil between the two of them it was
one of those things that we very
unintentionally were stuck in the middle
and
don't think anyone wanted us to be stuck
in the middle but it was just one of
those things that there was really no
other way and so my siblings and I all
kind of felt a little confused and
weren't really sure how to deal with it
because there wasn't really any closure
it was so messy and it kind of still is
messy to this day and so it was then
that I noticed I started skipping
classes I became extremely anxious I was
withdrawing from life and I just
remember feeling so detached I spent so
much time in my bedroom and just didn't
really leave because I didn't know how
to deal with that emotion in that
feeling of like losing that sense of
home in that sense of family I became
this girl in her bedroom and I just
never left I was so socially awkward and
I felt so anxious all the time and
depressed that I just didn't even know
what to do and I was through that that I
started finding things like YouTube and
music and books and if it weren't for
those things I'm not sure how hard I
would have been able to push through
that and so it was from that that I
discovered my love of YouTube and
wanting to capture moments and kind of
highlight the better things in life and
it's so weird looking back that this is
one of the weirdest worst times in my
life but also one of the most pivotal
and I don't think I would be Who I am
today if it wasn't for that portion of
my life in the midst of all of that
going on graduation rolled around and I
graduated from high school and I was
super excited about it because in a
weird way it kind of felt like a new
beginning and I had a chance to kind of
try something new and shake things up so
I graduated with my best friend's I went
to prom I had a really good time and
then that summer I had last-minute
decided to pack up my things and go away
to college I was initially gonna take a
year off but with everything that went
on with my family I just wanted to kind
of escape so I went away to college last
second and followed my high school
boyfriend to the same City he was going
to I ended up going to Conestoga College
where you guys saw my initial dorm tour
which we talked about in a recent video
it was jokes I went for interior
decorating at Conestoga College and this
was actually honestly one of the best
decisions I think I made because of that
course I had to get a DSLR camera so I
started filming videos again I fell in
love with fall that year this is when
the addiction to coffee began like this
year really created a lot of my currents
situation and it was from living alone
that I felt the sense of independence
and I got that space and clarity to kind
of figure out that even though this
wasn't exactly where I needed to be I
started having this weird feeling like
there was something else out there for
me and Kitchener and where I was going
to school wasn't it I decided to move
back home and follow my gut feeling but
I still look back on this portion of my
life and see it as such a huge like kind
of like Awakening and it really did help
me become Who I am but I still felt like
I had to go home and so with that I
packed my things back up went back to
Kingston and decided to get some time
and some space to really decide what I
wanted to do with my life and over that
year I worked at a gym I worked at like
any trician place I hung out with my
friends I made some really good memories
this year was again one of those things
that looking back now I I think my gut
knew that I needed to do it before I
felt like I needed to do it and it was
also in that time that I decided that I
wanted to get a dog and so I picked up
my little fur child Bentley on June 21st
2013 sorry his pictures are so cute oh
my god
that is when I picked up Bentley and his
little you know soul alliance with mine
began shortly after that Thanksgiving
rolled around and my grandparents who
had moved away about 14 hours to PE I
came down for the weekend
and came for Thanksgiving and it was
weird because it was over that time that
my Papa who had battled with his health
most of his life became very sick and
because he was in Kingston we got to
visit him and such in the hospital which
is again one of those weird things that
I feel like the universe had planned
before we did but he ended up passing
away on November 21st 2013 which was
really hard for our family because he
was just like I wish you guys could have
met him he was the coolest wisest person
ever and he was such a huge like
supporter of my youtube used to watch
all my videos and massif on and I still
think about him every day so basically
within one year my parents had split my
Papa had passed away I had gone to
school come home from school and I was
just feeling all kinds of confused I
wasn't sure what was going on what
direction I was heading in and through
all of that confusion I decided to move
out and move into my dad's house he was
also the one that lost his dad
aka my Papa so I was also worried about
him but not only that we were best
friends my my dad was always like my
superhero growing up so was moving in
with him it just it brought me back a
bit more of a sense of comfort again and
it was in the living at his apartment
with him that I actually took on YouTube
full-time and my youtube really started
to take off and I actually got to really
put my passion and my full dedication
into it my dad was also such a huge
supporter and he'd helped me out with
cameras and things like that and I just
got to put all of my focus and my drive
into YouTube and taking it on full-time
and it kind of created this sense of
family online that I felt like I was
kind of missing in real life and it
wasn't too long after that that I
decided to pack up all my things yet
again and move into my very first actual
apartment now this was one of the
apartments you guys can totally check
out on my channel I have so many videos
and stuff of it I moved in with my
boyfriend at the time and this was
honestly one of my favorite apartments
I've lived in because it was just had
such a cozy vibe to it and even though
things started to feel a bit better I
was still dealing a lot with social
anxiety I was getting panic attacks even
worse at this point and my depression
started coming in for longer periods of
the year and so I was still dealing a
lot with that and on the outside even
though I think things seemed totally
okay and in a lot of ways they were on
the inside it was like I was battling
this own kind of war inside my mind
where I still felt like something was
wrong and something was missing and my
emotions weren't fully dealt with or in
check and so it was like the second time
in my life that I had that weird gut
feeling that I wasn't where I was meant
to be but I learned what I needed to
from that point and so like I said this
will always be such a comforting homey
place inside my heart but I decided to
move out and in 2015 I moved into my
second apartment and decided to move in
with my best friend Meg's now if you
guys happen to watch my channel at all
during that time you'll totally know who
I'm talking about
but this was actually honestly still
today one of the best decisions I've
ever made
living with Meggie was so much fun we
were
best friends we never fought at all and
honestly we spent the majority of our
time googling over Justin Bieber Taylor
Swift we'd go for walks and there was
like a Starbucks fireplace and we'd go
get Starbucks and sushi all the time we
lived in our house that was made in the
1860s so we were a hundred percent
haunted but at least we were being
haunted kind of together and that there
were so many centipedes and bugs in this
house but it was so weird because it had
so much character and we had like we
just loved it the majority of our time
was spent drinking new wines we would
watch Netflix
like honestly binge on Netflix have
dance parties make potatoes in every
single form that you could possibly make
a potato so I mean you know it kind of
balanced out being haunted and infested
with bugs it was during this time of
living with Maggie that I went through
some serious like break up some serious
family stuff we both are set like so
much stuff going on all the time though
at the end of the day we would just get
together drink a glass of wine dance
party it out and everything would just
feel so much better and I felt like I
got that like a sense of you know when
you go away to school at University and
you have like your roommate I felt like
I got that from living in this apartment
and kind of like I'd stop speeding up my
life and went back to where I should
have been at the age I was and I think
that's why after living in this
apartment I finally felt like I was
ready to live on my own without anybody
else and so I did just that and spent
the rest of that year traveling and just
kind of like being single living alone
and doing my own thing and just honestly
just taking a breath and figuring out
why I was always feeling like something
was wrong or missing and I think it was
from this moment of solitude even though
things weren't easy and being alone all
the time got hard I think if it wasn't
for that I wouldn't have figured out
that the part that was missing was the
sense of home and security that was no
longer around it was like I was chasing
this feeling of nostalgia and so I
decided that with Kingston no longer
feeling like home I had to go and kind
of create or find a new home and so I
did just that I had always wanted to
move to Toronto but I decided last
second to just jump the gun and do it
packed up my things yet again and came
here I think the whole reason why this
year I felt more myself than I have felt
for so long is because I actually gave
myself the space and the time to kind of
recreate that sense of home within
instead of constantly searching for it
and other people
and in other places and I think looking
back now all of the things that I used
to want to run away from all the happy
memories that I thought were tainted all
of the hardships all of the weird
awkward phases they all kind of melted
into this one almost journey as lame as
that sounds that kind of led me to
exactly where I am right now sitting
here making this voice over making this
video and everything is so deeply
connected and women and so I don't think
you could take out the bad without
taking out the good I read once that
life can only be lived forwards but
understood backwards and I finally
understand what that means I think that
no matter what we're always gonna have
questions but we'll only look back one
day to understand that each and every
move we make every decision we make it's
all just a puzzle piece in our life if
it weren't for things like anxiety and
depression I wouldn't be doing what I do
if it weren't for the people in my life
I wouldn't be Who I am and so I feel
like if it doesn't make sense now one
day it all will and if we constantly
spend our life trying to figure it out
then we'll forget to enjoy it while it's
actually here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
