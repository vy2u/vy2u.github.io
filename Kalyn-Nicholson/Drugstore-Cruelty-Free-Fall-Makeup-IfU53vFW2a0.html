today's video I'm going to be doing a
drugstore cruelty free makeup tutorial
with you guys as you guys know I've been
trying to confer all of my makeup over
to cruelty free and I was really curious
about the drugstore brands and I wanted
to try out some new lip stuff for my
costume and just kind of splurge on some
makeup I was just in the mood so I
brought a list of drugstore cruelty free
brands with me and purchased a bunch of
stuff to do a full face tutorial for you
guys let's jump into this haul toriel so
for foundation I decided to give the
Marcel flawless foundation a try I
picked it up in natural beige it says
it's oil-free all day we're hydrating
hypoallergenic um Auto adapting pigments
skin fusion foundation so I was like
okay not all those things sound like
things that I might enjoy on my face so
I will give it a try as you guys know I
haven't strayed from my Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation almost this entire
year it is like my Holy Grail foundation
it was so weird to put on a different
foundation but that said I think I've
officially found the drugstore dupe for
the born this way because this went on
with like the same amount of coverage
I'm super picky about foundation and I
actually love the way this one turned
out so if you guys are looking for a
dupe to the Born This Way which is also
cruelty free try out the Marcel flawless
because this I'm insanely impressed by
this foundation so for brows I picked up
the Annabelle stay sharp self sharpening
waterproof brow liner I did like it I
don't really have any bad things to say
about it I think I'm just still so
married to like the Tarte mousse right
now that it was weird using a pencil
instead of using like the brush that's
more just personal preference I don't
really like eyebrow crayons as much I
just didn't like obsess over it so for
eyeshadow guys just tell me how perfect
this is I picked up the NYX dream
catcher palette oh I picked up the
golden horizons and just the fact that
it's called the dream catcher palette
was like 99% of the reason why I chose
this one so I ended up using the like
lightest tan color in my crease it was
just like a matte crease and then on top
of that I added this like shimmery it's
like a grey pastel dusty rose color
and then use the very very first like
shimmery champagne all over my lid as
well as my highlight and then to deepen
my crease I went back in with the matte
darker brown NYX is probably like my
favorite John store brand and his
cruelty free it wasn't like super
pigmented or anything but you can build
on it just like most shadows I didn't
get a chance to use like the gold color
in this like this on here but it is
speaking my language and then as for
concealer I got the NYX HD studio
photogenic concealer if I'm being a
hundred percent honest with you guys I
found it to be a little thin ended up
doing two layers of this and I touched
up the second layer just on my dark
circle I just kind of found it a little
bit like oily and thin that said I also
like a super Crispo eye highlights
you're looking for like a heavier
coverage I would definitely recommend
trying something else so to set my
concealer and to contour my face I
picked up the NYX highlight and contour
pro palette so I started with the yellow
toned highlighter to kind of counteract
the purple underneath my eyes and then I
basically mixed it with the ivory to
highlight the rest of my face and then
as for contouring I went in with the
second Brown from the left and used it
to contour my cheekbones of my forehead
underneath my jaw line and then I used
the one just right beside that one right
here onto over my nose so yeah I really
really like this palette I mean from
what I can see on my face it doesn't
look any different than my normal like
highlighting contour and this is so much
cheaper so I might just start purchasing
this now what did I do next
so for eyeliner I decided to try the
super fat eye marker because I was kind
of picturing doing a super dramatic
thick eyeliner and I was wickedly
impressed by this I did not think it was
going to come on that sharp like the
color and the contrast of how dark this
is is insane I definitely thought I was
going to have to layer this a couple
times the only thing I would have to say
about it is to maybe pick up the thinner
one only because I found this one hard
to navigate once I started getting
closer to the inner part of my eye for
mascara I
decided to give two different ones a try
on two different eyes to see which one I
ended up liking more so on this eye here
I actually did the Annabelle supernova
mascara and then on this eye I used the
enema blast-off mascara it's funny
because I definitely thought I was going
to like the blast-off more since the
brush sort of reminded me of my old
favorite Maybelline mascara but the
supernova totally went out on me like
like it just took my lashes to the next
level it was insane so out of the two I
think I'll definitely be repurchasing
the Annabelle supernova also just to
make a good disclaimer this video is not
being sponsored by anyone or anything at
all these are all just like my genuine
honest opinion I have been wanting to
try the NYX like liquid lipsticks for so
long now and I just don't I have no
excuse as to why I haven't I've just
been way too lazy to go pick them up
so I gave two different ones a try the
first one I tried was the NYX lingerie
and this is in the color Teddy and I am
obsessed with how this turned out both
of these are super matte they're super
like they go on so easily I love the
application brushes in both of these I
just think there's no I have no bad
words to speak of either of these things
teddy was probably my favorite out of
the two colors only because I've been
super into the like more brown toned
lipsticks lately but I then tried the
NYX liquid suede and this is a cream
lipstick and I got an invented that's
the one I'm wearing right now amulets I
don't know again I just have nothing bad
to say about it it's so smooth and like
mattes and just everything I thought it
was going to be and I'm so impressed so
that was it for my cruelty-free haul
torial I hope you guys enjoyed if you
guys want to see more videos like this
then just thought of this up because I
was noticed I'm getting like super into
makeup again lately and I kind of fell
out of that phase for a while but I
don't know what it is lately I've just
been super obsessed with like Charlie
lip colors and like just trying new
things on my face why there's been a lot
more makeup tutorials than usual so yeah
if you guys want to see like more haul
toriel's more makeup tutorials more
drugstore more cruelty free anything
like that then just thumbs us up or let
me know down below and other than that I
love you guys to do a moon and back and
