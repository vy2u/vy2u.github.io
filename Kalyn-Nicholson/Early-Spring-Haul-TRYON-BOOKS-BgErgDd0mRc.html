my channel for today's video I'm going
to be doing a massive haul with you guys
it's been a while since I've done a haul
video I actually I'm not gonna lie I've
been pretty proud of myself I feel like
I've really kind of crunched down on my
very insistent habit on over shopping
around the fall time I started getting
them really into like budgeting my money
but that said for that reason I had a
little bit of money tucked away that I
knew I wanted to kind of splurge on for
my birthday month I'm one of those
people that like on my actual birthday
I'm like no stuff but the whole month
I'm like it's my birthday I can do
whatever I want so for that reason I
kind of splurged a little bit and I
decided to pull it all together into a
haul video and share with you guys some
of the stuff that I've been loving
lately
some of the clothing I've been kind of
inspired by and just all that fun jazz
really quick if you guys aren't
following me already I'm gonna pop my
Twitter my Instagram and my blog right
here on the screen come check it out
this time I'm out let's just go right
ahead and jump in because I have a lot
to show you guys and we have to try it
all on so sit down stay a while we've
got a lot we've got a lot to show
so I told you guys already that I wanted
to try and do one book related video
every single month and from February I
was debating doing kind of like a book
related video all about love stories but
to be honest with you I haven't read a
good good old love story in a long time
so instead I kind of took that
inspiration and decided to go book
shopping I picked up three books the
other day Greg and I went to chapter is
the colors of them totally go with
everything that's in this haul know that
that's important but apparently we've
got like a theme going on so first
things first I picked up a new mug I was
actually drinking coffee out of this
this morning so forgive me if you see
some coffee stains but I picked up this
mug here from chapters I'm loving the
color of it hose is actually gonna be
coming up with a mug almost identical to
this color I've been so drawn to this
color lately that when I walked into
chapters and I saw this I was like yes
and it says namaste
in bed which yeah yoga but also yoga in
bed that's kind of dirty you know what I
mean and if you can't find it then hold
tight because the collection that's
going live on COEs with the whole COEs
makeover going on right now
I will hint that there will be a mug in
this color I've been kind of in the mood
to read a love story and one of the
books that I have added to my reading
list this safe haven so that's a
Nicholas Sparks book but I already had
safe haven but I decided to add these
two books they were both six dollars
they were on the sale table the first
book is called since you've been gone
and it looks like spring and it says how
do you learn to love again in one tragic
moment Holly's life as she knew it
changed forever now in the external
world at least she's finally getting
back on her feet running her bakery cake
but inside she's still going through the
motions of being a 27 year old widow and
she meets Kieran Argyle his privileged
and charmed life feels a million miles
from her own however there's more to
kuren than the superficial world that
surrounds him and he too is wrestling
with his own ghosts well Holly find the
missing ingredient that allows her to
live life again and embrace an unknown
and unexpected tomorrow so I feel like
this is just a really
but kind of transitioning into the
spring /summer time and also I do have
some trips coming up so I think that
this will be a good love story to read
and then the other book I picked up is
called enough about love and this book
says Anna and Louise could be sisters
but they don't know each other both are
married with children and for the most
part they are happy enough in their
relationships on almost the same day and
acrosses paths with writer eyes and
Louise meets Anna's analyst Thomas their
lives are unexpectedly turned upside
down by the delicious and convenient
arrival of love but they're passionate
Affairs come at a high price
thought-provoking and sophisticated and
above all amusing enough about love
captures the áfourá
of desire through tender and unflinching
portraits of husbands wives and lovers
so it's from a French author it was on
the sale rack and it just I did it kind
of soon at the Valentine's Day vibe so I
decided to pick this one up as well and
then the last book I picked up from
chapters this is a nonfiction I decided
to give unplug to try this is one of the
ones that was like pics from the people
that work at chapters a simple guide to
meditation for busy skeptics and modern
soul seekers one I feel like this is
going to be small enough meditation book
to kind of travel with - I needed to add
more to my nonfiction list if you didn't
see my nonfiction book list for 2018 I
will put it down below or pop it up on
the screen but I've added this to the
list now and also as you guys know I've
been getting super into meditation I
feel like I'm just scratching the
surface of it honestly I have such a
hunger right now to learn so much about
it so seeing this book that decided to
pick it up now we're getting to the good
stuff
I bought a few things off of ASOS and
the first I hope I'm saying that right
but the first thing I picked up was this
t-shirt here I've been really into logo
tees and I feel like getting back into
that spring weather even though I'm
looking outside and there is an actual
snowstorm going on right now thinking
about spring and thinking about kind of
spring/summer whether I'm gonna
attracting it I've been trying to get it
to come faster it's not working she feel
like having good classic logo tees you
can't go wrong and when I saw this one I
just felt like I needed to get it it's
actually by the brand Wrangler and I
have a Jeep Wrangler so when I saw this
I was like yep throw in like a leather
jacket and some jeans and you just like
you're good to go and then the next
thing I picked up this was like this was
my splurge in this haul okay I feel like
I need to justify it I saw this raincoat
and I could not for the life of me get
myself to take it out of my cart you
shouldn't spend that much you don't need
a raincoat it's still snowing outside I
just I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't
not have it exist in my life it's
basically just this baby pink oh my god
guys this nothing has ever felt more
right I got a half of aces but it's from
Love Machine oh I hope I said that right
- it's like light enough that it's gonna
be perfect for the spring like I
honestly I feel like I just want to wear
this the rest of the hall it's so pretty
life is too short to not you know burn
your candles and wear your expensive
rain jacket for the reason that it's
like kind of loud I'll take it off but
I'm obsessed also I recently went to
Sport Chek and while I was there I
decided to pick up a sweater and some
headbands this is the sweater I got from
Nike it's just this like crop sweater
you can tie it at the bottom to make it
tighter it's like a mixture between baby
pink and baby purple which again has
been just suiting the whole vibe and so
I decided to pick it up and then the
other thing I decided to pick up while I
was there to our headbands because I'm
in the middle of like that awkward stage
of growing up my bag
and so every time I go running or do
yoga my bangs fall out of my ponytail
like they're threatening to right now
picked up some Nike headbands this is
kind of keep my bangs back but also
these are cute enough that they fit all
of like my workout stuff right now and
recently when I was in my hometown I
decided to check out Urban Outfitters
and while I was there I picked up two
things the first thing I picked up was
another book this is practical magic a
beginner's guide to crystals horoscopes
psychics and spells I've just been like
super into this kind of stuff lately I
feel like it's so interesting and cool
to learn about it goes into like all the
flowers it goes into tarot cards it goes
into chakras it goes into reading
people's auras and what color they are
just all of that cool kind of like moody
vibey stuff and then the other thing I
decided to pick up while I was there was
this coat this jacket was in the sales
section for an additional 40% off so I
ended up getting this coat for like 30
bucks so it was the last one and it's
like three sizes too big but I feel like
that's kind of what gives it it's you
know charm like I like that it's super
oversized and so comfy because then I
just feel like I feel like I'm drowning
in it it's like I look like I'm wearing
a cloud I am wearing a cloud
the next story I'm going to share with
you guys is forever 21 and I have a lot
a lot to share with you guys from here
since I'm already sharing jackets one of
the jackets I decided to pick up from
forever 21 is this one here it's almost
like a fake suede moto jacket in this
nice tan color it kind of suits the
whole vibe we've been going for lately
but it's also super comfy I like buying
kind of trendy or things from forever 21
in case it's something that kind of goes
out of style really quickly because then
you didn't spend $300 on a raincoat the
next kind of going with the shirt that
I'm wearing right now I decided to pick
up this shirt from forever 21 it's just
got to saturn's over your boobs like can
we just take a second I don't know why
but I love this it's just so cute I feel
like I'm gonna wear this a lot and this
one see this one's also from forever 21
the next thing I have to share with you
guys is this shirt here this is just
like a cropped polka dot shirt feel like
you could wear this with like
high-waisted jeans or you could wear it
there's so many ways you could wear this
too and the polka dots I feel like just
scream spring so I've been also just
loving cropped teased with like
high-waisted vintage esque jeans kind of
matches the vibe of this romper that I
picked up which is just a black and
white polka-dot loi romper I'm normally
not so much of a polkadot person but
this year I feel like I could maybe roll
with it I think it's such a cute pattern
for springtime and rompers like this are
so easy like with like a little Sun Hat
or some cute booties I wish it wasn't
snowing outside so I could actually be
wearing these things I got this matching
set of workout gear so the bottoms they
almost kind of look like marble and
they're in a lilac baby pink like that's
a mini kind of color there's a bit of
baby blue in there these ones are
high-waisted but they're also cropped at
the bottom and then I got the matching
sports bra to go with it already kind of
had a pretty good collection of clothes
for running now that I've been getting
more into yoga I wanted so I'm just like
cute matching little like yoga gear to
wear to do yoga and since we're talking
about work over here I'll show you the
rest of the workout stuff I got to
I also picked up the
leggings I thought that these would be
cool there's like ombre black to white
again they're cropped and I feel like
these could be really good for running
or yoga like they're more versatile this
year I'm gonna get really into styling
more workout gear so it's not something
you guys want to see then definitely let
me know down below and I also decided to
pick up this cropped mesh I wouldn't
even call this a sweater because it
really doesn't like it doesn't do
sweater things but it's just like a nice
little top to go over if you're wearing
a sports bra to yoga or if you're just
like like when I do yoga here sometimes
this room gets really cold because
there's so many windows in it so I'll
just kind of wear this over top for the
first little bit until my muscles kind
of warm up plus it's just really cute
and again it's in that salmon color that
is invading and taking over my life I
think this might be a new theme of
clothing that you're gonna start seeing
me wear a bit more these like comfy
baggy I don't know why but I want to
call these brunch pants and just feel
like these are the types of pants you
would wear to a brunch now on we're
calling these brunch pants okay so I
decided to pick up these pinstripe
brunch pants and they're in navy and
white and they have this big giant
massive bow in the front this is one of
those things where from forever 21 you
put it on your like this is majestic I
can't believe this is from forever 21
with a good body suit or crop top in the
spring it's gonna be perfect
this might be one of my favorite things
in this entire haul it's just like
massive and oversized and even the
sleeves kind of have like a boxy fit to
them it's so soft and the color is
incredible I kind of wish I had picked
up another one so warm this is something
you can actually wear considering it is
still winter out and then guys I got the
cutest pair of matching pajamas can we
can we just are those avocados why yes
they are I saw this on forever 21 and I
thought it was so cute so the shirt says
let's all bow cuddle and then the shorts
are baby pink with actual legitimate
avocados on them well not legitimate
avocados but you know what I'm saying
the only pajamas I own are shorts
and so I just couldn't I couldn't say no
to this plus I feel like Greg is going
to chirp me so hard when he sees these
it's gonna be hilarious okay there's
only two things left to show from
forever21
the first one I decided to finally pick
up my first pair of overalls I wasn't
sure if I'd be able to rock it and
suddenly I'm just feeling like this
spring is gonna be the debut of overalls
coming back into my life I used to wear
overalls all the time as a kid I picked
up this pair from forever 21 they're
actually so cute I was again shocked
that these are from forever 21 because
they fit so nicely so this is gonna be
this is like my clothing challenge for
springtime is styling the overalls
that's the little challenge that I'm
giving myself and then last but not
least I picked this up I decided to grab
this like it's super thin be really good
for like running but at the same time I
kind of feel like you know those
potatoes you buy that are already
wrapped in tin foil and ready to go in
the oven that's what I feel like right
now I actually really do like this
jacket I feel like it's very far out of
my comfort zone but that's why I'm kind
of diggin it again it's kind of like a
challenge for me to find a way to rock
this and style it just like we're all
black underneath kind of thing like a
really dope pair of sunglasses I feel
like this could look pretty cool and
then last but not least the last store I
have to show you guys is sho PO I
recently picked up a few things from
there the first thing is another pair of
brunch pants these ones are in that like
really pretty mo color this is like a
nice white bodysuit is going to look so
bomb in the warmer weather also all of
these clothes make me want to just go to
Paris I feel like these are all perfect
Paris clothes I decided to pick up these
brunch pants they're super stretchy on
the top super just like loose and breezy
and then it's really cool because they
have the slit that goes up the side so
it kind of looks like you're wearing a
maxi skirt but you're actually wearing
bridge pants I love that we're calling
these brunch pants now I feel like I
don't know I just feel like brunch pants
are gonna be the new thing the next hop
I decided to pick up from show PO I
actually wore it so you'll have to
excuse the little bit of makeup on there
it's kind of like a mixture between a
sports bra and like an everyday shirt
it's just super comfy it's kind of got
like a low back scoop and it's a little
longer than a normal sports bra so you
can get away with wearing it as a top
two and this top will go good with
brunch pants I just want any excuse
right now to see brunch pants which is
nice because the next thing I have to
share
you guys is another pair of brunch pants
this is the last and final pair of
brunch pants I have to share with you
guys in this hall at least I picked up
this Navy pair from show PO with these
kind of like soft salmon e and tan
floral design going on again they kind
of fit the whole aesthetic and vibe of
the whole haul but also these ones are
so comfy they have a big bow in the
front and I just feel like I could eat a
really good stack of vegan waffles in
these pants next I decided to pick up
another set of matching workout gears so
this one is pink with these leaves or
like branches in another pink and white
color oh these ones are also
high-waisted these are super high
waisted and they go all the way down to
your ankle and then again the matching
sports bra to just go with it
perfect for yoga I wouldn't necessarily
run in these because I just feel like
they're too pretty I mean you could run
in it I just like I sweat like a hog the
next thing I got from show PO is another
basic tee this one's just white it's a
super nice material actually it's like
stretchy and it almost has that dry wick
feel to it and then in black it just
says messy which I just thought was cute
for like a pair of jeans or like a
really chill kind of casual day maybe
tied up and a knot throw some brunch
pants on go to brunch this is making me
really hungry for like pancakes next and
second last thing I have to share with
you guys in this haul is this top that I
got from show PO this is so cute I
cannot wait to wear this the stitching
detailing it's in this really really
pretty kind of cream color with grey and
pink flowers and you can tie a bow as
tight as you want it in the back and I
just feel like these are so kind of the
vibe that I've been feeling lately and
then the last thing I have to share with
you guys which you can even wear with
that top is this skirt it's this skirt
that I've been wanting to pick up from
show PO for so long they've had it on
their website for some time now and
every time I see it I like fangirl over
it so finally I just bit the bullet and
bought it ties up on to the side and
then it's just like flowy and it kind of
has like layers to it pushed it myself
in the face just recently cleared out my
closet if you guys watched my life
makeover vlog last week so now that I
cleared those out of like
that I felt the need to kind of start
restocking with a few maxi skirts that I
actually really like thus concludes
everything I purchased for this little
birthday month haul I guess you might
