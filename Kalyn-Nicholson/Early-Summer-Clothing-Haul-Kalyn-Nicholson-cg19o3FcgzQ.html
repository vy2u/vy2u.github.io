airport in 45 minutes so I'm really
cutting this video close like ah oh my
god okay shall we do this let's do this
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I am doing
an early summer slash late spring haul I
haven't done a haul video with you guys
and so long it's kind of ridiculous and
I bought a bunch of stuff recently to
like completely revamp my closet I'm
doing this thing where every time I buy
something I'm not allowed to buy more
hangers or make more space my closet I
have to donate something to put
something else in its place and so I was
kind of going through my closet the
other day and there's some stuff I love
but there's some stuff that I honestly
don't wear anymore so I was like you
know what I haven't done the whole video
and very long time so why not I'm going
to try and find the links to as many
things as possible and leave them down
below for you guys if you guys wanna
shop out of the things that I bought
because I bought some pretty wicked
things then definitely go check out this
link also quick disclaimer my back door
is open and I'm currently drying things
in my washer and dryer so if you guys
hear like the ticking of the zipper or
you know the honking of horn I apologize
and also really quick if you guys are
following me already be sure to check
out all my social links down below and
come check out my Orlando trip because
by the time you're seeing this I'm
probably in Orlando stock my snapchat
because I'm really weird on snapchat so
okay let's do this she'll be there for
stores to show you guys Sahra Lola
Shoetique IRISA and Lulu's um this one's
going to be a little bit more of like a
pricey haul but if you guys want me to
do a spring/summer shop with me like
spend a certain budget and show you guys
how you can completely revamp your
wardrobe on a budget to that firm 21 all
that let me know because I love to shop
so give me the incentive and I will do
it jump it I'm going to do a risky up
first so I went too risky Oh recently
picked up a bunch of stuff first things
first I picked up these shorts I'm
actually bringing these with me to
Orlando for my Meetup I think I'm going
to wear these there there are these
looks are like almost like trouser
shorts I don't know if that's the right
word I'm looking for but they are
adorable they're so
they fit so well they're so flattering
they were a little bit more pricey that
I had wanted but I have a gift card to
ryssia and so I was like you're right
and these like once I tried them on I
was like I know I'm going to wear these
probably like a million times or like
high-waisted and they have cute little
pockets they just remind me of something
like Taylor Swift to wear and I think
they're just adorable wearing them with
like a white crop top for my meet up and
she's little booties next I picked out
this dress I have a dress very similar
to it I picked up recently from
arrhythmia and gray and so I went back
and I saw that they had a new design of
it but it's in black and y'all know how
much I'd love to wear black pretty much
every day so I picked it up this is what
it looks like here it's the material is
so comfy and super stretchy see like
running cut out here and then like your
major credit shows and then it just goes
down into a fish fluffy like all over
these clothes Wow so that is what it
looks like and then it just goes down
into a normal like dress good staple and
they have them in a bunch of colors so I
highly recommend checking them out I
also got it in grey and next I think I'm
gonna wear these on the plane but I
picked up these like army green like
just baggy baggy pants like federally
got explaining material is the focus
cause um this is really calm though so
they're just like these baggy army green
just like comfy pants and I feel like
this was really good for traveling and
also just in general I was thinking I'm
going to wear this with like a black
bodysuit and I kind of love that like
sporty edgy but still chic kind of look
so I feel like these are perfect for
that it's all Bella Hadid wearing an
outfit where she wore pants similar to
this I thought Cady heron where an army
pants and flip-flops so I bought all new
pants and flip-flops was like a black
crop top and like a leather jacket over
and I was like I love that channeling my
inner Bella habited you know and then
the last thing I picked up from Marisa I
ended up donating a bunch of my old
cardigans because I didn't really like
like the style or fit of them anymore so
I needed to pick up a few new one and
this is the one that I picked up it's
kind of like a t-shirt style one so it's
good for the spring and summer time I
hold up the clothes my exposure just
goes all that salt and pepper dark grey
and it's so comfy and just like baggy
and stretchy and just the cutest thing
ever
you could also wear this was just like
black
two dresses or over like rompers one
stop on chilly night so that was
everything I got from Arabia next I'm
going to show you guys and stuff I got
some Lola Shoetique first thing I picked
up with this dress here and I'm actually
obsessed like this is the cutest thing I
think I have in my closet now cereal is
insane
like distractor super stretchy and the
material itself is super stretchy I was
a little bit weary when picking it out
because I was like what if it's way too
tight and honestly it's like impossible
because the material is so stretchy it's
like it just rolled I'm a bit bigger
busted for my body side does is in top
like this where it's got like a deep v
cut tends to kind of scare me it but
there's really good structure in this
and supporting it absolutely looks
amazing when you try it on it just like
holds the girls up in place and it's
just like body con and you it's just so
cute and I love like the floral
detailing down the front and next you'll
notice that there's going to be a bit of
like a street you notice is it's gonna
be a bit of like a jean jacket theme
going on
I have four now I got four I have one
cardigan before jean jackets tell me how
that make sense I saw this on the
website and it needed a get you needed
to be mocking it so it's this cute like
light wash jean jacket and it's got
these like floral detailing all over it
it is the communit thing I was just like
do I even really need to explain mess up
it's so friggin cute I love my other
jean jacket but like the floral
detailing on this it just does not go
well with my Metallica t-shirt but look
at it
I feel like I don't have to explain
myself at this one my suitcase is gonna
be so close to the next thing I picked
up okay I feel like people already
they're going to think these are super
ugly or super cute but are these booties
right here I think it's all about how
you style these but I picked up these
booties from Lola Shoetique it's got
like this floral like detailing all over
them and I think these are really keep
your spring especially was like an
all-black outfit or really cute jeans
and a jacket it's like two months ago I
would have called these the ugliest
things on planet Earth so the next özil
of rocking a pair of Coachella they're
kind of like cowboy style in the front
if you guys can tell
um but yeah they're adorable I love them
you guys want me to do like a lookbook
record show you guys I'm stylus buy the
stuff I can totally do that really kind
of pushing myself to wear things I
secretly want to wear but I'm going to
sit like too afraid to do it I think
life's too short to wear boring clothes
you want to wear spiky clothes somewhere
expensive clothes melt and dryers
actually really long because I want to
like shut it off I should shut the door
whatever there we go so next I picked up
a pair of these black jean shorts and
they have this like really cute lace-up
detailing on the front and then the
metal around it is like a rose gold
color
here's a new pair of black pink shorts
so those are the choice that I picked up
from Lola and then last but not least I
picked up this shirt which kind of goes
well with some shorts actually but it's
like this big baggy like this stress
pinky dusty rose shirt took with the
longest description ever and then down
the sides of the shoulders of it it has
like this again I don't know why I'm
just obsessed with lace detailing
between lace stuff and floral it's like
the theme of this haul really quickly
kind of split up all the little places I
was actually just at Shoppers Drug Mart
picking up some stuff for my trip and I
ran into knodel I like bumps into the
table that had this bag in it and I was
like holy hot damn okay so I started
looking at it and there's like Vegas
thing says vent area slash vegan if a
bag could be your soul mate I think I
found mine and I'm the really cool thing
about this bag too is it comes with a
strap to I cook up on to here but then
you can also hold it over like a clutch
or there's a little bag inside and you
can use that as well
eleven ways to you would use these bags
like redesign them and like repurpose
them and restyle them um that's amazing
and I love the studs on them they're
just so like rocker chic and so I needed
a new bag and I was like no way if it's
vegan as if you can wear it so many
different ways and I complete a smaller
one it was just meant to be honestly a
brand is nella Bella by tarik and if I
could find the link to it I'll leave it
down below because this is going to be
such a friggin staple for me so next I
got shares you guys the stuff I picked
up from Zara there's only
dings don't worry okay nice and quick
the first thing I picked up are these
pants here actually saw okay we talked
about Bella habit MELAS quit Gigi had it
I thought a picture of Gigi Hadid
wearing pants pretty similar to this
where it has like the like rigid
detailing along the knees again
channeling my energy jihad is out I only
have one other pair of like black pants
that are Jean this is more of like a
stretchy it kind of is like Jean but
it's like they're more jeggings slash
stretchy and so I feel like you could
still wear this with a jean jacket
without looking like Justin to really in
pretty serious that war time no one will
ever let them forget so I decided to
pick these up they were only $40 was
relatively cheap and they've got like
little different pockets and again I
just feel like you can dress these up or
you can make them super casual it was
just going to like brunch or whatever
here in Canada now it's starting to get
into spring summer weather we still get
these days like today where it drops
down so having a good pair of like pants
that are comfy but also stylish is top
notch you need it next I decided to pick
up a new one-piece bathing - I've never
really digging the one pieces this year
you know leaving Lord of the imagination
and also just like I don't know what it
is about a one-piece peeking through
Instagram you see a girl like rocking a
stick one piece you're like yes so I
think this one that from stars like a
very different than what I would
normally wear I'm normally more of like
a red one-piece or a black one piece or
like just a solid color so figured why
not try something different and pick up
this like tropical looking like eye a
low back which is super nice and then
again I don't know what it is guys but
at least up detailing along the sides on
each side of it and then like I said
there's like a jean jacket theme going
on here but I picked up this jean jacket
from Zara and out of the Y's like it
gives me some Michael Jackson sighs I
think it's honestly the like popped up
shoulder and I like that it's cropped so
if you're looking for something that's
going to kind of give you a bit more
shape like around your waistline I find
my other ones they're so big and baggy
and cute they're very like 90s and so
this one is a little bit more like she
also has a bunch of distress like
detailing on it which I love if any sort
of jean jacket so and the last but not
least when they shared you guys the
stuff that I got from Lulu's but I
literally just picked up from the post
like 50 minutes ago so first things
first I picked up this robber it kind of
again got that trouser or like I'm going
to know how to describe this very like
Indiana Jones and my dealing with that
maybe maybe that's just me and it's just
with a little romper it's got a tie at
the waist so you can like cinch it if
you need to again I just thought this
could be really cute with a jean jacket
and the right pair of shoes slash
booties and this would be something you
could dress up or dress down on the next
exit doesn't body to and I realized here
we are again with another lace tub
detail so this would be really really
nice just to spice up your average black
bodysuit and I like to cut around the
front of it so this could be really cute
with just a pair of jeans or if you
paired it with like a cute skirt can
wear it smell many different ways and I
find you can never have too many bottoms
do such a good staple to have no matter
what you wear so the next I picked up
this t-shirt dress it's just like a
charcoal gray with the front pocket
pretty standard nice and casual again
you can pair it with the jean jacket or
a good leather jacket if you want to
spice it up kind of got this
fit-and-flare style at the bottom and if
you like the t-shirt dress is something
you need to have in the spring it's just
so still versatile it's so comfortable I
might even wear this on the plane some
of the other outfit so you can never go
wrong if you like buying a t-shirt dress
is always money well spent
so next without a doubt my favorite
thing that I think I picked up from Lulu
this but it is this maxi it's not going
to do it justice but it's like a teal
blue and it's got like this hide Isis
splits down the front and a tie around
the waist this is so friggin cute like
it goes on like this cinches around your
waist and then the bottom and just like
flowy and the squat flip so you can just
like do that little like leg peekaboo
I'm so like just black dress and a jean
jacket so I really want to push myself
to start wearing some more like dramatic
pieces like this next this is probably
my second favorite thing in this whole
haul I picked up this vegan leather
floral jacket can we take a second all I
think about when I see this jacket is
like the hands praise god bless
definitely gonna be bringing this with
me it's vegan leather it's got like
studs and floral like I said it will
obsessed with the floral idea and small
is one of the more pricey things that I
picked up but this is so worth it
because I know
where it so much the next day I picked
up this bathing suit again it's another
one piece just a standard black one but
it's also one of those one pieces that
you could wear as a bodysuit if you
needed to and it's got like the padding
so figure about some people like me
don't us to worry about it and I love
bathing suits like this so they have
like a sticker strap because again I
find it gives you just more support you
know what I'm going to pass this in my
suitcase right now I can see the residue
splashing and I'm like don't die only
have two more things to show you guys it
feels kind of like slave material but
it's not real slave and it is this
jacket here you know what I'm gonna chat
on again for you guys I just let the
disappea super cute I don't really have
a jacket in this color and I love this
color for spring it's almost like a
mixture between a cardigan and a jacket
it's nice it's Lily it's got like
pockets on the side so I feel like I'm
gonna wear this a lot again with my
dresses rompers so that is the taupe
jacket that I picked up and then last
but not least I picked up a pair of
boobies they're like these cowboy style
they have like all of this that is
detailing this would look super cute
with a leather jacket that I would just
showed you guys it's like a chain going
underneath the heel and like this cowboy
like stitching on the front so there's
really cute black again they're vegan
leather this is also my shoe soulmate
it's like the perfect combo of kind of
edgy but chic at the same time and I
wish I had these for Coachella they
would have been perfect guys I love
everything I got so that was it for my
early spring summer haul and I didn't
get a chance to try it all on three guys
I highly apologize but I plan on doing a
look book with all the lip stuff so
definitely watch out for that if you
guys want it sooner than later just sums
this off for let me know down below and
I can post it in the next week or two
see if I could see what all this stuff
looks like on let me know down below
which item on your favorite I think for
me it was either the leather jacket the
boots oh my god I just loved everything
so that is it I hope you guys enjoyed it

I will see you guys all in a future
