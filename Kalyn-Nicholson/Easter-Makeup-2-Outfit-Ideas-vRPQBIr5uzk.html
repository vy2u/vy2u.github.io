to be doing some Easter makeup and two
different outfit ideas even if you don't
celebrate Easter this is still a really
fun makeup look and two different outfit
looks for the springtime so you could
wear it for Easter even after Easter or
before Easter and I also just recently
uploaded my new music Monday playlist so
I'll go ahead and link that down below
if you guys are looking to listen to
some new music also if you guys decide
to recreate the make up look or either
of the outfit looks in this video be
sure to tweet an Instagram that looks at
me so I can check them out for myself so
other than that if you guys are looking
for some makeup and outfits inspiration
for Easter then just keep watching so to
start I'm going in with my Olay fresh
effects mattifier since I find it helps
get rid of a little bit of some redness
and also minimizes some of my pores and
then I'm going in with my covergirl
trublend foundation and blending this
all in I know it looks a little bit more
yellow toned than my actual skin but it
matched the rest of my body better and
then I'm just going in with my concealer
and blending that all into place
so to set everything into place I'm
using my Too Faced primed and poreless
but you can use any pressed powder you
like and then to set my brows into place
as well I'm doing my makeup forever aqua
brow senses is my all-time favorite brow
product but again you guys can use your
all-time favorite brow product as well
and I'm just shaping out my brows
without making them too defined and then
I'm just taking my birthday cake lip
chap to get my lips ready for some
lipstick and in the meantime I'm going
to be taking my covergirl palette and
the taupe color the matte taupe color
that you just saw and blending that into
my crease then taking the lightest color
on a damp brush and putting this on the
front corner because it adds a lot of
vibrancy and then in the middle I'm
popping the second metallic color just
to add a nice transitional color
I'm then pulling that second color along
the bottom a bit as well as the first
highlight color on underneath my brows
as a highlight then I'm going in with my
covergirl bloom mascara and adding a
couple coats to this own of my lashes
and today I decided to try a coral look
on my lips so I'm using Revlon's coral
berry with just an Annabelle nude lip
liner underneath and I decided to go
with like a corally orange color because
it matched both outfits and just because
I find it's a nice change for the spring
and such a spring color so those are key
colors that I'm putting on my lips
now to bronze and contour i'm using my
NYC smooth skin since it's nice and
affordable and it gets the job done so
i'm just contouring out my cheekbones as
well as some other areas that i want to
add a bit of a contour and then for
blush I'm going in with my Annabelle
blush because it is a Coralie color I
thought it would add a nice other touch
of coral to our face and play off the
lips and just for fun I decided to rock
some lashes but again that is optional
so far our casual look I decided to put
a 2-piece on and just throw a little
kimono or a little cardigan over top
nice and casual but still very springy
with a little pair of booties and a
brown bag
and for those of you who get a little
bit more dressed up for Easter Sunday I
decided to put this really spring
florally dress on with a little cardigan
for those of you that are in a colder
spot and then a hat and a cute pop of
color purse all outfit details will be
below and I'll see you guys on my future
