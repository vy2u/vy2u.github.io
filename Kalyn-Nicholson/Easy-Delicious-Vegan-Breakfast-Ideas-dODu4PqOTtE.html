bringing back Fitness Friday I feel like
I haven't made a Fitness Friday video
and so flippin long and it gets it
requested so much so I figured I would
go ahead and film anyone for you guys
fret not I am not getting rid of Fitness
Friday they are just going to be um not
as frequent I guess like they're gonna
I'm just going to throw them up every
once in a while on a random Friday you
know what I mean
okay cool so for today's video some of
this Fitness Friday is not as fit as you
might think but long story short it has
been so highly requested from you guys
that I make more vegan style videos like
vegan meal ideas breakfast ideas snack
ideas and all that fun stuff so I'm
going to do a full like kind of series I
guess you could say we're we're gonna
just go through every single possible
thing you could think of and I'm just
going to show you a bunch of really good
ideas so the look on this episode one of
the vegan food series and today we're
going to be talking about vegan
breakfast I just took a bunch of
favorite breakfast foods and made them
vegan for you guys to show that
literally you can eat pretty much
anything as a vegan you just got to find
the substitutes so if you guys want to
find out some really really easy and
yummy vegan Bently not yet put Wilber
down put Wilber down Bently so if you
guys want to find some vegan
alternatives to your favorite breakfast
meals or you're just looking for
breakfast ideas in the morning then just
keep watching
okay so starting with the basics
obviously you're going to want to have
your coffee in the morning for those of
you that do drink coffee I'm just going
to share with you guys really quickly
like my favorite way of making my coffee
in the morning for those who that might
not know so this so delicious dairy-free
coconut creamer I get it in french
vanilla and literally you don't even
have to add sweetener to it it's the
best thing ever that you will ever put
in your coffee you can make lattes
mochas and a bunch of stuff with this
and then my go-to breakfast usually is
toast so for those of you guys that
might think you're missing out on toast
and butter if you go vegan it is not the
case so I like to make this Dempster's
like ancient grains toast or whatever
and then for those of you that don't
know base L actually has a vegan
margarine so that is what I use and I
just go ahead and put that on toast and
that is usually my go-to breakfast most
mornings or if I'm feeling like spicing
it up or if you don't really like toast
and butter you could also just put on
some tomatoes some salt and pepper and
make yourself a vegan toasted tomato
so if you're not much of a toast person
if you prefer bagels well you can also
still stick with your bagel and cream
cheese so my favorite type of bagel is
everything bagels so I just went ahead
and toasted one of those
to
and as for cream cheese daya actually
has a vegan style chive and onion cream
cheese that I recently purchased and
decided to give it a try now I find this
pretty good it's not the same thing as
cream cheese but it is pretty good
alternative for those of you guys that
feel like you're missing out but if I am
going to be a hundred percent honest
with you guys
I much prefer just putting hummus on my
bagel so if you don't really like the
daya cream cheese just go for like a
garlic hummus put this on your bagel it
might sound weird but it's actually one
of the most delicious breakfast
absolutely ever
pushy
like a van
that shoes
so when I asked on Instagram what
breakfast is you guys wanted to see a
smoothie Bowl came up quite a bit so I'm
going to share with you guys how I make
my favorite orange creamsicle smoothie
so all you're gonna need is orange juice
some frozen bananas and some frozen
strawberries then just go ahead and
blend that up and what other whatever
consistency you please if you prefer to
drink it as a smoothie by all means go
right ahead but I like to make my
smoothies a little bit thicker and eat
it as if it's kind of like ice cream
want you
so then once it's blended I just put it
in a bowl and sometimes I'll add some
fresh fruit like berries or bananas or
whatever I have on me and then another
thing that I like to add are these like
organic chai seeds it's got like a bunch
of different types of seeds and stuff in
there and I will just sprinkle that on
top
throw a spoon in and you're ready to go
it's just super easy and yummy smoothie
Bowl so the next thing I'm going to show
you guys is going to be this really cool
tofu scramble so this is something that
I don't make regularly because it is a
lot of work but for Sunday's or on the
weekends or something it's a really fun
thing to make so just cut up your
favorite vegetables I went with onions
mushrooms and peppers and then go ahead
and throw them in a frying pan with a
little bit of garlic and start to saute
them up and then as that was cooking I
decided to go ahead and make myself some
hashbrowns because if we're going to
make breakfast we're going to go all
freaking out so I made myself some
hashbrowns which most of the time when
you find frozen hash browns they're
gonna be vegan so just go ahead and cook
up some of those as well and then I'm
just taking some firm tofu that I had
sitting out a little bit so that it
wasn't sitting in the water and then I'm
just gonna crumble that all in as if
it's like scrambled eggs and then you
can add whichever seasoning you please
but I decided to go with salt pepper
paprika and some nutritional yeast to
give it that little bit of like eggy
cheese type flavoring so yeah so that's
all I had to do and then I just sauteed
that up in the frying pan and continue
to mix it in
let sounds Baker's you oh and I wish the
you would stop the creeping down
so then to top off my tofu scramble I
just sprinkled a little bit of spinach
on top after turning off the heat and
then just go ahead and place your tofu
scrambled eggs on a plate your hash
browns or whatever it else are going to
make with it it could be toast or
whatever and some fresh fruit on the
side and that is all there is to making
this like scrambled egg type dish but
vegan so it's really really easy to make
and really really yummy but let's say
you don't want to eat it like this like
with a fork and knife or with hashbrowns
or whichever you could also make it as a
breakfast burrito so all I did was take
some lettuce some salsa and then went
ahead again with the tofu scramble and
sprinkled that all on top and then I put
a little bit of fresh green onion
wrapped it up and eat it like a burrito
this was like this is literally the best
thing ever it's the most delicious vegan
breakfast that you will ever make and if
you really want to spice it up add some
hash browns to it because that's you're
just getting crazy there
are you in the woods and you shot me a
class the way you did before under the
overpass so it was also highly requested
to show you guys pancakes or waffles so
this is my favorite brand of waffles I'm
not gonna make them from scratch because
to be honest I never do that on a
day-to-day basis but this brand of
waffles has so many different flavors
including pumpkin spice which is my
favorite just so you guys know and they
are definitely vegan they have it right
on the box that they're vegan and they
are the most delicious waffles you will
ever find so I'll usually make those
with some fruit or whatever and a little
bit of syrup and that is another go-to
breakfast that I really like that's
super super easy for those of you
especially that are like students or
something it can't be making fresh
pancakes or waffles from scratch and
then last but not least I'm going to
show you this really awesome mug in
muffin in a mug and this is good for
those of you that are in school or ask
for fast breakfast on the go you can
make the dough to this or the whatever
at night time and then in the morning
time all you would have to do is just go
ahead and throw it in a mug and cook it
so I will leave the exact measurements
in all of the ingredients that I use
down below
and the really cool thing about these
mug muffins too is if you make a big
batch of the dough at night you could do
this with blueberries you can do this
with dark chocolate chips or vegan
chocolate chips or whichever really just
whatever your favorite muffin is you can
add those toppings in make the dough at
night and then the next morning all you
have to do is spoonful your dough into a
mug and then throw it in the microwave
for about 5 to 6 minutes and then you
have a cute little mug muffin I think
this is so fun and so easy to do and
really really quick and then you just go
ahead and eat your mug muffin muffin mug
I don't even know what I'm saying
anymore I just keep mixing these out but
yeah so those are the super easy recipes
to make a muffin in a mug so those were
all of the vegan breakfast ideas I had
to show you guys today I hope you guys
enjoyed let me know down below which is
your favorite or if you decide to try
any of these out be sure to send them to
