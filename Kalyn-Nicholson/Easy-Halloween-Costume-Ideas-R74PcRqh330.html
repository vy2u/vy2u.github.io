be sweeter but I prefer you
I prefer better though I before you I
prefer up for you
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's you Tober video we're going
to be doing some really fun and really
cute DIY Halloween costumes whether
you're running late last-minute or just
don't know what the heck to be I'm going
to give you guys four different ideas
that are super easy and also
ridiculously affordable if you guys
aren't following me already I'm going to
leave my Twitter in my Instagram right
here on the screen so you guys can come
follow me and that you guys wanna see
some easy and affordable DIY costumes
for this year then just keep watching so
to achieve this spooky scarecrow look I
just went ahead and put on the lightest
shade of foundation I could find and I
put on one to two coats of this just to
kind of make it more like face paint
than foundation I guess if that helps
so yeah the lightest color that you can
find a foundation just go ahead and put
that on kind of creating that like
burlap sack color and then I'm just
going in with my Kat Von D shade + light
but you can use any sort of bronzer and
I'm starting with a medium toned bronzer
and heavily contouring my face and my
forehead the sockets of my eyes kind of
like a skull as well as underneath my
bottom lip and then I'm going to go back
in with some of the foundation and just
touch up the highlights but yeah you
guys will see what I mean here on the
screen and then I'm going back in again
with the darker Brown from the palette
but again you can just choose a deeper
bronzer we can go to the ocean
and then using the deeper bronzer I'm
going ahead and creating a patch for my
nose that I'm then going to later fill
in with some black face paint as well so
then going in with the black face paint
I just picked this up from Walmart and
I'm using a normal makeup brush I
believe it's just like a pencil or
concealer brush and I'm creating two
black lines that stretch from the sides
of my mouth and then stitches down the
very very middle on my lips as well as
all along the signs of the the black
lines and then I'm just also taking the
face paint and filling in the contour
the nose patch as well as the eye socket
again you guys will totally see what I'm
and then to set the face paint for my
eyes I'm just going in it with a cream
shadow called strat and I'm just putting
this all over my eye kind of creating
the design that I want to do when I go
in with the black face paint this is
just a lot easier to work with and
create kind of like a base and then just
going back in with the black face paint
and filling it in but just be very very
careful to get any in your eyes because
I can tell you first hand that it stings
so then I'm just lining my waterline and
putting on some doubled up lashes and
then that's all there is to this spooky
scarecrow look so to create this
Cheshire Cat look I just went ahead and
did my normal foundation routine and my
normal highlight routine although I did
go a little bit more intense with my
highlight this time because it's
Halloween and we can and I just went
ahead and set it in place with my Kat
Von D shade + light so to begin I'm just
using my Coastal Scents palette in this
like purpley pink color and using a
brush that I spritz some setting spray
on I'm just creating like a purpley pink
nose and then kind of um bringing that
up the bridge of my nose and then I'm
just taking a yellowy cream color
putting that on my lid filling in my
brows and then going back in with a like
lavender and then a hot pink on top and
blending that into place as well as on
my lower lash line and then I'm just
going to create a highlight on the inner
corner and then a very intense liquid
eyeliner cat eye on the inner tear-duct
as well as the outer tear duct after
adding some mascara I'm then just going
to go in with some fake lashes and then
using the face paint I'm going to create
some little whiskers on the side of my
face
taking some white facepaint I'm just
going to create a long extended smile
all the way across my lips and onto my
cheeks now I do recommend maybe doing
this before the whiskers as you can tell
I ended up adding the overlap but then
I'm just taking the black face paint and
outlining the face that we just did and
then adding a curl on the side of the
grin you guys will see what I'm doing
here on screen and then I'm just using
the black face paint again to create
teeth kind of like the big mischievous
smile of the Cheshire Cat like every day
so and then just going back in with that
purpley pink eyeshadow and contouring
lightly my face as well as my forehead
and then I added a purple wig and some
cat ears but you could go ahead and just
use your normal hair and that's all
there is to these Cheshire cat makeup
look mango makeup hey are you down with
I don't like everything is okay so to
start out with the half face skeleton
I'm just going ahead and doing again my
normal foundation routine on the top
half of my face as well as just filling
in my brows and doing like my regular
eye shadow routine if you guys are
wondering what that is I'll leave a link
down below to a makeup tutorial for like
the eye look I'm doing right now but I'm
just going ahead and creating kind of
like a dramatic smoky neutral brown eye
and then adding it some eyeliner and
mascara as well as the fake lashes
before going in and creating the skull
look on the bottom half and everything
is OK
hate me we've been going back and forth
I come with you Francine no you can't
see what you do me you want her you tell
me you love me
you say you want the one for me I leave
you cool so to begin the skull I'm just
taking some white facepaint and putting
this on at the bottom half of my face
and then just creating a kind of like
scoop effect from the bridge of my nose
over to the edge of my cheekbones you
guys can see what I'm doing here on
screen it took me about two to three
layers of the face paint to kind of get
the thickness of the white that I wanted
and then I went in after it dried with
some black face paint it and created a
longer extended mouth as well as two
scoops under my eyes and doing kind of
like the open hole on my nose and then I
just went ahead and created some teeth
you guys can try to watch the process to
which I did this here my only
recommendation would be to not to put
too much black face paint on at once
like if you put it on you're too much on
your brush at once you can completely
destroy your face so just kind of take
it slow and then I just created this
scoop from the top second tooth to my
cheek bone and then back down again with
a straight line from the last tooth
hopefully that makes sense
or you guys can kind of watch what I'm
doing here and then just a very faded
outline for the teeth I don't want you
to leave
so many ups and downs but this was meant
to be day night you on top of me
I love this making no I love when you
kiss me to you I'm waking up light and
last but not least this Halloween
costume is by far the easiest costume
ever and you probably won't have to buy
anything for it so this is super good if
you decide to go at last-minute for
Halloween or if you're looking for
something super easy and affordable to
be so all I did was went ahead and
created like my everyday sort of face
routine except I tried to keep it as
fresh as possible
not using too many dark colors or
creasing my face too heavily so I'm just
using like a light taupe for the crease
in my eye as well as just like a lighter
bronzer for when I was contouring my
face and then popping a lot of highlight
on kind of giving that like morning to
do if that makes any sense and then
after that I just added a robe and a mug
for like kind of drinking out of and
some slippers and then a I mask on my
head and it creates this kind of like
bed head or like lazy sleepy head sort
of impersonation so this is like a super
super easy costume to do and you can go
as all out or as easy with it as you
would want to
much love oot i back in one piece I pay
so that was it for my Halloween costumes

one was your favorite or if you guys
