finally filming another Fitness Friday
which I know a lot of you are going to
be super excited about I haven't done a
fitness video in a pretty long time
other than my how to get fit for the
winter how to stay fit in the winter but
I am going to start bringing Fitness
Fridays back I'm just not going to do
them every single Friday so I'm going to
try and do them like every second or
third Friday but they will be coming
back just not as frequently as every
single week so that is something to look
forward to so thumbs up if you guys want
to see some more fitness Fridays and for
today's video I'm going to be filming
some easy and fun healthy snacks also my
shirt kind of contradicts the whole
Fitness Friday theme considering it says
YouTube in is my cardio laurdiy actually
designed the shirt so I'll leave her
link down below if you guys aren't
looking to buy this same sweater as me
just keep watching to find out some fun
and easy healthy snacks so for this
banana sushi you're going to need some
peanut butter a banana and some cinnamon
or you guys could use other toppings too
if you like I just decided to stick with
cinnamon so what I'm doing is I'm
obviously just peeling back the banana
and I'm just going to cut about two inch
chunks or one of the half-inch I don't
know I'm not that good with measurements
but you can see pretty much how big the
chunks are so I'm just creating chunks
of the banana and then what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to spread the peanut butter
around the outside of the banana to make
it kind of like sushi and then I'm going
to sprinkle some cinnamon on top but you
guys could put some dark chocolate chips
on top you could put some Nutella you
could really go crazy with this one but
to keep it as healthy as possible I
decided to try and stick with peanut
butter and
so this one is really easy but it's
probably one of my favorites in this
video and next I'm going to show you
guys how I make sorbet which is really
really good if you're an ice cream
Craver or you really really like your
ice cream fix then you might like this
one so what I'm going to do is take some
frozen strawberries cut a chunk of lemon
and put the lemon in there as well to
give it a little bit more of like a
strawberry lemonade or pink lemonade
flavor then I'm going to add in one
frozen banana and a couple mint leaves
mysamma ship it's cold
the otic scene
to help it blend them adding a splash of
vanilla almond milk and then I'm going
to go ahead and blend it all together
the thicker the better because it's
going to have more of a sorbet or ice
cream consistency but as long as you
freeze it afterwards you should be fine
so that is obviously my next step is I'm
going to pop it in the freezer for just
a couple of hours and then I ended up
just putting them in little lemon bowls
to make them look prettier but this was
super yummy and it was banana pink
lemonade sorbet
so next I'm going to share with you guys
how I make infused water which is really
good if you're not getting enough water
in your diet but you don't like the
plainness of it this is like a sweeter
way to have some water so what I'm going
to use is frozen strawberries mint and a
lemon and I'm going to start by cutting
up just a couple thin slices of lemon to
put in the water itself and then I'm
going to add a couple mint leaves as
well to let it infuse in the water and
just throw in a couple frozen
strawberries to make it pretty and just
to keep it cold if they are frozen they
kind of act like ice cubes
stitches in your clothes whoa
so clean
last to try
then just go ahead and fill your cup up
with water or if you're making like a
big two-liter jug just fill it all up
with water and then you're going to want
to pop it into the fridge this is best
if you do this overnight to let it
infuse longer and get more of the flavor
but you can also do it for a couple
hours and then add in a couple extra
frozen strawberries for little ice cubes
and you have your infused water which
tastes really really yummy and is way
better than drinking normal water but it
is still getting the same benefits so
next I want to show you guys how I made
these little pita chips with hummus so
what I did is I took a muffin pan and
then just some whole wheat pita and I
microwaved one of the pitas so that it
was easier to rip and tear and so I
brought back my I microwaved it sorry
for like about 20 seconds and then I
just put it into the little muffin
holder cups
I'm then just going to pop it in the
oven at 350 for about 10 15 20 minutes
it all depends on your oven but
basically just until they're kind of
crispy and golden brown and they'll look
like this after you have baked them so
and they'll be a little bit more crunchy
and more like a chip so then what I'm
doing is I'm just taking some hummus and
putting a little dollop in the middle
and then you cannot with other veggies
you want on top but I like to go with
cucumber and tomato
and I find this snack is especially good
if you crave chips or anything crunchy
so for my next snack I'm going to share
with you guys how to make these little
peanut butter apple sandwiches it's
pretty self-explanatory but I start by
taking any Apple you can grab your
favorite kind mine is preferably Granny
Smith and just carve or cut about one
and a half inch slices of Apple and then
you might want to core out the middle
but I just kind of left it and eat
around it and then you can put peanut
butter and you could put some chocolate
chips or you can put a bit of cinnamon
on top or you could really get fancy
with this one but I decided to keep it
with just peanut butter and then
sandwich it together and snack on that
this next snack is a fun spin on your
regular everyday sandwich and they just
make it more fun to eat so what I'm
doing is taking some whole-wheat bread
and it's better to use a baking roller
but I don't have one so I decided to get
crafty and use my cup but I'm just
rolling out the bread so it's nice and
flat and then adding anything that I
would normally eat on a sandwich so some
mustard lettuce tomato pickles onions
you could really get fancy here you
could add meat and cheese if you eat
meat and cheese and just make sure that
you're cutting everything nice and thin
because if it's any if it's thick at all
then it won't roll properly so then all
you have to do is roll it up like
another little sushi roll I know how you
did a lot of like fake sushi in this but
I like sushi so you just kind of roll it
up like a sushi roll and eat it like
it's a little roll and it's just a fun
or way to eat a sandwich and I find it's
less bread and if you're looking for a
fun snack to eat with your sandwich you
could make these carrot french fries
which all you have to do for this is lay
out some carrots on some parchment paper
and anything that seems to be a bit
thicker I would cut it cut it thinner so
that it bakes easier
now you can toss these in olive oil but
I decided to make mine oil free and then
all you have to do is add a little touch
of sea salt and some pepper and pop them
in the oven at 450 for about 10 to 15
minutes
and that is all there is to these baked
carrot french fries so those were all of
my healthy fun and easy snacks for this
spring summer or whenever you're
watching this I hope you guys enjoyed
and I'll see you all in a future video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
