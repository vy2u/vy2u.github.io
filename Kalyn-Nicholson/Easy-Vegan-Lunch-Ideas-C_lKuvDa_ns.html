to be sharing with you guys some vegan
lunches so I did a video a few months
ago that had some really awesome and
like delicious vegan of breakfast
recipes and I said I was going to make
it a series did one for lunch breakfast
dinner desserts treats all of that stuff
and I just never got around to filming
another one so I am still going to make
it a series so this is going to be part
two if you guys haven't seen the first
one I will put something up on the
screen somewhere that you can click on
and go watch it also if you guys aren't
following me already
I will leave my Twitter in my Instagram
right here as well so it back to school
and work and all of that stuff but I
probably would be a perfect time to do
some vegan lunch recipes now you can
make these at home or make these on the
weekend they don't have to be packed
away for school or work or whatever but
you can also pack all the recipes in
this video for lunch so without further
ado let's get hungry
so for the first recipe I'm going to
show you guys that these really yummy
Mexican wraps all I'm doing is just
taking these holy traps that I grabbed
from the grocery store and then I'm
taking some salsa and using this as the
base for the wraps to give it that
Mexican flavor
and then to get a little bit of crunch
I'm going to be chopping up some romaine
lettuce throwing that in there and as
for protein I'm going to throw some
black beans and you can put any beans
inside this you want it doesn't have to
be black beans you could do chickpeas or
anything else and then just chopping up
some avocado throwing that on top and
then finishing it off with some chopped
up red onion after that I'm going to
roll up the little wraps and throw them
into a Tupperware container with some
grapes and there you have some delicious
and easy and Mexican wraps for lunch
you
and also I don't know if you guys know
this but vegan pizza is honestly the
best lunch in the entire world
all you need to do is grab some
whole-wheat pita and then I'm just
taking some tomato sauce you can use
actual pizza sauce but I just prefer to
use marinara I then just picked up this
day a vegan cheese but you can usually
find them like the natural food sections
of grocery stores as well as this Ives
vegan pepperonis and I threw those on
top and then popped it in the oven
Royall for just a few minutes so that I
kept the pita from getting too crispy
and then I just cut it up into fours and
you can also put this into a little
Tupperware or throw it on a plate and
eat it right away but this is honestly
so delicious so good and you don't have
to miss out on pizza we're piggies in a
blanket because I'm also going to show
you how to make those today so what
you're gonna want to do is start by
roasting some carrots with all of your
favorite spices I went with salt pepper
garlic powder and oregano
and another really fun fact is that the
Pillsbury Crescent dough is vegan it
might not be like the healthiest thing
in the world but it is actually
accidentally vegan so I'm just taking
some of those and wrapping up the
roasted carrots and then making all of
these little vegan piggies in a blanket
propping them in the oven just following
the cooking directions off of the back
of the croissants and then there you
have it you have these cute little like
roasted spiced carrots in croissant
dough and then I just made a little side
of mustard to dip it in and that is like
so easy and so good honestly guys these
were delicious they are so good you have
to try them
and then last but not least if you guys
are a big lover of tuna sandwiches this
is a really healthy vegan alternative
all you're gonna need to do is grab some
chickpeas throw them into like a big
bowl and then I grabbed this vegenaise
which again was from like the natural
food section of just like my local
supermarket and then I'm just throwing
some garlic powder salt and pepper and
then mashing it up with a potato masher
taking a whole-wheat bun toasting it in
the oven and then popping this like
puree on top it literally is so freakin
good I just chopped up some lettuce
threw that on top with some tomato and
onion put the top on cut it open and
honestly this is even better than tuna
sandwiches I'm not kidding you guys I
used to love tuna sandwiches before I
was ever vegan and now these are like my
favorite thing in the world so those
were all of the little recipes that I
had to show you guys for some vegan
lunch ideas and yeah
so that was it for my vegan lunches let
me know down below which one was your
favorite or if you decide to cook any of
them tell me aside from that I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will see
you guys all in my next one bye guys
