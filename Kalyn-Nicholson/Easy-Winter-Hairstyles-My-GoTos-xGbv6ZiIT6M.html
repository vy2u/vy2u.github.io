to be showing you some easy winter
hairstyles that I have been loving
lately and I'm going to start out with
this curled one I'm going to be leaving
my hair natural length and I'm just
taking it and putting it into a middle
part brushing it out and adding some
heat protectant
again
then using my one-inch curling iron that
I took the clamp off of I'm just going
to use it as a wand and take random
chunks from my hair and start weaving it
or mean wrapping it backwards on the
curling wand and doing this all over my
head I find if you do this in random
sections it looks a little bit more
natural and it doesn't take a lot of the
length off of your hair especially if
you have shorter hair so I'm just doing
this in a natural kind of bedhead messy
wave type of look where's the you would
stop the creep in down
once the curls are down and then taking
sections on each side leaving pieces out
to frame my face and twisting them
towards the back of my head and then
pinning them in place with some bobby
pins and again I'm doing this on both
sides
and then going to just touch up the
curls of the pieces that are framing my
face and that is all there is to this
hairstyle I think it's really really
cute for the wintertime and I've been
wearing it a lot and I find it
especially looks good with my natural
length of hair
so for this next hairstyle I've been
seeing this one everywhere recently so
I'm clipping in my belly me hair
extensions to get the length that I need
for the hairstyle and then I'm just
creating a side part and taking a
straightener to the top of my head to
make it so that it is more flat and
flatter against my head I'm then taking
some hairspray and just sprang this into
my hair and then brushing it tight
against my head and securing it into a
ponytail in the back then just continue
to hairspray and brush it back until it
says neatly pulled back as possible
after securing it into place I'm just
going to wrap a piece of blonde hair
around the elastic so you can't see it
anymore and that is all there is to this
hairstyle you could do this with
straight hair or you could do it with
curly hair and it looks really cute
so for this next hairstyle I'm creating
a very deep side part my hair then
grabbing three trunks and starting to do
a French Dutch braid so basically for a
Dutch braid you're going to do it just
like you would a French braid but weave
at the opposite way so I'm weaving under
instead of going over which is going to
make the braid stand out more on top of
my head and I'm just continue to doing
this towards the back of my head and
then I'm going to pull up the rest of my
hair and secure it into place with a
messy bun
so after securing it you can play around
with it till it's at its perfect
messiness and this hairstyle is really
adorable if you're just kind of being
lazy around your house or if you wanted
to wear one of those headbands that keep
your ears warm this is the perfect
hairstyle for that so for this next
hairstyle again this is a hairstyle that
has been very very popular and trending
everywhere lately and for this one I'm
going to be clipping in my hair
extensions again because I just find
that this hairstyle looks best if you
have long and thicker hair so I'm just
going to be grabbing all of the hair on
top of my head and pulling it back into
a half of ponytail just like the ariana
grande hairstyle that has been trending
everywhere lately this one is one of the
easiest ones to do but it's definitely a
big big trend right now and it looks
really really cute and adorable for the
winter time
so those were my four simple and easy
winter hairstyles I hope you guys
enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
