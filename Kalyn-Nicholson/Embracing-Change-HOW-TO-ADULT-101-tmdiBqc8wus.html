don't actually have a coffee with me
right now because one I've already had
two today and I'm trying to cut back and
two is still a lot you're making me
really want to go make a decaf right now
I might just have to do that the whole
tight right there let's do this okay so
the topic of today's video is change
erna quote once said the only thing that
is constant in life is change and I feel
like that's probably one of the truth I
feel like that's probably one of the
truth quotes that I've ever read the
only thing that you can be sure of in
this life is that everything changes it
can be a good thing in the sense that if
you feel that you don't like the way
your life is right now or you don't like
the way you feel right now things are
always changing and there will be a time
that you'll feel different and no your
life could look different and the nice
thing about that too is is you can push
that you can push that happen you can
embrace change you can you can actually
create change or it can be kind of a
not-so-good thing in the sense of if you
love the way your life looks right now
if you love where you're at right now
the thought of things changing can be
terrifying I've been in the position
where I love the way my life was so much
that the thought of anything ever
changing scared the crap out of me and
I've been in a position where everything
felt so dull or so stale or I wasn't in
a good place and change is the thing
that kind of pushed me out of it and I
think it all boils down to your
perspective on change the way we look at
it I think the harder we try and hold on
to things the more difficult changes for
us and so regardless of whether you love
the way your life is right now or you
don't I think no matter what we should
always try to embrace any well that's no
mean for a long time a little that this
is so true when I changed my apartment I
change the way my furniture set up I'll
change the decor and I've been doing
this since I was like as long as I can
remember I was always changing around my
room and it's just with a breath of
fresh air
to change things and to embrace your own
change in to force your own change when
you need things to feel different when
you need a new perspective I've also
been in particular
I mean the thought of growing up I was
just recently actually yesterday and I
brought my boyfriend to my hometown and
we were driving around I was getting in
the tour and I was kind of like in this
little place in my head where I was
driving down to certain streets and
remembering driving down the same ones
in high school and feeling so different
and like looks so different and I
remember being so afraid of the change I
was so afraid that everything was
changing oh so afraid that high school
was ending and that my family was
changing and so much was going on I
remember being so afraid and terrified
that and if only I could have looked
forward to five years later going back
there and driving down the same streets
and showing them to him in my own head I
was like wow if only I'd known yeah some
of the change was going to suck but some
of the change was going to be absolutely
out of this world blow your mind amazing
I wouldn't have been so great and - any
one of you guys watching this thinking
to yourself that you're afraid of
everything changing and how everything
is changing is I mean your parents are
growing older you might be moving you
might be seeing new schools you might be
graduating you might just been quite
people on the parsing plant be coming
together but change to be terrifying
keep in mind that if you embrace it and
also if you try and make the best out of
it and see why the change is happening
has changed everything
I believe happens for us whether it's
good or bad it's either to teach you a
lesson or to give you a blessing it's
kind of a hard thing to wrap your head
around but no matter what is going on in
your life right now that you feel like
you're afraid of or intimidated by or
excited for try and see where it could
be taking you because if I had any clue
five years ago that I'd be coming back
and this would be my job and this would
be where I was living with what I'm
doing I honestly would have been so
afraid I think that would have embraced
it more and there's no way for us to
know the changes that are happening
there's no way for us to know how things
are going to look in five years and I
don't know if I would only in the sense
that if someone I don't know let me know
what you guys think down below but if
someone came to you was like I can show
you what your life is going to look like
in five 10 20 years would you do it I
don't know if I would in the sense that
what I don't think and
life is certain I think that again
change can also change I also don't
think I would in a sense that I I
wouldn't want to see something I didn't
like and just believe that that was what
I was doing for like the thought of
having some sense of not control but
input to this change and what I mean by
that is something that I've been trying
to embrace lately and something that I
was struggling with for a little while
is feeling like I had no sense of
control over the things that were
changing like I had no there was nothing
I could do about certain circumstances
in my life and I just had to accept that
that's the way they were and part of
that is true I think there are certain
things in life that we don't have
control over and I think there are
certain things that the only way through
it is to accept it and to not not let it
control us
I think in any given situation the one
thing you do have control over is your
perspective on it and I think if you can
change your perspective on anything than
you can really change the way you
receive things in your life and so even
the things that I didn't like even
things I'm struggling with lately it
took me a while to kind of realize that
you know what instead of looking at this
as something that I can't change or
something that's negative that I don't
like I can look at this as a transition
a lesson on learning and to take the
things that I'm learning from this and
to adapt with them and use them in a
different way than I would and this
wasn't happening to me I was watching
this documentary I'll leave it down
below but one of the things that this
was on a motivational speaker and he
talked about how had a very abusive
mother growing up and she would do some
pretty pretty nasty things to him but
the one thing that he knows that in fact
hasn't happened to me would be was
anyone that goes through anything good
or bad especially the bad though it
takes a while to kind of acceptance but
you wouldn't be who you were without
with us bad you can't just take the good
when it comes to change it goes like the
same way you can't just take the did
change you have to embrace and adapt and
with the bad change because it's making
you into who you are I don't necessarily
think that we have no control over where
our lives are going I don't think that
there's some destination on the map and
you're just walking your way to it I
think that our
and they should constantly change based
on our choices and our perspective and
what we put out to the world and so I
think when it comes to that change if
you go at it with a bad attitude then it
can continuously make a domino effect in
your life where everything else will
start to have a bad taste in your mouth
that was a little kind of happening to
me recently where I just was so negative
about all the things that were going on
instead of looking at it as an
opportunity or starting point I was
looking at it as like what's up what is
going on why then I would just get into
this victim mode where I felt bad for
myself and like I had no sense of
control over what was happening it just
left a bad taste in my nose for
everything else going on in my life and
suddenly I was sitting there looking at
everything going on in front of me going
I it I'm so numb to all of this I don't
even realize how amazing this all is
that is my biggest fear that I would let
those types of things affect the way I
see the world that I was looking at not
just the good but the bad as a stepping
stone in my life I was letting it affect
the way I was seeing everything and
letting it create a domino effect in the
negativity amongst everything else going
on you don't even realize how deep you
are into it so you kind of catch
yourself and you go I don't really like
home being right now and that is like
one of the worst feelings but also one
of the most eye-opening feelings because
when you realize that you don't like who
you've been you can pinpoint back to
where it began and for me it's again
with not liking the things that I had I
felt I had no control over instead of
doing anything about it or embracing it
or seeing where I could work with it sat
on the floor and had a pity party and
just continue on with this link pity
party mentality and it started to ruin
everything for me I decided that I
needed to embrace the change and to show
the universe according uh suss out that
I was ready and willing to look at this
change as an opportunity to move forward
and transform to transition into whoever
the hotline is becoming to look at it
with a better perspective so that no
matter what ends up happening I
understand why it's good for me and why
it needed to happen does that make any
sort of
at all I really hope so the other things
that are also changing along side us
changing our life changing with the
world and the world changes with people
around us change and that can be even
more terrifying we have even less so
feeling of control over those situations
too but no matter what I think when it
comes down to it you have to just focus
on seeing everything in life as the
opportunity to grow or to learn from a
camera died I was on such a good train
sock I guess what I'm trying to get out
here is that change is inevitable and if
you try to avoid change and you try to
push it away it's just going to have its
way with you it's just going to take
over and it'll start to control you
instead of you controlling it I mean I
use control lightly in the sense that I
don't think you should ever obsess over
trying to control the change in your
life because that'll make you only feel
more out of control changing things up
and embracing change for yourself it's
only going to shift your perspective on
change in a way that makes you see it as
a positive and enlightening and a
transformation it rather than something
that is bad or negative or pulling you
away from the things you love no matter
what your core will always be there your
core corridor moral things that are
important to you they're always going to
be there you just might have to see it
in a new perspective for those of you
guys that are going through things that
you don't necessarily like or you're
feeling stale or your mindset back and
even more so I suggest embracing it and
forcing change upon yourself in order to
shift that perspective and get there
sooner and that's kind of where I've
been at and that is why so much is the
changing of my own life those you guys
have all be on snapchat
you guys already know this but I
actually just change you're on my
apartment in the sense that I need is
that fresh perspective and everything is
so easy to look at differently when
everything around you is different
and you can do that with your hair you
can do that with your clothes you can do
that with as simple as changing the
blankets and pillows on your bed or like
those those names that you hang up on
your wall or the background on your
phones help you embrace change and also
show the world that you're ready for it
and you're excited about it
looking at it as an inspirational thing
rather than a terrifying thing and they
know that's not easy to do especially if
you're at a point your life where you
really don't want anything to change
there was probably another point in your
life where you felt that same way
whether you were five whether you were
10 15 however old you where were you
thought this is as good as it's ever
going to get and I don't want it to ever
change and then look at where you're at
now and think oh my god if only I know
that it was only going to get better or
it was only going to get even more
crazier things that I wouldn't even
imagine could have happened happens you
might not even know that the change is
only pushing you into something even
better helping you transform to the life
that you actually are meant to have or
you really want to have but if you spend
too much time holding on to what's in
front of you you aren't going to be able
to get there even if you do get there
you won't even notice that you're there
and you won't like harvest it you won't
take advantage of it you can do be so
focused on holding on to the past
another thought that I really like is if
you are depressed you are living in the
past if you're anxious you're living in
the future and if you're at peace you're
living in the present this is something
I'm really trying to adapt into my life
right now because I've been waving in
and out of tiny little bits of feeling a
little bit low or feeling a little bit
stressed and anxious and I'm trying to
answer myself for the present moment if
I accept that for what it is
I left peace and I feel good and I feel
like anything can happen and I can
change my perspective to see this
present moment as something I was
working winning in for me and past
decisions led me to right here at this
moment and everything changed for this
reason check into what's going on around
you and embrace what's happening in
front of you because then you don't have
to feel depressed about the past then
you'll have to feel anxious about the
future you can just be in tune with
what's going on in front of you and you
can sync yourself to it and you can
embrace it and be inspired by it and get
excited about it because everything is
so unknown and even the things we're
trying to plan for in the future there
are these moments where everything is so
pivotal and it changes and it's
sometimes this is for the best and
sometimes it is but no matter what it's
always working for us and so that is why
change is always such a good thing it's
so good for your soul it's so good for
your perspective and it's so good for
your life and always teaching you
something or bringing
you something and if we can just check
in and get our minds there that we can
see all change as good change or
transitional change or change that is
bettering us even if it isn't that great
in the moment it's going to put us to
somewhere better in the future you just
have to kind of have faith in that and
trust that and I know that that's not an
easy thing to do and that's partly the
reason behind my face tattoo there's
really reasons why I got it but that was
one of them is to have faith that what
is happening is happening for you and
not to you and to have faith in yourself
that no matter what does happen you have
built a strong enough core within even
if at one point in your life you may not
have seen it that way I think if you
have faith in yourself and you'll sink
in your life and your face in what's
happening around you in the universe and
all of that corny ass I know that
it sounds so corny and sometimes when I
say it out loud but truly and honestly
as your faith and the good there's no
way you can fail I really don't think
that you can if you constantly keep that
faith coming back man that deep little
hole we just got we just got real deep
there but cutting back out of that and
tying it all back into what's going on
right now I'm going to be doing some
changes on my channel my website is also
down right now I'll be for maintenance
because I'm changing things up I need to
just shake things up a little bit in my
