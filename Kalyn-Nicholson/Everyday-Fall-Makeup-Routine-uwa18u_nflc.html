to be sharing with you guys my everyday
makeup routine kind of like summer
transitioning into fall the only part
that I didn't add to this makeup
tutorial is if I'm going to be filming
that day or you know if I just feel like
it or I'm going to like dinner or lunch
with a friend or something I will
sometimes add false lashes but other
than that my makeups pretty generally
the same so if you guys want to see my
everyday makeup routine for the fall
then just keep watching so I'm still
using the Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation it's an absolute favorite of
mine and I just use about two pumps of
that and I'm in the color sand and then
using a damp Beauty Blender I just go
ahead and Pat that away on my skin until
I get a bit an even layer across my
whole face she's a good girl and as for
brows I've been using the Tarte
Amazonian clay brow mousse and I am in
the color taupe and just using an angled
brow brush I go ahead and outline my
eyebrows lightly and then fill them in
making sure to comb them out at the ends
that they are blended see there's a free
way to the eye
I shadow my favorite palette recently
has been the Jacqueline Hill favorites
from morphe palette and I've been using
this to either play around with my
makeup but also for my day to day so I
just use the like matte brown color in
my crease and then I go ahead with this
rosy gold all over my lid and then
taking a darker brown matte on a pencil
brush and going ahead and putting this
in my crease and then blending it
upwards and trying to concentrate it
more so on the outer corner of my eye
and then I go in with this darker
shimmery color and then put that on the
outer third of my eye and then I go in
with my Too Faced chocolate bar and I
use the lighter matte color to highlight
underneath my brow bone as well as the
inner tear-duct
and then once my eye shadow is done I go
in with the Too Faced Born This Way umm
concealer and I go ahead and put that
all over underneath my eyes on my chin
on the bridge of my nose and as well as
my forehead and then using a damp Beauty
Blender I go ahead and play
in the shadows and the booth so to set
my concealer I've recently been using
the Kat Von D shade and light palette in
the medium toned highlight color and
just patting that in where I just put
the concealer and then going back in to
the darker matte Brown shadow I'm just
lining my lower lash line with this with
the same pencil brush as before
so after crowing my lashes I then go in
with the Too Faced better than sex
mascara this is still a favorite of mine
I haven't been able to find a
cruelty-free dupe that tends to do
better with my lashes than this one I
like find that it gives lots of volume
so I add as many coats of this as
possible unless I'm adding false lashes
which then I'll only usually add about
one to two coats of mascara and then to
set my whole face in place I'm just
using the Too Faced primed and poreless
and no this is not being sponsored by
Too Faced they're just my favorite
cruelty-free brand and then a contour
I'm going in with the Too Faced dark
chocolate Soleil which also smells like
hot chocolate so it's a double whammy
wanna ride her name her name in the sky
and then I'm just finishing up by
touching up my t-zone with the lighter
matte colors from the shade and light
palette as for lipstick my current
favorite is this bite lipstick in the
color cashew it's actually a multi stick
that you can use all over your face but
I've just been using it for lips and the
odd time blush and then touching up one
last coat of mascara before being
finished so that was it for my everyday
makeup I hope you guys enjoyed if you
guys aren't following me already I'm
going to leave my Twitter in my
Instagram right here on the screen if
you guys want to see more makeup
tutorials just thumbs up this video and
other than that I will see you guys all
