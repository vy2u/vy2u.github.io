get burned through darkness uh no
don't get up like that it is in the
background kick it down the front with
the lovers I know
I know
hey guys so for today's video I am going
to be doing a casual makeup hair and
three outfit ideas you might notice in
the video that I change up my lipstick
color but basically it's because the
makeup look itself can be worn with
pretty much any single lip color you
want so I showed two different lip
colors and three different outfits so
yeah if you guys want to see more videos
like this where I kind of do like a hair
and makeup look for something specific
and then a couple outfit ideas just go
ahead and thumbs this up and I'll not
just keep watching to see some casual
hair makeup and outfits
these wild eyes
so starting out with my covergirl
trublend foundation in the shade m5 and
this has been my newest most favorite
foundation for the spring because it
goes on nice and light and it adds a lot
of color and complexion and then I'm
just going in with my covergirl eye
rehab concealer and just blending this
in with a small stippling brush to set
everything in place I'm going in with my
Too Faced primed and poreless which is
my new favorite pressed powder and as
for my brows I'm going in with my makeup
Forever aqua brow which again you guys
know is my newest favorite brow product
for eyeshadow I'm going in with a very
very rich gold color and I'm just using
a damp makeup brush to set this onto my
eyelids to make the vibrancy of the
metallic really bright and then I'm
going in with my NYX love in Paris and
I'm just taking the matte Brown or taupe
color and just blending this into my
crease
and then I'm just taking the matte
chocolate brown color and just blending
this more so out into my outer-v
and then taking these champagne color
and popping it into my inner tear-duct
as well as underneath from my brows and
then I'm just going in with a couple
coats of my falsies mascara and I ended
up leaving the full process of me
putting on the mascara and just sped it
up for you guys so that I didn't have to
cut anything out so you guys can see how
much work actually goes into how many
coats I do and then I'm just contouring
my face with another favorite which is
my NYX matte bronzer which again you
guys already know
just say hello
and as for blush I'm going in with
Annabelle's sorbet just because it's a
nice bright color for the spring as for
lipstick colors I went with two
different colors based on the outfit one
of them was garnet flame by covergirl
and the other one was fused to flash by
Maybelline so I will let you guys know
which was which in the outfits and then
I'm just putting on my Pantene tried to
fight into my hair and this is something
that you can actually smooth throughout
your whole head and it's just going to
make your hair feel a lot more
moisturized and very easy to deal with
and then I'm using my Pantene full neck
spray and this just adds a lot of extra
volume into your roots so all you have
to do is spray and then just kind of
shake your hair out and then I just went
about blow-drying my hair and then after
a fully fully blow drying it after I had
sprayed the root spray and I am just
going to cook in my extensions
so look I've been really loving for the
spring is the half-up hairstyle so I'm
just scooping up half of my hair and
then just securing it with an elastic
and being sure to smooth it all out and
then what I'm going to do is take a
curling iron that I remove the clamp off
of to make it a curling one it's about a
one-inch or one and a half inch and I'm
just wrapping all of the curls away from
my face
so this is a really easy hairstyle to do
whether you have long hair or short hair
and I just love the look of this because
I find it very pretty and girly and
especially for the spring
and as for outfits this first outfit is
inspired by Lulu's so I will leave all
of the links to the pieces that I can
find down below and I just ended up
pairing it with some hot fuchsia flats
and keeping the rest of it very neutral
and the flat actually matched my lips so
for this second outfit I decided to pair
a pair of boyfriend jeans with some
little booties and a crop top and then
just tie a little plaid shirt around my
waist again I'll leave links to
everything I can find down below
and since it was requested that I put
together an outfit using you leather
vest that I got from Charlotte Russe
this is the outfit I pieced together and
again I'll leave links to it down below
so I hope you guys enjoyed this casual
moreso everyday hair makeup look and
outfits for the spring I'll see you guys
on the future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
