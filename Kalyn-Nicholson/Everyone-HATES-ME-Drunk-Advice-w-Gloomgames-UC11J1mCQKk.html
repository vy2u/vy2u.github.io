that here usually on shoes we've grabbed
lots of joy hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm doing a collab with griddles
Cassie here okay normally that was
cloudy apples now known as moving hello
I'm glad to be here and I'm excited to
give you guys some advice yes Taylor
alert we're drunk I don't do that
already I want to pop the video
somewhere up on here or link it down
below so check out how we got hammered
we were playing a wonderful game
color-block Turner and neither much a
drinker so this is a curvier girl yeah
the guys will be honest but we can't say
it'll be a quality all right well I
tweeted back yeah that we were going to
be doing a Q&amp;amp;A and we got quite a few
responses get in there let's see what
we've got
shall we all right we've got rose wanna
know what song is on repeat for you now
last time instrumental by monogram well
wonders team it will be fun code up to
us very happy fairies cover mother a so
Mike is not happy into this child
challenge a little person asylum poem
she keeps other I know so he really
wants now how do I deal with feelings
like everybody hates me
that's a tough one try my best not to be
brutally honest right now because I feel
that feeling pink it appears but the
problem is that you have anxiety and the
problem with anxiety is that it's very
self-absorbed
it's very self-absorbed to walk into a
room if you like everybody thinking
about me right now everybody is giving
me spot right now fact is people don't
really care but I always I always think
that everybody in a room doesn't like me
what iíd goes to it helps to realize
that it's a very self-centered thought
most people don't care most people you
know like what am I getting for dinner
or and like people probably don't hate
you at all I just wish we could all get
along like we used to in middle schools
and rezoning
happy everybody's Ameer do you feel like
everybody hates you you gotta ask
yourself like how do you feel about
yourself pretty deep it is pretty me
that I do all hate you then doing your
thing
yeah keep living your life because
you're above all the haters do guys
Kayla wants to know I have two questions
first one do you guys love me sorry
also if you could meet anyone in the
world who would be you so that we could
find out yeah so I think I want to be
along less why do you bring me the guy
who made Tecla hey anyone do they catch
me alive a little beaver just because I
feel like he's so misunderstood and not
only does it like there's a chance we
could make it I wouldn't agreed what he
had like the lone one you like that well
I thought he was trying to like steal
some fever and you AMA could be good
that would be a good ruin any well we're
preparing for that now score from the
grooves gone away Julian who wants to
know red wine or white wine
when I first met Caitlyn I was like red
or white she was a gret like all right
we're going friend Irana source red I
like your name pending it's a bad first
impression it's hard to say because what
if somebody makes a bad first impression
it would take a decent chunk of like
hanging out with them on good terms for
me to change my first impression my
boyfriend made a terrible person
really I thought he was a copy stock low
key like that then I did not like my
girls like apples no girls like guys
that are sure of himself we like
everybody like pompous guys like
confidence and girls at home like yeah
he had a lot of spirits and things to
say and I was like as if you're coming
at but you know what you might be right
for me I try not to make it over until
like the best way to get to know
somebody is to have them talk about
themselves
ask questions let them talk and listen
attentively
I'm like more jumping I feel good pretty
good round oh yeah yeah leave a comment
down below you get that you're like tall
or short okay I feel like 510 and I'm
like sorry uncle in in your favor right
you get some get some photos going low
right wall boyfriend low photo all right
oh my god or baby we're talking about
you look so soft great
Jessica would like to know what do you
think about teenage girls these days
they have names toriel they have a
crispy fake vodka double Chevron and I
was bullied for being flat I was bullied
for not being able to and make up I was
bullied for how I dressed and I wanted
all these big sisters on YouTube right
they weren't there yet i if I could find
a photo of me when I was a teenager this
ruggle was so real now you see teenage
girls you're like he's killing it harder
than I anything they skip the offer
saying straight to pretty I would hate
to also grow up in this day and age
because while people have a lot of
youtuber and like bigger sisters on the
internet it's also a lot more pressure
than we dealt with when we were there if
we can't even imagine going through the
awkward phase at this time in the
university to look perfect have a killer
body go on insane vacations and like
you're 16 like I struggle with it at 23
I feel the guys don't really have to go
through hey what am I think of you
teenage girls I love you I hope that all
the YouTube tutorials and everything
that's out there I hope it makes you
happier yes if it doesn't then don't be
too hard on yourself everybody out there
is lost we're all depressed we're all
lonely we all feel weird we're all
sharing a common experience Oh fun fun
baby buddy fun go out there yeah there
is too much that she ate really well
right should we and Ellen last question
Bobby you feel about rejection and any
rejection stories - I hate rejection
it's like illness is probably still one
of the biggest fears as much as I like
to try and cope that we're all trying to
be so accepted by one another that I can
see
you can see what they're doing and it
hurts and if you put too much value into
what other people think of you you
reject it it literally destroyed you in
terms of stories oh he Wilford looks too
drunk for this was date I'm going to be
so ugly I'm going to be like high
frequency like good energy and it's just
magical and he was like very like my
language was telling me a little
different but I just like ignored it
along I just never heard from him and it
like devastated me sucks when you get
rejected depends did it hurt yourself to
be a it did it's it it hurts your public
scene because you're like what was it
about me that made this person go away
there's nothing wrong with me or is it
maybe just that I'm not their cup of tea
my rejection story was in fifth grade
guys like me I didn't even know who he
was but he was like I don't know he
likes me take me to a movie he did and
then one day he decided he didn't like
me and I got liked it I was like what
and like there's their humility to that
there's a bit of humility to that
there's a bit of like maybe I'm too
stuck-up
maybe I'm two coffees maybe my parents
raised me a certain way that's not right
hard to draw that line between I don't
ever need to change ever then maybe
there might be something that can use
some work
what is the person who's rejecting you
is a very good person I think if you're
getting rejected by like a really really
good person that's a good example - or a
good chance to kind of reflect did you
do everything with love today with
anything always I hold was anything
negative I have used a lot of my
rejections to better myself as a person
it worked it gives you a chance to like
look at yourself from someone else's
perspective even if they're not going to
tell you why they're rejecting you you
can still kind of put yourself in their
shoes and be like what was it that made
them not feel right about me and it's
not something that I should be taking
personally or something that I should
just let go yeah I want to know how I
attacked other people or how you're
perceived by other people yeah because
we are so in our own heads we think we
have this perception of ourselves but
it's so different to see yourself to be
somebody else
well that went very well so that was
