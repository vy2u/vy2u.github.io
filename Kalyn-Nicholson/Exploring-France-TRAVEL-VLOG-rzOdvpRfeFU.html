my channel for today's video I am doing
another vlogs with you guys I'm actually
about to head to France my car is should
be here pretty soon to come pick me up
not really wearing much makeup to this
light because the next like it's like a
14 hours I think it's just straight
traveling like between planes and car
eyes and other planes and other car
rides I'm just pretty comfortable I'll
be guys a little outfit of the day or
for like traveling or whatever wearing
is this jacket from Frankie no it's like
a dusty rose underneath somewhere just a
plain black t-shirt from brandy melville
some little lemon leggings just because
I wanted to be super comfortable and
then I might see I'm wearing these like
vans and they're in like a baby pink in
like a taupe color that matches the
jacket that I'm wearing and then my
backpack flash carry-on is also baby
pink so I'm like super deco and like
this dusty pink color today currently
watching Nashville I just downloaded a
bunch of movies for the flight since the
flight is so long I downloaded Nashville
in the originals so I think I'm going to
watch them it out and get some dream
catcher work done while I'm on the plane
I'm going to run up through the grab
some rice bowl because I'm or you
feeling tired and the child haven't even
begun and then pack up my bags and start
this long long travel
we call that all try
I know officially made it to France and
made it to my hotel excuse my voice I
haven't slept in over like 28 hours now
I've been like dozing in and off having
like little naps at the airport and
little naps on the plane but like not an
actual legitimate sleep so my sickness
is just like amplified so much visually
here this hotel room is insanely
beautiful and I even have this like
little patio that's like so cute like
look at that oh I try and find a way
that I can get a coffee up here and go
sit out there in the morning because
that would just be insanely epic and a
little bit of time before we meet for
dinner everybody's super tired from
traveling so wash my face and then try
and maybe feel a little catnap as I can
and then meet everybody downstairs for
dinner tomorrow is going to be a pretty
crazy day like we're going to a cave
we're going to want a helicopter ride
we're doing like the craziest the
craziest of crazy and like look at this
like look at all the stuff they've left
because how cool is all of this so we're
at the Reebok hotel in oh my gosh I
cannot fir never say the city right that
we're in in France is her pain yeah I'm
probably not even making any sense right
now
Oh
in the
yes
good morning guys it is now getting
really close actually to 11 a.m. I have
to head downstairs and meet everybody
because we are heading up to the caves I
woke up this morning and went downstairs
and had some breakfast with Tanja she is
like our coordinator for biotherm here
and she's super super sweet we were
talking about her dogs all morning and
it just like any time anyone wants to
talk about jobs I'm like thank you so I
had like two coffees some fruit and a
piece of toast and now I'm going to have
to run downstairs because we're heading
out but also as we were like eating
breakfast I also came so I don't even
know if I told you guys that the else I
like the Victoria's Secret Angel she's
here for this too and as we're eating
breakfast and as we're talking about
this she like walked in and I was like
I'm going to grab the phone charger they
gave us because my phone is getting
pretty close to dead which is not good
because I want to try and snapchat as
much of this today as I can with you
guys and also we're taking a helicopter
ride today which is insane I've never
been on a helicopter always wanted to so
this is going to be so cool like always
I'm just open for the adventure and
that's always like the best way to go
into it because you know your
expectations always get like mass exceed
a like I hope I can get good enough
footage to do this place justice because
France is freaking beautiful already and
I already feel like my Clips didn't do
it justice and I wanted to bring my DSLR
camera but we can't pack like big things
for the helicopter so praying the God
that this little Sony is going to pull
through and show you guys exactly what
I'm seeing because it's so beautiful
here and I just want to try and capture
as much of it and make it as
aesthetically pleasing for you guys to
watch as possible let's go on this
adventure shall we
you're the coolest thing that you've
ever seen
sorry 100,000 users and they found it
but probably even older the
and introduce everybody valuate this is
tan yet isn't it a good way if you want
to introduce Abellio imagine I like
oh I see so we're now heading to the
helicopter which is super exciting and
then we're taking the helicopter to
lunch so prepare for another nice little
beat drop and some really cool b-roll
because I mean I love copter right
Oh golly
Oh
Oh
you're scared because somebody can
chance to see the only thing you can see
my Hara totally died was getting that
fascia image the actual life plankton
facial and it was amazing like the girl
was like massaging my hand and like took
off all my makeup and like massage it
into my you like face and my temples and
I honestly was falling asleep it was so
amazing
apparently it really even helped like
heal acne scar and color spots and such
on your face which I actually have a lot
of that so I'm actually going to do it
for the eight days and see what happens
if you guys want me to update you guys
let me know I can update you via love or
just like on Twitter or something but
let me know if you guys want to see that
because it's actually been kind of
something that's been bothering me
lately is I'm normally okay without
wearing foundation I normally just throw
on mascara most days when I don't really
feel like doing my makeup but lately
I've been feeling and overwhelming like
necessity to wear foundation just be
comfortable in your own skin but I'm
noticing a lot of scarring and like
sunspots and stuff on my skin lately I
have I get really bad like redness and
stuff on the bottom of my cheeks you
can't tolerate now I'm wearing a lot of
makeup but anyway I'm going to give it a
go and try for the eight days and see
what happens I'm now back at my hotel
I just got ready because we're about to
go meet for dinner led to the quick
shower oh my gosh she didn't see me
vlogging in the day I'm just wearing
black pants and this black bodysuit from
Arista that I've told you guys about
it's like that body through that I buy
in every single color because it's
amazing and then I have the choker that
I actually made when I was at Coachella
because the soul is literally beautiful
this is actually where we're all meeting
for dinner so luckily for
we don't really have to leave our rooms
with that said I'm going to throw on my
jacket and then head downstairs to
dinner honestly I love it here it's so
beautiful the hotel's beautiful
everything we're seeing is beautiful and
it's just like it blows my mind the
caves are beautiful
oh I just love everything we've seen so
far and it's making me so antsy to
travel and I'm just like I'm feeling
very humbled and very grateful to be
here and just like a huge thanks to
Biotherm for bringing me honestly I
learned so much today even just about
the brand itself like how eco-friendly
they are and they are cruelty free the
links down below that explains
everything to use the science to create
the bacteria that's needed for the
products that they're using so they're
very eco friendly I don't know I'm just
loving this trip it's been so grated
anyway I'm going to run downstairs now
and grab dinner and you guys are going
to see because I'm a blog camera with me
come and head back home tomorrow is a
short trip but it was a good one it was
a sweet one and honestly I need to come
back to France so many of you got in the
comments and being like please come
visit me and if I had more time I
honestly would but France is I'm going
to be back here you this you have my
word
this is me promising my future self that
I will go back to France it's going to
happen this is Lee huh and real quick
how could I forget we also go to me Elsa
the Victoria's Secret Angel and she was
honestly like a beaming ray of sunshine
she was so nice she was so sweet and
just like the prettiest human being I've
ever witnessed in my life because
there's nothing better than finding out
that someone you think is really cool is
really cool and person to like really
nice and their personality like matches
their coolness
yeah
Oh
oh boy so it's getting pretty close till
11 p.m. I'm about to pack up my suitcase
and hit the hay because we've got to
meet downstairs at 5 a.m. tomorrow gonna
be the longest day ever this is such an
awesome trip I met some awesome awesome
people like I really need Katherine but
she's so sweet and Alex her fiance Dan
and Tania like everybody was just so so
nice and it was just such a good trip
excited to go home and then I have
another adventure next week there's a
lot of traveling going on in the next
little bit but I miss Bentley and I miss
my dad drawing on some Nashville I'm
packing up my suitcase
taking off my face and tucking myself
into bed probably not making much sense
right now because I'm so tired but I
