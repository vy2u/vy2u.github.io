telephone hey guys what's up and welcome
back to my channel you might be
wondering where exactly am i right now
today's video is going to be a little
mini Toronto staycation and there's a
whole reason behind why I'm doing it
which we will get to but as for where I
am I'm actually currently in an Airbnb
in Yorkville Toronto so there's a couple
factors that kind of played into why I'm
here right now the first one is that in
my actual apartment building which
obviously is in Toronto it's currently
getting some construction done inside
its due to the piping and the plumbing
inside of our building and for that
reason they need access to our condos
during the day which is normal for
people that go to work and will be out
of their hair but because I work at home
and because Bentley we would have
literally been just sitting in my
apartment with a bunch of strangers
cutting up walls and replacing pipes and
I just that just sounded like a headache
I really didn't want and the second
factor is I talked about this in my
spring cleaning video part 1 I've been
like itching to kind of move and I don't
know if I want to stay in the area that
I'm in in Toronto or try out somewhere
news for today's video I'm trying to
different areas of Toronto to different
Airbnb to different apartment Styles
basically to complete opposites of
Toronto and seeing if either of those
kind of speak to my soul more so welcome
to day 1 I just got to this Airbnb I'm
staying in New York felt as I mentioned
Yorkville is kind of like I want to say
a little bougie a little bougie area of
Toronto there's really nice high-end
shops it's more up-to-date because I
don't think it's as old as other areas
of Toronto really nice restaurants
really nice stores and obviously really
nice condos because this place is
beautiful
first let me give you guys a little bit
of a breakdown of how I'm gonna review
each place of Toronto I'm gonna try a
cafe I want to find a cute like nice
area to walk Bentley you because
that's gonna be important to wherever I
move and I'm gonna try obviously you
know the vegan food because girl's gotta
eat it's curling for 28 in the afternoon
it's also snowing out I'll give you guys
a little look at what I'm seeing right
now this is not spring weather I'm very
upset
about cold though don't let it fool you
I'm not gonna let this get me down
because I can tell Springs coming it's
gonna unpack a few of the things that I
brought kind of settle into the Airbnb
and then I think I want to go shopping
if I can find a cute cafe while I'm
shopping too we'll just knock that one
off the list before we jump into the
b-roll and the fun music I'm gonna give
you guys a really fast
Airbnb tour because the other thing that
I'm doing in this vlog is both Airbnb s
are completely different styles of
condos so when it comes to moving I have
kind of two options in mind which I will
digress into later on this style is more
its first of all it's smaller this isn't
even a one full bedroom this is like
kind of bachelor style where the bedroom
is just separated by a glass wall I'm
basically gonna see if downsizing to
this size is realistic for me let me
give you guys a tour of the york bill
spot okay so when you first walk in this
is what you kind of see first off
there's just a little mini closet here
quite small that could be a struggle
like a really nice bathroom pretty
standard I do have to say this is a nice
touch for an Airbnb like a fresh
toothpaste and toothbrush killing it
I'll leave the link to this Airbnb down
below they've got flowers lots of plants
I'm liking that I could get I could I
could do with this spam this is a good
size bathroom as for the main area you
come out and then the first thing is
kind of like the bedroom area so this is
what you would have although this is a
really oh my god no no no no I would
definitely need a lot more closet space
because I'm heading to Kingston after
this I'm gonna be gone for four days so
that's all just kind of the stuff that I
had to pack but in terms of living this
this would be definitely a struggle to
downsize to this kind of bedroom but I'm
not against it and then as you kind of
walk through there's these glass doors
that I think you can like close if you
want to separate things I mean you don't
really have privacy for doing that
because you can still
through but I think it's just like maybe
if someone's sleeping and I don't know
who knows what that's all about
but then after you move the glass
dividers there's basically a little mini
living room slash kitchen area so it's
just like a mini kitchen I don't even
think that there's a full stove but I do
have to say I need to know where where
she got this kettle I've popped a few of
my things here I'm gonna make some
French press coffee in the morning and
then when you turn around it's just kind
of like the TV livingroom area this
would be a huge huge downsize for me but
I really like the vibe in here the only
thing that I wouldn't be able to do with
this condo is there's no balcony and I
would definitely need about it
well just
you forget
tonight
we sneak out in
Oh
you know
wait come back
backstreet fear
- this army
okay but really quick I wanted to kind
of update you guys
I won't ramble your guys's ear off but I
will show you really quickly first thing
I didn't pick these up right on this
shopping trip but I did pick these up
this morning I met my friend Megan we
went to bloom wares for some like vegan
bagels and vegan doughnuts and then we
hit up with this crystal shop that she
really likes going to called happy soul
and I picked up two new books from there
the first one is numerology by Anne
Christie kind of interested in
numerology ever since I started reading
Eat Pray Love and she kind of talked
about it in the beginning I just thought
it'd be like a cool Avenue to learn a
little bit more about and then the other
one that I picked up is moon ology and
we were really interested in the ologies
this is working with the magic of the
lunar cycles and I think I talked to you
guys about the book called witch that I
read earlier this year and it made me
really want to learn more about the
phases of the Moon so when I saw these
books I figured they were good
nonfiction to add to my list as for the
shopping that I did today first like I
said 24 is gonna be the year of the
green thumb for me and with planting and
wanting to get new plants plant new
flowers all of that fun stuff on my
patio inside my Zen / office space I
knew I needed to pick up a book on
gardening it's not even just about
gardening but it's all about how
gardening is actually really good for
like your mental health and wellness and
how to kind of tie it into living a
happier life and then I saw this one at
the checkout and I grabbed it for a
fiction book it's called the measure of
my powers and buy more of food misery
and Paris the other things I picked up
where this candle which I'm about to
burn I'm gonna go take a bubble bath
while I'm here before heading to bed
they have like purple amethyst they had
pink quartz as you burn it crystals
become available to you and this one
smells so good
the other thing I picked up which again
I keep on referencing of my spring
cleaning blog but it's because we
decided a lot of life things and that
was I really want to start gardening and
planting things especially on my patio
and in at my office space so I picked up
a little cilantro herb kit so I could
start my herb garden I picked up one
more thing this is gonna be for the part
two in the spring cleaning series of
redecorating but I picked it up today so
I'll show it to you guys this little
cactus cause no it
I'm gonna put them the other things I
got were just from Free People I picked
up just two quick little things from
here I'm heading to California in a few
weeks so I picked up a new pair of jean
shorts for this spring and summer I'm
venturing out of my comfort zone I
picked up not only are they capris but
they're like khaki capris and this is so
not something I would have worn last
year but it's something I'm gonna try
and wear this year so that's my update
so far I'm gonna pack this stuff back up
so it's ready to go in the morning
brew myself a nice little bubble bath
maybe read a chapter of my book and then
hit the hay because I have a 6:30 a.m.
at yoga class tomorrow and a dog that's
waiting to be cuddled so let's get the
bath bomb fizzing and get to bed
anywhere only your name
well we literally have five minutes
before we need to check out isn't that
right mr. Bentley grab the Jeep
basically head to the second Airbnb
which is in the Distillery District so
that is where we're heading to next my
overall consensus on this spot and this
location
no one ever ate everything on a 10 star
scale so yesterday I tried at this cafe
called the sari cafe and it's hilarious
because I've actually seen it before on
that like instagrams I accidentally
stumbled upon it when I was trying to
find a cafe it was pretty cute it was
very quaint but very small I think I
liked the cafe that I went to this
morning better all vegan nut free
preservative free soy free gluten free
and gold utensils and it was just so
cute so putting those two cafes together
I'm gonna give it a full 10 stars if it
would have just been in the sari cafe I
think it would have rated about a 7 but
the Sorrell cafe brought it right over
the top in terms of food the food that I
got was just takeout sushi because I
feel like I'm knowing a good sushi place
around your area sushi is one of my
favorite foods so I mean it was very
subpar sushi so maybe six stars analyst
opinion although there are way better
restaurants around here there's planta
which is a really really nice vegan
restaurant I've been to it multiple
times it's also Cibo rate at the bottom
of this building too which I love as
well the mushroom appetizer oh my god
don't get me started so if we're gonna
put those in there considering the only
thing I tried was the sushi and I put
Yorkville up at about an 8 or 9 out of
10 stars I love a good busy city don't
get me wrong but I also like the nature
and the prettiness of you know by the
water or whatever so the only thing we
could really find around here when we
were walking or these cute little houses
and like a couple cool little things but
in terms of finding places to walk or
take Bentley I'm gonna rate your trail
of at a four-star overall in terms of
the actual apartment if I would be able
to downsize to this I love The Bachelor
because it's so small but I think it's
almost too small for the amount of work
and stuff that I do from home I'm gonna
say it's about a six star an overall
location I love Yorkville I love the
shopping but I don't think it's
somewhere that I want to live full term
so I'll probably keep coming to
Yorkville but in terms of living in
Yorkville I don't I don't think it's for
me so with that let's move on to Phase
two
of this vlog and we're going to the
dispute
this place probably more what I'm gonna
go for her Greg is also gonna meet me
out for dinner later tonight I think
we're gonna go to this place I asked the
guy that opens this Airbnb and he said
there was a really really good Mexican
place down the street made out of this
like really old house so I thought it
would be really cool the area itself
that this building is it's a little bit
more rundown so we'll see about the
whole walking Bethany situation but as
for the style of apartment slash condo I
mean let me just give you guys the tour
because wait TC so you walk in first of
all there's these really cool like old
lockers let me just give you guys an
overview this place is amazing it's
really cool old exit sign someone
walking around upstairs so many plants
in here I'm like I'm living right now
and then over on this side there's just
like this old I dropped all my stuff
right there but just this like desk more
plants just so many plans not only is
there like this really cool old ladder
there's also a swing this is not just
for aesthetic
I officially want the swing in my
apartment a little chair I threw my
cardigan there outside isn't like the
most insane view loft style windows with
like brick this place just has so much
character I can't get over a kitchen
area there's these three stools and a
table over here is like the living room
area which is also super cool look at
this light chandelier thing they have
they also have a doughnut pillow and
then there's this little area here this
is so cool this cooks up to the TV they
have like an a infuser
and then this like light thing like guys
that would be such an easy DIY to do and
then more plants this is making me so
excited to start getting really into
plants and then flipping back around
there's just like this big chair there's
the TV and they put this like really
cool old vintage frame over it so many
plants and then this is the bedroom area
I'll give you guys a little look at it
it's just pretty standard the blinds are
shut right now so it's a little dark in
here it's give it a go so yeah but this
vibe is so this is what I'm missing in
my life I have a few hours to kill
obviously before I meet Greg for dinner
and I actually have some editing to do I
have some work to do emails to answer
and honestly I couldn't think of a
better place to do it than here so we do
some swinging answer some emails get
some work done that's set for the next
15 minutes I'm going to literally just
exist and probably swing
oops sorry
okay so current update it's actually
going on 8:30 I'm just about to go meet
Greg he's here to pick me up downstairs
we're gonna go walk over to this place
called restaurant called cocina
economica i walked around a little bit
today I checked out that neo Kafe so
cafe checked off the list
I didn't uploaded my video in terms of
this specific location of this Airbnb
there's not a lot around here so that's
kind of factoring into how I feel and
I'm not gonna lie I love this place guys
but I found two bucks aside from that
though I'm having like the best time
ever I'm gonna go run down and go get
some guacamole and tacos with my guy
on my carpet in my basement silence bend
the roof the cigarettes and makeup baked
on that bus hi like they used to
don't make me
try try to make things right
come to work
you tell me that you cheated there you
messed up so obviously now back from the
Airbnb I'm actually I'm actually very
frustrated I'm trying to not be I had
already filmed a no trip to this video
and I found through the yoga flow that I
did in the second Airbnb but for some
reason I somehow lost the footage
somewhere along the way thus I am
refilling the outro first things first
when it came to walking Bentley it was
not much around that area I could have
walked to the distillery district it's
just kind of cool there wasn't that much
like nature and not only that when I
walked him at night I was a little a
little bit scared and then when it came
to yoga to the closest place to that
specific Airbnb like a 20 minute walk
away to do yoga so we decided to do yoga
just that morning and it was actually so
Zen and so nice the Sun was coming
through the window and then just with
the whole vibe of that place and the
plants I'm happy that I ended up doing
over there instead
but I'm so sad I lost the footage
because I was working on some really
cool stuff in terms of food the Mexican
place we went to was really really good
and I know so they're gonna restaurant
actually another Mexican one called El
Catrin it's in the Distillery District
and that is also amazing so when it
comes to food I'm gonna give that area
about 1/8 slowly because I love Mexican
food you give you give it you give me
guacamole and I'm happy asked her places
to walk that land I would say like a 2
star the cafe I went to is really cute
the lot tape is really good and the bad
that made it was super sweet so I'm
gonna give the cafe area like a 7 out of
10 and then in terms of the entire
apartment as a whole that size first of
all is definitely more suitable if you
maybe want so badly to kind of have a
bit more of a rustic style and so I'm
liking the idea of taking modern but
also taking aunt Cindy kind of that
style and meshing them together so it's
almost like taking my apartment now in
the Airbnb I was just in and mashing
them together that's what I'm asking the
universe for in terms of my next
apartment
as for the location I I think I'm gonna
have to give it a four
definitely don't think it's a location
for me you know just going back to my my
and just everything so accessible
there's parks and nature and the water
near me staying where I am in terms of
area Toronto is looking it's looking up
I might have to do a part two to this
video and try out some other areas of
Toronto so that's something you guys
want to see it leave a comment down
below or thumbs up this video but so far
I feel like I learned a lot from my
little staycation I hope you guys
enjoyed this video leave a comment down
below which Airbnb / style was your
guys's favorite and I will see you guys
all in my next video bye guys this is
right here is why I'm mad because my
other outro that I had already filmed I
was swinging and then I swung up and put
my hand over and now I just feel like I
feel like this is so easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
