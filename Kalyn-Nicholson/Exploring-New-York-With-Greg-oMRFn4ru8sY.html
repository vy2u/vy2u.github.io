that is fantastic
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm doing another
flock of you guys I'm actually in New
York we're here for two nights
I'm here with Gregory who I'm going to
try and force into this log as much as
humanly possible since that's what you
guys have been asking for
but we're here until Monday morning we
just got here it's Friday night like ApS
kind of raining outside which is putting
a little harsh on the mellow but that's
cool they brought an umbrella so we're
going to change into comfy shoes and I
think we're just going to explore Times
Square tonight and then take it easy
and I don't know what we're doing
tomorrow there what's the place they
said that was like this for the festival
mortgage mortgage board we're going a
mortgage where you marry I don't know
how long you guys depends on how long
you've been watching my channel that you
might know like the little history I
have with New York where it's like one
of my favorite places but like last year
I tried to come like three times and it
just kept on not working out so it feels
very good to be here
can I just say that because I feel like
it's still long overdue so I'm ready to
go for New York and I'm ready for you
taking around greggy's to live here for
like four months
so he knows all the hot places so you're
gonna be my little tour guide done well
you see what else is there to say aside
from the fact that I'm in New York
take the clock get a good morning New
York it is Saturday morning and you have
blessed us with some incredible weather
so yeah we woke up with all these plans
and then opened up the blinds and
realize that it was raining out so I
don't even think we have a plan you get
the plan right up everybody to the top
the rock we're singing and doing the top
of the rock but then we were like if
it's raining is there even gonna be of
you anyway good morning welcome today
this rule is officially day one let's go
get some smoothies
unless folks for me
what I know never been the best at
letting go and actually celebrating that
we got to the top of the rock
another thing stretched off the cycle is
where we going to go now countdown pop
the rock time square let's do this we're
going to this place called Josie so it's
Greg babe let me live here going to grab
the place and then we're going to go to
Brooklyn our plans have changed we have
to go find Dean I have to go got a nice
cold night brother
oh man
luckily we made it to Smorgasburg we're
going to eat a bunch of food which is
for sunny ml so if it's not a strain
island because you guys don't remember
when I was at Coachella and the Queen
Olympia's part about it I'm using the Q
super fluid UV depend Scott Lagasse f50
I usually use the one though after like
sensitive skin because I have a lot of
resistance you know in case I just over
and over on screen check I think we
should find a pineapple drink check and
I think we should go to Taco oh if we
got a taco that was like sushi roll
burrito things like tofu
Gregg it's got a tamale and another taco
and I feel like I don't know which one I
want to go for first
maybe the taco maybe I should wait for
Gregg stare at the Empire State Building
right now it is kind of filling up my
phone I'm going to go back to bed
staring down like he's going back for
chicken dumpling and I don't even know
where the rest of needs Mego
good morning guys and the happiest
Sunday the last day in New York we're
getting a pretty late start it's like
11:00 slept in a little bit I had a
little bit to drink last night and woke
up when I'm grab some Advil more carry
go catch a rib so I list of a vegan
restaurant because it was like one of my
things is that I wanted to try a vegan
place law is here so we're going to bike
through Central Park to this vegan place
called peace food I think and I'm going
to grab this a lot and it's not wash and
then we're going to go shopping okay
yeah bathing suit for LA and this hotel
is just so dark it looks like I'm
talking to you guys at night it's
actually 11 a.m. right now it's
ridiculous
after all my new shades that we bought
yesterday I don't even know if I blogged
that with you guys that we got new
shades yesterday I think it was just on
the live stream but I spent a vomit
amount of money on these but they look
pretty cool so it worked out and Gregg
got a pair too we're wearing new
sunglasses go for a bike ride through
Central West 3 let's go
because vlogging while biking is right
it's a little bit of a test you know
I stole it already I said I can make a
even anyone just too long for a
perfectly nice face
I start with on Bret Bielema go go
we are currently Chum in Central Park
Greg's trying to take a nap but failing
miserably probably cuz I keep talking
don't nod your head so plan we were
going to go check out Soho Soho area -
the new Nike stuff and yeah that's kind
of playing so far which is like playing
in Central Park with our bike checking
out all the little families everybody
here is so cute there's like people
doing yoga which people's like chillin
there's like kids running around on the
rock so - it's adorable makes me want to
have like a little family and like a dog
and just live in New York you know so it
is no Sunday night and the plans have
changed yet again like the millionth
time on this trip there's Mary Potter
mayor I thought on TV right now we're
both so tired from running around all
day that I think we're going to cancel
our fancy dinner and order in and get
like in comfy clothes and watch Harry
Potter you're like that that's the grand
decision which I'm very very happy with
it sounds so much better than getting
ready right now
I'm going to order a glass of wine
because Greg cannot drink tonight
Kendrick I just don't want Greg doesn't
want to drink tonight
and then we're going to order food I'm
going to get into my pajamas I'm going
to watch Harry Potter I'm literally so
happy with this decision paint now and
then our slice at like 7:00 a.m. on so
we're going to be up so early
it's probably about better thing anyway
so we can go to bed like earlier oh also
I've got new shoes the updates that you
missed through the day as I picked up
new running shoes because my old running
shoes are forgetting kind of bad what I
just want to mention that I think this
you did not pick these oh no you didn't
I just asked me I saw the word you those
directly mineral nitrogen
I picked the desert I picked that moment
you know my new running shoes that I
picked out and I tried them on at the
store and like ran on the treadmill
they're so comfy so I'm excited she's
like and we're gonna have to bring these
two a legs I'm gonna want to oh they're
gonna be perfect for when I go for runs
in LA working out so nicely Harry
Potter's on TV who is going to come I
got new running shoes to run off the
calories from all the food that's going
to come so I don't know what what else
you guys are going to see at the end of
this vlog it's probably going to be a
bunch of cut clips of food Harry Potter
and then flying home but like what else
what other better way to exit this vlog
am I right or am i right
