last night trying to at yesterday's
video oh my god I'm so tired
come on you gotta get cold enough to do
my bomb oh my god don't know you anymore
I don't understand my and uncle to me
please every spare depend on see they
stopped and going on I understand why
I'm so cool always taking some osama can
see a video or yesterday's vlog sorry is
officially live I think I'm gonna have
to start editing the videos or the vlogs
the next morning last two nights I've
been staying up to like almost 3 a.m.
edit if you guys are cool with into
upload then the day after because you
guys are awake to actually see them it
is currently a pretty foggy day in
Toronto I even know the temperature hold
on hey Siri what's the temperature
outside object rates right now
BRR I am going to make myself something
to eat now because I'm pretty hungry
let's eat some food she was just a go
all right
really goes to fit in this little and
wrong so it's getting pretty close to
four I feel like I haven't vlogged very
much today so I'm going to have to
definitely step my game up I need to get
my friend cat hi-yah we're vlogging we
don't really have much of a plan but I
want to show you guys so Mitrano and I
myself want to see some more of Toronto
and it looks like Rob's like talking
while driving before like we're going on
a drive together feel like I've been in
this crush forever okay hello I'm a boy
meet Nathan K we're gonna go back to my
place I totally forgot my sweater
I love you instead
using
a few
we don't really get to clear that much
of Toronto from being like that honest
of you I think our first mistake was
that we didn't really have much of a
game plan we tried to go to Kensington
Market couldn't find parking ended up
driving around we did like a good
driving tour of Toronto we walk around a
bit we walk by like the CN Tower grab
some like coffees and stuff and I'm
macho now I'm back home like a mini
tours like a nice little I don't know
I'm going to have to do another vlog
where it's like you guys can actually
follow me around trot out and I'll take
you guys to like some cool like vegan
places and stuff like that but I'm
actually freaking starving so I think
I'm going to make myself some dinner and
question is do I overeat or do I cook
Colligan over a burritos sounds mighty
fine I should cook I shouldn't do green
we're going to save money we're going to
save calories we're going to cook
probably the same rice stir fry I swear
to God I eat the same thing all the time
let me kiss if I told you Arlene I watch
you
oh so it is now getting pretty close to
the end of the night three hours editing
this vlog so that I don't have to spend
too much time doing it tomorrow because
there is a video that I'm doing tomorrow
it's actually with Apple music that I'm
super excited about basically David
vlogging you know I I just have to say
this like props to all of the youtubers
out there that actually do this on a
daily basis because I'm on day three and
I'm like mad stressed it's been quite
the learning process so I'm going to
make myself some oatmeal because I feel
like eating a warm hug I'm going to next
level if this little guy for the night
and probably watch some Netflix what do
you feel do we do narcos so you guys are
saying that you like that I ended my
last vlog with a Q&amp;amp;A so I actually got a
couple questions on Twitter today that
I'm going to answer with you guys
so marina wants to know how do I get out
of a rut my mood has really been
spiraling down and I just haven't been
myself lately
illy first of all I love you too and
second of all to get yourself out of a
rut my biggest recommendation is
definitely to change things up I
actually recently found myself in a bit
of a rut definitely more so creatively
but even in terms of just like working
out and eating healthy I definitely fell
into a rut Lee recently and the only
thing that seemed to push me out of it
and it's only been over the last two
days is doing a whole new routine trying
different workouts eating different
meals meal prepping different days
instead of Thursday and Sunday so that I
can just start changing things up a
little bit change up your routine
try something new get--oh ask an old
friend to go for coffee do something
that's going to change up your
atmosphere come back we'll pull you out
of the red even if it's just like
redecorating your Rosie wolf wants to
know how can I move on from someone
cheating I tried and I just keep looking
for my old relationship in my new ones
please help I feel like if you're still
looking for your old relationship in
your new one might be a good idea to
take a break I came out of a
relationship a bit over a year ago and I
pretty much decided shortly after that
relationship that I wanted to take like
a year to just be single and learn how
to be on my own gain confidence and all
of that fun stuff so I feel like take a
little break from dating so that you're
not looking for your old relationship
and new ones you're just kind of looking
for the relationship with yourself
sounds super cliche but trust me that
way when you are ready to look for a
relationship again you're not like
repeating the same mistakes you guys
want me to answer your questions in my
next vlog be sure to
into my Twitter or my tumblr I'm not
sure which one when they answer tomorrow
and go to sleep because we have super
early tomorrow
Miami palm trees in the breeze you're
the sweetest thing sweetest thing I've
ever seen
now that missing ocean esther's I feel
the light of the Moon dancing all the
way oh whoa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
