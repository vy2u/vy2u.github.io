laptop's god bless it's actually going
to force me to get that done which is
nice and I have no idea what I'm
actually going to do today I don't
really want to get a decaf latte guys
I'm not going to live and getting back
into this habit where I've been drinking
a lot of decaf latte by a lot I mean

to like stop doing it because it's like
preparing myself that when the 60 days

- okay we gotta go
oh boy
I am officially home
I actually got home a few hours ago Greg
finally like he's not here anymore so
he's on here to defend himself but Greg
has been making comments about how
uncomfortable my bed is I will admit
that I have a pretty crappy mattress
like it's the kind of matches where you
can feel the springs in your back while
you're sleeping and it's like one of
those things that when I first moved
into my first apartment I was just like
so excited about getting my first ever
bed and I felt like such a grown-up but
it didn't really care and I also didn't
spend want to spend like heaps of money
we didn't get a mattress today but he
did coax me into getting some new
pillows and I also got new sheets
because I'm in need of like some new
sheets those ones are getting pretty old
so I got like a new set of like eco like
bamboo sheets and they're supposed to
like keep you nice and cool kind of like
a long time ago I feel it was back in
March I was talking to you guys about
redoing my entire apartment and I feel
like I'm picking back up on that I'm
actually about to sell my couch it's
just like a lot of stuff that I want to
change in this apartment of the next
little bit and helps that by the fall
time it'll be exactly how I want it and
I can do like an updated apartment
towards you guys so tonight I feel like
I want to have like a super chill night
with Bentley I'm going to put all this
new stuff on my bed I want to try and
get a run if yeah and then I'll give you
guys one last little verbal update the
end of the song that is it for this vlog
I hope you guys enjoyed checking out the
rock the park festival with me and
Ontario Lottery and getting that whole
like cash for like VIP experience is
really cool and I always love like
vlogging these types of things and
sharing them with you because then I
feel like I can look back on them one
day and be like hey Greg remember that
time we went and met Fetty WAP pretty
cool time don't you think also we are
down to like two weeks until hashtag
feels comes out which is just a whole
other story I've been working on it like
crazy so getting a way to do things like
rock the park and being able to blog it
and make a video out of it for you guys
is super helpful for me because then I
don't feel like I'm just like out in the
dark leaving you guys with nothing god
bless so thumbs up if you guys want to
see some more vlogs I think I'm going to
start going back to doing a one weekly

my routine after field comes out that's
going to be like what I kind of strive
for until you Toby cuz I need to start
