Bentley is also with us today as it's so
cold and strong today that I put
Bentley's sweater on for a little walk
and he just like cuddled into it
Oh things fun hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm doing the 18th 19th the 19th
day of youtuber and I'm coming in hot
with a fall accessory slash little tiny
things that I bought for the remainder
of the fall time and also leaning into
the winter time even saying that hurts
my soul because I honestly cannot
comprehend where this year went but
everything in this video is like super
cozy or fall inspired and plus it just
takes the field photo shopping every
time I do haul videos or like also one
of my favorite to watch on YouTube if
you guys haven't already be sure to
check out my Twitter and my Instagram
where I probably already posted some
photos of this stuff and I've been
posting just a lot of fall content in
general so definitely come join the
coast crew and aside from that bitly no
dope you guys won't see all the fall
accessories that I purchased then just
keep watching some first things first I
picked up a book from chapters recently
so I figured I would start with this
because I'm going to be adding it to my
winter reading list you have purchased
this book before but lost it and one of
my moves
I looked for it everywhere and couldn't
find it so I went back two chapters and
picked it up again and it is called the
program by Suzanne yang I'm slowly
trying to collect a few books to read
through this winter Todd's taking me
like 5 years to read all of the books
that I actually own I've been trying to
be so friendly I've been trying to be so
good about not buying too many new books
before reading the books that I have so
this is one of the new ones that I
picked up and I'll tell you guys really
quickly what it's about
it says Sloane knows better than to cry
in front of anyone with suicide now an
international epidemic one outburst
could land her in the program the only
proven course of treatment Sloane's
parents have already lost one child
Sloane knows they'll do anything to keep
her alive she also knows that everyone
who's been through the program returns
as a blank slate because their
depression is gone but so are their
memories under constant supervillain s'
at home and at school
Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps
her feelings very
deep as she can the only person Sloane
can be yourself with is James he's
promised to keep them both safe and out
of treatment and Sloane knows that their
love is strong enough to withstand
anything but despite the promises
they've made to each other it's getting
harder to hide the truth they are both
growing weaker depression is setting in
so I've looked at reviews on this before
and apparently it's a good book to read
for anyone that kind of has suffered or
suffers with anxiety and depression oh
if you guys want I can keep you updated
on if it's good or not or if you should
check it out
just let me know down in the comments if
you guys want me to I can totally do
that
next I'm gonna share with you guys this
stuff I got from Urban Outfitters
starting with these I actually picked
these up in San Francisco but I haven't
shown them to you guys yet so I threw
them in here since there's some other
stuff from Urban Outfitters that I want
to show you guys when I saw these my
brining just stopped working it was like
overlaps because I didn't know I needed
something so perfect in my life until I
saw they are just these pointed toe like
fake suede forest green boots and I'm so
obsessed with these these are so cute
for the fall time but I also feel like
you can so easily roll these into like
winter and Christmas because of the
color on them I'm not gonna lie the
first day I wore them I got pretty bad
blisters but I've broken them in now so
they don't give me blisters anymore and
I'm freaking obsessed and then next time
Urban Outfitters I decided to pick up
two candles now I have like a ledge if
you guys have seen my apartments where I
posted it recently I'll pop it up on the
screen here but I have a ledge over in
my bedroom and I like to do my reading
in here so I like all of my candles at
nighttime and try and get a chapter done
at night I decided to splurge on some
candles and really cozy up like the
candle area that I have envisioned in my
mind so I'll show you what they look
like I just kept them in the packaging
because I don't know
I thought the packaging was kind of cool
I might use these in my kitchen so this
is what they look like they're like pre
drip - they're super festive for the
full time but again I feel like these
could be super cozy even leading into
like the holidays they actually smell
like really good I think this scent is
just called bear I don't know it says
bear on there but apparently hand
dripped candles are so cute I feel like
I'm probably gonna go on and buy more
but these are the two candles that I
picked up next to Urban Outfitters I
picked up just a hat as you guys know I
have my black floppy hat but I wanted to
one in this color so I saw this one on
the website of Urban Outfitters and
decided to pick it up I'll show you guys
what it looks like on obviously not with
this outfit I feel like I look like a
like a farmer right now and I don't have
one in this color I feel like also it
could work for a scarecrow costume if
you're looking to like you know dabble
at that for Halloween it just in general
I thought it'd be super cute for the
fall time and I was a little cautious as
to whether it would look okay
considering my hair is lighter like I
feel like this would look so bomb on
someone with dark hair life's too short
to not wear what you just want to wear
you know and then the last thing that I
purchased from Urban Outfitters was this
cardigan here a ton of you guys were
tweeting me asking me about it because I
posted it to my snapchat if you guys
aren't following me is just my name but
this is what it looks like here I'll try
it on really quickly for you guys a
comfy AF and I know that this is kind of
more of like a clothing piece but it's
kind of like an accessory to because
like you throw it on you can cozy on up
and it read books but you can also wear
it out and get super festive and cute
and I love it because the sleeves are
just like like I just feel so I feel
like the epitome of COEs right now you
know all I want to do right now it's
light up these candles read this book
and wear this cardigan I think I've seen
quite a few people rocking this lately
too but its massive it's oversized it's
comfy so I can see why everybody's
obsessive it because I sure in also if
you're curious about the jacket that I
actually am wearing you could see this
on coats very soon so the last place I
have to show you guys some accessories
from is forever 21 starting off with
this hat here which means I'm gonna have
to think of this again decided to pick
up one of these hats and I'm honestly
I'm kind of in love with it
I feel like a mixture between like a
railroad worker and Christina Aguilera
circa the 90s again with the faux like
suede material and it's in that burnt
again with the burnt orange but it is so
cute answer forever 21 so I'm pretty
sure it was like 12 bucks the next thing
I'd purchase from forever 21 is this
backpack and I'm not gonna lie when I
purchased it I thought it was going to
be faux leather it's not but I needed a
good little carry-on because I'm going
to be doing some traveling over the next
few months and so I wanted something
that was super easy and compact that you
can bring on the plane but you can also
use when you're traveling that's not
going to totally clash with your outfit
the little backpack I have right now
always pink and so while it's adorable I
hate actually wearing it because it
doesn't match with what I'm wearing I
know that sounds lame but I am like very
particular about how things match each
other when I'm rocking an outfit so I
decided to pick this up just because it
was black it was studded and it would
match a lot more things when traveling
or if you're going into like an
amusement park I'm going to the
Halloween Haunt and wonderland and
things like this are perfect because you
can keep everything inside and it's
secure but you're not like wearing a
purse you know what I mean I also
decided to pick up this scarf here it's
a giant massive blanket scarf in burnt
orange I feel like it's just not even a
surprise anymore you're like this is
such a fine I've been looking for a
giant burnt orange like blanket scarf
for so long and everywhere I go they're
all sold out they have like burgundy
gray white but they never have this
color it's massive enough that you could
wear it like a poncho you could wear it
like an actual scarf or this is gonna be
perfect again for traveling because it's
like you could even take it off and wear
it as a blanket you can even wear it
like if you wanted to scare somebody
what more could you want from life that
is the blanket scarf that I picked up
from forever 21 you're probably gonna
see me rock this so much and then I've
been seeing these shoes everywhere and I
wasn't sure if I was gonna like them on
me or not so that's why I decided to try
them from forever 21 first I went about
spending a super ridiculous amount of
money on shoes that I might potentially
hate they're like these slide on like
loafers loafs I don't know but first
sound weird so I feel like it's like
you're actually putting a loaf of bread
on your feet which in a lot of ways I
don't know why but that seems fitting so
I picked these ones up from forever 21
they're almost like a purple burgundy
more on the purple side than Burgundy
but they're also something you could
wear into the holidays because of the
color like to see what do you see what
we're doing here so they were super
cheap and if you guys want to see how I
would style thee I can make sure to put
them in some future outfit videos coming
up just let me know and then this piece
here again it's more of a clothing piece
than an accessory but I would still kind
of consider it an accessory I decided to
pick up this overall dress from forever
21 it's in a black kind of corduroy and
this is
again just one of those things that you
find and you're like I didn't even know
I needed you until you entered my life
this is another piece that I rocked in
yesterday's episode the week video so
definitely check that out if you want to
see how it style it but it's just this
really nice black corduroy dress it's
got pockets it's got everything you
could want from it and again it's
festive enough to wear right now but the
material and the color bring it on into
the winter so long as you layer it with
sweaters and stocking so the next thing
I decided to pick up from forever 21
which is something I didn't even know
they like carried or sold or these
decorative lights they're little lantern
lights I'll pop them open so you guys
can see they are just these silver
lanterns and they are battery-operated
so you could put them anywhere you want
you don't have to put them near like an
outlet so this is what they look like
they're just cute little lanterns I mean
I've been pulling out all the string
lights lately I feel like it's just that
time of year where you just want to put
string lights all over because it it
just infuses such a coziness to your
vibe so I definitely wanted to pick up
more for some places that I couldn't
plug them in it was just a bonus that
forever 21 sold them because who knew
the next thing I picked up from forever
21 was this bag here because
unfortunately one of my favorite black
person recently broke so I needed to
replace it with a new one and I should
really enjoy the purses from forever 21
I'm not normally one of those people
that likes to splurge a lot on purses I
feel like when I have the money to spend
I'd rather spend it on burritos and
random things like hand dripped candles
and anything burnt orange so when I saw
this purse I decided to pick it up
because I feel like it's the perfect
size too for holding everything you need
but not being too big like this will
hold my wallet my cell phone and
possibly my vlog camera perfectly and
that's all I could really want from a
purse and then last but not least I
picked up one more pair of shoes they
are these ones here and might I say
they're probably my favorite thing in
this whole haul
so these shoes are more on the expensive
side from forever 21
they were 45 90 but again I'm going to
get so much use out of these they're
kind of like rubber like rubber boot
material but they're little sneakers and
they have studs all around like the
outsides of them I don't know if you
guys can see and then they just lace up
in the front I don't know why but these
are most
like things ever I've been waiting to
film this video slowly so I could pull
these out and actually start wearing
them so you're definitely gonna be
seeing a lot of them they're just like
the perfect amount of edgy and stylish
but also just weird so those are the
shoes that I picked up so that concludes
my fault accessory haul be sure to leave
a comment down below telling me your
favorite thing from this haul I like I
said I feel like it would either have to
be the shoes in the cardigan for me and
also let me know if you guys enjoyed the
accessory haul versus just like clothing
hauls I know normally when I buy clothes
I always do a haul with you guys but one
of my secret guilty pleasures is buying
really weird knickknacks like this and
books string lights for my apartment so
if you guys like these kinds of videos
definitely let me know because I'll
start filming these kinds of hauls - and
now that I hope you guys enjoyed today's
video I love you guys to the moon back
and I'll see you guys all for youtuber
day 20 that's insane how is it going so
fast this is the story of the river in
jail
and what she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her when she's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
