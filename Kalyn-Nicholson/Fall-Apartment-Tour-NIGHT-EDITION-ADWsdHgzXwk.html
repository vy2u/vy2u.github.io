we are officially breaking the halfway
point I know how it's going so fast but
here we are for today's video I'm going
to be doing an updated fall apartment
tour to change it up this time
I'm doing it at night so I decorated my
apartment quite a lot actually for the
fall time and I wanted to give you guys
a tour just to get you guys in that like
fall esque cozy mood and also because
there's actually been a lot of changes
to my apartment that you guys haven't
seen yet but I wanted to change it up
because there's so many string lights in
my apartment and because honestly my
favorite vibe in this apartment is
nighttime I figured it would be fun and
kind of different to film an apartment
tour at nighttime instead honestly it
would be a lot better if y'all could
just you know bring your PJs your mugs I
have the pumpkin spice marshmallows we
can make mochas watch scary movies here
at nighttime but I guess we'll have to
settle for this for now so if you guys
want a tour of my apartment during the
night time then just keep watching
so when you first walk into my apartment
this is the view that you see
specifically at nighttime I have so much
fall decor up right now it's kind of
insane when you first walk in and you
turn to your right I have this skull
frame which you guys have asked me about
a lot I actually picked it up from home
sense and then just below it I have this
little stool that I also got from
HomeSense and I just keep my purse on
there and like my most worn shoes that
I'm wearing that week I'll keep them
there too so it just keeps it kind of
separate and easy and then right beside
that is my kitchen area on top of my
fridge you'll notice that I put a bunch
of fall photos I think I want to switch
these out kind of like a mood board for
each month and then I have my little
good-luck elephant on top that I got
from the Dominican Republic it's
supposed to bring good luck to your home
and then I have a pretty standard
kitchen like you know microwave oven
things like that I decorated with little
pumpkins and I put happy Halloween in my
little coffee sign but yeah this is like
my coffee station I have a Keurig and
then up here this is my mug collection
except a few of them they're missing
some in the dishwasher and then I
decided to string up these orange lights
that I got from the dollar store they
were in my tub that I brought over when
I moved from my old apartment so I
strung those there and then in the
middle on this little like food platter
I keep three of my favorite mugs for the
season and yeah it's just like a nice
little way to decorate and then beside
that I have just a little pumpkin and
two more candles you're gonna notice
that my apartment is just flooded with
candles then I have this little fake
plant here and three clocks that I
picked up from society6 I did a video
where I've redecorated my apartment I'll
pop it up on the screen here if you guys
want to check it out but all the
society6 stuff is in there and then
right now I have the pumpkin cupcakes
soap I switched out all of my soaps for
the fall too and then over to the side I
just have a little pumpkin some
placemats
and hello sugar bye bath money works and
it's supposed to feel like
and so I actually picked up this apron
from Amazon it kind of reminds me of The
Nightmare Before Christmas so I hung it
up since I've been doing a lot of fall
baking and then I have this little
thankful banner that I also got from
home sent a lot of the stuff in this
apartment hall or apartment or saris
from home cents I have this little
bookshelf over here too it has my
Beatles lunchbox and some vintage
cameras and stuff like that the
bookshelf itself is from Walmart and
you'll notice that I've wilting dead
flowers you know to go with the
Halloween theme and then there's just a
bunch of random stuff in this
bookshelves a lot of books and old
journals and things like that
and nothing too crazy or too special so
just beside there under the nightstand
beside the couch I just keep Bentley's
toy box and he likes to like dig in
there and pull out all of his favorites
and in front of that I keep my record
collection which I've also done a video
on before if you guys want I will also
pop that up on the screen then I just
have my record player and my lamp my
reading lamps that I picked up from Ikea
and my couch is right beside that which
is also from Ikea and I just decorated
with a bunch of pillows and blankets as
you would considering it's a couch and
above that I have in my world map
tapestry which is from society6 and I
strung some string lights around that as
well so most of the pillows on my couch
are actually from society6 too aside
from in the middle the little fur ones
are from home scents as well as the
autumn pillow but everything else on
here is pretty much from society6 aside
from over on this side this is where
Bentley likes to hang out he like took
over the chaise lounge and so I put my
heated blanket over it and turn it on in
the dates that it gets cold and stuff
and Bentley likes to lay there so it's
become his spot
beside that is just my coffee table
which is also from Ikea along with the
gray shade rug underneath it and then on
top of my coffee table I just keep this
little like tray that I got from home
cents and on it I have sweater weather I
have warm tobacco pipe which used to be
a candle and want to empty it out I put
a fake plant inside as well as this fake
cactus in this little like I don't even
know what to call this like lantern
thing and then inside of my coffee table
I just figured I'd show you guys this is
this French newspaper from when Elena
and I were in Paris and then I keep this
little candle top as a coaster for my
coffee in the morning time and then
obviously across from the coffee table
and couch is my TV area at the very top
I have this little silver moose from
home cents then of course I have my TV
and then the TV stand itself is also
something I get questions about a lot
it's from Walmart and all of the decor
on it is pretty much from home cents
aside from the pumpkin and the bath and
Bodyworks candle so basically the two
only other things on here and then on
the other side of my living room there
is this little fireplace I got this from
Rona quite a few years ago and on top I
have my little black serious black
pumpkin my fall reads this year all the
books that I'm trying to read for the
fall time or have read and then I keep
my two candles and candlestick holders
also from home cents and then above that
be three prints that I have are from
society6
so obviously beside that it's just my
patio and then beside my patio I have
this white chair that I got up and
Kijiji I have no idea where the girl had
it from but I bought it off of just
basically a random stranger and then I
put this grey blanket over top of it
this is also Bentley spot and then
beside that I have my mirror from Ikea I
just put some string lights around it
from Urban Outfitters and then I have
this little vase or Vaz from Target back
when Target was actually in Canada and I
put two white roses and an orange flower
and of course my Harry Potter one from
when I went to play was live we did like
the universal tour or whatever and so I
bought this Elder Wand from Diagon Alley
so I keep that there like year round not
even just because it's fall and then I
have this glass pumpkin from home cents
as well as you can tell I obviously love
home scents and then right beside that
is my bedroom this is like what you
first see when you pan over and then
once you walk in I have all of my string
lights plugged in so over to the left
I'll start with the closet honestly it's
super boring in this closet aside from
like my makeup drawers so that's where
my makeup drawers and my hamper is and
then just a bunch of random stuff that
I've organized up at the top beside that
I have my dream catcher which I actually
recently moved over closer to my bed but
this is where it was when I filmed it
and then I have my desk I've done a desk
tour video recently for you guys if you
want to see the full organization then
I'll pop it up on the screen but I just
have like my water bottle my dry erase
calendar my fake plants and my real
plants my little you know wire like fish
wire bulletin board candles all of the
good stuff like I said I'll post my desk
tour so if you guys want to see fully
what's in here then you can but this is
pretty much my workstation and then
underneath I just have a little floor
pillow for Bentley and the chair and
desk itself are all from Ikea and then
off to the side I have my TV and a
little Catholic candle you know lantern
area my favorite part about this
apartment is the view from this room
which is why I moved my bedroom over
here and basically I just completely
filled it with string lights and candles
to make it super cozy including all the
pillows on my bed most of them are
actually from society6 so the happy
haunting one and the orange one and the
little pumpkin are from home
and then everything else is society6 my
dream sign is something I got for
Christmas last year but I believe it's
from indigo and then the prints above my
bed are from society6 as well the candy
cane garland is from home scents and
then the lights are from urban
outfitters which i picked up last year
and then on my nightstand I have this
little vampire canvas that I also got
from home since and this Lantern that I
picked up I believe from Bed Bath and
Beyond and it can charge your phone
which is super cool and then just more
candles and another mirror so that is
pretty much my entire bedroom I swear to
god guys this video is not like
sponsored by HomeSense I just I shop
there a lot and then the one thing I
forgot to show you guys was the stools
that I have this is also my popcorn
machine and where Bentley's kennel goes
and then once you turn left you have my
little laundry area which is kind of
completely irrelevant but I made a dream
board on the door which is another video
I did and I'll pop that up on the screen
and then to the left is the first
bathroom so this is the one that most
like guests and stuff use and I use more
so on a daily basis because it's closer
to my bedroom but the other bathroom is
the one that I actually shower in and
have a lot of my products in
and then across from that bathroom is my
closet which I've also done a closet
tour I'll pop that up as the last video
on the screen but if you guys want a
more in-depth tour of this room then
definitely check out that video but a
little overview is basically this is
where I keep all of my clothes and a lot
of my code stuff as well so the actual
carpeting that you see is from society 6
and then the closet sectional I got from
Ikea
I keep jackets on the right side and
then dresses and rompers on the left
side it's kind of how I have it
organized for fall along with all of
like my shoes and then there's buckets
in the bottom for sweaters pants and
things like that and then in here I keep
all of like my PJs my extra bags my
sweaters and my more athletic wear and
then I used this desk when it comes to
working for coves and keeping all of my
electronics and COEs things on top so
all that was left was one last bit that
I need to send over to the shipping
place and then over to the right is just
more shoes and where I keep my tripod
and an extra bed for Bentley and the
last room in this apartment tour is the
second bathroom so this bedroom is
actually technically like the ensuite or
whatever because it comes with the or
the master I guess you would say because
it comes with the ensuite bathroom but I
prefer the other bedroom because of the
view that said this is the bathroom that
I still use when it comes to showering
tanning doing my makeup and getting
ready so most of my products and things
are left in here including like my
elastics this is how I keep my elastics
organized you know when you have like
your good elastics those are them and I
keep the bed there because as you can
see Bentley likes to follow me in here
so yeah this is basically the bathroom
that has like my tanning supplies and
all the things that I use on a daily
basis so I still use this one quite a
bit even though this is no longer my
bedroom which all-in-all means that that
is it for the tour I'm gonna flick off
all the lights one last time to give you
guys one last overview of what it looks
like in the actual night time with all
all the overhead lights so you guys get
the full cozy you know essence of it
before I leave
so that is it for my fall apart mentor
and hope you guys enjoy and aside from
that I love you guys coming back and
I'll see you guys all in tomorrow's
video bye guys some body won't told me
the world is gonna roll me I ain't the
sharpest tool in the shed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
