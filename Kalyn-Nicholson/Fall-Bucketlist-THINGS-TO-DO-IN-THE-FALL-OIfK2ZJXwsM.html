guys what's up and welcome back to my
channel for today's video we are
officially on this seventh day of each
other which means we are already a
weekend which kind of blows my mind
because I don't know how we're already a
week into October but nonetheless here
we are and for today's video I'm doing a
fall bucket list with you guys I figured
I would mesh kind of like a things to do
in the fall with a bit more of a
challenge aspect to it because I mean
every season we always said that there's
so many things we want to do and then we
never get around to actually doing them
so I challenged myself to fulfill my
fall bucket list so whether you guys
just use this as like inspiration for
things to do in the fall or you decide
to take on the fall bucket list
challenge definitely be sure to tweet
and Instagram anything on this list at
me so I can see and I'll leave my
tournament Instagram right here on the
screen so you guys can come follow me
and check it out I've been posting a ton
of false stuff already so definitely
come you know the codes crew like fall
fan aside from that there are quite a
few things that we need to do in this
fall by the list you know challenge so
let's begin shall we
first things first fall wouldn't be fall
without a Harry Potter marathon
pop up some popcorn put on a Harry
Potter wear the outfit and that's have a
marathon
I'm gonna be down day two Harry Potter
three so yeah that was pretty much the
most epic day that I've spent probably
so far yet this fall I haven't finished
the rest of the movies yet only because
I'm still reading the fourth one so
there you have it number two on my
bucket list for the fall was to make my
own DIY pumpkin spice latte so it's
already October and I have yet to make a
pumpkin spice latte at home there are
places I'm sure inshallah that do you
beacon pumpkin spice but I haven't had a
life so the moral of the story is we're
about to make a pumpkin spice latte so I
mean to start depending on how much
caffeine you want you could go ahead and
were yourself espresso or coffee I'm
gonna start by burying myself a cup of
coffee because I've already had two
coffees today so I need
next I'm going to start by creaming my
coffee and I'm using the silk almond for
coffee creamer and I'm using the vanilla
one I mean they do have a hazelnut one
too that would work if you're looking
for a bit more of like a cinnamony
hazelnut
pumpkin spice but I like the vanilla for
pumpkin spice lattes because it's more
of like a pumpkin cupcake latte you feel
for the rest of the ingredients I'm just
gonna put them as overlays just to make
this nice and easy for you guys and so I
don't bore you with my
oh my god dude this is better than what
I remember Starbucks pumpkin spices
tasting like it literally tastes like a
pumpkin cupcake mix with coffee all the
best things in life and of course what
is fall
to where our Moscow
a lot is do never
in about the place on our
somehow get the feeling and I'm done
but I
I'll become
Oh
so next time I file bucket list was to
make pumpkin pie because it's my
favorite dessert in the fall time but
you can make your favorite fall dessert
but either way I made some pumpkin pie
and because it is the season for
football and I am like a closeted
football fan that Greg and I decided to
go you know play some football I'm
supposed to call you but don't know what
to say you know she wants me
you know I feel like Halloween and fall
isn't Halloween and fall unless you
spend a good two hours getting elbow
deep into a pumpkin
so of course how could we leave carving
pumpkins bottomless beauty sights for my
monster for his slab began to rise and
suddenly
I'm so impressed by this which one's
your favorite I think he likes mine
better which one's your favorite
mine mine definitely just set mine dad
whoops flips and in the spirit of thanks
and giving I feel like it's important to
give back to ourselves so sunflowers are
actually my favorite flower which kind
of makes sense I had to buy myself some
sunflowers so whilst grocery shopping
today look could I just happen to
stumble upon just another chick off the
fall bucket list not gonna lie I don't
think I have a vaz for these so we're
gonna have to get a little creative
and of course you can't get into the
fall festive mood or mode if your
environment isn't quite as full festive
and as fall mode as you are so next on
the list is to decorate for the fall or
Halloween or on whatever
and last but not least on my fall bucket
list was to make a Thanksgiving dinner
now Thanksgiving in Canada is a little
earlier than you guys over in the States
and Greg and I had never had a
Thanksgiving together yet so we did just
that we made a vegan Thanksgiving dinner
not looking pretty I picked up like we
were like a vegan ham roast so we're
making all the things
you know it's nothing man use never good
time
so those are all the things on my fall
bucket list this year slash some things
to do in the fall for you guys let me
know if you guys decide to take on the
challenge or do anything in this video
my tagging me are commenting down below
I'm also curious what is your guys's
favorite activity to do in the fall I
think for me mine is either carving
pumpkins or having movie marathons like
cozy fall nights in with like scary
movies and stuff or apple-picking big
thumbs up if you guys have been enjoying
all the videos with that said I will see
you guys tomorrow
happy fall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
