video I'm going to be doing a fall
closet tour with you guys along with
sharing a bunch of staples that are like
needs to have in your closet for the
fall time just the other day I actually
reorganized my entire closet I got
everything all clean it became a pigsty
I wish I had taken before shots you know
maybe I can find some in some old vlog
footage but it's safe to say that it was
a hot freaking mess and so the other day
I took a few hours sat down blared some
tooth and clean the crap out of it
organized it all don't need it a bunch
of old clothes and established my entire
closet with all of my clothes ready to
go for the fall time if you guys aren't
following me already be sure to check
out my Twitter and my Instagram and also
subscribe if you guys aren't early part
of the coast crew fan because my too
cozy in here and there's room for mole
and other than that if you guys want to
see a phone closet or with some
suggestions of staples you need in your
closet for the Fall then just keep
watching
so first things first this room is a
closet room but I also use it as a bit
of an office slash Distribution Center
fucose but when you first walk in you
see my guitar here
I've had this guitar forever I got it
for Christmas a few years ago I still
play it actually daily surprisingly
something you guys might not know I
didn't have anywhere else to put it so I
just kind of put it there so when you
walk in we'll go right from the first
corner so this is the built-in closet
that came with this bedroom starting
from the top I just have my laundry
essentials there just because the
laundry room is literally right here so
it just makes it easy and accessible
beside that I have this big giant
two-faced box from when they did their
peach campaign and inside of there I
have belts extra little clutches and
bags as well as some scarves and then
beside that I just have a bunch of
purses this is where I keep all of my
purses I tried to minimize the amount of
bags that I have I have this pink one
here from forever 21 this backpack from
H&amp;amp;M for when I do my work in cafes and
stuff this is my duffel bag that I got
from forever 21 this is I think also
from forever 21 as well that one is from
H&amp;amp;M and then that one I think is from
Lulu sand scrolling down right here this
hanger just has all of my sports bras on
it so I just hang all of them on here to
make them nice and easy
you know the cleanest ones from the top
and that way throughout the week I just
kind of picked through them since I do
work out quite a bit so I end up making
through most of them before I do my
laundry and then restock the hanger and
then beside that I just have a bunch of
clothes and colors that I don't normally
wear if you guys have never noticed
before my wardrobe is very much black
speech is Browns grays and I don't tend
to veer far from those colors but did
the few extra colors I do have are like
reds navies and a bit of like pastel
blues and such and so I just keep those
hung up in here since they are just kind
of like bonus or extra dresses and then
in this little shelving unit I'll go
through each and every shelf and tell
you guys what's on all of them starting
at the top but these are just my bra
let's I keep them here just to keep them
out of the way of where I keep my bras
because I don't know it just seems a lot
easier and sometimes I'll just wear bra
let says tops when I'm home just
chillin by myself and then this section
is my PJs these are all just like big
oversized t-shirts and comfy pajamas
shirts and things like that with a
couple cute like silky ones and then
here are just all of my pajama shorts
think I've mentioned to you guys before
I don't like wearing pants to bed that
said I do have two pairs of pajama pants
at the very bottom but they're more so
for Christmastime I just wear shorts all
the time so these are all my comfy like
lounging shorts the next shelf is lounge
sweaters and sweatpants pretty
self-explanatory I downgraded all of my
sweatpants so these are actually all of
them here I have two pairs of black one
pair of Burgundy a pair from Lulu's a
pair from roots and a pair from
Abercrombie which is also grey aside
from that I just don't want myself buy
any more sweatpants because they take up
so much room and to be honest I don't
wear sweatpants all that often I usually
wear leggings instead and then as for
lounge sweaters I had to downgrade
because this was overflowing I do tend
to hang out a lot in like loungy comfy
sweaters but I've made it a new rule
that anytime I buy anything for my
closet now I have to swap it out for
something else in here I just have like
my crop sweaters at the top and then I
have just some basic like adidas
sweaters and hoodies and things like
that the rest of my hoodies and such are
actually in my bedrooms or pullovers
whereas the one in ones in my bedroom
are zip up and then moving down a shelf
this is all my fitness gear again I
downgraded all of this just the other
day when I was doing my reorganizing
because realistically I did not need you
know 15 pairs of leggings for working
out so again these are all my bottoms I
just have leggings I have yoga pants at
the very bottom and then just all of my
leggings and then my shorts on top and
all of my workout tops with the t-shirts
at the bottom and tank tops towards the
top and one shelf lower this is just my
Wii and my drone because I don't have
anywhere else to put it so and then I
just keep my workout shoes here because
it's right by my workout shelf then
moving over I have this little
three-tier shelf thing that I've
actually had for ever top drawer I keep
browsing underwears which is why I
probably won't show you guys that one
this Shore I'm actually extremely proud
of this is my bathing suit drawer which
I have organized bottoms on this side
and tops on this side and they're
actually coordinated
side-by-side in the middle I just have
extra straps for bathing suits I have my
bathing suit like cover up and then I
have a bathing suit bag and then I have
all my one pieces in the middle maybe
next summer or for spring break next
year I'll do like a full video on all of
my bathing suits and then the bottom
drawer which might not even open because
it's stuffed full has all of my shorts
here and all of my short skirts here and
including my fall ones and all my jean
shorts and stuff like that and then on
top of this we just have this is where
Bentley's clothes are kept he has one
other sweater that's in the wash right
now but I just keep his stuff here in
this little woven basket I keep all of
my workout socks and then you guys can't
really tell because of these clothes but
I keep all of my extra hats I have my
beanie I have two black caps a flat top
hat that's grey one for vacationing
that's women and then a black one for
vacation as well and so that is the
first section of this closet and then
moving on I'm not going to show you guys
too much on this side because it's super
boring to be honest with you guys in the
top I just keep extra blankets pillows
tapestries all of my towels and then
this shelf is just stuff for videos that
I have coming up like these are for a
DIY I have a notebooks video coming up
for you Tober some extra makeup stuff
that I have my candles again just like
miscellaneous things like my Polaroid
camera and some printer paper and then
the bottom shelf is a bunch of extra
books that I don't have out in my living
room so completely irrelevant and so
that completes that side of the closet
and then moving on you guys will have
seen this in past videos if you've
watched my old fall closet tour but this
closet sectional I have is just from
Ikea I picked it up for my last
apartment and it's still the same one so
on the top I just keep all of my extra
shoes that I don't need to grab for like
a lot of high heels and extra booties
and things that are maybe a bit more out
of season and then my way of organizing
the racks here is on the left side
you'll notice I have all of my dresses
and rompers and on the right side it
goes from long jackets all the way to
shorter jackets and then to a couple
sweaters and nicer tops that I like to
keep hung up and this goes as far as
even the shoes on the left side you'll
notice it's all of like my tan and like
colored booties and then on the right
side all of my black booties
and then moving down to the last section
all four of these tubs are coordinated
as well for clothing but starting up at
the top I will start from the left side
goes from black to like black whites to
Gray's to whites to a pinky tones to
oranges to Burgundy and then on this
side I have all my jackets coordinated
from length and then I move into shorter
jackets but fake leather ones then more
bomber style than jean jacket then fur
than sweaters then longer tops in the
back I have all of my thigh highs and
like I don't know taller booties and
then in the front I have like my two
most worn pairs my favorite these are
like my good luck booties don't ask and
a pair of my favorite heels in the like
tan color and then on the other side
where all my black booties are again I
have all of my most worn ones and the
friends well of some of my newer pairs
and then I have my taller ones in the
bat and two thighs that are black and
then as for the bins underneath this bin
here is all of my pants and bottoms I
have them organized as jeans in the back
and then these are material pants in the
front the organization for this one is
these are all of my like crop tops my
super nice like going out tops and
things like that these are all of my
body suits in the middle and then this
side here are non crop tops but they're
still really nice tops like not
something you would lounge around your
apartment in really nice like blouses
and things like that like silk tank tops
and such so that is how I organize my
tops and then moving on to the next bin
this one here is all of my lounge slash
printed tops is long-sleeve versus short
sleeves so those are where all of my leg
graphic tees are from Led Zeppelin to
ac/dc tops which you guys have seen a
million times before and then basically
same thing on this side but just long
sleeve as well as kind of like sweater
tops or just more cozy you know like
knitted tops and things like that
and then the last bin I have all of my
maxi dresses on this side and all of my
maxi skirts on this side and then moving
on you're gonna notice that I have these
two stacked bookshelves here that are
actually from Walmart they split in the
middle as you can see right here again
with this I just keep a bunch of extra
shoes some of like my favorites are up
on the top I think I've been telling you
guys this forever but I got these shoes
forever ago I never got a chance to wear
them so I
I'm just gonna save them for my wedding
day because look at how epic they are
they're like the most gorgeous pair of
shoes in the world and then I just have
some of my other favorites like my big
giant burgundy ones up here pumps some
Burgundy shoes and then it moves into my
sneakers I have my Adidas sneakers some
Nikes my converse as well as like my red
high-tops and then just some extras at
the bottom they're like silver and red
for the holidays and brown for you know
vacations and then an extra pair like
those are the comfiest black heels
you'll ever wear and of course how could
we forget I like to keep this hat out
just because I feel like one it adds to
the closet and - I got it in Paris and
it's my favorite hat ever so I just like
to keep it out and make it easily
accessible out here I just have a patio
with my hammock the rug I have in here
it's from society6 and then scrolling up
I just have my K and my end from when I
went to Toronto Film Festival last year
it's attached to a bathroom which is the
actual bathroom that I use so I usually
have a candle burning in here at all
times and then I have all of my products
sup guys I have all of my products in
here that I actually use and I have all
of my shower products in here as well
because this is where I shower looting
my little speaker there but this is kind
of irrelevant to my fall closet so let's
move back out so coming into the
bathroom the last section I have to show
you guys in my closet tour is my I like
to call this my little cozy work section
I'm planning on getting another canvas
like this but I actually want to get the
COEs logo across it this is literally
where I do all of my COEs work so
hanging up again I've had this for
forever but it's just a picture of a
bridge and I strung some lights from
Urban Outfitters across here you guys
are gonna notice this is a bunch of
stock for COEs so that's what's in all
of these boxes including on the top and
then in front I just have all of my
shipping materials because as of right
now I'm shipping out all the codes items
myself not expecting codes to do as well
as it did so shipping everything out has
been absolutely insane guide you're
gonna notice also there's a bunch of
mugs that came in for orders this week
that are chilling on top of the desk so
I have to ship those out tonight but
yeah this is like the little desk slash
work section for cozy I even have my
workbook here this is my orders book
that I write
all of the COEs orders and so that I can
get them ready and shipped and then I
have a little like media section here
that is unrelated it's just just where I
keep my extra lenses my microphone and
my little gorilla pods for vlogging and
again just more Co stuff this is like
the little slip you get when you make a
COEs order all of the Coast stickers for
the shipping and then on the bottom
there I just have the printer I bring my
laptop in here when I'm doing all the
codes work and I just sit this desk and
get it all you know sectioned off and
ready and yeah actually have Marcos
merchandise coming in today so this
section is about to get a lot more
hectic it's like a little closet slash
office space slash distribution center
and so that is it for a general closet
tour and how I've decided to reorganize
everything and so without further ado
let's jump into these staples for your
closet for the fall time
so when it comes to stocking your closet
for the fall time for hats I would start
by getting a black beanie and a black
flat cap because I don't think you're
gonna need anything else aside from that
when it comes to the hat department and
with jackets being my go-to for this
fall time my to stock or staples would
be a good you know fake leather jacket
for going out and also a nice trench
coat because trench coats
and what is fall without booties or
shoes these are like my go-to they're
actually from urban planet they were
twenty bucks but having a good set of
black booties is essential for the fall
time as well as a good pair of sneakers
and my faves are these dark grey
converse that I got last year as well
and my last staples for the fall time
would be at 1:00 a good knit sweater
that you can wear that's comfy went with
nice clothes and with more lounging
clothes and then of course how can we
forget a good lounge sweater - I love
having like a good black oversized shirt
just to kind of lounge around the
apartment but also just to wear with
leggings for comfier days and cold rainy
days so I'm gonna leave a checklist for
fall closet staples down below in the
description box and aside from that I
hope you guys enjoyed it my fault closet
tour I love you guys coming back and
I'll see you guys all in my next video
bye guys
know what it does and may well be the
love there's a fear but I'm sorry the
way you talk to me there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
