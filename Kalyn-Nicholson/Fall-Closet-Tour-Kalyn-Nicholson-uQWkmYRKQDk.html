big favor and leave me a comment down
below which youtuber video has been your

curious to know since there's been so
many videos I don't think I've ever had
so many videos go out at one time so I'm
very curious as to which ones have been
your guys's favorite for today's video
I'm actually going to be doing a fall
closet tour with you guys and share with
you guys basically how I organize my
closet the layout of it and some of my
favorite things for the fall time right
now so if you guys want to see all of my
shoes my clothes my makeup and all of
that fun stuff then just keep watching
okay so in case you guys didn't see my
apartment tour I'll give you guys in
overview of the whole room first and
then I'll go into detail so first things
first on my closet door I have this over
the door hanger I think I got it from
Walmart on there are just my hats a
couple bags I have a laptop bag there
this white quilted bag is from Charlotte
Russe the tasseled bag is also from
Charlotte Russe I recently picked up
this Victoria's Secret bag it's like a
two and one you can put it as a backpack
and as a purse it was in my lookbook I
actually picked that up at the Vegas
Airport so it's from a Victoria Secret
outlet and then behind all of that are
just my robes so that is what I keep on
the door and then on the door handle
here I just like to keep extra workout
gear that I'm either using that week or
I'm going to wear again so next to my
door I just have my slippers right
beside my ottoman the grey slippers are
from Victoria's Secret and then the
other two are from a store called
Ardennes and then next to that is this
Ottoman that I got from home tsin I keep
extra blankets in there as well as
materials for DIYs and then just on top
of the Ottoman are some outfits that I
either have waiting to be filmed and my
travel makeup bag those two scarves
there are scarves that I'm waiting to
hang up for both blanket scarves that I
recently purchased the top one is from
garage the bottom one is from forever 21
and then I just have my leather jacket
just above there

in the buckets I just have to fake
plants and then in the first one here I
have a bunch of lipsticks from bite and
then beside that I just have all of my
melted lipsticks from Too Faced and then
another fake plant and then above that I
just have this canvas that I got from
JISC or JYSK or yes Gor however you want
to call it actually not totally in love
with this in this room to be honest with
you I think I'm going to switch it out
for something a little bit more black
and white but for now it's doing the job
and then above that I just have my glow
up letters that I got from when I went
to the Toronto Film Festival so then
right beside that I just have my IKEA
drawers and my desk on top of my makeup
drawers I just have all of my perfumes
to be honest I am someone that loses
perfume all the friggin time and now I
just usually buy like these little
travel bottles because if I lose them
that I'm not so upset to current
favorites right now our night by
Victoria's Secret and the Hollister
Cologne I'll spritz that on sometimes at
nighttime and then in front of my
perfumes I just have this choker that I
recently purchased from Lulu's and
behind all my perfumes I just have a
bucket full of eyeliners and eyebrow
pencils that I don't really use like
ever beside that or just a bunch of
lipsticks that I've collected throughout
the years to be honest all of this
makeup is from like when I was
collecting like two to three years ago I
want to use it all up and get rid of it
and I'm trying my best to be as
cruelty-free as possible because I know
that's a question that I get asked quite
often so I'll show you guys what's in
all of the drawers and the first one
here it's a bunch of lip products some
chopsticks and yeah just basically like
I said stuff that I've collected over
the years and then in the second drawer
we have all of my foundation I have like
fixed sprays and I have a bunch of the
Born This Way two-faced here I have more
like primers and stuff like that that's
pretty much it just like primers a few
concealers and foundation so for the
next drawer these here are just a bunch
of highlighters and then I have a bunch
of blushes and face powders mixture is
one of my favorites just because it's so
colorful and it's my bronzer drawer
these are all of the two-faced bronzers
and then I have some from NYX and then
just a bunch of like kind of no-name
ones through the years and then the next
Shore is all I stuff so I actually made
this tray that
everything is in I'll leave a link
somewhere on the screen here for this
video where I did a bunch of DIY makeup
organizers so the next row is just a
bunch of nail products and a makeup bag
like nail files things like that lotions
just random stuff like that like nail
keep and lotions and then this one here
is actually just a bunch of DIY crafts
this next one is just some extra pallets
that I have that I don't normally use
and then the very last drawer is again
just some more DIY stuff I have all my
sharpies in here and then I have some
like memorabilia like hotel cards from
trips that I've gone on with my friends
when I went to California in Vegas with
my best friend Monique we got a picture
with thunder down under' and then flight
tickets I have from like some of my
favorite trips so then beside that is
just my makeup desk inside the drawer
here is just mostly like palettes and
things like the Astra makeup brushes and
stuff for lashes and then on top of my
desk I have my bath and Bodyworks candle
a pumpkin this is more so my setup for
when I'm filming on these fake flowers
which are from home scents I have my
speaker that I use for getting ready and
then these two mirrors and then the
crisp morning air hand cream as well as
two of my favorite nail polishes right
now and then the lights that are strung
behind there are actually from Urban
Outfitters so if I can find a link I'll
leave it down below so beside my desk I
just have this bookshelf that I actually
got from Walmart and it has a bunch of
my shoes on it right now so this one
normally holds more like high-heeled
shoes or like fancier shoes I won't bore
you guys by listing off where all of
them are from but I will show you guys
some of my favorite one these ones here
are from Charlotte Russe I picked them
up recently and they're just so cute
starting to get a little bit too chilly
for them for the fall time but I'm still
obsessed with them so I actually got
these shoes from Nordstrom like a year
ago and they were sport a specific video
that didn't end up happening basically
just told myself that they're going to
be my wedding shoe because these are
like the most incredible things so then
on the top of my bookshelf right off to
the left here I have this bucket that I
got from Victoria's Secret and it
actually has just a bunch of computer
wires this little dog here he's actually
also from Victoria's Secret and then the
smaller bucket on the right holds a
bunch of hair elastics off to the side
is my closet sectional which again is
from Ikea if you guys didn't know that
already I will leave a link down below
if I can find it again I won't go into
full detail for absolutely everything in
here is from
I will give you guys like a full
explanation of how I organized it so in
the first section I basically have all
of my black robbers dresses seeds into
white which then leads into like tans
and Pink's and neutrals below that I
just put all of the shoes that are that
kind of fit like the neutral category
that are more booties than heels and
then on the very bottom I just have two
buckets the one on the left there is
actually full of more casual like
sweaters and tops and then the one on
the right is more crop tops and fancier
shirt so then beside that in the very
middle I just have all of my outerwear
and jackets and like plaid shirts for
tying around my waist things like that
and then below there I just keep all of
my sneakers my converse and then on the
very bottom I keep extra flats and shoes
issues I actually purchased off of ebay
they are the adidas nmd are ones and I
got them in like the taupe kind of color
I'll leave a link down below if I can
find them I'm pretty much obsessed with
them I think they are so cute my new
favorite casual sneaker and then in the
very last section here I basically have
all of my color clothes so that goes
anywhere from gray blue burgundy greens
and Red's I don't really stray too far
from that in the fall and winter and
then below there I just have all of my
black shoes and boots and like rain
boots a bucket on the left is full of
skirts whether they're maxi or cropped
skirts and then on the right is all of
my jeans and pants I recently picked
these boots up from Charlotte Russe
again they're probably one of my
favorite things that is in this closet
right now and then just above my closet
sectional I just have all of my bags
this black one on the end here I
actually used as a gym bag and as a
purse because of like the quilted
material on it I don't know I love it
it's from forever 21
it's so cute and it's probably a
favorite of mine and then lastly is the
closet over here's inside I keep most of
my like knitted sweaters and things like
that and they are also color-coordinated
then below that I just keep these three
drawers they have my bathing suits my
extra like more summery crop tops and
then shorts I won't go into detail for
anything in there because that's more of
like a spring or summer closet or but
again more ideas for the future and then
last but not least just beside the
closet there I like to keep my suitcase
and my carry-on bag for the season I
have
a blue one that I swap out for for the
spring and summer and then I use the
cheetah print one and the carry-on that
matches it for the winter and the fall
which then leads back to the mirrors
which then concludes our tour that was
it for my fall closet or I hope you guys
enjoyed it be sure to thumbs up if you
guys like this video or if you guys want
me to do a winter version in a few
months I think it'd be a fun idea to do
this every single season and share with
you guys like my favorite pieces that
are in my closet and stuff like that so
if you guys like that idea then just
thumbs this up and other than that I
will see you guys all in tomorrow's
video bye guys
