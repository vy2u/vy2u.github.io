youtuber I'm going to be doing some fall
DIYs with you guys so starting off I got
these little mason jars stuck to candle
holders from the dollar store you could
very easily just attach a mason jar to a
candle holder if you wanted to get the
exact same look and I'm just taking some
chalkboard labels and some faux flowers
from the dollar store as well and with
the chalk I'm just writing fall on all
four of them this was super easy and
really affordable and then I just put
all of the different flowers and
pumpkins and acorns and then took some
fake flowers and stuff them in the
bottom so you couldn't see the stems so
easy it's so cheap and just looked
really cute for the fall time with all
of the flowers in them
I'm also gonna be photo documenting
every day for the month of October on my
Twitter so be sure to follow me and then
next I'm just gonna show you guys how I
made this little reindeer canvas or deer
canvas this will be good for the winter
time too but I have an obsession with
tears they're probably one of my
favorite animals along with elephants so
I just went ahead and traced it to your
head you guys can look it up online I
just kind of looked up a clip art and
then just freehand it and then on a
black canvas I'm just painting it in
with white but you could do this on a
white canvas with red you could really
get fancy with this but I decided to do
the black and white so I could hang it
up and it would match my room so this
again was super easy to do and I got the
black campus from Michael's for those of
you that may be wondering and of course
what is for all without pumpkins so a
really easy way to decorate pumpkins if
you guys don't like to carve or if you
just don't want to use the knife is to
get these little tulip fabric
they're like little creams that you can
use or gels I don't know why I said
creams but you can use them on pumpkins
themselves so I just went ahead and took
the black and made swirls all over this
pumpkin but you could get super fancy
with this you could draw faces you could
make it really thick and then
spray-paint it and so yeah that again
was super easy to do and really
affordable and then next I made this
little leaf kind of like I didn't even
know it's just like a little decor piece
for above my bed so I got these two
sticks from the dollar store that were
covered in leaves and I'm actually gonna
take the leaves off to give it kind of a
like rustic chic stick look and I just
didn't want to go outside and pick
sticks off a tree so then I'm just gonna
use some string to attach the two sticks
together and I just thought this looked
better having kind of the twigs sticking
out on both ends so then just double
knot the string and then all I'm going
to do is take some of that actual twine
or string itself and hang different
lengths of string all the way across the
stick itself
then all you're gonna need is just some
fake leaves and I'm just going to take
the string and tie them off on every
stem of each leaf and I'm just
alternating different colors I'm not
really doing it in any pattern per se
I'm just making it as random as possible
and making sure that they kind of mesh
well together when you hang it and you
could hang this by string or I just hung
up some tacks and put it above my bed
and this is super easy and looks so good
for the Fall and then last but not least
I'm gonna share with you guys one of my
favorite treats so just pre-heat your
oven and I'll leave the exact recipe
down below but I'm just combining some
maple syrup and this is actually fake
maple syrup which is terrible but
whatever and it says for pumpkin puree
but I actually just like to use pumpkin
pie filling just to make it extra sweet
and bad for you and so I'm just taking
some Truvia instead of using sugar or
brown sugar this is pretty much just
stevia
and then just some oil and I'm using
about three tablespoons of olive oil and
then going in with just some bananas I
know these look gross but they were
frozen so I kind of had to microwave
them a little bit but just two bananas
instead of using egg then mix it all
together and add some baking powder some
sea salt some cinnamon some pumpkin pie
spice and if you don't have pumpkin pie
spice you can just use extra cinnamon
and then finally some baking soda and
then just whisk it all together before
adding about a cup of almond milk and
then I'm using a little bit of oat bran
and some whole wheat flour
so after mixing it all together and
making it so that there's no clumps
except for the oat bran I am just going
to add some vegan chocolate chips and I
like my pumpkin loaf super chocolaty but
if you don't like chocolate you could
add walnuts or cranberries you can get
really creative with it and then again
just mixing it all together before
pouring it into a bread pan and like I
said I like my chocolate so I sprinkled
a little bit more chocolate chips just
down the middle of the loaf and then I'm
just popping it in the oven for about an
hour and then once done just make sure
you guys let it cool down for about 10
to 15 minutes before you try and take it
out of the pan unfortunately I'm a
little bit impatient so I tried to take
mine out too soon and pretty much
butchered the entire thing so this is
what it looked like before it got ruined
and this is what it looked like after I
pretty much flattened it and ruined it
but it still tasted amazing so I hope
you guys enjoyed these really easy fall
DIYs and this little pumpkin loaf snack
and I'll see you guys all in my next
