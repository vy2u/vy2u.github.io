videos
struggle is so very Oh God
just starting to embrace the inner
pumpkin as wow that was the most
basically whoever said my life
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video it is the third day of
you Tober and we're doing up my fellow
Central's what you guys can't see right
now but I have them all laid out in
front me and it's festive AF also if you
guys haven't noticed the background has
been changing a little bit we've got my
good old black pumpkin serious black
that you guys help me name on Twitter a
few weeks ago which reminds me if you
guys aren't following me already
definitely be sure to check out my
Twitter and my Instagram which I'll pop
up on the screen so you guys can help me
name my other future baby pumpkins other
than that I have a lot to show you guys
in this video so without further ado
let's just jump right into all the
coziest of fall essentials so first
things first when it comes to fall
essentials I had to start with a lippy
saying the word lippy makes me feel kind
of uncomfortable I had to start with a
lip product yes come join us come on
let's go jump up good boy so this fall
one of my essentials for lip products
has to be my M cosmetics this is in the
color faded Clementine so it's just like
really nice it's literally the color of
my sweater and pretty much everything
else that you'll see in youtuber videos
I'll do a swatch for you guys since I'm
not wearing it now um but it's just like
this super nice like orangey
like I don't even know it's a matte
orange color and it's the most beautiful
lip product in the world not too much
and I have this like this weird thing
where I like the smell of her like lip
products this liquid lipstick has been
my freakin life and the other one that
I've been wearing which is on my lips
right now is called I think it's called
French nude but between those two colors
those have been my go-to this fall I've
embraced all the pumpkin within so I
highly recommend you guys picking this
up if you guys are looking for like an
orange lip color and if you guys aren't
feeling so bold then definitely check
out the French nude as well because it's
also a bomb color and next when it comes
to essentials for the fall is I have to
have a good fall playlist and for the
longest time I've been updating my crisp
leaves and lattes playlist which would
be guys follow me on Spotify you might
already know that but this year I just
wanted to start fresh I wanted something
new so I made a new one this year called
sweater weather and I'll link it down
below for you guys in the description
bar a sweater weather has definitely
been my go-to playlist for the last
little bit i've been really
that's it because it's a bit happier
than my crisp leaves and lattes playlist
I feel like in the past Falls I've been
a little bit more sad and this fall I'm
feeling very happy so we've got like you
know more upbeat songs yeah
like happy acoustic cozy like under 100
blankets of string lights in your room
vibes you know so having a fall playlist
is definitely essential and if you guys
decide to make any fall playlists tagged
me in them because I'd love to give them
a listen next which you guys don't even
know this yet Starbucks here my next
essential for the fall time is my
Starbucks order and no it is not an
essential and if you're gonna be making
coffee at home I highly recommend you
guys pick up the hazelnuts elk almond
four coffees it's like a coffee whitener
and this is like my at-home coffee
essential especially for the fall time
get the hazelnut one it is the most
amazing thing you'll ever put in your
coffee but if we're talking Starbucks
orders my essential for the fall time
has been a tweet to it's either I'm
feeling a little bit on the sugar-free
side so I go for the skinny cinnamon
Dolce latte made with coconut milk or
well like I got today when I feel like
treating myself this is gonna be the
most bond thing you guys have ever
tasted I swear go weigh in and get a
half vanilla half toffee nut latte so
they put half of the pumps of vanilla
half the pumps of toffee nut and then
get it with coconut milk this will
change your life it kind of tastes like
a toffee nut cupcake and it is
everything you need this falling more
and just honestly just like the best
thing ever if you guys are wondering I
ended up picking up a tumbler cup from
Starbucks because one to save the cups
and two just because I've wanted one for
a really long time and I honestly just
think that the size it goes with my vibe
you know that said if you guys have any
Starbucks drink recommendations for the
Fall popping them below unfortunately at
the pumpkin spice latte is still not
vegan I don't know why Starbucks hates
us so much but we're working on it she
keeps signing all them petitions you
know it's sad but I'm serious I actually
have signed many and of course we have
to do fall candles I I think I've come
to the conclusion guys of what my
favorite fall candle is and it has to be
autumn by Bath and Body Works I love all
of the fall candles this time of year
but there's
they know what autumn that I like the
most I think one it was the first one
that I actually ever bought from Bath &amp;amp;
Body where I remember vividly it was the
year I went away to college that I first
fell in love with fall because I was
away from you know my hometown and I was
starting to actually just really kind of
get to know myself as corny as that
sounds and I fell in love with fall that
year and my sister came down and we went
to Bath and Body Works and I remember
picking up my first ever candles and I
decided to go with autumn and leaves and
while I do like leaves it's a little bit
more on the cinnamony side the thing I
love about autumn is it smells like
morning in the fall time like it's just
got such a crisp but like a please smell
to it and it's just like the most
comforting oh it's just the most
comforting one I also really do enjoy
the pumpkin caramel swirl as well but
this one has to be my favorite or
sweater weather but this one maybe
sweater weather second that pumpkin
caramel as well I just like all of them
and of course the best part about fall
is fashion so when it comes to fashion
staples I feel like my three staples
this year has been booties jackets and
sweaters those are like my three go-to
I'm like I'm either going to base it off
of wearing really sick boots with it
wearing a really cute sweater or wearing
a jacket that just like pulls the whole
outfit together so I pulled my favorite
of each I mean if we're being realistic
this is probably my favorite sweater
this year and this is the one that I got
from shop oh it's like fuzzy and the
cutest warmest orange easiest sweater
ever but my second favorite is probably
this one here and no I'm not just self
promoting this I swear to god this is
actually gonna be sold on COEs but I am
obsessed with the fit of this sweater
it's a little shorter in the front and
longer in the back but this actually is
one of the most flattering black
sweaters that I have you can wear this
over skirts without it being too bulky
but you can also wear it with like
leggings if you're just having a lazy
day and then as for boots I picked up
this pair from Lola Shoetique you guys
may have already seen them on like my
Instagram and stuff I lost my pair of
brown boots and I love booties but
sometimes it's nice to wear something
without a bit of a heel so I decided to
pick these up and I've been wearing them
so much despite how hot it's been they
go just over your knee and they're super
open and like floppy at the top and then
the
it's sick because they like lace up all
the way from the bottom and then there's
like a big bow here so those are the
boots that I picked up from littlest
Shoetique and if they're still available
I'll link them down below but I'm not
wearing these so much and I feel like
I'm gonna get so much use out of them
for the next like at least two years and
then last but not least my favorite
jacket has been this one here I'll fall
coming up in my eat over schedule where
you guys will see a lot of the stuff
that I'm actually naming but this jacket
is from Shoko and it's like a cross
between a jacket in a cardigan it's a
bit thinner almost like bles material
which is nice because though it is fall
here in Canada it's been a little bit
warm so you can get away with wearing
things like this it actually is like a
trench coat and it goes super long and
hangs really loose and I got Greg to
unstitched the pockets so I can actually
stick my hands in them so this has been
my absolute favorite jacket I wonder if
you guys can take a wild guess I like
what my favorite color has been and of
course the second favorite to fashion
food when it comes to fall I think my
favorite food and the fall time has to
be pumpkin loam and again it's one of
those things that I have to make it home
because it's really hard to find vegan
but I have a really really good pumpkin
loaf recipe and leave the actual recipe
in the description bar down below I've
made it on camera with you guys before
and it is the most incredible thing
especially for like mornings with your
coffee oh my god it is like a life
changing experience I swear so
definitely check that out and if you
guys decide to make it let me know and
tell me if you guys liked it but pumpkin
loaf is probably like my favorite sweet
food essential and then ask for savory
food I would probably say butternut
squash soup soup in general is so good
but butternut squash soup is just like
it should just be like a whole section
of its own in the grocery store because
I would actually like sell it out and
again if you guys are looking for a good
vegan butternut squash recipe I'll pop
one know below next when it comes to
fall essentials
what would this video be without
slippers my old slippers guys they got a
hole in them and it was like the saddest
most upsetting thing in the world and I
was gonna go buy new ones but then I
ended up finding these in the back of my
closet and I actually kind of forgot I
had them which I feel like they're so
great for the fall and also you could
wear them right into Christmastime
got these last year that's said I think
I'm due to pick up a new pair of
slippers but these ones have been my
favorite recently I literally just took
them off my feet they're so cute and
just like furry on the inside and comfy
so I have to say slippers are definitely
an essential ball and then next of
course we had to do a favorite mug one
of my favorite mugs is this one here I
actually picked this up in the summer
from chapters in Canada if you guys go
on indigo you might be able to still
grab it it's just this orange mug that
says good morning pumpkin and then it
has a pumpkin around it which is the
most adorable thing ever when I'm not
using it I leave it up for display
because it's just so fall festive and
adorable
that said I'm currently waiting for my
new Coast fall mug to get here and it
says sweater weather and it has a little
mini pumpkin on the back I'm waiting
patiently for that which I feel like is
gonna be another fall fav of mine this
is something I'll drink out of like in
the middle of April just to summon fall
you know and of course what is fall
without some good established fall
reading material when it comes to my
favorite books for the fall time
definitely the Harry Potter series tops
the cake but I'm gonna have to say that
hush-hush is a very very close second if
not a tie these two series are not only
perfect to read in the fall time but
they are like I've never been so
addicted to two series before in my life
I read hush-hush last year and I'm not
kidding you it I got so sucked in and if
you guys remember actually went as mrs.
Patra Halloween last year that's how
obsessed I was with this series this
one's more of like a darker vibes I
guess you could say whereas we already
know that you're in Potter series is
like it's more magical whimsical things
like that but those are my two polish
central series but if you guys have any
recommendations definitely feel free to
leave it down below and if you guys
haven't seen it already I posted my fall
reading list earlier this week so I'll
pop that up on the screen if you guys
want to go watch it and last but not
least when it comes to fall activities
like my fave fall activity has to either
be apple picking or carving pumpkins
both of which are on my fall bucket list
this year
Apple thinking can be really fun because
you're eating the apples you can wear a
cute fa or like out of your house but
carving pumpkins is like you can put on
Halloween town in the background
carve funny faces into pumpkins and then
have them
played in your home so it's such a
toss-up between the two and I feel like
it has to be a tie so that is it for my
phone
obsession slash favorites les essentiels
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
gonna leave the list down below in the
description box and let me know your
answers to what all of my fault
essential questions are and I thought I
hope you guys have been enjoying you
