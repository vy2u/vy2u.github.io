for today's video we're going to be
talking about all things fall and then
you guys have been super antsy it for me
to be putting up some fall videos but
the only thing is if you guys don't know
this already I'm doing you Tober which
means that there's going to be a new
video every single day for the month of
October so if you haven't already be
sure to subscribe so you guys don't miss
out on that for that reason a lot of the
fall videos that I'm going to be doing
are going up in October but that said
this is one that I figured could go up
early it is all about you know like the
obsessions and the essentials and like
little things that I like to have for
fall and I figure if it goes out now
gives you guys time to kind of get your
own essentials altogether so that we you
know we can start fall early because I
started falling two weeks ago also if
you guys didn't know this we have
Bentley here with us today hey beanie is
one year's floppy to dude it's so cute
also if you guys aren't following me
already I'm going to leave up my Twitter
and my Instagram right here on the
screen so you guys can come check me out
so when it comes to my fall obsessions
slash essentials the first thing that I
always tend to do is make a fall
playlist so if you guys didn't know this
already I started one on Spotify it's
called crisp leaves and lattes I'll
leave a link to it down below or if I
can somewhere on the screen I started
this playlist back in August because
like I said I've been getting into the
fall mood forever ago my favorite kind
of music to listen to in the fall time
is more like indie folk acoustic live
songs I put a bunch of those songs
together some new ones and some of my
old favorites from other Falls into one
big giant playlist so go check that out
you guys have any like favorite fall
songs or favorite fall playlists let me
know down below but yeah my first
essential and like maybe even a tip for
you guys is to make yourself a fall
playlist because I don't know it just
I'll always wake up in the morning the
first thing I do is I hit play on my
crisp leaves and lattes playlist brew
myself coffee and light up one of my
candles I know that sounds so totally
basic but it is like the coziest way to
start your morning which speaking of
candles how can you talk about fall
without talking about candle so I'm
going to share with you guys my some of
my favorite fall scents in terms of
candles this year
you guys have been watching me since
last fall you'll know that I was
obsessed with the crisp morning air hand
cream and I was praying they would come
up with a candle for it and then bath &amp;amp;
Bodyworks did it smells nothing like the
hand cream I was in Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
the other day and I found the candle
called autumn day it is this it is the
exact same smell as the crisps morning
air so if you notice that the crisp
morning air doesn't smell like the hand
cream go pick up autumn day it's
probably my favorite candle right now
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's got a bit of
like a Napoli scent to it but yeah it's
very similar to autumn but autumns got a
little bit more like warmer notes to it
whereas this one's more crisp autumn is
also another favorite of mine which I
told you guys about I believe in my Q&amp;amp;A
and in terms of like a more like sweet
scent my favorite is the pumpkin spice
cupcake by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works has like
been a favorite of mine to burn at night
times like everything basic put into a
candle and then you burn it and then
your whole place just smells basic it's
awesome so on obsession of mine that
actually started this fall and you guys
won't have seen the pictures yet but you
will all season long I'm kind of
obsessed with making like a really cute
doorstep area now that sounds really
weird I'm going to do a cutaway clip
here so you guys can see but if you're
someone that's really into like clothes
and fashion and stuff like that I've
seen a lot of pictures like this on
tumblr and we hired it when out picked
up a really cute dorm at work for right
outside on my patio a nice little like
flower plant and then a lantern with a
nice fall candle inside and I just cozy
it up like my whole outside sitting area
as much as I like to hang out on my
patio in the summertime it's like my
favorite thing to do in the fall when it
starts to get a little bit more like
cozy you can put on a big sweater um
it's also really really key for taking
like overhead photos of like your boots
and whatever skirt or pants you're
wearing I love being outside especially
around this time of years so cozy up a
nice little area outside that you can
sit up side of the blanket in your
laptop or you know just like hang out
everything about this video is just
going to be ridiculously basic obsessed
with wearing booties all year long but
fall is by far the best time I feel like
to wear them and I'm going to show you
two of my favorites which I actually
picked up recently all this one
already gotta sting I picked up these 2
pairs of booties from urban planning if
you guys live in Canada you're going to
be like what those are from urban
planning yeah they are heel isn't as
chunky as it normally is on booties and
I find that I've just been really
obsessed with that lately I can find
something similar online I'll leave a
link to it down below as well as a nice
black bootie so these are by far my
favorite things they've like the perfect
balance of kind of like dark and grungy
and also just cute and chic so I have a
whole video coming about this in you
tober hint hint but another thing that I
really like to do with a fall time is
get into a kind of like fall esque book
so the book that I'm actually reading
this fall yes my sister's going to freak
out when she sees this is Harry Potter I
never actually officially read Harry
Potter and my sister has always been at
me for it so we started this book club
where we give each other books to read
so she's reading hush-hush which i think
is really good for the fall time and she
told me to read Harry Potter which is
she said is really good for the fall
time I have a whole list of really
awesome books to read this fall that's
going to be going up I believe it's on
the 3rd of October but I could be wrong
guys want to read the same book as me
then pick up Harry Potter because this
is gonna be the book I'm reading and I
should I get such a good essential to
have like a good book that kind of puts
you in like the darker fall mood you
know and getting into the more fashion
and beauty essential one thing I'm super
loving for the fall time is like the
kind of lid a grey purple and like moles
of this fall time so the nail polish I'm
actually wearing right now on my nails
is by Sally Hansen it's in Street flare
and it is their miracle gel now I
wouldn't tell you guys to go ahead and
spend the extra money on the miracle gel
because honestly I didn't see a huge
difference that they did have a color
super similar to this in just the normal
Sally Hansen but I'm absolutely obsessed
with this nail color for the whole time
I think it's so cute and obviously then
like whites and grays because I always
wear white and gray on my nails it's
just like I go to and as for lips um if
you guys were wondering what lip color
I'm wearing in this video it's actually
a fall essential of mine I have been
absolutely addicted to bite like the
lipsticks buy buy it they are cruelty
free and they are all-natural
ingredients so you
actually eat it the great off of your
lips if you hold it to my to go to
essentials for the fall time is the one
that's on my lips right now is called
cashew and it's just like the perfect
like taupe kind of color for the fall
time that of course for a dark lip
because I love love love dark lips in
the fall time I'm obsessed with whisky
bye bye perfect balance between kind of
like a darker brown and a Burgundy's and
I like that they called it whiskey
personally I actually really do like to
drink whiskey so maybe that's why I
dunno Emma last and final essential for
the fall time is to have like a super
comfy cozy sweater so I have to to show
you guys this one I already talked to
you guys about it was in my recent fall
haul I got from forever 21 the material
on this is so soft and it's just this
massive like cape t-shirt it is so comfy
it is so cozy and it's such a good go-to
for the fall time I'm really into the
kind of like thinner material sweaters
and this one scoops at the bottom it's
kind of in like a purple burgundy and
this one is actually from a TN a heavy
sweaters are a little bit too much for
me this one's not that bad because it's
actually still pretty thin so it's warm
but this kind is definitely like my
favorite in terms of like not sweating
like crazy buckets and then control like
a scarf or like a cardigan over top of
it or whatever and I just think they're
super casual and so comfy and my voice
just broke right there and if I can find
links to those I will leave them down
below so that is it for all of my fault
must-have essential subsections whatever
we're going to call this let me know
down below what is an absolute must-have
or obsession for you guys this fall
because I'm always looking to add to the
list of things that I obsess over and I
hope you guys are pumper you Tober I'm
so excited I've been working my frickin
butt off on these videos I have to get
31 videos done so I started so long ago
and just watching each and every video
go up it's so I get so excited but it's
also kind of like sad because I'm like
they're not gonna see this for like
another month but anyway yeah I'm super
excited about it I'm so pumped and I
feel like you guys are gonna absolutely
love the videos this year there's so
many good ones
