enough hauls in the last little bit I am
breaking out September with my first
fall haul so have you guys been watching
my videos for a while you'll know that I
have a slight obsession with fall it's
my favorite season I go I go crazy I
just fall everything all the time and I
yeah I just I get really excited about
it I love the fashion I love the candles
I have all obsessions so I am going to
start off early September with an early
fall haul and just show you guys some of
the stuff that I have recently gotten in
terms of just some upcoming videos and
just for fall in general so I'm not
going to try to under anything and I'm
really sorry because I know you guys
always ask me for a try on haul you guys
always want me to try on all the stuff
that I then I show you guys because I
don't want to try it on and just like
ruin the surprise of the video you know
I want I don't want you guys to know
what the opens are gonna look like when
they come all together I just want it to
be a surprise as dorky as that sounds
okay so one thing that I did pick up and
it's you know perfect for like this
September month because I find even
where I live up in Canada September has
its hot days and it also has its cold
days so for the days where it's a little
warmer I picked up a romper and I just
grabbed this black one here I love it
because it's got like an underlining
obviously but the whole it's completely
covered in like lacy crochets so it's
super adorable and it's just got
spaghetti straps and then the
underlining cuts off a little bit
earlier than the crochet does which is
like one of my favorite recent detailing
that I've been seeing on a lot of things
and it's got this scalloped bottom so
next I picked up these pair of pants
here and I hate jeans
I hate jeans like I want to start a
petition about how much I just don't
like wearing normal jeans so I always
buy like stretchy jeans or jeggings
because I like to cheat the system and I
picked up this pair here they're black
so it's gonna be nice to look like I'm
wearing got jeans but it actually feels
like leggings like these are super super
stretchy
so the
the pair I got I just love the zippers
on the bottom it's such a cute cute
little detail I have an obsession with
hats too so I know I say obsession a lot
but I seriously do have an obsession
with hats so this is what the hat looks
like here and it's just got the cutest
little pom-pom on it and it kind of fits
like like a beanie where it's kind of
seguir in the back and I just think this
is gonna be so cute for both fall and
winter even though it's a little it's a
little early for winter I won't throw a
winner in your face yeah I'll be wearing
this hat a lot
I can't tell in the viewfinder if this
looks ok right now so I'm sorry if it
doesn't but I'm probably gonna be
wearing this hat a lot this fall and I
just think it's such a cute little hat
and the next thing I picked up was this
sweater so it's just a nice like it's
almost like a burnt burgundy color but
yeah so this is the sweater that I
picked up it's in like a darker burgundy
or burnt burgundy it's not I don't know
it's gotta have some like black like
stitching weaved through it so it makes
it a little bit darker but the best part
about it is the back of it it's
completely open back and it's got like a
twist if you guys can see that I still
be really cute but just got a nice
strappy bralette
in the back and like I said I have a
specific outfit for the sweater in mind
but it's super just like casual and
comfy and I am a sucker for just casual
sweater
oh mylanta so I've picked out this coat
and this this jacket is probably gonna
be my most worn item in my closet for
the next 5 years um so I picked out a
new leather coat because I have a
leather coat but it's really old and I
don't like the material that it has on
like the cuffs and the bottom so I was
like perfect opportunity to get a new
leather coat because I had like a
perfect fall outfit with this coat in
mind and oh my gosh I can't explain to
you guys I made sure it was vegan
leather it even has a thing that says
the fitted vegan leather blazer but yeah
so this is what it looks like
can we just talk about this coat for a
second I am in love I love leather coats
and this one is just it's pure
perfection just pure pure perfection I
wish it wasn't a million degrees out
right now because I would just go walk
around town in my new leather coat like
look at how cute this is this is just
such uh I just I just love leather coats
like I didn't even know how to describe
this leather coat because I just don't
think you can put perfection into words
like that this is like it's like kind of
like a blazer style which I like it's a
little bit more fitted but yeah so this
is the coat that I got and I'm super
excited about it so the next I picked up
this fitted crops tank top from
Nordstrom it's just in like a it's this
one's more of like a purpley burgundy if
that makes any sense but yeah it's just
a fitted cropped top it kind of has like
a vintage look to it and I have the
outfit in mind for this one too but it
just it's really cute and it's just a
good staple to have in your closet like
these style tops they're probably one of
my biggest staples and as even for the
fall just with a cute skirt and some
knee-high socks or whatever in a
cardigan it's just that's like my go-to
outfit and the falls so I picked this
out thinking it was a lot smaller than
it really is but regardless of its size
I am in love so look at this just like
if if all of perfection came into one
bag or one purse it would be this bag
slash this purse because it's got black
white and brown which means no matter
what your outfit style is like no matter
if I'm wearing black shoes or if I'm
wearing brown shoes or if I'm wearing
taupe shoes or from wearing white shoes
I can always wear this bag and it's just
it's so versatile and I always have the
struggle of whether I'm wearing black
shoes or brown shoes what bag to wear so
this is gonna be my new bag this whole
fall like this is gonna be my go-to I
think might go to pers usually my go-to
purses a small little satchel but this
is gonna be my go-to big purse so yeah
and it has just it has just a bazillion
pockets like you can lift this up and
use the front section or
or you can open it up and use the inside
and it comes with a shoulder strap which
is always good because I always end up
using the shoulder strap so I also
picked up some shoes and I have two
pairs to show you guys so the first pair
is this one here and I have a lot of
booties if you guys know me you'll know
I'm obsessed with booties but I don't
have any that are dark right so these
are the pair of booties that I picked up
and they kind of have like this faux
suede material and yeah they're just
like a dark grey just cute little like
wedged well that's a good safe pickup a
cute little wedge bootie but the blech
it's only probably about two to three
inches high so it's not it's not too
tall or anything and yeah so that's what
they look like they lace up in the front
and these are just gonna be really easy
and versatile for leave fall in winter
as well and it just doesn't hurt to have
a good black skater skirt in your closet
it's just a good staple to have you can
wear it with pretty much any color any
color high socks and color top and kind
of cardigan you just you can go crazy
with it so if you guys don't remember
from last fall if you guys have been
following me for that long and a lot of
my blog posts and fashion videos from
last fall I was always wearing like
skirts skirts skirts skirts and dresses
but mostly skirts so this is probably
gonna be worn a lot I finally got a pair
of rubber boots and I haven't wanted to
get a pair of rubber boots for so long I
just think they're so cute and they're
so nice for the Fall and for the spring
but especially for the Fall and yeah so
I picked up a pair of just black
standard hunter boots and I just hit
myself in the head with them and I just
I have so many cute outfits of mine for
these rubber boots but I'm just yeah I'm
really excited about them so these are
the new little pair of rubber boots that
I picked up and then not only did I do
that but I also got the insert socks and
these are like the greige like the gray
beige cable-knit ones so yeah
though you'd look funny on the bottom
but you slip them in and you just fold
this part over so that it ends up
looking like that so those are the
rubber boots that I ended up
picking up from North Shum and again if
you've been following me since last fall
as you guys know my favorite season to
shop for candles is the fall times I
went and made a trip to Bath and Body
Works on more than one occasion so this
wasn't not all picked up at one time
this is definitely over the last
unfortunately like two weeks so it's
really could have just been at one time
but it wasn't so I'm just going to show
you guys the stuff that I got from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works it's all fall stuff sooo
excited so first I stocked up on the
holy grail mahogany teak wood because I
don't get much more basic than my
mahogany teak wood candles so I had to
stock up because this is gonna sound
terrible but I only have three left so I
needed to stock up with a fourth because
you can just never have too many
mahogany teak wood candles you know and
then the next one that I got was autumn
and I haven't picked I didn't pick a
bottom last year or the year before I
don't think so I haven't had autumn in
my candle collection since I was in
college and the one that I didn't have
in college it wasn't done so I've always
wanted to pick up autumn but for some
reason I always pick other ones on top
of it so I was like no I'm picking up
autumn this time so yeah I like autumn
because it also has a little bit of like
an apple II smell underneath it so yeah
it makes me really want to go out and
picking but that is the other candidate
extra candle what that is the other
candle picked up I do have more candles
to show you guys but to make myself feel
a little bit better about it I'm going
to show you guys the other stuff I have
to show you before the candles so last
year I found this hand cream it's gone
because I finished it off last year but
I found this hand cream called crisp
morning air bow the body works if you
ever for some reason watch this video
please make a candle with this scent but
yeah so this is the soap and the hand
cream that I picked up I found the hand
cream again so I was like I have to get
it because I used this hand cream pretty
much every day last fall and it kind of
smells like autumn but a little bit
different it does have a bit of a Napoli
to it but it's very I don't know it just
smells exactly sorry guys I like to
crack my knuckles it smells exactly what
I picture like the morning smelling like
in the fall time and it is called crisp
morning air so they nailed it on that
scent and I picked up the soap version
I've been of it too because now that I'm
a grown-up I have my own bathroom so I
want to share with my roommate but she
doesn't complain about me picking up all
these soaps so I had to pick up a soap
because that's the grown-up thing to do
when you have an apartment so now my
hands can smell extra crisp so that is
the soap that I picked up I also picked
up by another hand cream at a different
time that was like the second time I had
to cut the body words have a problem but
I also picked up another scent hand
cream and this one's cozy vanilla dream
and it's just okay it's hard to smell
with the Chris morning air beside of it
it just smells like a vanilla latte and
I like I like warm sense at night so
next I have been burning some of these
already before I film this fall so if
you're wondering why the wicks are black
that's why but the next two candles I
have to show you guys I picked up the
newest style of sweater weather because
my sweater weather candle from last year
has about this this much left so I love
the smell of sweater weather because it
kind of has a Cologne he sent to it so I
love Cologne ease type smell so this
one's really really rich when you burn
it it's very like I would burn it in an
open area because this one it smells
very strong and then the other one I
picked up is pumpkin pie because pumpkin
pie is my favorite pie and I didn't even
know they had a pumpkin pie candle so I
kind of freaked out a little bit when I
saw it but pretty much I could tell you
what it smells like but I'm sure you can
guess that it smells like pumpkin pie
and yeah it's just it smells like
pumpkin and cinnamon it's just really
really good so that is the other candle
that I picked up and last but not least
I only have two more to show you because
as if I don't already have enough
candles I need to show you guys more so
the other one that I picked up is leaves
and I actually still have the leaves
from three years ago now it's three
years old because I got it when I was in
college and for some reason
was one of my favorites that year so I
burned it till there was about this much
less and I can't bring myself to burn
the rest as weird as that sounds but
it's very nostalgic for me because it
was like right around when I first
became like madly in love with fall like
always been in love with fall but I just
I went crazy that year is the first year
I went crazy so I haven't brought myself
to burn it and this is the first time
I've ever brought it again so I now have
a new leaves that I can burn big person
from a burning candles on a I pretty
much burn a candle every single night so
I went to a back and body person picked
one up because I forgot to bring one up
there with me so when I was in Toronto I
picked up vanilla pumpkin marshmallow
and it smells just like it just smells
like coziness and a candle because it
smells like a mixture of vanilla and
pumpkin which was obvious because it's
called vanilla pumpkin marshmallow so I
mean that was a pretty pretty obvious
thing for me to tell you guys but it
just it smells really really good and I
love I like I go back and forth between
like warm scents like this where's that
kind of warm and cozy and more rich
sense like leaves or sweater weather so
yeah that is the vanilla pumpkin
marshmallow and you can just never have
enough pumpkin candles because I'm just
so basic sometimes that it hurts and so
I bye pumpkin everything but I've been
obsessed with pumpkin before pumpkin was
like a basic thing to do I've always
just really liked pumpkin pumpkin pie
was my favorite pie when I was like six
okay so I must have just been a basic
kid then so that is my first phone call
because we all know that there's
probably gonna be more so be sure to let
me know down below which thing from this
hole was your favorite and just know
that there are so many fall videos
coming now I'm getting super cozy I'm
getting like super I don't know I'm just
I'm finally starting to finish off like
the apartment or like just my upstairs
just my bedroom and my office I'm
finally finished doing it so now I'm
starting to get into like kind of fall
decorating and stuff so there's gonna be
a lot of fall videos coming a lot of
like decorations and DIYs and fashion
videos and just so much to come so I
hope you guys enjoyed this haul and
than that I will see you guys all in a
future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
