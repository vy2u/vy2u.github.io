stop to say spare my mum's house let's
cut the window after ready hey everyone
and welcome back to my channel for
today's you Tomer video I'm going to be
doing a follow up book with you guys
this one book is going to be a little
bit different than what my look books
normally look like I usually like to go
out and film the outfits in a bunch of
different settings and so I noticed that
some people were saying that there
wasn't enough like you know attention on
outfit plus with the added bonus I it
takes me forever to film those styles of
look books because I always have to find
new places to go and to get somebody to
film and all that stuff I figured I
would try filming a lookbook right from
home that way I could get the whole
video done in like two to three days and
get it up for you guys so let me know
down below if you guys like this style
of lookbook I can still go back and
forth between both also be sure to
follow my Twitter my Instagram I will
put it right here on the screen I'm
always posting photos of outfits all the
time so definitely come check that I
don't know than that if you guys want to
see some fall outfit ideas then just
keep watching you know you'll get AI
lookin for trouble you sir she served me
right rig up every morning make every
night first time
we go in every site yeah you like it
down there start and on the guide but
you take me make every night first time
get to the Cooper now wiggle it
attention
not a shot but if they saw how we burn
they call the cops but I never wonder if
he won't be here wolf a lot cuz every
night is bad every night

I hate you
keep doing your way out again just don't
you have stuff don't you
