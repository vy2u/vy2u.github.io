over books and I couldn't be happier hey
guys for today's video I wanted to share
with you guys five different books to
read for the fall time it's always a
high request of mine to get back into
doing more book related videos and I
actually love doing them I just don't
know why I I know kind of through phases
in and out where I read and then I kind
of stopped reading for a little bit and
then I get into really big reading modes
again today I have four books that I've
already read that I'd highly recommend
reading during the fall time and one
that's on my reading list so if you guys
aren't already I'm going to leave my
Instagram and my Twitter right on the
screen so you guys can come follow me
I'm always kind of posting especially to
Twitter about like books that I'm
reading and stuff like that I do like of
currently reading and if you're new to
my channel hi hey what's going on dirty
subscribe and come join our family and
have book talks and yeah okay so without
further ado let's jump in usually when I
go to pick a book to read in the fall
time the kind of vibes I usually go for
I know kind of like dark and twisty
because it is full time and you know
there's like Thanksgiving coming and
Halloween coming and it starts to get
chillier and the leaves start to change
color and I don't know why I just kind
of go for something a little bit more
deep and dark so on that note the first
book that I'm going to recommended that
you guys read this fall is the
unbecoming of Mara Dyer this is the
first book in a trilogy and this
probably tops the list of top ten books
I think I've ever read I'll give you a
quick read off the back to give you guys
a better idea of what the books about it
says you wake up with no memory of the
last few days your friends were killed
in an accident that you miraculously
survived your family has to move to
another state with scape the fallout you
made a mysterious boy who seems to know
more about your past than you do you
start seeing things that can't possibly
be there you're afraid you're losing
your mind can you keep it together Mara
Dyer is about to find out I highly
recommend this series it's a lot of
stuff that happens inside your head and
it's kind of dark and there's lots of
Secrets and it's a bit scary very
suspenseful book actually the whole
trilogy is but it is so good and the guy
in this book his name is Noah
this is what I picture No
like from the book just can't go wrong
so the next book that I'm going to
recommend you guys read is called
uninvited by Sophie Jordan now I read
this last year this is book one out of
two books okay
I'm recommending that you read uninvited
cuz it's the first book right and it's
really good don't get me wrong but I
read this solely so you can read the
second book because the second book
unleashed it's like it is like nothing
I've ever read before no storyline has
ever captivated and then changed my mind
ever like ever I'm talking you feel one
complete way reading the first book and
then in the second book you're like what
the heck is she doing and then all of
the sudden you just completely uh I
can't describe it out of all the books I
have ever read in my life
Unleashed which is the second one and
this one too but Unleashed is probably
the top three books I've ever read in my
life
I was so obsessed with the storyline you
guys have to read it I can't describe to
you what this author did to my brain I
can't describe to you what she did in my
life one time Peggy and I we were
walking to go a froyo one time and we
got so deep into a talk about this book
that we were like like our arms we're
going we were just like freaking out
talking about the things that we're
going on in this book that we forgot we
were in public like that's how good this
storyline is I haven't even told you
guys what this book's about when Davy
test positive for homicidal tendencies
syndrome aka the kill gene she loses
everything she doesn't feel any
different with genes don't lie
one day Davy will kill somebody
uninvited from her prep school Davy is
thrown into a special class she couldn't
be more different from her fellow
classmates especially Sean but with no
one else to turn to Sean might be the
only person she can trust maybe he's not
as dangerous as he seems
or maybe Davy is just as deadly there's
just no words I just read it just do it
third on my list of book recommendations
this fall is hash hash by Becca
Fitzpatrick I actually read this back in
January I actually just finished reading
the second one of this which is
crescendo about two weeks ago patch
which is the boy in this book I picture
patch the same as I picture Enzo from
Vampire Diaries like insert example
right here just look at them just look
at them that's how I picture patch being
in this book it is so good again it's
another kind of darker storyline
it's about fallen angels I'll read you a
little bit off the back it says when
Nora patch our force together as lab
partner Dora would rather fall to her
death and put up with his elusive
answers to her questions
his teasing and his infuriatingly
handsome and hypnotizing eyes it seems
patch was put on earth just to drive her
crazy but before long Nora's defenses
start to break down as her curiosity of
a patch heats up why does he always seem
to be wherever she is and knowing
exactly what she's thinking how does he
know what to say to both attract and
repulse her what is up with those
v-shaped scars on his chiseled back as
their connection grow stronger Nora's
life becomes increasingly fragile Nora
needs to decide is patch the one who
wants to do her harm or the one who will
keep her safe again it's another one
that I highly highly recommend and yeah
it's really good and then a fourth and
the final book on my book of
recommendations that I've already read
it is match this is a really really
really good book it's definitely
dystopian it's not as dark as I would
say is the other ones but it is
definitely more about like a very
controlled and manipulated society I
read you guys what the book is about
from the inside it says cassia has
always trusted to the Society's choices
when her best friend appears on the
matching screen cassia is certain that
he is the one till she sees another face
flash for just an instant before the
screen fades black now she is faced with
impossible choices between Xander and
Kai between perfection and passion but
it's basically about this world we're
like in society the officials decide who
you love where you work when you die how
many kids you have
and it's about that kind of society and
then the last book that I'm going to
talk about in this video is one that I
actually haven't read yet but this is on
my reading list for the fall so this
one's called
even when you lie to me by Jessica
Alcott read you guys the inside of what
it is about Charlie is looking forward
to senior year of high school another
year leaving in the shadow of her best
friend Lila another year of hiding
behind the covers of her favorite novels
another year of navigating her tense
relationship with her perfectionist mom
but everything changes when she meets
her new English teacher mr. Drummond is
smart
irreverent funny hot everyone loves him
she also thinks that she might not be
the only one with a crush so yes it is
like the typical Aria and mr. Fitz
storyline where this girl falls in love
with her English teacher but yeah I
don't know I felt like it was something
that was a bit different this one's
definitely not as dark but it's about
like
now going school and all that so I
figured it was it makes sense for the
fall time okay I'm just finishing up
bliss by Shane Mitchell so right after
I'm done reading that book this is going
to be the book that I pick up next so
that is it for my book recommendations
for the fall time this year if you
decide to give any of these books a read
let me know down below also if you guys
have a reading list or any book
recommendations for the fall time again
comment those down below because I'm
always looking for new books to read
other than that I will see all of you
guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
