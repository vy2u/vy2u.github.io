hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm doing a get ready
with me a fall video because it is
officially September which is honestly
probably the most exciting news I've had
all year I actually have an event this
week so I wanted to practice this makeup
for that night hence this video and also
I just feel like why not you know kick
off September with just like a fall look
it just felt so right you guys aren't
following me already be sure to check
out to my Twitter and my Instagram I've
already been posting a ton of ball looks
and my Instagram feed has already like I
made it so that what September hit you
know we were already just we were we
were knee-deep in the fall and also
subscribe if you guys aren't part of the
coast crew fan hey youtubers coming up
and daily videos plus October equals a
lot of fun but other than that if you
guys want to see a start-to-finish get
ready with me for this look then just
keep watching so I'm gonna start with
the urban decay illusion complexion
primer also quick note about my lashes
you guys will see it in Sunday's vlog
but I went and got them filled the other
night and when I went to sleep I rubbed
the crap out of this eye so now I
literally have one eye of false lashes
and one eye without so I think I'm
calling it quits with false lashes I
just don't think I'm cut up to them so
I'm gonna be wearing false lashes in
this video eventually but in case you're
wondering why I look like a cyclops
if so I'm gonna stick with my normal
foundation I really need to actually
restock on this but it's the Urban Decay
all nighter waterproof long-wearing
liquid foundation this is so bum
especially if you're doing like a full
face makeup or you're going to like
events and stuff this stuff is perfect
it never falls off your face so you can
bet that when you put this stuff on
especially for like events or nighttime
looks is not going anywhere
so in terms of what palette I'm using
I'm going to use I've used this before
and I get ready with me but be it naked
heat palette
this palette is literally everything you
will need this fall every single color
is so fall related it's amazing I'm
gonna start slow and then build it up as
I go so I'm gonna start with sauce and
low blow in my crease and then I'm going
to continue to build up with darker
colors but I will put overlays of which
colors I'm using as you see me
so I'm gonna set because I totally
forgot to before my concealer I'm gonna
be using I'm going back to my good old
trusty Kat Von D shade and light palette
as you can see I've used so much of this
already but it's so good so I'm going
just with the lightest one just because
I didn't do a super light concealer I'm
gonna go with the lightest one touch of
the yellow one as well
just kind of mix the two and look really
scary down but I swear this will get
better I'm just gonna add the lightest
coat of mascara to my lashes to blend
them because I am gonna put falsies on
even though my eyelashes are a hot mess
right now but you know I'm working with
what I have and then ask for lashes I'm
using a pair of the velour fluff and
thick they're super dramatic but it's a
really dramatic fall look so I wanted
them to be as dramatic as possible this
takes like a heavy amount of
concentration so I'm gonna put my Harry
Potter audio book back on and apply my
now I'm going to contour my face I'm
again going to be using these shade and
light palette
my captive only if you guys do ever you
know feel the need to splurge on
something I highly suggest this be it it
is like the most incredible contouring
palette I'm gonna start with the
lightest color and then I'm gonna go in
just on the edges with the darker colors
eyes all I have to say is I'm just so
freakin happy that it's officially
acceptable to go like crazy I mean it's
always acceptable to go crazy on your
makeup but I just really like in the
fall you can do grunt your makeup and
then to top it off I am going to skip
blush and just go for a highlight so I'm
using the I mean it comes as no surprise
I'm using the now's the time it's in the
urban decay a Basquiat palette and I'm
also going to take a little bit and
highlight the inner corner of the eyes
to just kind of make them pop a little
bit literally talking like I have any
idea what I'm saying
so for lips I'm going in with the M
cosmetics this has been that my holy
grail nine times out of ten it's been
this over the last month this one is in
the color French nude and I just feel
like since the eyes are so dramatic I
kind of wanted to keep the lips a little
bit more natural that's anything about
my face right now is natural is done kid
do my hair it's still super wet from the
shower gonna have to start my blow
drying it and then I'm just going to go
ahead and curl my hair
I haven't curled my hair actually since
I've gotten it done so I'm deciding to
use this video as an excuse I'm gonna be
using my Bellamy and curling one this is
just in the biggest barrel they have and
I'm just gonna curl all of my head I
don't part any layers or anything I just
start from the back work my weight from
the front on both sides I'm not being
sponsored this was just literally my
favorite curling iron and the only one
I've used probably for like three years
now so all I did for the braids was take
a small chunk just under like the top
layer of my hair and I braided it and
then pulled on it just to make it a
little bit more loose and voluminous
hold it all the way over to the other
side and bobby pinned it under the top
layer of that hair then I use the rest
of it and tied it into a bit more hair
on this side and then did the exact same
thing by braiding it flipping it over
and then teasing it a bit so that it was
a bit more voluminous and crossing it
back over and Bobby pinning it as well
under the same layer so just kind of
creates this like braided headband where
you have two braids kind of crossing
over but I like that it's just towards
the top and then the most of your hair
covers it and then ask for my fall
outfit I am just wearing a pair of
leggings my Victoria's Secret I am
pairing it with a cropped sweater that I
got from Soho this is going to be
probably one of my most worn sweaters
this fall it is in this like burnt
orange color and it's the softest thing
you will ever freakin wear it's in one
of my future youtuber videos but because
I know you guys are gonna see that for a
little while I figured I would show it
to you guys now if you guys want to see
more dramatic looks like this with a
fall time just thumbs up I was thinking
about doing a tutorial on how to wear
like black lipstick since it's actually
one of my favorite looks for the fall
time so if you guys want to see that
definitely let me know and also if you
guys decide to recreate this makeup or
hair or outfit or anything like that be
sure to tag me in it so I can see and
yeah aside from that I love you guys to
the moon back I hope you guys are
getting excited for youtuber I have so
many videos in the bank right now it's
so freaking exciting hence why
everything is already like you know we
should name her the little vampire anime
like what should her name be help me
name her yeah and other than that I will
see you guys all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
