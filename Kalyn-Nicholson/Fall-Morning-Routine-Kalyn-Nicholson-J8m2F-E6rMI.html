Hey guys, what's up and welcome back to my channel!
For today's video, it is officially Day 1 of Youtober
which is literally the most exciting news
I've had all freaking year.
We've finally made it. The official countdown is complete,
Youtober  can now commence.
If you guys don't remember or know what Youtober is,
Youtober is a daily video series that I'm gonna be doing on my channel.
So from today until Halloween,
there's going to be a new video every single day.
If you haven't already, make sure to subscribe, or hit the notification bell
so that you guys know whenever the new videos go up.
And as for today's video,
I decided to start off Youtober with a morning routine
because 1) it is the most highest requested, like, video I get for Youtober,
is to do a Fall morning and night routine.
(hint hint to a future video)
And 2) I thought it would just be like a fun way to kick  off of fall activities that are going to be going on,
over the next 31 days.
If you haven't already, be sure you check out
my twitter, my instagram
if you guys wanna stay in this world of like Fall and October.
And aside from that, instead of boring you guys any longer,
let's jump right into my fall morning routine.
