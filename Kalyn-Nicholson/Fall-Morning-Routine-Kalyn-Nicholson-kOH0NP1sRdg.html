think about me hey guys and welcome back
to my channel today it's the 18th day of
you tobert I hope you guys have been
enjoying all the videos so far today's
video I'm going to be sharing with you
guys the ever highly anticipated fall
morning routine it's been a recent goal
of mine to start incorporating some like
healthier habits into my day-to-day
living and there are a few things that
actually worked their way into my
morning routine instead of just sharing
with you guys my one of your teen I'm
also going to share with you guys of
five hacks for the morning time to make
sure you have a really productive day
and you know that you're in a really
really good mood my first half for the
morning time is to open up a window or
try and get outside this is something
that I've recently started to do I like
to sleep with all of my windows open in
the fall time because the air outside is
just so crisp and cool but it's also got
such a calming effect on me first thing
in the morning to either have like fresh
air coming through the window or to be
stepping outside and just kind of like
being a little bit cold and crisp and
you just throw in a big sweater and
drink your coffee inside it'll do
wonders for your mood the second morning
hack that I've been incorporating into
my daily routine is to stretch so I try
to do this first thing upon waking not
only does it wake up your body but it's
also just like a super peaceful thing to
do before you know you just jump out of
bed is to just kind of sit there with
your eyes half-closed when you're still
like pretty much dead to the world and
stretch out until like you know you're
feeling a little bit more awake and a
little bit more badly my third hack is
to prepare the night before and now I
don't go to work or school on a day to
day basis but if you do I would
recommend you know making your lunch um
something I do like to do at nighttime
though is so my outfit for the following
day just makes it so much easier and
also makes my morning a lot less
stressful so the fourth hack that I have
for you guys for the morning time is to
get yourself into a positive mindset so
whether this is going for a walk maybe
you like to work out in the morning do
something in your morning routine that's
kind of just for you that triggers like
a positive mindset that will last the
whole day for me this is kind of like
vibing out on the computer I like to go
on like tumblr
we heart it and listen to my crisp
leaves and lattes playlists it's just
like starting the day off with like that
kind of music and you know starving the
web and just kind of like chilling out
by myself or even just like 45 minutes
it honestly puts me in such a positive
mindset I'll always look up like cool
quotes in the morning time I'll look up
like photo inspiration and things like
that that make me really inspired and
also just feel super positive for the
rest of the day my last and final hack
is such an obvious one and everybody
always says it but it's to eat breakfast
honestly it'll change your entire day
you'll have so much more energy you'll
just hopefully you in a better mood in
the morning you should have gonna be
starving you know an hour two hours
after you leave the house so those were
my five morning hacks if you guys want
to see my morning routine then just keep
watching
I'm ready to run
to put robber on the road to feel the
wind on the moon they always see where
the Sun set go

the car before me until it leads me home
