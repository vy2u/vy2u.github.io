even holidays well
script what's up guys and happy Friday
the 13th for today's video I'm going to
be doing up my fall night routine which
is super exciting I've been teasing
doing this video since the very
beginning since I started on a morning
routine and why I wanted this to kind of
be the halfway point through each over
which is kind of crazy that we're almost
halfway through you tober i thought it
would be more fun and festive to upload
it instead on Friday the 13th
really quick if you guys aren't
following me already be sure to check
out my Twitter and my Instagram I've
been posting almost every day as well on
to especially my Instagram so definitely
come check me out on there as well as on
Twitter I've been teasing what's going
to be coming at the rest of youtubers so
definitely come check that out and aside
from that I guess I won't bore you by
continuously talking I hope you're all
watching you know creepy movies tonight
and popping up some popcorn after
watching this video which if you guys
want to see my fun light routine then
just keep watching
so usually my night routine begins
around 6:00 p.m. when I finish doing
work now I work from home so obviously
it's literally a matter of just you know
shutting my laptop and putting it away
and to kind of signify that I'm done
doing work for the day I always take out
Bentley right away because it's like I
start my day by taking a Bentley and I
end my day by taking a Bentley so I just
take him for a longer walk usually
longer than I do in the morning time and
yeah we just cruise around and then take
the stairs back up because we're trying
to be healthy
there's a woman saw it in paper in an
office south of here
the dreams of a life
the wind blows through her now this is
gonna sound weird but I swear to you
guys I'm never in my apartment without
putting slippers on so I leave them at
the front door and always switch back
into them and then I like to feed
Bentley right away because he is a
little hungry monkey all the friggin
time
so I feed Bentley and then I light up
some candles and then I decide to cook
my own dinner so lately I've been super
obsessed with just making a butternut
squash soup and then putting a bunch of
fillings in it my fridge is broken right
now so I couldn't put veggies but I
filled it with rice and just cook that
up and then while that's cooking I like
to answer emails and just got a little
bit more work done on my computer the
dreamers living just one day
take away all the sadness sound the pain
well that woman sada made
she looks sound to the show and while I
know it's kind of a terrible habit I
tend to sit on the couch and watch TV
when I eat dinner but I live alone so I
feel like it's a little bit more
justified I don't know I've been
watching Nashville friends and scream
queens so those would like my three top
shows lately
and I'll usually just watch an episode
while I eat dinner and then once my
dinners done I just carry out the rest
of the episode maybe on my phone or you
know just paying attention either
to the man
noble promise ESB and once my dinners
done I like to take a quick thirty
minutes just to clean up little random
things around my apartment it just kind
of helps me keep on top of keeping
things clean
so I'll wipe down counters I'll clean up
the dishes from making dinner
I'll put any shoes away just organize
anywhere that needs to be cleaned
sometimes I'll do laundry so basically I
just take 30 minutes to 45 minutes to
just do a big clean sweep well can't you
see that all our dreams
it's a one big explosion yeah and once
that's done I'll usually light up some
candles plug in all my string lights
switch into comfy clothes and then start
to go through my like nighttime or
evening beauty routines so that usually
requires me taking off my makeup
slashing my face putting on a face mask
and all of that you know girly stuff
it's one big explosion in the sky
walk it all the dreamers
just one day take away all the sadness
sound of me
and then I also like to put just like a
leave-in conditioner in my hair and put
it up anywhere into a braid or like a
clip or ponytail river and a boat
because his home is right this constant
motion and as odd as it is I keep like
different things in different bathrooms
so then I usually head to the other
bathroom and brush my teeth
for the river of life life upon agree
so then usually by this time I have
about an hour to an hour and a half
before I'll usually go to bed so I'll
pull up my laptop and either get some
extra editing done or just kind of like
chill out and you know answer emails do
whatever I have to do basically on my
computer if there's extra work to be
done or not and then once that's done
I'll plug it back in in its spot wash
off is a face mask and moisturize and
then basically prep the house to go to
sleep that sounds weird but like you
know unplug all the lights do all the
things somehow get the feeling
I'll become
and all
I'll be tired
driving auntie
thousand dollars party man
Valen - ha
but it's sealed with every step I made
wasn't rope that our words balloting
one of you and then just before bad I
like to challenge myself to read one
chapter a night so I'll try and squeeze
in my chapter or other times I'll
actually spend like another hour reading
and then the last thing I like to do
before going to bed is just check out my
day planner for tomorrow basically prep
anything I need to get any clothes out
if I'm working now in the morning things
like that and then fill out my journal
if I'm feeling it that night and then
head to bed
that is it for today's video I hope you
guys enjoy it if you've been enjoying
all of the you Tober videos so far big
thumbs up I honestly am like
flabbergasted by the fact that two days
from now will officially be halfway
through October
I'm a little sad but I'm also a little
excited because Greg and I booked our
Mexico trip last night and I think I'm
slowly inching closer to what I want to
be probably now I'm gonna go you know
like I said watching scary movies and
pop up some popcorn and possibly even
make it for intense so happy Friday the
13th and I will see all of you guys in
tomorrow's video bye guys
