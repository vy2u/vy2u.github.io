finish my editing for the day I'm
usually editing later on in the day so
that's usually where the night begins
and I'll head downstairs and usually
just refill my time-lapse water bottle I
got this off of actually Blogilates
website and I kind of follow it during
the day to make sure I'm getting enough
water so I just refill it and put it in
the fridge so that it's ready for the
next day and then I will grab myself
some dinner or make dinner with my
roommate we usually blare music and cook
but for today I was just reheated some
soup for dinner
yeah and then while I eat dinner I'll
usually just kind of surf my social
media or post a picture for the day or
just talk to Meg's or whatever it is I
end up doing but yeah I usually do that
while I'm eating dinner and then
something I've been trying to do lately
is just get my dishes out of the way
right away so I just quickly rinse them
and we don't have a dishwasher so we
have to use the spongy thing but I will
clean my dishes right away so I don't
have to worry about doing them the next
day after that I usually head right
upstairs and a plug in my room lights so
that I can turn off like the overhead
light and such and I don't know I just
like to make my room cozy and just throw
my phone on the charger and change into
my pajamas before heading back
downstairs
usually this is about the time Maggie
and I hang out and do really weird stuff
on like snapchat and such so she wasn't
home when I was filming this but follow
us on snapchat if you guys want to see
how weird we get and then after that we
hang out for about a couple hours I head
back upstairs and I will usually go on
my computer and this is when I find I'm
kind of at my best for thinking of like
videos and planning out my week so I'll
usually kind of just surf the internet
and have a little bit of fun and also
just go on my agenda and plan out my
week or check what I have to do the
following day or come up with fun video
ideas for the following month and just
stuff like that that all usually happens
around this time
and then of course this is where all the
fun happens not actually I usually head
into the washroom and wash my hands put
my hair up so I can that wash my face
and things get pretty real and scary
when I wash my face especially when I
have a lot of mascara eyeliner on but
yes so I usually have to wash my face
like twice to get everything off and
then brush my teeth and basically all of
the boring stuff that's in a night
routine
and something I've recently been in love
with is peppermint tea it so this is
about the time I'll usually make a tea
and I've been either drinking peppermint
or the immunity which is good for your
immune system but yeah so I just made
myself a cup of peppermint tea
and my roommate usually stays up later
than me so I'll salute her before
heading up to bed and once I do get back
upstairs into my room this is usually
when I do like my me time so I'll pull
up my breakfast tray to drink my tea and
then throw on some TV usually Grey's
Anatomy or how i met your mother lately
those have been like my two favorite go
to shows for the night time or I will
just kind of hang out on my phone I'll
light some candles or I'll read or go in
my journal just whatever I feel like
doing at this point it's usually
different every night that's what I
usually end up going with so yeah
and if I am watching TV I always make
sure to set my alarms first so that I
don't fall asleep and I like to get up
early so I need to make sure that I set
my alarms ahead of time and then of
course just some Netflix and chill by
myself and for those of you wondering
I've been reading Twilight again lately
and I'm just I'm so in love with it all
over again so then I'll usually blow up
my candles and unplug my room lights and
start to get ready for climbing into bed
and going to sleep so that is it for my
recent fall nighttime routine I hope you
guys enjoyed let me know what fall
videos you guys want to see down below
and I will see you guys all in the next
youtuber video bye guys so blush in the
things you
haven't you heard up curious mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
