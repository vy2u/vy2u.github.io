February favourites and I'm actually
filming this a day early so it's
February 27th not the 28th which is the
last day if I write and that is due to
the fact that tomorrow is actually my
birthday so I knew I wasn't gonna be
able to film this tomorrow because I was
gonna be preoccupied with my birthday so
I'm filming it a day early so that I can
get it uploaded by tomorrow hopefully
I'll upload it probably tonight /
tomorrow and by the time you guys are
seeing this it's probably my birthday or
probably way after my birthday into
March who even knows but happy birthday
future me tomorrow so um I'm going to be
doing my February favorites today I
don't think I've done a favorites in a
really long time so I'm excited to do
them because I'm sure a lot of this is
different or stuff that I haven't really
talked about yet so my favorite
foundation for February has probably
been this Annabelle skin - natural
lightweight makeup foundation and I got
this actually I think in the summertime
I purchased this and I never really went
never really grabbed for it for some
reason I think it's because I was using
my covergirl lightweight foundation at
the time but as soon as I moved home in
December I started going tanning again
and I know that a lot of people don't
agree with tanning and tanning beds but
I have a couple of skin irritations and
not skin like how do i how can I wear
this three different skin conditions and
going tanning actually clears them up
for me so that's why I have so much
color in the winter time it's
considering I live in Canada though this
foundation has been amazing it's super
super lightweight and it's just got like
it gives you nice coverage it's covers
up my rosacea and whatnot but it's still
it still feels lightweight it doesn't
look cakey at all so I've been wearing
this a lot and I'm in the color Sun
beige if you were wondering um the next
thing is something you guys have seen in
my tutorials I believe and it's the it's
the pressed powder by covergirl clean
and it's oil controlled pressed powder
and this one here I have I purchased a
while ago I've completely hit pan sorry
this area like my t-zone and it kind of
highlights that area of my face for
I've been really loving the bonnibel
glimmer bronze which you guys would have
seen in my makeup Hall my drugstore
makeup all recently
so you open it my eye is twitching that
is so weird
and it's just kind of like you have to
shake it and it gets the powder up and I
kind of use this all over my face I'm
not gonna lie and it gives me a really
nice glow and I think it was only like
three or four dollars into my favorite
blush has been the Fox in a box by hard
candy and um it has like the four colors
on the inside the light pink like a
corally pink a medium pink and like a
bronzed color and I just kind of take my
blush brush and kind of hit all four
colors and tap off the excess and just
kind of go at it I'm actually wearing it
right now and it gives a really nice
natural glow without it looking too like
shock you pink so I've been loving
loving loving this blush and again this
is from like Walmart and I think it's
only like three four dollars um again
this is from Walmart super super cheap
it's the New York City so the NYC
individualise in smoky blues created for
blue eyes but anyone could use it so
it's got like this
champagne II kind of color here a nice
topi like I don't have a satin kind of
color I don't even know what I would
call that um a nice Bron like dark brown
with some gold bronze shimmer and some a
darker purple but it has like a warm
it's like a warm dark purple so it looks
really really good on blue eyes and then
it also comes with two eye primers like
a color fixer and like a primer but I
don't really use those but you totally
could I've use them before they're
really good they just make your eye
shadow show up more but you don't even
need them because the shadows themselves
are so pigmented especially for a
drugstore palette it is crazy how
pigmented those eyeshadows are and I've
been wearing these in a lot of my read
so my favorite singular eyeshadow is
from it is the Maybelline Color tattoo
in the color I think it's barely branded
yep barely branded so it's just this
like champagne tea color and it's a
cream eyeshadow so it goes on very very
well I like to use it as an eyeshadow
base as well as because it is very very
close to the hi shape the hi shadow
what the eyeshadow highlight that I do
in my inner corner and up my brow bone
is because it'll totally work as an eye
primer too and it comes in a couple
different colors so you can really go
all out with the color tattoos for sure
so my favorite lipstick for this month
has been kind of a funny story I went to
go purchase a benefit lipstick lipstick
and I picked out this really pretty
Corley color got home and opened it and
it was not the same lipstick at all I
was so upset it was not the coral one
that I'd purchased and it wasn't even
the same like design but then I ended up
actually throwing it on the other day
and I realized how much I loved this
color I have a lot of red lipsticks but
I mean this one so I can't even explain
it son has probably complimented my skin
tone more than any of my other red
lipsticks and it's in the color flirt
alert by benefit so I've been with I'm
actually wearing it right now and it's a
really awesome color it is or lip chaps
whatever you want to call it I couldn't
pick one so I picked two they're my baby
lips um I have almost all the baby lips
I love them so much but my favorite ones
have definitely been these two now this
one's pink punch and this one is peach
kiss so pink punch is this color here
it's just like a nice baby pink and it
adds like they're really really
moisturizing for your lips but they also
add a little bit of color so I wore this
in my get ready for me for Valentine's
Day and you can see that my lips go a
little pink it wasn't like lipstick or
anything but that's why I liked it and
this one here is like a nice I don't
know it's like an I would say it's more
of a nude than a peach but it's hard for
you guys to see but this one I like too
because I like to wear this when I'm
wearing more of like a natural face
because I find it really complements
like the natural color of my lips it's
really close to the same color favorite
mascara has been my Maybelline falsies
volume Express in flared I used to use
the other one I forget what it was is
just that blue around you I'm not sure
but this one has been my ultimate
favorite the only downfall with these
mascaras I would say the Maybelline
falsies is that I find they run out so
quickly like I can only use them for
like two weeks and I have to purchase
any one whereas my
mascaras tend to last a little bit
longer than that but maybe it's just
because I wear it so much that's why but
this has definitely been my favorite
mascara or eye crayon I don't even know
what this is is just a favorite for the
month I've been wearing this a lot -
it's my NYX jumbo eye pencil and cottage
cheese and it's just a nice white I'm
actually wearing it right now on the
inner corners of my eyes and I'd like to
use this if I don't if I'm not using my
champagne kind of colored one I'll pop
this in the middle and the very inner
corners of my eyes and it really makes
my eyes pop and seem a lot bigger so
I've been wearing that a lot too and I
like the smell of boys and boys my
cologne and so if I can't just go around
smelling a bunch of boys all the time
because that would be really weird why
not just make myself smell really good
like I can pamper myself I can cuddle
myself so I just like to spray myself
Cologne so I have like Hollister cologne
Abercrombie Cologne and I love them and
I wear them all the time but then I
realized that that's probably not the
most attractive thing around guys like
guys were like oh like hi nice to meet
you wow you smell like a boy that is
really weird so I realized that I do not
have to start wearing perfume a little
more - so I started to wear my Taylor
Swift wonderstruck and I've just been in
love with it it's my go-to when I'm
gonna wear perfume so and I like it cuz
it's it smells super nice but it's not
like overpowering to the sense that
where it's gonna burn anyone's nose when
you're walking by just like a light airy
feel and I find it a lot of people it
could work for a lot of people so my
favorite nail polishes again I couldn't
just pick one I had to pick two they're
the two that I probably were the most
this month and maybe even for January it
is my ACO which is just means our Deen I
don't know if you guys will have a
Nardin or know what our Deen is but it's
just an our Deen nail polish and then my
China Glaze nail polish so this one I'm
actually wearing around my nails right
now it's this color right here and let
me see if there's a name for it yep it's
called sea wave and you guys can
probably already tell that it's my
favorite color
next to coral because everything in my
room is basically this color so I've
loved this nail polish and the other
nail polish I've been loving is my China
Glaze
and flip flop fantasy I've been getting
really really excited for spring and
summer because I'm so done with this
whole
the pressing winter thing so I've been
wearing a lot of bright colors lately
and this has been one of them I'm not
wearing it right now but I believe I was
wearing this in my mascara routine video
and it's just like highlighter shocked
me pink and every time I'm wearing it on
my nails and I'm doing anything like I
work I'm whatever and my nails are super
super super bright and it just makes me
so happy and so excited for like spring
and summer and I'm sure I'll be wearing
this a lot in the spring and summer too
so my favorite drink and again you guys
will probably not agree well some of you
might not agree with this one it has
been the Monster Energy absolute zero I
love this drink it is amazing especially
when I'm just feeling really groggy in
the morning and I know that I don't want
to get up I don't want to work out I
don't want to even face a day I just
want to lay in bed all day I'll crack
one of these open and instantly I feel
so much better and it's taste so good
you would be shopping you know a lot of
people don't really like the taste of
energy drinks and I know a lot of people
are gonna be like they're so bad for you
and I know they're bad for me but I
don't get a lot of iron because of my
diet being vegan so I tend to be really
groggy and really tired all the time so
these really do help me and I literally
drank at least one every other day this
month they are a lifesaver to me and I
love the taste of them so then come
January I decided to go vegan for my own
personal reasons and basically what
vegan is is it's not only do you not eat
meat you don't eat the animal
by-products either so therefore you
don't you don't drink milk you don't eat
cheese you don't eat eggs you don't eat
any of that stuff now I can make a video
kind of talking about that if you guys
want me to elaborate and again that
might not be for everybody but that was
my own personal choice
and that is what I'm really passionate
about so but with going vegan feel thing
I learned very very quickly it's the
amount of things you can snack on are
very very minimal so I have been like
devouring organic peanut butter like
it's my day job so yes organic peanut
butter is vegan there is no butter
anything in it and basically what it's
made out of is peanuts and oil
I believe normal peanut butter can be
vegan too but I love organic peanut
butter it's one of those things where
the first few times you eat
Organic peanut butter your like you this
is gross because it's definitely not as
sweet as normal peanut butter but then
once you kind of continue to eat it and
then you kind of try and eat normal
peanut butter again you're like that is
disgusting that tastes so processed and
this tastes so real so I don't know I
absolutely love organic peanut butter
I'm not gonna lie I go through a tub of
these like a week literally a week I'm
not even over exaggerating I eat like
two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a
day because I really can't eat much else
other than like fruits and veggies and
if I'm not eating like PB&amp;amp;J I'm eating
PB on Apple's PB on strawberries peanut
butter on bananas peanut butter on
sodium crackers which has been my
absolute favorite like from Pretty
Little Liars on last night I was a
mountain down on sodium crackers and
organic peanut butter like crazy and you
know what I even just eat peanut butter
on peanut butter I take a spoon and I
just go I'd go to town on this peanut
butter like I can eat peanut butter like
peanut butter is absolutely the best
creation that has ever been made over
anything on earth favorite phone case
for February has been my TNA which I got
from Orencia and it's just kind of like
this highlighter tribal print I've been
loving loving loving loving tribal print
lately so this has been my favorite
phone case iPhone background and asks
for my favorite songs for the month I
will choose one fast song and one slow
song so I guess I don't really even have
a choice with this one because it
instantly became such a favorite of mine
but um I don't know if you guys like
country I'm a little bit of a country
fan so my absolute favorite slow song
for this month would be fall into me by
Brantley Gilbert if you guys don't know
who that is
check that song out it is the most
adorable amazing song ever written and
I'm secretly in love with Brantley
Gilbert and asked her
my favorite faster song for the month I
wouldn't say there's one that actually
stands out for me but if I had to choose
one it would probably be
I knew your trouble by Taylor Swift I
listened to that one a lot especially
when like working out and stuff
summaries basically like my favorite
month because it is my birthday and I am
turning 19 tomorrow whoo
which means um if a few live in Canada
that would mean that you're illegal to
drink now so tomorrow should be a fun
day for me but um anywhere else I'm not
sure with illegal drinking ages although
I know in America it's 21 so 19 means
not that exciting for people in America
but it's exciting for me and other than
that I guess I just we'll see you all in
my next video yep bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
