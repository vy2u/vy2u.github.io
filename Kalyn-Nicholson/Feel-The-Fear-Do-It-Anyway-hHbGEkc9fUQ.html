so as you guys know I'm turning it back
into a routine trying to get up at 6:45
every friggin morning guru I'm up
I just made up myself a coffee I'm
drinking out of my New York mug again
because I leave tomorrow morning at like
I have to be out of my apartment by like
4:30 in the morning to get to the
airport ethnically I've given myself my
own like work schedule from Monday to
Saturday and then Sunday's are like my
day off but it's more like a chill day
to like edit and stuff like that so
normally on Sunday mornings I wake up
and watch cartoons I guess if I'm gonna
be honest with you guys I don't know
it's just this is gonna be a big big
trip for me in terms of getting out of
my comfort zone I so I just wanted to
feel a little bit like routine today so
I'm watching the Spongebob just gonna
drink my coffee and which spongebob I've
got a bunch of stuff to do today to get
ready for New York okay so I have my
list of to do's to get done for the day
so let's start
you just
my eyes
I can
pouring rain upside right now I'm so
tempted to go there
it's raining out okay so I actually just
finished packing I haven't packed away
absolutely everything yet because I'm
going to finish packing tonight the
things that I obviously still need to
use throughout the day like my laptop
and son if I went packing my suitcase if
I know that like I'm gonna be there for
four days then I plan out what outfit I
think I'll wear those four days and then
I'll give myself one bonus outfit case I
don't want to wear one of the ones that
I planned out then I make sure to pack
two outfits to work out in not even just
for working out but if one of those days
I feel like going a little bit more
casual then I packed pyjamas and then my
outfit for the plane I'm going to be
wearing my sneakers on the plane and
then that way the only shoes I had to
pack were a pair of booties I basically
made it so I could mix and match
depending on my mood while I'm there
aside from that I packed up the
notebooks for dreamcatcher and then my
own personal notebooks for like video
ideas I had to pack away my makeup
tomorrow after I wake up and get ready
and then just like my hair supplies so
like I just mentioned to you guys um I
actually have been feeling a little bit
not anxious but definitely nervous all
day for this trip when I plan to do
things I get really excited about them
and then the moment that it comes to
actually follow through and do these
things I would definitely say a little
bit of anxiety kicks in any time I'm
leaving my comfort zone I start to get
very nervous there's this quote that I
like to live by that says filled feel
the fear and do it anyway it's actually
why I got my fearless tattoo pulled away
from the situation a bit and thought of
it from a bigger picture and then the
bigger picture guys like there are a
million things that I want to do on this
earth there's a million things I want to
do before I die and I can't have
somebody holding my hand through all of
those things from my entire life I need
to learn to stand on my own two feet and
that includes even just you know going
on trips and traveling sometimes I know
I relied too much on bringing people
with me or the comfort of having someone
there with me so I don't feel like an
idiot or I don't you know cower away
from situations where I feel like I
don't know anybody or things like that
and even in terms of relationships this
is like the first time in my life that
I've really felt fully content just
being single and on my own so this will
also be the first time of me ever
traveling alone without having like a
boyfriend at home to talk to or message
or like call me every night and I put my
tripod down because my arms are hurting
from this life chat rapping push
yourself out of your comfort zone that
is where
you'll grow the most that is where you
know you're going to start finding out
more about yourself you're going to grow
as a person you're going to become
stronger and more independent and
anytime you feel anxious or scared or
nervous about those types of things just
think of it from a bigger picture of
what you're going to learn from this and
anytime we've ever done anything that
you were afraid of afterwards how
amazing is that feeling and that's a
feeling I'm going to get from this and
that's the feeling you'll get from
pushing yourself outside of your comfort
zone it's thundering outside this is
whether it could literally not be
anywhere perfect sorry if this vlog is
super boring or just like all over the
place it's just that's where my
headspace is out today and yeah so I'm
now going to order myself some Thai food
for dinner because I didn't get any
groceries this week knowing I was
leaving as well as paint my nails
they are super chipped and they need to
be redone don't you come a bit closer to
my side just for a little
all right so I am currently on my
computer downloading a bunch of music I
have about an hour left to finish
packing my bag edit this video upload it
and schedule it and then hit the hay so
that I can get at least 5 to 6 hours of
sleep before I have to be able to get
ready nope that's it thank you again so
much for your help my New York trip just
got cancelled I've been awake since 4
a.m. now going on 7 o'clock in the
morning woke up my dad at 4 a.m. what a
champ he drives me to the airport and my
flights cancelled so I had to come home
I had to call the company that I booked
my trip with and then I've been on the
phone with them since 5:00 a.m.
basically without sounding too cheesy I
feel like the universe is trying to tell
me that it wasn't meant to be New York
didn't happen for whatever reason it
didn't happen I'm gonna go take a nap
when I go wash my face and then climb
back into bed for like an hour - yo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
