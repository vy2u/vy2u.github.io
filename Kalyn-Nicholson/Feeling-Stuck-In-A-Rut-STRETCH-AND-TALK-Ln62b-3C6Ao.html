channel for today's video I'm going to
be doing a new twist on a coffee table
cut out a request that I do a stretch
and talk with you guys and I thought
that was such a cool idea so I decided
it to turn today's coffee talk into a
stretch and talk where we're literally
gonna do yoga well I'm gonna do yoga and
we're gonna talk about life halfway
through I'm gonna make a smoothie and
then we're gonna sit down and finish off
the chats just so weird just like
standing in the middle of my room and
also this doors really bothering me okay
much better so for today's video this is
the first time I'm ever filming one of
these so this might be a trial and error
thing before we perfect the stretch and
talks by it welcome to the first
everyone in existance guys we're making
you know Joe's crew history right now we
also have a very cozy Bentley joining us
today bundled up in the heated blanket
really quick of you guys aren't already
I'm gonna pop my Twitter Instagram on my
blog right up here on the screen come
and check it out blog posts go live
every single Friday I'm opposed to a lot
more to my Twitter my Instagram than
usual so definitely come check that out
and aside from that today's stretchin
talk is gonna be all about how to get
out of a rut especially now that we're
kind of in that awkward stage of winter
where it feels like it's kind of gone on
a little bit too long it's easy to fall
into a rut I find this time of year so
if you guys want to stretch and talk
about how to get out of rat then just
keep watching ok so first things first I
need to like set up my yoga station in
my room I ended up pushing my bed over
and it means so much more room to do
yoga which has been amazing because I
was getting a little claustrophobic so
all I do to like yoga find my room is I
just get rid of this little fur rug it
just like pop it in my closet
then I keep my yoga mat just back here
usually light up a candle or some
incense polo to plant or to you know
just really get things should we get
things cozy and Zen so consider in
today's video is all about how to get
out of a rut I feel like it all begins
with the fact that it's like I said the
middle of winter and it's that awkward
time of year where things just feel like
it's so dragged out and we're all kind
of getting ready for warmer weather and
flowers and spring and even admitting
that I can hear the snowfall coming to
completely Blizzard on my parade I
boiled it down to five main questions
that you need to ask yourself in order
to pull yourself out of a rut first
question is where are how in your life
do you feel stuck or do you feel in a
rut and ever I feel like I'm stuck or
very emotionally like harbored in some
way like I can't get past something or
something's really weighing me down or I
just feel so unmotivated and just icky
and gross and like I just don't want to
do anything this is where meditation
comes in huge because it wasn't until I
really started to take meditation more
seriously that I was able to kind of
catch myself before ruts really kind of
took the full form taking that time to
just get quiet with your feelings and to
think about all aspects of your life and
then kind of think about nothing at all
it makes it easy for emotions and for
thoughts and for ideas to float through
you and to come to your attention things
that might be contributing and
controlling your life more than you know
but you don't even recognize it or
you're not even conscious of it because
you're too busy like running around that
you don't have time to really sit and
ask yourself what is causing me to be
feeling the way that I feel is it work
is it school is it you know health and
fitness is it your own
self-consciousness is it social is it
where you thought your life would be at
this age no matter what it is you have
to ask yourself what parts of your life
feel stuck and then follow that up with
just like on a day-to-day basis what
don't you like about your current
situation is it your routines is it your
habit what is it about your day-to-day
regimen right now that you don't enjoy
try and keep a note handy on your phone
on a piece of paper to be able to write
down what it is that's coming forward
for you what your answers to those
questions are because then you'll be
able to dictate what's emotion and what
is feeling you can't just be
there's a reason why you're angry you
almost have to strip away the emotions
you feel towards everything and instead
look at the root feeling feelings are
things that we can change feelings are
things we can work with and mold a
little bit whereas emotions are more the
surface level expression of our feelings
for asking our feelings our deep floppy
little feelings to come up and boil over
and tell us like what is it that's
making me feel like I'm stuck or what is
it that's making me feel like I'm just
not sparked or infused with Joey to wake
up in the morning that I just feel like
I could have been Akane no one's muscles
for loosening you know the second
question when it comes to pulling
yourself out of a rut is asking yourself
why and this is where the details of the
day-to-day fall way short to a deeper
meaning as to why we feel and why we act
the way we act this is something that
poets and scientists doctors everyone
it's a question that we've all asked
long before you or I ever existed and
it's why do we ask the way that we act
feel like the reason why we can't find
an answer to it is because it's a
different answer for every single person
when a boils down to eight your life is
made up of choices and decisions that
you have made based on what you have
experienced and like I feel like I'm
being a little preachy here but again
just pulling that back to the meditation
when we're not conscious of those things
when we're not conscious of maybe the
beliefs or attachments that we've
created in ourselves and created with
our life then we can find it really hard
to change the things that to our core we
really truly want but on an unconscious
level our wants and our actions aren't
aligning what are our beliefs about life
what are the things that we've attached
you or the ideas that we've attached to
how do you feel about yourself what are
the beliefs that you have within
yourself about who you are or what your
life is supposed to look like it's also
through this kind of self-evaluation
that without being harsh on yourself
it's also a good time to kind of ask
okay if you're unhappy with where you're
at right now what was the role that you
played and getting to exactly where you
are and I know that this is a question
that can kind of like ruffle people's
feathers a little bit and I know that
when people have highlighted that to me
when I've been in a bad situation I'm
kind of like how dare you like what do
you mean of course I wouldn't have put
myself here if I had a choice and life
there's been choices I've made and
there's been repercussions because of
those choices and I didn't even realize
I was making those choices at the time
it boils back to my belief system and my
attachments and how even though it's not
necessarily what I wanted i attracted
things to me based on my level of
consciousness based on how I viewed
things and based on my perspective about
the outside world and my perspective
about myself I feel like every year up
until last year I was so desperate to
find this positive life and while I
chased it
and chased it and I tried doing
everything I possibly could to gain that
kind of lifestyle that I thought you
know I was missing the whole time it was
actually just an eternal shift that I
needed to switch it was to stop
believing that there was something
lacking from my life or lacking from who
I was to create a more positive life or
a more positive outlook on life if I
would have just looked more positively
at myself and if I would have just been
more grateful for the things that I did
have and more grateful for the life that
I was living rather than chasing a life
that I thought I should be living then I
could have been living a more positive
lifestyle all along we all play a role
whether we accept it or not and where
we're at the fact that I'm sitting on a
yoga mat and we're doing a stretch and
talk it is a direct result from I
started getting into yoga this year and
then someone commented that comment on
the video about doing a stretch and talk
and now because of those things the
alignment came through that this action
is now happening and it created all of
the actions that follow after this video
and so it's important to know like there
is no set destination there's always
going to be more action and more
decisions to create along the way but
you have to ask yourself like what
beliefs and what attachments are you
carrying with you along the way because
every action follows another which
follows another and if you're walking
through all of these actions unaware of
the fact that you think about things
very negatively unaware of the fact that
you doubt yourself before you even give
yourself a chance then it's going to be
impossible to align your wants which are
to be happy to be positive to a love
your life and enjoy your life with what
you're actually getting from the world
I'm getting from yourself because you
are saying you want something but then
all of your actions and all of your
beliefs and all of the things that you
back it up with tell a whole different
story
gotta be an angel for you wrote on this
paper oh my oh my god I'm feeling now
the fire is alive hiding deep inside all
this the third question that you have to
ask is what do you have control over I
did a whole blog post on this so I will
link it down below but it was basically
just the things that we do have control
over versus the things that we don't
there are certain things in our life
that we will never have control over we
had no control over who we were what our
name was you know who our parents were
where we're from what our upbringing was
but what we do have control over is
where we take it from this moment it
doesn't matter if there's been so many
times before in the past that you've
tried and you failed it doesn't matter
if this is like your 50th time trying to
pull yourself out of a rut it doesn't
matter if you've tried to accept who you
are before and it didn't work it all
boils down to finding a way to be at
peace with the things that we don't have
control over so that we can stop
focusing on them we can then turn and
have so much more space and time and
just like energy to give to things that
we do have control over
I remember for the longest time when I
first wanted to become a youtuber I
envied the people that lived in
California I hated Canada I didn't want
to be Canadian I was like almost ashamed
and thought that I would have been so
much cooler had I lived in California
and it's just so funny because that was
something that I couldn't change and it
was something that I used to let bother
me so much instead of just kind of
living my own life and finding the
enjoyment of the place that I did live
at that time if I one day wanted to move
to California that I could plan for that
and I can get excited for that but I
shouldn't have let it take away the
happiness that I was having in that
moment because in all reality now that
I'm older I don't want to move to
California I actually love Canada and I
love Toronto and it's just a clear
indicator that your perspective on
things can and will as you get older
change the things that you don't have
control over the way you feel about
those things is important do you accept
it G challenge it do you play the game
or do you change it it just boils
down to changing your perspective on the
things that you can't change to open up
space and room to kind of focus on the
things that you can or focus on having
fun with kind of working around the
things that you can those are challenges
and those are obstacles they're put in
our life to teach us something or
they're put in our life to help us grow
through it and find our own separate
paths and our own individuality that
kind of creates this whole life that
nobody else will live except for you
and anytime that you feel yourself
slipping anytime that you find yourself
suddenly just being so overwhelmed the
need to control and the need to you know
change or wish to change the things that
you can't then have a mantra or an
affirmation to back yourself up in those
moments and tell yourself like this is
how we slip back into the right for me
it's force versus flow anytime that I
feel myself you know feeling weighed
down by things that are really bothering
me that I can't control or find myself
feeling anxious about those things or
find myself feeling unmotivated or
uninspired by certain things then I tell
myself like force versus flow do I force
myself through this or do I flow through
it with that I can usually find the
answer that's gonna get me through to
the other side and even if I don't feel
clicked back into place right away I
still know like I'm either gonna push
through this and find an answer or I'm
gonna flow through it and let the
answers show itself to me no matter how
you go through it you will get through
it and no matter how you get through it
it's gonna teach you something and it's
gonna bring you something but no matter
what anchor yourself to something that's
gonna pull you back when you feel
yourself kind of slipping back into that
pour me my life sucks I have no control
kind of mentality Steph I am faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams just go ahead
let your hair down
you're gonna find yourself somewhere
somehow do as a sky sunburnt and lonely
to the tea in a bar by the roadside if
you're wondering what's in the smoothie
I will leave the ingredients to it down
below but carrying on to question number
four who are you who do you want to be
who do you know you are to your core but
you're just not letting yourself be that
person yet what are the things that
bring you more joy then you can even
contain yourself with when was the last
time you felt that way what impact do
you want to make on this world what
imprint do you want to leave on this
world or what impact do you just want to
make on your own you know self or the
people that you love or the people
around you what inspires you what do you
think you could be capable of what do
you know that you're capable of but you
feel like you're just not there yet
let's write them all down and get a real
good look at the person that you
actually are because our mistakes and
our feelings and our emotions as much as
they express who we are they aren't who
we are and so if you're in a place in
your life right now that you're not
proud of or you're in a place in your
life that you are unfulfilled by or
don't get enjoyment out of that doesn't
define who you are in fact it actually
does the exact opposite it shows you or
it is showing you everything that you're
not because if the version of you that
feels like you're stuck or in a rut is
who you are then you wouldn't feel like
you were stuck or in a rut write down
the person that you want to be and if
you find it really hard to do that write
down some attributes and some things of
other people just try to get the ball
rolling you know because odds are the
things that inspire you about other
people usually a reflection that that's
something that sparks something inside
of you so write those things down and
see what follows and write up all of the
things that inspire you that is who you
really are that is your higher self that
is the part of you that is intuitive and
it's trying to kind of guide you in the
right direction but your subconscious
and your belief system up until this
point is directing you the opposite way
so get out of your head and is lame and
gushy as the sounds go down to your
heart and ask yourself like who are you
really how can you have
that version of your back of course it's
great to have best friends boyfriends
brothers families whatever to have your
back but when it boils down to it at the
end of the day the biggest person that
needs to have your back is you when I
strip everything else away Who I am and
what I believe in at this moment and
don't don't define yourself by it too
because we're constantly evolving and
changing but if these are things or the
attributes that you wrote down are like
I care about other people or I want to
create or I want to spread a good energy
or good light or I get really excited by
photography or whatever it is you have
to then turn around look at that version
of yourself and say okay now I've got
your back I'm gonna make sure that I
don't start dancing with the devil on my
shoulder I'll tell him to kick rocks so
that we can keep you know going to our
yoga class and we can keep pursuing our
dreams pursuing our hobbies pursuing our
curiosity and our interests and
constantly evolving changing and pulling
ourselves into new inspirations and out
of old ruts okay I'm kind of getting
cold I feel like we should get this on
over to the Keene blanket is there to
say definitely not gangster enough to
have my head up I'm doing it anyway so
the fifth and final question and to be
honest the most important question if
you're gonna take any of them from this
video is what are you going to do about
it all I do think that the why and
establishing it is important in order to
understand it and move forward with the
right and correct action I think the
biggest and most important thing in all
situations is usually action this is an
area that I tend to struggle the most
with I love the idea of a good plan
working forward but then as soon as it
comes time to implement action it's
usually where I start to struggle I
think it's because we have to finally
let go of the things that we've been
holding on so dearly - like we almost
start to love our problems because they
give us a reason to complain they give
us a reason to not try as hard and they
give us a reason to kind of be a little
lazy and just accept that we have no
responsibility in our current
circumstance okay I can sit here and
complain about it or I can get up and do
something about it but
nine times out of ten I'm feeling a
little too lazy to actually do something
about it and if that's truly and
honestly the case then sometimes you
just have to be like you know what I
don't feel like changing this so instead
I'm just going to accept it but when it
comes to falling into ruts or feeling
like you're stuck in your life's and I
don't think that you should just accept
it I don't think you should let your
laziness win because like we just said
we have our higher selves back so for
that reason we have to put in action
even when we don't feel it even when it
doesn't feel right because action is
what's going to create the motivation
it's not the motivation that's gonna
create your action create some sort of
action do something about it do anything
I don't care if it's just as simple as
going for a walk to feel better in the
morning because that's going to show the
universe that you're serious it's gonna
show yourself that you're serious and
that's also just gonna spark even a tiny
bit of a good feeling inside of you and
that feeling is addictive and the minute
you feel that feeling you're gonna want
more of it and the only way to get more
of it is to create more action and more
action and more action and then all of a
sudden bopping around and realizing that
you're you're happy life isn't meant to
be taken as seriously as we make a
ten-speed goof off a little take it easy
you know pull away a lot of that
pressure you're putting on yourself and
just honestly simplify the situation so
that you can change the situation if
you're feeling like you're in a rye if
you're feeling stuck don't look at it as
you know a failure or a setback look at
it as your life or yourself or the
universe or whatever you believe in is
trying to send you a message the more
you ignore the message the more you're
gonna feel stuck any time I've seen
myself falling into a place in my life
where I feel stuck or a place in my life
that I feel unmotivated or uninspired
usually when I force myself out of it or
I get on to the other side of it I feel
better or I feel more in tune and sync
I've gained more knowledge and I just
feel lighter than I did before the whole
rut even happened
whether it's more knowledge whether it's
more insight more empathy more
creativity more inspiration more
motivation more imagination no matter
what we always come out on the other
side with more of something good look at
it as a project or a fun opportunity to
learn something about yourself learn
something about life try something
push yourself outside of your comfort
zone and know that at the end of it
you're gonna feel better than you did
going into it with that that concludes
today's stretch and talk I hope you guys
enjoyed it it was a little different I
definitely had to find a groove with
filming it it's probably going to take a
few stretch and talks before we fall
into a good routine with it but if you
guys liked it then just thumbs up or let
me know down below if you guys want me
to continue them if you have any more
topics you want to talk about and yeah
and with that I will see you guys all in
my next video bye guys
