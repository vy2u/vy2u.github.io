to be doing a fitness haul for you guys
and yes I just filmed one like five
minutes ago but I'm going to upload
these separately which I don't know why
I'm explaining that since I probably
have already done that but yeah I don't
know I'm saying this shirt though you
can find in my other haul which I'll
link down below since it has already
gone live and other than that I'm just
going to jump in and show you guys the
fitness stuff that I recently purchased
and if you guys have been watching my
vlogs or just following me on social
media or anything you will know that I
recently got back into running and it's
been about a month or it's been about
two months now that I've been running
again and it feels so good and I
promised myself because I hadn't bought
any fitness clothes for a little while
there that if I actually stuck to it and
kept on schedule and really got serious
about running again because I used to
run every single day I told myself if I
started doing that again and got really
serious about it again that I could
treat myself to some workout clothes so
it's been 2 months now and I've been
sticking to it and not only have I been
sticking to it I've just been loving it
it's not even sticking to it anymore
it's like I look forward to my runs
every day or every other day so I'm just
gonna jump in and show you guys a lot of
this stuff is pretty affordable it's
nothing too crazy like super high-end
brands so a lot of this is going to be
affordable and I'll leave all the links
I can find down below so first things
first I wore this sweater actually in
the other haul that I filmed but I
picked this up from forever 21 and I
believe it was about I believe it was 19
dollars but I'm not exactly sure but
it's just this gray really really thin
material sweater like crew sweater and
it says eat sleep run repeats which is
very suitable for the little haul that I
picked up because I have been getting so
into running lately and I just thought
this was perfect for that so it's just
this thin like heather gray sweater and
my favorite part is on the sleeves
there's like this mesh detailing the
next top that I grabbed from forever 21
and the thing is about this haul is that
I needed more so workout tops I have a
lot of bottoms like leggings and a few
shorts so you'll notice that the most of
this is going to be tops but the
thing I got from forever 21 is this top
here and this almost $15 and it's like a
neon green color and I love the
loose-fitting tops for running because
you know there's not like suffocating
you super tight and they're nice and
breezy and it is breathable and the
little tag on it says it wicks it's not
wicking fabric so it kind of wicks away
your sweat so you don't feel so like
damp and gross and it keeps you nice and
cool also before I go any further I'm
planning on doing a like workout
lookbook with all of these clothes so
that's why I'm not doing like a Tryon
but um I do have a slight fear I'm not
going to lie that if I do a video like
that I'll get a lot of hate for like
dress up to run you don't have to match
your outfit to workout that's stupid
but I personally am just somebody that
when I feel good I workout so much
better so when I kind of match my outfit
a little bit when I'm working out like
cute workout shorts with a cute colored
top I just I feel better so I workout
harder so I do workout and gross
clothing too but I just yeah
let me know if that's a video you guys
want down below I'll do it anyways I I
just want to know if it's something you
guys would even want to see so yeah if
you guys want to see like an outfit
video or just a lookbook or a workout
lookbook as weird as that sounds I can
totally do it just let me know if you
guys want to see it so next from
forever21 I picked up this sports bra
and this one was $19 and the thing I
like about it is that it's got padding
on the inside which is a nice for when
it's cold out so I picked it up in this
color here it's called tomato I believe
the color so it's a nice bright red and
I feel like I always go for neon purples
and greens and hot pinks and stuff and I
never go for like reds or primary colors
when I got workout gear so I figured
it'd be nice to have like a nice red
sports bra and yeah it's got the padding
in it and it said it it was a medium
support sports bra and the cool part is
the back it's like the strapping
detailing all along the back so next as
you guys know I'm from another haul I
was picking up a lot of these fitness
shorts from forever 21 and they are
amazing I love these shorts for running
they're so perfect and this pair was 19
have them in the black if you guys have
watched my other haul before this I
believe it is more so back in June or
July it just is like waterproof material
on top of built-in Spanx so you don't
have to worry about you know you can but
hanging out or anything when you're
running so they have like the built in
under layer which is nice and and it
wicks away the moisture and then on top
and it's got this just loose-fitting
waterproof or water-resistant material
and they're just so comfy and they're so
perfect for running and I'm obsessed
them so those are the shorts that I
picked up and I got them in like a
powder blue or baby blue and they're
just different than what i have so i
yeah i'm gonna say obsessed again but
I'm obsessed with them yeah this is the
top I got and I've been loving like
lavenders and pastel II purples lately
so this is the top and this one was 17
from forever 21 the top is like mesh
detailing kind of like mesh and
see-through and then the rest of it is
more of like a cotton and this is a
loose-fitting one which again is perfect
for running and the back has like a cool
just open that kind of scoop it like
scoops down and I just thought this was
really cute and just I know I love
workout gear and I love the color of
this and I have zero justification for
my shopping prop next top I got was this
one here and it's also from forever 21
this one was seventeen and it's just a
more like tighter fitting top and I love
the material this is super stretchy ones
and sometimes I just wear these even
like going out just walking around and
like a casual day outfit but it has this
a kind of like dotted straps going
stripes going down it kind of looks like
Lululemon in a way it's still really
nice because if you're cold again no one
can tell and it's just like a nice gray
color which you can't go wrong with gray
and then I also just picked up like a
white off the shoulder just sweatshirt
for running again and it also has that
mesh detailing on the sleeves but yeah
this one I picked up in white and it's
just I love these for running or just
lounging around the house these are
pretty much what I wear every single day
with leggings or shorts so this one will
be worn quite a bit as well so moving on
I went to blue notes and they had some
workout tops on sale I told you guys
that needed tops but
it's the first one I got here it might
not even show up on camera because it's
so neon oh it is but it's literally neon
highlighter color and this one was on
sale for $10 and again it has that tag
that says it's comfortable and
breathable and it also has moisture
control and wicks away sweat and all
that fun stuff and it's got a built-in
sports bra in the padding as well which
is just again just like always nice for
when you're getting cold or anything
like that so and then this one was on
sale for five dollars and it's just a
t-shirt style and again this kind of
looks like it's Lululemon which is crazy
because I got a $5 but yeah it's a
sky-blue or baby blue color again and
it's a nice super super stretchy and
that material that keeps you kind of dry
and keeps it cool and breathable and
it's just a really nice top this one's a
little bit more tight but it's really
nice for running or just going to do
weights with it and then last but not
least I did go to Lululemon and splurge
a little bit but I can't stand armbands
when I'm running I just can't stand I
change my music way too much to use an
armband and you're like kind of running
and just like trying to like adjust what
your date just is not fun so also I lost
it and before I even lost it like the
screen of it just got so gross and mucky
and dirty and I don't I just don't like
it so I have been using the DIY armband
quite a bit but I also lost that one so
lately I've just been sticking in my
sports bra which gets really gross and
sweaty so when I went and I asked the
girls like oh I need a really good
sports bra for running because I'm a
little bit bigger chested or just for my
side I need extra support so I usually
double up on sports bras but I wanted
something that was really good support
and she showed me this one and then said
also it has a pocket for your phone and
I was like okay sold I'll get that
please so this is what it looks like
here I got it in this kind of galaxy
which I'm sure you guys aren't surprised
that I picked it up in the galaxy style
kind of print and it's just got like
purpley blue pretty much yeah galaxy
with white dots all over it and you can
stick your phone on either side
whichever boob you're feeling that day
so that is the sports bra that I picked
up from Lulu
and then last but not least I got one
more workout top I'm done buying workout
tops for like two years but I think that
there's a baby soft pink colored one
from Lulu and it's just that really thin
material it's one of like the cheaper
tops you can get from Lululemon so this
is the one that I picked up it's just
like a nice just breathable like
material and just not again type and not
necessarily loose either just kind of
sits on top of you and I'm obsessed with
this color this is like my favorite
color this color and yellow whatever
this color it's a Corley light medium
pink I don't know so I hope you guys
enjoyed seeing my little fitness splurge
that I recently had if you guys liked
anything in this haul I'll try and find
as many links as I can and put them down
below and yeah I kind of I treated
myself to some workout clothes but I've
just been I don't know I've been really
happy and I've been working out quite a
bit and sticking to it and not only
sticking to it but I've just been loving
it and it makes me feel good and I mean
I don't know why I feel like the
constant need to justify when I do hauls
but I just I don't want you guys to ever
get the idea that I'm like oh my God
look at all this stuff I bought because
life there's more to life than stuff but
I just love watching hauls and I love
filming hauls and I love shopping so it
all just kind of meshes well together
but yeah I know let me know down below
what your guys's favorite workout is and
I will hopefully see you guys all in a
future Fitness Friday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
