huh oh-oh-oh loving you so so so so hey
guys what's up and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm doing
another get ready with me and the zodiac
series and Gemini it's your turn
I've been meaning to get around to this
video for so long but I was struggling
with how I was going to do the whole
twin thing but I feel like I found if
you like I found a good a good happy
medium where it was like wearable but
there's still some differentiation on
each side you know if this is your first
get ready with me zodiac then I will let
you in on what we've been doing this
year every single time that there's been
a new astrology sign of the year I've
been doing a get ready with me where I
kind of pull inspiration from that
zodiac so I'll pull inspiration from
their colors their symbols their themes
their characteristics the things that
they like it's literally just a fun way
to find new ways to get ready and try
new products and also just try new
styles and like force myself to branch
out done Capricorn Pisces Taurus
Aquarius I'll link them down below so
you guys can watch them all if you want
to you know vive your outfit or your
look at the day off of one of the
zodiacs but if you guys want to see this
look then definitely keep watching today
we're doing the Gemini their element is
air the dates for the Gemini are from
May 21st to June 20th their colors are
yellow green and orange which I was
really pulling from for the stuff it was
pulling the yellow and oranges for sure
the ruler is mercury again with that
orange and their strengths are being a
curious adaptable affectionate gentle
and the things that they liked when I
was looking up you know just general
Gemini's a lot of things came up about
liking books liking magazines liking
music liking to talk a lot just being
like super you know what I mean like
adaptable but also
chatty and they like enjoy being around
other people and enjoy just making
people feel good that was kind of like
the poll I was getting when I was doing
this get ready with me summer and
Happiness and just such a peaceful
enjoyable soul really good if you guys
aren't following me already I'm gonna
pop all of my good stuff up on the
screen we've got my Twitter my Instagram
and my blog which I post you every
single Friday so if you're new to the
channel definitely come check those out
and also subscribe and if you guys are
coming back
what's up Coast crew let's do this don't
be alarmed I'm about to swap to me with
no makeup lately I haven't been wearing
as much makeup like my go-to I should do
and update it every day at makeup
routine with you guys because my makeup
routine lately has like not changed and
I wear kind of like the same face if I
am doing makeup because I found one that
I liked that doesn't take me very long
to do and that I find is like natural
enough that you can wear it in the
summer but it's just like a nice little
enhancement of your features you know so
with this one I was like Gemini like
twins I could do such cool stuff but I
have to make it wearable because I'm
heading to Kingston today and I'm gonna
wear my face all day like this is a true
get ready with me I'm truly getting
ready for the day there was that and
then there's also just the fact that
it's summer and stuff and honestly I
just I want it to be light and fresh so
we're doing a light and fresh Gemini you
know but it's still it's still gonna be
Gemini infused so let us begin
so my foundation routine has still been
the same so I won't bore you guys with
that again I'm still wearing the bare
minerals bare Pro so I'm gonna start
with that then I've been using their
concealer as well bare minerals bare Pro
as well and I'm using light/medium
neutral um I stopped doing like the
super intense under-eye like light light
light was doing that for a while
decided that I wanted to make my face a
little bit more the same tone I guess
this has been really really good too and
then I'm just using a Beauty Blender
blend it all in
and once that boring stuffs done we'll
get to we'll get to the juice of this
video
to set the concealer I'm going to go in
with the Park Avenue princess by tart
and just use the one color called
enhance this this spell I use enhance to
just set the concealer so it doesn't
crease and then I'm gonna do my brows
because I just realized I forgot to do
them eyebrows are one of those things
that I'm so I struggled to trust people
with my eyebrows but lately they've been
getting a little out of hand and I can
tell that they need like a professional
to just shape them if someone messes up
your eyebrows they mess up your face for
life or at least for the months that it
takes to grow your eyebrows back in
you're putting a lot of trust in
people's hands you know for my brows I'm
using the Annabelle eyebrow pencil and
this is in the color taupe and I decided
to switch up my brows today try
something new I've been using the Tarte
brow stuff for so long that and I love
it
I just wanted to wanted to try some new
things I love a film and get ready with
me is because it forces me to branch out
of my everyday makeup and actually play
around with more products and stuff so
plus I feel like I wanted a bit more of
a defined brow for this look
okay next I was looking up the colors of
Gemini and their colors are mainly green
orange and yellow yellow being the
bigger one and because I've been
obsessed with warm tones lately and also
their planet is mercury I'm pretty sure
I decided to go with yellow and orange
in terms of eyeshadows so what I'm going
to do I have two palettes here I'm going
to be using the Urban Decay Naked petit
heat as well as the Too Faced peanut
butter and honey one of these has the
orange one of these has the yellow in my
actual crease I'm going to be using just
like a very soft color so I'm gonna go
in with the Naked heat and use vibrate
this color right here and just put that
in my crease just so that there's
something on top because I'm actually
going to do is put all the color
underneath and have it like sweat like
swept out sweep spit you'll see what I'm
saying I feel like that's an easy way to
just like pop some color on your face
for the summer without having like a
crazy smoky eye I'm gonna use some white
eyeliner to make it really pop and make
the colors really stand out but on the
top I'm going to go ahead and just do
something really soft get some vibrate
on here it just sounds so wrong to say
that but
all righty so I feel like for some
reason we're gonna go yellow left orange
right you faced peanut butter and honey
H by the way smells so heavenly I'm
using a honey buzz which is this yellowy
like golden yellow color I'm just gonna
like a load up my brush could spray this
now we're getting fancy you even makeup
tutorial and then I'm gonna do the other
eye with naked heat palette I'm going to
be using wild thing which is this like
burnt orange color and then doing the
exact same thing to this side
so I think I'm gonna skip blush and just
go straight to a highlight I'm gonna use
the NARS orgasm and it is the
illuminating a loose powder this is what
it looks like
hold up loose powders always give me
anxiety though because I'm such a klutz
nice okay I couldn't literally use all
the stuff off my hands comb dust that up
oh my gosh is so pretty just dust it oh
my cheeks
it's very rosy alright this is coming
together so nicely and then do I want to
do like a bolder lip or do I want to do
like a chill lip I'm thinking chill okay
so for lips I'm gonna start with the
buxom plumb line lipliner and this is an
incognito so I'll put this all over my
lips I really should have put on a chat
but yellow too lazy and then I'm gonna
go over it with Bites honeycomb there's
my little mini travel one it goes so
nicely on top of lip liner so that is
gonna complete the makeup I decided to
keep mascara only on the top just to
kind of enhance that underneath you know
like the yin and yang yellow-orange
thing go it got going on and then again
it's still wearable but there's some
color in there it's very summery again
with keeping like a summer vibe to this
because we are crawling into like the
beginning of actual summer I put my hair
into some coconut oil braids last night
knowing I was gonna film this today
because it's such an easy thing to do in
the summer don't put it above your ears
but take some coconut oil and coat your
hair from the ears down the road and
braids and then the next day when you
take them out it's like having mermaid
waves but there's no heat involved and I
find when you use the coconut oil to
braid it helps with the humidity and
like shake them out this has been such a
faith thing of mine to do now because
it's so just like at least you're here
feeling so nice this was like my 12 year
old move
and then once you shake it out so
because I'm still growing my bangs out a
little bit I thought it would be kind of
fun to take this like awkward front area
and do some things with the whole yellow
orange thing we got going on like
something that looks similar kind of
like twins but differentiates that there
are two different sides on the one side
I want to do braids and then on the
other side I'm gonna do twists summer
solstice hair thing going on and putting
it under some hair so there's the one
side and then I'm gonna do braids on
this side just gonna grab this section
and then before I pin it I'm just going
to use my fingers to kind of like push
it down you know what I mean like spread
it out just so the braid has a little
bit more volume and then it sticks out a
little bit more looks a little prettier
and then again I'm just gonna pin it
under some hair
voila then we go down together
we'll get away with everything the last
completes of the look of my Gemini get
ready with me for my outfit I'm just
wearing this tie shirt from Urban
Outfitters I actually picked up recently
so it should still be there along with
these pants which are also from Urban
Outfitters I wanted the outfit to be
summery and comfy wearing pants and like
pinstripes for some reason made me feel
like there was some differentiation with
the two side things we're doing I don't
know the bra that I'm wearing underneath
is from Victoria's Secret and my choker
is it might be from forever 21 I can't
remember I've got this so long ago it's
actually falling apart and I'm really
upset about it but I wanted to throw it
on there cuz if you like it pulls
through that that you know zodiac vibe
of this whole outfit I actually really
enjoy how this how this look turned out
and the fact that they didn't have to
use heat on my hair I feel like this is
a good we got a good summer vibe going
you know so with that I hope you guys
