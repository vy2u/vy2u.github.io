am doing a kind of a little spin on the
original get ready with me so I was
planning out videos for the fall and I
was writing down like a get ready with
me fall edition and I came up this other
like for some reason I wrote down got
ready with me for fall rather then get
ready for me or get ready with me for
fall I don't know anyway long story
short it may be think of this idea of
just kind of like doing this video where
it's like get ready with me for the fall
time rather than get ready with me like
a fall edition I'm still gonna be doing
another get ready with me that's just
gonna be like fall hair make up an
outfit but I figured this would be a fun
different way to do like I got ready
with me and maybe I'll do it for the
holidays too
I don't know we'll see how it goes over
so yeah so for this video I'm going to
be taking you through just like the
little steps that I do around the house
or just things that I like to do and get
myself like ready and festive for the
fall time I'll leave a list down below
of like point form of all of the things
that I kind of do in the video but other
than that if you guys want to see how I
get ready for the fall time then just
keep watching
so at the change of seasons one of the
first things I like to do is switch up
my summer clothes for my more fall
favorites so it's easier to dress more
according to the weather
so I'll usually do that around my closet
and dresser as well as just on my shoe
rack so I'll switch up my strap your
heels for more booties and wedges and
more fall appropriate shoes and then
that also includes my candles I'll swap
all my summer ones out for new fall ones
all around my room and just apartment
and the house and one of my favorite
things that I've been making for a
couple of years now is just this vegan
apple crumble so I will leave the exact
recipe down below but it's super easy
and really yummy so I just add a cup of
pumpkin flax granola a cup of brown
sugar
a cup of flour half a cup of melted
butter and yeah and then you just mix it
all together and then that is the
crumble portion and of course when I say
butter I mean vegan margarine so once
that's all mixed up I just lightly layer
this onto the bottom of a pan and then I
go ahead and just cut up some apples now
I recently went apple picking but you
can use any apples that you prefer and I
just go ahead and cut those up into
small chunks and then layer them on top
of the crumble portion
on fire
and then lastly I make one more batch of
the crumble and sprinkle it on the top
and don't forget to add cinnamon to the
apples as well and then just pop it in
the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes and
then that's it you're done and your
apple crumble is ready to go and of
course what would fall be without some
fall decor so if you're like me and you
got really enthusiastic about Halloween
I suggest you go to the dollar store to
pick up your decor it's just so much
cheaper and I just grab some random
things from my local dollar store and
just kind of put them all around the
apartment and in my room
also one of my favorite things to
decorate is usually flowers so I'll
switch those out for some more fall as
flowers too and of course with having
swapped out my closet some cute socks
and just like cozy sweaters and comfy
clothes are a necessity as well as
carving pumpkins this is usually
something I'll wait to do closer to
Halloween but since this is fake get
ready for fall video I decided to do it
a little earlier this year so I just
went ahead and carved a little pumpkin
and made him a face and used toothpicks
as teeth and carving pumpkins is
probably one of my favorite things to do
around the fall time so yeah I get way
too into this and without soup so I have
a favorite butternut squash soup recipe
that I'll leave down below for you guys
that I love making around the fall time
as well as just warming up some cider
you can do this with a little bit of
caramel syrup and some cinnamon or you
can just warm cider up on its own it's
such a good treat and probably one of my
favourite things to drink in the fall
and then last but not least on my bed
and on the couch and just in different
places around the house I like to swap
out some more accent pillows for the
fall time as well as blankets you'll
suddenly just define a blankets
absolutely everywhere in our apartment
so I hope you guys enjoyed this little
get ready with me for fall please let me
know down below what you guys plan on
doing to get ready for fall or tweet or
Instagram them at me and I will
definitely shout out my favorites and
other than that I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I'll see you guys all in
the next few Tober bye guys oh I guess
it's all work cuz they're still too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
