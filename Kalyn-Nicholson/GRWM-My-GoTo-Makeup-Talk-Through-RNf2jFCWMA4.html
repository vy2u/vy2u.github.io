putting a little bit of makeup primer on
I'm using the makeup forever
step one skin equalizer I've had this
for a while now it's not a recent
purchase so I know makeup forever isn't
cruelty free but I'm just finishing off
the bottle pretty much I'm also
extremely annoyed because I'm breaking
out so much more this month than usual
like I'm normally somebody that doesn't
break it out quite often but my skin
lately has not not been nice to me so
okay so my holy grail foundation it is
like my obsession I've been using it for
a few months now ever since I've moved
into this apartment is the Born This Way
Foundation and I am in the color sand it
matches my tanner I'm meeting up with
friends tonight to go see the movie me
before you we haven't seen it yet we're
in the group chat all talking about how
we are all in the mood to cry so um okay
my hair is really bothering me so I'm
going to put it back really quick so I'm
now going in with my NYX eyebrow cake
powder I'm just filling in my brows this
is like my all-time favorite brow
product that I've ever used but it's
easy and it gets the job done and yeah
then I'm just going to go in with a
little like spoolie brush it back and
then blending that all in just like
combing the hairs back brushed out I'm
just going to do it like my go-to look
kind of thing so I always usually use on
my Too Faced chocolate bar chocolate
bone bone I'm going to start with mocha
that's always the color I begin with so
it's this one right here so I'm just
taking a big fluffy blending brush and
just going to blend this into my dreams
okay so next I'm just taking four
Bordeaux and malted this brush is from
still spa Central's it was like two
dollars from Omer I'm just kind of
keeping this a little bit lower on my
outer corner like I'm not going as high
as I did with um mocha so I'm just going
to keeping it there and then blending it
back and forth I am like no way shape or
form an expert when it comes to makeup
it's just all trial and error for me I'm
not even going to pretend I'm like super
good at this I just always just throw
stuff on my face and hope it looks good
and you guys have been like requesting a
makeup tutorial for so long now that I
figured you know what why not
so I'm just taking my Sigma I shading
brush this is an E 55 and I'm going to
take a bit of like fix spray so this is
Smashbox photo finish primer water so
I'm just going to spray my brush with
this and then I'm going to take a
molasses chip and then I'm just going to
put this on the like first third of my
eyelid and then I'm just going to take
the blending brush again and just go
over my crease one more time real quick
so now I'm going to take my concealer I
am using the tarte maracuja creaseless
concealer and i am in the color lights
and i'm going to put this underneath my
eyes down my nose on my chin basically
anywhere I want to highlight so then I'm
going back in with the other side of my
damp Beauty Blender and I'm just going
to blend this in I only recently got a
Beauty Blender I purchased it when I was
in Vegas with Marissa lace and this
one's from like forever 21 it's just
like a really cheap one and I used to
use one a long time ago but I stopped
for whatever reason and purchasing this
is like it was the best thing I ever did
I absolutely love the way it blends
makeup and this concealer I recently
purchased this from Sephora like I would
be say maybe a week a half ago and I
really liked it but it is a little thick
so very quickly I'm going to go over my
face with my Too Faced prime and
poreless this is like my favorite
cutting a powder ever I'm just taking it
out a giant fluffy brush
and putting this all over my plate okay
so lately for the summertime I have been
skipping eyeliner and just going
straight to mascara so I'm going in with
my Too Faced better than sex mascara so
then quickly before I put anything on my
lower lashes I'm going to take a bit of
that Bordeaux and melted on a pencil
brush and just put this on my lower lash
line and I'm also going back in with
that eye shadow brush and taking a bit
of the molasses chip and putting it
right in the front here and then I'm
going back in and with the mascara on my
lower lash line I'm done taking a
concealer brush by Sigma it is the f7d
I'm just going in with this highlight
color right here capping off the excess
and I'm going to put this on at the arch
of my brow
and then I'm going in with satin sheets
which is this one right here and I'm
going to pop this in my inner corner now
normally if I was filming like videos or
I was going out to do any sort of live
blog posts or like a special event or
anything like that I would put on lashes
I've been like super obsessed with
lashes lately but because I'm only
heading to the movies tonight with my
friends I'm going to skip the lashes
when I go ahead and put in another two
or three coats of my mascara okay to
contour I'm going in with my Kat Von D
shade and light palette this is also
another recent purchase of mine from
Sephora and I haven't really built like
a full opinion on it yet I really really
like the contour colors gonna take
shadowplay first which is like the
medium color right here and I'm just
using like an elf brush it's a
complexion brush but I'm just going to
go into like where I would put my
obviously my contour and then I'm going
to go and grab ass ombre which is the
darker color and just tap that more so
on the outer edge of where I contoured
I'm not going to bring it as far in as I
just took the other one so just add some
like more dimension to the contour I
also kind of kind of like I don't even
know what I would call it like jiggle
wiggle the brush I guess up towards like
my hairline as well with whatever is
left over I used to be that person that
like did my contour way too obvious or
heavy and so now I'm like very conscious
of making sure that it's liked a little
bit more natural-looking than I used to
and I'm also going to take a bit of that
and do the same to like my jawline and
then I'm just taking this smudger brush
which is also from Walmart it's taking
the medium brown again tapping off any
excess and then just lightly doing the
bridge of my nose also for any of you
guys that might live in LA or San
Francisco be sure to comment down below
some cool places that we should check
out while we're there because we're not
from the area and though I've talked to
a lot of people that are from the area
we do have like a couple days that are
pretty busy I want to try and get in as
much as possible so like based on how
much you guys know me by now if you guys
know of any like good places you think I
should definitely get to or check out
and definitely leave them below you know
a lot of you guys will also been asking
if I'm going to be doing a meet-up while
I'm in like San Francisco
la and I'm not going to plan like a
specific meetup but if we're going to be
going to like a mall shopping one day or
if we're going to be doing anything like
that I will probably either tweet or
Instagram saying like oh we're heading
to the smaller I'm going to be in this
area of like LA for the day or San
Francisco so like any of you guys are in
the area want to bump into me that's
kind of the way I plan on doing um make
sure you're following my Instagram at my
Twitter because I'll definitely be
putting on like my social media where
we'll be so I'm taking lyric which is
like the yellowy toned um highlight I'm
just going to put this under my eyes to
get rid of like my darker circles so now
I'm just going to grab the hard candy
baked bronzer and heatwave I don't know
I like blush but I like the look of
being like a bronze goddess so I'm
taking a little bit of this on a large
powder brush by Sigma and then for my
highlight I'm just taking baked
Luminizer buy cheap Too Faced it's sweet
to you so it's like this little heart
thing here I'm only going to take a bit
off of this side so I'm just going to
tap my brush and then dust that over the
tops of my cheekbones okay for lips I'm
going in it with the I just picked up
this lipstick the other day from Sephora
it is the NARS lipstick and Barbara
blend to finish off the look I'm going
in with my smashbox instant matte
lipstick a transformer so this basically
just makes your lips matte no matter
what lipstick you put on so that was it
for my go-to makeup the only difference
on a day-to-day basis if i'm going to be
like filming or if i'm going to be going
out somewhere a little bit special or
anything like that is that I will add
lashes but other than that basically any
time I'm doing anything that requires
like leaving my house and putting a
little bit of effort into the way I look
this has been like my go-to look if you
guys want to see more makeup tutorials
or you guys like these like little
chitchat get ready with me then let me
know by giving me a thumbs up or saying
so in the comment section because I can
definitely feel more of these anyway I'm
