Bob
hi guys today is Thursday January 12th
now so I am officially doing my first
ever vlog in this place if you guys
didn't see last week's vlog it was my
moving vlog for moving into this
apartment so I link it down below or put
it somewhere up on the screen here the
whole family just wants all the
attention this morning so I literally
just woke up made myself a coffee I'm
also doing this challenge now where I
drink one full thing of this in the
morning and then one full thing of this
in the afternoon which equals three
liters of water so this is my am bottle
that's about as far as I've gotten just
since I was waiting for my coffee which
is pretty damn good I'm not entirely
sure what my day is going to consist of
yet today or a tea night so the
environment has been actually really
good and I had much time to like go and
explore trial yet because I was like
moving things on Monday and Tuesday
yesterday I had to get a video done so I
didn't really get to do much yesterday
aside from go for dinner that is like on
the agenda for this weekend first I need
this hot coffee to nourish mental
happy Friday the plan is I'm going to go
downstairs and go to one of the three
gyms I tried the one closest to my room
like closest to my apartment on
Wednesday so I think I might try a new
one today but yeah before I can shower
anything I'm like I need to work out and
I've just been slowly procrastinating it
the whole morning yeah it's just a lot
of stuff going on today but it's like
good happy stress we get a whole lot
done yesterday so it's building a lot of
furniture
I built my bed as you guys saw if you
guys want to see in the daylight I
haven't made my bed don't judge me but I
built this bed so I ended up getting
like a platform bed frame because my old
bed frame I know you guys loved it but
it was like really poorly manufactured
so this is like it's really really low
to the ground and it just pulls your
mattress off of the floor so it's still
really low which I was looking for I
started reading Red Queen which is
another update I need to update that on
my Goodreads account it surrounding me a
little bit of a selection series so I
was feeling I'm going to be obsessive at
that time I made my bed and got these
Friday things going
yeah
whoo
when you have to use the wine glass for
your smoothie moving Sharples drinkin
Zubin gone
Oh
coffee and uh
okay so I just got back from my workout
I tried to film as many clips as I could
wow this is like super bright what is a
little awkward because there's people at
the gym so I took a few clips of it just
to show you guys I'm now gonna hop in
the shower and get ready I have to head
to the mall today I might go see a
hockey game and then after that I am
going to go meet up with a friend of
mine for a couple of drinks tonight so
it's going to be a relatively productive
like not even productive it's a
relatively social Saturday which is nice
it's a nice change in my life with that
said I'm going to hop in the shower now
get ready with you guys during this vlog
because I don't know I was playing
around with my makeup last night before
I went and I've just been in this moves
lately where I'm like obsessed with
doing my makeup so I figured I'd give
you guys like a quick get ready with me
in this vlog shall we
hi
Oh
Hey
ah
so it's now at Sunday night this is
officially the end of this vlog and the
end of the first vlog in my new
apartment so I've officially been in my
brand-new apartment for a week and I
love it there hasn't been anything about
this week that I haven't pretty much
like as I'm figuring out the streetcars
I got to go to the mall I went shopping
I will did I do this week I like I'm
getting a routine down for the gym I'm
getting like a morning routine down I'm
getting I've met a bunch of people I've
gone and tried out a bunch of different
restaurant I don't know if it's just
because I moved that I'm like forcing
myself out of my normal hermit
tendencies or because being at home had
me in such a weird rest that I wasn't
even noticing it but I am so much more
I've done forcing myself to do a lot
this week and just like go out and meet
up with people and like yeah super
refreshing and relieving to know that
I'm not the old lady I once thought I
was so what that's not I'm going to
conclude the vlog here there's a bunch
of chunks missing from the slog where I
didn't vlog throughout the weekend so
I'm sorry if it was just super choppy
and like didn't make much sense but I
was trying to like settle in at the same
time well vlog so but I prom with you
guys next week's my life Monday will be
a lot more you know details I guess
opens when it goes is berry and coffee
so we'll do the grass you actually do
you can add I love you guys to the
moving back and cheers to my first week
in my new apartment
I hope only you guys are having an
amazing week or we're going to have an
amazing week and I'll see you guys all
on Wednesday's video bye guys
very first line this setup is very the
working one day but with that said I am
so so excited I'm loving my new
apartment cbyosu and moving block off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
