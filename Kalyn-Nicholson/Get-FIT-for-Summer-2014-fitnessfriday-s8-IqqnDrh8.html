hey guys so today for Fitness Friday I'm
going to be sharing some tips tricks and
a plan to get fit for the summertime so
be sure to keep watching to find out not
only how to get fit but a plan that you
can download yourself and join in with
me
so the first tips to success is to
always have a plan and you always want
to have a goal and a timeframe in mind
to make sure that we're holding yourself
accountable and making sure that we're
being realistic so we're going to start
out with eating healthy and some tips
and tricks to remember when it comes to
eating healthy and eating clean so the
first thing is that you never want to
skip breakfast breakfast gets your
metabolism jump-started it's going to
keep you nice and full and it's just one
of the most important meals of the day
guys I know everybody says that but it
really is true so I like to start my
breakfast with a smoothie but you guys
could start it out with oatmeal some
fruit there's really so many options but
just try to keep your breakfast as clean
as possible and try to at least have
fruit in the morning my favorite
smoothie personally is a banana and date
smoothie I drink it every morning
these deadbeat sounds only just to keep
it the next step is so important it is
to not starve yourself this is just
going to screw up your metabolism and in
the long run it's not going to help you
get fit or thin at all so instead of
starving yourself eat as much as you
want as long as it is clean and you want
to keep your food as natural as possible
so I am obviously a vegan I eat a lot of
fruits and vegetables but even if you
aren't vegan try and incorporate a lot
of natural foods that grow from the
planet into your diet lots of fruits
lots of vegetables and lots of natural
Whole Foods so this is basically what my
shopping cart looks like when I went
grocery shopping and here's just a good
idea of some of the things that I like
to pick up when fast buying some natural
Whole Foods
my next step is to stop counting
calories and start reading your
ingredients calories that go into your
body whether it's a thousand calories of
chips or a thousand calories of fruit
it's going to act so differently so
instead of obsessing over the calories
obsess over what you're putting into
your body and try and make sure you
understand the ingredients and that
they're not a bunch of chemicals or
processed foods so next I know you guys
hear this a lot but it's drink lots and
lots of water you're gonna want to drink
a glass of water and right when you wake
up in the morning and just refresh your
system this is going to help detox your
body and literally guys water is so
crucial when getting fit and lean and if
you're the type of person that kind of
runs around a lot then get a travel
water bottle and always carry water with
you girls are the only one
so now let's move on to exercise and
here are some tips and tricks to
remember when it comes to exercising you
want to get at least 20 minutes of
movement a day doesn't mean you have to
go to a gym or go on a run or exercise
but you just want to keep your body
moving so whether you decide to run skip
jump dance whatever you decide to do
just make sure you get your body moving
and at least 20 minutes a day these guys
little smile tell me that you're ready
and you're feeling the phone sometimes
and yes guys 20 minutes solo dance party
in Sioux County I won't forget you but
on me my next tip is to resistance and
weight train so I didn't get to film any
weight training that I usually do with
the gym because it just felt a little
awkward but you can do this at home too
with squats or any type of bodyweight
exercises just google them look them up
the ears are so important for getting
your body toned up
so I know a lot of you say you can't
afford a gym membership so seriously
take advantage of the internet
Blogilates is probably my favorite
youtube for workouts because she has so
many different things taught Pilates to
different songs
she has cardio workout so you can do
standing in your own bedroom so many
different types of workout she has a
beach theory so definitely check out
bodies for workouts you can literally do
at home for free I also like to look up
some yoga that I like to do at home too
when I don't feel like going to a yoga
class or I don't have time to so I will
link all these things down below for you
guys to check out and go do these
workouts right at home my next tip is to
get movement into your day walk or jog
with your dog or ask your friends to go
for a hike or a walk this is literally
you think that this isn't that much of a
workout but doing this everyday walking
your dog or walking with your friends
it's going to add up guys and not only
that you guys like it get to spend a
little bit more time outside with the
fresh air and nature
now this is obviously optional or you
can even do this as a DIY but I like to
inspire myself by getting some cute
workout gear because it makes me want to
put it on and then that obviously makes
me want to go to the gym if you guys
want to see a video on some DIY workout
gear that you can do for a really
inexpensive price than just thumbs up
this video and let me know down below
now this tip is really important for me
and it's to change up your music this
keeps me on track for my workouts and
makes me not be so sloppy and I
basically make a bunch of different HX
playlists other times if you guys don't
know what eight tracks is I'll leave a
link to it down below but I actually
made a playlist specifically for this
video called fit for summer 2014 so
again I'm going to lick that down below
and you guys can listen to it during
your next workout so this next one is
really important but I'm trying to work
on my flexibility by stretching both
morning and night this is so important
to prevent injuries and plus I just want
to be crazy flexible so it's always
jealous with people that were just
naturally that way so next is to have
fun guys this doesn't have to be hard
work feel free to dance like laughs make
goofy faces and do silly things and just
have fun with this and this reason right
here that you're watching me do this is
why I have to go to a gym to work out
because I just get so sidetracked 'add
next we're going to move on to the
mental aspects of fitness and these are
my tips and tricks to remember first is
I like to get some cute clothes or a
bikini or just something out of my
closet to hang up to keep me motivated
and make it so that I'm not going to
cheat on myself so I hang up my bikini
just to kind of look at it and be like
girl don't touch those cookies next is
to get excited be happy and pumped for
the summertime and that we're just gonna
have a really fun time getting fit the
next one is to obviously love yourself
you guys are already perfect the way you
are and then this one is so important
and it's to meditate I love doing yoga I
find meditation is so important with
staying into your body and staying happy
and honestly guys just meditate just
just do it and you don't have to do yoga
to meditate even just taking some quiet
time to yourself is so important
this next one is so important to get
lots of sleep guys when you don't get
enough sleep you're stressed chromosomes
spike and then you're stressed
chromosomes actually cause you to store
fat so you need to get sleep and you
need to let your body rest seven and a
half hours I'm pretty sure is the
ultimate goal Austin and keep doing your
thing yeah big boys keep slipping man
this one is probably the most important
one and it's to know that you're already
bikini ready you don't have to look a
certain way to be considered bikini
ready just throw on a bikini and you are
literally ready to go so guys this is so
important don't feel like you have to
look a certain way to be able to rock a
bikini or be bikini ready for the
summertime
you already are so I also made a daily
checklist that you guys can download
it's all going to be on my blog post so
be sure to check it out where you can
literally check these off every single
day and keep on track with me I'm going
to be doing these two so I'll leave
links to all this stuff down below it's
all going to be on my blog post where
you guys can download this full PDF it's
going to be just a PDF file or picture
file you guys can print it off and have
it with you or you guys can keep it on
your computer so this is the full result
I made it look really cute and fun and
I'm also going to link down below the
8tracks playlist that I was talking to
you guys about and I have some other
workout plans on there too and this
playlist includes all the songs that
you've heard in this video so I hope you
guys are excited to get fit for the
summer with me and good luck I'll see
you guys all in a future video
