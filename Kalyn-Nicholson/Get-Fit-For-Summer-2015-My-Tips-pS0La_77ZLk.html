don't mind my hair I just kind of
showered and let it go kind of dry
naturally so I feel like it's kind of
crazy looking or all over the place but
I really don't care today cuts through a
day so seeing as it is slowly / kind of
quickly moving into summer season I
decided to do as highly requested some
tips for getting or staying fit in the
summer time that said I want you guys to
know that you shouldn't obsess over
looking a certain way for the summer or
looking a certain way any time of the
year or that you have to look or be a
certain way to wear a bikini or whatever
just know that you're all beautiful the
way you are my main goal is just kind of
being healthier and happier so as long
as what you're doing is making you
healthy and happy then that's okay I
don't want this video in any way to make
you guys feel insecure this is just kind
of little tips and tricks and ways you
can get healthier for the summer and
also just feel better about yourself for
the summer also you might notice in this
video there are some clips that are from
other videos that's because I threw some
extra clips in there to kind of give you
guys more variety of the things I was
showing you in this video and also to go
along with the things that I was saying
that sad Ryan is going to be able to
come work from home for about two months
so I will have my filmer back to help me
out for a little while so expect lots of
pictures and videos so without further
ado here are my tips and ways to just
kind of get / day fit for the summertime
so tip number one is to keep unhealthy
junk food out of your fridge and
cabinets or throw it out so that you
have no temptations this has probably
been the biggest help for me and keep
healthy food at easy access and then tip
number two is to schedule your workout
so if I'm scheduling it in then I am
more likely to do it because I have
planned it out and I don't like to
scratch things out so when you schedule
ahead of time you're more likely to do
the workouts that you have planned
another tip that might help is to hang
out hang up an outfit or a bikini or
something that you have planned to wear
so that it inspires you not to eat those
brownies and then my next tip is super
important and it's to find good music
having good music can make or break a
workout for me so I always constantly
and updating my workout playlists and
finding good music to go along with
number five is to find some exercises
you actually enjoy whether it be yoga or
walking your dog or running you don't
necessarily have to go to a gym and then
tip number six is to find healthier
alternatives to your favorite foods so I
like to go on Pinterest and just find
some of my favorite all-time unhealthy
snacks and find vegan or healthier
alternatives to them tip number seven is
to pick from the fresh menu when you're
out eating since we tend to go out a lot
more in the summertime and I'm sure you
guys have heard this many times before
but drink a lot of water get a review
refillable water bottle this thing has
been my best friend especially in the
summer when we can get dehydrated super
easily number nine is to enjoy and use
the hot weather get off the couch stop
watching TV and playing video games and
go outside and do exercises or just be
outside and do activities outside like
hiking or going to the beach or whatever
it is that gets you outside and gets you
moving and most importantly guys is to
have fun
be sure to check out my blog if you guys
want to have an actual write out or
print out of all of these tips and I'll
see you guys all in a future Fitness
Friday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
