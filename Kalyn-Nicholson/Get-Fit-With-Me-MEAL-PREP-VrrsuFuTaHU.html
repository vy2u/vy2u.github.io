for today's video I'm doing a really
really quick and easy Fitness Friday
with you guys I'm getting back into a
routine that kind of requires me to do a
lot more meal prepping and a new gym
routine as well and today is going to be
the first day of that all the things
that I'm going to be eating for the rest
of this week and then if you guys really
like this video just go ahead and thumbs
it up and I can do more meal prep videos
with you guys so first things first I
picked up these Ziploc bags that are
specifically meant for going into the
freezer and then I'm going to start out
by making each smoothie bag by starting
with two bananas in every single one
that I peel and cut up
and since this week I was going for a
strawberry banana flavored smoothie I'm
going ahead and putting two really
really large handfuls of frozen
strawberries in each bag and then I'm
topping it off with filling the bag at
to the very very brim with as much
spinach as I can and this is really not
going to add any flavor to your
smoothies at all it just adds a ton of
nutritional value so I went ahead and
put those four bags in the freezer and
then every single morning I put it in a
blender with oats almond milk and water
and some vanilla and then blend it all
up and it's like a strawberry banana
smoothie so two meal prep my lunch I'm
starting off by baking four sweet
potatoes that I have punctured a bunch
of holes in with forks and then to go
with my baked sweet potato I'm making a
salad I didn't have enough containers
for this so I had to do double salad in
one container but then I'm just adding
chickpeas one full can of chickpeas and
once the four days and then this like
pickled artichoke and then cutting up a
bunch of cherry tomatoes and then each
day I just put a different dressing on
it but my favorite is like a lemon
garlic dressing that I got from farm boy
and then for the sweet potatoes I'm just
going ahead and taking all of like the
sweet potato meat out of the skin and
then adding pasta sauce I don't know I
find this really really good especially
with the farm boy pasta sauce it kind of
tastes like ravioli but I
I can eat pretty simple foods so this
probably looks really really gross to
some of you guys but I don't know I like
this kind of stuff
and then for dinner I'm making it two
boxes of quinoa I just went ahead and
did the directions from the back of the
box so it was four cups of water i
boiled that put the quinoa in and then
you lower it to a simmer and then you
let it sit for 15 minutes and then
fluffed the quinoa once it's done in the
meantime I also went ahead and cooked a
massive it was like three big heads woof
of broccoli and we went ahead and boiled
that and then I also fried up a bunch of
a bunch of vegetables sorry I went with
red pepper onion mushroom and zucchini
and then just fried that up once the
chemo was done and I also made sure to
use a nonstick pan so that I wouldn't
have to use any oil or anything
so after the quinoa was done I went
ahead and separated it amongst four
different containers as well as the
broccoli and roasted vegetables and then
adding on top a bunch of coriander or
cilantro and then some lemon juice as
well and then every day that I go to eat
it I just put on whatever sauce I'm
feeling that day sometimes I'll do the
lemon garlic you can do teriyaki
whatever you're really feeling and then
just heat it up and eat it so that is it
for the dinner portion of my meal prep
as for snack so the first snack I
decided to make was a fruit bowl so I
just went ahead and divided a bunch of
pineapple and some grapes just super
easy and I usually eat this after the
morning smoothie and then as for an
afternoon snack I believe a next time
I'm definitely going to do this with
hummus but I went ahead to divide in a
bunch of vegetables including a two
pound bag worth of carrots so half a
pound of carrots each day cucumber and
tomatoes and then you can take these
little containers here and put hummus in
it and use that as your dinner
so that was it for my meal prep that's
all the food that avoids me eating it
for a bunch breakfast dinner and for
snacks as well as like just well ante as
well I actually picked up a new
apartment T so yeah that's pretty much
kind of like what my new routine is
going to be on that I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will see you guys all on
Monday bye guys
you and me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
