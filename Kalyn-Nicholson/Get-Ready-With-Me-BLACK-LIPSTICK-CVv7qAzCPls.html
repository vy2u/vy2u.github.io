to my channel for today's video is the
eleventh day of u Tober and i'm gonna be
filming it get ready with me full of
this look I like to call it my wearable
Wednesday Addams
that's very usual I'm going to be doing
a like chitchat throughout the video and
I'll put text overlays of everything
that you guys need to know and if you
guys decide to recreate the look be sure
to tag me on Twitter and Instagram I'll
pop it up on the screen and aside from
that I guess we'll jump in because it's
a long tutorial you're so annoying
like mom let me sleep okay first things
first before we even begin you guys know
how I normally was wearing like these
metal cat ears they were actually from
last year I've been wearing them for
about a year now
those weren't Halloween ears that I
found at the store last year and the
other day I was at home for Thanksgiving
and I was walking through the store to
find something and I found new ears
they're Bentley ears they are literally
Bentley's ears no on every time I do my
makeup I am channeling Bentley just so I
don't bother you guys this whole get
ready with me I'm gonna put text
overlays for a lot of the stuff and so I
can play Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire will make this a chitchat I'll be
back we'll slowly little talking so I've
actually switched over foundations but
I've been trying to up the cap on the
locket Foundation I'm currently using
the color medium warm because I've been
self-tanning at home I use loving tan
and so I find this is a good match when
I wear the Tanner on my body and I wear
this on my face so I'm gonna start by
going in with that and like I said
there'll be text overlays for all the
boring stuff
I've actually recently switched over my
brow products I ran out of my Amazonian
clay I feel like I've been using that in
videos for I think that's been my go-to
product for like over a year now so so I
recently switched over to the benefit
curb brow this is like my favorite brow
product from a benefit I really like
like clays and like potted brow products
and then I've just been going on top of
it with the 24-hour sutter so like
setting them in place and then the high
brow by benefit as well and this is like
a highlighter s than my recent new
routine
so normally I don't do eyeliner often I
actually tend to hate the way I liner
looks on me but I find for me when I do
a black lip I like to wear liner just so
that it plays off of like you know
there's two very solid that like black
things going on on my face and I also do
think black lipstick can look really
cool if you keep your eyes almost kind
of naked but since I'm going with such
heavy lashes I feel like I need to kind
of give them a base with the eyeliner
and looks pretty guard like I usually
suck at doing eyeliner because they
don't do it often so fingers crossed
that I can get that kind of like shoes
with cat eyes
so now from here you can obviously add
another coat and you would be totally
fine but I'm gonna be filming today
which is my lame excuse for wearing
lashes I've just been obsessed with
wearing lashes a lot lately I just like
how dramatic and full they aren't I
I don't know why but this time of year I
just like doing way more dramatic makeup
so I'm gonna go ahead and add my velour
for the fluffing six so now moving on to
the lips for whenever I do really really
dark lipsticks one thing that I try not
to do is ever put mascara on the bottom
of my eye only because I just find it
looks a little bit too harsh for me
whenever I wear super dark lips I'm like
not makeup expert this is literally just
been from trial and error and also I
find too if you are a little bit afraid
to kind of dabble with black lipstick
some other things you can try - or like
dark Browns dark purples like the moon
by Kylie that I've been wearing for
quite a bit and then this is another one
this one's by M cosmetics and it's in
Spanish earth so this one's like a dark
brownish purple if you're afraid of
playing around with blacks I suggest
like you know starting with colors like
this
so this is Spanish earth by UM cosmetics
so this is like a super perfect backup
if you don't want to try black lips but
I'm actually gonna go ahead and throw on
the black because I haven't rocked black
lipstick yes this year and so I really
need to this is actually gifted to me
with like a Halloween makeup set so I'm
gonna give this one a go I mean I
probably shouldn't be throwing it right
on top of this but like I said I'm not a
makeup expert so we're just gonna go
so there you have it this is my go-to
look when I'm doing any sort of dark or
black lipstick and then ask for my hair
my messy bun at technique is to call all
my hair to the top of my head
take my hand into a claw like shape and
comb the fingers like like stick them
straight through like a shish kebab into
the hair and then have the elastic on
that hand and wrap it around twice kind
of leaving it messy and then as for my
outfit the sweater that I'm wearing I
got from a ritzy ax but I picked this
one up from a Ritz and it's like higher
in the front and lower in the back so
it's perfect to top over like a good
black skater skirt and then the skirt
itself is actually from Nordstrom and
then the booties you guys have seen
these booties a bit in Utah over so far
but they are from all the Shoetique and
they are my absolute favorite and so
this completes my wearable wednesday
addams inspired makeup I hope you guys
enjoyed today's get ready with me and
other than that I love you guys to the
minute I hope you've been enjoying all
the you Tober videos so far big thumbs
up if you have been and aside from that
I'll see you guys all in tomorrow's
video bye guys
