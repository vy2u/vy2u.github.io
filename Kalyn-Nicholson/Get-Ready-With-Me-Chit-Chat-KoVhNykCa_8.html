a get ready with you guys today I did in
fact wake up like this I have some
filming to do today and then I'm going
to meet with some friends later so I'm
starting out with my Too Faced Born This
Way Foundation as always actually mixing
nude and sand together so now I'm using
up my Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof
brow mousse
I said hey babe so then I'm going in
with my morphe brushes it's like the
Jacqueline Hills favorites palette I
don't think it's available anymore so
I'm starting with this like matte color
it's kind of like warm sand
she said taken I'm having to concentrate
some of this like darker burgundy on the
outer corner of my eye and then just
taking this champagne color it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it on a slick
of flat eyeshadow brush and to create
some sort of like transition within the
colors I'm just taking this rose gold
and putting that more towards the middle
of my lid and then just touching back up
with the blending brush and a little bit
more of the dark burgundy I was thinking
but you all do mom Oldman real cooz Oh
beautiful so for concealer lately I've
been using the tarte maracuja creaseless
concealer I do really like it it does a
really really good job at concealing
like dark circles and stuff but I do
find it to be a little bit thick I would
just suggest if you do decide to try
this concealer out to get a really good
setting powder for it
Oh
and then to set my highlight I'm just
using the Kat Von D shade and light
palette I'm obsessed with this thing it
was one of those things that my friend
told me to buy she said it was one of
the best purchases she made so I decided
to give it a go and as you guys probably
know now it's been in a lot of my
tutorials obsessed with it I like to set
with the yellow tone one under my eyes
because it helps like with the purple
and then I go back over everything with
the more ivory highlight to really like
make it pop you know so then I'm going
back into the morphe palette with a
pencil brush and I'm going to line my
lower waterline with the same dark
burgundy shadow and then I'm going back
into that champagne color and using that
as a highlight okay so for eyeliner I've
been like obsessed with L'Oreal's
super slim it's like the new infallible
12 hour eyeliner the only thing is is
that I noticed a lot of you guys were
commenting that L'Oreal isn't cruelty
free so I'm trying to be aware of only
purchasing cruelty free at this point
right their website and their website
says they are cruelty free so that's
what I was going off of so if any of you
guys know like the legitimate answer can
you guys let me know down below because
it will break my heart so I'm obsessed
with this eyeliner it is so good so
usually two to three coats of this does
the trick but yeah I'm gonna add lashes
today because life is short but your
lashes don't have to be she's
hello taking you home
and then I'm going to use my shade and
light palette again to contour my face
I'm just going to use the medium brown
today because I don't know I just don't
feel like doing that intense of a
contour
so then I'm just going back in to chew
on my morphe palette and taking
champagne color and using that as a
highlight on the peak of my nose and did
I just say the peak of my nose yes I did
and my cheekbones and then I'm going in
with my splashed pops be legendary of
burgundy lipstick for my lips
and that completes the makeup look as
for my outfit for the day
I am currently wearing a cropped black
the bell sleeved shirt from forever 21
and then I'm just wearing a bralette
underneath because kendall Jenner said
it best either bralette or braless and
then I'm just wearing some dark wash
jeans from Hollister and the little rain
boots that I picked up recently from
Charlotte Russe it is currently raining
outside and I'm really diggin it and I'm
really pumped that I got an excuse to
wear my new river bins so that was it
for my look today thank you guys so much
for getting ready with me this is like a
really fun video to film because it's
like getting ready with a bunch of
friends so you guys like this video
thumbs it up and other than that I will
see you guys all in tomorrow so you
tober bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
