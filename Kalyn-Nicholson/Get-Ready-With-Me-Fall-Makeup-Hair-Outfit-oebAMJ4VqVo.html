going to be going through get ready with
me for this past weekend I recently had
Canadian Thanksgiving so I decided to
film just like a little get ready with
me for my makeup and my hair as well as
just the outfit so I will leave all the
details and products that I use down
below well
cruelty free alternatives and I do have
a vlog coming up that has to do with
cruelty free makeup so watch out for
that and other than that I hope you guys
enjoy watching me get ready and yeah
I'll let you guys know where the outfit
is at the end
also if you guys have preferred me to do
more kind of like a talk through get
ready with me just let me know down
below
I usually just film it like this and
speed it up so you guys can see the
process nice and quick because I do have
a tendency to jabber quite a bit but if
it's something you guys would rather see
me kind of like talk through as I'm
getting ready then just let me know
because I can definitely do one of those
too and yeah pretty much digital
we're just
to ourselves
so as for my outfit the entire thing is
pretty much from forever21 except for
the scarf and the satchel so I will
leave links down below to similar items
or the exact items if I can find them
and I hope you guys enjoyed getting
ready with me bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
