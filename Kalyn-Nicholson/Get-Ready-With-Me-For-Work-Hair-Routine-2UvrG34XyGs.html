my channel for today's video I decided
to go get ready with me video since it's
been a while since I've kind of gone
through like the makeup I've been doing
lately and just showing you guys kind of
like my fair routine and slash a go-to
outfit today I'm just getting some work
done I'm going to be filming I have to
run around and grab some things for some
videos and just amongst a few other
things so I figured why not film with
you guys kind of like my process of
getting ready for a standard work day as
a like YouTube work day if you guys
enjoy this video then thumbs up or let
me know down below because I can very
easily it so more of these style and
also if you guys aren't following me
already definitely check out my Twitter
at my Instagram I have been going social
media overload lately and it's been it's
been it's been quite nice my stockpile
of Instagram is so high right now and
that's such a satisfying feeling wow I
found so basic but an issue I do have
quite stuff that I'll leave all them
social links NAMBLA and other than that
if you guys want to get ready with me
for this look and just keep watching
that's really weird that cut shop
probably scared the crap addi
here's what we're going to deal with
this after we deal with this um but
first and foremost okay so let me just
lick the side of my coffee cup first
things first
my foundation is probably going to look
a little orange just because I am
wearing tanner but I have to match the
rest of my body so that's just kind of
my disclaimer prior to putting this on
my face every time I sit down to go do
my makeup
I always forget to wet my Beauty Blender
for foundation lately if there's two
different foundations that I've been
using the
higher-end one is the Too Faced Born
This Way you guys probably already know
this if you've watched any of my other
get ready with me or tutorials or
anything like that
something I'm also currently obsessed
this is my L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
and it's weird because I'm more of a Mac
gal myself before anyone jumps on it
L'Oreal actually is cruelty free if you
guys didn't know that I had the chance
to go to France with Biotherm and they
are kind of like a brand underneath
L'Oreal L'Oreal itself doesn't test any
of its products on animals aside from
their hair products and their hair
products are only tested on animals in
China not in any other country and
they're actually proactively working
with the government in China is try and
change that but all of their products in
Canada in the United States everywhere
else are not tested on animals and
especially not their cosmetic luckily I
found that out and that was a really
cool thing to learn because L'Oreal is
actually one of my favorite drugstore
brands and knowing that they're
proactively working to finding
alternative testing in China it's just
so cool that the world is becoming that
kind of place where all of these brands
are starting to catch on and they're
like okay let's stop testing on our
beautiful furry little creatures they
actually design they put like billions
money into creating a synthetic skin
that reacts the way human skin does and
that's actually what L'Oreal tests their
makeup on I feel like I should just make
that disclaimer that's kind of like my
Intel but that's that's as far as I know
let's move on so I feel like in terms of
how dark my skin is today so this one
might be a little too dark I'm going to
lighten it up a little bit with the
L'Oreal pierre globe a lot of foundation
but i got a last piece and for concealer
i'm going in with my two babies born
this way naturally radiant concealer and
i'm in the color light medium
I literally stayed up so late last night
guys honestly just in general my lack of
sleep lately is kind of disgusting
between all the back-to-back trips and
just like not sleeping when I do get
home I swear I just need like after this
Scotland trip I'm going to need a solid
four days to just catch up on sleep
that's where I'm at with life so for
eyebrows I'm going to go in I'm gonna go
to eyebrows I'm going to use my
Annabelle stay sharp self sharpening
waterproof brow liner so when I was
actually way my homegirl Val sent me of
The Naked 2 palette I've been wanting
this honestly since The Naked 2 palette
became a thing I always wanted it for
whatever reason I just never I just
never bought it like I don't really go
to Sephora often opening my parcels last
night and I was like Val you sneaky mom
and so I'm going to be using my naked 2
palette for my eyeshadow today this is
an epic moment because this is like me
using it for the first time as I get
ready
Hey
Oh
no one in my waterline with this Urban
Decay 24/7 waterline eyepencil this is
in walk of shame I find just doing this
like opens up your eyeballs it just
makes your balls
it makes your balls big no but actually
though it does make your eyeballs would
be so I let that like kind of mascara
set before I put lashes on because this
is a filming day for me and also just in
general
I've been weirdly obsessed with gluing
furred my eyes lately so what do I feel
like contouring was today so I'm going
to use my melt chocolate Soleil I've
been doing a little bit more of a subtle
contour for spring I find the melt
chocolate is like it does the job in the
sense where it gives you that contour
but it's subtle enough that it's not
like BAM you know what I mean like it's
not like Kim K baked it's just like I'm
here if you need me see what I mean you
see that
okay so as far highlight Val actually
also said to me the Jean Mitchell
Basquiat I hope I pronounced that right
he was like a really really cool artist
and Urban Decay launched us like
miniseries of better car that's kind of
like inspired by his art and so this
palette is in that theory this is like a
contour and highlight palette and like
blush so there's two blushes a contour
and I'm going to be using the highlight
so the highlight is called now's the
time and I'll zoom in on my face you
guys can like really appreciate the
application
I feel like it totally just speaks for
itself
and I think I want to like keep my lips
a little subtle today I was debating
doing moon by Kylie but I think I'm just
going to go in with blondie by bayi it's
this color here and so I'm just going in
with Annabelle's buff as my lip liner
now I'm just going to throw on some
lashes and then we'll move on to the
main course no pun intended
okay so for my hair I'm going to try and
recreate like a blowout - the actual
blowout so I blow dried my hair upside
down to give it a little bit morton's
and then I'm just going to straighten
most of my hair and then the trick is to
kind of concentrate on curving in the
front to give it that kind of blowout
style and I'll just like speed this
thing forward to the good stuff you know
so for the last layer what I'm going to
do is take try and take like smaller
chunks brush it out first and they on
curve your straightener inwards you'll
see what I mean I'm going to twist it's
hard to explain we're just going to roll
with it and see what happens the other
thing you can do too is like curve it
towards the back of your head and then
it will come back forward and kind of
like turn and
so as for my outfit for the day
today is just a workday so I'm keeping
it kind of casual today I just took a
white t-shirt I tied it up with a little
elastic bands and then I threw on some
black dark jeans these are from urban
planet and then as for my jacket you
guys would have seen this in my haul
video and probably in my last vlog as
well but my floral jacket from Lulu and
I've drawn these blacks kind of like
cowboy meets rocker boots and they're
super cool again they're from blues
leave all of those links down below for
you guys so if you guys want to check it
out that concludes that might get ready
with me I hope you guys enjoyed this
little chit chat run-through of getting
ready for a workday slash filming day
with me when I do different looks for
different things like going out maybe or
like on a Sunday or for brunch things
like that if you guys want more of these
especially with spring and summer coming
up and there being so many new outfits
and makeup looks I want to try just
thumbs up or let me know down below and
then that I will see you guys all in my
next video stay weird guys I love you I
can't
you can stay with the latest now trying
to sleep
exit are your cat while I started to
smoke that you change the tracks that
are kinda bad and my cell mate obsession</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
