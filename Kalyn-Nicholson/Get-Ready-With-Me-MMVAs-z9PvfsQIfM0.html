go to the MMVAs and I filmed a little
get ready with me so let's get started
I'm currently mixing together these two
foundations and I'll leave the product
list down below of everything that I
used but I decided to mix these two
together it was a lore'l foundation as
well as a bourgeois one two three
perfect and then I'm just going in with
some elf concealer and then I'm just
going to blend that in with a damp
Beauty Blender and then like always I'm
just setting everything in place with a
transparent setting powder and I'm just
using one by Too Faced so then I'm going
in with my makeup Forever aqua brow and
I'm just going to lightly fill in and
just kind of shape my brows I'm not
gonna go too crazy with this and I
actually recently send out my brows so I
didn't need to do too much other than
just fill in the sparse areas and then I
just went in with a little bit of
product on the inner corner and then I'm
actually just using the bronzer that I
use on my face kind of like a base for
my eyeshadow so that it will blend more
easily since it is like a matte medium
brown color I just like to use the
bronzer itself and then of course I'm
going in with my covergirl little
palette here and I'm just using the
darker color on a big fluffy brush to
blend it into my outer corner and like I
just said that matte color that we used
before kind of helps it blend better and
then I'm just using a damp brush to put
the metallic color on the outer third of
my eye and then I'm just going in with
mary-lou manizer to add a little pop of
color in my inner tear-duct this has
been like my favorite eye shadow kind of
set up lately so that's basically what
I've been doing
and I'm sure you guys won't be surprised
to find out I'm going in with my
covergirl super sizer mascara like I've
told you guys before it's my recent
favorite and I just like that it really
separates my lashes and the coke kind of
stays wet so you can really build it up
and then I'm just gonna go in with some
falsies as per usual but again it this
is always optional I just always like to
find any excuse to kind of go a little
bit more dramatic with my lashes pS guys
sorry for other dancing we were
listening to some pretty intense music
while we got ready so I couldn't help
but kind of dance in between each shot
but then I'm just going in and
contouring my face with my Too Faced
matte chocolate Soleil bronzer which is
my favorite as you guys probably know
and I'm just using a really really big
fluffy brush so that it blends in all
nicely and then I actually picked up a
little lip duo from the mall that day
from Mac so I'll leave the exact names
of the colors down below but I wanted to
go for like a baby pink color because of
the baby pink that was gonna be in my
dress so I went ahead and picked up a
lip liner and a lipstick since I forgot
to bring a baby pink color with me and
again I'll leave the names to it down
below but I absolutely loved the turnout
of the color so yeah that was what I did
with my lips and then to top the whole
look off I'm just going in with a blush
very similar to the color of my lips so
now it is time to move on to hair I just
kind of brushed out my hair and decided
to put in my extensions like always it's
optional I like to wear my hair without
extensions sometimes and sometimes I
like to wear it with it's really just
how I feel that day so I put in my
extensions and these are my irresistible
knees and I will leave a link to them
down below and then I'm just using a
Bellomy curling wand it's about a
one-inch curling wand to just kind of
curl all of my hair away from my face
and blend it all in nicely oh yeah
and of course go ahead and do that to
the other side as well but be careful
not to burn yourself if you plan on
dancing while curling your hair because
I ended up burning my thumb a couple
time
so to keep everything in place I'm just
going in with my Pantene hair spray and
this has been my favorite hairspray for
quite a while now and I'm just kind of
going in afterwards with my dry defi
which I've told you guys before but you
can net blend this into your entire head
even up to your roots and it just kind
of makes your hair feel like velvet so
this is probably one of my all-time
favorite hair products and must-haves
and as for my outfit thank you guys for
those of you who are on Twitter who
helped me pick out this dress out of the
two options that I had I'll leave a link
to it down below and be sure to also
check out the vlog from the weekend
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
