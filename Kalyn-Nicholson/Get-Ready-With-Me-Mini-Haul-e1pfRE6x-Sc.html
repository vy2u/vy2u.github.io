ready with me video I just kind of
wanted to show you a couple things I
just got from Walmart and you're gonna
see them in this video
what the hell is that and what's she
doing oh okay sorry bout that she's got
a little bit sidetracked right there
um just saw that at my window and was
very confused okay so I just want to
show you guys a couple things I got from
Walmart before I jump into my get ready
with me video um one thing I'm going to
be doing a video on these two items
together these are both self tanners and
I wanted to just show you guys a
self-tanning video if you guys are
trying to keep away from tanning beds to
the Sun because it is bad for your skin
so it's going to do a self tan video and
a review on these two but I did get
these and wouldn't be using this in this
video actually as well this is just the
Sally Hansen airbrush legs and this is
the bonnibel golden tanned face gel it's
like a face moisturizer almost okay next
I got the L'Oreal True Match Lumi I
wanted to try out this foundation I
haven't tried it yet so I will let you
know I'm going to try this in this get
ready with me video - want to try that
one it I also got the Maybelline instant
age rewind because almost like everyone
on YouTube is using this and it looks
like it works really well and I've been
meaning to buy it for a long time now
kept thinking about it so I finally just
caved in and one in sure I wanted to try
it so I caved in and went and bought it
um I got the Wet n Wild uh lipstick and
pink sugar and I'm gonna wear this today
too so you guys are going to be able to
see that one as well and last but not
least I got this because it was on sale
it was in a bundle it is the maybelline
nearly naked makeup the foundation and
it's also the face cream and it's in
medium and it was the only color they
had left but I have been getting pretty
tan lately so and it's summer nails so
this should be able to work so this was
on sale for 10 and it was in a bundle
which is really cheap so I got that as
well and now I'm going to just carry on
with the get ready with movie
and yeah the deeper that I fall the more
did I ignore them
you should have let me drop someone
else's problem
people that I phone
you should have let me drive
the rain
Hey
yeah
Hey
I'm standing on your porch knock an inch
or two
see no competent tribunal footsteps hit
the floor
you never coming back to me dancing on
your roof singing with the
said that I could stay but my feet alas
the words
you know it's all coming
you never come
as far as I can tell this far
see and how could you
how could you
you
and if I can call it that
the best be heading home
it's not this
since you left try again
don't you
so far feels like something's missing
too
I looked up see if someone's listening
to fine July
side
soon
it feels like you forget
like you always
