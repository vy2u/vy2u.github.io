baby
copy believe we'll get every test might
sleep alone in the car with my team
again think about you you think about me
thank you guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm going to
be doing a get ready with me because
it's been a while since I filmed one
actually I think it was like this summer
wedding one was the last one when I film
so I'm going to be filming anyone with
some new products and I'm trying some
products at home cephalus and products
that are like must-haves for the fall
time to call it transitional makeup
because there's definitely a ton of fall
colors that I used in this and I've just
been so like inspired by autumn lately
and just being so excited for you tober
and all of the things that autumn
promises including the fact that I just
bought a new candle from Bath Body Works
yes they have to them so if you guys
want to see a full get ready with me for
this makeup look as well as an outfit of
the day then just keep watching ok I'm
starting off with the music that's
actually for a little while now it's the
Urban Decay b6 vitamin abused complexion
prep climbing spray I'm so extra basic
flip my hair as I said back well kind of
feels nice like a nice wake up for the
morning oh and I forgot to put right
here I'm listening to my Sunday
afternoon playlist which kind of reminds
me it's like if you want to listen to my
fall playlist but you're feeling like
you don't want to spoil it too soon for
fall then go to the Sunday afternoon
playlist because it's all of like the
same style of music I know it's like my
body can tell that fall is on the
horizon and everything I do is
manipulated by the idea of fall you're
going to see some fall colors in this
video so for foundation I'm still using
the Urban Decay all nighter waterproof
long-wear
I usually mix this with my tinted
sunscreen from Kiehl's or I'll mix it
with another foundation so I'm using up
what I have less of my L'Oreal True
Match so I'm going to mix these two and
then I'll move on to concealer and the
concealer that I'm going to be using is
my nards light 2 vanilla it was actually
Elena this only
pick this up and it is so good I ran out
of my YSL so I've moved on to this and
another
so since em I think they just use my Mac
Previn Prime I had this in my makeup
collection because I ran out of my
toothpaste and I really need to go pick
that up actually need to go pick that
out the Beauty Blender because it will
do if you guys want to do like a a fall
makeup haul thumbs us up because there
are a few things that I need to go pick
up and it would be like a cruelty-free
haul so if you guys want to see that
definitely thumbs this video that is
really used to set my face for now and
then they're not going to be surprised
by this if you've seen any of my other
like get ready with me I am still using
of my Tarte Amazonian clay hope guys
this has lasted me forever
this is like I just have to give such a
shout out to it because how long as it
lasted is insane so if you guys are
looking for the corral mood I definitely
recommend picking up the Tarte Amazonian
clay because it lasts forever and it's
goofy freeze
so next I'm going to be using my naked
urban decay heat palette this is like a
newer palette that Urban Decay has come
out with guys this is going to be such a
freaking staple for me in the fall look
at the colors this one is officially my
new favorite because it's one like all
the warmest most fall colors that you
could ever ever get a palette also too I
find depending on your eye color like
this is good for any technical eye color
because there's some purpley tones for
like green eyes there's some warmer
orange tonsure blue eyes and brown eyes
can wear pretty much every single
eyeshadow but I just find especially the
warmer tones tend to pull out like the
blue in my eyes which I really enjoy so
this has been my all-time obsession
lately I will list the colors that I'm
putting all my eyes as I do them
Oh
colors in this palette are frickin bomb
I I can't express to you my excitement
for fall I'm sure you've already picked
up on it based on the fact that I've
already talked about fall of it like
seven times just want to bathe in
Sandman Dulce and put pumpkin colors on
my face so I'm taking the same colors he
devil and and few goals and I'm going to
put those underneath my lower lashline
again especially with the warmer colors
I initially was going to do this I was
like a summer like a subtle summer
makeup but I feel like I've done that
tutorial so many times like all of my
other get readies with me aside from the
wedding one it's kind of like my chill
makeup I want to do something a little
bit bold fun you know also I was
watching Harry Potter when I went to
sleep last night and I feel like the
colors that I'm counting my face with
right now are Gryffindor and me
so I've been doing the same thing where
I'll put like a pop of color with
eyeliner on my lower lash line initially
I was doing the Urban Decay torch and
this also is like part of the heat
collection but today I decided to try
the alkaline and this is the first time
I used it and I like I like it a lot
like it's definitely more fall but the
purple again I find it's like pulling
out the blues and so I'm really enjoying
it like a deep plum focus
so now after lit I wanted to try one of
the new em cosmetics lift colors these
were recently sent to me and again
look at these colors they're like all so
false so I have rode nude faded
Clementine and violent magenta those
really Sworcery colors and I'm trying to
decide out of right now oh okay so
that's the fate of Clementine
oh my god okay maybe that one Oh Frick
this is going to be hard
so let's know Rose knew that here I'm
going to be min for you guys I think I
might do orange Clementine there we go
and see if it's too much if not I'll
switch over to the Rose nude okay so
this is definitely a bomb color but I
feel like it's definitely not meant for
this tutorial I might wipe it off and
switch over to the Rose so that
concludes the makeup my camera shut off
just before I finish the top lip but I
ended up going with Rose nude for my
lips it is by I'm cosmetics I'm like
actually really obsessive them I think
that these are going to be such a huge
like fall thing for me this year but
yeah so my hair is already straight so
I'm just going to go ahead and leave it
like it is and then as for my outfit I'm
wearing this ACDC shirt that I got from
brandy melville and then my jeans are
from Zara they have like the textured
detailing all over the knee a really
cute pair of shoes that you could pair
with this for this outfit are these red
pumps that I have a little Shoetique but
if I'm being honest with you guys I'm
not going to go walking around in pumps
for no reason if this were to transition
into a nighttime outfit I would
definitely wear the pumps but for the
daytime I probably just wear a pair of
black booties just so that been
uncomfortable and because for the fact
that I'm literally just going to
Starbucks to work on feels and a couple
other things so I don't really want to
put myself through wearing heels when I
don't need to you know so I hope you
guys enjoyed if this get ready with me
thumbs up for fall makeup or if you guys
want to see that fall haul let me know
all the things that I've talked about in
this video will be listed down below if
I can find the links and other than that
I love you guys zoom in the back and I
will see that all in my next video bye
guys
funky things and the fire and on the
burner Maya we don't get anymore
