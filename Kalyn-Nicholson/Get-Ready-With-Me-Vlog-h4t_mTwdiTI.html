bar is where I go see my princess and
people do welcome back to my channel for
today's video I figured I would do a get
ready with me
chitchat because I haven't done that and
so long and I had to get ready today and
I didn't feel like doing it alone and I
wanted to talk to you guys so I have to
head out I'm going actually to do some
work at Starbucks and then I'm going to
meet up with a friend after for some
coffee so I figured I would do a little
get ready with me date makeup this is
makeup you could do for date night or a
day date very versatile this is also
just really cute everyday makeup so this
has been like my go-to makeup look and I
go to like outfit idea or even just like
going out for drinks and stuff with
friends jump in shall we
lutely has been having that overwhelming
urge to chop all my hair off
I'm not going to don't worry and I feel
like a full-time thing where I like
travel my hair off you know what I'm
gonna make myself a coffee okay so I'm
starting my just putting some
moisturizer on my skin this is like a
habit but I've recently gotten into and
it changes life I swear now since winter
and it's so cold I don't really do this
as much in the summer I grow business I
need to take care of real quick got to
death sounding is like Joey Alyssa men
died recently aware there was like a
makeup artist to who talked about to did
like makeup for Beyonce and stuff like
that and he was talking about how like
it's good to not be able to see the
foundation on your skin ever since you
said that I'll notice when I'm doing my
makeup is my foundation seems super
cakey and sick for brows I'm going in
with the usual Tarte Amazonian clay and
using the color taupe
I'm a degree D - so next time I can with
this palette here I'm useless before and
videos you guys that this has been like
my all-time favorite palette since the
day we met to face is gingerbread
cookies part of their like holiday
season so I'm starting it with a bottom
color to your gingerbread so I'm just
taking a spill spots Anjali literally
got this from Walmart in put three
dollars I'm just taking this into my
crease and I'm going to like build it up
now just going back into the gingerbread
latte a ginger cream it's super good for
highlighting because super pigmented way
more pigmented than the color that I
just put on my lid in the hot bowl of
interest from Innova concealer I'm going
in with my Born This Way naturally green
concealer and the color fair
and the nice thing about doing your
concealer after your eyeshadows you can
clean up the edges like cleaning up the
massive mess that is me trying to do
please makeup I can we can we restore
became with the window on my birthday
you or me is pretty for last my eyeliner
there's this new thing I've been doing
where I really only put it on the
outside corner I just find it really
opens up the front part of your eyelid
then again I am no makeup artist or
makeup expert so so that's again like
who you want your dog and welcome me for
somebody like me coming up on Monday May
3 laughs will not be enough on Molly
like I said you can obviously darken up
this eyeless by adding more to it as for
like highlighting and contouring just
like he was just talking about how we
all got ennoble so accustomed to over
baking our faces that it just doesn't
even look natural anymore
so I've gone back to using the Too Faced
milk chocolate selects this shadow
contour just looks so much better
especially for like a date night and
then again it also depends on with date
you're going on like you're going for
coffee definitely do more subtle though
if you're going out for like a fancy
dinners and concave crappy to your face
to top off the makeup look I want to
keep my lipstick on like all freaking
day
so I'm going in on top of my lipstick
with this matte liquid lipstick by Kylie
so the guys are wanting what lipstick I
used it was my go-to by bite cashew and
then I'm going on top of it with Kandy K
by
we would say an impacted together with
definitely more like a coffee date
casualty times date outfit I just paired
this silk tank top from Wilfred with
these pant comes and is super comfy but
it let's say you're going to a date
later on the night all I'm going to do
is switch my jacket out for either a
long black jacket that is from H&amp;amp;M or my
go to leather jacket and then switch the
shoes of for three fields and then it's
perfect for Lizzy dinner date so that
was it for my get Betty with me chitchat
you don't owe me didn't want to get
ready or like chitchat or anything like
that thumbs up or let me know down below
