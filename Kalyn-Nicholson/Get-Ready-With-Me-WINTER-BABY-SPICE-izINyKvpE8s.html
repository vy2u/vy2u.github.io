my channel for today's video it is the
seventh day of Christmas I believe and I
wonder doing a get ready with me I
haven't done it get ready with me since
you Tober it's been a while today I was
feeling I don't know if it's just
because excuse me want to eat my armpit
I don't know if it was because this
morning I was reading my weekly
horoscope or if it was just the fact in
general I've been feeling like pastel
E's and pinks and stuff lately but I was
feeling like I wanted to channel like a
girly look today I just wanted something
like very frosted and wintery but like
kind of pink and somehow I turned into
baby spice by the end of it as a quick
disclaimer get ready with me videos are
never about me trying to share my makeup
skills because they do not exist do you
ever just like get ready with your
friends and you're just like listening
to music and talking about life while
you just like pound your face that is
why I love it and get ready with me
videos so with that said we're gonna
talk everything from podcasts to New
Year's goals and some things that I'm
gonna be doing in the new year and
they're testing my fire alarm today so
it keeps going on basically life tracks
and I'm trying to bunch of new products
today too because I'm in the need of
like switching up my makeup routine so
with that said if you guys want to get
ready with me today and just have some
life chats then grab a coffee and just
keep watching guys I feel like I need to
show you my outfit because I'm really
proud of it if you guys watch my LA blog
you'll know that I got this shirt in LA
it's like a friend's sweater from Urban
Outfitters some wearing that with
leggings which is not important but
yesterday I got new slippers and they
match this sweater
almost two months like how perfect is
this outfit and these like sock like
slippers can we just this is like this
is the worst outfit of the day ever I'm
like doing squats someone wrote on my
apartments or being like do you not feel
like people can see you when you're
sitting in your room and I'm like yeah
actually I do
cuz like there's an apartment building
right there in an apartment building
right there I can obviously see me
talking to myself on camera with dog
ears on but that's okay I'm like I'm
feeling like I want to do a very wintry
frosty look it's very cold and miserable
outside and so I'm feeling very at
frosted frozen plus I just got my hair
done and she did such a wicked job on my
roots and like lightened everything up
it's actually dope too because I have a
bunch of new makeup products that I
wanted to try I don't want to use my new
speakers so I
went to my first Monica dinner we did
this mystery menorah kinda like Secret
Santa and Greg's dad got me one of the
Google mini homes which is actually it's
so funny because I was just thinking the
other day of having such a first-world
thought where I was like I want to have
a speaker in both rooms that way I don't
have to constantly move it this is look
at first impressions on many things oh
this is so cute look at how many it is I
love that were five minutes into this
and I still haven't even started my
makeup yet bear with me guys we all know
you don't watch me for my makeup skills
why I send you my film by the way that
mic is on mute Mike's back on you may
have to download apps for things in the
meantime let's begin one of the things
that I actually wanted to try today is a
new primer so bare minerals good
hydrations
silky face primers this is what it looks
like I've never tried it before so this
ends up being a good primer then this
might be a new stapler
no he's here what do we what what should
we name him I feel like I like something
like Ollie like hey ollie
play my music
cool so new product I also want to try
out the bare minerals foundations so I
need to figure out what color I'm gonna
be my foundation actually recently ran
out and when I was in LA I just ran and
grabbed I'll usually use elf it's not
the best foundation but you're also
spending like like five I think was like
five or ten bucks on it so but I do need
a new like higher-end foundation so I'm
gonna try this one out I've never tried
the bare minerals before but we're gonna
give it a go it's the bare minerals bare
Pro and I'm gonna try golden nude Oh
playing some music on google play music
also if you guys are curious I just
posted a new playlist
it's called mellow morning that's what
I'm gonna be listening to in between
sometimes so I actually really really
like this I feel like it's not too heavy
it covered up my pimples literally all I
could ask for ever since I watched the
holiday last night I've been wanting to
just like speak in a British accent I
forgot how good that movie is because
we're looking for another Christmas
movie to watch watch the holiday it's
with Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet but I
completely forgot it existed and they
saw it on Netflix
I am literally like my spirit animal is
Cameron Diaz in that movie
okay so next I'm going to be trying a
new concealer as well it is the Marcel
flawless skin fusion at concealer this
might be my new concealer I've actually
just ran out of K I've ran out of almost
everything which is why we're trying
only products in this video I feel like
I have to make the disclaimer like this
video is not sponsored I really just
wanted to try all these new products the
nice thing about Marcel too is you can
get at drugstores so it's not like
ridiculously overpriced okay so next I
might try the Born This Way after all
setting powder so I'm gonna set my face
with this again I'm out of setting
powder so this works out nicely and I'm
always I've always been a huge fantasy
face
so I decided to do straight brows today
will look more straight than I usually
do so we try new things while we talk
about new things and sometimes I have a
coffee I feel like I feel like I should
have a coffee right now so many
interruptions much better this is the
new mug cat got me for Christmas how
cute all right straight brows check good
playlist check I've been literally
uploading new playlists like pretty much
every Monday find every time I tweet my
playlist so you lose a bunch of
followers which is low-key very
upsetting but if you guys are curious
I've pretty much post a new playlist on
Spotify every single Monday for
eyeshadow I'm trying a new palette this
is love game by NARS so it's gonna be
blind date your move and then momentum
and I'm sorry I was just giving you a
finger
so I am gonna put false lashes on today
but while I let my mascara dry I'm going
to contour I don't think I have oh I
don't have a new contour thing they are
Pro contour face shaping powder trio the
inside has a shade blend and a pop okay
this shade color is amazing
impossible I'm also gonna try the pop
color underneath my eyes let's see how
that works
oh no that's great this is not a brush
meant for this but we're making it for
it
really Bentley let's get rid of my dark
circles like it look like I just slept
today's been a good day for new products
don't really think you know everything's
looking the only thing is that I wanted
it to be a bit more like pastel II so I
think I'm gonna go back into the Too
Faced glitter palette I originally used
fairy dust which is this one up here but
I might try a little bit of this one
just add a bit more pink
so I'm going to stick on some watches
today I'm doing the Mamas no mama mamas
nose Jesus I cannot talk today today I'm
using the mama knows best and I'm gonna
put those on also if you guys are
following me on Twitter Instagram you
might already know this but I've been
doing so much research this week on
podcasts because I feel like I want to
turn coffee talks into a podcast for
2018 there's so many new like goals and
stuff that I've set for 2018 already
that I'm so excited about the other
thing that I've been working on and I
didn't really want to tell you guys but
I can't keep the secret because it's
like all I think about my spare time is
I've been working really hard at getting
tree Capture finished it's taking me a
while because rounds and rounds of
proofreading I'm getting my friends to
proofread I think I'm just gonna self
publish it like print it out myself get
physical copies of it and then just sell
them on COEs it's just like one of those
things that I can't seem to let like I
just need to perfect it before I release
it but that's the other thing I'm
working on for 2018 so many things going
on and I just planned my schedule last
night so I gave myself like Christmas
Day and a couple days after Christmas
off before I have to start pre filming
for January so it's gonna be super
exciting and nice but I am so excited
for the new year I'm so excited for like
resolutions I'm so excited for my plan
with me video for New Year's there's so
many good videos that I already have
scheduled in January we have so many
things happening in 2018 guys I'm so
excited
it's gonna be good eat
now I'm going to go into the
amuse-bouche liquefied lipsticks these
are by bite I just got these and I
wanted to give them a go and caramelize
my work quick I feel like whips gonna be
the one so I'll give you guys some
swatches this is for whip as I feel so
professional look at these like look at
me swatching that might be the winner so
then this is caramelized I feel like I'm
gonna do whip only because it's a bit
pinky I actually really like this color
and I love bite the only only thing I'm
gonna say about it is that it kind of
smells / tastes a little funny but aside
from that pretty wicked color so this is
really close to what I was gonna
picturing to finish it all off I'm going
to set my face with the hangover 3 &amp;amp; 1
by Too Faced it's a primer setter and
refresher oh that smells really good Oh
smells like coconut so that completes ed
the makeup look of this get ready with
me now I'm gonna do my hair I'm thinking
I want to do just like big curls on the
bottom but leave the top kind of as is
currently growing my bangs back out so I
don't think I'll be rocking the bangs
today I'm gonna curl my hair with a two
inch curling wand and I start from here
down I curl everything from the chin
below and I curl everything away from my
face you guys have seen me curl my hair
a million times so to save you the
boredom I'm just gonna go ahead and see
save do you guys a lot of time mini
elastics ready to go feeling like I want
to be a unicorn today I mean I feel like
I kind of want to be a unicorn everyday
but specifically today
feel like I'm rocking some very serious
baby spice vibes right now oh my like it
I am digging this look today so
realistically my outfit today is
probably gonna stay the same I threw my
slippers in the wash so they should be
done pretty soon probably gonna wear my
friends sweater and my slippers just
while I edit today's video and get those
things done but then when I go out later
tonight
I only has a bat appointment I have to
go to the grocery store I should have
like a bunch of running around might try
and do some Christmas shopping tonight
too
I'm gonna switch my outfit and in that
case I'll probably end up wearing some
distressed jeans a cropped like knit
sweater the crominus sweater that I got
recently it is from Urban Outfitters as
well it is so comfy it's almost got like
a velvety feel to it and then some black
biddies that'll probably be my outfit
when I actually have to go exist in the
real world so aside from that I hope you
