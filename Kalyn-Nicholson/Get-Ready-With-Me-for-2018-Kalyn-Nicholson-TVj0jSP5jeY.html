child is flat young we turn to make
goodnight push problems and welcome back
to my channel for today's video I'm
vlogging with you guys again if you
can't already tell
today is December 28 I woke up this
morning around 7 and I've just been like
playing on the computer if I'm being
honest with you I made myself a coffee
and the Pisces mug that my brother got
me for Christmas I'm also wearing when
you workout gear that I showed you guys
oh my what I got for Christmas video too
so I'm about to go for a run downstairs
in the gym the whole premise of today's
vlog is I'm going to be prepping for the
next two days like basically cleaning my
slate and getting completely ready to
just like go into the new year 100%
prepared look like you know how Sunday's
are just days in order to get your
together for like the following week the
next two days aka this whole vlog is
gonna be me justing for 2018 organizing
gutting my apartment cleaning it all out
the other day before I left for
Christmas I wrote down all of the things
I wanted to do to get ready for the new
year and the last night / this morning I
was planning at all in this which I also
showed you guys in my wine i got for
christmas i got this from urban
outfitters and i think i'm gonna use
these on days that i'm filming so i
already woke up this morning and walked
Bentley so next on the list is working
out which to be honest with you guys
like i don't know why but I've been
having like I have had such a headache
for the past three days I'm not like a
hundred percent excited to go for a ride
but I just I wanna just like get it done
over with and then maybe I'll feel
better one of the other things I'm gonna
be doing this vlog is writing down with
my fitness plan for 2018 as well which
is why I can't ditch today's workout
right off workouts and now I can't now I
can't go back I'm gonna go grab my
headphones and just pump out a really
quick like 30
so it is now it's actually getting post
to 11:30 my day is going a little slower
than I thought it was going to today but
that's okay because in all reality I'm
on my own schedule so I'm just gonna
take a look at what exactly I had
planned for today's New Year pep and one
exactly I planned for tomorrow because
there is quite a few things to do I want
to write out my fitness plan deep-clean
my apartment which is going to include
doing laundry recycling taking down the
Christmas tree and all the Christmas
decorations just like low-key kind of
sad but it means that I also get to get
a few things for the new year which I'm
a little excited about you know this
room which is my closet slash office
room this place is a pigsty I really
want to organize it if I have enough
time while I got everything and I'm
cleaning everything I'm going to also
make donations piles and if there's
anything that I think of like any ideas
of like little things that I want to
change in terms of decor for the new
year then I'm gonna just like write it
down on it to by list and then I do need
to go grab groceries as well things
could get old lady crazy up in here
tomorrow is a lot more of the planning
organizing I'm gonna go out we're gonna
go shopping and get stuff I think I want
to write out my fitness plan especially
since I just made myself a coffee so I'm
gonna sit on this bad boy and write up
just like a mini plan for the new year
food or meal plans that I sort of want
to stick by money that I want to spend
on groceries some workout ideas days
that I want to work out and then after
that we're gonna get a lot of candela up
in here and clean the crew rather this
place
it's going on six o'clock I just made
myself some dinner I went and grabbed
groceries I made myself a turkey like a
tofu turkey sandwich on an onion bun
with homemade french fries Rajaraja the
amazing oh hello the only things that I
didn't get to we're taking down the
Christmas tree because I want to buy
like a tub to put on my Christmas stuff
in so I might wait to do that tomorrow I
did take the Christmas stuff out of my
bedroom and I have one load left of
laundry and that I have no laundry in my
hamper like at all
all my towels are clean linens are clean
all the stuff off my bed I put my
mattress topper on that I got for
Christmas and oh my god it is so freakin
comfy and then last but not least i
still need to organize my closet room on
my workout gear the only thing is greg
just told me that he's actually really
really sick right now so i think what
i'm gonna do is push all that to
tomorrow and go and head over there and
just like i don't know what like take
care of him because i feel bad that he's
sick he's been like throwing up and
stuff so today has to be cut a little
short and tomorrow's gonna be a bit more
heavy but that's okay cuz i don't know
any plans tomorrow night regardless of
it being a friday instead i'll be able
to get it all done and tomorrow that's
currently the update so I'm gonna eat my
tofurkey sandwich on the menu but I'm
TVs having a friend's marathon so that's
what I'm gonna watch and then go grab
some banana popsicles and some stuff to
bring Greg and I'll talk to you guys in
well probably just a few seconds but for
me in a few hours actually
I love making food at home why don't why
do I ever get takeout well aware that my
face is a little bit drought drought
feature but we're working with it I just
got back from Greg's house I made myself
a coffee he was so sick I feel so bad
for him so to start out my day I'm just
you know sipping on this coffee when we
get ready soon and then we're gonna hit
them all actually really excited there
are certain things that I'm getting on
this list that have been needed for the
whole year and I just completely put it
off like bowls like guys I actually do
not have normal kitchen bowls outside it
is a blizzard right now like it is crazy
so it should be an interesting adventure
I'm hoping it doesn't take
too long can't really complain today
still pretty cool
that didn't end up taking me longer than
I thought
it was like a three and a half hour trip
to the mall really quick I'm gonna share
with you guys that stuff that I got from
Moloch the bin itself is actually from
Canadian Tire so this is gonna be the
bin that I put on my christmas stuff in
okay so they didn't have all of the
utensils in stock but I did picked up
what they did have and which was a knife
set and a little mini spoon set so I
basically am going to slowly move all of
my utensils into Blacky tencel's and I
got these like moe I don't even know
what like they're almost like a dusty
pink pillowcase so I got two of those
pillowcases my cutting board recently
broke so I picked up two new cutting
boards I picked up a black one and a
wooden one both of these are actually
from hmmoh nice home stuff is really
good and then I also picked up just
curtains the same color I think these
might go on my living room I'm just
gonna put them beside the white sheers
because two of them are really dirty
that is the curtains that I got oh
you're gonna notice the kind of color
scheme that I'm going for really quick
the next thing I purchased they had a
bunch of their candles on sale so I
picked up the cherry tree one like I
told you guys I needed bowls to that I
had two of them I'm gonna have to order
it online cuz they didn't have the black
ones but they did up the gray so what I
ended up doing is I mixed them match and
everything so I grabbed it two of the
dark gray balls four of the big plates
but I got the black ones and then I
grabbed four of the little plates but at
the great one basically gonna be a
mix-and-match you know you're getting
old when you're excited about the plates
and bowls that you bought I'm like you
just like shove stuff in there and you
just slap it also going to be key
because we're heading up to Gregg's
cottage for New Year's Eve and maybe
I'll make salsa with it you know in
terms of pillows I ended up picking
three and new little baby like
pillowcases to swatch out for my couch
so I got this one it's like a little
fake for white one this one which fits
that like dusty pink color I don't even
know what to call this it's like a mole
and then
laughs one that I picked up was this one
so those are the pillows that I grabbed
and then the last thing that I picked up
from a chat and probably my favorite
thing I picked up this little hand and
it's a candle holder and then I picked
up four like gold candles to go inside
and I just think this is so cool but I
also picked up new wine glasses because
a bunch of mine have broke and I kind of
like the ones that don't have a stem
mask like that's perfect
at least just a little Brita filter so
because it's pretty much between
Christmas and New Year's a bunch of the
Boxing Day sales sales are still on so I
picked up two new pairs of reading socks
from indigo I got baby pink and gray
which also I just realized matches
everything else that I bought and then
what I initially went for is something
that you guys are going to see in
tomorrow's video but in my prep for 2018
I wanted to pick up a new journal
because I like to have a new journal for
every year is the Classic Collection
ruled notebook it's in and again that
kind of like purpley dusty rose color
and I'm gonna DIY this in tomorrow's
video with you guys so that is the
journal that I picked up from Bath and
Body Works guys Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is
having the most insane sale right now
it's got two new soaps for my bathrooms
the first one I picked up was winter
white but this one smells really really
good kind of smells a bit a little bit
like flannel mixed with marshmallow
fireside and then the other one I picked
up with cinnamon caramel swirl and the
hands ups were all on for $3.75 and then
I also bought a bunch of their little
centers because these were also on sale
for $3 and this is the other center that
I got my other bathroom and then found a
Victoria Secret really quick they were
having their semi annual sales
first things first my makeup bag broke
on the handle on top of my old makeup
bag just like snapped so I picked up a
new one especially with all the
traveling I have coming through 2018 I
needed a new one of these so the bigger
one I think I'm going to use for my
makeup and then the smaller one only
used
Russia's next I wasn't even gonna get
this I was just about to put it back
down before I realized it was on sale it
is just this zip up sweater here super
cute
yeah I mean not much more to say about
it especially when I run outside and I'm
layering up or just in general on like
lazy days whatever driving the Kingston
and back just like easy zip up sweaters
so you're not like too overdressed
I went and picked up a pair of the
slippers because I have to put my
naughty and nice livers away which is
sort of sad so you pair with the little
pom-poms on them like how freaking cute
are these right right the last thing I
did get was a new again we're gonna have
to I'm tucking away the red robe until
next holidays so I picked up again in
the same color of like everything else
that's in this hall I picked up this
little kimono it's like the same dusty
apparently if this is like the color of
2018 is gonna be my color that was a
good shopping trip as part is I thought
I was using that Christmas money and
gift cards so I literally didn't spend
any money at all first things first
we're gonna take down all the Christmas
stuff and then we'll move into the
closet I Love New Year prep make a shirt
that just says I am on a cadaver you
know is me
I've been spending enough time couple
women by my side I'll go to sitting on
my mind spend on bread wine
I've been sitting never ages ripping out
the pages how'd I get so faded how'd I
get so faded
only now if you love me how did you
never
the crimson
I wanna to get free money
this is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my
bloodstream fading out
a few chemicals burned in my bloodstream
so tell me let it kick fit
I've been looking for love thought I'd
finally win a boat oh god make me
another one I'll be feeling this
tomorrow Lord forgive me for the things
I've done I was never meant for no one
okay first of all can we just take a
moment to like bask in this I am
obsessed with the changes that I just
made like everything has just like the
tiniest pop of pink it's so glorious I'm
using my new like bowls and plates I
have my new wine glass for dinner
everything ended up so cute I'll take a
daytime shopper you guys and insert it
here so you guys can see what everything
looks like once the daytime comes and
now I'm just sitting down to eat dinner
and made myself the same turkey sandwich
that I made myself last night only this
time I put roasted mushrooms on it made
myself the same potato and I made myself
a salad with like those crunchy like
tortilla things on top because I didn't
end up getting to the gym I think I'm
just gonna workout tomorrow morning with
just totally fine my closet it's like
the last and final thing that I need to
do to prep for the new year so I think
I'm just gonna hit the gym in the
morning which means I'm just going to
eat dinner and bask in the friends
marathon that's on MTV I'd surely get my
apartment has a whole new feel to it and
a whole new vibe and I don't know why
but I've just been so drawn to like baby
Pink's baby blues like really pastel
colors and like whites and grays that's
just the color that 2018 is screaming to
me right now so I'm really happy with
all the changes this was all working out
quite nicely
can you stop begging for my potatoes or
my potatoes I don't share potatoes
that's our skies
kids are
that's our skies
subscribe
I have other things that I need to
finish this vlog off it is now
officially the next day it's the day
before New Year's Eve and I am finally
feeling that like completely prepped and
ready to go into the new year we're
actually leaving tonight to go to Greg's
cottage The Slap Chop that I bought
yesterday I'm gonna make bruschetta
finish this DIY and basically what I did
is I just printed off like a bunch of
photos from the year that I really
enjoyed I'm a big believer in the like
law of attraction and that putting the
things that you want to attract into
your life around you on a regular basis
and somewhere you're gonna see it all
the time just works little wonders so
for instance like I know that I want to
buy a condo this year so I put up
pictures of kind of what I want the
condo to look like but aside from that
everything else is just more like moods
vibes or just like good memories that I
had from 2017 I printed off some photos
with Mike's my friends some photos with
Greg I even got a photo with Bentley and
I from back in January when we made a
fort that just spark any sort of joy
every time you see them kind of like the
mood that I'm feeling for 2018 the kind
of things that I want to do like there
are some CO stuff in here and just like
I put all the elements because I'm super
hippie lame like that like I put fire
air earth and water on here just little
things like that just things that I want
to carry into the new year and it'll
just be there to like you know like a
little visual inspiration anytime I need
it when I'm working also for those of
you guys that are curious about the
workout plan that I wrote up earlier I
went for a run this morning and as I was
running I was like I totally I totally
didn't talk about it put on one side
more like exercise based things and the
other side more health and like meal
based things so my workout plan for
January is that I want to work out five
days a week which is more relatively
Monday to Friday
every time I workout I'm gonna give
myself a five-dollar tally this is super
lame but that said I feel like it's a
good mind trick so every single time
that I workout I get a five dollar tally
and I'm just gonna keep a tally in my
agenda and then at the end of the week
that gives me $25 that money gets to go
back into buying like either workout
gear exercise clothes or just like
little things that I want to buy for
myself that way it doesn't feel like
selfish spending you know what I'm
saying because I'm trying to save money
I don't know I kind of like even just
redoing my apartment I feel like a whole
new spark of energy
so I think that buying and replacing
things as long as you're donating your
old things isn't necessarily a bad thing
but I want to work for it so that I
don't feel like I'm going over the top
with it and then any extra workouts like
let's say on Saturday or Sunday I go for
a hike or k2 yoga class or something um
extra workouts are $10 low bonus workout
it's like you you went above and beyond
this week so here's ten bucks so that's
gonna be like my incentive to workout
and then just some goals that I have for
working out I want to do yoga at least
once a week I've been really getting
back into doing yoga whether it's hot
yoga or just every day after my runs
I've been just kind of going off to the
side and doing my own like 15 minute
really quick like flow I don't know why
I'm just feeling so drawn to yoga lately
my like health side of things obviously
I want to eat vegan I'm gonna have one
grocery day a week where I make sure
like a meal plan for the whole week it's
not I don't necessarily have to meal
prep but I just have to decide what I'm
gonna be eating all my meals and then
just pick it all up in one go that way
I'm not tempted and if I do that then
Sunday's get to be my takeout date I've
also been getting really into cooking
lately so I'm gonna start posting more
vegan recipes to my blog and then I want
to start getting into smoothies and
juicing again I did I left my juicer
back in Kingston but I have a juicer
that I'm gonna start using drink more
water eat more Whole Foods and meditate
more often at least five to ten minutes
a day sometimes I could just be
listening to music it could be going for
a walk whatever it is just that chunk of
time to kind of do a little bit of like
soul therapy or mind therapy if that
makes sense so yeah that's kind of my
workout plan we're not gonna say for the
whole year because I'm I change I
changed my moods and I changed my plans
like all the time so thus concludes this
little prepping for the New Year vlog I
hope you guys in joyed 2017 it was
actually a such an amazing year this
time tomorrow I'll be on my way up to
Toronto
yeah myself and now to brown to the
artist go home
so I've officially been in my brand-new
for a week
I like this about us I always think I
look cute that I don't
my dog is the president my friend is the
first lady
maybe only just
crazy crazy
this year I moved to Toronto I got to
travel to so many new places I got to go
to Coachella I met Greg this year and we
made a bunch of memories together
including even just taking him to the
east coast where my family's from I
wrote my first ebook I like it just this
year was more than I could have ever
asked for and I'm feeling so content
going into 2018 I feel like 2018 is
going to be fricking magical like
Hogwarts you know getting I'll hang
up my name dream board chill in my pink
bubble of an apartment out and packed
for the college so thank you guys so
much for watching I feel like our little
online family / crew has grown so much
more bonded this year and I'm just so
excited - I don't even know I'm just so
excited to see what 2018 is gonna bring
us guys I feel like it's gonna be some
good stuff but we will only know when it
happens only I don't know what life
would be like if it weren't for this
little Internet crew we've created but
there's definitely no other people that
I'd rather share life with so with that
videos will now be going live every
Sunday and Monday which means yes
there's gonna be a new video the very
first day of 2018 I hope you guys all
have an amazing new year and an even
better 2018 and with that we will see
