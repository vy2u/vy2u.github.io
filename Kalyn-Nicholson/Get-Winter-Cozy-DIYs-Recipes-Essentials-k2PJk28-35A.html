sorry
hey guys so for today's video I am doing
like a cozy winter video if any of you
guys are like me and you're a little bit
higher up north it starts to get cold
relatively early I mean we've been
blessed recently with kind of warmer
weather but I don't live in it it gets
cold I like to get cozy so I decided to
do like a cozy winter video and just do
some like DIY decor as well as just
other decor that I picked up from just
like stores and stuff that just like a
little mini refresher of my room to get
it ready for kind of like winter and
Christmas and stuff and as well as just
some like really really fun and cozy
essentials that I have and two recipes
that are two of my favorites for when it
gets nice and cold outside and they'll
keep you warm so most of these DIYs are
from the dollar stores so they're super
cheap and easy to do so you can do them
even if you're on like a college budget
or whatever I pretty much picked up
everything from the dollar store so it's
easily accessible if your room look
extra cozy food winter or your dorm or
your apartment or your house you guys
wanna see how I get cozy for the
wintertime then just keep watching so
for starters I wanted to make my room a
little bit more winter cozy so I swapped
out some of the decor pieces for more
wintry ones and I'll leave on the screen
where they're from but I just wanted to
give my room more of like a winter
caveny type of feel as well as at indigo
I found this little grow your own
Christmas tree and I thought it was
perfect for this little video so I am
growing my own Christmas tree fun fact
but I am growing it and I'm going to be
vlogging it's process if it ever decides
to grow so be sure to follow my blog
channel if you guys want to see it but
yeah I'm growing my own little mini
Christmas tree and then as for
essentials for getting cozy this winter
I like candles my two recent favorites
are salted caramel and cozy cabin from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works as well as just like
plaid pajamas shorts are like my go-to
in the winter time because I hate pajama
pants or sleeping in them as well as
just a really good winter playlist and
I'll leave my most recent one down below
but I love just having good music for
the winter time and then as for DIYs I
made this little pinecone
it was super easy and everything was
from the dollar store so I got this
little wreath from the Dollar Rama if
you're Canadian you'll be able to find
all of these things super easy and then
just these little bags of frosted
pinecones and all I'm doing is plugging
in a hot iron or a hot glue gun sorry
and just hot gluing the pinecones
into the wreath and going all the way
around one layer and then doing the
second layer on top and you could even
do a third layer if you want but I
thought that it would be too many
pinecones so that is what I did to kind
of get the pinecone look
then to finish off the wreath I just
took a little bit of white ribbon and
I'm tying a little bow and then I'm just
gonna hot glue that you could hot glue
to the top in the middle or at the
bottom like I decided to do and you
could make this little bow red you can
do any color you like but I wanted to
keep the little white theme I hope going
so I'm just hot gluing the bow onto the
wreath and then that is it I'm going to
hang it up on my bedroom door and that
is all you have to do for this like
cabin ish pinecone wreath
and of course nothing gives a room a
more cozy feel than string lights so I
bought these little bulbs from Walmart
and I'm taking three different kinds of
ribbon you could choose any colors that
are gonna match your room but I decided
to go with silver white and red and I'm
doing little bows or tying little knots
on each of these sections but in between
all of the bulbs and I'm doing it in the
pattern of going silver red white silver
red white this is so easy to do it's
super affordable and it kind of just
adds a little bit more color or more
like festiveness to it your lights
in oh you're so dramatic and then you
can actually hang these up anywhere I
decided to put them over my bed that you
could stream these by your window you
could string it by your TV you could
stream this anywhere in your house or in
your room and it just adds the perfect
amount of cozy lighting with a little
bit of festive color so next I've
decided to show you guys how I make my
phone or just like this noodle soup
I got requested for the recipe on my
blog so I'm gonna put it in this video
because it's a super cozy recipe so
you're just gonna need a little bit of
vegetable broth and by a little bit I
mean a whole box so I'm just putting the
whole box of vegetable broth into a pot
and then adding a bit of soya sauce it
depends on how much you like soy sauce
taste but I added a little decent amount
and then I'm just crushing up some fresh
mushrooms into the broth but again you
can add any vegetables that you guys
like into this and then I'm just going
to bring that to a boil and add some
rice noodles in and I only use about
half a pack to make two bowls so and
then when it's it's done I'm going to be
putting some bean sprouts some green
onion and some fresh cilantro in so you
just want to bring it to a boil add a
little bit of salt and pepper and then
just keep mixing until it's cooked
then you just go ahead and add the
noodles in the broth to the bowl and
then I'm putting some fresh bean sprouts
on top as well as a little bit of green
onion which is my favorite and cilantro
and that completes the whole thing and
again you guys could add any toppings or
any vegetables that you want but this is
just the way that I do it and it's one
of my favorite recipes lately and I've
been making it so much because it's so
easy and so warm and so good so as for
above my desk you guys know I have these
pictures up and I decided to swap some
of them out to give them a little bit
more of a wintry feel there were photos
there at indigo that were like $30.00
and there was no way I was buying or
paying that just for a picture so I
decided to make my own out of gift bags
which just is super easy to do and
really affordable so just get your
favorite Christmassy or your favorite
pattern gift bags and then just go ahead
and cut them out and frame them and it's
a super easy way to make a Christmassy
kind of theme on your wall and really
easy to do and then I actually took the
tag and just put it in the middle for
this one and then put all the stuff back
into the frame and flip it over and
you're ready to go
and then for the next one I got this
plaid gift bag and I'm just using a
little bit of gift wrap that's silver or
you could do it in gold and just free
handing some antlers as you guys know I
love like an antler look and then I'm
just cutting it out and using a little
bit of cement glue to glue it on to the
paper bag itself and then going ahead
and framing that as well and then
another option you could do is just use
a little bit of card stock or thicker
paper and I'm just cutting this out to
fit the frame and then using a little
bit of that gift wrap again to just kind
of draw out a mug and then I'm cutting
the mug out and again cement gluing it
to the card stock and then just using a
little bit of silver paint to kind of
create to be steam coming off the mug
and this is again another really easy
way to make a really cute photo to frame
for a wall
and then last but not least I'm going to
share with you guys my really really
easy simple vegan mocha recipe so all I
do is grab some fresh cocoa and this is
the best way to do it because it's also
the healthiest way to do it and I'm just
adding a really big heaping spoonful
into my coffee and then brewing a cup of
coffee if you guys want it really
chocolaty you can add a little bit more
cocoa than that and then just going
ahead and adding some vanilla almond
milk to make it a little bit more creamy
and some stevia and then you could even
add things like peppermint in there or
you could get really creative with them
but that is just a simple basic mocha
that I make and I've been making it a
lot now that it's starting to get cold
again so I hope you guys enjoyed my cozy
little essentials DIYs as well as just
some recipes to get you guys ready and
cozy for the winter time let me know if
