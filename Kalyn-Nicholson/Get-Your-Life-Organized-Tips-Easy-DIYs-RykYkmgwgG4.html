to be doing some tips and some DIYs for
getting your life organized so I'm
somebody that likes to stay relatively
organized in the sense that I find it
helps a lot with my anxiety but also
just because I find it kind of fun I
guess in a weird way to get organized so
these are just some little things that I
have found have helped me keep my life a
little bit more organized as well as
some fun DIYs that you can put up in
your room or in your apartment or in
your dorm room or in your bedroom
wherever you want but they're just gonna
help you keep on track with things that
you need to get done as well as keep
things organized for yourself I will
also be doing a giveaway in this video
so the giveaway is going to be of you'll
get the little to-do list that I made
and then when you open up the little
to-do list that actually has like the
little checks where you can put the
check marks in the lines where you can
write down your to-do lists every night
you'll also be getting a calendar that
dry race calendar that you can put up on
your wall and write what you need to do
for the month you'll be getting a bunch
of different colored dry erase markers
so that you can color coordinate like I
did and then the other dry erase you'll
be getting is a one you can put beside
the month one and this one is a week one
so you can write down what you need to
do for Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday Sunday and this one has
cute little Clips like appointments
bills shopping and coupons and little
areas of other things you can write as
well as little labels down here that you
can put into different days of the week
so this one's just like a more in-depth
weekly what to do as well as the month
one that you'll get which you can fill
out of things that you need to do
throughout the entire month and along
with that I will be giving away a Genda
just like mine I'm going to basically
choose the winner allow the winner to
send me a bunch of pictures and I will
design an agenda for them and then ship
it out to you and so along with your
agenda you'll be getting a pack of
markers like I used in the video so this
is the little color-coordinated marker
pens that you can use for your agenda as
well as a little pack of ticket notes or
post-it notes so that you can keep
everything organized inside so you'll be
getting that along with a $15 Starbucks
gift card and there will also be a
second prize winner
so these second prize
we'll also be getting a little dry erase
board this one is just clear so they can
write maybe a list of things they need
to do throughout the month their goals
for the month whatever it is you'll be
getting this one here as well as the
agenda that you will be able to design
and I will send out to you some marker
pens for your agenda as well as some
post-it notes for your agenda those will
be the two giveaways to find out how to
enter just check the description box
down below and other than that keep
watching for some tips and DIYs for
getting your life organized
did you see my first tip and one of the
most important is to choose a certain
amount of years and make your goals for
that certain amount so I chose five
years and I wrote down things I want to
have accomplished by this next five
years so that no matter what at the end
of the day I can ask myself if I've done
something to get closer to those goals
another way I like to keep on track is a
little bit more short term I get a
calendar and I put it up on my wall and
it's for the full month and I'll color
code me coordinate sorry things that I
need to do that month whether it's
certain appointments videos I need to
film and then on the side I'll do it to
do lists of things that don't fit in
like doing a channel intro or getting my
taxes done so I like to keep that
organized and just above my desk so I
can always see what I need to be doing
that day and then even more short term I
love to use my agenda this thing is like
my lifesaver so I'll flip to the week
that it currently is and write a little
bit more in depth and I'll also write
things like what I want to do for
working out that week which days I'm
going to be going out for lunch and
stuff like that
and I also like to use post-it notes for
things that might not stay the same so I
can flip them around and my agenda
itself I'll leave a link to down below
but I designed the front and back on a
certain website I'll leave it down below
for you guys and I love it because you
can completely personalize the entire
inside and outside and choose everything
and if agendas aren't so much your
saying you could easily just write to-do
lists at the end of the night I'd like
to just sit down and write down the
things that I need to do usually it is
in my agenda but if you don't have one
just grab a piece of paper or a notebook
and write down all the things you need
to do the following day so that you can
go to sleep with your mind at ease and
then you can just talk it up anywhere
that you're gonna see it the next day
and then once the following day comes
you can wake up grab your to-do list and
get started right away
and if you don't really have a place on
your wall to tack up really important
papers this is a cute little DIY you can
do that looks very decorative but it's
also really really efficient so just
take little pieces of tape and mask out
little designs that you want to do I
mean you could even do full-out stencils
with this you could get really creative
and then just pick some of your favorite
colors and paint on the little cork
board so that you have cute little
designs so that it's not just a boring
old brown cork board
the best part about this DIY is you can
get really creative with the different
designs and colors that you want to do
and really make it personalized for your
room
and if you're someone that doesn't
necessarily want or like to paint you
could just use pretty decorative tape
like this this is some scotch tape but
you could also use like washi tape or
whatever that stuff is called and just
get stuff that's really decorative and
tape it onto the board just so that it
looks prettier once you hang it up on
your wall and once then you can tack up
important things that you can't forget
or papers that are super important and
if you don't want to hang up certain
papers on your wall another thing I like
to do is get a little file quarter to
put in receipts or my passport or just
papers that I cannot lose it's a really
easy place to keep things and you always
know where your important papers are
another really easy tip is to declutter
and get rid of things you don't need
whether you're donating it to like
goodwill or to charity or if you're just
giving it away to some friends then just
declutter and anything that you don't
use or need anymore get rid of it the
less the better
and if you're finding that you seem
constantly broke another really
important tip to getting organized in
your life is creating yourself a little
budget whether you do this on a notepad
or on the computer just write down the
amount of income you have coming in
whether you work a job or if you get an
allowance and then write down all the
expenses that you need to pay so rent
following groceries your car whatever it
is you own and then max that out as to
what it comes as to total then put a
little bit of money into savings and the
rest is just some extra expenses that
you can use for experiences like going
to the movies or going out for lunch
with your friends and that way you have
a budget that you know you can't go over
for the full month and it just keeps you
a little bit more organized with your
money
and if you really want to get crafty you
could make little DIY chalkboards for
your room your kitchen your apartment
wherever it is so I just grab these
little wood canvases but you could do
this on frames on mirrors you can do
this on so many different things and
then just some chalkboard paint or if
you can't find any chalkboard paint I
just use some matte satin black spray
paint and just spray paint your frames
or your wooden canvasses and then using
some chalk or you can use these chalk
markers like I used I just mopped out
little things like what we were going to
eat for the whole week so that we have
it all planned out or you could write
your grocery list you could really get
creative with this one or even use it
just as your to-do list and wash it down
every night and then my last tip is just
to take 15 minutes out of every single
day to just do a little quick cleanup of
your area whether you're it's just your
bedroom your dorm room your a full
apartment wherever it is taking just 15
minutes to just quickly clean up will
monk a world of a difference and keep
things more clean and organized overall
we had people so email into the water
so those are all of my tips and little
DIYs for ways to get your life a bit
more organized all the links I talked
about will be down below as well as the
giveaway rules don't forget about that
and I will see you guys all in a future
