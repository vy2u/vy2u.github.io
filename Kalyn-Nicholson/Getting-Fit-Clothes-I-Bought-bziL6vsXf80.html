blogged in so long
this just feels so foreign to me right
now I just recently got ready which was
interesting in itself what I do that why
they do that
that damn it and so I am a best to head
to the mall to pick up stuff for soccer
which is another update I have so I
actually signed up for a co-ed soccer
team so I have to go pick up stuff for
that and my first game is actually
tonight
low-key a little bit nervy if I'm being
honest with you guys but just because I
haven't played soccer since I was like
well I have to go get shoes and shin pad
you
you
so I'm officially back in law I'm gonna
show you guys what I got because I ended
up doing some serious damage from battle
- I got a new body lotion I feel weird
with my face not in the frame I got
magic in the air just I ran out of body
lotion so and you know what this one
smells good
real fast bomb because after soccer
tonight I'm gonna have a little bath
because I haven't had one move here and
I also picked up two handles the first
time I got is proper coconut and it's in
like the marble jar and it smell so good
I'm in super obsessed with coconut many
other one that I got it's black teak
wood which kind of smells like mahogany
teak wood if I'm being honest with you
but the jars also just super pretty and
I just burned my mahogany teak wood so
figured I'd try something new then I
went to a ritzy F and I'll show you guys
what I picked appears there's this
donkey on the big picked up a bodysuit
it's just like a red one
I saw someone rocking an outfit with a
red bodysuit the other day like damn I
need a red bodysuit so when I went into
a ritzy and I saw one state next I
picked up this it's like a dress like a
big giant like oversized shirt dress and
I don't know I kind of have like a few
outfit ideas in mind but I also think
it'd be like super comfortable for like
the weekend I'm going to be doing like a
collective haul soon though so you guys
are actually going to be able to see all
these things try it on I just want to
give you guys a sneak peek and then last
I picked up they have like a DITA stuff
there it's I picked up these adidas
sweat pants plus when I got from Marissa
and then the whole point I wish them all
as I told you guys was to get stuff for
sucker cuz I start soccer tonight so I
show you guys oh my god he got his
Jersey because we're blue so I had to
pick up something blue to where I picked
up some shin pads soccer socks and then
so these are supposed to be like indoor
soccer cleats I really want to just
black ones but going and buying all this
stuff the day of wasn't the smartest
idea because the selections were very
minimal you know it works out we're
going to
we're gonna make it work
I'll get done realized it's right before
mine and I can take it if if I want to
I am
and so it is now Sunday I didn't vlog
the last two days just because I was at
a town I'm actually just making a coffee
I woke up super late today the change
and then I'm meeting my semi friend Kat
we're going to the black market in
Toronto it is a beautiful frickin day in
Toronto right now I just drove home 15
degrees out guys
ah
you
it's now Monday I don't even remember
the last verbal update I gave you guys I
have freaking tanks this weekend when it
came to vlogging today is technically
family day in Canada which means it is
holiday so I'm treating this Monday a
little bit more like a Sunday if you my
apartment getting some laundry done I'm
sure there was some clips you guys saw
I've been like last night I spent my
night planning out videos and things
like that what coffee grinds and my
coffees so gross
that's about 1:30 in the afternoon I'm
just having my second coffee kind of
like a pre-workout because I'm going to
go do a workout and I'll blog it with
you guys I'm praying to God to the gym
is like Bacon's I hate filming
I hate filming my workouts when there's
people gym I'll do it anyways because I
love you guys and like do it for the
vlog but my fun news for you guys I'm
thinking I need to like shake things up
on my channel a little bit I'm going to
do a blog challenge that means I'm going
to be doing daily vlogs from now till
the end of February which is only eight
days but the 28th is actually my
birthday so I figured it'd be kind of
fun it's love blog I love editing blogs
I love filming vlogs I figured if I
wanted to get more inspired by filming
again why not do a vlog challenge
working on my yellow mug I'm wearing a
new Metallica t-shirt I'm going to go do
a sick workout some cardio and some abs
because my legs are still really really
sore from soccer which was like four or
five days ago now my life is pathetic
oh I don't know if I've ever shown you
guys done this tricks before but in case
I haven't spin the wheel roll over
say please say please stop such good
manners also that workout was by far
exactly what I needed today I'm gonna go
shower now because I'm sweaty and
disgusting
she takes me okay
so it's now going on 6:00 p.m. day one
of my like editing / uploading blogs the
day of I went downstairs earlier and
picked up a parcel from the fashion
Bibles you guys ever heard of it I'm
just going to do another part I know I
did like a mini hauls the beginning of
this vlog but I figured why not end with
a mini haul real quick so the first one
is just this like pom-pom beanie I just
I have a Halleck desk that's gray and I
needed like a black one because do I
even need to explain myself and we love
black the next thing I got and then kind
of assess is wearing like body suits
like this I'm wearing like a black bra
lat underneath and then putting on a
leather jacket and high-waisted pants so
it looks like it's super like revealing
but I promise like I'm not
I normally you have to see what I wear I
have backup plans for it the next things
I thought was this like a t-shirt dress
I've been obsessed with logo tees
honestly like a whole on dress style and
it was gonna be super cute in the summer
and this one's like one of the shoulders
it's completely open and then I picked
up another one - this one is more like
pink and blue and it doesn't have the
kind of shoulder so it's just like a
full-on long t-shirt dress and then
lastly at least I picked up this sweater
dress here now that like time you get a
little warm to warm kind of concerning
warm like global warming warm Toronto
like our temperature fluctuates so much
so I bet users going to be something in
the next week or so that I can wear this
to but it's just like a big giant
sweater dress any longer in the back and
a little shorter in the front and then
it has like an e neck and it cuffs
around your neck those are the few
things that I picked up from the fashion
bible it's my mini haul for you guys and
for the rest of the night because it's
Monday okay like a Sunday Monday and
I camera just died so I have no idea
what the heck I was just saying so I'm
going to go edit this vlog now and if
the video spent the weekend of going out
late in the night I apologize the
learning process like filming throws a
day editing and then uploading it that
night I hope you guys enjoy this blog
let me guys come in the back and I'm
going to see you guys tomorrow
because daily blogs you know in spending
the last week of being 22 if you guys oh

school Elaine looks just be real never
