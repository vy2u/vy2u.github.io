of time what I'm going to be
live-streaming as well as tweeting it

going to be getting weird guys we're
going to be getting a little weird on
these live streams let me tell ya so if
you guys want to be part of the live
stream fam again definitely download
pocket live check out the link down
below I'll leave all the details and
yeah aside from that let's let's jump
into the vlog shall we what's up guys
and welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm doing the vlog with
you guys because the only reason behind
it is that I've been feeling more
inspired to get back into the vlogging
again I feel like my channel goes
through waves or it's like higher
saturation of logs and then there's like
a higher saturation or highly produced
videos but lately I've just been in the
mood to blog with you guys and kind of
share more of my daily life with all
like the crazy pre filming and editing
that I was doing recently I literally
had no life all of the other things
going on in my life including just like
keeping this apartment clean kind of
went on the back burner and I decided
that it was time to kind of slow that
down plus so many of you guys are like
bring back the blow so here I am
bringing back Plus look still pretty
early in the morning it's only 9 9 13 I
woke up this morning kind of you guys
saw the whole drill Greg slept over last
night so he actually just left I was
watching a bunch of documentaries last
night including like forks over knives
that made Greg watch forks over knives
and I decided that I want to do like a
60 day challenge because they say it
takes about 60 to 90 days I think it's I
think it's somewhere between there to
either break or make a habit and so I
want to get back into just being so
ridiculously healthy like obviously it's
what you guys about my eight-week
challenge with the ABS and that is still
a thing I want to get like really
healthy not just on the outside but on
the inside you know so today starts the
first day and guys guess what's part of
this 60 day challenge you're not going
to believe it
nope I'm going to go coffee
for sixty days it's really so hard today
is only day one and it's like 9 a.m. and
I'm like I would have been at least on
my second coffee by now and only Whole
Foods and like obviously vegan I'm going
to try and make my own food as much as
possible mind you I'm going to be in New
York for this weekend and then I'm going
to LA right after that so it might be a
little hard to make my own food there
but it's going to be interesting because
I'm vlogging both of those trips you
guys are gonna be able to see my
progression for the next 60 days working
out / 60 days of like hardcore health
let's see let's see what kind of
difference it makes 1 I'm hoping that it
can curb the last little bit of my
anxiety but not Lee does like spike up
every few days or so and so I'm hoping
that one this will help with that too
it'll help with bloating and like water
retention because that has been so such
a big problem for me lately like every
time I eat I feel instantly so
uncomfortably bloated after it and then
3 I'm hoping it's going to help with
like my skin and like my sleep and just
overall just like alertness and my mind
things like that so today is the first
day and I'm going to take you guys with
me to do a little grocery haul I'm going
to make some super healthy foods today
I'm going to build a hammock today it's
going to be a good one actually did blog
this weekend which I'll give you guys a
little idea as to what that looks like
you
I can't carry it away I believe too fast
and enough fifty English swearing off on
me everything it's like nothing learning
to eat maybe our head don't list it and
hey the sound of your heart I had like
you okay yeah yeah that was like my
weekend was a little hectic and very
very stressful but so much fun but I
felt like I didn't have enough footage
to make it a full blog so yeah I'm gonna
edit a quick video that's going live
tonight and then I'm going to get ready
you know put pants on and then let's hit
up the grocery store
I've been reading books in both the
Levant enemies a killing sands gold
achilles tennis gear spider messes so I
don't see myself opponent will say where
you are so how much you I'm not okay I'm
going to do a grocery haul see guys and
share with you guys what I got organic
bananas I picked up just a bunch because
my bananas are much go pretty bad so I
also picked up organic blueberries
cucumber to zucchinis because I've been
loving roasted zucchinis especially in
like rice dishes and stuff lately and
since it's in season I picked up some
sweet corn so coconut water because my
boyfriend loves it on a kind of starting
to like if it's really good in smoothies
some blueberry pecan crunch granola
by Nature's Path a whack ton of sweet
potatoes there's literally six of these
bad boys in here and I also picked up
just like normal yellow flash potatoes
got to avocados and onion some organic
crunchy peanut butter watch this week on
in like three days very potentially
could happen I picked up some
unsweetened vanilla coconut yogurt rice
paper to make like veggie spring rolls
as well as just rice noodles for
bootable some fresh kale which is
hilarious because if swimming guys have
been watching me long enough you'll know
that everybody in my life entire
existence called me kale one of those I
heart kale sweaters for like make my
boyfriend and I hard kale sweater that
would be a lot funnier because if I wore
it would be a little you know
self-absorbed hotel Phillips Organic
it's a red pepper and a yellow pepper
some slice mushrooms grapes because this
wasn't even on my grocery list but they
were on sale and when grapes go on sale
you you buy them some organic firm tofu
pack of cherry tomatoes
good old favorite basmati rice this is
like my favorite and like
the rice I make I don't know what it is
about basmati but it's something about
the texture and the flavor that just
makes all surprise taste amazing so that
is my grocery haul and in the meantime
I'm going to go edit a video and set up
my hammock because I recently bought a
hammock for my second patio I'm Omar and
I'm like so freaking excited about it so
I'm going to skip forward all the boring
like editing and work stuff and get
straight to making a hammock
Oh
you
mission accomplished
Oh
Oh
good morning guys it is now Wednesday
morning I just woke up and had breakfast
I had that berry bowl that I just showed
you guys with coconut yogurt granola is
like blueberry granola that I picked up
yesterday and a bunch of berries was so
freaking good they like kind of made up
in the fact that I couldn't have coffee
but like didn't fully but close enough
so I think I'm going to end this vlog
here because I have the weirdest
suspicion that this vlog is already so
freaking long since I included the
weekend this morning I was feeling like
super anxious and like really really sad
if I'm being honest with you guys I just
feel so overwhelmed by things that are
going on in my life right now like the
amount of stress and normally I'm really
good at handling stress but for whatever
reason the last two days it's just like
taking its toll on me and I know that I
leave Friday for New York and then right
when I'm back from New York I leave
right after that for LA and it's just me
oh because I know I don't have enough
videos filmed or pre-filmed to go live
while I'm gone and so there's just like
a lot of stress going on right now and I
know that that's no excuse but I just I
guess it's just kind of taking its
mental toll on me because I hate feeling
like I've let you guys down but there
just has not been enough time to like
get the things done that I need to do
before these trip I do have I think two
videos pre films that I can schedule for
the two two Tuesdays and then I'll put
up logs for the thursdays and just split
the vlogs up that i'm going to be doing
over the next few days but i don't know
it just feels I just wish I had more for
you guys there was so much more I had
planned for you guys and I'm not I am
terrible at like once I planned
something and I say I'm going to do
something if it doesn't get done I get
so hard on myself anyway it's just been
one of those mornings where it hits you
so much harder than it usually does you
pull it all together and you get it done
I'm feeling really good in terms of the
foods that I've been eating it's the
fact that I'm day two coffee free I will
see what kind of headache I have this
afternoon and just in general like what
the hot yoga class I did last night it
was insane it got so hot it was sweating
like crazy but it was such an like
detoxifying feeling no matter what no
matter what kind of like mental state
you feel like you're in if you're super
stressed if you're super sad no matter
what's going on in your life try and
take these little chunks of time to do a
little thing that's going to take care
of yourself like hot yoga going for run
eating something really healthy
doing some meditation reading a book
things like that because those are going
to be the things that keep you saying
trust me and aside from that I hope you
guys enjoyed this vlog thumbs up if you
guys want to see some more vlogs and
other than that I will see you guys all
in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
