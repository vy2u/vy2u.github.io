to be doing a spring life make over
video so I team together with Venus and
came up with this really fun idea of
doing like little ways you can give your
life a makeover for the spring I feel
like after winter everything can kind of
seem really dull and spring is such a
bright and happy and like lively season
so these are just going to be like some
fun beauty ways and some fun non beauty
ways to kind of like give your life a
little bit of a makeover
oh hello Bentley so if you're looking
for some fun new ways to change up your
life for the spring then just keep
watching and he's doing the pillow thing
again you don't want to talk to us okay
so the first thing I like to do when the
spring season comes near is switch out
all of my winter clothes and bring out
some of my more spring warmer more mild
clothes or dresses so I like to switch
out whatever is on my hanging rack in
our room another thing I like to do is
switch out all of my dollar colored nail
polishes for all my bright pretty spring
ones I will put the dollar ones back in
the basket and bring out some more
spring ones and then I'll always give
myself a little manicure as well
and since in the winter I don't shave my
legs as much I take them out of
hibernating season and like to give them
a nice clean shave and as you guys
already know I'm using my Venus swirl
razor it gives a really close shave so
it's really getting rid of all of those
winter beastly hairs as well as it
contours over all of my curves making
sure I don't get any nicks or tricks or
cuts and as well as it has the flexible
technology so it bends and curves in all
different ways getting all the tricky
areas so I'll leave a link to it in the
description box but you guys can get it
at Walmart which you know is where I
pretty much buy everything you can also
give yourself a little bit of a makeover
by trying something completely new with
your makeup whether that be a bold
bright lip if you're someone that
normally doesn't go for that or maybe a
bold eyeliner or maybe a new foundation
routine just really change up your look
and give yourself a fresh new makeup
face for the spring
and if changing up the color or the
length of your hair is just a little bit
too drastic you could always try to
change the part so if you're someone
that normally parts you here on the side
try parting it in the middle or if
you're someone that normally doesn't do
too much to your hair try adding some
braids or try adding a different style
wear it up if you normally wear it down
and it's just a nice fresh look for your
hair some fun lifestyle ways to change
up your life for the spring too is try
looking at some new websites or blogs or
try reading a brand new book go out and
buy something new or change up your
phone I like to change up my background
to something more bright and fun for the
springtime as well so then it's kind of
a fresh change on my phone even
and lastly try adopting a new healthy
habit to your lifestyle whether that be
15-minute you'll go every morning like
I'm doing maybe drinking more water
eating healthy jogging at night whatever
it is that's going to add a little bit
more health to your life so those are
some fun ways you can change up your
life for the spring I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you all in a future
