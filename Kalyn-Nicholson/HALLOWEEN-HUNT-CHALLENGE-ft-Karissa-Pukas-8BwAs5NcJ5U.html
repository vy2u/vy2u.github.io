hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's eachother video I
have a special guest here we have
charissa welcome to my channel thank you
but we did a TMI Tuesday on her channel
which I will link down below so
definitely go check that out but for
today's video we are going to be doing a
Halloween phone scavenger hunt so
everything that we do I'm gonna pop up
on the screen for you guys to see so
basically it the idea or the rules
behind the challenge is we're gonna have
one minute to find each category on our
phones the categories are scary story
scene from a scary movie Halloween foam
paper last-minute costumes and a scary
photo so those are the five categories
we're gonna have one minute to hunt
things down basically we're gonna get
very Halloween festive number one is
going to be a scary story three two one
a canvas at high school thing that we
read like the Raven or whatever that
the rapist you never be no we're
supposed to where I see a dark chocolate
bug like it's hard to see you read this
quick I know I'm seeing sake of knowing
the timers there's you don't know it
zone in oh it's done all right I'll go
first it's called
my daughter learned to count it goes so
many different ways so my daughter woke
me around 11:50 last night my wife and I
had picked her up from her friend
Sally's birthday party brought her home
and put her to bed my wife went into the
bedroom to read while I fell asleep
watching the Braves game daddy she was 4
tugging my sleeve guess how old I'm
gonna be next month
I don't know beauty and said as I
slipped on my glasses how old she smiled
and held up four fingers
it's 7:30 now my wife and I have been up
for it with her for almost eight hours
she still refuses to tell us where she
got them I began tucking him I began
tucking him into bed and he tells me
daddy check for monsters under my bed I
look underneath for amusement and see
him another him under the bed staring
back at me quivering and whispering
daddy there's somebody on my bed that's
really I just thought I got shivers that
was a very odd grammar but that was very
creepy and twisted little creepy story
this is the summary of the event or its
supposedly it's late at night and late
in the air after midnight on a December
evening to be precise a man is sitting
in his room hack reading half falling
asleep and trying to forget his lost
love woman or suddenly he hears someone
or something knocking on the door he
calls out apologizing to the visitor he
imagines must be outside he opens his
door to find not
this freaks them out a little and
reassures himself that it's just the
wind against the window so he goes and
opens the window and in flies you
guessed it in Raven The Raven settles on
a statue above the door and for some
reason our speakers first instinct is to
talk to it he asked first name like you
usually do with a strange bird the Flies
in Deer house right amazingly though
enough the Raven answers back with a
single word Nevermore understandably
surprise the man asked some more
questions the birds vocabulary turns out
to be pretty limited though and all it
says is Nevermore our narrator catches
this catches on to this rather slowly
and ask more questions which gets more
painful and personal the rating of
doesn't change the story and the core
speakers starts to lose his sanity so he
goes crazy basically yes it's like it's
a wild story you should totally read it
wow it's justice but oh my gosh like
that if you've read it I feel like I
want to read that I'm gonna put this in
my phone it's good the Raven yep the
Raven yeah it's basically like full gone
someone going into insanity talking to
this bird - a bird yep but then he
doesn't even know if it's like really
answering him or like it's a good story
okay so number two is going to be a
scene from a scary movie ready three two
one
can I tell you about my scariest thing
my scary scene in real life was going
into a haunted house seeing a rain scene
and there is a television on plain ring
we look away we look back there
literally is a Ricky girl crawling out
of the television chasing us it was the
bad sick though never gone into a much
house merrily now oh my god the green
arrow is like probably one of the most
terrifying yeah
creatures Oh forgotten there we go do
you want to go first that's how I do
this
hate feeling oh my god that's the worst
baby jump I can't I hate it I hate it
already naturally next step
yeah tape it tape it on honestly that I
see she is she she does alive
she's sleeping without pants though and
you can't run away oh you don't have you
can't true good point
I'm getting like warm yeah like I'm
getting like clammy oh my god now she's
not a little Gollum creature
I was terrifying okay so for my scary
clip yeah I chose one from one of like
the most terrifying movies to me as a
child
the signs did you ever watch it do you
think I ever watch scary movies this is
gonna like it follow my god
basically aliens start to come and like
haunt the earth and they're like not
good aliens they're bad aliens this is
one of those like scenes in the middle
of the night you're like don't think
about that scene and then you think
about that scene and then you're like
scaring the out of your show
we'll chill vámanos
in the google like it looks like a lair
yes it does for quickly whitewater oh my
god Game of Thrones seeing man just like
building on top of each other to get oh
my god oh okay next one next category is
a Halloween phone wallpapers on your box
gets it I don't know if I want to do
like spooky or immediately had to go to
Pinterest I mean I have a really good
one right now but I feel like I can't
use it as it'd be cheating see I'm like
way more like a pop-art like that kind
of style Halloween someone's on your
goblin god damn it now I'm on a crunch

DIY last-minute costume so we're allowed

you would have in your household okay so

for this photo damn it oh my god what is
that start behind this is it was raining
and my best friend and I are on vacation
we were probably like 15 or 16 and of
course you're just around and so we
decided on this rainy day to make
ourselves into cheap people oh my god
that's actually I will send it that's
the last thing you want to see when
you're trying to leave the basement
basement your house I don't know how or
why but one time there was glowing green
eyes or like something that we thought
that you saw yeah do you believe in
ghosts I do I do
I think that there's definitely energy
feel like it might be things that are
unfinished or different places where a
lot of sorrow or pain has happened where
the energy
has been cleared I feel like there's
definitely that around especially
through meditation and yoga that you
realize so you actually aren't your body
you're inside your body and I feel like
especially when you dream that's the
biggest time that you like realize it is
that like you were actually an entity
inside an inner body that's just viewing
and experiencing things through your
body when your body is done like where
does the rest of you go but it'll just
like spin off there about goes do you
guys believe and go please I want to
know I'm a down below and if you do tell
