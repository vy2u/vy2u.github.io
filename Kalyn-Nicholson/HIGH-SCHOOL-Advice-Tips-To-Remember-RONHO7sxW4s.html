to be doing some back-to-school
advice and I figured it'd be good to do
kind of like a coffee talk style video
um with coming with back to school
because I feel like there's so many DIYs
and there's so many like hauls and just
so many different back-to-school video -
I just feel like I should start a little
back to school series within advice
video because I want to get to the
important stuff first and then leave all
the fun stuff to later so I'm still
getting over being sick so I might sound
a little Flemmi but yeah I'm sure to
jump in and just give you guys based on
my own experiences and my opinion what
my advice would be for going back to
school now this isn't necessarily for
those of you guys watching that might be
going to college or university you guys
want a college or university advice
style video I can do that one as well or
just kind of growing up into your gear
early twenties but if you guys want that
type of video advice video then just
leave a comment down below but this
one's I would say more so for like high
school so yeah I can do that video as
well just let me know and I am going to
be uploading more coffee talk style
videos to this channel now and yeah
basically yeah part of the content
that's going to be changing on this
channel so I am just going to jump right
in because another really long intro and
I do this every time so my first advice
and it's my advice for like almost
anything in life but especially with
going back to school it's just to try
your best and that's what everything you
do that's not only schoolwork but that's
trying to make new friends or trying out
for a team or this is especially
important when it comes to schoolwork I
find when I was in class um there would
be so many people that would just excel
in science and I was terrible at science
and I could not for the life of me wrap
my head around it and I would try so
hard and it would just it would kill me
because I'd be like why don't I get it
like everybody else gets it and the
thing about trying your best is that
that's what you're doing you're doing
the absolute best that you can and if
that's all you can give and that's all
you get from it then you just have to
accept that not everybody
is going to be a straight-a student or
not everybody is going to be really good
at gym or drama or whatever it is so
just try your best at everything you do
and you can't ever regret it or you
can't ever feel bad about something you
get because you tried your absolute best
now you'll know if you're not trying
your absolute best and you don't get a
very good green well that's because you
didn't try but if you are trying your
absolute best there is nothing you can
do but accept what you get and you know
what there's way more out there than
just needing to be the smartest person
in the classroom to be able to excel at
life like there's so many different
things you can do and we're so trained
to think that right after you got to go
to this you got to go to this school you
have to go to a university you have to
do this crazy stuff of science and math
aren't really your thing then odds are
the job you're going to want to have in
your life for the rest of your life
isn't going to be related to just signs
in that so don't beat yourself up if
you're not a super-smart whiz kid or the
super-awesome drama kit you'll figure
out who you are all you have to do is
try your best my next tip and I know
this is so cliche but it's to be
yourself I know it's so easy especially
in high school to lose yourself in
trying to please other people or to try
to fit it oh I'm just gonna do this
because that's what everybody else does
and then I won't be called out for it or
I want to be accepted into that crowd so
I'm going to just do whatever they do
you shouldn't do that you should just be
yourself and I am somebody that through
in high school I lost myself quite a few
times I'm still figuring out who I am
it's so easy to lose ourselves to try
and please other people but when you do
that you lose a part of who you are and
it takes sometimes a really long time to
find yourself again to get back to the
person that you were before the person
that you know you are if you stay
yourself and you're just being true to
who you are while still being kind to
others you'll find the right friends
you'll hang out with the right people
because you'll be around like-minded
people and I wish I had done that so
much earlier in my life I wish I just
accepted who I was and had just been
myself and not been so afraid of not
fitting in or being accepted so just
accept yourself and be yourself and
you'll find the right friends by doing
it that way
you are going to go through so many
phases you're gonna make so many
mistakes
and the thing is is that's this is the
time of your life where you're supposed
to eat so if you make a mistake and you
mess up and you do something totally bad
or you fail something or you know you
just you screw up you make a big mistake
just try not to beat yourself up for it
and just know that this is the time your
life where you should be making mistakes
I'm not telling you to go out and
purposely make a mistake but I mean this
is the time to be making mistakes
because from mistakes we learn lessons
and nothing in life actually ever is a
mistake it's always always teaching us
something whether it's good or it's bad
you're always learning so you're gonna
make mistakes you just have to accept
that you're not always gonna know what
to do where to go would it be you just
you're gonna make mistakes and if you
don't make those mistakes you're never
gonna figure out who you are or you're
never gonna learn those lessons that are
so important in life it's just gonna
happen so try not to beat yourself up
and learn the lessons from it and just
move on and let it go and don't make
yourself pay for it over and over and
over again and you're just gonna move on
and become better from it so yeah try
not to beat yourself up over mistakes
and speaking of which sometimes
especially if you're in high school or
an elementary school actually any age in
this world when you do make mistakes or
you do butt heads with somebody and
people don't like you people will make
fun of you or they're going to poke fun
at you or whatever it is there's gonna
be people in life that just aren't gonna
like you and hopefully you guys don't
have to go through that but it does it
does happen you have to continue
believing in yourself because nobody
else is going to do it for you you know
yourself more than anybody else does
even if you have no idea who you are you
still know you more than anybody else on
earth especially if this comes to like
getting bullied or made fun of if you
let people get to you
and you let them break down who you are
and change the way you see yourself
change the way you think about yourself
and let them think that they know you
better than you know you then you're
letting them win so try not to doubt
yourself and just stay true to who you
are and believe in yourself
you have to always constantly believe in
yourself as corny as it sounds you don't
stand up for who you are and you aren't
confident at least in yourself and who
you are you going to be a
percent confident but just know that
nobody knows you better than you know
you
so don't let anybody's idea of you or
anybody's thoughts on you change the way
you see yourself in the way you view
yourself because you you just got to be
there for yourself as weird as that
sounds I just said yourself a lot also
it's completely normal to feel alone and
sad through whatever phase of school
you're going through I remember in
elementary school I remember in high
school and I remember in college going
through phases where I felt really alone
and really sad even when I was
surrounded by all of my friends and I
remember thinking does anybody else feel
this way because I swear I look around
and it doesn't seem like it but it does
so many other people feel that way even
if they just don't mention it or don't
admit it or whatever it's going to
happen you're going to feel alone at
times you're going to feel sad at times
because these are the years of your life
where you're really discovering who you
are and where you want to go and what
you want to be and it's so much pressure
and everything changes so quickly in
such a short amount of time and you're
gonna go through phases where you're
gonna feel sad about that or you're
gonna feel like you're surrounded by so
many people and you still feel alone
maybe you won't go through that but for
me I definitely did and there's nothing
wrong with feeling lonely inside it's
just you have to ask yourself why you're
feeling those things are you hanging out
with the right people or are you kind of
hanging out with bad friends or maybe
it's just that you're not you know
spending enough time for yourself or
doing things that make you feel happy
and passionate just because you're in
school doesn't mean you can't still have
passions and you can't still do things
outside of school but regardless just
know if you ever go through phases where
you feel alone or sad it's completely
normal and you're not alone we've all
been there we all are here so yeah just
reach out to your internet friends
because I'll come keep you company and
also I know I touched on this earlier
but you're gonna go through phases
you're gonna go through so many phases I
went through like an emo phase I went
through a country phase where I
literally thought I was like a southern
belle and I live in Canada I remember
going through a really tomboy phase I
remember going through so many phases in
life so many I had dyed my hair dark I
died
two different colors I dyed my hair like
neon yellow blonde so many different
phases and that's part of discovering
who you are you're trying on different
costumes to see which one's fits the
best the biggest thing I have learned is
that who you are isn't what you look
like or what you do necessarily it's
just it's who you are as a person the
way you treat people your patience when
you're waiting for something there's
just there's so much more to people than
what they wear what they do and who they
hang out with so you're gonna go through
phases know that those are so important
and you're gonna look back I'm telling
you you're gonna look back you're gonna
facepalm when you look back on your
phases trust me I'll put a picture right
here and you guys won't believe me but
this is me and I look at this picture
and I want a facepalm because I'm like
oh my god what was I thinking but I
don't regret it and I can look back on
all my phases and I can laugh now
because to me it's funny and part of
like the path that led me to being Who I
am and if it meant that I was out there
a little bit that's a little weird at
times and whatever at least I had the
courage to try what I wanted to try even
if it was completely wrong for me
everybody goes to them everybody goes
through phases where they think they're
totally someone they're not these phases
will create the fundamentals of who you
are they're gonna tell you what you like
and what you don't like and you're gonna
learn so much from these phases so I
mean go through them and feel it who you
are and figure yourself out because
that's half the fun of being a person
especially being a teenager is figuring
out who you are and also for those of
you out there that were kind of like me
in high school this might not apply to
everybody but it's okay to not want to
go to the party there were definitely
times in high school where I did want to
go out and party and I wanted to be in
there with the in-crowd as you guys know
I also suffered with anxiety and
depression throughout high school so
there were definitely times where I'd
find reasons to bail out or I would DD
even though nobody should be drinking
alcohol in high school but let's get
real I would DD just so that I could
leave the party and go home because of
my anxiety but it's not just my anxiety
I was also somebody that in high school
hanging out with my family sometimes on
a Friday night was kind of more fun than
going to a party you know watching a
movie and hanging out with my sister
or whatever it was sometimes that was
just more fun or even just having my
best friend over and watching movies and
picking out on popcorn sometimes I would
just rather do that over a party and I
remember for the longest time wondering
why was that way as I got older I
realized that I might be or seem like an
extrovert but I'm kind of an introvert
I'm an extroverted introvert if that
makes any sense so for all of the
introverts out there I know it's hard to
like go out to parties and put yourself
out there so if you don't want to
sometimes then just don't I'm somebody
that would much rather stay in with a
couple good friends then go out clubbing
or to a party or whatever and that's
something it took me a while to accept
about myself and I used to think it was
just part of my anxiety but it's not I'm
just somebody that likes to chill I
guess also times where me and my friends
or me and my friend or whatever weren't
even invited so I mean it happens to
everybody and it's totally okay and on
that note my last and final tip
especially for those of you guys in high
school is there is so much more to your
life and to who you are then who you
hang out with who you date or what
happens in high school or elementary
school or whatever it is I know because
I've been there that it can feel like
the end of the frickin world when
something goes wrong in high school or
when somebody breaks up with you or
somebody's bullying you and it feels
like you have nothing left I mean I went
through a phase where I got bullied
really really really hard so I remember
thinking like it doesn't get worse than
this I can't get up and go to school I
can't go and show my face anywhere there
is so much more to your life there's so
much more to who you are and what you
did said hung out with dated whatever in
high school will mean nothing in the
future or it could mean something I mean
I can't say that for everybody maybe
you'll marry your highschool sweetheart
who knows but all I'm trying to say is
for those of you out there that worry
that you're not going to be popular not
going to be cool or whatever there's so
much more to your life than what
happened in high school and there's so
much more to who you are then
who you were just keep that in mind guys
that is it for my price if I missed
anything feel free to leave it down
below oh my gosh I'm gonna call my throw
it's like tickling when I talk and I
missed anything or if you guys think of
any more advice feel free to leave it
down below and we'll just all give each
other advice or whatever so that
