back to my channel for today's video I
am doing it they much ever highly
requested huge fall try on haul guys I
have so much stuff here to show you guys
it's kind of ridiculous I went all out
with fall shopping this year I have one
two three six different stores to show
you guys and a lot of stuff from all the
stores I haven't done like a big huge
shopping haul and what feels like
forever with fall coming around it's
like my favorite time of year I was
feeling super uninspired by like my
closet and the clothes in it and I
really just wanted to go all out push
myself to wear a really cool fashion and
really cool clothes that I enjoy this
fall if you guys have been enjoying
youto Burst Apart thumbs up this video
and let me know down below and if you
guys aren't following me already be sure
to check out my Twitter and Instagram I
forget which side I think the side I've
been posting a ton of fall photos and
tweets and all of that good stuff so if
you want to stay in this little October
cocoon then definitely come follow me on
there I don't like to show you guys so I
feel like we should just jump in so for
the first are going to show you guys
let's do H&amp;amp;M because something I'm
wearing is actually from there so
recently I went and pulled a bunch of
stuff from H&amp;amp;M I purchased this cropped
purpose sweater like Justin Bieber it's
so comfy it's so cozy it's just like a
hoodie it says World Tour on the arms
and that just says purpose the world
tour across the front I was looking for
like a cropped red hoodie for a really
long time and I initially didn't really
want any writing or anything on it but
when I was out each name and I saw this
I was like you know what Justin Bieber's
worth it the second thing I picked up
and you guys have seen this already is
this like army green sweatshirt I wore
this in and outfits of the week video if
you guys haven't seen it already it's
just like this really cute cozy knit the
thing I like about this one too is it's
perfect for the earlier months of fall
or if you guys are living
somewhere that's a bit warmer it's a
little bit more thin so you could wear
this over like a t-shirt dress you could
wear it with pants there's so many
different ways you can wear it the
second thing I have to share with you
guys is this bag here so I was doing a
bit of like a back-to-school
collaboration with H&amp;amp;M and one of the
things that I actually decided to pick
up was this bag and it's perfect because
I use it for dates that I edit so I
don't know if I've told you guys this
already but I have a set schedule for my
filming and editing so at the week and
Tuesdays and Thursdays I tend to leave
my apartment I like to go to cafes and
stuff and do all my editing on my laptop
work there it just kind of gets me out
of the house it's my laptop my agenda
I can even fit like a coffee I bring my
tumbler coffee cup so then next to me to
them I have another hoodie to share with
you guys this is another one of like my
new favorites right now I have makeup on
it because I was wearing it I picked up
the Harvard hoodie from H&amp;amp;M and it's the
comfiest sweater ever this is like my
Sunday sweater
because I don't super comfy sweater and
really perfect for the Fall if you guys
are looking for just like some cozy
comfy like chill at home sweater this is
perfect and then next from H&amp;amp;M I decided
to pick up this little black skirt as
well I'm gonna do the zipper so you guys
can see it's in like a fake suede
material and it just has the zipper up
the front but it's gonna be perfect for
like body suits or cropped sweaters this
fall and this material I just feel like
it's such I don't know it's such like a
winter slash fall material to wear the
next thing I picked up was a pair of
black jeans now I've been looking for
awhile for a pair that had the rips only
in the knees and I like them because
they're stretchy they're comfy and they
were relatively cheap and they are
high-waisted so they are super comfy and
they look good with everything I feel
like this is such a staple to have in
your closet for the fall time actually
quite a few pairs of shoes to show you
guys but the first pair is from H&amp;amp;M and
they are these ones here I am obsessed
with these I love the round toe which is
totally different than I've been going
really point toe with everything else
lately and I just feel like this is
something Spice Girls me would have worn
back in the 90s you know and considering
they're H&amp;amp;M they're actually really
comfortable and they go great with
everything and not to mention they
they are kind of like rubber they're
perfect for when it's raining out and
they have grips on the bottom so you
will not slip and slide everywhere and
then last but not least from H&amp;amp;M I
picked up a pair of comfy shorts so
they're just for lounging again around
they're perfect for that harvard sweater
I cannot sleep in pants
it drives me up the wall I don't even
like to hang out in pants if I'm in my
apartment and I'm not going anywhere
I'll always switch into shorts and you
can use them for like working out too
you don't just have to use them for
pajamas so that is it from H&amp;amp;M moving on
I'm gonna share with you guys some of
the stuff that I got from my sweet sweet
show PO my number one place to shop I
swear guys my style I just meant to be
Australian I also have Lola Shoetique in
this too so this is the sucker I picked
up from show PO again you're gonna see a
lot of this color in this haul it's this
super soft it almost has like a
fluffiness to it crop to sweater and
it's got just like a stitch down the
middle and it's the really cute thing
about it too is the sleeves they kind of
like bubble sleeves and I am obsessed
with this color for the fall time I
bought so much burnt orange in this haul
you have no idea the next thing I picked
up was this little I mean it's kind of
like a cross up between a cardigan and a
trenchcoat you could wear it like a
trench coat but I've just been wearing
it as a breezy little cardigan with
jeans and a bodysuit it's this one here
again it's in the burnt orange it's made
out of blouse materials so it's super
light and breezy and comfy perfect if
you guys are living in warmer climates
and then you have a tie so you can pull
it all together in the front and tie it
like a trench coat or a jacket or you
can leave it open which is what I do and
where it's sort of like a cardigan or
just lookout staple to your outfit and
then next I got another sweater this
one's super cute too it's a bit longer
you guys are gonna notice I'm terrible
at describing clothes probably gonna
repeat myself a million times in this
haul but this is just a soft almost nude
colored sweater big giant stretching
neck and you can kind of wear it off the
shoulder
I'm loving just giant baggy sweaters
like this for the fall time the next
from Teahupoo I decided this was a
little out there okay but this is gonna
be so chic with like the right outfit I
picked up this faux fur black jacket if
you were to put my soul in the jacket
childhood me would be so so pleased with
this purchase the way that I would pair
this is probably with just like a black
bodysuit black pants black boots just go
all out and it's perfect too because
it's gonna be nice and warm leading into
the wintertime the only thing that I
will say is I wish it had pockets it
doesn't have pockets but it doesn't
really matter because it's so perfect in
itself and then the next thing I picked
up I purchased a lot of jackets okay
guys I've been really trying to up my
jackets I think if there's one staple I
had to choose as a favorite this year it
would be jackets because I feel like no
matter what outfit you put together if
you put the perfect jacket on top of it
you're golden so this jacket here this
one's really I can't describe it it's
kind of got a stretchiness to it but it
is so soft and so warm and I love the
color of this it's a really long gray
trenchcoat this one does have pockets
can confirm this is something that you
could easily throw on just to keep
yourself warm but it also kind of adds a
little bit of like a chic / professional
vibe so next and this might actually be
my favorite thing in this entire haul I
picked up this romper from Shoko again
in the burnt orange color but it's kind
of like a silk detailing this is the
cutest romper I've ever seen in my life
um but this is my new favorite fall
romper it's so cute I love the cut of
this it is like the most flattering
thing and you could be so bloated it
doesn't matter how much pumpkin pie you
eat you can wear this any time of day
it's super comfy and I love the bows
around the wrists and last but not least
I picked up again in the burnt orange a
pair of their pants that have like the
bow and the fries have been trying to
force myself to venture away from the
skinny jeans and the leggings and get
some more like tailored pants with a
little black bodysuit this could be
super cute especially if we're going out
for like dinner or like a fall brunch
slette is it from show PO next I want to
share with you guys really quick a
jacket that I got when I went shopping
with Greg here in the city if you guys
haven't seen the vlog I'll post it up on
the screen
we're but we went to this place called
TNT I'd never heard of it before I
actually picked up this unisex jacket
that's meant for guys and girls but it
is this adidas and Alex Wang collection
and it's really cool because it's
versatile so you can wear it on this
side as well but I love it's like the
fake it almost feels like fake sheep fur
or whatever and it's giant and fluffy
and this is again this would be so sick
if you wore it with like black pants a
black shirt and like really cool
sunglasses and then next I'll do forever
21 one of the first things I picked up
from forever 21 was this shirt here
again in that army green color I'm
trying to venture out guys I just
grabbed this cropped in New York shirt
again perfect for lounging around I also
think this would look really cute with
like black high-waisted pants and really
cute black booties for the fall time and
you could rock this with one of those
black jackets that I've talked about
there's just all of these clothes just
intertwine
so nicely guys I lost my black cap so I
decided to pick up a new one from
forever 21 and the cute thing about this
one is it has a little bow in the back
so you can tighten it as much as you
want but that is the stance very
standard black hat but I love the bow
detailing and I really needed to replace
my missing black hat the next thing I
got was this bodysuit and it is a
burgundy bodysuit it's actually only 20
bucks it reminds me again of something
very spice girl it's a halter and it's
got this really cute scoop neck
detailing and the material is sort of
like spandex mixed with silk I feel like
this would be so nice for a fall like
date night with a cute pair of jeans I
don't have anything like this in terms
of body suits so I decided to pick that
up and then next I grabbed this t-shirt
dress here this is honestly probably my
second favorite purchase in this haul it
is just this tight kind of knitted
material t-shirt dress and my favorite
part about it is the bottom has the
scoop detailing so I feel like that's
super flattering and the material of
this is actually incredible considering
it's forever 21 it's super stretchy but
it's nice and thick so that is the black
t-shirt dress that I got and again with
the burnt orange I picked up this off
the shoulder top which is super cute is
super stretchy I hate wearing bras but
you would definitely need to with this
one but it's so cute it's just looking
nice off the shoulder top it would be
really nice for like thanks
or I don't even know you can wear this
to so many different things because it's
the perfect amount of like cute but
casual this was only $22.90 and I feel
like I've seen this style of shirts so
many other places for so much more than
that and then the second hat I decided
to pick up from forever 21 is this black
beanie I can't seem to find mine from
last year the only thing is I do wish it
was like a bit a bit more baggy
it was only eight dollars so you can't
really go wrong because I also decided
to pick up a few accessories from
forever 21 - in terms I really want to
get back into blogging like outfits and
stuff like that so I decided to pick up
some purses and when it comes to purses
especially if I'm buying one that's just
meant to go with specific kinds of
outfits I don't really like to splurge
on super expensive ones so I decided to
pick this one up here from forever 21
it's in this really nice like nude baby
pink color I'm obsessed it's actually
the color of my nails right now - and
again I just feel like this blush color
is so nice for the fall time and it's
gonna go so cute with so many outfits
that I grabbed if you want to put it
like over the shoulder it comes with the
strap so you can like hook it on and
actually wear it across your shoulder or
crossbody which is how I actually use my
purses I hate using the handles like
this as a purse because it's just I need
mobility in my arms and then with all
the traveling and stuff I've been doing
lately I decided to pick up this duffle
bag from forever 21 I just thought it
was super cute and I loved that it was
like the brown like faux leather I
thought that this would be perfect for
traveling around to go along with my
suitcase it's actually the perfect size
especially for like a weekend or
overnight also so epic came with a free
bag of chips but yeah the size of this
is definitely perfect for an overnight
like two or three nights or as a
carry-on and again it came with the
straps so you can throw it over your
shoulder if you guys want to see a
what's in my travel or what's my
carry-on thumbs up or leave a comment
down below Greg and I have plans to
actually head somewhere tropical in
November so I can easily film that video
for you guys so that's it from forever21
next I'm gonna share with you guys what
I picked up from Lola Shoetique it was
not lying when I said that this was a
huge haul okay this is also a collective
haul but this is a huge haul the first
thing I picked up and these are by far
my favorite thing in existence right now
I picked up these new pair of booties
can we just take a hot second like look
at these are epic
so these are actually like a fake velvet
and I was not expecting that for
whatever reason I thought that they were
gonna be more like fake leather when I
saw them on the site I've all the
buckling along the side and they're like
pointed toe and the nice thing about
them too is the actual booty is maybe
two inches at most so these are so comfy
you can walk around like I literally
walked home the other day it was like a
40 minute walk and I was so comfy
they're so cute and they are going to be
such a huge staple for me this fall
because look at how thick they are
the next thing I purchased from Lola
Shoetique is this bodysuit so this is
also going to be a huge staple for me
this is one of those things that I was
so weary about buying because I wasn't
sure how it was gonna fit and I'm so
obsessed that I went back on the website
and bought it in black - it's this
really nice like stretchy but tight
material I had boobs when I was like 12
so I always got made fun of and I think
that like subconsciously it's always
caused me to kind of cover up my boobs
but what I do decide to take them out I
like wearing things that I know is gonna
hold them in place and I won't have to
worry about them all night and this
bodysuit is literally that in a nutshell
next I've decided to pick up a parent
they're kind of like mom jeans
I'm loving the ripped knee detailing
these ones are totally different from
the ones for mation on because these are
not like tight or they're not like
jegging material either and there are a
bit more of like a charcoal gray than
they are black but they're super cute
and next thing that I purchased and this
is probably my favorite thing from Lola
Shoetique that I grabbed aside from
those booties but it is this sweater
here I know it just looks like a
standard black sweater but trust me I'm
gonna do the cutaway clip so you guys
can see it but this is like the perfect
amount of fitted but also oversized at
the same time like the sleeves are so
baggy the top is really like open and
loose so you can wear it off the
shoulder you can pull it down off of
both of your shoulders mind if I'd a bit
of a distressed detailing in the collar
along the sleeves and along the bottom -
in terms of comfy and lounging around
this is probably gonna be my favorite
sweater this year and then the next
thing I purchase your Lola Shoetique is
this cropped charcoal shirt again it's
got that distressed detailing along the
top collar and such and it looks like
it's just been like scissor crops it's a
good staple to have and you could dress
it up or wear it casually anything
cropped lately I'm obsessed with you
guys watched my videos
last year you'll know that I have a pair
of these in black that are also for a
little chic so this year I decided to go
ahead and pick up a pair of thigh high
boot ease but in this like move tan
color it's like the chunky booty so you
can actually wear these a little bit
more casually as well and I love them
because they have this like gold
detailing on the heel which again is
super nice for fall but it also just
adds like a nice touch to them and we
are now coming to the tail end of this
never-ending haul I'm now going to show
you guys just a few things that I picked
up from a ritzy Elle when I went to the
mall the other day and first things
first you guys have seen this sweater
already in the outfits of the week video
I posted it back in its if he give us at
the end of August or beginning of
September and it is this cropped like
scalloped hoodie here again in that like
perfect burnt orange color and my
favorite part about this is the bottom
of it has like the scalloped detailing
so I just think that's so cute for the
Fall there's just so many ways you can
rock sweaters like this and again like I
said anything cropped this year I'm
obsessed with and then next I decided to
pick up one more jacket this one was on
sale it's by the brand Babbitt on and
it's kind of in that almost beige but
kind of has a bit of blush to it if any
of you guys are like professionals young
professionals or you need like a work
jacket this is definitely perfect and
when I went to the store to pick it up
it was originally 245 dollars and I got
it on sale for 175 which is still pretty
expensive but this is such good quality
and such nice material I've been
watching a lot of Gilmore Girls lately
and every time Rory wears like a sick
trench coat I'm like I need a trench
coat for days that I want to wear like
an all-black outfit this will be the
perfect trench coat to put on top and
then last but most certainly not least
the last thing I have to share with you
guys is this bodysuit that I picked up
from a ritzy ax and it's just this black
bodysuit here just like a pretty
standard tank top material but again at
the material this is nice and thick but
stretchy this is like my favorite
material so that is it for my huge giant
collective fall haul leave a comment
down below telling me your favorite item
from this haul if you like this video is
already so long so I'm not gonna bore
you guys with a super long out joke but
just know that I'd love you guys to the
moon aback I hope you're enjoying all
the video
and aside from that I'll see you guys
