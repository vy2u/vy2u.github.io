biggest spring haul for you guys like
there are so much clothes and stuff that
I have to show you so before I get
started I'm gonna make this intro short
and sweet since this is going to be I'm
assuming quite a long video I did
purchase everything myself this is all
for the spring and this was also
collective so it's not like I got it all
in one hit like it's I've been getting
stuff since about February for the
spring time so that is just my quick
disclaimer also I have a trip planned to
go to LA so a lot of the stuff well most
of the reason why I bought some of this
stuff is because of some of the videos
I'm going to be filming in LA for you
guys like some look books and such so be
sure to thumbs up this video if you guys
want to see like look books with all the
clothes as well as some vlogs and stuff
while I'm in LA and I'm just going to
jump right in and get started so I'm
gonna start out with the body shop just
cuz this one is really quick I just got
a few little things for the spring time
extra virgin minerals the body shop a
liquid foundation and this was on for
like five dollars I got that I also got
a coconut hand clan's gel it's a
sanitizer for like traveling but not
least if you guys read on my last video
I always ask you little questions in the
downbar what your favorite scent was for
spring I mentioned that mine is peach so
I needed a new body butter since I'm
running low so I picked up the one in
peach and this literally smells so good
and I'm more of like a warm scented
person I like Vanilla's and coconuts and
nut butters but I decided to go with
peach for the springtime so moving on
the next place I went to was American
Eagle and I just got one thing from
there and it was on sale really bright
coral dress it's not showing up as
bright as it really is on camera it's
like super neon coral but basically it
just has like it goes up around your
neck like this and those are the
armholes obviously and then it cinches
at the waist and then it just flows down
into a dress so next I'm gonna show you
guys the stuff I got from Wet Seal so
much to show you guys from this website
I got a lot of stuff because I plan on
wearing a lot of it in LA and I'm
actually going to be visiting the Wet
Seal headquarters on there too so I have
some cool stuff that I'll be showing you
guys from there
it's a sunflower print dress and it just
has little spaghetti straps and it's
just one of those slip dresses that you
just kind of throw on really quick if
you're running up the house and you can
easily easily dress this up or dress it
down I got this Jean vest from there and
this is what it looks like it's just
like a medium toned Jean vest and I
don't have like a Jean vest or a jean
jacket so this is like perfect these
guys I've literally been debating for so
long purchasing a pair of pants like
this because I love the way they look on
people but you know those times really
like is that gonna look great on me but
I decided to get them and they're in
this print right here and I reason why I
got these ones versus there was a pair I
was gonna get from urban planet is I
loved the floral print whereas the other
one was more tribal and I thought found
it would have been harder to put that
into an outfit whereas floral is really
easy I could just wear this with a white
top or one of the colors from the print
pants and basically what the kind of
pants that are cinched at the top and
then they just kind of parachute down
and then they're kind of skinnier
towards the bottom and if you guys have
seen people wearing these then you'll
know what I'm talking about but I'm
literally obsessed with them next this
is probably one of the fit my favorite
things and it is this top really cute
for spring and summer it's this floral
print again and it's just like a sheer
you'd have to wear like a like a white
thing underneath it but it's just sheer
and it's spaghetti strap and then the
bottom has this crochet detailing this
maxi skirt which again I'm in love with
the print on it so the top is like this
and you would obviously just wear a
shirt cover to cover and then this is
like of a print on it it's striped and
it's got like a like a Jean colored but
it's not Jean material then it's got
this like chiffon floral e print and
then it has the same thing again but in
white and I just think it is so pretty
and it flows all the way down to the
bottom so I'm like obsessed with maxi
skirts you guys are gonna see a lot of
maxi skirts in this video this is
probably tied for first with one of my
favorite tops that I got from Wet Seal
so it is this crop top here and you'll
see that it's just white with lace
detailing it has like a little white
underneath to cover up like where your
chest achill is but this is my favorite
part about it it's cropped in the front
but then it's hi-low and it goes super
low in the back like just past your butt
and this is so pretty I feel like it's
perfect for like festival season next I
have this dress and it again is a
spaghetti dress with a floral print
it's got like pink detailing on these
straps and such then it's got a little
sweetheart neckline and in the
background it is cinched in the back if
you guys can see that and then it just
kind of flows out from the bottom I love
really flowy dresses because you can
wear these when you're bloated and
nobody knows I have this white cardigan
or ship-like crocheted detailed cardigan
and then my favorite part about this is
if you look on the arm it's got um these
like arm detailing and it's also
bat-winged if you can see that so this
will look really really cute over many
tops of the springtime as well as over
my bathing suit and just so many other
things so next I have a maxi dress for
you guys which will be perfect for the
beach and it is this red detailing with
floral on it spaghetti strapped in the
front and then it just follows all the
way down and it's flowy and then it's
got this really pretty like ruffle
detailing on the bottom if you guys can
see that
so next or what seal I got this pink
slip on dress if you guys have seen them
they're called like slip dresses the
style is basically that you can just
literally throw it on and slip it off
there's no like extra stuff you have to
do to it you can literally just toss it
on and this is what it looks like it's
this like peachy baby pink and it's got
like more of a if you guys can see that
like ruffle detailing but it's not
ruffled it just has like the block
detailing and then my favorite part
aback about it is the back if you guys
can see that the back is an open back
with just a string in the back next I am
literally obsessed with these and they
are these shorts that I got there like
singed or whatever at the top and then
they just kind of are just plain normal
shorts you'd wear them a little bit
high-waisted and the material tees are
so comfortable and they're so flowy and
free and they'll keep you nice and cool
in the spring in the summer time next I
got a pair of plain high-waisted jeans
shorts because you can never have too
many this is what they look like and
they've got all the you know distressed
detailing on the bottom and then this is
the back and they are literally perfect
because these go with like every single
top ever next I got this
cardigan it is like this pinky gray kind
of purply color it's hard to explain the
color of this one but it's like very
very open and airy and they're 3/4 arms
and then a ruffle detailing on the
bottom again this reminds me so much of
Taylor Swift and it is a polka dot dress
the front of it is like this and it just
has half sleeves and then it buttons
down it goes all the way down and then
there's a bow that you tie in the middle
with a little string and then it just
flows down so I actually don't have a
dress in this style which is why I
picked this one out and I'm loving it
and if you guys want to see different
ways to style this be sure to thumbs up
for that lookbook next I have this skirt
and it is like a beige and white striped
a skater skirt next I have this white
top if you guys have seen my other
California top and you'll know that I am
obsessed with this like logo on the
front it just says California Republic
and it has the bear and the cute thing
about this is it's got more pink into it
and it's also a lace top I got this top
here and it just is a plain like almost
not chiffons like this really nice flowy
top and it's got lace detailing around
the arms if you guys can see here and
then my favorite part about this tank
top is the back it's got like that cut
off detailing or slit detailing so it's
actually featured on the show crust
crush by ABC Family the next top I have
to show you guys is just these tops that
I like to wear around the house or
workout in and it is like the cutoff
sleeve tops
this one says Los Angelos New York and
it has this almost tie-dye or dip dye
effect to it where it's purple and then
it kind of goes into a blue turquoise
color and then the last stop I have to
show you guys is the one I'm wearing and
it says love you to the moon and back
and again is the same style top where
it's just kind of cut off with the
sleeves and like I just said I like to
wear it around the house when I'm just
kind of hanging out at home last thing I
have to show you guys from what seal are
the gladiator shoes that I got there are
these white gladiator shoes I'll take
them out of the bag just these white
gladiator shoes for springtime for like
a maxi skirt or anything else that you
might be wearing we're going to go into
what
got from this store our Dean which I
have to beg right here so the first
thing I got is this scarf and I have a
DIY planned in mind for this scarf I've
been seeing everybody wear these really
really cute like Beach covers that have
like a detailing on them and I've been
trying to find one everywhere and I just
find they're really really expensive so
I decided to grab a scarf and do my own
little tie off but then I thought why
don't I just kind of make my own beach
cover so I'm going to figure out how to
turn this into a beach cover so if you
guys would like a DIY be sure to thumbs
up this video and let me know down below
I've got a couple pair of shoe pairs of
shoes from our Dean so the first one I
got are these brown detailed flip-flops
which just kind of look like this
they're just slip on slip off and these
will be so easy for the spring and
summertime pair that I got is again just
an easy slip on slip off but these ones
have more of a salmony pink detailing
and the last one is another pair of
gladiators and these are in the brown
detailing too and it's mostly because I
like getting like the brown ones because
I have a lot of like Brown accessories
like my fringe bag and such so the
bathing suit that I got from our Dean if
you guys have seen the latest trend is
those bathing suits from a website and I
believe it's Australia called triangle
but they're really really expensive so I
ended up getting like a knockoff version
where they tried to recreate the look so
this is the top and it's in that Tiffany
teal blue color with a pink zipper and
this is the back and then the bottoms
are just the exact same idea where they
just look like this and again they're in
this like Tiffany aqua seafoam color
which they will have more of a green
tint to it in real life but they're
coming up a really baby blue on camera
so moving on I'm going to show you some
of the stuff that I got from urban
Planet and for starters I just got this
little fedora hat it's in like a crochet
or white detailing or it's more of like
a cream color and then it has this
little brown tie off on it and I just
thought I needed a hat to wear for when
I go on vacation to LA next I got a
black maxi skirt and this one I believe
was I have the tag in here so this
almost ten dollars and it's just normal
like cotton detailing and it
a plain black maxi skirt that goes all
the way to the bottom is this white one
and it's because I needed something that
was going to fit a lot of the white
stuff that I got so this is what it
looks like it's just got that like
ruffled detail it's not really ruffled I
don't really know what to call it but
where it kind of has like blocking all
the way down and then it flows out at
the bottom and it matches exactly the
thing I bought it for I got this romper
um if you guys don't know from watching
my videos last summer or spring I am
obsessed with rompers or jumpers
whatever you want to call them so this
one is black and white and let me try
and figure out how to okay here so this
one is black and white and this is what
it looks like it's got like a button-up
detailing and then it just kind of has
shorts on the bottom instead of a dress
which is what a romper is if you didn't
know and the cool thing about this one
too is the straps are crisscross when
you put it on they cross the next thing
I got from urban planet was also $15 and
it's just this crochet top that I'm
going to plan on wearing over like my
bathing suit or something so it's just a
crop top in this cream color and it's
all crochet next I'm going to move on to
forever 21 so the first thing I got to
show you guys that I got from forever 21
is this really really pretty it's like a
busty roar I always say it wrong it's
like a bust year or whatever you guys
want to call it this is the deep like
pattern it has on it and then the cool
thing about it is this is what it looks
like it's a halter top it's got an
opening right here and then the back
just zips up on the side and then the
back is just plain and it also has that
kind of rubbery like inside here that
keeps them from falling down I got
another one of these muscle tees as you
can tell I'm obsessed of them this one
says la and it has this really pretty
black and white floral print I just got
this dress and I think it might be my
Easter dress but I could be wrong I'm
not too sure exactly if I'm gonna wear
it for Easter yet but it is this
cream-colored lace detailing and on the
inside it has this silk slip dress to
keep it from being obviously see-through
so it looks just like this it's got
sleeveless and then it's in just the
middle and then it just flows out and
it's this really really pretty thick
lace detailing the next thing I got was
what I originally planned on wearing and
before I decided to kind of make my own
little beach cover but I'm probably
still gonna wear it and it is just this
white crochet cardigan and it is super
super long in the back and it's
completely like see-through kind of idea
I was gonna wear this over my bathing
suit since you'd be able to see right
through to my bathing suit and it's just
something cute to wear while you're
heading to and from the beach but also
look really cute over certain length
dresses and rompers for the springtime
here is another jumper that I got is
this orange and yellow sunflower pattern
so it's just like a normal thick strap
in the front and then it cinches again
at the middle and then the bottom are
shorts and the nice thing about this is
it is kind of ruffled in the back so it
keeps it nice and tight and also it has
strings here that you can tie a bow in
the back which is so cute is this
sunflower maxi skirt and this one has
slits up the each side so it kind of
makes it more flowy and more open so
that is that and it's just a pretty
yellow sunflower detailing all the way
down to the bottom then for the little
accessories that I got from forever 21 I
will show you the first thing I got was
just this white smooth and white Too
Faced coat and it's just a nail polish
just a white base coat which will
actually make your colors pop more on
your nails the next one I got is an
ultra hydrating coconut body cream and
this is to take with me when I go on
vacation because I like bringing travel
size since you don't want to bring too
many big things since I'm only going for
about a week the next thing I got and if
one of one of these are so long is this
little owl lip chapped lip gloss and the
last thing I got is just this it's I
think it was like $1 yeah it was a
dollar 80 and it's a little sunflower
bow on an elastic so if you're throwing
like a ponytail in your hair though
moving on to some of the last things
that I got the next
went to was an outlet for stitches and
I'm going to show you everything in this
outlet was ten dollars or less so it was
like a huge steal of the store um the
first thing I'm going to show you is I
got a black peplum top and this is just
for like going out something fancy I
didn't have a black one so I went ahead
and got one next thing I got are these
crochet or lace cream lace detailed
shorts and they're high-waisted with a
zipper in the back the next thing I got
was what I originally wanted when I was
looking for a black maxi skirt but I
wasn't able to find one and it is a
chiffon black maxi skirt so it is
see-through and it also has the slits
down the sides on each side and then it
has shorts underneath so obviously it's
not see-through for your bum are these
really really cute and the zippers
undone it's these shorts they're like a
almost like a silky detail but they're
not made of silk I can tell you that
much they were eight dollars and they
are high-waisted they zip up on the
sides and then they're just this really
pretty like flowy kind of short that you
could just wear with like a white top
and I just think they're really cute
it's a white crop top and it's got the
sweetheart neckline for wearing
something high-waisted and this was $7
and next thing I got is another scarf
that I'm planning on making into a beach
cover or a cardigan for like a dress or
shorts the last thing I got are these a
low makeup remover cleansing tissues and
these were just on the counter when I
went up to the front and they were on
for 350 so I got some now on the last
seat items that I have to show you guys
first I'm going to go for Charlotte
Russe I recently went to the States
and I only picked up two things from
there so this is the crop top that I got
for Charlotte Russe and it was $5 and
it's just a black and white striped
thick strapped crop top the next thing
that I got are these high heels shoes
from Charlotte Russe and these are
adorable
I was looking for a pair of black high
heels cuz I don't have a good
comfortable pair so when I went to the
States I went with my friend Morgan and
we decided to go for the deal I think it
was like buy one get one 50 or buy one
get one free so so we did that she
dropped a pair and I got this pair and I
just think they're so cute and I love
the little belt buckle
so guys that is my entire ginormous huge
gigantic spring haul for you guys I hope

inspiration for things that you are
looking to purchase for your own
wardrobe for the springtime I'm
