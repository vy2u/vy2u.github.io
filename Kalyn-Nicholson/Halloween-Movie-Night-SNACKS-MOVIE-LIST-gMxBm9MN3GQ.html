for today's video it is the 15th yes it
is the 15th day of youtuber and I'm back
with love even though we're in youtuber
I figured I would upload a vlog on a
Sunday just because you know for old
times sake so as I'm sure you guys know
from the title I'm gonna be doing a
movie night / blog / treat / all the
good things in this video because it's
Friday the 13th and so what better night
to watch a bunch of scary movies I
invited a guide to join if he wants to
to be determined and pretty sure he's
napping right now but in the meantime
I'm actually going to run out to the
grocery store and grab all the
ingredients to make our DIY snacks these
you're like easy lazy hack snacks these
are not like a million ingredients I
made them one as easy as possible
because you know if you're having a
movie night odds are you probably don't
to spend the whole night cooking and -
because I'm lazy tonight
so so honk run down grab yourself a warm
beverage and let's do this I might
actually pick up wine - because you know
it's Friday and I'm not gonna lie guys I
swear all I've done for the last three
days is at a video so I wouldn't mind me
some Merlot you know let's do it cue the
grocery store
I'm actually sweating from that
embarrassing step to built for it I like
to use tapestries for this because one
their massive - they're light and three
it should because it makes it look cool
I got the wise idea today that I think
I'm going to use this reading lamp to
like hold this middle part of my fort up
and build the fort across from my TV to
my couch I'm hoping it's as epic as I'm
picturing it in my mind that's that
before anything begins while I like the
sweater I don't know why I'm not wearing
my most festive Friday the 13th of
sweaters especially if I'm having a
scary movie night I don't even know who
I am anymore
this is actually a lot harder than it
looks okay it's actually really sick in
here and now that we have a for it we
must fill it with as many blankets and
pillows as we could possibly find
disagree I travel the world oh yes this
is happening we have officially pimped
out afford bought bent paya that's
terrible you guys can think up a four
name for us pop it down below because
I'm obviously struggling so make a floor
it comfy Halloween inspired clothes no
most importantly food
look who's finally joined us drag them
get my dear I don't like snacks are
taken very seriously in this household
becoming snacks for dinner today we
really are having snacks or direction
hey those pizzas are good though eh
there later it looks like they're gonna
be gross new bite and you're like
they're good
the smell is like messed up good you
need to come try this this is insane you
gotta get like a Kiwi cluster it's like
desert pop one really good chunk of
cookie let's put on it hello today
so we are at that point in the night
into which we are picking a movie so
we've decided on it but I have made a
whole list and written it down of all
the Halloween movies that I'd like to
watch before October and they are as
follows scream Friday the 13th
Halloweentown do you like these scary
movies we should watch them like though
the ones where they make fun of scary
movies The Addams Family focus pocus and
I'm here before Christmas it which we're
watching tonight no one else we could
watch this jeepers creepers it's like
it's another old school scary movie but
it used to terrify me when I was a kid
of course like the standard Halloween
Charlie Brown it's the Great Pumpkin and
Casper I had to throw and scooby-doo we
can't forget to give you actually I
started tonight with scooby-doo while I
was making all those snacks so we're
gonna watch it I kind of want to watch
the original scream - maybe we could
fall asleep to that or can we sleep in
the fort oh yes this is my hard work and
labor this is like a this is the kind of
fort you could sleep in you know we just
need another blanket your mattress I'm
gonna make a little collective you know
I'll do something on like PicMonkey with
all of those movies and leave them down
below as well as put them on my Twitter
and until then we're gonna load up it
and watch it are we watching the new one
or the old one so I'm gonna be terrified
to adductors through her
and it won't stop sorry 2p6
a tuition way
through you
I throw you
you
better not drop that
through
vegan pumpkin spice marshmallows all
right so it is now actually Sunday
morning the clips you saw yesterday Greg
and I went for a run and then afterwards
I ended up editing a bunch of videos
filming a bunch of videos and pretty
much just working until dinner in which
I treated myself by ordering myself some
dinner and watching I watched some
Nashville stranger things which I'm
totally hooked on right now and I even
got the first Halloweentown in this
weekend has been full of very good TVs
and movies there's better lighting in
there let's let's let's relocate we're
coming to join you so I think as you
guys know for the last little bit I've
been doing a lot of work with you tober
and I haven't had a lot of time to just
kind of chill out and hang and I did
that last night and it was one of like
the most needed things all I wanted to
do was watch scary movies in the comfort
of my own home lately I feel like I've
had my head down and I realized
yesterday for the first time that it's
been a while since I've just kind of
like breathed the minute my eyes open I
feel like I'm racing the clock to get as
ahead as possible before my eyes shut
and I wake up and do it all over again
so the point guys the other day I
literally lifted up my arm and I was
like damn I haven't shaved my armpits in
a few days I think I have this
detrimental fear that I'm gonna wake up
one day and be like old and wrinkly and
my whole life will have passed me by
without you know seeing it or enjoying
it our lives are so open to everybody
else like yeah you'll have the pictures
and you'll have like the proof that
those things or those memories happened
but will you actually have like the top
10 memory I feel like lately I've been
on autopilot where I'm going through the
motions and I'm doing the things but I'm
so dead focused on what's next that I'm
forgetting what's presently happening
and I think that happens to a lot of us
and that it's not uncommon and it's
nothing to feel bad about but it's just
like I feel like last night was the
universe trying to remind me like chill
out and actually like make the memory
instead of just making you know the
image of the memory as weird as that
sounds which is why I didn't vlog last
night so I kind of wanted to end this
vlog with that little piece of Intel
that I kind of gained last night I guess
the new model I want to live by is I
want to stop trying to prove to
everybody else how much I love my life
and just focus on proving it to myself
if you spend your time convincing
yourself that your life is amazing the
way
is that even on your bad days there's so
much to be grateful for and not only are
you living authentically but you're also
living for you and not for other people
we digressed quite a bit there but I
just tying it back into last night
that's just like the Epiphany I had so
how does what I'm leaving you with today
so with that I'm gonna go throw on some
more stranger things and added a few
more videos I hope you guys enjoyed it
this little you know like a movie night
vlog and I'm going to leave that movie
list down below that I've made for you
guys and aside from that I love you guys
to the moon and back I hope you guys
enjoyed the 15th day of youtuber and I
will see all of you guys literally
tomorrow because you're I am filming
this outro on Sunday morning and this
video goes live tonight stop literally
seeing me in all of my glory today bye
