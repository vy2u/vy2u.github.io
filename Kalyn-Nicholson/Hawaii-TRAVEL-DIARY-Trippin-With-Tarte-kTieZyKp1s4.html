supposed to get down there pretty much
right now so we're kind of running

some wine and do tarot cards but we need
to go eat first because we've been awake
for like almost 24 hours I'm starving

good morning it is day two in Maui and
it has been a freaking incredible day so
far we woke up we went for a run at

spa had the most incredible massage it
was insane in our business head
downstairs we have to meet everybody
there's gonna be a scavenger hunt which
we like
we specifically wore comfortable clothes
so we're just about to head to that and
then afterwards we have some free time
maybe they'll hit the beach I don't know
what we're thinking we'll figure out
something ended up posting the Instagram
if you guys haven't seen it I'll post I
posted a bunch of stuff and I'm probably
going to post more my Hawaii trip I
posted a photo of my outfit yesterday
and someone mentioned that they wished I
had done like another pack with me slash
what I'm bringing on vacation I didn't
get a chance to film that before this
video but instead what I'm gonna do it's
any time we're heading to anywhere I'm
gonna ask my sister to take a quick
little up and down and I'll tell you
guys where everything I'm wearing is

terrible vlogger since I've been here

third day and technically our full final
day with the tart team here and I our
flights are pretty late tomorrow so
luckily we still can hang around and do
things tomorrow this is like the full
the full last day with everyone here
from tart here and I went to the beach
you guys saw some clips so he got him
some breakfast I went and did the yoga
class which was really fun it was out in
the Sun which even though I was like
roasting like sweating profusely and
areas you probably shouldn't sweat the
whole time I kept thinking about how I
was gonna be going home to snow and
winter so I was like sunlight baskin me
I just didn't care let the sweat happen
you know what did we call boob sweat
yesterday smooth sometimes you just got
a swoop though we just finished getting
ready I did a little get ready with me

lot more to insta stories lately ever

on the screen I don't even think I've
done that in this vlog yet but

we're either gonna go to the pool or the
beach we have a lunch at 1:00 but that's
still about two hours away I'm just
wearing this bathing suit today this is
from Zara I got it in the summertime and
it's actually a full piece and then the
same shorts as yesterday these are from
aloha Shoetique my sunglasses are from
Kwai my full face is tart because
tripping with her they actually gave me
a discount code which is really cool
because I told us that they've never
done a discount code before for the
shape tape so I got a discount code it
gives you 15% off you can use the
concealers for concealing and also for
contouring which is what I did then I'm
also wearing the foundation I'm wearing
the hydrating one though because I feel
like my skin needs a little bit more
hydration I probably should be drinking
more water haven't really been any keep
you guys more updated today that's my
goal I kind of wish we were talking
today that we had extended for another
day but
