for today's video I wanted to do a
little back-to-school inspired like
recipes video so for today's video I put
together five really easy back to school
lunches from Monday to Friday that are
all vegan they're all super healthy
they're all super nutritious and also I
guess even say if you're like trying to
stay pick for school or get fit for
school these are all perfect lunches to
that because they're all Whole Foods
relatively really healthy and yet look
literally I know no they met it there's
not one on all these animes in this
video I also make sure to make the
grocery list for this nice and easy
since if you are going to be doing a
remake of these Monday to Friday kind of
like meal prep for back-to-school a lot
of the same ingredients are reused to
all the different dishes so that you
don't have to spend a whack sum of money
like buying a bunch of stuff for a whole
bunch of different meals you guys want
five back to school healthy vegan
packable lunches and just keep watching
so for the first lunch I'm going to
making some rice paper rolls and I'm
just starting by picking up some basmati
rice but you can use quinoa or any other
filling that you like brown rice
anything work these all the ingredients
that I'm going to be using but I will
leave them down below as I said and then
I'm just going ahead and wetting the
rice paper wrap in order to make them
you know foldable and all that and then
I'm just adding all my ingredients so
rice some spring mix some carrots some
chickpeas salt pepper mustard and
sriracha again you guys can add any
toppings you like and you can go ahead
and add tofu and stuff too but I just
wanted to make mine super easy and super
healthy so those are all the toppings
that I chose change my way and then for
the snack portion of this meal I'm just
going to go ahead and use some toasted
garlic hummus and some baby carrots
along with a Clif Bar I am obsessed with
cook bars lately so if I'm not eating
naked bars it's usually the Clif bars
and then I just pack that all into one
Tupperware container making it easy to
pack and bring with you and for
Tuesday's meal I'm just going to go
ahead and use a spiralizer to spiralize
a full bikini and then I'm going to do
another half of a yellow zucchini on top
with a center side and then you can add
chickpeas and a bunch of roasted
vegetables I'm just roasting up some
mushrooms some onions and some green
peppers and then once that's done I'm
going to add some pasta sauce on top you
can choose any pasta sauce that is your
favorite but I just use some marinara
and then went ahead and put the roasted
vegetables on top and the nice thing
about this pasta is you can eat it cold
or warm it up once you get to school and
then just go with it I'm just going to
make some wraps since it is zucchini
pasta so it's probably not going to be
as filling so I'm just going ahead and
adding some of the vegetables we've
already been using into a wrap with some
hummus and making two of those popping
them into a container and bringing them
along for the snack portion of this meal
and then of course a naked bar because
you guys already know I'm obsessed with
these naked bars
so as for Wednesday's lunch I'm going
ahead and using these little buns but
you guys can use bread because I'm just
going to be making some sandwiches I'm
starting with some hummus some spring
mix and then some sprouts and cucumbers
this is kind of like a vegan take on a
suit humper and cream cheese sandwich
I'm adding some salt and pepper and a
little bit of mustard as well just to
give it a bit more flavor and I find the
hummus kind of sub for the cream cheese
portion and then as for the snack I'm
just going to make a big fruit bowl or
fruit salad by adding pineapple
strawberries and some blackberries into
a container and then adding another Clif
Bar just to give it a bit more substance
for this than that so that is it for
wednesday's lunch and for thursday i'm
starting off by clicking a bigger bowl
of basmati rice and then roasting up the
rest of the mushroom onion and green
peppers as well as whatever's left of
the chickpeas the zucchinis and then
using a bit of this frozen veg mix and
then once that's all roasted up I added
it on top of the rice and mix it up with
a little bit of salt pepper mustard and
then sriracha you guys are going to
notice I use a lot of mustard and
sriracha in this you guys can use
whatever you know dressings you like but
I just love this duo and it's also easy
because it's cheap and you don't have to
buy as much before groceries and then as
for the snack I'm going ahead and making
another fruit salad or a little fruit
side so I'm kind of bananas whatever was
left of the pineapple and as well as a
bunch of strawberries and then using
that as the snack along with another
naked bar
and as for Friday's lunch I'm going out
and using one of these multigrain buns
with some mustard spring mix and so
cliquey again you guys can use bread and
I just went over these really good if
you guys like turkey sandwiches or
you're just looking for a little bit
more substance to your sandwich and then
actually decide I'm going ahead and
making a big giant salad with tomatoes
onions and cucumber and then popping the
sandwich inside and as for the dressing
you guys can make your own but all I did
was take balsamic vinegar and then of
course mustard and sriracha and mix it
all up I promise he was actually super
good and then you can add that to your
salad and go ahead and eat your sandwich
and of course another Clif Bar because
this girl's hungry and so that concludes
all of the lunches that I had to show
you guys for Monday to Friday if you
guys want an other one of these then
just gums up or leave a comment down
below and other than that I'll see you
guys all in my next video bye guys
you are
I need to get to us all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
