you home oh oh oh loving you so so so so
the way I used to love you no I don't
wanna know no no no who's taking you
home oh oh oh my love in your soul so
it's all sauce the way I used to love
you
or I don't wanna know
you know again
baby every place I go reminds me of yeah
put on the horizon and out of reach you
want me to wait back here on the beach
you wanna stay together and be free
I shouldn't try to keep track so close
can't find my way back
wake up in so
everything
everything's entry
Lieut morning and what is up and welcome
back to my channel
for today's video I'm obviously doing a
morning routine which has already begun
we are currently in the midst of it and
I'm about to finish my first coffee of
the day and just finished doing my
morning reading and talked to you guys
before about my whole like fiction
nonfiction thing where I read a fiction
book and then I followed up with some
nonfiction kind of always reading two
books at once but lately I've actually
been playing around with three books
this one isn't really one that you have
to like physically read every single day
it's almost like little pep talks for
every day and the one today was very it
was fair and that does motivate yourself
you want to get something done today
don't think about all the reasons why
you should be doing it if you really
want to motivate yourself think about
how great you're going to feel when it's
done so that's that that's the mood of
today's morning routines I had been
requested so much for me to do an
updated summer morning routine so I
figured I would sit down film it with
you guys do it a bit of my old style and
mix it with my new like kind of coffee
chronicle style was vlogging it or
giving you guys like vlogging update
make it a little bit more real life you
know and so here we are getting pretty
into the morning I woke up at 6:45 this
morning I ended up picking up a Fitbit
watch last week one of my favorite
things about it is tracking my sleep so
when I went and looked at my sleep last
night I slept for about six and a half
hours which I've been trying to sleep
seven and a half and I only really fell
into a deep sleep like for a very short
period of time and woke up a lot
apparently last night so that's why I'm
just like slowly but surely trying to
bring my wake-up time back a little bit
earlier and a little bit earlier but
also going to sleep earlier took Bentley
for a long walk made myself my coffee
read through on my workout gear I have
my sports bra underneath here after I
finished the last bit of my coffee I'm
gonna go for a run my morning workout
which has been another thing that is
constantly kind of look forward to in
the mornings especially now that it's
summer so nice out in the mornings it's
the perfect temperatures you do workouts
like outside because it's not too hot
but it's not too cold so I like to run
along the water in the city come back do
my stretches and my workout and then
kind of get on with my day
nine times out
by the time that my work kind of winds
down for the day and things are starting
to settle up at the end of the day the
last thing I want to do is put on gear
and go work out find that when you do
the hardest things or the things are
gonna take the most of your energy like
in the morning or the most your like
brain capacity or what's the word I'm
looking for it's self discipline but it
makes it so that you don't need to like
you know stress yourself or almost tire
yourself out by using that self
discipline later on in the day no it's
just feel so like accomplished or
whatever because my bed's made my
workouts done I shower I get ready I can
accomplish anything after that now that
that's finished
imma tuck my books away put my mug in
the dishwasher and we'll just we'll just
do a nice brisk jog you know not too
overdone just enjoy yourself running his
therapy
upstream
use oxy
should I ask her to
about some place I used to go
don't mind my my red tomato face from my
run I just got back identified Kay in
about 26 minutes and 20 seconds and if
you guys were watching my running videos
back in the winter I had brought my run
down to under 25 and then after hurting
my knee I just I had to take so much
time off running that I've only started
getting back into it in the last few
weeks
decided to turn off like you know the
updates when it tells you when you've
hit a kilometer and all that fun stuff I
turn that off because I just want to
enjoy my Roenick run for the sake of
loving it because I started to kind of
get competitive with my timing I would
be lying if I said that like it wasn't
in the back of my mind that I kind of
wanna like everybody loves to see
improvement it's basically when I'm at I
guess I haven't been able to run my 5k
in 26 in a while that was that's a great
way to start the day lately what I've
been trying to do is after my run I just
change into something kind of loose to
let you know back knee problems because
I sweat like a beast I try not to put
anything too tight on top and I just
like to do at my yoga stretches before I
shower then my yoga is under the way but
also I find after a ride up my muscles
are super loose and warmed up I did a
bit of meditation when I sat in the
gazebo so I'm not sure if I feel like it
like if it comes up then maybe I'll sit
for a minute or two so let the yoga
b-roll begin
you
doesn't have to be a dramatic line
baby
don't know
havasu be your student
see
think about
all right e so I'm now on the cusp of
exiting my morning and entering my
actual day I find that because it's on
both my computer and my phone it's just
so much easier to have since I haven't
been home as much as I usually am I
don't know
everything I should be doing and all
that fun stuff on my phone and on my
laptop then I can pretty much take it
with me everywhere so today I have to do
some editing I need to shoot some promo
for a video and do emails by the time
that's done I'll be able to take up my
hair so this is another thing I've been
doing is either putting my hair into two
french braids or when it's damp putting
it into like a low bun in the back and
then after like an hour - you can take
the bun out and it just kind of has like
loose you know heatless waves for the
summer which has been nice so that I'm
not using heat on my hair I mean aside
from my bangs that I blow-dried but they
look a little funny so I kind of have
been tucking them back this is also
shamelessly what I like to check my
horoscope and then I kind of pick out
like a playlist and every now and then -
this is actually another really fun
thing I like to do is right before I
start my day after looking at what I do
have to do I kind of set a tone for the
day or I'll go only hard it and just
kind of surf through and create a little
mini mood board for the day
at - new playlist one of them is sleepy
summarize and one of them is summer
sweat and summer sweat that was what I
ran to this morning and oh my god
it is mMmmm I think I'll put it live
before I put my morning routine up so
you guys will be able to listen to it
and all that I usually play my new
playlist so I'm gonna put that one on
and then I go and we heart it and
obviously we're not gonna be able to
make dream boards every single day if
we're being realistic but I like to make
a little mini dream board for the day on
be hard it based on the things I would
need to get done based on the kind of
things that are inspiring me right now
I'll go through and like heart three or
four photos that in conjunction with a
new playlist and then just like starting
off my day I feel like I just feel super
inspire
and just like pumped up and ready to go
you know so there you guys have it that
has been at my most recent summer
morning routine I know that this morning
routine isn't something that is
necessarily realistic for everybody
because I do work from home so I kind of
get to go on my own timeframe and even
today because I was filming it it took
me longer to go through my morning
routine than usual but that said I feel
like if you can just find one thing
every morning to do that makes you feel
good and that sets the tone of your day
then I feel like that should just be
where you kind of create the route of
your morning routine and then build
everything out around it I like to do a
few things that make me feel good every
morning like I try to work out every
other day or about five times a week I
tried to get yoga done every single
morning I try and do a meditation of
every single morning and I try and read
every single morning but not every
morning I'm able to do all of those
things not every morning I'm able to do
like a little mini wee hearted dream
board or whatever and not every morning
I'm able to kind of take my time and
just like make myself a shape or pick
out a cute outfit sometimes I'm more
racing out the door or grabbing just
like a protein bar or barely doing my
makeup because I'm just gonna be sitting
at home for the day or whatever so I
guess what I'm trying to say is that
every morning isn't exactly like this
and also to that I think that it is
important to try and have a productive
set-up morning but I also think it's
important to kind of go with the flow be
realistic with our lives and with
ourselves and if there's things that you
want to do on a daily basis that you
know you don't have time for in the
morning then do try working out at night
or try doing your reading at night or
try I don't know doing your meditations
in your yoga at night but just find ways
to work in to your day to day the things
that just make you feel really really
good and really happy and yeah that's my
stop be ending with that I'm gonna stop
and let you guys go if you guys enjoyed
it this vlog / b-roll mixed together
style warning your teen then just thumbs
up and let me know down below and I can
do a night routine as well cuz I'm at I
don't see you guys all in my next video
