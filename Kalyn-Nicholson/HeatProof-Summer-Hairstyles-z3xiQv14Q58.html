took a shot love for the first time try
together in Sun two days
hey guys so today I'm going to be
showing you some key proof sweat proof
summer hairstyles so for this first one
you're basically just wanting to make a
very deep side part into your hair and
then we're going to be using that front
section of our head to French braid
right back to the very back of our heads
you'll see me through this year I'm
going to speed this up because it's
pretty self-explanatory just continue to
French braid as you make your way back
here down your head
then once it done pull it back and then
pull back all the rest of your hair with
it as high as you can on top of your
head or wherever you guys like to put
your hair as a ponytail or a bun now you
could use a ponytail but I decided to do
a messy bun with this one so I went
ahead and clawed my fingers through and
then made a bun and then I'm just
tucking in all the loose strands and
this is the final result it's all off
your face and it's perfect for if it's
hot outside or if you're sweating all
day this is the perfect hairstyle so
moving on to the next one you're going
to want to section forward a little bit
of your bangs or fringe and then right
behind that take a section of hair and
begin doing a twist so you just divide
it into two pieces and begin twisting
and I just added pieces to the twist as
I went along and again I'm going to
speed this up because it's pretty
self-explanatory
so then go ahead and bobby pin the twist
into the back of the head and then
taking a hair from the opposite side of
the head cover up where you put the
bobby pin and then go ahead and take the
rest of your hair and do a normal braid
right down the side
so this is what the hairstyle looks like
when it's all done it's all off your
face again this is perfect for like for
going out for lunch on a patio or
anything of the sort
it's totally heat proof it's not going
to go frizzy and it gets all your hair
out of your face so that was this
hairstyle and probably my favorite so
moving on to the next one I know I've
shown you guys this on a couple times
but it just fits so perfectly with this
theme so I'm just using a floral
headband and I'm taking sections of my
hair and wrapping it around the back of
the headband to make myself a little
half do like half up to half up half
down so you just continue doing this
with sections of hair until you have
enough hair off your face and the end
result is really really cute
when you baby
so as you can see this hairstyle turns
out very feminine and it worked out
really well with the floor headband I've
never done it with a floral headband
before and it's perfect for those hot
days where you just want to keep your
hair off your face but still have some
of it down so moving on to the next and
last hairstyle we're going to be doing a
ponytail for this one so on each side of
your head you're going to want to pull
out a section around from your ear to
your temple and just completely braid
that kind of direction in it towards the
back of your head go ahead and do the
exact same thing on the other side of
your head and be sure that once you
secure the braid into place to pull on
it and tug on it just add a little bit
more volume once done go ahead and pull
all of your hair up into a normal
ponytail and then add each braid to the
ponytail and secure it into place so
obviously this is a cute little spin on
the normal ponytail and once you have it
in and secured pull out the two little
elastics that you use to hold the little
braids into place and then you're done
so I find this hairstyle is very chic
for a ponytail and it keeps all the hair
off your face so if it's sweaty or hot
outside it's good to go and it will lock
in place so I hope you guys enjoyed all
4 of these heat proof sweat proof
hairstyles and I'll see you guys all in
a future video
