my channel for today's video
it is the eighth day of Christmas
meaning I can't believe this but there's
literally like a week left until it's
Christmas it came so fast this year I
can't handle it so for today's came this
video I took on your guys's request I
got a few of you guys asking me to do a
holiday themed in part menteur since
I've literally decked my place out like
the North Pole so I love doing holiday
apartment tours because right after the
holidays right around New Year's I do
such a big like gut of my apartment
where I clean it all out and get rid of
so much junk content a video that I have
coming for January but in the meantime
it means around Christmas I can like put
up as much stuff everywhere as possible
without feeling like so overwhelmed by
everything being so busy I don't know if
I'm making any sense but it just makes
it better so that when you go to clean
everything off for the new year it's
just like such a fresh clean slate so if
you guys want to see my North Pole Santa
Claus Christmas themed apartment tour
then just keep watching so walking it in
to my apartment we're just going to hop
skip jump over the recycling and pretend
that wasn't there but as per usual we've
got the closet I put a mic on this time
guys so the sound doesn't suck we have
the same seating area to put on boots
and stuff this is gonna bother me okay
we go home we still have the same
seating area to put on boots and my
skulls and the next as per usual II have
the kitchen if you guys have seen my
last apartment tours I'm not gonna go as
in-depth about the basic stuff oh we
really care if it is the Christmas dish
am i right oh my oven right now I have
this candle called Christmas morning I
got it from home cents and it actually
smells like Christmas morning chestnuts
and coffee and all that's good about
Christmas and then I also got this from
home cents as well it's
more wine dear just my little Christmas
towel they're kind of dirty so I've been
baking a lot I mean I could have cleaned
them but this is a real apartment to
where I have just my coffee machine my
little coffee station I think actually
this has changed since last time I used
to keep mugs here now I just keep like
stevia um little spoons and a Starbucks
cup and hit me with your best pot I
bottle of wine
at all times because you never know when
you're gonna need it in here I just have
Bentley's dog treats and then there's
nothing in this one this one's empty if
you guys have ideas of things I could
put in here let me know maybe I'll fill
it with cookies and I want to get more
of e string lights they're actually from
the dollar store and string them all the
way around but I feel like by the time
that actually happens Christmas will
probably be over and then walking out of
the kitchen here I just have board and a
nice two list
this is like the millionth time I've
told the story but Maggie and I still
list for my restaurant and I just have
my but first coffee candle on there and
then I also totally forgot to show you
guys this little gingerbread dude this
is my soap right now I'm gonna make
gingerbread cookies tonight so that is
the holiday kitchen tour and I finally
got rid of the dead sunflowers that were
in here and put a little poinsettia that
my Nana gave me in there instead the
rest is still the same I just have
journals and books and my old vintage
cameras you know what that's actually
something I need to keep collecting I
have a goal that by the time I own a
house I want to have just like shelves
in my dining room or kitchen of just all
old vintage cameras so those are the
collection that I have now maybe one day
down the road when I actually buy a
house that can be a reality next to that
I just have Bentley's toys under the toy
box in there all of my records in this
little record holder and then my little
record player I don't have any Christmas
records I feel like that would be a
really good idea and then my lamp from
Ikea and my couch we have talked about
the whole couch situation I believe
I got a new coach a couple months ago
and I went crazy decorating my couch
this year blankets and pillows I feel
like in the winter it's socially
acceptable to have literally five
blankets on your couch but leaving you
recognize you I didn't even know you're
in there so on my couch both of these
are from society6 this blanket is from
Walmart the blanket that Bentley is
adorably curled up in is from indigo
this is from HomeSense this is also from
HomeSense and the pair of them I don't
know so festive
and then this like it is from Victoria
Secret this one I believe I got for
Christmas so I don't even actually
remember where that one's from pillows
from indigo this pillow is from society6
and that is a sweet potato bone if you
guys are curious and then I was gonna
switch this out but I ended up believing
it cuz I thought it fit the theme nicely
and my coffee table has had some
adjustments so the actual coffee table
tray itself is from home scents and then
on it I just put my Taylor Swift book I
got this from indigo last year and it's
just like red and festive on there I
have my campfire donut with a lighter
because I've been waiting this every
single night and then the same plants
that I had before just like a little
fake cactus and stuff and then off to
the side of that I just have my coaster
which is actually the lid from a candle
that I got from HomeSense
this is the meditations that I've been
doing every day I actually ordered this
off of Urban Outfitters it's called
pillow thoughts and it's just a bunch of
: those are the books in the Costa very
unintentionally they fit the black white
and red 5 and of course my TV stand and
station I feel like I should have had a
Christmas movie home for this next we
have my TV stand the only things that
really changed on it is over down at the
bottom I added this little deer that I
had last year also currently noticing
that I needed to just that's just
pretend we didn't see that I just have
this little bird that I got from Walmart
I believe a three-week fun scented
candle for when you just want to like
you want the candle light but you don't
want the mixture of a million cents fine
right now
all the candles for you guys so that it
would look cute in here and then this
giant like Birchwood thing and how can
we forget above the TV I have Bentley
stocking and my stocking Bentley's is
the red one that has fur that actually
looks like Bentley's fur and mine is the
white one they're both from indigo as
well moose guy who's always chill in
there but he's extra festive this time
of year past that I just have my mirror
and my Christmas tree I actually had to
get a new Christmas tree this year so I
picked one up from Rona it's the kind
that's like green but it has it's like
fake snow on it so it kind of looks like
black and white from far away which is
100% why I got it and then all of my
decorations some of them are from last
year and some of them are new like this
little sock monkey I've had him pop in
and out of videos for so long kind of
did like a rustic vibe
I didn't even intentionally need to I
found the ribbon when I was at ROH not
picking up the Christmas tree and then I
had old ornaments like this guy and I
bought some new ornaments like these
ones and they all just somehow happen to
come together so that's kind of how I
decorated my tree it's kind of got like
logs and animals and little trucks like
this guy and it's like black white and
red and then at the bottom of my
Christmas tree this I also got from Rona
this little
like a tree farmtruck this elf is from
the dollar sermon and I got it from me
last year for Christmas and Bentley
likes to play with it so I just leavin
though I switched out my flowers if you
guys remember they were orange at fall
times so I switch these out for white
roses I still have my Harry Potter wand
because Harry Potter isn't just a fall
thing it's a year-round thing my near
which I have string legs around all the
time but again it's one of those things
that just feels extra right and festive
around the Christmas time and on the
other side at the bottom of my tree I
just have my onesie it's like my elf
onesie if you guys have seen me wear
before and Yahtzee which I bought not
much has changed over here I put this
little first thing on here but this is
where my laptop chills and charges some
books and just like random miscellaneous
stuff my youtube button finally came in
so I just put it there for now and my
society6 prints like art prints that I
haven't changed yet either
and outside the only thing that's
changed is I actually strung lights
around the banister so I'll give you
guys a night view really quick just to
show you guys what it looks like at
night so then walking in to my bedroom I
changed a few things in here I'll give
you guys a once-over and then we'll get
into detail so walking in the first
thing here is my floor pillows it ends
up moving around the apartment quite a
bit this is where it lives and then I
have my fireplace with more string
lights those string lights are from
Urban Outfitters I'm not gonna lie guys
don't buy them they stop these canvases
are from society6 I haven't changed
those but what I have changed is what's
on my fireplace eyesore right now I have
the menorah if you guys didn't know this
Greg is actually Jewish and this is my
first menorah over here I just have the
two candles I got in the fall time
they're like the pre-trip ones from
Urban Outfitters this is a candle my
aunt Carrie got me forever ago and then
on the other side I have my Noel candle
my winter candy apple and my little
crystal which isn't even lit I feel like
we need to we're just pulling out all
the possible cozy lighting in this
apartment or so that is everything
that's on my fireplace I just keep my
naughty and nice slippers with just a
little carpet is from Walmart I have
another mirror here yeah I have my dream
thing which also lights up and then as
from my nightstand
this lamp thing this is from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond and it has like a charging
station which is amazing or my family
from lamp CCA hotel
I have flannel from Bath and Body Works
burning this little dear guy is from
Walmart as I couldn't get rid of
Valentine so instead I just put a Santa
hat on her to make her Christmas Eve and
then as for my bed a few pillow
adjustments have been made just have the
heated blanket slowly for the fact that
it makes it more fun to get cozy and
like in blankets
Bentley uses it all the time I keep it
on during the day and then my pillows
this one is truly me this one I just got
from society6 it came in today I have my
1975 pillow which is also from society6
if this pillows from indigo and this
pillow is from H&amp;amp;M and last but not
least I ended up moving my little
Christmas tree that I got from Amazon
into the corner of my room because it's
just so cute and when you look at my
bedroom as a whole now it's just like
extra festive and then I just have my TV
I have my guitar I have my dreamcatcher
and then this stuff is all the same as
my normal coming back out of my bedroom
no evil them to my closet slash office
slash many things so first things first
I got like a big giant parcel from
two-faced guys they sent roller blades
like I truly have just invited you into
my apartment without actually cleaning
it much so bear with me this is the mess
that is all of my parcels and stuff that
have come in for the new year and had a
box of new Co stuff I have to do work on
what I call my hot mess but it's like
this room is kind of like my office so
that's my excuse he is like the neediest
dog ever he needs to be in the same room
as me at all times one of years so I
have to have a good dog bed in every
room I did like a full closet tour
before so if you guys want to see it I
will link it up on the screen but not
much has changed in terms of my closet
since then and then over here I just
have my desk area this is where I get
all my work done I will bring my laptop
in here too I'm now burning my mahogany
balsam in here you guys see what I mean
when I said it I lit all my candles
because I was inviting you guys over it
looks pretty but I'm kind of smells like
a cluster of Christmas but that's okay
and as for this bathroom guys can we
just witness this shower curtain it's so
epic from society6 it says Merry
Christmas you filthy animal something I
vividly remember from being a kid was my
grandparents always having a Christmas
shower curtain and they would switch it
out every year and I just remember that
being like one of my favorite things
so this is gonna be my new shower
curtain that I switch out every year but
I got these letters when I went to tiff
then I have my shower speaker or like
just the speaker I use in general I
switched the tablet for a black towel my
little Eiffel Tower have another candle
burning we have vanilla coconut this is
what I keep my little clip on but it's
actually just this like light-up tree
that I got from in the ghosts I'm moving
on walking back out the last room that I
have to show you guys is the final
bathroom so this bathroom the only
things I really changed out I put a new
candle here that I got from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and then I have another one of
those light-up trees that I got from
indigo so that is in here as well but
yeah which means that is it for my
holiday slash Christmas apartment tour
the last thing I have to show you guys
is my little popcorn maker and I
actually use this a lot now and it has a
light so it just that's the cosy
lighting of the apartment so that is it
that completes my holiday slash
Christmas apartment tour and all of the
little changes and festivities that I've
added to the place really quick I'll
give you guys a night view of my
apartment this is what my apartment
looks like at nighttime with all the
lights and all the candles and other
