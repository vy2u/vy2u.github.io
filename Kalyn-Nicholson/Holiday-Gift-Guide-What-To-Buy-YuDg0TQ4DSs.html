with you guys to bring some Christmas
spirit honestly I've been getting so
excited for Christmas it is so insane
I've literally been listening to
Christmas music all day I didn't make an
8 tracks playlist but there is a
specific 8 tracks playlist I've been
listening to that has like really really
good Christmas songs so I'll leave a
link to that down below if you guys are
looking for some Christmas music with
that said today I'm going to be showing
you guys a mini little like Christmas
gift guide so without further ado I'm
quickly just going to make a very very
very quick disclaimer that if you are my
mother my father if your cura or Jacob
or any of my friends stop watching this
video because all of your gifts well a
lot of your gifts are going to be in
this video so you are going to spoil the
heart of Christmas and my inner Santa
Claus so please stop watching this video
or else I will be very very angry and I
will be able to tell by the look on your
guys's faces whether or not you watch
this video so exit out now I really want
to show you guys just like a mini gift
guide of just some things that I have
purchased for my friends and family for
this Christmas year and they're all
gonna be like all different types of
prices and for different types of people
so hopefully this will give you guys
some good ideas for anyone that you guys
might be shopping for this Christmas
season so I'm gonna start out with the
most expensive and then move down to the
cheapest so whatever price range you
have for whoever you're shopping for
this year there will be something in all
different types of prices so one of the
first things I picked up for the
Christmas season for gifts and it's
something that is really really good and
versatile for whether it's for males
females the age whatever I picked up one
of these black web sound pebble portable
wireless speakers so this was from
Walmart it was about $30 I believe it's
29.97 now it's got bluetooth with
chargeable batteries all that fun stuff
and what you can do is put this anywhere
and Bluetooth your phone to it Bluetooth
and iPod to it a computer to it and it
is a speaker so you can use that for
your computer you can use it for playing
music in your room and you can use this
for someone that likes to travel a lot
there's a bunch of different ways you
can use this and like I feel like this
is one of those gifts that like you
could pretty much gift to anybody and it
was only $30 so it's a lot cheaper than
like a lot of the portable speakers that
are out there right now and then this
next
one is more so for like maybe a family
member like a mum or sister or a good
friend and something that we picked up
for a mum this year when I was up in
Toronto was a set of Victoria's Secret
pajama pants and I actually picked up a
set of these for myself too because I
find them really really comfy but it's
the dreamer flannel PJs set and I feel
like I mean I'm just someone that I love
getting pajamas on Christmas I feel like
it's just a tradition and having a new
set of pajama pants for the winter it's
just so cozy so this is like the
matching set and we got hers and like
the grey I like kind of cheetah print
because my mom loves like animal print
stuff so next this is another gift that
I feel like could be for both guys and
girls and like that like the age
difference could definitely vary but
something that I got my roommate and my
best friend is this smartphone projector
so I got this from chapters and indigo
this was $30 and basically what you do
is you inside is like a box and you can
build this little projector screen and
you put your phone inside it's got a
slot for the charger so you can
constantly be charging your phone while
doing it and then it projects it a
little bit bigger onto the wall so this
is the gift that I have for my roommate
because she doesn't have a TV in her
room so this is gonna make it so that
she can use her phone to watch Netflix
but instead of having to watch it on her
small iPhone screen she can watch it and
project it onto the wall and I think
it's just really cool you could get this
for your boyfriend as well or girlfriend
and maybe theme this around like a date
night you could like put this in like
put this in like a bowl of popcorn or
maybe like attach a bag of popcorn to
this and like have it like date night
themed or something but it could be
really really cute and it's just it's a
really cozy gift and I love the idea of
it being like a projector I think that's
just so like kind of different and
really funky so this is something I just
picked up from Walmart it's one of the
Conair body benefits foot bath with heat
and vibration so last year we picked our
mom up one of these because she's
someone that likes to do a lot of
pedicures she does them were her friend
I believe it was 29.97 so it was only
$30 which you might think it's a lot
more expensive but it isn't it can be
perfect for like a mom a sister a best
friend if you wanted to have like a
girls night or like a grandma or whoever
your aunt FEMA gifts or idea around that
as well maybe throw in like a couple of
cute little nail polishes and like a
little mini pedicure set or you could
gift it to your best friend and have
like a girls night planned with it or
something like that but it's actually a
lot more affordable than you might think
and the last one at least for this
category is the 12 T's of Christmas now
there's a bunch of different things you
could get like this but I got this from
David's tea so this is what it looks
like inside it has 12 different types of
tea to try and it's just really fun
really easy and really cool for somebody
that might be like a tea connoisseur or
just someone that really really likes
teas or something like a place like
David's tea you could go and pick up
their favorite teas or get them a bunch
like this or they can try a whole whack
of them or if you wanted to switch this
into something a little bit more Dada
related my dad really likes hot
chocolates so another idea you could do
is make like a DIY version of this and
go and pick up like a bunch of different
flavors of hot chocolates find a cute
little box and then take or go to the
dollar store and get little containers
like this and maybe do like the 12 hot
chocolates of Christmas or you could
just pick up something like this and
gift it this is about $30 but it gives
you so much different types of tea and
the girls set about 4 to 5 cups of tea
for each one so this is a really awesome
gift idea to do too so as for the $25
category there's a few things that I
picked up for this one
one of the first things I picked up was
from Plummer and it's one of the like
for him cologne set so this is really
good for like a boyfriend maybe a
brother or dad we picked this up for our
dad and it gives you with a chance to
try three different adidas cologne so
there was a bunch of different ones
there and a bunch of different cologne
sets that you could try but this is a
really good idea that for only 20
dollars you're giving them like three
different colognes but yeah and they had
like a bunch of female perfume ones too
at Walmart so this is a really good idea
super easy and who doesn't like cologne
and perfume my sister specifically said
she told me to tell my parents that she
wanted a really nice journal this year
and I just didn't tell my parents and
picture why not for her myself because
I'm a big journal er so this is a
journal I got her it is from chapters it
was only 20 dollars it's like a really
really nice material it's not leather
but it's kind of like this like spongy
material it's really cool and in the
dark you can't really see I'm I don't
know if you guys can tell on camera but
in the dark writing it says do more of
what makes you and then in gold it says
happy and it's navy blue I like
because I know she really likes
navy-blue and she likes like she doesn't
like something that's too crazy or like
girly or tacky or anything like that so
I knew she would like this one I think
this is like the perfect size for a
journal this is like exactly the same
size as my journal next in the $25
category I picked up this so it's funny
because when my sister started dating
her boyfriend our family became more of
like a game board family so every year
we always all get them like a new game
board and then when we all go up we'll
play it so my sister's boyfriend he's so
smart and he really likes like strategy
and all of that kind of stuff so I
figured for Christmas this year I picked
him up the game board of risk which is
like kind of like a double whammy
because it's kind of a gift for all of
us from when we go up then we can all
play this game it was $25 at one I don't
know if you guys remember playing them
as kids but like they had operation
pictionary they had so many and I took
me forever to choose one so if you're
looking for something fun for the family
or some maybe for like your friends if
your friends like to host game nights or
anything like that I would definitely
recommend maybe going to someplace like
Walmart or Target and checking out their
game board and the last for the $25
category is I picked up this here it's
like a travel mug from David's tea again
you could gift these things together if
you're spending a little bit more money
you could gift these things as a pair
and it comes with the tea steeper inside
use the lever on the side here and it
like drops it into the tea and then
steeps it so if you know somebody that
really likes steeped tea or if you know
somebody that just travels around a lot
and brings their coffee and tea with
them travel mugs are always a really
good way to go so as for the 15 to $10
category I would say I have like the
most things to show you guys from this
category so I'm just gonna jump in so
one of the things I picked up was the
wreck this journal' now this is
definitely something that I would love
to get I've always wanted a wreck this
journal' and I just never have gotten
around to getting one this is only $15
and basically if you've never heard of a
wreck this journal' I feel like a lot of
people have but it just like in the it
tells you like a bunch of cool things to
do for all different pages and like you
basically just like destroy this journal
in a bunch of different ways it's really
cool I don't know I think these are so
fun
definitely for like the artsy type or
people that like to journal or write or
do a bunch of stuff like that and it's
just like a really good cheap
alternative you could get this and like
get them like a set of like
pens are like colored pens or something
like that and it's just like a really
easy gift but really fun and of course
what would winter time be without mugs
so this mug was only 15 dollars I got it
off of society6 I kind of themed my
latest DIY after this mug but this one
is actually made and printed and it's
got the Harry Potter glasses in scar and
it says don't let the muggles get you
down but I did go on society6 to get
quite a few gifts this year they have
really awesome like cell phone cases
mugs pillows like a lot of personalized
stuff and they have really cool designs
and prints that you can't find in stores
it's where I got my phone case like the
forest phone case and I also got a phone
case for my roommate that said a pug
tato and it's a potato that looks like a
pug it's just a bunch of random funny
things and then maybe to go with the mug
or to go with one of the $25 gifts you
could always just go to like someone's
favorite coffee shop or favorite tea
place and pick up maybe some of like
loose leaves tea or pick up like a bag
of their favorite coffee every year my
mom gets us like a nice bag of this
cooks coffee and it's like super rich
and just like luxurious coffee it just
tastes so good so you could always go
and pick them up like their favorite bag
of tea or maybe give them like a new
taste out like a try at a new tea or put
this like right inside the mug if you're
spending a little bit more than 15 get
like maybe like a $5 bag of coffee or
tea and then put it inside of a mug and
gift the gift like that and then a gift
that we got our mom just sticking on
like the whole mug idea
another gift that we got our mom is one
of the Starbucks mugs so I don't know if
you guys have been there this year but
they have like a bunch of really cool
different mugs they have travel mugs
mugs like this a bunch of different ones
they have like little mini espresso ones
so this is the one that we got our mom
and we're gonna give it to her obviously
with the pajamas which are also cheetah
print another thing you could do if you
know that someone is a super big
bookworm like my cousins a bookworm I'm
a bookworm my sister's a bookworm I went
and picked up my sister this book called
winter kill the funny thing about it is
that Carrie and I like to go to the book
store all the time so we always go and
look at books and I picked up winter
kill the last time we went and she was
gonna buy it but then she didn't because
she ended up buying another book and
then now she's not buying any books
until after Christmas because she's
spending her money on Christmas gifts so
I know she's not gonna go back and buy
this book but I also know that she
really really wanted it so
I went back and grabbed it for her this
book was only ten dollars so if you know
someone's like a big into books or loves
to read you could go to a book store
find a book they don't have and get it
in paperback and that's only ten dollars
and again you could gift it with a mug
you could gift it with tea you could get
make a DIY bookmark from like my last
video and make it like a little bit more
personal but there's a bunch of
different ways by spending only like ten
twelve dollars you could do a couple fun
DIYs with this and then another thing I
picked up was this candle I went to
HomeSense and looked at all the
different candles they had and this is
someone you could get a guy or a girl
because this the smell of this candle is
tobacco leaf and vet aveer I don't know
if that's the actual word but it is it
smells like more of like a warm cologne
type of smell so if you know like a dad
my dad likes to burn candles sometimes
this is definitely more of like a manly
scent but I'm also somebody that loves
the smell of like colognes and stuff so
you can get this for a girl or a guy and
this candle was from home sensor only
$7.99 and I like it cuz it's different
and just fun and you could give this
with other things or just buy it on its
own maybe for like a staff party or
something and then one last item for
this category I picked up Jurassic Park
on DVD I know nobody watches DVDs
anymore everybody has Netflix or watches
things online but I think there's
something fun about having DVDs
especially for people that maybe drive
up to cottages and such like Ryan's
cottage doesn't have Wi-Fi or anything
like that so we always use DVDs there
and also just my sister and her
boyfriend they still collect DVDs all of
the time and I know they didn't have
Jurassic Park so for ten dollars I
picked this up from Walmart and DVDs
because nobody buys them anymore they're
super cheap if you know something that
likes to travel a lot obviously and
can't use Wi-Fi or go to cottages that
don't have cable or Wi-Fi pick up like
DVDs and fun stuff like that for only
like ten dollars and then another way
you could do this is pick one I pick a
movie put it inside us like a little
popcorn container maybe put like a
little bag of popcorn seeds and some
candies and stuff like that and theme a
whole date night and then put it in like
a pretty little package you could put
like DIY like love coupons and stuff
like that and make like a whole complete
gift for your boyfriend or girlfriend
for like under $15 that's another way
you could do it as well
and then ask for the $5 and under
category there's a few things I have to
show you guys from here so one thing you
could do is always pick up somebody's
favorite magazine and this is upside
down so I'm just gonna flip that right
side up so this is the my dad's favorite
magazine is men's health so we always
pick one up from him every year and he
always just like keeps him on his coffee
table so next year moment for 497 I
believe it was we picked up this little
thing from Walmart it is a Burt's Bees
the first one is a litte lemon butter
cuticle cream and the other one is the
Burt's Bees replenishing lip balm and
pomegranate so we picked us up for our
mom this is a really good like stocking
stuffer if you're making a stocking for
somebody or maybe again doing like a spa
essentials or just like a magazine and
something small on the side you could
pick up something like this our mom
really likes his chopsticks it has a
little bit of pigment to it and then she
always does again like I told you guys
like manicures and pedicures so like
cuticle cream is like a great idea for
her as well and then from home scents
again I picked this up for $5.99 it's a
cow mug and to be a hundred percent
honest to the guys I don't want to keep
it for myself so they had this at home
since it's the cutest thing in the world
is just a little cow and they have a
bunch of really cute mugs that are
totally different so you can find some
really cute ones there too and then
again another idea to kind of throw in
with this or on its own as we pick this
up from Walmart and these are the cafe
cup interchangeable like Curie cup so if
you know someone that has a Keurig like
myself or anyone like that these are
gonna keep a bunch of the K Cups out of
landfill and then you can buy like their
favorite coffee or something and then
they all they have to do is fill up
those little K cups and put it inside
and then these are refillable so nothing
gets thrown out nothing ends up in a
landfill or anything like that so you
could gift these together for like $10
or do them kind of separately but you
could always go with like a coffee theme
maybe throw a book in and then again you
could put like a little lipgloss or like
a nail polish inside or something like
that so again just really easy simple
gift ideas that are all under like six
to five dollars so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little mini gift guide idea
let me know down below if you decide to
buy any of these ideas for your friends
or family or anything like that and I
will see all of you guys in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
