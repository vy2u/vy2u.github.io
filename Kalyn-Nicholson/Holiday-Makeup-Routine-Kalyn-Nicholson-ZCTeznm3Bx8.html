hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm going to be
showing you guys my go-to holiday makeup
that I've been wearing in my vlogs and
such it was asked that I do a tutorial
for you guys so I'm going to go through
it all for you all of these things are
cruelty free so it is a cruelty free
look and I will leave all of the
products that I'm using down below in
the description long story short I'm
going about my normal foundation routine
as always I use the Too Faced foundation
as well as my Tarte Amazonian clay brow
but as for eyeshadow I'm going in with
this Too Faced holiday eggnog latte at
palette it's one of my absolute
favorites and actually smells like
eggnog which is just an added bonus
so yeah I'm just kind of creating a
neutral smokey eye and using the iced
coffee which has a bit of shimmer on the
outside and then I'm just spraying with
my NYX fitting primer spray and this
using the metallic color all over the
lid and then on the palette itself there
is a cream color and it is super
pigmented so I'm using that as a
highlight under my brow bone as well as
in my inner tear-duct since I didn't
want to do too much shimmer and then
just touching up on the crease so I'm
using my Born This Way by Too Faced
concealer as a highlight and then just
stippling that all into place and
touching up any problem areas like the
bags under my eyes since I was super
super sick so I'm just touching that up
to create a super defined highlight and
then going in with my Kat Von D shade of
light and setting that into place
so to finish off the shadow I'm going
back in with iced coffee and lining my
lower lash line as well as touching up
the crease before I go back into my Kat
Von D shade and light palette and
contour my face now I like to use the
medium brown for this and then just
build up on it you can do as big of a
contour as you like I like to make it
pretty defined contour my cheekbones and
my forehead and then I like to take a
smaller brush and do the same with my
nose making sure to blend it all in so
as always to finish off the look I'm
going in with my better than sex by Too
Faced mascara no this is not being
sponsored by Too Faced
as you guys know it's just my favorite
makeup brand so I'm going in with two to
three coats of that and while I'm
letting the first coat dry this has been
my absolute favorite go-to red holiday
lip it is the NYX suede it's like a
lipstick but it is a liquid lipstick it
goes on so nicely guys I highly
recommend it so this is just the red
color in their suede and then to top off
the look I'm just going back in with one
more coat of the mascara to finish it
all off so that is it for my go-to
holiday look recently I know you guys
have been requesting this so I figured I
would put it up here since it's a super
easy makeup look and it's cruelty free
so I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see
you guys all in tomorrow's video
how friends it was class to meet them
but I hope I never see them again I know
it breaks your heart go to the city and
I broke down car for years no calls now
you're looking pretty alone too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
