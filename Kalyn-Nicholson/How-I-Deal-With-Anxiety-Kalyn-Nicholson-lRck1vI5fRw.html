thing bags AG happy sunday and welcome
back to my channel for today's video I'm
going to be doing a bit of a different
style or different themed vlog JS video
is actually going to be all based on
anxiety so obviously I've done a lot of
videos on my channel before that have
kind of been you know centered around
anxiety I've done coffee talks about
oils are all things that I'll link down
below I've logged on the weekend Greg
and I actually went to Blue Mountain we
went skiing let me backtrack I'm just
packing up my bags right now to head to
Blue Mountain it's actually Greg's
birthday this week and I decided to get
SSL Lodge at a ski resort called Blue
Mountain it's about two hours from
Toronto going there tonight and then we
get to ski tomorrow you actually have a
two hour road trip ahead of us I'm Neil
prepped us some food because if you guys
watched last week's blog you'll know
that I used my takeout night last night
for my one-year anniversary of being in
Toronto so instead tonight I decided to
cook us some food to eat before we head
hit the road you pack up my bag and I
need to get to Greg's
yeah don't doubt yourself and now to
brother to artist for help when you see
me
baby
I'm not gonna lie guys I kind of thought
no you're good
I'm not good
there was actually something that ended
up happening during that tram I haven't
skied since 2006 okay it's been a long
time as my dad said 2006 was a good was
a good year for skiing we went down like
a very chill Hill twice before we moved
over to this bigger hill and I said to
Gregg as we were going up on the ski
lift I was like I I don't think I can do
this I got a little scared it's getting
good at it but I mean I don't think on
down the hill twice so I wasn't fully
comfortable yet it's hilarious to think
about now but I end up doing the hill I
freak out halfway down the hill think
about skiing is like you literally could
not stop like going downhill so no
matter how freaked out you are the only
way to stop is to fall basically long
story short halfway down the hill I
started to panic I still had it the
other half of the hill to go so I kind
of tried to hold it together til I made
it to the bottom of the hill and then
once I made it to the bottom of the hill
I just full-on panic it was it was not
pretty funny to look back on it now I
felt so out of control of like the
skiing and help that I was going that I
ended up just like bombing the rest of
the hill straight down and I almost hit
a tree and almost hit a kid it was just
like oh my god
note for next time do the beginner hill
like at least a solid you know six seven
times before moving on to like the
Graduate Hills anyway that's kind of my
now funny but at the time terrifying
story of how I ended up having a panic
attack while we were skiing they didn't
up getting as much blog footage as I
obviously wanted but it also got me
thinking about anyone that deals with
anxiety anyone that has anxiety it's
something that don't fully cure it you
don't ever fully get over it because
everybody actually has it the way that
it was explained to me once is that
anxiety it's like this trigger that
everybody has and normally it doesn't
get triggered unless it absolutely needs
to when it comes down to survival to
fight-or-flight in a life-or-death
situation but people that struggle with
more generalized anxiety social anxiety
and things like that their trigger is a
lot more sensitive and so things like
skiing down a hill or being in a social
environment or whatever it is it can
trigger some people a lot easier than it
triggers other people and just some
people have a more sensitive trigger
when it comes to getting anxious and
triggering that
in fight-or-flight feeling I don't think
my anxiety will ever go away and I have
totally come to terms with that which is
one thing that I think has really helped
me deal with my anxiety is to stop
feeling like I need to get rid of it it
comes in and out of my life especially
in the winter months when it starts to
get more gloomy and more cold that gets
a lot easier for me to be a little bit
more hermit and a little bit more
anxious I decided to make it into a vlog
style video of showing you guys how
exactly I deal with my anxiety nobody
wants to admit what anxiety is affecting
their day-to-day lives even I struggle
to admit it even though I talk about it
so openly it makes you feel inferior to
almost admit that something that you
feel you have no control over is so
deeply affecting your life so you try
and act like it's not happening because
it's so easy to think that nobody else
is having that issue everybody else is
just living my life so confidently so
why are you feeling that way so many
that you kind of own that you're feeling
that way then you can move on to
actually dealing with it and I've been
using things like work and the winter
weather as a clutch to just stay indoors
and stay inside my comfort zone and not
do anything that kind of makes me feel
anxious and I don't want to be that
person so the first thing I'm going to
be actually doing today is going for a
run it's beautiful I wouldn't show no
today which is such a blessing and then
when I looked at the weather it is plus
two we've had an extreme cold weather
warning recently you would go outside
your nostrils would freeze I haven't
been able to run outside yet in 2018
that's exactly I'm going to do and after
that we're gonna go shopping we're gonna
make a yoga room I'm gonna share all the
all the tips and tricks I have up these
very tight sleeves thing that I like
about running when it comes to anxiety
and just in general just working out it
releases endorphins into your brain it
gives you that runner's high it forces
you to get comfortable with being
uncomfortable it forces you to get
comfortable with feeling like you're
catching your breath or finding a way to
get balanced with that feeling and
comfortable enough with it that I can
keep running just because I feel like I
can't breathe doesn't mean I'm not
breathing I am breathing it's just you
have to almost get comfortable with that
you know feeling it but anyway that's me
rambling about running so I'm gonna
finish off the rest of this energy juice
and hit the road
I've been spending another time couple
women by my side I'll go to sitting on
my mind spend on bread wine
I've been sitting never ages ripping out
the pages how do I get so faded
how'd I get so faded oh no no dolly
Dina if you love me how you never
right then I just got back from the mall
there's a few things that I bought for
my like yoga fiying the apartment and
also there's some things that I ended up
buying online I'm a little upset I'm not
gonna lie because when I went into
indigo at the mall there was a bunch of
stuff that I bought online thinking I
wouldn't be able to find it at the mall
and indigo right now has a bunch of yoga
stuff out which is so weird I could have
bought some more things there but it's
okay I'm gonna do a quick little mini
haul and share with you guys some of the
stuff that I bought
so at indigo I ended up picking this art
piece up I don't know exactly where I'm
gonna put it yet or what room it's gonna
go in I also ran over to Urban
Outfitters and I picked up a little bit
of a gift for Greg because it's his
birthday tomorrow but also just a few
other things oh I also picked this up
from indigo it's like a hand statue and
then it just says the future is in the
palm of your hand so I thought thought
that was really cool
um and then from Urban Outfitters I
picked up this magic 8-ball I just think
they're kind of fun will this video be a
good video cannot foretell now I mean I
guess that makes sense because this
video isn't even done being filmed yet
true magic 8-ball true um if you guys
are curious I'll show you really quick
what I got Greg for his birthday or
Christmas Greg got us matching Rugrats
hats oh yeah I got us matching Rugrats
sweaters and then lastly I just got a
book I'm filming a video this week
that's all of the kind of like
life-changing books that I want to read
in 2018 so I saw this book and I decided
to add it to my list see you do you buy
saronite it's how to be who you are and
use what you got to get with your wall
last but not least I picked up a few
things to show you guys from H&amp;amp;M
so I grabbed myself this mahogany candle
mahogany is one of my favorite smells
and because I'm yoga fiying everything
in which I don't even think you'll
decide is a word but we're making it a
word trying to Zen out to my atmosphere
so that I have a place to relax and
meditate especially for when I'm anxious
I decided to pick up a new yoga outfit
I'll show you guys what it looks on
later on in this video but I just picked
up this like dusted pink sports bra and
then I grabbed these leggings to go with
it and they just have like pink and grey
lines all over the bottom those are the
few
things that I just picked up from the
mall now I'm going to actually make
myself some dinner and making a bootable
I feel like one of the biggest things
that honestly truly does help with my
anxiety more than I give it credit for
is making sure that I'm eating really
healthy eating a lot of whole foods and
eating a very balanced diet I think when
I do get anxious it can be very easy for
me to fall into bad habits ordering food
not really go to the grocery store some
days I do it so simply but there's these
odd random times where especially when
my anxiety is really piqued I get
socially anxious in all social situation
anything that involves me leaving my
apartment will make me feel like I just
want to run home and being that one of
my new year's resolutions this year is
to cook more vegan foods and only have
one takeout day a week I've been really
sticking to that and I'm really enjoying
cooking have vegan chicken skewers and
rice and lettuce and like all these
really cool ingredients I'm gonna put in
it so I'm gonna make that really quickly
and then head to the movies with Kat
we're gonna go see the greatest showmen
tonight even just as simple as going to
the movies with a friend I tell myself
like I don't have time or I should be
working or I give myself excuses as to
why I shouldn't do it a way out of doing
something that might make me feel a
little anxious that I might get panicky
or might feel anxious at now that I know
that that's something that happens it's
easy for me to be aware of those things
happening and easy for me to counteract
those bad habits and to not let them
form and not let them happen I feel like
it's such an easy time for bad habits to
just like trickle their way and when
you're feeling vulnerable and when
you're feeling you know the most unease
within yourself so knowing that I'm
gonna make myself a bootable and then
I'm going to get really anchored you to
movies right I wish I was a movie
theater we're bringing your dog was
allowed you're not even a dog though
you're like this is how
I feel the chemicals burn in my
bloodstream fading out again ladies mug
is brought to you by indigo I got this
yesterday at the mall - I don't know why
I didn't end up showing it to you guys
this is actually my second coffee of the
day I just got back from hot yoga which
is why I looked like a hot mess I went
and did a flow class it was actually
really good I really liked the
instructor today and that also checks
off like my one hot yoga class of the
week because I ran the last two days and
yesterday ended up running six
kilometers I just wanted to like flow
and stretch today but also sweat you
know what I mean I went into it feeling
very unlike connected and I wanted to
leave feeling more in sync it honestly
helps so much just to get your body
moving but also just to sync with your
breath and in sync with your mind
meditation on crack that's what I would
call yoga so I feel really good now I
feel very zen I'm gonna shower I just
went and picked up a bunch of stuff to
make cupcakes for Greg's his birthday
today I think we kind of talked about
this already but getting hobbies or
finding hobbies that make you feel
really relaxed and iyz and lately
cooking and baking just throwing on some
tunes or throwing on an audio book
following step by step I like that you
get like an end result right away and
then you can eat it which is just like a
double whammy but a clicking I'm baking
isn't your thing there's so many other
hobbies you can take on like painting
drawing drawing is another thing that I
really like to do I'm also hoping the
rest of my stuff for my yoga room shows
up today because god bless one day
shipping on Amazon I'm going in to take
a shower get ready and start some work
and then I'll touch back with you guys 3
there the bird sat on my window and it's
only I don't need to worry Sam became
like cinema so sweet little girls double
dots on a concrete maybe sometimes we
but it's alright the more things seem to
change the more they stay the same oh
don't you hesitate girl put your records
on tell me your favorite song you go
ahead in your hair down sapphire faded
jeans I hope you get your dreams just go
ahead let your hair down you're gonna
find yourself somewhere somehow do as
the sky Sun burn and lonely to the tea
in a bar by the roadside don't you let
those other boys fool you gotta love
that maybe it is now actually Saturday
January 13th
yesterday I changed around my bedroom
which you guys just saw added some
really cool like curtain fairy lights
and then the rest of the stuff for my
yoga room actually came in today I'm
gonna do that just after my morning
routine and then I'm gonna point out my
first ever like flow in my new yoga fied
room I have a lot to do today I have so
much to try and get done I'm already
obsessed obsessed with the new
arrangement of my bedroom to make
yourself like a safe space to make your
environment very relaxing something that
doesn't spark stress like that's why I
feel like I'm a little bit of a clean
freak is because helps me it relieve my
anxiety when I clean it helps me feel
better and less cluttered in my head
when there's less clutter around me
which right now is not a good indication
because my entire apartment is 100%
clutter but that's what tomorrow's war
we're gonna just tomorrow it'll all be
good after that even knowing I have it
just day makes me feel better but even
just in general you're just showing
we're anxious and more overwhelmed
lately I feel like something as simple
as moving around furniture adding a few
new things to your bedroom adding a few
new things to your environment if
you live alone you could do it in an
apartment or your house so wherever you
live constantly keeping things fresh and
changing and also just like clean and
organized it's what works for me so
today I'm drinking out of the yellow mug
because kind of matched my Rugrats
sweaters let's say I pick the yellow one
and also because it's Saturday and I
feel like Saturday is a yellow mug kind
of day I'm gonna read through my
horoscope I might pull a tear it card
just because it's Saturday I feel like
it's a bit more of a chill morning
routine not so like heavy go go go I
wake up I let Bethenny out to go to the
bathroom and then I honestly just make a
coffee I sit down I read my horoscope
and sometimes I'll like do my meditation
all journal I feel like incorporating
something of your own into your morning
routine it just starts your day off on
such a good foot and then you can go
into the rest of the day just feeling it
a little better and a little less
anxious
I recommend meditating for sure yoga if
you can writing even if you feel like a
sappy teenage you know weirdo writing in
the journal it's honestly I feel that
too but it's just it's so therapeutic or
scops tarot cards whatever it is you
want to do just something that's going
to incorporate easily into your wanting
your team it's going to give you a
little bit of your own headspace every
single morning to just be with yourself
and not feel it's something you have to
do but something you want to do
okay so there's just a few things I know
we kind of already did a mini haul in
this video but there's a few things that
I want to show you guys before I go
ahead and put them away basically just
creating a little area in my room that I
can pull up my yoga mat and do yoga
whatever so did some research and picked
up a few things
the first thing I have to show you guys
is the seven chakras root to crown set
and it is incense it comes with an
incense for all the different chakras
they are the root sacral solar plexus
heart throat third eye in crown
obviously when you're creating a Zen
space you want more candles right like
that just kind of make sense so when I
found these badboys ultimate fine
they're little mini cactus candles how
freaking cute is that like Oh looking up
a yoga strap and a little upset about it
though because I picked up a black yoga
strap book
they sent me a purple one purple has
been popping up a lot for me lately so
maybe it was just meant to be I don't
know yes I picked up this yoga blanket
um you can use the older blankets for
lots of different things you can use
them in your poses you can use them for
your underneath your elbows or knees for
certain poses if you have like sore
knees and stuff when I travel for
instance I'm heading to Hawaii next week
and I'm gonna bring this with me so that
I can do yoga wherever and that way I'm
not looking around my massive yoga mat
aroma diffusers so it diffuses obviously
essential oils which I also picked up
adds a little bit more moisture so it's
better for your skin it's better for
your breathing it's better for your nose
then you can also add essential oils to
them and it diffuses it into the air
ended up getting dragged one of these
for his birthday too this one has like
an LED light inside so it'll change
color and then the last thing that I
picked up is a yoga bolster bolster I
hope I'm saying that right
like almost pillow like thing but it's a
bit bouncier than a pillow and you can
use it to help support you in different
yoga poses there's certain ways that I'm
flexible and there's certain ways that
I'm not flexible like I actually find it
very difficult to touch my toes that
said I can do the splits so it'll help
support me in certain poses and
hopefully eventually I can do a lot of
the poses with it
so it is now six o'clock officially
finished everything that needs to get
done today actually got a lot more done
than I thought I was going to but I
ended up pretty much packing
most of my clothes for Hawaii which I
leave on Monday and I finished next
week's blog post so I got a lot done
I'm very I'm extremely pleased I think
it's easy when we feel anxious to
procrastinate the things that we have to
do or procrastinate the things that
we're feeling stressed or anxious about
my brain plays that trick on me a lot
and if I just do what I actually need to
do and not focus so much on the stress
or the anxiousness that I feel from it
and more so focused on just tuning into
it doing what I need to do and just
almost making it fun packing up my
laptop and going to Starbucks or
lighting up some candles and making
myself a coffee before I do those emails
making it more of a comforting or making
the situation that I'm anxious or
stressed about more fun makes this that
one I end up getting it done and feeling
better and to that I'm not
procrastinating it to a later time which
just ends up stressing me out and making
me more anxious and it also makes it so
that I can feel better at the end of the
day when I push myself like I pushed
myself today just get the things done
that I need to get done I got my workout
in I got doing exactly what you thought
you couldn't do proving yourself wrong
then at the end of the day you get to
bless yourself with a nice glass of wine
you can draw you can read you can can
make a bomb-ass dinner or order some
uber eats like whatever it is but you
can reward yourself for not only not
letting that anxiety or that stress
control you but also proving to yourself
that not only did you know somewhere
deep inside the whole time that you
could do it you also did do it and you
freaking slayed so I have about an hour
now before Greg gets here so I feel like
now that I'm done all of the work that I
needed to get done today I'm just gonna
sketch that's been something that I've
been trying to get more into and I'm
gonna throw my headphones in listen to
my new playlist which if I haven't told
you guys about I ended up making any
playlist this week which is what I was
listening to when I was doing yoga
earlier and so this is the place I've
been meditating to and doing yoga too so
I'm gonna pop that in and and do some
sketching my anxiety is something that
used to make me feel so insecure it used
to be something that in public
situations and not like even just within
my own brain when I'm home alone I would
I would beat myself up for feeling
anxious instead of seeing the things
that it taught me and instead of seeing
the strengths and a lot of way that it
brought me and I mean I don't live
inside your guyses my
so I don't know your filter on it or
your perspective on it but I feel like
if there's any way you can try and look
at it this way if you didn't feel
anxious if you didn't get stressed if
you didn't make mistakes if you didn't
freak out over things that felt stupid
you wouldn't have ever learned from
those things and you wouldn't have ever
been able to turn it into something else
when I think about the anxiety I had
growing up in high school in the ins ID
I had after high school things I do that
I still get today it's no longer
something that I look to get rid of
because I feel like it's something that
I won't ever get rid of it's part of who
I am and letting it have a presence in
my life I'm able to find a way to kind
of make it something that makes me
strong rather than makes me weak which
is super corny but accepting the fact
that I have anxiety accepting the fact
that I sometimes just get anxious and
not making it such a big deal gives me
the ability to change my habits and
change the things that I do around it so
that I can kind of grow from it and if I
didn't have those things I wouldn't have
been inspired to redo my room I wouldn't
have gotten inspired again to meditate I
wouldn't have been inspired again to do
yoga because the main source of
inspiration from all that was the fact
that I was feeling anxious and a lot of
ways as much as it sucks to feel that
way it also pushes me towards things
that bring me a lot of joy that I
wouldn't have been pushed towards had I
not had that initial feeling of anxiety
or stress so to each their own but
that's kind of how I'm choosing to look
at it so I'm gonna get myself a refill
while I wait for Gregg to get here
probably sketch something half-decent
maybe if I'm lucky throw on that 70s
show and they know I hope you guys
enjoyed today's video I decided to take
what kind of happened with skiing on
Monday and just turn it into something
or a theme that kind of followed
throughout the whole week and show ways
that I deal with anxiety and if you guys
have any ways to add that you like to
deal with your anxiety definitely feel
free to leave it down below so if you
guys want me to talk more about this
topic if you guys have any video
suggestions on this topic also pop those
down below and aside from that I will
see all of you guys in tomorrow's video
there you go figure out something to
draw I have know maybe I'll draw belly I
know
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
