okay
good morning and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm doing
another vlog with you guys
it's been a while since I've logged like
you know here in Toronto at home all of
my blogs lately have been travel vlogs
so I was like you know what I'm in the
mood to vlog today so I'm gonna vlog
today and tomorrow with you guys and
just kind of take you through you know
my life currently ever since I've been
back I've been kind of like trying to
force myself back into a routine and
I've been doing so many like I have so
many pre filmed videos and so many like
sit down cut and dry edited videos but I
was like damn I feel like it's been Wow
since we've just you know sat on my
couch without makeup on I got a little
bit an hour ago I threw some laundry on
ate some breakfast and I've just been
working on my laptop on my couch I have
a total of like three videos and I need
to film in the next two days so I
figured that kind of like the moral of
this vlog is going to be me showing you
guys how I film and edit and like my
process of getting videos up because
this is something that has been so
highly requested I wasn't really sure
how to film it so I was like you know
let's do a blog style and then in
between there I'm going to show you guys
what I'm eating and the workouts I'm
doing so yesterday it was the first day
of like this eight-week fitness
challenge that I'm doing I made a
challenge with my boyfriend that I want
to have abs in eight weeks so yesterday
was day one and we actually went for a
run last night and we ran seven
kilometers I normally run like 5k okay
and I was like making it like a point to
keep up with him so I am so tired and
I'm so totaled today what I'm forcing
myself to get get done you know so
yesterday was day one today is day two
and so I'm just going to do some
strength training today I might just do
it from home and show you guys like in
at home like ab workout and then I'm
gonna make myself a healthy dinner it's
just going to be a really really chill
log and I'm going to show you guys kind
of like the moral of what my life
actually looks like because my life is
not constantly traveling it's pretty
much me eating sleeping and filming so
shall we begin
yeah
please be me this time you're so what I
will do is play me baby yeah right
don't
all right
Oh
so excuse my music I would have to climb
over this heaping pile of lighting to
turn it off so hopefully it's not too
distracting but I'm going to show you
guys really really quick my filming
setup situation as well as how I focus
my videos because that let me tell ya is
like one of the most complicated parts
of the whole thing so I'm going to link
all my lighting down below I don't
really necessarily have the best
lighting to be honest I'm probably due
for an upgrade at least for the like
ring light but I have these two lights
here they are like the big box lighting
these ones have like a blue tone to them
so they kind of washed out the yellow
tone from the one in the middle
white balance like the colors with a
little bit more blue toned which is what
I prefer and then when I step behind
them this is my ring light and it's a
little bit more yellow toned but I find
it also brightens up the room a lot more
and then I just flick on my overhead
light because I was also a blue light so
then once I'm actually sitting in the
chair the combination of all the colors
I find kind of gives it a good white
balance my tripod is just from Amazon my
sister and her boyfriend got it for me
for Christmas this year too my old one
broke and as for my camera so I'll leave
the camera that I'm using to vlog down
below but for the camera that I actually
use for filming it is the eos 770 d and
i have a sigma lens on it right now for
my sit down videos when i do zoom in and
out videos or get ready with me videos i
use a different lens which I will also
everything I talked about is going to
link down below but this one is the
Sigma 1 - 1.4 so this is the lens right
here so this is what I use and I just
have the viewfinder flip towards me for
when I film so yeah that's the camera
that I use and I'm going to go ahead and
put my microphone on it so my microphone
is just a tack star I got it from Amazon
it was like decently cheap actually and
yeah so I just kind of clip this on top
and then I put a box in the chair focus
the camera sit down and I film yeah
that's kind of like the rundown
so let's film a video
Oh
so I'm officially finished filming my
videos for the day I just made myself a
huge salad it's like 3 p.m. so it's like
my p.m. snack and then I put a bunch of
crackers on top of hummus because I do
this now we're all like section off the
amount of crackers I'm actually going to
eat with hummus and dip them and then
put them there and then put everything
away because otherwise I would literally
eat the whole box and the whole tub of
hummus in one sitting I kid you not so
I'm just going to eat the salad and edit
some videos and get them up which
washroom dr. Phil so commence me time
don't agree yeah so it's now getting
close to 7:30 I'm about to do my workout
with you guys I'm actually just
uploading a coffee talk video for my
Tuesday upload I'm waiting for Doug
loading and answer some comments and do
my workout with you guys the clips you
guys saw of me driving I went and picked
up a bunch of parcels which are over
there can you see all of them underneath
my sweet little child's head I know
everybody your breath is stinky he's
hungry so he wants my attention yeah so
I got a bunch of parcels coming in sorry
to start guys but I have all these boxes
here these are all from society6 I'm
doing a huge apartment makeover video
with you guys feel like I ruined all the
surprises of my videos by telling you
guys this I also have a bunch of Lulu's
clothes up here and there's a dress in
there that I'm actually wearing to a
wedding this weekend so next weekend
this weekend I don't know my dates and
then a bunch of stuff up here too for
like journaling videos and like a DIY
video basically I have a lot going on
right now I have a lot planned for you
guys a little secret is I officially
rebooked my New York trip you guys
remember how many times I tried to go to
New York last year and I just like
everything kept on getting in my way so
it's a bit of a surprise because I know
Gregg he told me he had a weekend off
maybe we could do New York and then that
we kind of dropped it and then today I
was like you know what I'm gonna go
ahead and book it I'm doing that
literally days before I leave for
California so my month of June just got
way crazier than expected
I have to pre film so many videos from
now until so that for when I'm gone for
the last two weeks of June and like it's
the last week of June in the first week
of July
I need videos to go live for you guys
and I have videos going up until then so
anyways this is turned very much into a
vlog all about my filming editing and
uploading schedule and like how I do it
all but I feel like that something you
guys really wanted without further ado
I'm going to answer the comments on this
video which I usually spend about 30
minutes after our videos live I don't
know if I've ever told you guys that but
if you're ever looking for me to answer
your comments try and get in within the
first 30 minutes to an hour of a video
going up because that's usually when I
answer all my comments so if you don't
already turn on little notifications I
think there's something like a bell just
make sure you do that because that's
when I answer my comments and feedback
Li and we're going to get our workout in
and then we'll see real this vlog takes
us
Oh
what do I do
you
Oh
good morning it is now Wednesday morning
I woke up this morning made a coffee
guys all that fun stuff big filming day
I have three videos to film it's going
to be freaking crazy I wake up I make us
coffee and then I literally have in my
schedule so I use my calendar on my
laptop and it syncs to my phone and
that's how I like schedule all of my
filming all of my editing even like my
workouts and and grocery time like I
literally schedule pretty much
everything even creative free time where
it's like I can sketch or I can do like
photography like things like that the
only things that I don't necessarily put
in my calendar are like social things
which I don't even have that much of a
social life let's get real every single
morning though on my day calendar I have
a morning meeting it sounds so lame but
I I don't know what else to title it and
I just section off so Monday's I section
off two hours where I spend two hours
planning out my week answering emails
doing up all of the boring like planning
and all of that stuff and then every
single morning aside from Monday I have
a 30 minute morning meeting where I fill
out a video sheet where it's like
whatever I'm filming that day I like to
plan out make a video plot on a piece of
paper is 64 gigs to fill up today
so it's actually now Friday it's been a
few days since I blogged with you guys
because just got really hectic I
made videos not today is freaking crazy
I was trying so hard to vlog throughout
that but honestly it was very difficult
you guys on an update on the last two
days I went for two to four runs six
Commerce and 32 minutes not my fastest
but I really wouldn't feel like writing
tonight so it's kind of nothing and yes
this is how sweaty and red my face gets
when I run I'm not attractive I'm so out
of it on sticking to this fitness
challenge and then today I haven't
worked out yet but I'm actually but
ahead to my boyfriend's cottage and so I
wanted to share with you guys like what
I used to edit and what I make my
thumbnails with considering that's kind
of like become the theme of this vlog so
I use Final Cut Pro to edit my videos
it's a very commonly asked question from
you guys I think if you're going to make
videos you kind of have to find your own
little flavor or like recipe for editing
like all the things that I've learned
has been throughout the years of editing
and they around with Final Cut Pro or
even iMovie if you don't have Final Cut
Pro I used iMovie for the first like two
years of doing YouTube and then as for
my thumbnails I use PicMonkey it's super
easy I take my photo I dumped it into
vsco cam which is an app on your phone
and put a filter on it I use the exact
same filters hb2 on all of my thumbnails
and then I send it back to my laptop
like it or drop it back onto my laptop
and then I put it into PicMonkey adds a
little font at the top and then boom you
have it you guys can expect a lot more
coming if you guys are missing the vlogs
a lot then just let me know down below
and I can totally kind of like pull some
of the other videos out and just give
myself more time to vlog with you guys
because there's so much going on in the
next few weeks and other than that I
hope you guys enjoyed this vlog and
getting to know kind of how I edit film
and all of that fun stuff if you guys
have any more questions feel free to
leave them down below check out all the
links down below of all the things that
I use and as an that I love you guys to
the moon back and I
you guys fall in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
