it's only I don't need to worry no okay
like cinema well what's up guys and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm doing the second ever stretch
and talk on my channel this one's gonna
be new and improved I think I kind of
come up with a solution as to how to
make these struction talks slow a bit
better for lack of a better word and the
solution is I think I'm gonna make
stretch and talks more Q&amp;amp;A style and
keep coffee talks more advice style
which today's video I'm going to be
doing a Q&amp;amp;A stretch and talk so that way
I can actually stretch while talking I
feel like I need to like kind of
forewarn you guys normally when I go
through my yoga flow practice
I'm very kind of in the zone so I feel
like this is gonna be just we're still
in the trial-and-error mode
it's basically what I'm getting at here
really quick if you guys aren't
following me already I'm gonna pop my
Twitter and my Instagram right here all
of the questions that I'm gonna be
taking today are from Twitter but I also
posted on Instagram to let anyone that
wasn't already on Twitter could go and
ask their questions all the links I'm
also like reppin COEs so hard today so
this is one of the new Co sweaters that
just went live on Friday we're gonna be
doing basically one collection every
single month so it's while supplies last
this is the dreamer collection this is
one of the three different sweaters I'll
show you guys close-up because I'm just
so in love so it says Nirvana we give up
useless craving and learn to live each
day at a time not dwelling in the past
or imagined future then when we come
happy and free we then have more time
and energy to help others and this is
called Nirvana so that's actually
something I found out when researching
Buddhism we loved that idea by we I mean
my sister and I we have now partnered on
COEs so it's both of us doing it
together it's literally been a blast
damn right that's a lightning bolt Kylie
Jenner trying to come in here with her
weather collection and steal my
aesthetic I'm just kidding also okay we
have a lot of questions to go to
today and we had a lot of stretches to
do today so let's just let's just dive
on in shall we go ahead you know pull
out your mats or get comfy wherever you
are if you guys are gonna be stretching
with me I'm gonna start with you know
just seating pose I have no idea what
I'm talking about by the way I've leaned
forward and leaning back Oh
stretching out my shoulders that feels
way too good who's question shall we
take first it's gonna keep going with
the legs you guys can feel free to just
follow if you want okay
so elysia wants to know does in xiety go
away as you get older I think that
everybody's perspective on this could be
a little bit different I don't think
that my anxiety has gone away as I've
gotten older but I think that I've
definitely become better at managing it
I think that I have to get older you you
begin to understand life a bit more and
you begin to add a lot more knowledge
and wisdom to your own kind of roster
inside your mind anxiety isn't something
that goes away because I don't think you
can get rid of anxiety and I believe
that because I know for a fact that all
of us have anxiety it's normal to
actually have anxiety it's something
that is supposed to trigger in people
when there's danger to help you we
fight-or-flight people with an anxiety
disorder I have it and a lot of people a
lot of people actually have it now and I
think that it's actually increasing the
amount of people that have it in this
day and age for a number number of
reasons that we won't get into and I
think that you can learn to manage it
more like for instance I feel like I've
managed it a lot better as I've gotten
older because I understand it more and I
understand myself more when you learn in
your thought pattern when you start to
recognize your perspectives your
attachments and your beliefs about the
world about yourself and about
everything you start to catch yourself
before you get anxious so I think that
it doesn't necessarily go away but I
definitely think that it gets better and
it gets more manageable as you get older
because you become more aware and you
you gain more life knowledge from the
time like the longer time you spend here
here being earth next hush oh my god
Kate so Kat my friend if you guys he
goes I met her before she tweeted in
some answer question
she wrote if you didn't even
Bently what would you name them and well
that's hilarious if I didn't name
Bentley Bentley I would have named him
bear
he was almost named Kobe and I think if
I'd get another dog and I have the
ability to name that dog like I think my
next dog would be a rescue but there are
recipes you can get as puppies and I
think if I got the chance to name that
dog it would be bear or tofu undecided
but I feel like Bentley embarrass ounds
so cute together okay so I'm now gonna
you know just go on into tabletop start
arching me back but like when you're in
the yoga class and there's someone
behind you you're like I'm literally
shoving my butt in your face and then
tell her talk oh yeah I'm definitely
feeling the run today my calves are very
tight that was my back okay and then
Child's Pose you know you always gotta
throw some Child's Pose in there this
one always feels the best what's your
next question Alyssa wants to know if
your life was a movie who would you want
to play you I'm seeing Blake Lively girl
Blake Lively hell yes I've been watching
Gossip Girl recently so I feel like
Blake Lively probably be one of my
answers solely for that reason I think I
could also like Ashley Benson there's
something like really cool about Ashley
Benson although she might be too cool to
play to play me because she's kind of
badass I love everything about Emma
Stone so her because that's actually a
really hard question so I guess one of
those three the next question is and
your muse wants to know what made you
decide to move away from your hometown
to Toronto even though you'd be far from
your friends and family so I decided to
move away because I'd always wanted to
move my New Kingston and my hometown
wasn't where I wanted to spend my life
it was a great place to grow up
I made amazing friends I still have
amazing friends there but I definitely
knew that I wanted to get out and I
wanted to get out sooner than I actually
did just given the circumstances and
trusting the timing of the universe it
happened when it happened
and
initially I was kind of deciding between
Vancouver which is very far west in
Canada or Toronto and I ended up
settling on Toronto because of the fact
that it was just so much easier to go
home and visit my friends and family and
it was easier to move to at the time I
also feel like such a part of my soul
would have been really really happy on
the west coast only because I love the
nature there I love the mountains
everything about British Columbia is
honestly my vibe but Toronto is also
amazing I love that Geronimo kind of
feels like a little mini New York at
least to me anyway it kind of reminds me
of New York with a clean smaller
Canadian New York food is amazing and of
course if I didn't move to Toronto I
wouldn't have met the friends that I've
made here and I wouldn't have met Greg
and the last bit of time that I spent my
hometown I was really really unhappy and
I just felt very unfulfilled and I just
I knew I wanted to make a new home for
myself I knew I just wanted to see new
places and explore and try new things so
that's kind of why and also it's just
better for work like there's more
photographers here there's more of us
here and there's more people here and
the airport here goes to more places
than two tiny cities so just lowly
reasons like that we're warming up
except I'm really really really hot so
this body suit is actually a bathing
suit but I was trying it on and it was
so cute that I said leave it home all
right how are we doing so far are we
liking are we liking this Q&amp;amp;A style
stretch and talk are we liking that I'm
actually stretching with you guys are
you even stretching with me you should
join feels good I'm gonna stretch out my
wrist so kind of lean forward and back
you know pick the next question so
Moonshadows okay this one has a lot of
likes it says how to stay motivated and
productive when you're sad how to not
miss people how to not have an
existential crisis as a 19 year old
college girl and this is something that
I actually show GLE with a lot it's not
something that I normally talk about
only for the fact that I obviously want
my content to be happy and I want it to
be inspiring so I struggle a lot with
kind of talking about when I'm sad when
I'm actually sad I'm really good at
talking
after I'm sad Oh mr. rule my hips out in
terms of when I'm feeling sad the way
that I kind of stay motivated and
productive is I know now that when I
don't do the things that I I know I need
to do what I'm sad it honestly just
makes me feel more sad I'll know because
it won't just be a sadness it'll turn
into like a full depression if that
makes sense I try and just be easy on
myself and get as much done as I
possibly can and lately the biggest
thing that has been really helping me I
wrote this down one night I don't know
if I read it somewhere
or why it popped into my head and I was
in a weird mood and I had a bit of a bad
day and honestly changed like my
perspective over the last little bit and
it is stop focusing on the problems and
instead have fun making solutions when I
get really sad and feel you're having an
existential crisis at 19 or you feel
like you're missing people a lot of that
has its focus on the problem and instead
if you can shift your focus to the
solution and not just to the solution
because if you just focus on the
solution you could still stress about it
but if you focus on finding a solution
and making it kind of a challenge like a
fun challenge for yourself that instead
of you know being like oh crap like I'm
stressed out because I miss people it
could be like what's a way that I can
get in touch with people and not miss
them anymore but still be able to live
my life so maybe you start doing
FaceTime Fridays where you FaceTime
someone it's just even thinking about
doing it even coming up with fun
solutions and brainstorming ideas to
your problems can be fun and can take a
lot of the weight that you feel and
sadness out of whatever is going on in
your life so yeah my my biggest piece of
advice and the biggest quote guys that
I'm not kidding you it's been my life
motto lately instead of focusing on the
problems have fun making the solutions
Mike's just trying to get you to open
your mind and expand maybe we should
stand all right nice question I
apologize if I say your guy's name
but Reshma Sarkar
would like to know how did you meet Greg
also I love you will you ever do a video
related to yoga love and light from
India I might be coming to India this
year how did I meet Greg we met I was
Greg's whoop Greg's Cinderella
we met on tinder when I first moved to
Toronto I kind of I think I've explained
this story before but he I was actually
the day I was about to delete my tinder
because it proved to be very
disheartening right when I was going to
delete it I was like oh screw through my
inbox one more time and I scrolled
through and saw this cute guy holding a
monkey the monkeys always getcha realize
that I missed his message cuz he had
said like hello I wrote him back and
basically was so forward and was like
hey so I'm about to delete tinder but
I'm just seeing your message now here's
my number I'm not gonna lie guys I
didn't make him work for a few days past
that delete my tinder I didn't think
anything of it out of nowhere my friend
Christine was visiting and we were at
the mall shopping and some random
numbers started calling and then so I
picked up and the rest was kind of
history he called instead of texted
which was like first it was the monkey
then it was the fact that he called also
let's let's not ignore the fact that he
took a few days to call so that to me
was like a little bit of hard to get you
know he took me to a really cool vegan
restaurant and yeah like I said the rest
is pretty much history as for doing a
full video on yoga if you guys haven't
noticed even just in this video I'm
still a beginner I only started getting
into yoga in November I'm still learning
you're still aren't we're all just still
learning you know that's it I can
finally touch my toes couldn't do that a
few months ago my body is cracking today
oh my god my arms are just like I feel
like my shoulders are so tight it's my
first time doing yoga since being back
from Nashville and we flew all day
yesterday so my shoulders are a little
tight what's next Colby flood or flame
wants to know what's one thing you do
while filming that you always edit out
me saying um like I just did I always
added that out because I say I'm a lot
number two favorite state in the u.s. I
would have said at California but after
going to Nashville Tennessee is May it
might take their spot know Hawaii what
am i Who am I Hawaii a hundred percent
hands-down favorite place in the world
Hawaii 3 what was the happiest day of
your life I feel like that's such a hard
question to answer but I wouldn't say
was maybe the happiest day of my life
but off the top of my head when I was at
playlist last year and I'm at Jordan she
actually lives in Nashville but we were
at playlist and then that night they
closed down Universal and we all got to
run around and Universal and Jordan and
I just like ran off and entered this
world of like being kids again we
honestly we ran around Diagon Alley and
just we did Universal so right that
night it's a blog from last year but I
will link it down below but it was like
honestly one of the best nights in my
life unless you know what may be the day
I got that thing for I love you so much
please follow okay and 5 celeb crush
Austin Butler Liam I'm sorry oh my god
that's a hard question Oh Ryan Gosling
and the 6d like sloths I freaking love
sloths I saw a mug the other day with
sloths on it took every everything out
of my soul not to buy that mug Jeannine
Keyes wants to know would you ever do a
meet and greet and I most absolutely
would hoping to start planning some this
year it's just one of those things
there's always a little fear that no
one's gonna show up and - I am so afraid
of like letting you guys down in the
sense that I'm
actually like I I'm very eccentric in my
videos but in person I can be a little
quiet it's solely stems from the fact
that I get nervous around people in
front of a camera I'm totally fine that
said I also feel like I know you guys in
some way and I am also just in general
getting better at being just more myself
in social situations like I try not to
let my social anxiety kind of control my
life as much as it used to and Phil the
reason I'm kind of getting better at it
I'm gonna practice my little forward
bend and then I've been trying to get
good at doing these things you know it's
a work in progress
honestly it sure like I really need to
stretch my shoulders more than anything
feel free feel free to just go off
course by the way the next question is
Alison king wants to know what is the
best way to begin a healthy lifestyle
getting in shape is so hard and it keeps
me from doing it it's an excuse but it's
what's the best way to get in shape
without dreading it that's a really good
question my advice would be honestly if
you're dreading it it means you're doing
it wrong you should take away any
beliefs or attachments that you already
have and what it means to have a healthy
lifestyle and find what fits you because
what fits you might not be what fits the
people that you're watching on Instagram
or on YouTube or even what fits me yoga
and running has been something that
since November I have become so attached
and addicted and in love with that
becoming healthier and feeling better
has been something that I don't drive
and I don't wake up and drag going for a
run or dread doing yoga I wake up
excited to do it because I found
something that I love to do so don't
feel like you have to go to the gym and
lift weights if you don't want to go to
the gym and lift weight or don't feel
like you have to run if you don't love
to run try biking try yoga try boxing
try swimming try all the things try just
hiking in nature try walking your dog
honestly try all different types of
things until you find something that you
love something that kind of ignites a
piece of you because I feel like life is
too short to dread our workouts and life
is too short to dread doing things that
are supposed to make us feel good
because I think if you go out anything
with a stressful attitude oh yeah did
you hear that that was loud you're
ultimately
not gonna reap the benefits that you
should from it because it's just maybe a
sign that it's not for you that includes
like eating - for me again with eating
vegan and I have gone through phases
where I eat like a crappy vegan and I
eat like a healthy vegan and I just know
about finding that balance of in-between
if I go to hardcore healthy and I don't
eat the odd vegan doughnut or the odd
you know vegan pizza I go a little crazy
and I start to dread eating and I try
and eat mostly healthy but I balance it
out and eat vegan beets every now and
then and vegan ice cream every down then
if I know rhythm and a routine that
works for you and works for your life
and makes you feel good rather than
making you feel stressed kind of like
earlier instead of focusing on the
problems have fun making solution thanks
question rebecca says cereal or milk
first to which I reply cereal Jess wants
to know what is your opinion on the
phrase you can't love someone else
before you love yourself my answer to
that is that I think you can love people
if you don't fully love yourself yet but
I don't think you can love to your full
potential if you don't love yourself
that phrase is to black and white I
think in loving other people we can even
start to recognize the ways that we
maybe aren't as loving with ourselves
but I just honestly truly believe that
it takes loving yourself and being a
hundred percent accepting and nourishing
of yourself to be able to then love at
your full potential and I don't think
that that means that if you don't love
yourself you don't love other people I
think it just means that you can love
the absolute crap out of somebody but if
you aren't loving with yourself and if
you aren't taking care of yourself you
aren't at your highest potential or
ability to turn around and give them the
best version of yourself if that makes
sense so I think that it is important to
take time to love yourself and to learn
to love yourself so that you can turn
around and love the people around you
more and give more of yourself to the
people that you love and okay to my
questions and then call it a day
I'm just going to kind of do seated
stretches and wrist curls while we
finish this off so Lauren wants to know
what is the best thing about Greg and
Clemmy wants
so no where do you want to travel next
I'll start with Greg what is the best
thing about Greg he challenges me in
ways that drives me absolutely freakin
nuts sometimes we are so different in so
many ways
but a lot of our morals and our values
are the same and so for that reason we
butt heads quite a bit sometime I'm a
morning person he's a night owl I drink
a lot of coffee he drinks a lot of tea
like we both challenge each other but I
think we also both kind of keep each
other on our toes and we keep each other
wanting to better ourselves and inspire
each other to do so and one of the other
best things about Greg is something that
actually my sister pointed out to me I
didn't even notice it until she said it
but Greg also opens up a side of me
that's a lot more there's a word for it
there's a word for it there's a word for
it what is it passionate that's it Greg
that makes me a lot more passionate my
past relationships I wasn't as a fashion
it I wasn't as gooey gooey annoying kind
of like gross dripping and SAP and
something that my sister pointed out to
me is that with Greg it just happened so
naturally out of nowhere I look down and
I'm already holding his hand or like
I'll lay on the shoulder like hug him
and those are things that used to be
kind of harder for me to do in terms of
just him as a singular person he's very
driven and he's very loyal and he cares
a lot about the people that he loves and
then the next place that I want to
travel well I'm going to Coachella so
that's the next place I am traveling but
somewhere that I really want to travel I
want to go back to Hawaii I've been
wanting to go to Thailand for quite a
few years now it's always been something
I wanted to do like I feel like I need
to go get authentic Thai food and I
think I need to go pet an elephant on an
elephant sanctuary and cry my eyes out
because of its majestic beauty I want to
travel really really bad and I'm putting
that out there to the universe and
letting it manifests itself also that
awkward moment that you realize that you
put your Center on backwards so there
you guys have it I hope you guys enjoyed
