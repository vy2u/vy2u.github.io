through my ultimate efficient packing
checklist that I made just last year so
I'll leave a link to it down below if
you guys are going anywhere and you need
a packing list this has everything you
could possibly need on it now when it
comes to my suitcase I usually pack my
fancy your outfits first and I leave
them at the bottom because they're
probably not going to be the first thing
you need to grab for when you're there
and then I put some of my nicer closes
clothes on top like skirts rompers
dresses and such I use the next section
to put my shorts and then last I put my
pajamas on top of that because that's
usually one of the first things you need
when you get to where you're going so I
like to put my pajamas on the very top
and then I'm also just putting my shirts
in as well I like to put my clothes in
first because it can be a good
protecting barrier when on the plane for
other things that could possibly break
as for my undergarments aka bras and
underwear I like to put them in a little
laundry bag which is nice because you
can use that laundry bag for dirty
clothes afterwards and if you're going
somewhere tropical I like to put my
bikinis in a bikini bag in case when you
go to leave they're a little damp it
keeps them secure and away from all of
your other things so then I just pop
that in my suitcase as well
now as for any type of body products I
like to put them in a separate bag in
case they explode in the plane it
doesn't get all over your clothes these
aren't all the things I'm bringing but
this just serves you a good example and
I'm just using a little Lululemon bag
and securing them all in there so that
nothing gets all over my clothes and
then I just tucked that in as well then
I use the rest of the space to put
things like shoes and curling irons and
any products that I don't need to put in
any bags and I just kind of put them in
between everything so that it keeps them
from colliding with each other and just
adding in my slippers and hats and
anything extra and once you get all your
essentials and you'll be able to see how
much room you have left for extra things
like sweatpants and stuff that you might
not have originally brought so then I
just like to shut my suitcase and this
front pocket here if you don't have room
or you don't have a laundry bag I like
to use that
as a spot to put my dirty clothes when
on vacation
gotta turn them
so next as for my carry-on bag this bag
is from Victoria's Secret and Bentley
decided to climb in when I was filming
so I decided to throw it in for you guys
because it was so cute I like to put a
pair of clothes or just an outfit in in
case anything does happen to my suitcase
I also like to bring my makeup on my
carry-on because I don't want it to
explode or get banged around in the
plane my book my iPad and my any travel
essentials that I need and my purse so
that I don't have to actually wear it on
my shoulder as well as just sunglasses
and little things that I didn't want to
break or get ruined or lost in my
suitcase like my journal and chargers
and then some hand sanitizer and a lip
chap to bring with me on the plane as
well so that is usually what I bring in
my carry-on and that is pretty much it I
hope you guys enjoyed seeing how I pack
my suitcase and carry-on be sure to
follow my links below to keep tabs on my
trip and I'll see you guys all in a
future video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
