in time for the bachelor like I planned
this kind of don't tell me thank you
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel it is currently Sunday what's
today together Oh March 12 and it is 3
o'clock in the afternoon I actually just
made it to Kingston my hometown I woke
up this morning packed up and left with
Bentley and we're doing my birthday
dinner with my mom since I didn't get to
see her around my birthday burrito bowls
were just at which we're making it show
we're making a chilled she also made
this vegan Oreo cake which is looking
kind of insane very excited to try it's
really in my hometown I'm here until
tomorrow and then I'm not too sure
exactly what the whole plan is just a
bunch of people I need to see along here
first things first is that I need to eat
because food is important look out sighs
do you want to go fly be free one of the
best things about coming home and family
gets a backyard to run around in
we were staying impacted together with
your parents and I thought well if you
take this in a job right now I don't
think that we can work this out
I don't know it's that one I thought how
could I let you fall by yourself
long-waisted
become one now here we go
go down together anything no sweetness I
was clever - good morning guys it is 9
o'clock in the morning well 9:20 I
actually just dropped my brother off at
driver's ed and grabbed a coffee you
dropped a coffee off my mom and now I'm
just running a few errands so I'm going
to head to home sent because obviously I
grew up in my hometown it's so much
easier for me to run around and do
errands in my hometown actually that
person that's going to be like outside
when they first opened they're going to
eat me for my coffee today it's got me
so made with sugar free cinnamon and
coconut milk
super good am highly recommend if you
guys want something kind of like a latte
but a little bit cheaper
thank you
down together and spleen you could do
anything I was coming if we go down
there we go down together who can't
arrange everything with Sheldon we
offered stand back
we got
that
then justice no friends - jihad need a
get inside oh no no thank you
what's up guys it is now Wednesday which
means if you're watching this on
Wednesday it's the day of and I just
finished getting ready I'm actually
about to sit down and make a grocery
list because I need to go get some
groceries and I need to meal prep again
so I'm about to sit down and do that I
have a few more things that I want to
vlog today just to give this vlog a
little bit more like substance the first
things first I'm gonna show you guys
what i end up meal prepping and i'm also
going to go through kind of like some
goal-setting stuff with you guys to show
you guys a mini breakdown of like how i
go set and how i kind of deconstruct
each goal into like doable tasks such as
like writing dream catcher all that fun
stuff
also how cute is this sweater my brother
gave it to me massive and it's
comfortable and i honestly don't think
i'm never going to take it off oh well
hi baby gimme some love no story in my
life this way
can't get back so sing with me it's not
like we got this and you don't check the
mail for three months this is the first
time I've checked my mailbox the mailman
probably hates me okay so I'm going to
share with you guys how I like set and
plan out big goals and things like that
I have it in my schedule that like a
full plan with me video if you guys want
to see how I've been using my planners
and the last one I did I believe was in
October it was for youtuber and it's
changed a lot since then so if you guys
want to see like an updated like how I
planned slash like bullet journaling and
all that fun stuff have it listed down
but just you know confirmed because I
always just want to make sure that what
I'm putting out is what you guys want
something sense but in terms of WoW and
the world's worst multitasker I actually
spend like three hours last night
writing out all of my goals and like
doing my goal-setting so I'm going to
share with you guys exactly what I did
about marketing services the book that I
use to plan out like overall goals and
things that are going to take me like a
decent amount of time to finish so like
all my 2017 goals are pretty much in
here and I have little tabs at the top
and I'll just basically show you guys
how I did that to is super easy so some
of the goals that I have listed here if
you guys are curious are like publishing
dream catcher which is a big one
planning a Toronto meetup which is like
huge something that I want to get done
within the next few like two months
redecorating my apartment which I showed
you guys in my last vlog is something
I'm doing and then I have a little bit
the check boxes ready to go having
somewhere new
getting killer healthy like so generic
so the very top I'm going to put what
the goal is revamping my website because
I haven't been using my website in a
really long time now and then beside
that I like to write down the like an
end date because I find it
don't set a date that you want have it
done by it just leaves it so open it
would be nice to have us done by like
April but I have so many projects on the
go right now that I'm going to say by
May and then underneath that what I like
to do is just write down step by step
just any sort of breakdown that it's
going to take for me to get something
done so instead of it being just like oh
I'm going to completely revamp my
website okay well like I'm going to have
to take little steps to get there so
first things first like I'm going to
need a new website layout and another
thing about the website layout is I'm
going to have to do some hunting and
some researching which is going to take
a decent chunk of time coming up with
like an upload day rain storming some
post coming up with the tabs at the very
top and with the page it basically
anything is going to take for me to read
you my website is a check mark that I'm
going to put on here once that's done I
like to take a highlighter and again
once I do my plan with me video will get
more into this but I have my
highlighters kind of color-coordinated
and then I'm just going to take like
three things and I'm going to highlight
them or put a little star beside them as
like the first three steps that it's
going to take many little stars decide
is going to help you decide which ones
you need to get done first every time I
check off one star I have put a star for
the next thing that needs to get done it
also makes it easy that when I'm filling
out my planner I can make sure that I'm
keeping on top of like my overall goals
to that I'm doing something at least
every week to get me a little bit closer
to like the bigger goals that I have how
I make the tabs of the comet I just take
post-it notes and I flip it over to the
other side and I just write at the top
exactly what the goal is and then I just
place it on the page in front of it so
that I can easily see them at the very
top and then decide which page I'm
looking for or what goal I'm looking for
yeah that's like the basic rundown of
how I do goal-setting and then how I
kind of transfer my goals and keep on
top of each single step that it takes to
get to my goals and putting them in my
day planner this is something I used to
do back in the fall time but I
completely fell off picked it back up
just this week and already I've gotten a
few steps done it really does help give
me a sense of peace in my head and just
with my life because I feel like I'm
getting things done so I
hope you guys enjoyed this vlog as
always I'm going to leave the meal prep
that I did down below just in case any
of you guys want to you know follow
along unlike the whole fitness journey
with me as well as the workout that I
did I'll type it out in case you guys
want to follow that as well and yeah I'm
