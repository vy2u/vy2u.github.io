uniform a video ok film you're wonderful
you're your natural I need to tell you
why can't you so plated place what if
the rhythm is just DBZ today
Oh got your tune hey guys and welcome
back to my channel for today's video I'm
doing another video in the assaulting
101 series and this is all about hacks
and tips that you guys can take to one
and save you some money and to make you
a more eco-friendly adult I'm actually
partnering with an inconvenient sequel
to bring back this video and it's
something that I talked about in my San
Diego blog with you guys that I wanted
to do a bit of a series on my channel
how to be like more eco friendly because
it's been really inspired by lately and
been doing a lot of research into how
like the things we do affect our buyers
well things are obviously much higher in
terms of the threat against our
environment we are a lot closer to an
energy solution and there's also so many
things that we can do as individuals to
help even things like going and seeing
the film is taking action because you're
going to learn things about the
environment and also just will kind of
inspire you know that sense inside of us
that's like let's take care of our
fricking planet so Emily actually came
out on July 28th in both New York and
Los Angeles
gonna be able to see everywhere else I
was August 4th so definitely go check
out the movie and the fact that if you
guys want to know all of my steps and
tips and hats when it comes to being
more eco-friendly and sing more money
when living on your own then just keep
watching so step number one is to get a
reusable water oh this is probably one
of the best decisions I have ever made
this does not need to be expensive when
I was coming back from San Diego I
bought a bottle of smart water you guys
never heard of it before and it's
exactly one liter now my friends I have
a shot my wife has this really cool like
thermal water bottle and she was really
hyping it up and it was like thirty five
forty dollars to buy and I really want
the baby Bimal and I came home for
whatever reason
just kind of refilling this smart
plastic water bottle and drinking from
it I've now been at home for over a
month and I'm still using the exact same
bottle you don't have to go out and
invest in a super expensive water bottle
you can literally get one from like the
corner store the drugstore the gas
station and just keep on refilling it
and using it one is it better for our
planet because we're not using the
plastic bottles and constantly talking
about first of all because a lot of
people don't even recycle their plastic
bottles and it's throwing them into
dumpsters and garbage cans and - we're
also not using you're consuming as much
plastic so we're bringing down our
carbon footprint by reusing the bottles
or getting a water bottle that is
reusable and refilling it up with water
so that year one staying hydrated but to
also not wasting plastic and using more
classic that we really need to be using
and if you are looking to invest in the
water but if somebody you can buy that
are actually made out of recycled
materials to do some research or you
know Nicolas me and just buy the one
liter one and reuse that one because I
find it easier to keep track on my
bottles exactly one liter then I don't
definitely how much a drink by the end
of the day my second tip for you guys is
to learn how to compost and this is
something that I actually challenged
myself with recently because and of my
building we actually have a garbage
chute and the garbage chute godbless has
with a button for compost and it got me
thinking like why don't I compost
I'm vegan I eat so many fruits and
vegetables and I end up just throwing it
all in the garbage can to go down the
garbage chute
why not research how to compost and then
healthy environment and back then so
composting is actually super easy
there's so many ways you can do it I
believe some links down below if you
guys are interested in finding us me
doing a compost at home if you are going
in a home you can actually even put the
compost bin in your backyard and then
fill it up and it'll turn as a
fertilizer that's super good and
nutritious food is the best fertilizer
you can make but if you're like me and
you live in the city free living like a
condo then it's probably not as
realistic if you don't want to get the
actual fertilizer for itself but you're
just looking to you know help out and
for me all the difference I got a
compost bin that was the size that can
fit at least a week's worth of scrap and
then I made sure to get like the
biodegradable bags as well and then at
the end of each week I just thought was
I going to go put it down the garbage
chute and make sure to hit compost and
you're curious you can Google like your
local composting rules find out what
they say pick them up
like a home or an apartment where if
you're building something to do
composting Kyon's have some building
management and try and get something
going you know create a revolution and
it creates what you can compost you can
pretty much almost anything like fruits
vegetables all of those scraps or side
note you can also use some for soup
which is what I have also been doing
lately which makes your food so long but
if you don't have time to use them for
soup and they start so bad obviously
compost them you can all the compost
anything like crackers rice cookies
anything made with flour pizza any kind
of grain like quinoa you can recycle
coffee grinds which is amazing you all
know how much coffee grinds I probably
go through in a year tea bags outdated
box food there's not that much that you
can't compost aside from like meat and
dairy and fish which is understandable
because one it would smell and - I don't
know that just makes sense to me except
number three and - meal prep this is
something that might not seem like it's
going to be super eco-friendly but a
wine it will definitely save you money
and - it's going to save the amount that
we're wasting no scrapping is super easy
I've done a ton of meal prep videos
which I will link up on the screen as
well as down below so definitely go
check those out or it needs to buy like
a set of reusable containers which again
and super you go friendly and definitely
will hold with the environment keep some
key signs up because we're just looking
for this whole video is surrounded that
piece and then meal prep based on what
you already have make a small grocery
list so you don't need to buy too much
more than Mary and rice and paksa and a
couple veggies in your pantry and fridge
then work off of those and then you only
have to buy two or three things to
finish out your meal prep of the week
and make them know that there's no waste
you're not throwing up food at the end
of the week that has been completely
untouched you're saving your money and
also if you guys do want to be even more
eco-friendly a hobby should include
vegan meanness again isn't for everyone
and you guys know that I don't like to
show my opinion down anyone's throat but
when you do go vegan definitely save in
just one day 1,100 gallons of water
which is when you think about it
so much water forty-five pounds of grain
mine do is we were to all go vegan with
the grain that we feed the meat that
people eat could actually go to third
world countries and you know stop world
hunger but I want me to go there thirty
square feet of forest in one day
that's insane ten pounds of carbon
dioxide in the air
and one full animal that's in one day of
going vegan lumen is the most eco for
everything you can do and it'll save you
money when you're living on your own
because you're prepping and groceries
can be a lot cheaper if you do it right
if you guys want to know how to do it
right it could be a potential idea for
another video
home down below thumbs up let me know
because I can do a little my tip number
4 is to buy more eco-friendly cleaning
tools this is something I also have done
research into lazy the longest time I
was just finding what I always grew up
using you know like the Windex is and
the bleach and the cleaners and all of
that bust up even fabric softeners and
it wasn't until recently that I started
looking into getting more eco-friendly
cleaners those detergents you can get
there's even some fabric softeners now
you can get that are more eco-friendly
and a little bit nicer to like our water
system and there's so many cleaning
remedies that you can use now that don't
like go down the drains into our water
filtration and just completely wreak
havoc even making your own it's like
DIYs you can do and again it's not like
something you guys want to see it just
let me know because I could totally some
a video on that but like creating a
little spritz bottle of water vinegar
and a little bit of lemon is good for
cleaning like you know floors or
countertops or things like that instead
of using like harsher chemicals which
then go down our drains another thing
everything we flush and drain it go
somewhere where I just kind of out of
sight out of mind but in reality it does
come back to our site in our vision when
we certain see our ecosystems depleting
and deteriorating so I can go friend the
containers tip number five it's the same
energy at home and how much you do that
the first thing you can do which totally
save you money is to use your water like
major water consumption in the non peak
hours of the day which is usually 7 p.m.
to 7 a.m. but that's what I looked up
for where I'm living right now you might
have to google and find out your local
like peak and non-peak hours for using
water but this will take you a ton of
money and also just trying to use less
water in general again mind you I do
have to touch back on this because it is
such a mind-blowing concept but going
vegan will save 1,100 gallons of water a
day but still cutting back on like
keeping the tap on when you're brushing
your teeth
taking a bath instead of the shower
filling this thing up and doing your
dishes by hand as opposed to throwing
them all in the dishwasher every day
tiny little things that are one that
going to save money on your bill but to
also gonna help with your water
consumption
things you can do or turn off your air
conditioning and open up your window now
I know a lot of you guys live in like
Texas in California and Florida where
that may not be as feasible
but for us up here in Canada like I know
that it's a hot summer somewhat here in
Toronto it can get a little humid but
there hasn't been a day where it's been
so humid that have had to shut the
windows and turn back on the air it's
completely doable and also turning off
lights especially like I said such a bad
habit of this and Greg can tell you I
used to keep my string lights on all the
time I keep little like crystal lamps on
like this when I was leaving the house
my sleep overhead lights on when I left
the house for Bentley and graduate I do
like why are you doing that look even
just leaving this quick the lamp on it's
going to use a lot less energy and using
the overhead light what I'm leaving the
house and also find things like energy
sufficient light bulbs there's so many
different things you can do to save
energy at home and they're all super
easy and it's such a bonus because it's
going to save so much money on your
bills and then tip number six and this
is my last and final tip and probably
the one that I have the most fun with
and it's to minimize our belongings and
to recycle or like donate them a lot of
times you know we go through our
apartment or our houses and we do that
clean sweeps and we talk a lot takes an
extra like 15-20 minutes out of our day
to drop things off at like Goodwill's
Valley villages or Red Cross like
anywhere that you can donate your things
or better yet recycle them in a way that
you can get another use of them a
different use out of them or give them
to somebody else that you might know so
doing this is fun in the sense of one I
know it doesn't save us much money to
like reduce the things that we have
around us but I really do think it does
column with a better peace of mind to
not be so overwhelmed and cluttered by
the amount of things that we own and it
is important to have a good day every
two months three months maybe like four
times a year where we go through all of
our belongings and we just kind of like
donate what we are using
or maybe recycle things that we have no
use for anymore to keep so much junk
that is not able to be broken down out
of landfills you got to think about it I
remember being a teenager and going
through my clothes and being like
whatever I'm just going to throw all
these into a garbage bag and show them
as a dump and those are probably still
sitting in a landfill somewhere
completely unused and not breaking down
at all where there could have been
children who could use them other
teenage girls that could have gotten
them there's so many different ways
that we can get rid of the things that
we own whatever this is convenient for
me to just throw this out I'm just going
to throw it in the garbage and it's no
longer my responsibility that was my way
I can move on with my life but just
taking the extra 15 to 20 minutes to put
a little more effort in recycle donate
and you know just in general take a
little bit of time to be a bit more
cautious of the way that we affect our
environment is so helpful and also like
I said just minimizing our stuff in
general which is again there's so many
spin-offs from this video it's another
video I can totally do it's like how to
minimize and how to use less but get
more it honestly does bring a better
sense of peace to our lives and makes us
a little bit more grateful for both
those things we do have which includes
our environment and our product and so
that concludes my six tips when it comes
to being a more eco-friendly adult and
also saving money you guys want me to do
a part two of this because there's so
many more ways you can do it let me know
or any of the other videos that I
mentioned in this at all a lot of you
guys do end up going to see an
inconvenient sequel let me know because
I'm definitely seeing it and I want to
know your opinions and other than that I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
love you guys to the new back and I'll
see you guys all in my net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
