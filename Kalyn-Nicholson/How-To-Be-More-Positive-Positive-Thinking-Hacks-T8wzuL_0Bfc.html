whatever trying to like make my video
intros a little different hey guys and
what so today we're selling a coffee
talk and you're probably thinking no
you're not you're filming a vlog we're
combining the two is spring cleaning my
channel I figured it would be fun to try
a new style of video or filming or
whatever we'll see how it goes but for
today's video I wanted to talk to you
guys about spring zip I wanted to talk
to you guys about spring cleaning our
minds for you know the spring tide and
thinking more positively and just
getting into good healthy mindsets for
the springtime so I came up with 11
steps slash tips that I think are
important when it comes to trying to
think more positively and spring
cleaning your mind and it's funny
because this is actually super relative
to my life because if you guys have been
watching my most recent videos you'll
know that I was like in a weird space
lately like headspace and just overall
my energy level and I was finding it
super hard to remain positive and keep a
good attitude about things I didn't see
it then but it was a huge learning
process for me and I overcame a lot of
things over the last little bit
especially mentally and that's why I
feel like it's a good time for me to
film this video because these are kind
of like the 11 steps that pulled me back
into feeling like myself again and not
only just feeling like myself again but
feeling like a more positive and like
happier version of myself again
so I have all my tips here and I'm going
to film this in 11 different places but
seeing as this is a coffee shop first
things first we need to make a coffee
I feel like you guys have watched me
make coffee on camera probably about a
thousand times so tip number one when it
comes to spring cleaning your mind is to
vent to somebody like think of it this
way when you're going to spring clean
your house odds are you need to get rid
of all the junk that's there first so I
feel like if you just try and flip your
mindset and thankful are positively
without clearing out what's been built
up and there and all it's going to do is
mask it until it demands to be felt
again this was my issue over the last
little bit I wasn't really sure exactly
what I was feeling or what was going on
so I didn't feel like I could talk to
anyone about it I need to figure it out
for myself before I talk about it and
that's not the case just talk about it
to somebody and you will feel so much
better
and this might surprise you guys because
I am so open with you guys here on the
internet but in person it takes a lot
for me to really trust somebody with my
deepest thoughts and feelings I'm very
insecure about how complicated my head
can get just recently I vent it out to
somebody who has become very important
to me and that's a topic that we can
discuss and in other videos saying it
out loud and just getting it out it was
like clearing all of the junk out of my
head so let it all go and the only way
to let it go is to get it out there
write it out to yourself if you really
feel like you can't talk to anybody ever
step spring cleaning your mind is
clearing the junk
okay tip number two is to utilize books
and quotes and people or YouTube videos
whatever it will grow so I leave a list
of all of my favorite audiobooks down
below I find it's always good to know
that you have like a good source of
inspiration or motivation to go to any
time you feel like you can't get out of
a bad mindset I think I've listened to
you or about us like I'm not kidding you
like six or seven times but I know every
time I finish reading it I feel so much
better I feel so much different and I
feel so much more motivated and my brain
feels so much more clean so when it
comes to spring cleaning your life I
highly suggest audiobooks YouTube videos
anything that's going to give you that
burst of inspiration and motivation to
think more positively and especially
well dry the idea books are incredible
for when you have to drive anywhere
instead of listening to the radio you
pop on a good audio
get some motivation and some inspiration
before you even get to where you're
going which brings me to tip number
three and that is figure out when you
start to slip and then spite it by that
I mean it took me a while to kind of
realize the certain habits behaviors and
things that would kind of contribute to
me falling back into negative pitfalls
this could be things such as
procrastinating letting like tiny little
things like other people's opinions on
something or if someone else was in a
bad mood around me little things like
that I noticed that that would be like a
pivotal moment in my mind to when I
started to think negatively again if you
can become crisp and clear on the types
of things that tend to trigger a
negative response within yourself then
it's easier to fight those things and to
counteract those things not that it's an
easy thing to do or still things that
are going to put you in a bad mood but
when you know what those things are it's
so much easier to try and fight them for
instance this is usually the time of day
that I like to sit down and take a nap
which then makes me wake up groggy and
not happy so instead I let my laptop get
some work done
so tip number four is to change up your
routines in your environment changing up
my morning routine has been one of the
biggest things in terms of helping me
get motivated and feel like positive and
inspired again I think when you're doing
the same old thing over and over again
it's easy for you to think the same old
thoughts over and over again waking up
at a different time changing where your
bed is in your room taking a different
way to work or ordering a different
drink in the morning from Starbucks when
you change of your teens and you change
up your environment it kind of gives you
a fresh perspective not only that if
you're trying to change your mindset I
find that the more things you change
around you it's going to kind of keep
that inspiration so yeah change it up
it's good for you my next tip when it
comes to spring cleaning your mind it's
everytime you go to bed to find ten
things that you're grateful for because
if you're anything like me a lot of the
times especially when I'm feeling super
anxious or things are just like all of
the things are happening give me a
little difficult for me to fall asleep
because there will be these negative
pessimistic thoughts rolling through
right all the time like I so much to do
tomorrow I'm not going to be able to get
it done or tomorrow's going to be a
crappy day or even worse you're sitting
there thinking about how bad the day was
leading up to going to sleep so when you
make it a habit to find like 10 things
that you're grateful for before you go
to bed every night it can even be as
simple as wait
up and being able to breathe seeing your
dog things like that if you find 10
things every single night before you go
to bed to be grateful for it definitely
helps to retrain and spring clean your
mind to be more positive it makes you
have a better sleep and wake up feeling
more positive than you did at the day
before going to go ahead and you know
just myself and think about my 10 things
and uh night no you remember living in
this my next steps are spring cleaning
your mind is to use affirmations trust
me when I say that like I used to things
that affirmations were like kind of lame
and a little bit corny and I'd feel
super weird about it but I'm telling you
what they actually worked I'm not saying
it to sit there and like constantly be
like I love myself I'm a beautiful soul
I like to use affirmations in the sense
that when I notice myself smiling and
getting super negative and thinking a
lot of negative thoughts especially when
I'm by myself I like to outloud say some
affirmations that are usually going to
make me feel better and help me like
counteract the thoughts I'm having so an
example of that is if I'm feeling like
everything's going to go wrong today and
this is going to go wrong and I don't
even want to do this because I already
know that it's not going to happen I'll
like stop myself down in my tracks and
Olave something like nope I'm going to
have the most productive day in the
world and saying things like that out
loud and affirming yourself or you can
even write them down in a journal that
completely stops your negativity dead in
its tracks and shifts it to a new
perspective even if you don't fully
believe it with your whole heart yet
saying it out loud makes it feel just a
little bit unreal now if you guys can
hear me or the train goes by
right for my next tip for you guys it is
to actually meditate so I'm sitting
outside with you guys right now because
this is where I like to do my meditation
it sounds super lame but honestly every
single morning and every single night I
try to come up here and just sit before
I go to bed and sometimes I'll think
about certain things sometimes I like
light a candle and put on the table here
tiny meditate everyday will make such a
world of a difference on your peace of
mind it's just giving yourself that time
to kind of like collect your thoughts
like make sense of everything that's
going on in your light and trying to
find the positive and and kind of erase
all the things that are bouncing around
in your head all the time and just find
this like peace of mind not a habit that
you guys have already I highly suggest
meditating especially if you can do it
outside it will make a world of a
difference on your life Deven Messiah
all the answers we seek are within if
you give yourself the time to kind of
like think about it you'll usually
figure out your answer or find the
positivity in any given situation my too
windy out today after my eighth tip it
is to have a back-up plan and if you're
confused about what I might mean by that
I mean had like a favorite person that
you go to a favorite video that you
watch maybe even a playlist or a song go
work out get yourself your favorite
treat have something that you do as a
back-up plan that you know always puts
you in a good mood if you have a
favorite person that talks you out of
that negative mindset we're working out
makes you feel super good and positive
after or going out and getting your
favorite coffee or listening to your
favorite songs pumps you up and makes
you feel positive and good always have
that ready to go as a back-up plan if
all else fails so for Ken one day
whenever I find myself in a super
negative mindset I love this are my
headphones on place I'm like super
upbeat or like some like gangster rap
music and dance around my apartment
after my next to tip number nine is to
be patient with yourself this is
something that I struggle with because I
guess I'm a little bit more impatient
than I like to admit and once I decide
something I tend to put a lot of
pressure on myself to be a hundred
percent perfect at it right away and a
lot of you guys might relate to that and
so when I'm trying my hardest to be a
more positive person and I catch myself
a negative mindset I tend to kind of
beat myself down for it which then only
creates more negativity you realize that
it's okay to be a little patient with
yourself that you're not going to be
perfect right away it's kind of like a
muscle need to work on the way you think
and your thought process and mindfulness
in order to become a more positive
person if you go into it already
understanding that you're going to have
to be a bit patient with yourself it's
going to make it a lot easier and tip
number 10 is to make positive thinking I
have it rather than something that
you're trying to do let me explain in
case you're confused I was rereading you
air about it the other day I told you
guys in this video and one of the
sections of that book she talks about
the difference between trying and
decides when you decide you are making
the full decision to go out at full
force versus trying where you're kind of
going at it and expecting a chance where
it might not work out so if you make it
something that is a habit rather than
something you're trying to do it in
grains is that it's something that is
already yours it's something that you've
decided on it's something that you're
not going to quit until you got there
versus trying is something that you do
until it becomes too hard or too
uncomfortable and then you give up
hopefully that makes sense so don't just
try decide yes I'm wearing a shirt that
says moose don't ask questions that
don't have the answers to I have served
my last and final tip when it comes to
spring cleaning your mind for the spring
time it is just think big this is the
biggest tip I use for myself anytime I
find myself spiraling falling into a
ride kind of getting into that victim
mentality of feeling super negative and
like poor me and why is the whole world
out to get me and everything sucks all
the time I remind myself to think of the
bigger picture and it always pulls me
out of those mindsets and by thinking of
the bigger picture I mean remind
yourself you right now at this very
second look at the time look at what's
around you how old are your absolute
favorite people right now what is your
favorite song right now take in every
single detail of what is happening with
your life right at the second because we
let ourselves constantly be blinded by
negativity then we tend to miss it all
we tend to forget that we're just humans
on this freaking rock that's spinning
and like orbiting around a star and a
universe amongst billions upon trillions
and trillions of endless galaxies and we
have no idea why we're here tend to
forget how much of a miracle it is to
wake up and to breathe and to have the
opportunities we do and to have the
people around us that love us and to
have the things around us that we love
to do you will not find one person on
this earth that doesn't deal with some
sort of problem everybody's going
through crap you
have the highlighter in your hand if you
want to highlight the negative or do you
want to highlight the positive anytime I
think of the bigger picture any time I
kind of check into the moment around me
I realized that my parents are getting
older I'm getting older this won't
always all be here I won't always all be
here really helps put into perspective
how minuscule and tiny the negative
things that I'm letting soak up every
single moment of my light are absolutely
everybody on this earth filled with
negativity and if anything we almost
need it to understand and appreciate the
positivity and the joy in life when our
time does come we don't feel as though
we've let all of this negativity has to
shadow on everything else in our lives
understood it's balanced and we decided
to still focus on the good so sync big
so that is it for my tips when it comes
to spring cleaning your mind and
thinking more positively for the spring
times no matter what you're going
through I'm here for you I feel you all
of us are all in this together and as I
than that I love you guys to the minim
back and I'll see you guys all in my
next spring cleaning video or actually
my next video is not a spring cleaning
videos vlogs but the video after that is
another spring cleaning video I'm just
going to see you I'm just going to see
you bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
