camera he's literally digging his bone
into the pillows you gonna hide
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I wanted to film
another coffee talk with you guys hence
the coffee can we get a round of
applause that I actually remembered to
make this prior to sitting down for this
video it is a rare occasion but I'm glad
today was one of them holy shiznit
that's a really good coffee let's dive
in so recently I asked some of you guys
what kind of coffee stalks you wanted to
see and a lot of you were talking about
relationships being single being on your
own and all of that so I decided to do a
whole coffee talk on how to be single
now if you guys didn't know this pretty
much since the time I was 15 I was in a
relationship and then I had two
relationships after that that happened
so shortly after that I never really got
a chance to be single until last year I
spent about a year and a half being
completely single I got to live with my
best friend I got to live on my own for
a year so much of who I am right now
came from that year and a half of kind
of feeling lost and single Bentley
you're making a massive mess bro we're
trying to have some deep talks over here
I mean maybe I wasn't fully single
because there was always one boy as time
started to progress I actually I started
to struggle with it and I found it kind
of difficult there were so many things
that I was doing completely wrong and so
many like perspectives and mindsets I
had that were really wrong and now if it
wasn't for that phase like there's a lot
of life lessons I would have been able
to learn about not only life but myself
and so I kind of came up with a little
how-to system on how to be single my
first tip when it comes to being single
is stop needing somebody to fill up your
time if you like we live in a world
where we're like we're so flooded with
social media we're so connected but not
connected at the same time that we fear
the thought of being alone because I
think we need to fill our time with
other people so that you know we don't
have to face the things about ourselves
that we maybe don't like or maybe we've
become so lost or so out of touch with
ourselves that spending time alone we
get so bored we don't know what to do we
sometimes fail to realize is that you
don't need somebody else to make you
feel a whole you need that relationship
with yourself and I know that that
sounds super corny but it's true a lot
of the times we think that if we're
alone if we're not constantly with a
best friend if we're not constantly with
somebody if we have to code
without a plus-one or someone on your
honor that we're missing something that
we need and we we aren't all you need is
yourself if you can build a strong
enough relationship within yourself
you'll understand and realize that there
is no insistent need to be around
another person at all times whether it
be a friend or a boyfriend or whatever
read watch the shows that you like to
watch do things on your own find new
hobbies find new interests spend hours
on your computer on tumblr like just
start loving yourself the way you're
waiting around for somebody else to come
along and love you tip number two when
it comes to how to be single is to try
new things
solo travel alone take yourself up for
dinner take yourself in for the movies
try a new hobby try a new class go to
boxing whatever it is do things by
yourself it is the most daunting /
terrifying thing in the world but it's
also the most liberating and gratifying
thing to do it learning to do things by
yourself it gives you a sense of
strength because one you don't feel the
need to be talking to somebody you don't
feel the need to care if anyone sees you
out by yourself you're just like yeah I
I wanted to try this new sushi joint so
here I am eating a ham roll and doing
some emails on my phone it's also
important to realize that 99% of the
time when you think everybody's pointing
and thinking wow that girl's by herself
what a loser they're thinking anything
at all odds are they probably don't even
notice the only opinion that might get
in your way is your own if you have some
spouse police that you need somebody to
do something with you at all time go out
try new things all by yourself and I'm
kidding you as scary and as anxious you
might be at the beginning by the end of
it you learn so much about yourself and
you'll have such an inner sense of
strength to be able to go out and do
things by yourself that when you
eventually do have somebody to do them
with it'll almost be one of those things
where you're like can you can you can
you not come tip number three when it
comes to how to be single is realize
your Worth and your potential stop
spending your time wondering what you
can offer to a guy and start asking what
you can offer to the world or to
yourself or to your own life start
taking care of yourself start doing
things for you and not for anybody
else's attention or anyone else's
approval you want to work out neat
healthy great the doofer sense of taking
care of who
you are if you want to get your hair
done a certain way or wear certain
clothes all power to you do it for you
do it so that you feel good do it so
that you build up the life that you love
for yourself you had to learn to treat
yourself with the respect that you're
waiting around to get from other people
whether it's the approval for what
you're wearing the approval for the way
you look what you want to say what you
want to do who you are as a person not
waiting for somebody to come along and
make you feel like you're good enough
and tell yourself that you're good
enough you have to learn to be confident
exactly how you are for exactly who you
are and once you do that you've
officially mastered being single tip
number four when it comes to how to be
single is be selfish this is the best
time for you to be selfish find your
hobbies your tastes your interests and
very unapologetically fill every ounce
of your time with them watch the really
lame corny Netflix series that you binge
watch because nobody's around to judge
you take that trip to New York by
yourself or choose the floral bed spread
and the hot pink couch you have
absolutely nobody around telling you
that you can't do these things now that
being in a relationship means you can't
it just means this is the time to make
all the choices you want to make as
selfishly as you want because you don't
have anybody else to keep in mind at
this point this is a perfect time for
you to get out and explore your tastes
and explore your hobbies and just be as
selfish with your time as you want to be
it's literally the time you have to have
everything exactly how you want it and
my last and final tip is to stop
thinking that something is missing from
your life because it isn't this was
something that I struggled with the most
lot first I was like woohoo and then all
of a sudden a few months in I started
looking around at all the people around
me that were in relationships and I
started to think that there was
something missing from my life because I
didn't have that everything about you
and your life is perfect just as it is
there will be a day that someone's going
to enter your life and they're going to
become your person and you're everything
but just because they aren't here yet
doesn't mean they're missing it just
means that this phase of your life isn't
over yet and that phase isn't here yet
it means there's still so much for you
to do before that happens there's still
so much for you to learn and grow
there's still so much potential in this
phase of your life and that's why it
isn't here yet it doesn't mean it's
missing
it just means it's on its way enjoy this
part of your life while it's here and
while you still have it if you walk
around thinking that something's missing
or thinking that you're a loser because
you're single it'll turn you bitter
towards love it'll turn you bitter
towards other people and then in turn
it's going to attract more of that type
of negativity in your life when you
become so confident and full of just
being by yourself
other couples and lovey-dovey things
don't bother you you appreciate them
because you know that's gonna be you one
day but at the same time you're allowed
to enjoy exactly where you are though
being that lovey-dovey in a relationship
and wish you could person yet seeing
this phase of being single as a gift one
day the lessons you learn and everything
that you go through all these hardships
of trying to figure out how to be
yourself is going to fit like a puzzle
piece into your future life where
suddenly you'll understand things and
relationships or suddenly you'll
understand things about yourself or in
your life that you wouldn't have figured
out if you were never single and got
that time to figure it out and go
through it and eventually it will all
make sense so for now and I mean
realistically forever but especially for
now be your own best friend take
yourself out understand your potential
and realize that there is nothing
missing in your life just because you're
single so that is it for today's coffee
talk I hope you guys enjoyed it let me
know your guys's thoughts on how to be
single down below if you guys have
anything to add any tips or if you have
like a story are you single are you not
single let me know I'm obviously not
single anymore but I can honestly tell
you that if it wasn't for that year and
a half of being single I don't think I
would appreciate my new relationship so
much more and I also don't think I would
have been mature enough or ready enough
for this relationship had I not you just
have to have faith that it's all gonna
make sense one day and everything
happens for a reason and trust me the
universe will just unfold this amazing
life for you you just kind of have to
trust and with that I love you guys to
the moon back know that you're never
ever fully single because hey I'm here
other than that I will see you guys all
