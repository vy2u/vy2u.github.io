to be giving you guys just some tips and
little ways that you can become a
warning person now typically I'm
somebody that has been a morning person
for pretty much as long as I can
remember even being a kid I remember
getting up super early and just going
downstairs and making breakfast and
watching kid shows but as you get older
you know you stay up later and there's
more stress in your life and it just
becomes so much easier to just hit the
snooze button and sleep in till noon now
that said a study showed that over half
of Americans said that they were at
their personal best between the hours of
5:00 a.m. and noon now I'm not telling
you that you have to get up 5:00 a.m.
but when I am telling you is that most
people tend to be getting the most done
or the most efficient or just feeling
the best between those hours so if you
get up earlier you might get more done
and in turn be a happier person you
might even just feel more all-around
like positive and happy and successful
and another study showed that people
that get up earlier in the morning tend
to be more optimistic and proactive
meaning that they get more things done
than the average person that sleeps in
so if you are somebody that is totally
not a morning person and likes to sleep
in then this is the video for you
because just adding this little change
onto your life might make you feel
better more positive more optimistic and
just get a lot more stuff done so I'm
challenging you guys that if you are the
type that stays up all night and sleeps
in all day to give it a go give it a try
and see how it makes you feel so with
that said if you guys want to figure out
some tips and tricks to become a morning
person
then just keep watching
Oh
so one of my first tips for getting
yourself up in the morning is to keep
your alarm away from your bed not only
is it better for you to not sleep with
your phone but just keeping it on the
other side of the room forces you to get
out of bed so that you have to go over
to turn it off and then once you're
already up and out of bed it's so much
easier to just stay up versus roll over
and go back to sleep and my second tip
is to either go right outside and get
some fresh air or just open up your
blinds and get some daylight because
that's instantly going to wake you up
just getting the daylight on your face
or the sunlight on your face it'll just
make you know it's morning and yeah it
just wakes you up and then thirdly I
really like making my bed I mean this is
a habit that might take you a while to
get into if you're not someone that
normally makes your bed but making it
right away keeps me from crawling back
inside and going to sleep so another
really important tip if you're trying to
wake up earlier is to go in 15-minute
intervals and just slowly ease yourself
into getting up earlier so if you
normally get up at 9:00 get up at 8:45
and then at 8:30 and then at 8:15 and
then 8 o'clock and just keep going until
you get to the hour that you really want
to start getting up at and this is going
to make it easier and not so much of a
shock to your system or shock to your
body getting up so much earlier than
normal doing it 15 minutes early each
and every single day will make yourself
ease into it
another really important tip is to
change your alarm to something that
isn't so annoying and won't make you so
grumpy when you wake up in the morning
so I change mine to some of my favorite
songs and I like to change mine up a lot
so that I'm not always waking up to the
same thing every single day and it's so
important to skip this snooze button I
know you think the snooze button is your
best friend but what it actually does is
it causes you to fall back into a sleep
and then make yourself come back out of
sleep again and doing it over and over
and over again is just going to trick
your body into thinking you're going
back to sleep when you're not so you're
just going to end up feeling more tired
than you were before so just get up when
your alarm goes and try not to hit the
snooze button or else you're just gonna
feel way worse another really important
tip I find that helps me get up in the
morning is to have a little morning
routine and just something to look
forward to now I'm someone that I love
coffee as I'm sure you guys know so my
morning coffee is just something that
I'm always looking forward to in the
morning it's something that's just for
me and it's just 15 minutes of just
hanging out by myself and I'll read my
horoscope or I'll just kind of look
outside or do whatever I feel like doing
that day but it's just something I'm
always looking forward to so it kind of
helps me get out of bed in the morning
now I'm somebody who recently really
loves running in the morning but if you
don't have time for that even just 15
minutes of stretching is really going to
wake up your body and stretch out your
muscles and get yourself moving for the
day and of course I know you guys
probably hear this one a lot but try not
to skip breakfast this is going to give
you the boost of energy you need in the
morning and just it's going to kickstart
your metabolism and it's going to make
you feel a lot less groggy and if you
guys are wondering what I'm making here
I like to make bananas with cinnamon and
sometimes I'll even put just a little
bit of almond milk in it as an extra
treat
so something I find really helps me is
planning out my outfits or anything that
I need to get ready the night before so
that way when I wake up in the morning
it's not just an endless to-do list that
I'm waking up to it's just all already
done so try planning out or making your
lunch or making your outfit and putting
everything together and then of course
my last tip is probably just the most
basic tip that you will probably ever
hear but try getting to bed at a more
decent hour so that you're getting
enough sleep and create yourself a
little sleep regimen and sleep cycle and
try and stick to it so those were all of
my tips on how to be a morning person or
an early riser
I really do challenge you guys to try it
out and see if it makes you happier or
if you get used to it or if you end up
enjoying it it ends up being so much
better for you and it just you get so
much more done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys all in my next one bye guys
