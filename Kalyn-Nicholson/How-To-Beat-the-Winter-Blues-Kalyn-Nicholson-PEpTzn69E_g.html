little bit different than usual as you
all may know throughout the last year of
2015 I was kind of trying to find a
balance of what type of content I want
to be making and I've decided to just
kind of scrap the whole over
obsessiveness with thinking about it and
just create what's kind of relative to
what's going on in my life at the time
so sometimes there's gonna be more
sit-down videos other times there's
gonna be more cut-and-dry videos but all
I guess I'm trying to sum up here is
that there's gonna be just a whole lack
of Awesomeness on this channel and I
guess with that it'll eventually find
its own kind of theme yeah I guess I
really didn't need to ramble on until
you guys stopped but I like keeping you
guys updated just where I'm at life wise
and video wise and like YouTube and work
wise and all of that fun stuff so I'm
gonna stop rambling now because I am
just gonna jump ahead to the video so as
you guys know I've talked about my
depression and anxiety a lot before and
one of the things that often pops up a
lot is if I have seasonal affective
disorder kind of falling into like a
depressive state or a rut in the like
slower winter months and then as the
weather starts to get better so does
your mood now I've never been fully
diagnosed with that I have been
diagnosed with both anxiety and
depression so I'm not sure if that's
what it is because I would definitely
say my mood or my depression gets a lot
worse in the winter months but that said
I've had it happen to me in the summer
too so I'm not sure if that's what I
have but either way I thought it would
be a good idea to do this video where it
talks about how to get through the
winter blues because even if you suffer
from depression or even if you have
seasonal affective disorder or even if
you don't have either and sometimes the
winter can just get really dull and very
gray today I'm gonna give you guys like
eight tips that are gonna help push you
through the winter time and get ready
for the spring and summer and I felt
like this is a good video to go for
January cuz I feel like January is
definitely the most almost kind of Down
month I would say for my own person
experience I feel like there's no like
the holidays are over and we're right in
the smack dab middle it was our start of
winter really and I feel like this is
the month where we most need to be like
picking up our spirits and trying to get
happy and excited for what's all to come
in 2016 so I'm definitely a lot is said
let's jump in so first and foremost
daylight is your best friend one of the
first things I like to do in the morning
is open up my blinds and even though I
wake up before the Sun it can be a
little bit dark and depressing but with
time the Sun does come up and I like my
blinds open my curtains open whatever it
is want to get as much daylight as
humanly possible
and if you live somewhere that doesn't
get a lot of daylight there are actual
Sun lamps you can get and you can shine
them on you especially in the morning
time and it helps you wake up it's so
good for your mood it's good for
boosting your serotonin levels and
making you feel more bright and happy
open up your blinds open up your
curtains if there's like a sunspot in
your house at all have your morning
coffee there or like I said if you can't
really do that try looking into
artificial lamps that you can get and
this next one is going to be very
obvious and I know I say it all the time
but exercise and you don't have to do
the typical go to the gym exercise if
that's not the type of like thing you're
into I mean this is the perfect time of
year to start signing up for things like
yoga classes or if you like Zumba or if
you want to do cycling or even if you
don't want to necessarily leave your
house which it's best to take it from me
if you can sign up for something that
causes you to leave your house the more
you're leaving the better but if you are
someone that prefers to work out from
home then you should check into things
like the Kayla Stein's BBG workout that
is something that I recently download
and then I got a medicine ball and some
free weights for home and they take me
about 25 minutes and then your workouts
done the thing about working out
especially in the wintertime is it gets
the oxygen flowing in your blood it
boosts your serotonin levels it's gonna
make you feel good and feel a lot better
and obviously during the winter months a
lot of us tend to actually you know kind
of skip that on the diet start eating a
little bit more hearty foods and kind of
skipping out on exercise so it's really
easy to fall into more unhealthy habits
in the winter time so finding even just
like 20 minutes of exercise you can do
there's yoga videos you could watch on
YouTube it's free you don't even have to
pay for anything you don't have to go
out and buy an expensive mat you don't
to go out and get equipment or anything
just fine exercise that's going to work
for you and bonus points is that you
might have a six-pack by the time summer
rolls around so next and I have found
this to be one of the most helpful
things lately and kind of bringing me
out of the little rut that I've been in
and it is asking myself what am i
listening to
so that might sound funny but a lot of
the time you might not realize that all
the things that were absorbing and
soaking in every day really do affect us
on a more emotional level than you might
know so if you're listening to really
dark music in the wintertime and take it
from me if you've listened to my eight
Jax playlist at all you'll know that
they've been very kind of dark or kind
of like whimsical indie type music and
as much as I love that music the more I
listen to it the more I find I get into
that dark whimsical type of mood so you
have to ask yourself what are you
listening to you don't have to cut the
bad music or the rap music early
whatever you like to listen to that's a
little bit more like hardcore or dark
all you have to do is just kind of
sometimes maybe swap it out for a little
bit more of an upbeat song or better yet
like a positive audio bug during the day
I try and keep it a little bit more
happy with audiobooks or just like
country music or more pop or whatever it
is that kind of doesn't bring me down on
that level if you know what I mean so
maybe nobody's relating to this at all
but it does affect me very very very
very very easily so so this next one
might be a little bit hard for everybody
but there is an alternative and that is
to plan a vacation and if you can try
and plan one in the winter and try and
get down south if you can get some Sun
get some beach get some vitamin D on
your skin and some sand in your hair but
if you can't which I know a lot of
people can't you can always plan like a
little getaway close to you you could go
like for me I like to go up to Toronto
it's really close to where I live or
even if you can't do that plan a
staycation and that's actually really
easy to do you plan something that's
gonna be right at home or maybe at a
friend's house you can do it with your
boyfriend your husband your best friend
your sister your mom whoever it is grab
a bunch of movies or like feet soakers
or whatever it is that you plan on doing
board games something that's gonna grab
you and someone close to you or maybe
even more than one person and have like
a mini getaway but at home and this is
something that's affordable
and you don't have to take time off work
or school or whatever it is that you're
doing so if you can't go on a vacation
or have that vacation planned even in
like the spring time to look forward to
then plan yourself a staycation and
doing things like this they're gonna
keep you like excited for like the night
that's coming or the weekend that you
have planned or whatever it is it's
gonna get you excited and pumped about
it and even if you're just doing a
staycation it really does affect your
mood spending quality time with the
people close to you so I highly highly
recommend doing something like that plan
something fun and then you have
something to look forward to
so as for my next tip though it is the
winter time I am challenging you guys to
go outside this year I've been trying to
challenge myself to get out more even if
it's just taking Bentley for a walk do
something outside even if it's just a
five-minute brisk walk around the block
bundle yourself up throw some tunes in
or grab a hot chocolate or a tea and
just go for a little walk getting that
fresh air even in the winter time and
you know like walking around and
whatever and pretending that you know it
isn't negative 40 degrees Celsius
outside it will affect your mood just
getting outside and if you can try and
get outside within the first two hours
of waking up it's really gonna refresh
in that like sluggish feeling that you
have so if you can within the first two
hours of waking up even if you just go
outside walk to your car and walk back
do something just get outside and just
breathe a couple fresh just gulps of air
and then go back in and put your
slippers back on so this next tip is
something that I actually have done
since I've been back from Florida and
this is to surround yourself with
brighter colors our brains are instantly
affected by the things that we take in
all the time and that includes the
things that you're seeing so if your
house is very dark and gloomy odds are a
lot of the time you're gonna have a bit
of a dark and gloomy feel so if you can
change everything around you to more
brighter colors I also just like changed
my phone background to being something a
little bit more bright and fun and just
things like that I've been changing a
lot of the things around my room and it
makes me feel a little bit more like
bright and colorful in like the dark
winter month this is one of the easiest
tips you can do if you take one from all
of this
so start wearing a little bit more
brighter colors or you know put some put
your phone backgrounds to something a
bit brighter or put a nice bright
blanket on your couch or something that
brings in a little
more brightness and a little bit more
color so this next soup is my favorite
because I am all for taking up projects
and it is to pick yourself a winter
project it doesn't have to be anything
extravagant this could be anything from
purging your closet to you know setting
like a fitness goal for the end of the
winter like whatever it is that you want
to do give yourself a project to do in
the winter time so this is going to keep
your brain occupied its gonna keep you
kind of set on something and it's gonna
make you feel accomplished when you do
finish it so if you're looking a little
bit more long-term maybe you want to
learn to do a certain pose in yoga or if
you're looking for something to just do
this weekend to make you feel better
purge your closet cleaning your room
paint your house paint your room change
around your entire room that's something
I actually did when I got back from
Florida is I wanted like a new vibe or a
new feel for the new years so I changed
around my room and I instantly felt so
much better there's something about
waking up and having like a different
environment around you even though
you're in the same room little things
like that really do affect your mood
something you want to do something you
want to accomplish over the winter
months it can be short-term it can be
long-term it's going to keep your brain
occupied it's gonna keep you busy and
it's gonna make you feel good and
accomplished and like you're narrowing
in on something and that's what you're
focusing on you're not focusing on how
long it's gonna be before you can hit
the beach you're focusing on how you're
gonna get this winter project done I
think we can turn that flix off for like
an hour or two to you know work on
something if we want or you can keep on
watching Netflix because I'm not gonna
judge you and then my last and final tip
is to get cozy make your environment
around you you know welcoming and warm
and and kind of try to embrace winter as
best as you can if the whole time that
you're doing any of the tips before your
constant forefront thought is I hate
winter you're just never really going to
feel better so try and do all these tips
but at the same time get cozy and get
comfortable with winter it might not be
everybody's favorite season but if you
go out splurge on a nice book or a nice
blanket or something that's gonna make
you feel happy for the wintertime cozy
up put on your slippers put friends on
TV and just you know it enjoy the winter
while it's still here that is one thing
I've specifically done this year has
really tried to embrace winter for what
it is and though going to Florida and
coming back did not help
prior to going to Florida I was really
excited for the snow I was really
excited for the wintertime and how
beautiful it is and one of the things
I'm trying to change just in myself as a
person as I want to start seeing the
better in things and trying to look at
the positive out of everything so if you
can get cozy and get comfortable and try
and see the positive things about winter
or you know you can just cozy on up and
keep on watching my videos because I am
totally okay with that too so I hope you

getting through the winter blues be sure
