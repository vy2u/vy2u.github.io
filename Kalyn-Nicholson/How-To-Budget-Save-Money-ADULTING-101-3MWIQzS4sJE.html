extremely distracting because they're
reflecting the wind oh yeah
I coming out I figure they kind of add
it to the adult in five we were going
for but hey guys what's up and welcome
to the 24th day of Ito burr for today's
video i'm doing a video all about
budgeting and saving money and basically
learning how to be super frugal and yeah
this was something that was never really
fully explained or taught to me and with
doing research on better spending habits
better saving habits and also just
coming up with some ideas and habits on
my own i kind of came up with a system
that I like to follow when it comes to
saving my money and being a bit more of
an adult you know really quick if you
guys aren't falling you already be sure
to check out my Twitter Instagram I'll
pop them up on the screen here for in
the last week which is deeply upsetting
but that said there's still quite a few
more videos to go so definitely
subscribe and hit the notification bell
if you haven't already and on than that
let's jump into these money-saving tips
so first things first when it comes to
saving your money I like to follow kind
of like a minimalist budget it's just
like a really simple breakdown of how to
take your income and where it should all
be going so obviously the first thing
you need to do is figure out how much
money are you making on a monthly basis
that is your beginning point that is
your starter that is where it all began
from there ideally you want to map out
all of the things that are musts and
essentials now only you can decide kind
of what is an essential versus what is
you know a luxury to some cellphones
might be a luxury to others it might be
an essential for some a gym membership
might be laundry to others it might be
an essential so ideally you want to be
spending about 50% of your income on
your essentials which sounds like a lot
but when you think about it what
actually is all included in this ie your
rent or however much it costs you for
housing food and groceries to survive
fills like utilities or cellphones or
car bills whether you have to buy bus
passes or you know train tokens whatever
it is you have to kind of come up with
what are the things that are essential
for your day-to-day living this is also
where you can get creative you know
bringing down your cell phone bill by
changing your plan coming up with
plan so that you have like a set grocery
list which saves you money you can even
use apps to help with this like checkout
51 is the one that I use when it comes
to couponing in Canada it gives you a
bunch of coupons to go to grocery stores
so you can use apps like that too which
will also bring down your cost and when
it comes to your essentials you always
want to make your essentials fifty
percent or less and if you have to make
adjustments to your day-to-day living
become accustomed to fifty percent of
your monthly intake then it's gonna hurt
let's start making the cuts also really
important random tip to is to set aside
a day or create automatic payments when
it comes to your bills that way you're
never forgetting your never falling
behind and it saves your credit for the
future another tip that I had to learn
the hard way next when it comes to
budgeting is to try and take twenty or
more percent and put it into your
savings now this should only be done
after your essentials you should never
put twenty percent of your savings away
before you've paid your bills you've
paid your rent you've done all the
things that are essential to your
day-to-day living only after that's done
should just try and take twenty percent
of your income and put it towards your
savings you can be saving up for
retirement you know you could be saving
up for a car you could be saving up to
buy property or buy a condo you can even
just be saving up for a trip a new
camera or you know a makeup product that
you really want to get if you're younger
and you don't have bills and all of that
stuff yet you could even just be putting
20% of your part-time job wages a way to
go on a trip somewhere at the end of
high school or if you're a little bit
older and you have rent or you're in
college you can still try and put 20%
away for savings after college or for
paying off any school that you might
have and the long run if you're saving
20% more you're just gonna thank
yourself later when you're buying a
house earlier in life than you thought
or you're retiring in Hawaii and the
last category when it comes to budgeting
yourself is personal expenses and for
this it's always best to shoot for 30
percent or less this part of your budget
is what's going to make the most
difference because essentials are just
that they are essential we need to pay
those things to live but when it comes
to your personal spending shrinking this
down means putting more into your
savings pile which is in turn just gonna
make it better for your life later on
this is where you figure out what you
want versus what you need and the things
that you're willing to you know
sacrifice or cut back on for instance
there was a time in my life where I was
buying a Starbucks drink every single
morning it is a ridiculously close walk
to where I live and
every morning I would get up walk that
leg of Starbucks grab my drink come back
and start my work for the day and when I
started to add it up you know like 650 a
day on a lot of tank versus the coffee
that I can make from home
it was disgusting the amount of money I
could have been saving had I just been
making coffee at home the whole time an
important tip for this category too is
to make sure that you're tracking your
spending because our money is so
electronic now it can be so easy to be
mindlessly spending and not even
realizing it like when I was buying
those coffees every morning going up for
food is also a really big one that you
might not even realize how much money
you're spending on that not to mention
online shopping another mindless task
that you get wandering into at 2:00 a.m.
and then suddenly you don't know how you
spent all your spending money for the
month in one night there's a napping
good on your phone called mint that
helps you track all of your spending it
shows you where you're spending it it
helps you you know see your pattern or
you can just use you know a standard
notebook you can use the notes in your
iPhone and another huge tip that I do
for this section that has helped me out
the most is once I figure out how much
money I have left after my essentials
and my savings for the whole month I see
what I have left and I take it out in
cash this way I have physical cash on me
I'm not using my cards my spending isn't
mindless and once that cash runs out
that's all I have for that month
reverting to the old school ways of
using cash it's gonna be the only way to
keep you on par with your budget I mean
maybe not forever going but I do know
that for me what I wasn't taking out
what I had leftover to spend I was going
way over 30% when it came to personal
spending for the month so definitely
take a note of cash and keep track of
every single personal item that you tend
to spend or just keep track of all of
your expenses in general including your
bills in your rent be frugal but don't
be cheap be an adult but still have fun
and there you have it those are the tips
and tricks that I use when it comes to
budgeting and being an adult when it
comes to spending my money I hope you
