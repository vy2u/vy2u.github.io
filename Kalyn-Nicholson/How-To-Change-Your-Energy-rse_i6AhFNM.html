outside my apartment anyway what's up
guys and welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm doing another flop
with you guys I'm gonna be vlogging this
whole weekend
it is currently Friday August 18th I
woke up not too long ago actually slept
and I was going to go to a hot yoga
class this morning at 6:30 in the
morning
but I didn't get to bed last night until
like 1:30 I was actually at a dinner
last night it was a dinner on blonde
we're like the apparel everybody wears
all white there was free wine
but because of that I ended up getting
home decently late last night and it
also poured rain on all of us they give
us all these really cute umbrellas but
we still got pretty soaked I didn't get
to sleep till like 1:00 a.m. and then I
woke up three times throughout my sleep
last night so when my alarm went off
this morning I was like nope not doing
that 6:30 a.m. yoga but I did rebook a
class for 10:00 and then I actually am
getting my hair done today I was asking
you guys whether or not you believe I
should chop it all and a lot of you said
yes but I just don't know if I'm ready
to part ways with it yet oh my god is
like don't do it so it's currently 8:30
in the morning my hot yoga class isn't
till 10:00 so I'm gonna run downstairs I
have some parcels I need to pick up
thank you new highlighters for the fall
no camera charger for this vlog camera
because I forgot mine I need to make my
bed and then
good morning guys it's actually Saturday
now I'm just about to get into my jeeps
drop some Starbucks but I'll show you my
hair in just a second so I'm actually
just at Craigs right now he's still
asleep
and I am awake it's like 9 a.m. I woke
up at like 8:00 and I tried to hang out
for a while but then I was like you know
what I can't do this without caffeine so
I'm gonna run to Starbucks and grab a
latte and I'm gonna grab him an iced
coffee in hopes that it wakes him up coz
we're gonna go shopping today and then
we're gonna go to his cottage oh yeah
and you guys haven't even seen my hair
yet so what we ended up doing is I asked
her to put it like as white blonde as
possible but next time I go in I think
we're gonna have to give it like a
bleach bath so it's like this really
light like almost like a grayish toned
blonde and then we put a ton of layers
in it so that I can see what it would
look like if it was short and I think in
like 4 weeks I'm gonna go in and get it
cut so she was also like I would be very
afraid to cut your hair because it's so
long what if you hated it even though
that I am possibly have gotten tattoos
on a whim so I don't think cutting my
hair is as bad but also to like just to
see if this is something that I actually
really want because this is awesome but
that awkward middle phase is the worst
so it's like a big commitment to like 3
years of growing it out again and I
don't know comment below what you guys
think do you guys like the get short
side or do you guys like the long side
which is hard to see because the Sun
right now let me know what you think but
in the meantime I'm gonna go grab a
latte I now get a skinny vanilla latte
with blonde espresso and coconut mouth
and it's to die for it's actually insane
then I have some work emails to do well
Gregg sleeps and then we're gonna try
anyway cos but because dropping
you don't owe me big
we don't know what we don't know if
we're going to York filler York deal
I just want bath and body where we're
falls over yeah exactly the fall candles
are by to get to free fall shopping is
clothing and accessories though you
spent like $200 at the first place but I
got a new yoga mat you got to show you
at the end of it
you're now driving up to Gregg's cottage
we did some pretty hefty shopping a
little upset that we're not able to show
what we bought
although I did buy this sweater
it's like
kind of like white and gray I also do we
do go back so I've been needing a new
yoga bhakti yoga man that I've been
using it
ah guess I keep slipping all over it I
only got those a jacket
but I need to go shopping again tomorrow
Sydney to heat up hmm and I need to hit
up a bookstore
like the third Harry Potter because it's
finished reading the second sequel some
kind of starting in a little hungry
again
yeah you're gonna make me a bunch of you
will leave your veil
veggie burgers
really you're a very good barbecue right
you should be eggplant again he makes
really good egg please also crank bought
this jacket that I picked out I picked
it out I think that and he was so mean
because there's only one left and so I
was like fine you take it I'll pour away
and I wanted on me you tried it on I was
like you're like how does this look and
I stalled because I wanted to leave it
didn't look good so I could buy it but I
was like you look maybe I'll just let
him spend the money in that I can wear
it and you really yeah babe I'll lend it
to you and then we get back and we're
going to leave and I'm trying to wear it
and he wouldn't let me
I've left things before
SiC vintage jacket I'm very upset but
I'll settle for the sweater
what's up guys so it is actually now
Monday the clips that you just saw we're
all from yesterday in the day before
when we were at Greg's cottage I noticed
that I hadn't filmed an outro to this
vlog so I'm not even entirely sure how
much footage I even got for this vlog
hopefully you guys were thoroughly
entertained so being that it's actually
Monday August 21st I believe today it's
actually the day of the solar eclipse
it's about to start in 30 minutes I know
that it's kind of cliche where people
will make celestial events kind of
related to energy and fate and
manifesting and all of that stuff but I
truly do believe in a very uncommon in
the energy of our universe and the
energy of ourselves and the energy all
around us at all times and so with this
solar eclipse I honestly I truly do
believe it's a good chance to kind of
let go of a lot of things and make way
for some new energy and some new
perspectives maybe some new goals even
if you're watching this long after the
solar eclipse it's never too late to
kind of use use of things around you as
a shift in energy and even today waking
up for whatever reason I just felt kind
of renewed my energy just felt totally
different than it was feeling last
week's whether you believe in this stuff
or not you can see it as a bit of a
metaphor and those are about to change
things are about to shift and you're
allowed to let go of a lot of the things
in your life that are no longer serving
you toxic relationships bad habits the
need of approval from others the weight
that you put on your social media or
like acceptance or the weight that you
put on what it is for you to be
successful or now is a really good time
even just with the transition of seasons
coming up to let go of a lot of the
stuff that is in your life that may be
inhibiting you from you know being a
happier person and living the life that
you truly want or being the person that
you truly want to be and not only that
it gives us all the chance to make room
for the things and the new habits and
the new people in the new relationships
and the new experiences in our life
that's going to bring us to a happier
place and bring us to where we really
truly want to be so whatever it is
whether you want to list them down below
say them out loud or put them on a piece
of paper in front of you write down a
few things that you're willing to kind
of let go if you're wondering what mine
are caring so much what people think
it's not even really social media like
caring what people think it's more so
the people around me caring about the
choices and decisions and things that I
do and make and wondering how people or
extended people to me might think about
them and I need to I really want to nix
that and just be very confident in Who I
am and and realize that I don't like to
judge a book by it's cover so I would
hope that other people would kind of be
the same way stop putting so much weight
on what other people think the second
thing I want to let go of is definitely
this sense of anxiety over things that I
have no control over my anxiety has been
incredible lately but over the last two
or three weeks there's definitely been
some things that are completely out of
my control that have been stressing me
out and I need to learn to accept those
things and accept the fact that I don't
have control over them in order to let
them go and let go of the anxiety that
comes with them a third thing that I
want to let go of is self-doubt always
going into things feeling defeated
feeling like I'm gonna fail or feeling
like I am not good enough that's another
thing that's really been kind of getting
in my way a lot lately is a lot of
self-doubt and I don't want to be that
person I would rather be a more
confident person and you know just go
out things not even with like a
cockiness but just to go at things with
an open mind and think whether I fail er
I don't it's just an experience of life
and I shouldn't always strive for so
much perfection and put so much weight
in not kind of completing things the way
I like to my own standard to just live
and enjoy and try my best and accept
what whatever outcome comes those are
the things that I'm hoping this sort of
shifts with all of this energy changing
in the air and I want to know what you
guys are changing
leave a comment down below because I'm
definitely super interested in hearing
what you guys want to kind of push out
of your life and attract more of into
your life so with that I hope you guys
enjoyed this vlog and this little like
mini tiny coffee talk we're having at
the end of this I'm going to officially
be uploading vlogs every single Sunday
my life is honestly it's very low-key
it's very chill and sunday is also very
low-key and chill so what I'll just kind
of make sense
feel like Sunday is my favorite day of
the week we can come up with a name for
it that would be
but if you guys are excited for vlogs
going up on Sundays then just thumbs up
and other than that I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see all of
