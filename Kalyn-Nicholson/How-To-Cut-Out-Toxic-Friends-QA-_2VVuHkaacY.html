why my skull sweater today because this
is a Q&amp;amp;A so we are literally just gonna
be mad chillin let's just do this
hey guys welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm filming a Q&amp;amp;A with you
guys I posted a photo recently to
Instagram asking you guys what questions
you wanted to ask for a Q&amp;amp;A and let you
all eat but all of the cues that you
want is to my phone is also close to
morbid death so hopefully it lasts long
enough for us to get through this scroll
back to the very beginning back to does
you know it would be a lot smarter for
me to just do this on my laptop muchos
better if you guys aren't following me
already be sure to check out my
Instagram and Twitter so you guys don't
miss the next Q&amp;amp;A and also if you're not
part of the coast crew subscribe and if
you are hit the little valve so that you
guys know whenever there's a new video
although that Vela might get annoying
come October because there's gonna be
daily videos so little organ oh for
wants to know hey what make and model
and year is your Jeep just wondering so
my Jeep is a 2016 Jeep Wrangler it's in
the color rhino kind of looks black like
a deep grey with a tinge of blue to it I
wanted a black Jeep because hatch from
hush-hush had a black Jeep but when I
was going to check out the jeeps there
was the gray one there and a part of me
said before ever wanting a black one
that I wanted a gray one because the guy
in dreamcatchers name is gray so and I'm
not just being this weird thing that all
happened to work out and I got a great
one and if you've ever wondered my jeeps
name is Drizzy because remember my old
car it was gus-gus
now we've upgraded to Drizzy and we call
him Drizzy because drake and also
because my brother helped me name him
and that was the name that we decided on
so on your score Morgan Taylor with a
zero wants to know where do you most
want to travel - I love your travel
vlogs in all of your videos thank you so
much I think my top three places are
Italy Australia and Greece or Thailand I
can't really choose so those are my top
four let's just go with that that said
there's a couple trips in my near future
so you're gonna get more of those travel
vlogs soon Jay underscore Howland I'm
sorry if I completely butchered your
name for someone who lives alone how do
you keep from getting lonely /
unmotivated
Dargis then the face of being honest
with you guys there are definitely days
that I do get lazy and lethargic and
unmotivated for me and the biggest thing
I do I'm always setting new goals
there's never time like once I hit or
finish or complete a goal
I've already set a new goal and in some
ways I do it to a fault
I suddenly put so much pressure on
myself to try and do so many different
things that I honestly leave myself no
time or like chill time to do it but at
the same time I think if you can find a
balance of you know setting yourself
goals and setting yourself things you
want to do especially living alone you
have a lot more spare time setting
yourself some goals or some hobbies or
some things that you want to accomplish
is going to keep you on par and keep you
from just being super lazy and
unmotivated and like the flare jack all
the time so life with Kurt a square are
you traveling to next the last week of
September I'm actually going to be
traveling to San Francisco and then I
don't really plan on going anywhere in
October because of everything going on
with you Tober but that said when you
Tober ends it's like a big celebratory
thing for me because I worked so like
much on you tober that Greg and I
decided that we're going to venture off
and run away to Mexico for a week so
those are the next two trips that I had
planned tisha Guillory Aguilar asks what
was your biggest dream as a kid by the
way thanks for being my inspiration I
love you as a kid on my biggest dream I
had multiple dreams like at one point I
wanted to live in Africa research
animals in the wild and things like that
and then I also wanted to be a school
teacher at one point and I also used to
carry around a sketchbook and like
sketch really bad dresses and I remember
vividly one of them having vines all
over them but I really wanted to like be
a clothing designer and I was going to
name my brand I lack which is my name
backwards I even wanted to be a writer
when I was a kid funny enough the first
story I ever wrote was in grade I think
it was in grade 5 or 6 and I remember
showing it to my grandpa and my dad and
them being like what this is so good
probably horrible but to be honest with
you guys that's probably the only reason
why I thought it was okay to write a
book later on in life was because I was
like well my Papa said it was great in
grade 6 so it's gotta be better now Kim
bro-bro royally
I learned I feel like there should just
be a whole video of me trying to
pronounce words asks how do you cut
negative people or toxic friends out of
your life I love you possibly a coffee
top video so if you guys wanna I can do
a full coffee talk on toxic people and
friends and things like that but my
quick and fast advice for you when it
comes to cutting toxic people out of
your life is I think for one I'm just
I'm also just not very much of a
conflict person I don't like to start
conflict with people maybe that makes me
unconfrontational probably true my
biggest thing when it comes to toxic
people is I just do it I just the no
excuse no no real rhyme or reason I just
make myself super busy doing other
things that are more positive and
uplifting for my leg and I fill my time
up with people that I find super you
know positive and motivating to be
around and I just stop giving my time to
people that I find toxic or that kind of
suck the life out of you you don't want
I need a rhyme or reason you don't need
to start a fight you don't need to like
be like these are all the things you did
wrong because there might be a chance
that maybe you're doing something wrong
or maybe it's something that's going on
and them or they're live but if anyone
is being a toxic source in your life I
think you should just fill up your time
with uncocks ik things it's positive
motivating uplifting ping just stop
having time and stop giving time to them
so my god Chhabra wants to know which is
the one book that you can read to any
time I love you I love you too and the
one book that I could pretty much read
anytime anywhere is the similar you're
not giving a you are a badass and
I'm officially adding girlboss to that
because I just finished girlboss today
especially with starting codes I feel
like I can pick up girl boss and just
read that at any points and then maybe a
non-fiction a book I could read it any
time is probably the Harry Potter series
so Mikayla Peraza wants to know what is
the best way to stay focused on your
goals I love watching all of your videos
thank you so much and my advice is
staying focused on your goals is to
surround yourself with your goals I have
posted notes I have dream boards I have
like notebooks filled of lists and I
also surround myself with people who
know about my goal I think if you set a
goal and then it goes out of sight it's
out of mind and you stop feeling
motivated to conquer it I think
you want something bad enough you
surround yourself with it you tell
yourself that you believe you can have
it and then you go for it and you put
that bowl around you as much as possible
whether it's getting healthy whether
it's writing a book whether it's
starting something new set your goal and
then put it everywhere around you to
constantly remind yourself to go after
it and constantly remind yourself of
what you're working towards Mele
underscore esti wants to know what do
you like most about fall when it boils
down to it I think my favorite thing
about fall is the whole comfort of it
the smells
the color is the clothes the coziness
the stream lights time of year that
Halloween and candy and worm-like
beverages just everything about the
feeling and the comfort of fall and I
think that's why it's my favorite season
is because it's to me the coziest season
so Jamie underscores connects wants to
know how do you manage to have a
boyfriend be productive in work and/or
school have a social life and still live
a healthy lifestyle first of all I don't
go to school I was thinking about it but
girl I would have had no time to do that
but that said I think the only reason
why it might seem like I have a good
balance is because what you guys see is
the end of the day cut up
edited version of my life what you guys
don't see is a lot of the times I break
down sometimes I abandon my to-do list
sometimes I completely have no balance
to my life and Greg literally has to
tell me to stop working and to chill out
that's that I I feel like a huge part of
being able to cover so many fronts as I
feel like I maybe do is due to time
management and planning I think if I
wasn't so obsessed with planning and
organizing things I wouldn't be able to
utilize as much of my time as I tend to
but that said I feel like life is just a
constant wave of feeling super
productive and like you're carrying all
these plates and balancing all of them
and all of those plates crash into the
ground and hitting like little pitfalls
where you have to remote of it yourself
again and I think that that's just kind
of the wave of everybody's life I don't
think there's anyone that manages
everything at all times it's totally
normal to not balance all of those
things and it's totally normal to go
through pits of your life where you
maybe stop working out or or you're
falling a little bit behind in school
those things aren't normal
don't stress yourself out or make
yourself feel guilty for not being able
to juggle all those things the minute
that you get over the guilt and the
struggle that you feel with it it makes
it easier to accept where you are and
find that balance to get yourself back
on track so sorry vault nine asks what
do you value most of Greg and how do you
resolve your disagreements um I hope he
doesn't watch this because this will
just puff up his ego there's so many
things that I value at Greg I think one
of the most things that I value about
him is that he has got such a capacity
to care for people and a lot more of a
lone wolf spent a lot of time alone
growing up I was always kind of like
that even though I had people I always
was kind of very focused on things I was
doing and goals I wanted to accomplish
what's so inspiring to be around him and
see his capacity to care about other
people and to love other people and I
also just value the fact that even
though we have our differences he
accepts me for who I am but not only
just accepts me for who I am but I can
tell that he genuinely likes me for who
I am not only do I feel like I can be
myself I also and feel more inspired to
be myself so those are two things I
value most about him getting over our
disagreements wait we don't have very
many but the times that we do disagree
it tends to be when we both start to go
a little bit on the selfish side like
I'm thinking about how things affect me
he's thinking about how things affect
him and the way we always tend to get
over it is we stop and we think about
how things affect the other person and
you let the way you feel in love and
care about somebody else hold a higher
priority than the hurt that you feel and
suddenly it just kind of puts things
into perspective
so I mean there's like a million other
things I could say here but in terms of
keeping this Q&amp;amp;A short I'll move on so
Edel with shin or uestion I'm so sorry I
feel like I'm totally screwing up all
your names but what is your happy place
at the moment where do you go when you
feel a little low
or when you have to be inspired that's a
really good question I feel like if I'm
being honest with you guys my happy
place is my apartment I am such an
introvert in the sense that being home
by myself is how I recharge my batteries
so when I'm feeling really drained or
when I'm feeling really low and
uninspired and just really like at my
wit's end the way that I recharge and I
get inspired and my the way I literally
sparked my happiness again is I shut
down my phone I shut down my computers
in my laptop I light up all my candles
I'll clean my apartment and I'll just
like move things around a little bit and
just doing that and and having my
apartment and my space clean and and
fresh and then just sitting there and
enjoying the essence and the coziness of
it is all I need to kind of feel
inspired and feel happy and motivated
again and I think that's a super
important thing I can do a whole video
on this but I think it is so important
to make sure that your environment is a
happy place for you and there's so many
different ways tips and tricks to do
that but I think that if you can make it
so that your space your bedroom your
apartment or your house is your happy
place or your your space to recharge
then it makes it so much easier to
constantly feel you know inspired happy
and motivated when you've surrounded
yourself with a certain energy that
gives you that and so that is definitely
my happy place or one of my happening
places so Allen hkk and my girl Ellen I
say this because I see you on Twitter
all the freakin time Ellen wants to know
do you want to get married and have a
family in the future and how many kids
do you want love you lots
I definitely do want to get married and
have kids in the future I want two kids
I would love either two boys or a boy
and a girl I always pictured myself as a
kid having only boys and I wouldn't hate
it like if it ended up being me Greg
Bentley and two little boys and that's
totally cool Greg in mind you wants four
kids which he's not gonna be the one
pushing without so that is up for debate
I don't think that I would get married
or think about having kids anytime soon
but it is an exciting thought to think
about and it's definitely something I
want for my future
so come fly away from here wants to know
can you
I'm doing YouTube for the rest of your
life I love your videos you are so
inspiring if you choose around I can
promise you guys right now I don't think
I'll ever stop making content I think I
commented back to somebody the other day
on YouTube over there like are you doing
youtuber this year which one I invented
you Tober heck yes I'm doing youtuber I
think honestly there's gonna be a day
where it'll just be like a holographic
video and I'll be old and wrinkly
wrapped up in blankets scarves bringing
my pumpkin spice latte to bingo I just
don't see myself ever not making YouTube
videos if YouTube is still around you
best believe I will be vlogging with you
guys all the way to the old-age home
janna 23 Diggy wants to know who is your
role model and how would you describe
your style love you
I have multiple role models I I wouldn't
say I have like necessarily one I think
I gained kind of inspiration from a ton
of people especially people like you
know the Jensen sharrows and the Sophia
Amoruso is that right girl boss and you
are a badass those are like Supergirl
power I also find people like Miley
stars to be extremely you know
motivating and inspiring I find I'm a
Watson to be extremely motivating and
inspiring I find Taylor Swift to be
super motivating and inspiring I even
find Rachael Monica from friends to be
super motivational and inspiring as well
as Lorelai and Rory Gilmore to be
motivational and inspiring there are so
many like girls that I could just
combine into one and I would say that
that would be my ultimate role model
because there's so many little bits and
pieces from all of them that I find to
be super inspiring and that I kind of
use as my own sense of inspiration to be
myself and then in terms of my style how
would I describe it I think I would
describe my style to be kind of like
grungy boho chic a little bit if you
were to take like a punk rocker and like
a super chic like Barbie like freak furs
and bowties and you were just like that
would be I think myself so gonna answer
one more question and call it a day
because I feel like I've been filming
forever so Lilly it dot wher wants to
know how did you start doing what you
love and didn't
what people think by the way you're a
huge inspiration thank you in terms of
how I just did what I love I think a
part of it is that even when I was
younger I always kind of did things that
I wanted to do for the sake of doing
them where my parents would tell me no
and I would do it anyway but I also
think a huge part of it came from the
fact that it was the only thing that
brought me happiness and true happiness
I can always tell when I'm faking it and
what I'm actually feeling it when I was
trying so hard to fit in and when I was
trying so hard to be light I was the
most unhappy had ever been I think I had
just kind of got over giving a crap if
anyone was gonna say anything and I just
went for it and any time someone did say
something it obviously hurt but I just
kind of let it roll and just kept doing
what brought me a sense of happiness at
the end of the day I think of you
wholeheartedly believe in something then
it's really hard for other people to
tear you down and so if there's
something you're wanting to do if
there's something you love if there's a
passion you have and you're afraid to go
for it based on what other people think
you have to ask yourself what do you
think like is it gonna bring you
happiness because if the answer is yes
and it's doing nobody any harm at the
end of the day then you need to stop
putting so much weight and giving
everybody else the control and you need
to take it back for yourself and just go
for it because anyone that has anything
negative to say about it isn't a direct
reflection on how that person feels
about themselves and the life around
them or the life that they're building
and it has nothing to do with you and I
think if you stay authentic and you stay
true and you go after your passions and
your goals with like hell on fire fury
but don't forget to turn around and be
kind and compassionate to other people
even if they don't show you that same
respect kind of ultimately end up
winning at life I think you'll find
growth and happiness come a lot easier
to you that way and suddenly you'll find
that you're not only accomplishing your
goals you're setting new ones that you
never thought you would so that would be
my advice so that is it for today's Q&amp;amp;A
there are so many questions that I
didn't get to you but mind you I do live
streams every single Wednesday so maybe
I'll answer some
these on my livestream aside from that I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I love
you guys to the moon aback and I won't
bore you by talking anymore so I'll just
see you guys all in my next video bye
guys some body won't told me the world
is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest
tool in the shed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
