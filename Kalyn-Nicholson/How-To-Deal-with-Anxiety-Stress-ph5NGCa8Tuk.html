my channel for today's video I am going
to be doing in a vice video with you
guys slash coffee talk so make sure you
guys go make a cup of tea or coffee I do
not have one with me right now because
funny enough it is actually 1 o'clock in
the morning right now I don't know if
this happens to any of you guys but I
tend to get very easily like uninspired
or unmotivated when I'm doing the exact
same thing so many times in a row if
that makes any sense changing up my
routine and that's why it's 1 a.m. and
I'm filming right now because I'm going
to sleep in tomorrow which is something
I don't normally do and stay up late
tonight but do you know if that actually
ties into the subject that I'm going to
be talking about today extras' and
anxiety um but there's also so many
other things that has to do with anxiety
and depression that I want to talk about
too so those will probably be in future
coffee talks so today's video is more so
based on the correlation between stress
and anxiety and having like an
overwhelming plate ow I get through it
and just yeah basically things that I've
just been working through even just in
the past week I have learned to manage
my anxiety so much better than I used to
but I am still somebody that when I feel
like there's so many things happening at
once and I don't have any sense of
control of any of it that is when my
anxiety starts to freak out I actually
kind of started to happen to me last
week when I started falling behind in
Utah burr and there were things that
were coming up in deadlines coming up
that I was getting stressed and anxious
about that were unrelated to you Tober
and then just like everything seemed to
happen at once like Bentley ended up
getting sick I really need to get like
an oil change in my car just like
everything started happening all the
same time and I can feel my anxiety just
starting to climb I had to make a
conscious decision not to let that
happen
not that suppressing it is going to help
in any way but I had to redirect my
energy I had to redirect my thoughts and
so that's kind of like the struggle I
had through the week I've learned for
what works for me anyways is when I'm
super anxious about things instead of
asking why if I ask what I feel so much
more in charge I feel so much more in
control and then all of a sudden I find
this strength and motivation to just do
it just get done get it out of the way
whatever it is that stressing me out
figure it out and by that I mean instead
of city
being like why is this all hitting me at
once why is this all happening to me at
once why why why the why like why did
that happen why does the world hate me
why is everybody out to get me this is
the situation in front of me what am I
going to do about it not why is it
happening what can I do this is what I
can do about the situation then I do it
and if I ask myself what can I do about
it and there's absolutely nothing I can
do about a certain situation that seems
to be really stressing me out I have to
and it takes a while but I have to
really really visualize like putting it
down and walking away from it and
letting it go because obviously if I
can't do anything to change there's no
point in me carrying that baggage
there's no point in me carrying that
weight and yeah sometimes I put it down
and then all of a sudden I realize I'm
thinking about it again I'm stressing
about it again you're not gonna be able
to just completely you know like retrain
your brain to just let things go
every time you feel those stresses
coming back or you feel yourself kind of
picking that anxiety back up meditate do
whatever you got to do to find your Zen
and just visualize putting it back down
and walking away from it and I'm a
really good thing you can do in terms of
like when things are seeming to stress
you out or you feel like there's so many
thoughts happening at once that you
don't know how to decipher them or what
you should be worried about what you
shouldn't be worrying about someone once
told me to think about thoughts almost
like clouds and they're passing by and
you don't need to stop and focus in on
one cloud you don't need to keep one
cloud above your head you can let the
cloud just breathe right on behind you
look at them as just like bubbles or
thoughts that are just passing by and
you don't cling to any of them it's a
lot easier to let it just kind of flow
away the other mindset that I find has
been super helpful for me in terms of
just like working through the little
bout of anxiety that I've been having
lately is to remind yourself that things
are happening for you and not to you and
what I mean by that is if you look at
everything that happens in your life as
part of the journey not as something
that's throwing a wrench in your plans
then it's so much easier to accept
things as they are for instance I lost a
bunch of footage that had to do with a
video for you Tober that poopies super
far behind and I was super stressed out
about it and I was freaking out about it
and then I realized freaking out isn't
going to get me the footage back so
instead of freaking out I decided okay
I'm gonna stop I'm gonna film this video
I'm just gonna redo it and then the
video that I ended up refilling ended up
being better than the one that I had
originally filled so I could have looked
that is happening for me it actually
ended up making it so that the video I
ended up putting out was so much better
than the first one I had filmed anyway
and not only that dealing with that
entire situation and how quickly I was
able to just change my mindset into
being like okay instead of freaking out
let's just refilm it is making it so
much easier for me the next time
something like that happens to get even
faster at redirecting my thoughts and
redirecting my energy to being
productive in those types of situations
I know it's so much easier said than
done and when it's time to put actions
into words it can be so hard to keep
ourselves from being sucked into that
negativity you start thinking
catastrophic ly and you start believing
all of these terrible things about
yourself about the world about your life
and then it's so easy to just continue
to spiral downwards the faster we can
stop that spiral the faster we can catch
ourselves doing that and the faster we
can redirect our thoughts and our energy
the easier it is to manage having
anxiety and it's never going to fully go
away and sometimes it's going to be
easier to do it than others you just
have to have faith that it's all
happening for the right reasons and
right when it's supposed to and that in
itself is something that I think I've
learned this year in general if funny
enough I get asked by you guys a lot
like what my religion is or what I
believe in and things like that I like
to believe that the universe has some
sort of plan and that the universe is on
your side the universe is on my side and
everything that happens in our life is
to teach us some sort of valuable lesson
that we're going to need later on even
the bad things have some good and
they're going to lead me to the better
things that I can stop that catastrophic
belief that I'm crumbling or that
everything's going to fall apart or my
world is ending and I can see it for
what it is and it's just a bump in the
road it's just a lesson to be learned a
lot of what you believe in you have to
have faith in something because having
faith in a better tomorrow having faith
in whatever is happening in your life
and having faith that you are valuable
and worth good things and good things
are going to happen to you that's going
to be what pulls you through the darker
times that's going to be what pulls you
out of those anxious thoughts and those
mind pitfalls it's going to be what
pulls you out of that and makes you see
that you can handle it you can fight you
can battle it matter what your going to
come out so much stronger every single
time these sort of things are thrown
your way so hopefully you guys can take
a little something from my experience
and if you guys have any tips or
or anything like that that has to do
with dealing with stress or anxiety be
sure to leave it down below also guys
really quick just make sure you guys
take care of yourselves and you are kind
to yourself some of your worst days is
already so far past you and you survived
those so you can survive anything love
