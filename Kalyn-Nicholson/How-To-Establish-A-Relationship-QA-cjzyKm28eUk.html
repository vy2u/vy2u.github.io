stocked up on some basmati rice I picked

butter like 3 or 3 weeks ago and I ate
the whole tub in 3 days this is one
thing that I need to like I have to buy
sporadically or else I will be immensely
obese if you're like my favorite
crackers or like pretzel chips bananas

milk these are like my favorite frozen
vegetables you guys are going to see I
use these in my lazy hack stir fry so
those are the frozen veggies I get you
have to get the Italian ones
oh good so yeah that is my first rehaul
and then i'm going to work out in a bit
I don't know where the day is
progressing but it's going to press
we were staying impacted together with
batteries and I saw out the screws take
this in a job right now cut on things
that we can work this down on service I
don't know whatever I thought how could
I live all by yourself and I'm wasted
for come on now easily
now go down together anything no say
that I was clever to go down
and we go down together okay okay
everything nestled in the oven let's go
okay so going on 5:00 p.m. I am about to
jump in the shower since I am like
sweaty and disgusting I feel like this
is such a repeat of yesterday's vlog I
have to shower and get ready because a
friend of mine is coming over for dinner
for today's workout I just did the
elliptical again and all I do on the
elliptical is 30 minutes and I start at
resistance 12 and then each minute I
count down to resistance 3 stay there
and then at the very last minute of the
10-minute mark pump your legs backwards
and then when it hits 20 minutes go all
the way back up to 12 and do it again
and I confusing the crappity guys
because I just confused the carpet of
myself so I did a couple circuit which
you guys on camera and yeah or anything
else I have to do today
No then get this no sense - jihad need
to get in say oh no no learner's get two
pieces thank you
thank you so LM ready it's get the
tumblr Tuesday okay seeing that it's
Tuesday I figured I would do some wear
shoes day live with you guys be a slob
versus doing it on tumblr because I'm in
such a rush today open up the questions
and see what we got do what we're
working with so an anonymous question
says hey Carolyn love your vids want to
ask what's your favorite season of the
year and my favorite season of the year
is without a doubt fall summer is
definitely a close second but there's
something about fall that just I don't
know it owns a part of me
Anana says Kaelyn my credit crush said
he wasn't ready to be in a full
relationship but he brought the idea of
a relationship with no strings attached
should I go for it lots of love kN
that's a toughy I feel like it all
depends on whether or not you're okay
with being in a relationship with no
strings attached you're looking for
something a little bit more serious like
if you want to be in a legitimate
relationship you want there to be
strings attached
friends don't do this hoping that it
will eventually lead there he's being
upfront and honest of you and saying
listen like I don't want a relationship
and that sounds kind of potentially
dangerous if you have feelings already
involved but it really boils down to if
that's something you're looking for I
would set your standard and if he can't
meet that standard then he's not the one
for you there's someone out there that's
better for you and knows how incredible
you are so someone wrote I just watched
your updated version of depression and
anxiety and I recall you saying that
things get better and that there is
always hope how do I gain hope in an
unfortunate circumstance so it seems
like there's no use for any brighter
future so I mean what I say there's
always hope there's this quote and I'm
totally going to butcher it but it's
something along the lines of you don't
like something change it and if you
can't change it change the way you see
it that shift the perspective and also
not putting so much weight on that time
to look at it from a different
perspective if there's nothing you can
do to change it and then also I have
this like go-to saying that I've been
using lately every time I just feel like
nothing's ever going to be good or like
if I'm anxious or anything like that and
it's there's like three sayings the
first one is don't half-ass the moment
meaning like whatever moment is going on
in front of you don't half-ass it stop
using that moment that's happening right
now like raise a second to be thinking
about things that you
have no control over do whatever is
going on right in front of you be
present second one is it's not a big
deal and that is like something that
really helps me everything feels like
it's a big deal with my anxiety so when
I tell myself it's no big deal it's like
that instant I say to myself the
pressure just weighs off and then the
third one is life is good
so if you say those three things like
don't half-ass the moment it's not a big
deal
life is good you instantly feel like a
sliver of Hope no matter what situation
you're in that said I'm going to jet off
now I'm going to go make some dinner and
hang out for the night and then edit
this vlog and get it up to you guys I
hope you guys enjoyed today's vlog and
I'm going to see you guys all again
tomorrow because it's going to be day
three of the daily vlog Challenge series
that I'm doing yeah
so I love you guys coming back thank you
guys so much watching and I will see you
guys all in tomorrow's video bye guys
a change of the insulated I'm so into
you now I wanna be more than a friend
you know when they come into my baby
girl in the energy småland I'll bring
the flowers from the 90s and 2000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
