I'm in the wrong direction
hey guys I don't welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm going to
be talking to you guys all about finding
your signature stat I felt like the
Kalin's closet section of YouTube needed
a new video is actually requested from a
subscriber to talk about like how to
find your style just unlike tips tricks
and hacks on how to do that if you guys
aren't following me already I'm going to
put my Twitter in my Instagram right
here on the screen I'm always posting
outfit pictures and stuff to both my
Twitter and my Instagram so definitely
be sure to follow me and if you're new
to my channel then click the little
subscribe button that's gonna pop up on
the screen here I'm just gonna take off
all my lipstick by the end of this video
so without further ado let's find out
how to find our signature style so tip
number one is going to be to look around
and when I say look around I mean get
inspired go onto Pinterest go on a
tumblr go on do we heart it type in
fashion type in outfit ideas if you're
not a how-to percent sure what your
style is yet I suggest just typing in
very general terms every single photo
you see that you're like damn I want to
look like that whatever you're using
hard at pin it on re blog another really
good way to do this too is that there
are any style icons you guys have famous
person or youtuber anything like that
that you know you really like their
fashion sense then type their name into
again Pinterest we hard at tumblr all of
those things and start pinning a bunch
of their photos to and kind of take note
of what their style looks like so then
step number two is to label what's in
front of you so now that you've you know
collected a bunch of photos and outfits
and inspirations take a step back look
at it as a whole and start coming up
with words that kind of describe all of
the outfits you're seeing what I like to
call my fashion sense is like a boho
Beyonce like somewhere in between boho
Beyonce chic type thing you know what I
mean take a piece of paper look at all
the photos of the outfits in front of
you and just start writing down words
that come to mind when you look at these
outfits take note of what colors you're
seeing in these outfits take note of
what are the like staple pieces in these
that you love like is it the top that
you love is it the combination of both
the top at the bottom is it the dress is
it the makeup that's put with that
outfit really take note start to
completely critique analyze all of the
photos that you pin so step three is to
then go to your closet and see what you
have and
really good way to do this is to take
every single article of clothing that
you own take it off the hangers out of
the drawers off the shelves and throw it
all into the middle on the floor on your
bed once you've done that grab all of
your favorite statement pieces like
everything that you're like this is a
go-to for me this is something I really
really love this is something that
reminds me of a photo that I saw that I
really liked for their outfit take all
of those and hang those up once you've
picked out all of the favorite things
that you own in your closet look at
what's left and ask yourself if it
matches your favorite things that you
hung up or if it matches the photos or
outfit inspiration that you kind of
found with the photos if you're noticing
that you have a few pieces that are like
super boho but everything else is super
chic or really really girly and frilly
but everything else you have is a little
bit more hipster like things like that
start recognizing what pieces aren't
fitting within your wardrobe odds are
there's a piece that doesn't match with
the rest it's obviously a style that
interests you but that you don't feel
100% comfortable in so that might be why
you bought that thing but then never
really got around to wearing it or don't
really know what to piece it with this
is also a really good time to to start
picking out certain colors that you like
to theme off of now I do have quite a
bit of color in my closet but I always
tend to go for blacks um black is
definitely my number one color I would
say after that I would say it's either
neutrals or gray so anything like this
or nude or gray tones anything like that
and then after that I would definitely
say it's more White's and like peachy's
um and like lilacs and such personally I
wouldn't go more than like maybe eight
colors for your closet that might seem a
little strict you guys don't have to
stick to that start shopping smart once
you organize your closet you're now
going to have a better idea when you go
to shop online or you go to shop at
stores what colors you're looking for
what Styles you're looking for and also
if you do have like a board of outfit
inspiration that you made on Pinterest
sweetheart it or tumblr you're going to
know what kind of pieces you're looking
for from those photos if you guys want
to part two to this video where I kind
of go through my own closet and clear it
out and kind of show you guys my
personal style then just thumbs up this
video or let me know down below and I
will definitely film a part two so step
number four is to some NAPA photo
time you're wearing any sort of outfit
that you feel like you are on cloud nine
in like you feel like you are Beyonce
you are just rocking it this is so you
you feel like you've fully expressed
yourself through this outfit snap a
photo of it save it on your phone or put
it on the computer and then put it onto
your like tumblr your boards or whatever
and then not even know that that actual
outfit is in your closet and it's a
go-to outfit for you once you organize
your closet or while you're organizing
your closet throw outfits on and see if
you like how they fit your body see if
you compare it with other things in your
closet and snap a bunch of pictures that
you really like under the clothes that
you already have so step number five is
to find your signature thing and again
this doesn't even have to be just
clothes cuz style is about your whole
appearance so whether it's a certain way
you wear your hair or that you always
wear fit-and-flares or that you always
wear super tight clothes or maybe you
like ripped up jeans maybe you like
black leggings maybe you like whatever
it is find one signature thing it
doesn't mean you have to wear it every
single outfit for instance I find mine
would definitely be like my black
leather jacket I definitely wear it
pretty much with every single outfit
either that or sneakers I also really
like to wear sneakers not want to
wearing a dress like my casual go to his
sneakers mine on casual go to is like my
black leather jacket step number six is
going to be to play up your assets if
you know you have super long lean legs
then make your wardrobe or your
signature style show off your legs if
you know you have killer boobs show off
your killer boobs if you want to show
off like your collarbone your shoulders
your arms your back your butt whatever
it is that you love about your body find
what it is and play it up once you know
the types of clothes really play off
your assets versus the ones that aren't
as flattering on you that makes it so
much easier when you go to shop that you
know what looks good on you you know
what doesn't you know that you like a
certain leg for me I find when it comes
to showing off anything I definitely go
for legs I like to show off my legs more
than I like to show off anything else
honestly I think it also comes from the
fact that I do have a leg tattoo but
keep that in mind too if you guys have
tattoos that you want to show off like
let that be like your thing let that be
okay I know that I like my hemlines to
be higher than my tattoo and that's kind
of how I go about it step number seven
is going to be complete the look so it's
not all just about clothes it's also
about
like you know the way you do your hair
and your makeup and don't ever think
that you have to have a signature style
but for those of you that are trying to
kind of make a theme or a pattern or
express yourself through your clothes
and who you are start looking at makeup
and hair for these outfits too like how
would you style your hair will start now
if it's how would you wear your makeup
with certain outfits do you like to go
more grungy do you like to go more
neutral with your makeup more soft and
summery like do you like to get your
nails done do you like to have your
nails painted do you like to leave them
completely not painted like and this can
be really fun too because that's when
you start getting into having like more
of a makeup routine or a hair routine
that's your go-to most of the time and
it doesn't mean you can't change it up
you can always change it up you can even
change your whole style six months later
if you really want to and the last and
final step is step number eight and it's
to know yourself you're really
struggling to come up with a style or
anything if you're noticing you're all
over the place in terms of what outfits
you really enjoy
then go based on your personality and
you know you're a little bit more like
cute and girly and like quiet then odds
are you're probably going to dress a
little bit more it's a good comparison
for this you're going to dress a little
bit more ariana grande than you are
Rihanna so when it comes to your
personality let that shine through your
clothes be authentic be yourself let
your self shine through finding your
signature style is all about expressing
yourself not masking who you are or
pretending to be anybody else because
who you are is already amazing on your
own it might sound weird but dress like
your personality if hold your head up
high and walk like a rock star because
no matter what you're wearing you're
going to look amazing in it it's all
about being confident and being yourself
and being authentic so I hope you guys

signature style if you guys have any
