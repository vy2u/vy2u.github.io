welcome back to my channel for today's
youtuber video I'm going to be doing a
coffee talk with you guys so for today's
coffee talk it was a highly requested
subject to cover kind of like being
confident in yourself and also how to
not care what people think I know my
kisses right now No thank you this topic
is actually super relevant to even my
own life right now because it's been
something that's been kind of playing
around in my head with even just YouTube
and just life in general
like recently I've been more critical of
myself than I normally am let me give
you a like a good analogy you learned it
the other day that with writing we go
through like a process of going through
a creative mode and then a critical mode
and then a creative mode and then a
critical mode creative you come up with
ideas and you're not being critical of
them just yet and then once you get
those ideas then you go in and you're
critical of them and you analyze like
okay well what is really a good idea as
he was teaching us this I kind of was
watching being like wow that's not even
just about writing that's kind of just
like in terms of life I'll go through a
phase where I feel super creative and
super inspired and then you kind of go
through phases where you're more
critical of yourself not really doing
things that inspire you or make you feel
good you're just constantly critical of
yourself you're constantly analyzing
yourself I don't know if any of you guys
might relate to that but that's
definitely how I find my mindset goes as
I come in and out of these waves of
being super inspired and creative and
not caring what anyone thinks of me and
feeling so sure of myself to going into
critical mode where all of the sudden
I'm overanalyzing I'm wondering if what
I'm doing is a good idea I'm conscious
of what other people might be thinking
of me and then I struggle and then I try
and get back out of that mindset only to
fall back into the creative and then
back into the critical and I I feel like
it's kind of inevitable that this is
going to happen to all of us need to
have that sort of self dialog in order
to you know push ourselves to withhold
our responsibilities or to decide what's
good for us what's bad for us so we do
need to be a little critical of
ourselves but we definitely go overboard
on the critic
side and sometimes it can be
ridiculously hard to get back into that
creative mode or you know that positive
mindset and that self-fulfilling mindset
and the very confident version of
ourselves it is important to not
necessarily judge but to definitely
analyze ourselves to make sure you know
that we're not walking through life
completely blinded by the way that we
affect other people or you know just to
be sure that we're constantly checking
in with ourselves and feeling good about
ourselves but sometimes it can be way
too easy to go overboard and become
judgmental of ourselves and rip
ourselves to shred sometimes for me I
feel like the second I find one solid
thing that's kind of bothering me
then sudden I'm judging everything I do
I'm over questioning and over analyzing
everything I do I've suddenly lost all
self-confidence some of the meanest
things that have ever been said to you
or said to you from you when we make a
mistake or we screw something up and we
get so hard on ourselves and so mean
inside our heads that we beat ourselves
to nothing like I'm guilty of this I'm
pretty sure all of us have guilty of
this it's not an easy topic to talk
about with other people like how do you
explain that your mindset has just been
super negative you can't rely on anybody
else to make you feel good and confident
about yourself it's something that has
to happen within the best part is is
that yeah you don't have to rely on
anyone else to fix this you could fix
this yourself right now like right at
this minute we all know that nobody
wants to be that way nobody wants to
feel terrible about themselves I feel
like for me anyway the fastest fastest
and most effective way to put an instant
halt to that is to completely stop
comparing ourselves and I feel like
that's one of the biggest things that
these sort of negative mindsets stem
from and the lack of self esteem and
self confidence comes from is when we
start comparing ourselves you could be
so happy and so excited and inspired by
something you're doing or creating and
then the minute you see someone else
doing something that in your head you
think is better instantly what you have
or what you've done
suddenly doesn't seem so great anymore a
day you realize that everybody's path in
life is different all of us are
completely different and unique in our
own ways especially as females we need
to stop comparing us
to one another and start cheering each
other on and feeling good about what
other people are doing because even if
you don't tell that person that you're
happy for them or you're inspired by
them it doesn't matter because it's all
about how it's all going down in your
own head so when you look at somebody
and you instantly feel jealous and mad
that you aren't as good as them not only
are you then sending up negative energy
to this person you're also creating some
sort of toxic turmoil in your head
that's making you feel like crap about
yourself we need to stop being so harsh
and mean to ourselves and we need to
start realizing that everything that
makes us us is unique and the mistakes
we made our lessons learn and the things
we don't have are things that we can
push and work for you can stop ourselves
dead in our tracks when it comes to
comparing our lives to other people but
to stop caring what other people think
is one of the hardest things we will
ever do and I don't think it's something
that you ever just completely turn off
I'm not going to tell you to never care
what anyone thinks because it's nearly
impossible but we have to learn to catch
ourselves doing it and to push ourselves
out of it faster if you go through your
entire life trying to be good enough for
everybody else you're never going to
feel good enough for yourself you're
going to get to the end of your life and
you're gonna be sitting there like oh my
god I spent my entire life trying to be
what I thought everybody else wanted me
to be because nobody's asking you
nobody's telling you you need to do this
it's all in your head you're happily
walking through life trying to do your
best to just live it as fully as
possible and be as content and do the
things that make you happy if that
bothers anybody else then that's their
problem and you shouldn't involve
yourself in that type of like negative
energy and just continue doing you and
we only have one short life on this
earth and my biggest fear is wasting
time when it comes down to it at the end
of the day all that matters is if you're
a good person and you live the good life
it's not an easy thing to do and you're
going to catch yourself caring every now
and then especially if you're doing
something you know out of your comfort
zone and out in public or in front of
people's eyeballs it makes you happy if
you want to do it just do it the faster
we start training ourselves to be ok
with that to be ok with us to you know
what do it because you want to not
because you feel you have to where you
feel you should or
other people think you should just do
what you want to be happy as long as
you're a good person at the end of the
day and you're not hurting anybody
the faster we push ourselves to live
boldly like that not only do we spend a
happier life with ourselves we also kind
of paved the path for other people to
see that and be like you know what good
for them good for that person for living
their life and not giving a I want
to do that so I hope you guys enjoyed
