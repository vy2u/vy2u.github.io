hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm going
to be doing a how to get inspired video
with you guys because it's been a while
since I filmed one of these it's kind of
like the mixture it's if we're taking a
coffee talk and a bit of a DIY and just
like you know mating them that was
really aggressive but you know what I'm
saying if you guys aren't following me
already be sure to check out my Twitter
and my Instagram again I forget what
side it's on I feel like it might be
this side that Lee's like I'm done with
this I don't want to be here
reason why I got inspired to film this
video is about like a month ago I was
feeling really uninspired and
unmotivated and I just didn't have it in
me to kind of come up with an excuse or
a reason to do a lot of the things that
I genuinely enjoy and love doing I felt
like that was really slacking on my
goals I felt like I was just kind of
sitting around and wasting time wasting
potential and just like feeling really
crummy about myself and it almost felt
like the longer I stayed in that sort of
mindset the harder it was taking me to
get out of it so the five ways that they
came up with that if you guys are going
through something similar you're feeling
unmotivated you're feeling uninspired or
anything of the sort then these are the
tips that are gonna help you kind of you
know motivate yourself
Rhian Spyer yourself and get excited
about life again because life is too way
too short to spend any second of it not
realizing that this is all freakin
miracle factor Persinger fact that
you're watching this the fact that i'm
existing the fact that your existing the
fact that we have like hats and books
and food and bagels and coffee summer
and fall and and everything in between
like it's all a freakin miracle and so
any time I spend wasting being sad and
uninspired and unmotivated it's mean to
take a video for granted these are gonna
be the tips that I keep from doing that
tip number one is connect with your
purpose and I know that we've kind of
talked about purpose and why before in
other coffe Docs and in other videos but
this is one of the most important things
that you can constantly do in your life
is reestablish like your why your
purpose your reason for the life you
want to live the things you want to be
doing and what you want to be
accomplishing when we feel unmotivated
or we feel uninspired by taking on the
action
the goals that we've set up for
ourselves it's usually because we've
lost the sense of touch with why we
started in the first place what it is
that made us want to do these things or
live this kind of life to begin with a
way to re-establish your Y or your
purpose is to start by asking yourself
what do you want from your life what
kind of life do you want to live what
kind of goals do you want to accomplish
what do you want to strive towards for
the future and get really clear about
this be super fit and healthy if you
want to be a successful photographer you
want to be a straight-a or like 4.0
whatever in university like whatever it
is establish what it is that you want
out of your life and then ask yourself
why do you want it because we can say
all the things we want but there's
always got to be a reason why like you
don't just want to be a successful
photographer the reason why you want to
be a successful photographer is because
you love the art of photography you love
being able to express yourself you like
to see your progress and how much better
you're getting along the way things like
that come up with a reason why and then
write it down if you haven't done this
before write it down on a piece of paper
write it down as many times as you need
to even if you can make it one words
like it could be happiness it could be
joy it could be to spread light like two
words even three words whatever but try
and make it as short as possible so that
even if you don't have it around you you
can reattach to your purpose right away
by just saying those two three one word
in your head for me mine is create my
purpose in life
I just love to create I love to create
things I love to share things so when I
feel unmotivated or I'm feeling an
inspired great before taking on a task I
tell myself like create share inspire
like those three words are kind of what
reattaches me to my purpose as to why I
do what I do having those words it's
like BAM in case you right back on that
target and right back into this is my
life purpose this these are the things
that I feel I was born to do or that I
just love to do and so it keeps you
reconnected and gets you inspired again
my second tip to getting it Rhian spired
Andry motivated is
change around your routines and your
habits now I did a whole video on how to
shake bad habits and get some new ones
which I'll pop somewhere up on the
screen
you guys can definitely go check that
out if you want to go dive right in deep
to the whole habit building and all of
that fun stuff but taking the light
version of that video I feel like when
it comes to feeling uninspired or
unmotivated we might be feeling just
like our life is just a little stale you
know we're waking at the same time every
day with the same view with the same
coffee with the same breakfast
with the same routine with the same
everything and then going to bed and
we're just feeling so like still
everything just feels like it's just
going through the motion when you change
up your habits and you change up your
routines it spices up your life again
like waking up at a different time in
the morning eating something new or
going to a different restaurant for
lunch or meeting up with an old friend
that you haven't seen in a while or
coming up with a new workout routine or
signing yourself up for a new workout
class even just taking it 20 minutes a
day to read a book instead of not taking
20 minutes a day to read a book tiny
little things like that changing up the
routine of your life and the routine
your every single day is going to
reinstall you and make you feel
motivated and shake things up so that
it's not the exact same thing every
single day there's an infinite amount of
you know combinations of the way that
you decide to do things you can wake up
and go for a run or you could wake up
and read your 15 minutes rate in the
morning with a cup of coffee like
there's so many different ways you can
spend your morning your night your
whatever even if your work has to stay
the same there's just so many different
ways that you can change up other things
so change of your teens and change of
your habits because that's going to get
you reinstated to start accomplishing
your goals and on that note tip number
three is to change up your environment
ie your bedroom your apartment your
house whatever it is a lot of times we
kind of overlook the fact that our
environment really dictates our energy
like if you are in a really dirty messy
unorganized unclean doesn't really play
off of like your personality atmosphere
then odds are you're gonna feel super
motivated super uninspired and just like
that this has always been a huge one for
me ever since I was a kid I would always
move around
job always paint my cliff I'm not
kidding you guys my childhood bedroom
probably had like this much just layers
of paint because of all the different
times I would paint my bedroom growing
up Haven still like you'll notice that I
never I never stopped changing around my
apartment I never stopped changing
around my furniture there's just so many
different ways that you can do little
things even adding a different throw
blanket and getting a new mug something
like that is a cheap treat that you can
give yourself but that little tiny
change in environment might make you
feel a little bit more cozy a little bit
more happy and just a little bit more
fun and inspired my life again I'd love
to do this with a change of seasons so
was it transitioning into fall I decided
to go out and just reduce up my
apartment with some new things and some
new decor pillows some new duvet covers
things like that and it just added a
little bit of touch and a little bit of
excitement to my apartment again and I
work from home so that's important for
me but even if you don't work from home
changing up your apartment is still
gonna make you feel really happy and
really inspired for life in general and
if you don't really have the money to do
that you can even just simply change
around your furniture you don't have to
buy anything new but just getting a
little bit new Fung Shui going on in
your room or function going on in your
apartment it's gonna give your entire
you know atmosphere a whole new feel to
it waking up and being like where the
heck like why am I facing this wall now
it just it adds a whole new perspective
and it makes it really easy to feel like
everything's fresh and brand-new again
tip number four is to make an inn spa
board and I know again we've talked
about dream boards before in the past
and there's so many different ways you
can do one I did one that was like a
Polaroid dream board and I'll link that
somewhere up on the screen as well that
you don't even have to make it a dream
board if you don't even know what your
dreams are you can easily just make it
an inspiration board you can just post
photos or post whatever like of things
that just make you feel happy and
excited about life like it could be
coffees it could be your favorite animal
it could be just like your favorite
cities all around the world it doesn't
necessarily have to be a dream board per
se it can just be an inspiration board
of images that just make you feel happy
and excited and that play off of your
personality and they play off your your
vibe and if you guys don't want to do
the DIY version of this you can just
simply recreate this on Pinterest or
create this on weak-hearted or tumblr
like come up with a tumblr page we hired
a page or a Pinterest page of all the
images that make you feel inspired and
then anytime you're not feeling it
anytime you're feeling a little low and
down and out you can just pop up your
phone open up your info board on
whatever platform you decided to make it
on and just scroll through it and it's
going to make you feel excited and
inspired again trust me
this works so much more than you'll ever
give it credit for we are very visual
creatures so when we see things it kind
of like triggers that little part in our
brain that's like inspired and motivated
and energetic again so when you see
things that inspire you or make you feel
happy or cozy you're gonna feel inspired
and happy and cozy and all of those
things you know what I'm saying
and then last but not least tip number
five is to write down your future life
I'm not saying write down what you want
your future life to be I'm saying write
down what your future life is going to
be it is detailed as possible and this
doesn't have to be set in stone but
right now if you were told that you
could have the exactly if you want it
write it down exactly what it would be
I'm gonna be wearing these clothes I'm
gonna have a clothing line I'm gonna
have a store open downtown Toronto I'm
going to be surrounded by family I'm
going to be surrounded by dogs and we're
going to be taking photos for a living
taking videos for a living I'm gonna be
a doctor I'm gonna be a lawyer whatever
it is like I'm gonna be married I'm
gonna be in love and I'm gonna be happy
I'm gonna be traveling I'm gonna be in
this city in this city
get as detailed about this as possible
don't say this is what I want say this
is what is going to happen the more
detail you put into this the better it's
going to work for you because you want
to write something that's literally
gonna knock your pants off you're so
freaking excited about it and writing it
down and having it on a physical piece
of paper is amazing because once you
have that again that's almost like a
bigger version of coming up with your
purpose but this is like okay I just
said this is gonna happen now let's go
out and make this happen and anytime
you're feeling like stale uninspired
unmotivated you can open it up and read
it again and if that doesn't resonate
with you anymore write a completely new
one and keep doing that in reading them
and fixing them and tweaking them and
doing this it's going to always
reestablish in your brain what you're
working towards not what you want to be
working towards what you are working
towards because I promise you if you
they're crazy enough to believe that you
can have all those things that you want
you're gonna have them there's someone
out there doing the things that you want
to do there's someone out there living
the life that you want to live there's
nothing stopping you from also being one
of those people the only thing that
tends to get in our way is us we start
to self-sabotage we start to feel
unmotivated or uninspired we stop kind
of giving ourselves the tools of the
necessities to go after the things we
want or we just think well I'm never
gonna get it anyway so why I feel
inspired and motivated why even try why
I put in the effort I put in the work
when this is the truth of my life and
I'm just going to accept it you don't
have to do that we have control over
what life we accept and I'm not saying
you should set an insane amount of
standards on yourself that you can't
reach I'm just saying don't set your
standard to a lower potential than you
deserve
no matter who you are watching this if
you're uninspired and you're unmotivated
and you're feeling down and out about
yourself odds are the feeling of being
down on yourself is what's keeping you
from getting inspired and motivated
again even if you don't end up
accomplishing all of the things that you
want to do even if you don't you know
end up being professional photographer
or the lawyer or the 4.0 student
just trying just going for it it's going
to still create the most amazing
memories in the most amazing life
you're gonna meet incredible people
you're going to fall in love with so
many different people and things and
you're going to live an insanely
incredible life but it's only going to
happen if you believe in yourself and
you push yourself out there and you know
you stay inspired by everything
constantly going on around you so now
climbing out of that deep hole we just
dug um that is it for today's video
those are my tips on how to get Rhian
spired and those are the tips that have
really worked for me since last month
too this month I've been getting so much
work done I've been so like you know
efficient and just going after things
because I'm feeling inspired again by
changing up you know even just the way I
do my makeup I wake up and I'm super
excited to do my makeup and then once my
makeups down I'm like wow now I gotta go
out and do things so that people can see
my face and I'm not saying I'm gonna do
my makeup like this all the time I'm
just saying that it's working for me now
and it's making me feel inspired these
are tips that are going to work I
promise you and if you guys have any
tips you
