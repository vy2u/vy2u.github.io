fulfilling the request to do a video all
about motivation and I feel like this is
just the perfect time for this video
for obvious reasons if you've watched my
last video I have kind of been in a
transitional period in terms of getting
back into like the groove of things in
terms of work and just everyday life and
moving into this apartment and such so I
figured it would be a perfect time to do
a video like this so if you find
yourself in any sort of given situation
where you kind of lost the motivation to
be the best you you could be or you know
that you have the potential to be doing
a lot better for yourself but for some
reason you just can't find that
motivation or the energy then this video
is going to be perfect for you it's just
little tips and tricks that I find helps
me it's going to get you to the places
that you want to be in life and yeah it
just makes you feel good you know and
you're just like I feel like yesterday
and today have been so productive for me
that I have just felt like such a boss
ass bitch and so I'm going to share my
tips with you guys so if you're looking
to get motivated in life and or just in
general or for fitness or anything like
that then just keep watching now I am
going to pop my headphones in and head
to the gym because this motivation thing
has to continue on into the night so one
of the biggest things that I find helps
pull me out of a rut and makes me feel
super motivated is getting up earlier in
the day and I know this probably won't
be a fan favorite but to be honest with
you I noticed that when I'm less
productive it's usually when I sleep in
more so setting an earlier alarm in the
day even if it's just an hour earlier is
gonna give you more time to get stuff
done or it just going to make you feel
better when you're up earlier you got
more of the day and all of that fun
stuff so set a few alarms and make the
labels on your alarm something that's
going to make you want to get out of bed
whether it be like a motivational quote
or something like that and then second
one of the biggest things that helps get
me motivated is music music affects my
mood so much lately I've been super into
like R&amp;amp;B because like I said before it
kind of makes me feel like a boss des
bitch but dancing around to R&amp;amp;B or any
type of upbeat music in the day and I
used Spotify which is really easy and
then speaking of music I also have been
getting back into working out
almost daily so you could do this from
home with like the kala Stein's BBG
which I also really like doing or yoga
at home which this has been huge for me
in terms of my stress levels and I've
been picking up yoga a lot since 2016
started but again you could also throw
on some running shoes and go running
outside you could go to a gym you could
do some of the workout videos from
YouTube but I know this is so over set
all the time but your physical health is
so important in terms of how motivated
you are and I find like the more I'm
taking care of my body by working out
and eating healthier it just makes me
feel better in terms of like a domino
effect and other aspects of my life so
then I kind of carry it into other
things and this doesn't just include
working out because that's only about 20
to 30 percent of your house it's also in
terms of eating healthier too so whether
you're vegan or not just eating a lot
less fried foods eating more Whole Foods
all things like that are going to play a
huge role in terms of how motivated you
feel in life and drinking tons of water
I've been cutting up Diet Pepsi which
I'm really proud of myself but I'm gonna
do a whole video on the fitness aspect
so don't worry about it there's gonna be
a whole video in terms of this free
weight and I might be alone on this one
but I'm somebody that I need my space to
be clean for my like head to feel clear
if that makes any sense at all so I feel
like cleaning my apartment just for five
seconds every single day just every
single room it just makes such a big
difference in terms of how clean the
whole apartment looks and then I feel
like I can get more stuff done so
keeping your space clean is super
important and then also getting things
like an agenda or day planner or a wall
calendar anything like that that's going
to help you plan out your days plan out
your goals so whatever your goals are
fill them into your day planner start
writing down what days you're going to
work out writing down what you're going
to eat those days or what you're going
to cook for dinner what days you need to
go get groceries so that you're not
eating out too much and things like
planning videos and then having a
journal you could use this as like
things to write down that you're
grateful for at the end of the day which
helps keeps me motivated or what your
goals are for the entire month or
anything like that anything that's going
to again help you stay on track of the
things that you want to be focusing on
in life and then last but not least I
also really like using audiobooks this
has been a big thing for healthy
stay motivated so I use my iPad for this
and I just downloaded a bunch of
audiobooks I'll leave some
recommendations down below but books
like you are a badass or just anything
like that that's just going to like help
you listen to it you can listen to it in
the car on long drives or while you're
working out and it just kind of gives
you a little bit of advice and
motivation that you might need okay and
this is one that might seem kind of you
know obvious but take yourself out make
plans with friends make plans family
just keep yourself busy give yourself um
like things to do and go out for a drink
or go for dinner go out for lunch dress
yourself up and take your cute ass out
the door and go out and do things this
has been so huge for me you know just
not staying in that like hermit mindset
where all I do is watch Netflix all
night just getting out and making plans
with people it actually just makes such
a difference especially if the people
that you're hanging around with are
people that are highly motivated and
doing things of life it makes such a big
difference on your mood and how
motivated you feel and then also another
thing I like to do is if you do spend a
lot of time at home try getting out like
even just to go to Starbucks or a little
cafe or somewhere I like to pack up my
laptop and my agenda and I'll go work on
like dreamcatcher or some videos or even
if you don't do anything online you
could just take your laptop and a book
and go read somewhere like Starbucks
where even though you might be alone
you're surrounded by other people that
are also kind of working on their own
things so it just makes you feel a
little bit less alone if that makes any
sense
and then my last and final tip is to
treat yourself every now and then
whether that be too like a dress you've
had your eye on for the summer or
anything like that like splurge on a
nice pair of headphones for the gym
anything that's gonna keep you motivated
anything that you can buy that's going
to kind of you know make you feel like
you want to go to the gym or make you
feel like you want to get out and go out
and do things so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video that is all I have for you

missed any tips and I will see you guys
