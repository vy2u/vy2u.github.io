in a minute hey guys and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm filming
in my brand new apartment for the very
first time this setup is temporary we're
working with it but with that said I am
so so excited I'm loving my new
apartments you guys can see when moving
blog I'll pop it down below or somewhere
up on the screen so you guys can go
ahead and watch it but for today's video
I'm with Ewing and coffee talk style
videos you guys I tweeted you guys
asking what coffee talk topics you guys
want to see so I'm going to open it up
and go through some of them we're not
going to make this just like one solid
coffee talk topic I'm just going to kind
of roll through it sort of like a Q&amp;amp;A
but more so like a I don't even know
something to make you guys ask questions
you guys just wanted me to talk about
certain topics so we're just talking
about them grab your coffee your tea
your hot chocolate
you know your memory to whatever it is
you're drinking and let's do this so
Ellen wanted me to talk about how to
stay organized and how to be more
productive this year
Joy's been doing a whole series on my
channel for the month of January sort of
leading into February where I kind of
want to make each month this year sort
of have a theme to it in terms of videos
so for January I'm going to be doing a
ton of videos with like organization
motivation like kind of getting your
life on track getting like goals all
that fun stuff a few things that I have
recently picked up that have really
helped me in terms of getting organized
and things like that one was a brand new
file folder that my brother actually got
me for Christmas I've been using that in
every single time there's a piece of
paper or receipt or something that I
know I can't lose normally I'm like I'm
too lazy to go put this in my file
folder let's throw it off to the sides
and we're already done with it
so I'm making a conscious effort to just
get up and go put it away exactly where
I needed to and that fun even just in
terms of important papers like
everything if you just want people more
organized instead of doing like the
laziest version of everything
I'm just going to hide this behind there
or like I'm going to put this away later
I find lately I've just been forcing
myself to get up and put away where it
actually is supposed to be it in the
right place and it's helping me stay
more organized you know that they have
really been helping me stay organized
recently is I started using the notes
section on my cell phone and what I'll
do is I make my daily to-do lists on
there and the nice thing about that is
it syncs up with my laptop so every time
I'm working I can pull up my notes on
there and see what I have left to do and
they have an option on the iPhone to
like check it off once it's done so I've
been really using that especially in
terms of moving I have all my routines
on my notes I have my grocery list my
to-do lists for at least the next like
three to four days for those of you guys
that maybe not don't like to use
planners this is super helpful or you
can combine it with your planner like I
did but I was moving it didn't have my
Snyder on me all the time so using my
notes as like a check off to-do list and
I have like lists of things to do in
terms of moving or lists for things to
do in terms of like upcoming trips and
stuff like that and each note is
separate it's just so nicely organized
on my phone there's no paper so I highly
recommend trying out some notes on your
iPhone I only recently like to spin
there but I always just overlook saying
okay so Megan wants to know can be
stressing tips during a stressful point
in your life or little things that help
you get through up that day I feel like
in terms of getting through a bad day I
like to have certain little things that
I do specifically for bad days and I'll
know will make me feel better
for instance I'm really trying to budget
and save money right now and just be
more like adult and wise immature when
it comes to money myself I Starbucks I
stopped
like or in food and things like that and
not that it's necessarily a good thing
to reward yourself with food but when
I'm really having a bad day like
everything's falling apart on me or
something really bad has happened or I
just feel really low and down I'll
either give myself a little treat of
going out and grabbing the Starbucks
because I don't do that anymore or
ordering myself some food and putting on
my favorite TV show when I say those
things we're just when I'm having a bad
day it's like a little treat instead of
doing it all the time others
you can do when you're having a bad day
is let's draw yourself a bubble bath and
again bring your laptop in it and like
set it up on your like the top of your
toilet and like walk your favorite show
in the bubble bath and don't let anybody
bother you the other really awesome tip
you could do to is have a little jar and
every time you have extra change or
extra bills every now and then just
throw it into this jar and bake it for
like you know people do that for a rainy
day you could do this for a bad day so
that if you know you're having chromium
save the world
grab your jar take all the money out and
go get yourself something nice whether
it be the food the star get some
organized work on top or a new lipstick
and new foundation something is just
gonna lift your fears up when I've no
overwhelmed that is definitely one I am
the most stress so how I keep from
getting there is making sure that I
write down every single thing that I
need to remember and that is again I
know I've talked about this already
but last more my notes on my song comes
in super handy because any times at
least tops in my head my phone is always
on me and I'll just write into my to-do
list whether it be my something I need
to do that day the next day or the next
day or something that you need to do by
the end of the month I also have a note
that's like January to do February to do
and you can add it into one of those
Pali read it says I'd love to hear your
thoughts on balance and stress you know
work like YouTube friends spinning all
the plates in terms of balance if I'm
being honest most of you guys sometimes
my life is not near as balanced as it
should be but I'm also really lucky in
the sense that my work life is also my
passion and my hobbies but because of
that I've had to get so zoned in on
videos and writing and you know like all
the little tiny things I'm trying to do
that I do definitely get off balance one
thing I like to do is always plan for
one specific thing each week whether it
be seeing a friend going out like for
dinner to a movie or something like that
that keeps my social life you know in
check it keeps me from being a loner for
the rest of my life having a certain
time of the day where I decide no more
work is going to be done after that it
keeps me from overwhelming myself and
filling my plate too much the things
that will get done and in turn
of like health and fitness I always make
this my top priority because if you
don't take care of yourself there's no
way you're going to have the time or the
energy of a metal like clarity to be
able to deal or balance anything else so
number one for me is always my health
and my being fit because like getting my
workout in and making sure I'm eating
healthy relatively most of the time it
makes it so much easier for me to
balance all the rest like friends and
work and writing and just day-to-day
living it's kind of schedule certain
days like Fridays try and make plans
with people so that you know you don't
socialize Sunday's make that your
cleaning day where you get all your
chores done make sure that your sewing
work after 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. make sure
you're getting your time and for your
own mental clarity and your mental
health and having like those set-aside
days or specific times it's going to
make balancing so much easier h / @ NE
want to know how to fight laziness okay
this is going to sound so simple I used
to sit around and be like but I can't
find the motivation I have to wait guys
motivation to do the action my reason I
finished reading actually like two days
ago this book called excuse my language
but the subtle art of not giving a sauce
and it is such a good book you guys need
to read it so something he talked about
in there we're in a chapter he goes into
all of these people that wrote into him
for help being like how do I do this how
do I go out and find a friend
how do I go up to some of the icons how
do all these people have the time to
work out every day how do I find the
motivation to do this and he put it so
simply that it kind of hit me like a
brick wall he was like there is no how
you just do it I think we sit back and
try and figure out how to do it right or
what's the best way to do this or I'm
waiting for the motivation to find that
the inspiration to do it when a lot of
the times if we just do it we'll figure
it out either it will work and we'll get
it done right away like if it's fighting
laziness to get off the couch and go
work out it's not even how do I fight
the laziness it's just you just have to
do it you have to get up and go work out
and stop thinking about it do it like
it's that simple I just shine above to
set it so well just do
yesterday you said tomorrow no what are
you waiting for
threw away you just have to do it even
if you're not exactly sure what it is
you should be doing nobody knows what we
should be doing it you just sit around
and wait for this motivation to take
your butt off the couch or kick your
butt out of bed it's just not going to
happen action leads to motivation which
leads to inspiration which leads to more
action it all starts with action I know
it's that simple it really is but I am
my own self out of those and last but
not least the final topic we're going to
go into is from Jillian she wants to
know your future goals dreams places you
want to visit and your bucket list and
okay the second shall we so my future
goals right now I cannot make myself too
far future goals because I think that
lies can constantly detour and it should
constantly detour but in terms of my
future goals for this year I really want
to get trained catcher published and I
really want to travel a lot this year
and I know that's kind of a broad ideas
just travel a lot but whatever there's
the opportunity to travel I want to say
yes for instance I really want to go to
Iceland and see the Northern Lights a
lot share focus I've done this year but
I definitely want to get it done the
next year or two some other places I'd
really love to travel our Australia New
Zealand basically anywhere I'm so open
to travel and absolutely anywhere and
then in terms of my bucket list
some really important things I bucket
list I've seen the Northern Lights
skydiving I really want to go skydiving
facing my fears of massive bodies of
water
ie oceans and lakes by forcing myself to
scuba dive like my chest is tightening
and thinking of that but there's so many
things that like I want to do I want to
I want to go color run there's like you
can walk the edge of the CN Tower here
in Toronto and it's something like it's
like a little peep out of listing but it
could be really fun so I want to do that
this year and I really want to learn a
new language which I'm actually in the
process of doing
I'm officially 3% fluent in French
basically I want to do it all there's
not much on this earth that I wouldn't
want to try if you guys have any
you know bucket list things places to
travel or future goals please leave them
down below because I'm curious to know
what you guys are up to what you guys
are spending your time doing and I am
going to end this coffee talk here
