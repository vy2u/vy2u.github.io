supposed to way I think about your
nightly oh can you tell
hey guys so for today's video I am I
kind of came up with this idea earlier
this week but long story short if you
guys have been watching my vlogs or just
like keeping up with my tumblr or my
website you'll know that like I recently
fell into a rut but - the kind of good
thing that came from it is I came up
with this video idea that I am
officially doing for you guys today and
it's just like simple and easy ways or
just just ways in general to pull
yourself out of like ruts or times in
life where you're just feeling really
low or nothing seems to be going right
or you have a like zero lack of
motivation or whatever it is that just
to clarify I am in no way shape or form
like a professional when it comes to
anything like depression so if it is
something you're suffering from and you
haven't seeked help yet I really do have
to recommend that you do that to reach
up to somebody reach out to your doctor
or anything but for those of you that
might just be watching let's just are
going through a bit of a write or maybe
you battle with sometimes both sometimes
I do too regardless if you guys are in
this type of situation at all I really
really really want to reiterate to get
help if you need to there's nothing
wrong with it there's nothing
embarrassing about getting help and just
either talking to a therapist or getting
on medication whatever it is you have to
do do it take care of yourselves and
yeah if there's anything that you think
I may have missed or something that has
helped you come out of one of these
phases just go ahead and leave a comment
down below so that what we're watching
this or just all of us can just read
through and just give each other advice
and all of that fun stuff also do you
guys remember when I tweeted changes in
the hair
I finally got my changes in the hair
literally play into this hair in the
summertime like I said to Maggie it was
like Maggie come the fall I'm getting
new extensions and I am putting them as
Navy tips and we just like dyed the tips
navy blue and I'm obsessed I'm so
obsessed other than that if you guys
want to see the tips and tricks I use to
kind of pull myself out of the ruts of
life then just keep watching
so I'm sure we've all been in one of
those phases where you just want to bury
yourself under blankets and pillows or
you're looking for answers for why
you're feeling so low and unmotivated so
that is the video I'm going to be doing
for you guys today one of the biggest
things I found that can help me pull
myself out of ruts and such is
meditation so I know I've talked about
it with you guys before but I'll leave
links to some like really positive music
down below and it's stuff that's
supposed to kind of like encourage like
positive energy from your brain and just
just the music itself can kind of omit
that so I do try and meditate a lot more
now and just do yoga if meditation isn't
so much your thing or if meditation and
yoga aren't really so much your thing
you could also try journaling and I just
find journaling can help get your
thoughts out onto paper so that they're
not so stuck in your head and also I
find just getting a new feel or a new
vibe from a room that you spend the most
time in can help too so I always like to
rearrange or repaint or redecorate when
I'm kind of feeling low because it just
gives you know new Fung Shui and new
energy from your room so it's so easy to
do and just flipping it all around can
really give you new perspective and just
a new feel
and I know when you're feeling low it
can be so easy to just pick out on junk
food to make yourself feel better but
you should be more aware of the foods
that you're putting into your body to
fuel your brain as well as just finding
a form of exercise that you find helps
like I find running very therapeutic I
love running but it could be any form of
exercise anything that's going to help
it get off your mind or just make you
feel better
and something like running releases
happy endorphins so you can't complain
about that and another thing is I
actually got the chance to try out a
TomTom watch if you guys don't already
know that from when I was in Spain and I
loved it just for the fact that it kind
of tracks my sleep I can track how many
steps I take a day it's so awesome so
just taking care of your overall health
and tracking how healthy you've been can
really help improve your state of mind
you may also want to ask why you feel
low or depressant if it's because you
have unrealistic or bad goals or you're
holding yourself up to expectations that
aren't very healthy for you then maybe
you need to request an what you consider
to be goals so I don't necessarily
consider goals the amount of things you
have or the way you look
I'd rather dream bigger and you know
have my goals be being a good person or
working towards something that makes me
feel inspired so really question what
you're holding yourself accountable to
and what you are considering to be goals
and I am doing quotation marks around
goals right now and another really good
thing is to try and simplify your life
and a way of doing this is just grab a
piece of paper and write down the five
most important things the highest
priorities in your life clean out your
closet get rid of things around your
house that you don't need and also
reduce the amount of time that you're
spending on social media we're so
consumed and we spend so much time with
so many different things going on so you
should try and limit the time that
you're spending you know looking at all
these things and talking to all these
people and just put the phone away at
some times and just hang up by yourself
or hang out with your friends
face-to-face
and also one of the biggest things that
I have found can contribute to my
anxiety and depression is how much sleep
I'm getting and how much quality sleep
I'm getting so again I use my watch to
track my sleep but also just in general
getting better sleep it's been crazy how
much that affects my mood as well as
just getting a hobby or really getting
into a book something that can kind of
take your mind off things or whether
you're creating or just getting really
into the characters or relating or just
kind of getting away from life sometimes
so pick a good book and just start
reading it and sitting down and getting
excited about it or better yet pick a
book that kind of inspires you so I'll
leave some of my favorites down below
but maybe ones that kind of promote
overall wellness and just taking care of
your brain and taking care of yourself
and I know I mentioned limiting time on
social media and on your phone but
sometimes I find it can help just going
on tumblr and relating with people that
might feel the same way are writing out
a long time blur post or just watching
people's videos who I find inspire me
just doing things like that it can
really help sometimes to gain the
inspiration that you might just be
looking for so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video of just some ways that I have
found can help pull me out of the ruts
or the low parts of life if you're
watching this and you're not feeling so
great I hope you guys do feel better
life is too short to spend it unhappy
and cue the sappy girl from Mean Girls
who doesn't even go here other than that
I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys on my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
