better
hi hey your bone in your mouth so I'm
undecided of whether or not I like this
foaming area I feel like we need to
adjust just like a tiny bit I'm trying
to get a happy median between being
comfy but also things looking kind of
cute
you know that's kind of good news
nestling on here it's a freaking
freaking wide okay here just just like
open pages and it's just like writing
itself and I'm letting it happen that's
it that's all hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm doing a coffee talk with you
guys partly because a lot of you guys
were worried about with my coffee talk
podcasts coming out that I was gonna do
coffee talk videos anymore so I'm
settling all your fears and doing the
video at the same time coffee talks
there's still gonna be a thing on my
channel it's just gonna be more coffee
talks like abundantly in my life now
because they're gonna be both on
podcasts every single Monday and they're
still gonna be dabbling here and I own
my channel so no need to stress no need
to worry coffee talks are here to stay
and today I'm here with my namaste
namaste in bad mug because to be honest
with you it was very hard to not namaste
in bed this morning
also I'm filming in my bedroom so excuse
the fluctuating lighting but I like to
use mother nature as my filming gear
because hey I'm lazy Abby I like the
natural light so the lighting throughout
this video is just gonna fluctuate but
that's okay because as does life
fluctuate getting all metaphoric before
the videos even be done so for today's
video I wanted to talk about change and
whether it be you know good change bad
change change in our life that we
ourselves create and change in our life
that we don't really have much control
over change in our life that maybe
catches us off guard or kind of inserts
itself into our life without our real
wanting of that change or
acknowledgement of that change lately
and just in general for the next little
bit my life has been and will be
changing a lot there has been a lot
going on even just in the last like
couple of weeks with traveling so much
and with starting up this podcast now
which I didn't
mentioned I will link it down below if
you guys want to check out a coffee talk
podcasts even just taking that on as a
new project and taking on traveling and
in general a lot of things in my life
have been changing lately and one of
them is one that I've noticed a lot of
you guys have started to ask comments
about and it's one that I knew I wanted
to address but I wanted to do it the
right way and it is whether or not Greg
and I are still together and so that is
another change that has happened in my
life unfortunately it Gregg and I are no
longer together but we'll get to that
story in a second I'll explain
everything so hold tight fret not it's
kind of a bittersweet story like a happy
sad story if that makes any sense but
all in all in my life my life is
changing a lot right now and it's weird
because I'm somebody that I actually do
really enjoy change and I think that
change is always a good chance to
reinvent ourselves and try new things
and kind of grow but it is also first
people that maybe get anxious very
easily or people that get overwhelmed
really easily sometimes change can also
feel very scary and very daunting and
with all of the change going on in my
life I felt kind of inspired to write
out even just for myself how to kind of
get through change and then turn it into
this coffee talk so that any of you guys
watching might pick a piece of knowledge
from this and use it in your own life to
feel a little better about the changes
going on there - I'm gonna go through
four full steps that I think are super
important for embracing change and
dealing with change and kind of making
change your bitch rather than letting it
kind of consume you and drag you down
and make you feel scared and weary and
anxious and hopefully we'll all make it
through the other side feeling great
feeling like a new person and excited
for the good things that come even with
that change we'll start with the
break-up since I know that's probably
the biggest question you guys have this
breakup is a really like different type
of breakup for me because I've never had
this kind of breakup before I guess
where it's literally genuinely two
people that love each other very very
much but I think as you guys have maybe
even noticed some videos and it's -
neither of our faults our lives just
became so busy and so consumed by the
things we were trying to do and
accomplished and unfortunately they
weren't naturally meshing they weren't
naturally overlapping and so it caused a
lot of friction and it caused a lot of
time apart between the two of us we have
such a deep
deep love for each other and we parted
so amicably and so maturely and with so
much love and respect for each other
they're both kind of wanting to be in
separate places but also together at the
same time and neither of us can be two
places at once and so it started to kind
of create a bit of friction and
resentment towards each other that we
both agreed we wanted to kind of call an
end to now so that we can walk away
still having that love and that respect
for each other rather than let it get to
a point that we kind of taint our entire
relationship with resentment because
we're fighting so much which is taking
away all the time that we could have
used to kind of love each other if that
makes sense and so we both just agreed
that our timing is awful our timing is
terrible
the things we want aren't aligning and
what I want and what he wants and me
wanting him to have what he wants and
him wanting me to have what I want
but those wants not being the same thing
I hope this is making sense I don't know
this is still very fresh so bear in mind
but it's for that reason my life is
about to change and my life is changing
and my life has been changing and for
that reason I've written up some good
old tips to get through that change and
get through any kind of hardship or
transition in your life and if you want
to hear said tips then just keep
watching
absolutely the longest intro ever number
one is to find the faith no matter what
you choose to believe in for me I like
to believe that everything happens for a
reason and even when you try and think
of things that could have gone
differently things that you could have
done differently things that would have
created a different result for you I
think that that's just kind of eluding
our thoughts and playing a trick on
ourselves like a really mean trick on
ourselves to believe that anything could
be different than what is already
presently happening and so when you have
that belief that everything happens for
a reason it gives you that strength of
faith to think that you know what this
sucks this is really sad or like this is
really hard to kind of go through but
maybe there's a reason that it's
happening this all had to have happened
for reasons all had to have had some
sort of significance or been some sort
of stepping stone to something that I
don't even see coming yet and so with
that you make yourself feel even just an
inch better about it or help yourself to
accept
the change rather than wonder how you
could have made it have any other sort
of outcome I think when you have faith
in yourself and your faith in your life
and your timing even when change comes
around that you don't want to fully open
yourself up to or welcomed with open
arms per se you still let it happen
knowing that there's a reason that it
has to be happening and that with that
faith that you feel that you'll make it
through and that faith that you feel
that there's a reason that this is
stepping you to something possibly
better or something different or
something that you need to do or a place
you need to go then
even though the change is hard and even
though the transition is bittersweet you
kind of have an understanding or you
kind of have that bit of backbone to
help you push through it and get to the
other side of that change so that you
can see what's coming next
number two is to find the humor and
sounds contradictive because I feel like
when we're talking about when it's bad
change or when it's hard change or her
transitions or kind of crappy things
going on in our life it's not always the
easiest thing to do to find some humor
in that because how do you laugh when
you're going through a breakup how do
you laugh when your childhood house is
being sold or how do you laugh when your
parents are getting divorced or how do
you laugh when someone you care about is
kind of struggling or how do you laugh
when you lose somebody or they pass away
how do you laugh when things aren't
going the way you want but ultimately
you almost kind of just have to you have
to find the humor and you have to suck
all of that heaviness off of it and find
that little piece of humor in the fact
that life is all about balance there has
to be a bit of suffering for us to work
through to then find that light and to
kind of build ourselves to a greater
standpoint and a greater presence on
earth that was very preachy but I feel
like I feel like I'm speaking from a
soul so just let me keep flowing
for instance I'm just gonna keep rolling
off of this story because it's obviously
the biggest change going on in my life
right now but even when Greg and I were
going through and talking about
everything and talking it all out and
kind of coming to terms with the fact
that we were obviously going to have to
split we were still laughing and kind of
trying to find a little bit of humor and
the good times we had and the funny
things about why we weren't working and
how stubborn we both are and things
like that which just took a lot of the
heaviness off and it helps to give you a
new perspective and it helps to make
things not feel so heavy and so serious
all the time and it just kind of helps
you balance those emotions it helps you
balance out how heavy you feel with just
a little bit of lightness that can bring
your equilibrium to a little bit more of
an attainable spot to help you kind of
coast through this transition that
you're going through you can still be
sad and you can still feel all of the
feelings that come with hard change and
find a little piece of humor in all of
it it doesn't mean that you have to just
laugh and ignore your feelings or ignore
the emotions that come with it it just
means that through that sadness try and
lighten the mood every now and then and
find a little bit of humor in it if for
nothing than just to lighten the load on
like your chest and your heart and and
your mind for a few seconds and just
kind of laugh it off a little and shake
shake up your bones and just get get
different changes and shifts of energy
coming through you even if it only lasts
a millisecond number three is one that
I've spoken up before but it's to focus
on solutions instead of focusing on the
problems and I say this one because it
has been a huge mantra or affirmation
for myself lately that's really pulled
me through a lot of difficult obstacles
that I've been facing I find when I tend
to dwell on my problems I turn into a
bit of a victim mentality and I start to
feel bad for myself and I start to feel
sad and then like I said you want a
namaste in bed because you're just so
focused on all of the things going wrong
that you don't even have any sort of
clarification of how things could
potentially go right or how things are
still going right in other areas of your
life or how there's always something you
can do about the problems that we face
even if it's something that's completely
different from the problem that's going
on for instance with going through a
breakup and I'm using that again as an
example because it's the freshest change
in my life but was going through a
breakup I could focus on that lack of
someone being there I could focus on how
much I miss that person or I can take
that energy and kind of channel it into
creating something trying something new
or starting up a new hobby or using that
force or that feeling or that emotion
because emotions like that during
especially hard change are so strong
that it can give you such breakthroughs
in other areas of your life if you can
take it
channel it somewhere else so focus on
finding a solution rather than focusing
on how sad you feel about your problems
it helps you feel more level-headed and
it helps you look at things a little bit
more honestly and it helps you kind of
have your own back through things
instead of feeling like you're waiting
for somebody to come along and make you
feel better or waiting for your problems
to just kind of disappear it gives it
puts you back in the driver's seat and
it gives you the chance to make
something out of the lemons that are
being handed to you and above all at the
end of the day it gives you a sense of
hope to kind of hold on to as well
because when you focus on a solution
even working towards that solution even
thinking about that solution even
brainstorming possible solutions is like
the little glimmer of hope and another
wise kind of hard or heavy or sad
situation tip number four is to face
your fears now I read a quote today I
actually tweeted it for those of you
guys that have me on Twitter I read a
quote this morning that said the fears
we don't face become our limits and it
shook with me to my core because I
realized how true that statement is when
there's something you're afraid of and
you hide from it it becomes a limit it
becomes something that guards a door to
the other side of your fear Wow that was
super deep I didn't even know where that
one came from either guys this is like
see what I mean hard change brings up a
lot of like heavy emotion breakthroughs
it's true though I guess you could look
at your fear kind of like a demon or a
monster or a dragon whatever is least
scary to you guarding a door and that
door is one that you need to walk
through but when you hide away from your
fears and you don't face them then you
can't get to the other side of them and
when you do face them you realize that
we can't let our fears shrink us we
can't let our fears confine what we
consider our safe place or our safe
haven because then we're asking
ourselves to fall into these really dark
and heavy places that become very
difficult for us to get out of and that
can be the dark and heavy place of a
victim mentality that could be the dark
and heavy place of depression that can
be the dark and heavy place of not
wanting to get out of your bed or not
wanting to face the problems or the
obstacles in your life or not wanting to
grow past the things that were not
willing to accept yet and so when we
kind of accept that those are our fears
and then we face them we take away all
their power and with facing our fears
and with
accepting our fears we surrender our
belief of having any kind of control
over what happens in our life and we
kind of let our path reveal itself and
instead we walk along it and we make the
best of every high and we learn what we
can from every low so that we're
constantly growing as we take each step
forward and we stop letting our fears
haunt us along the way and we stop
letting the things that were scared of
whether it's being alone or whether it's
missing somebody or whether it's moving
somewhere new or being outside of your
comfort zone or having to push yourself
for something that you maybe didn't
think you were ready for and so when we
face those fears and when we're honest
with ourselves and we're just doing the
best we can every step of the way and
trying to kind of make the most of the
lemons hand to us I think it we did
something once that was like when life
hands you lemons ditch them and grab a
latte so when you take those lemons and
you toss them in the trash and you grab
yourself a latte and you get all hyped
up you know focus your mind on the next
project those fears stop becoming limits
and that faith is easier to hold on to
and the humor kind of seeps its way into
your mind and you find yourself laughing
when you thought that you were just
devastated and you find solutions
popping through where you want to only
solve problems and suddenly you're on
the other side of that door and you've
made it through and you look back on
what you're learning right now in this
moment and you understand then what
you're only learning right now and
that's all you can do that's all we can
ever do that's all any of us can do so I
can do in this situation it's all you
can do in this situation it's all as
human beings when we go through anything
it's all you knew there's no way to
think yourself through it there's no way
to make them disappear you just got to
take it day by day you got to take it
step by step
and you just gotta trust yourself and
believe that there has to be a reason
that's happening and learn from it and
move forward knowing that odds are
you're probably gonna face a few more
obstacles but each time you do get that
much better at getting over to the other
side of the obstacles and seeing what
flowers wait for us on set side I bought
myself flowers today that's why I said
that right now I'm hoping for some
lilacs and gerber daisies and I would
even take a couple four-leaf clovers
maybe I should buy a lottery ticket so
there you have it that was my coffee
talk today unchanged I hope that I was
able to take the whale it's kind of
feeling inside and put it into words
well enough that were easy to follow and
also I
that this gives you just a little bit of
insight as to why I've been a little all
over the place lately
sometimes I'm answering comments
sometimes I drop off the face of the
earth for a day or two I'm just trying
to try to figure it out you know find a
little bit a little bit of gratitude for
something that I am really happy for
like Bentley or you guys or being able
to create being able to take that
feeling or take that hardship in my life
and be sitting here and creating a video
about it it makes it a lot easier for me
to just like ease away that overwhelm
and trust that there has to be a reason
all of these things happen there has to
be a reason there has to be some sort of
balance in life and no matter what your
path I think if you have good intentions
and you go at things with a good mindset
and you just try and be a good person
along the way you'll end up somewhere
good no matter what so you just got to
have that faith and that trust and just
keep walking and get those pedometers
steps in it you know if you guys are
going through any kind of change and you
want to talk about it I feel like our
community is so loving and like
nourishing and we all give such great
advice even your guys's feedbacks on
these videos give so many more
perspectives that I didn't even go
through yet so be sure to pop those down
below and we can create a very loving
and happy space to talk about all the
weird and odd change and how chaotic and
crazy life can feel sometimes because
everybody's got crap going on
everybody's got something something to
deal with or something to work through
and aside from that I'm doing well
considering and handling all this energy

fun so I mean that's about that's about
