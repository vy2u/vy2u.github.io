to my channel for today's video I'm
doing another vlog with you guys as I'm
sure you already know since it is Sunday
I've had a lot of coffee today which is
probably why I'm rambling a little bit
too fast for today's video I wanted to
do a vlog doing a life makeover or just
kind of sprucing up your life because
one I am somebody that celebrates things
way too early and because I've been just
like so inspired to clean my apartment
and organize everything and just kind of
get a jumpstart on spring cleaning even
though like as I look outside right now
I just see layers and layers of snow but
also just because in general I feel like
it's good every now and then to be
changing things up keeping things fresh
in order to kind of stay motivated and
inspired even just to keep your mind
fresh I always might want to change
around my apartment always been wanting
to change around my decor I've always
been want to change around like my
routines I just feel like when I don't
when I do the exact same thing all the
time and I keep things the exact same
way I just feel like so what's the word
and unstimulated like I just feel I feel
like my brain just ends up in these
modes where like you drive places and
you don't even remember getting from
point A to B or like I don't know I just
start feeling like oh so in the spirit
of that and the mixture of the fact that
I've just been feeling really inspired
and drawn to literally gut clean and
just change things up and reorganize it
brought this video really quick if you
guys aren't following me already be sure
to check out my Twitter in my Instagram
I always kind of post little hints at
what videos are gonna be beforehand so
if you guys want to keep on top of that
then definitely go check that out and
also I posted a new blog post on Friday
it was always my favorite bootable
recipes plus just in general how to make
a bootable not gonna lie guys I've been
getting so into like my blog it's been
such a nerdy thing for me like I had way
too much fun making bootable this week
but rolling back let's get back on point
if you guys want to do a little mini
life makeover or watch me do a little
mini life makeover then just keep
watching I'm also gonna list everything
that I'm doing down below more point
forms so that it's easier to follow but
anyway that's besides the point
so now that I've got the vibe going on
in the apartment lit up the neon lights
we got the infuser going thank you guys
so much by the way for those of you guys
that were commenting to be careful with
certain essential oils because of
Bentley I literally had no idea so I
printed off a huge list to make sure
that all the essential oils that I use
are totally okay for Bentley and I
recently bought a bunch of incense for
like all the different chakras and I've
been wanting to burn them but I'm afraid
that they might not be good for dogs so
I need to do more research on that but
in the meantime I've been using my
infuser so much I'm so obsessed with it
right now okay
anyway let's get to the important part
so the first section I have written down
when it comes to giving your life a
makeover is mental we always have to
work on our mental state before we can
work on anything else because once it's
kind of like the root to all problems
you can change all of the surface level
things you want but if you don't kind of
work inwardly and change what's going on
inside your mind and what's going on
inside of like who you are and the way
you think about things then I think it's
gonna be really hard to ever kind of
find a new sense of joy or spark that
little bit of inspiration I don't think
that you can ever do too much work on
like your mental state I think we're
constantly growing and I think we're
constantly learning new things and we
should always kind of stay that way it's
always a good starting point when it
comes to giving your life either a mini
makeover or feeling like you're trying
to just completely clear off your slate
and start new obviously I've done a ton
of videos already when it comes to books
to read I feel like that is usually how
I kind of exercise the mental state when
I was growing up I was always a reader
but I loved fiction and I never thought
I would be a nonfiction person I think
the first non-fiction book that I
actually ever really got into was The
Four Agreements and you are a badass
just hooked me into this whole spiritual
kind of self-discovery self journey even
if you don't think you need self-help
it's always good to kind of read those
books because they give you such fresh
and new perspectives on life I've talked
about The Four Agreements
and I've talked about you are a badass I
feel like so many times so I tried so
hard not to make those the books that I
talked about in this video but what I am
going to talk to you guys about are the
two books that were most recently on my
2018 reading list for inspirational and
motivational books which I will leave
that video down below this one light is
the new black this one's very spiritual
but I also
like that she simplifies a lot of the
things that could be considered kind of
like spiritual practice for instance
like having dance parties she talks
about having dance parties in here and
if you guys watch my wandering routine
you'll know that I love dance parties I
used to have dance parties with my old
roommate Maggie it was just like such a
feel-good thing especially if you're in
a bad mood you just kind of switch your
mental state over just a lot of
meditation and spiritual things in that
sense the one that I'm reading right now
is sacred powers by David G and this one
when I first started reading it I
honestly I got goose bumps
those two are two that would recommend
if you're looking for motivation if
you're looking for a bit more like
internal inspiration some other ways
that you can make over your mental state
or kind of just freshen up the
connection that you're feeling within
your mind or your thoughts or meditation
it's something that I started
implementing very like not I wouldn't
say strictly I just started making it
more of an ingrained habit in my life
and it has made such a drastic change if
it's something that you don't already do
and you're watching this video with the
inspiration of making over your life I
can't stress enough to find a way to
implement meditation into your life you
don't have to do like the sit down Zen
kind of meditation sometimes I'll
meditate when I'm driving sometimes I
meditate when I'm doing like my hair and
makeup I'll listen to a guided
meditation 90% of the time I do my
meditations after my yoga and I just
kind of sit you know sometimes
cross-legged sometimes I lay down but
like the thing is is that if you're
going at something with the intention of
kind of clearing your mind and just
feeling at peace within yourself to me
that's meditation and I think playing
around with meditation and finding
different ways to do it is a good thing
I don't think you should structure
yourself to one solid way to some people
it might not even be meditation it could
be art it could be drawing it could be
writing but just implementing some sort
of hobby or habit into your life that
kind of creates that and that synergy
within like your mind your body and your
spirit I don't know if any of you guys
have noticed but to me my life has been
feeling very different than it was even
just a few months ago and I think that
it's honestly because of in a way I've
been doing this little mini makeover but
over the series of the last I'd say two
to three months I feel like I'm going
through some sort of transformation
right now and I'm digging it but I don't
think that any of it would be happening
if I didn't start with my mental state
you know like changing my core beliefs
and changing
my core habits in order to start making
some room or creating some space for new
things to come in that might better my
life and not judging them or thinking
that maybe that they don't connect with
my life for whatever reason but just
letting things kind of happen and
showing up every day to make those
things happen in order to see if they
make any sort of change if you start
with like your mental state and see
anything that you can shift or change
there then everything else will just
kind of have like a domino effect okay I
feel like I've grabbed it long enough
let's roll in to Phase two of this life
makeover here we go look at your little
mini makeover the real Slim Shady please
stand up so the second category in terms
of giving yourself or your life a little
mini makeover is physical lately I've
been feeling a little bit more impulsive
than usual and wanting to just like do
so many things because I think it's
honestly the wind down to my birthday I
don't know I don't know I just I felt
enticed to put some color in my hair
you
I can't live without you I can't live
down
I love it I think it's so it's such a
subtle nice like change but it's also
only four to eight shampoos so like it
doesn't need to be permanent I'm very
happy with it I'm happy that my high
school hair doing skills decided to rise
up within its makeovers been great I
already feel like a new person I think I
might do it again and go like more ham
on the pink but just adding a little bit
of pink to my hair and you know like
changing up my nails I wet and got my
nails done I'm not even mad about this
horrible lighting because sunshine in
the winter it's a blessing like we've
already discussed so I'm actually just
about to head to my nail appointment I'm
super excited what color should I do we
shall just see what happens we'll just
let fate decide won't we fate always has
our back they never lets us down
remember when I was like let's let fate
decide so this is the color I ended up
going with it's like a matte pink
it's called fate so when I said let's
let fate decide I guess fate decided I
think because we're humans were such
visual beings and even just having that
visual representation or that visual
reminder of the transformation you're
kind of trying to create in your life
you go at it with the right mindset
meaning like a little bit of pink in
your hair for some fun or getting your
nails done it can be very uplifting but
just a little reminder which I'm sure
you guys don't need but I feel like
sometimes I need it every once in a
while this can also turn into something
a little toxic if you're not careful of
your intentions or your mindset going
into it so try and make the physical
changes that you're looking for like
positive and uplifting ie not going into
it with the mindset of like I'm not
pretty enough I need to get prettier or
whatever it is like when it comes to
giving your life a makeover don't change
your physical aspects with the intention
of feeling like you're not good enough
so you need to change it to be better
instead do it from the mindset of you
know I want to give myself a little
refresher and this is something that's
going to feel uplifting and
transformative that Lee is killing me
right now he's just like he's so content
I just want to be this content Bentley
didn't choose the thug life the thug
life chose Bentley and we're back I
always love filming vlogs like this
because it doesn't have to be a
chronological in terms of when I film
what Clips so it kind of leaves
everybody guessing like what day did she
film what magic
the third category when it comes to
giving yourself a mini life makeover and
to be
honest it's my personal favorite which I
don't think is gonna come as a surprise
it is your atmosphere and right now my
atmosphere is very we've kind of let
ourselves go a little bit here one is
that I just have too much stuff and two
is that I just haven't had enough time
to kind of chunk out to just go through
everything donate the things that I'm
not using anymore organized things back
into their place just in general to
rearrange where things are I am a huge
huge believer as young as I can remember
I always used to change around my
bedroom when I was a kid I would push
around my furniture or my parents would
give me trouble all the time my space is
my space like this place my apartment is
my safe place it is my sanctuary come
back and I recharge my batteries so that
I can go back out into the world and
feel like myself I'm super geeky about
the stuff I believe in but one of the
things that I honestly think is really
true is that everything has energy even
the room that I'm sitting in right now
has energy your perspective on the
things that you own and the way that you
handle and care things that are yours is
kind of like passing between two things
of energy for that reason I think
atmosphere is super important and I
think that that's why when my place is
messy I feel like my brains kind of
messy but when things are clean and what
I'm like respecting the things that I've
worked hard to get or own I just feel
good I feel better so I'm gonna clean
the crap out of this apartment organize
everything pull things out of cubbies
just like read like let's just we're
just gonna go to town guys we're going
hard-core Monica Geller
you
I can't leave
I can't breathe
you
you
you
you cleaning this closet Oh actually
took me so much longer than I thought I
literally okay I'm gonna pull out this
chair I'm not like awkwardly squatting
was working on this closet until almost
midnight last night not only did I get
rid of so many things I have four big
massive garbage bags full of clothes I'm
gonna go take them right now and donate
them so all that's left to do is just
organizing my desk everything else has
been cleaned or organized in some way
which feels so good I already feel like
even just walking into this room and
seeing how everything is just like
organized so differently I feel I just
feel refreshed you know
so the atmospheric part of this you know
life makeover is officially done I hung
up some new neon lights I'll leave links
to them down below actually found them
on Amazon I went and grabbed some new
fresh flowers from the grocery store I
got those like pink purple orchids which
have been totally like they're literally
the same color as my hair pick those up
and put them in my kitchen they're in a
central area I'm gonna see them all the
time I've been really getting into
plants lately I feel like this year I'm
really gonna you know start exploring my
green thumb so now I'm just gonna head
it I'm gonna go do some yoga hit the gym
shower get ready I have a video to film
I have all my stuff for the video like
chillin on the side here and then we'll
catch back up in a bit we have two more
sections of this life makeover to do and
the next one is goal-setting which is
also a personal favor fine
you
a fourth category when it comes to
giving your life a mini makeover is
school setting there's so many different
ways to do this and I feel like I've
done so many different videos and
different avenues of this topic but just
in general I feel like it can be so easy
to kind of lose sight or lose focus on
the type of goals that we're kind of
chasing and when we lose that sight our
lives feel like they become very bland
and kind of mundane so when giving your
life a mini makeover I feel like
establishing your goals may be setting
some new goals and then finding a way to
kind of make it fun is such an easy way
to give your life that little like pump
of energy that it needs last night I did
a insert in my bullet journal I did this
little habit tracker these are all of
the habits that I kind of want to work
on over the next little bit and then
every day that I do each habit I'm gonna
fill it in with a color for each square
all the way to March fist some of these
are habits that I was already trying to
work on but when I was writing them down
I was kind of reestablishing why I want
to do them whether it's doing yoga
everyday meditating every day and then I
threw in some new ones to cleaning for
15 minutes every day flossing every day
doing some research every single day or
every single day just little things like
that and then I also did a progress
tracker on my closet door for that all I
did was write down the three biggest
goals that I'm trying to work on right
now and then kind of like taking a
bullet journal and putting it on to the
closet I'm using post-it notes as a
progress tracker to show how far I am
done ten squares means that I haven't
even started and then as each square
gets pulled off it's just something else
that I've done that's kind of gotten me
closer to finishing that goal it's such
an easy simple thing to do but again
because I feel like we're such visual
beings and such visual creatures having
things up on your wall whether it be
mood boards whether it's leaving this
set on your desk to fill out every day
whether it's doing a progress tracker on
your closet door on your bedroom door
having those visual kind of accessories
in your life are not only going to make
it fun and attractive to kind of go
after those goals but I feel like it
also works it's a little bit of magic by
seeing it every day because even if
you're not consciously thinking about it
subconsciously it's in your peripheral
vision you're seeing it and it's kind of
constantly reminding you of what you're
striving and working towards and making
your life feel refreshed
so last and finally not least the final
category when it comes to giving your
life a mini makeover or your surrounding
forces these include the relationships
in your life the people that you
surround yourself with I think if you're
kind of like broody and not very happy
you might attract more people like that
into your life and if you're upbeat or
you're trying to establish good habits
it doesn't necessarily mean you have to
cut the people that are doing those
things out of your life it might just
mean that you want to start shifting
your time to doing more uplifting things
or spending time with more uplifting
people I think when it comes to
surrounding forces the best way to kind
of lift your own life is to service
other people first which is why I don't
think if you're going through like a
life makeover or some sort of
transformation that you feel you need
it's good to cut people out that maybe
aren't doing the same thing instead turn
around and find a way to help others
find a way without kind of like being
patronizing or condescending but just
just literally turn around and from a
good place with good intention do good
for other people because no matter if
you do everything else or anything else
in this video I think if you are
constantly kind of thinking of others
before you think of yourself even if it
comes from a place of wanting to make
yourself feel good I still think that
that is a good thing for instance when
I'm doing yoga and Bentley's barking at
me to go outside instead of getting
frustrated and annoyed I look at it as
this is a chance for me to service
Bentley and put him first instead of
like my yoga practice first if that it's
a really small example of what I mean if
you already have people in your life
that you think are good or uplifting are
influential people then take that
surrounding force and give to it give
good to it like bake them cookies put
your time and your effort and your
investment into things that surround
your life that make you feel good and
taking the time to give to those parts
of your life taking the time to kind of
plan out make plans with people that are
important to you make things like
cookies or muffins for the people that
you love or for the people that always
do the best or want the best for you
that lifts your outside forces which
then turns around and again vibe
attracts tribe lifts your own 5 also was
sitting down and planning I'm planning
up my week for next week not only can
you punch out time to spend with people
that you know inspire you or influence
you in a good way this is also a good
to kind of push yourself outside your
comfort zone because your surrounding
forces aren't just people your
surrounding forces are also the
opportunities that are sitting just
right outside of your realm of existence
waiting for you to jump on them trying
out a new yoga class looking up or
researching a trip somewhere or looking
at the people even if they're strangers
like someone on the side of the road
those are surrounding forces to that you
can kind of map out like if for instance
it might be hard to kind of plan to run
into somebody that might change your
life but what you could do start a habit
or plan a habit like I want to talk to
one new person every single day or I
want to go to one new fitness class
every single week planning out habits
like that putting yourself into new
circumstances trying out new things
those are things that you can plan for
and let fate or the universe you know
decide the rest so I'm now going to
finish planning out the rest of my week
incorporating my new goals and habits
planning around to for pink in my hair
and I also just bought a trapeze thing
to do aerial yoga in my own apartment so
that's gonna be even just another thing
to add to my atmospheric makeover with
that I hope you guys enjoyed today's
