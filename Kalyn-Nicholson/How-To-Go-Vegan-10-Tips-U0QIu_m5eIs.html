something that is part of my actual
everyday life by no means I don't want
you guys to ever feel like if you're
watching this and I'm like forcing this
on you this is just if you are
interested in becoming vegan then that
is like this is a video for you to be
watching I don't want you guys to ever
feel like I'm pushy or feel like I'm
preachy because I don't try to be but I
also do get very passionate about things
and I get I do like I believe in a lot
of things anyway I don't know what I'm
trying to say before a long time I kind
of held off on making a video like this
because I was afraid of that and then I
realized how stupid that is that I'm not
getting a message out there or like you
know there might be one or two people
maybe even more than one or two people
watching this video that have thought
about going vegan and just never
actually did it and so this is just me
trying to get my message out there it's
not me trying to push be pushy or
preachy whatsoever just have to get that
disclaimer out there so yeah this is for
those of you guys that are interested in
veganism because veganism is awesome
which is why I'm wearing this shirt and
it's raining out and it sounds so pretty
and it's so nice and I'm freezing cold
got a nice you know candle burning so I
am cozy AF right now so for those of you
guys watching that I've thought about
going vegan I'm gonna share with you
guys ten tips on how to go vegan by
trial-and-error from my own life and
just things that helped me along the way
and things that I don't know I just I've
learned as I've like been vegan for
quite a bit of time now so if you guys
don't know I actually went vegan in high
school then I fell off the bandwagon
and went back vegan in what year was it
um 2013 I went back vegan thanks to
freelee the banana girl I was watching
some of her videos this was a long
before she had so much hate and
controversy but this is when she was
making more strictly like documentary
type videos and they were all very like
point to the point and very like
informative and a lot of information and
it was because of those videos that I
stumble on on YouTube one day that I
actually went back to going vegan in
2013
so if freely banana girl ever watches
this um thank you because you put me
back on the bandwagon if you guys see me
looking down it's because I wrote them
down because I didn't want to forget it
because I want this video to be very
informative and helpful for you guys so
so tip number one is to ask yourself why
you want to go vegan so this is I think
what my problem was kind of the first
time I kind of had an idea why I wanted
to go vegan but I didn't really do my
research or look into it or whatever so
I was like I think I want to go vegan
because of this but I didn't actually
know very much information about it so
ask yourself why you want to go vegan
is it because of the environmental
issues is it because of health reasons
is it because of the ethics or the
animal rights or just ask yourself
exactly what it is that makes you want
to go vegan and this is important
because when you have those days where
you really want to fail you really just
want to like dive into a pizza or
cheeseburger or whatever um this is
what's going to kind of anchor you back
into staying vegan and then kind of like
a follow point to that is number two do
your research so this has been the
biggest thing that I found has helped me
and it's doing research and not just
research on like animal cruelty and
stuff like that but also research on how
veganism has helped heals people's
bodies it's helped healed cancers like
it's crazy the things that going vegan
can do so do your research and I'm going
to leave a bunch of links in the
description box of things that you guys
can read things you guys can watch I'll
leave documentaries I'll leave books
I'll leave a whole whack of fun stuff in
the description box but just a few
things off the top of my head if you're
not really into like searching things on
the internet or you don't want to read
through forums and such try watching
like
commentary's like cowspiracy theory
forks over knives earthlings
those are my top three favorites and if
you're looking for like a book try
reading something like Skinny Bitch that
sounds a little bit misleading so much
jam-packed awesome information about
veganism in it but it's hilarious it's a
great book there by two women and
they're hilarious and it's a really
really good book and really informative
and it's not dry if you know what I mean
like you're not reading it being like
this is really boring information they
wrote it in a very interesting way so
those are just a few examples but I'll
leave a bunch of links of things down
below as well as just like youtubers and
just places and things you can go and
watch and read and all that fun stuff so
you guys can get your research in Oh tip
number three and this was also a huge
help for me when I went vegan is to try
and get a friend on board the tripod
went vegan my sister went back vegan my
sister had gone vegan at the same time
with me and we decided to do it together
because we were traveling on to the East
Coast and we ended up our plane anyways
long story short we ended up on a
shuttle bus to get to where we had to go
and it had Wi-Fi so I'm showing her
freelee the banana girl's videos at the
time and there was ones about like what
happens to cows and what happens to all
these animals and I was also reading the
book Skinny Bitch at the time so I was
reading like I read something and we
were in the hotel room one day and I was
like bawling my eyes out and she's what
is wrong and I read out exactly what it
was and she instantly and I'm talking
like my sister was a huge meat-eater
like a crazy meat-eater she loves steak
she loved like all of that stuff and she
went cold turkey vegan with me it was so
much easier to kind of have somebody to
bounce ideas off of and now the awesome
thing is that now my roommate Maggie
she's vegan so her and I always have
like fun times like making dinner will
Black's music will each make like an
awesome vegan dinner then we'll always
try each other's recipes and all that
fun stuff so having someone to kind of
you know bounce ideas off of and talk to
or just like come up with recipes
together and all of that stuff and do
research and whatever it's just it still
makes it a lot easier so you don't feel
like you know you're drifting out there
in the middle of the ocean by yourself
because I remember the first time I went
vegan I didn't know anyone else I was
vegan and I would go places or go out to
eat or go over to a friend's house and
I'd have to be like Oh vegan so number
four is Pinterest Google and cookbooks
are going to be
your best friend and I say this because
people might think veganism is boring or
that there's not much to eat but there's
actually so many ridiculously amazing
and easy recipes you guys can make most
of your favorite foods can probably be
mimin most of your favorite foods can
probably be made into a vegan recipe I
have made mac and cheese I have made
grilled cheeses
I have veggie burgers every now and then
I have had so many amazing foods vegan
pizza it's like so many things that you
would think can't be vegan there's a
vegan recipe for it and it's pretty damn
good make a Pinterest board of just
vegan recipes and pin a bunch of recipes
and try some and you can find easier
ones you don't have to do all these hard
ones or you know Google something that
day like if you're craving let's say mac
and cheese Google a vegan mac and cheese
recipe throw on some music and just like
you know what try a new recipe whip up
something good trial and error and
that's the fun part about veganism is
that there's like a whole new world of
exploring food and I am somebody that I
actually love cooking so it's so fun to
me to always try like all these new
recipes so if you guys want a video I'm
planning on doing a future fitness
Friday video either in November or
December just like vegan dinner ideas
and then maybe I'll do one for breakfast
and lunch and snacks as well but if you
guys want that either just thumbs up or
let me know down below and I can
definitely do that for you guys because
that's what makes it so much fun is if
you're constantly kind of changing up
while you eat and trying new things that
are vegan it's going to make it a lot
more fun for you so number five is to
keep in mind that you're going to make
mistakes and I'm not saying that because
I don't want to set you up for like
failure but all I'm saying is that
anyone that's gone vegan has probably
had this happen where they eat something
and then they find out afterwards that
there was like agony or they find out
afterwards that something was in it that
was a vegan and that has happened to me
is happened happened to me like a month
ago and I was like oh are you kidding me
and then I'm like Kay well there's
nothing I can do I already ate it so
whatever like I'm not going to beat
myself up for it keep in mind you're
probably going to make mistakes it's so
hard to tell sometimes when things are
and aren't vegan so a lot of the times
I'll like bring a lunch or bring a
dinner somewhere or if there's baked
goods I'll usually just completely sear
clear of them so just show your best and
don't beat yourself up if you
accidentally eat something that was
vegan or you know what don't beat
yourself up if you cave one day
and either play to nachos you're still
transitioning you're still adjusting all
I'm trying to say is that you're a human
we live in a world that is so not vegan
I guess you could say if you're making
this transition like that's a huge step
in itself so don't expect to be perfect
you know what I mean
so number six is to keep staples in your
house and by staples I'd be like rice
veggies potatoes um rice veggies
potatoes bananas things like that things
that are going to keep you full soups
beans I like to keep those things like
on stock I always like to have a couple
cans of soup in my cot in my pantry a
bag of rice some frozen veggies in case
I run out of fresh ones and potatoes
those are like bananas of course but
like those are like the main things I
always try and keep stocked at home so
that I'm never like oh my gosh I have
nothing to eat those are the staples I
try and keep around the house because
they're high in carbs meaning I'm going
to stay full and have a lot of energy
throughout the day which leads me to
point number seven which is to eat
enough and that is so so so so important
and that was my first mistake when I
first went vegan is that I wasn't eating
enough so I went from eating like a
normal meal and I was vegetarian before
I went vegan but that said like I would
eat like a banana for breakfast and then
I would have like a salad for lunch and
then I would be starving and then that's
when your cravings are gonna kick in so
make sure you're eating enough food
you're gonna need to eat a lot more as a
vegan but that's like the blessing in
disguise that you can eat a lot more as
a vegan pay attention to your cravings
because when you're craving something
your body is actually trying to tell you
something and I think that's so cool I
don't know why I'm such a dork for that
stuff but like if you're craving like
cheese your problem you probably just
want some salt your body's like I want
salt and if you're craving like a steak
your body is probably trying to tell you
I need a little bit of iron also if
you're craving like sweets you probably
just need to eat some fruit some banana
bananas and stuff also keep in mind the
longer that you're vegan the more your
cravings go away so Ryan actually
recently turned vegetarian and he talks
about craving this stuff all the time
and I'm just like no because I've been
vegetarian since I was 13 so I don't
crave like chicken I don't cry
mave steak I don't crave like burgers I
don't crave anything like that I crave
veggie burgers but um I don't really get
those types of cravings anymore so the
longer you are vegan or vegetarian or
whatever um the more the cravings are
going to start to go away but at the
same time do pay attention to what your
cravings are because it's your body
probably trying to tell you something so
so my last and final tip and it's tip
number 10
this one is more so just for like once
you go vegan or once you've been really
into it really researching it there's
something that I I just personally my
own opinion feel like needs to be like
important or said and that is to share
the message with love and I say that
sounds so corny but I mean like the
stigma against vegans is that they think
they're better than people or that
they're very pushy or that their way is
the only way and I personally believe
that veganism is the healthiest way to
live and the most ethical way to live
but that is my own personal opinion and
I can't force that on anybody else and
especially in a very hateful way but if
you want other people to respect your
beliefs then you have to respect other
people's beliefs and also keep an open
mind so fair and I'm telling you guys
this from my own trial and error from me
becoming very angry when I first found
out a lot of the information about being
vegan um I don't know I got very angry
and I was very upset about the way the
world was kind of I didn't know that the
world had I don't know there's something
when you look when you do the research
you guys might know what I mean but when
you learn the truth behind what actually
happens to you know animals and the
truth behind it all you get almost angry
at first and then your message can come
across as very harsh and very pushy I'm
sorry for clapping my hands so I
mentioned in the last video I do this a
lot and I know I do sorry but um all I'm
trying to say I don't know I feel like
I've been a little all over the place
this video all I'm trying to say is that
I did get very angry and so I had very
high expectations not only for myself
but for people around me and I started
to become a little bit pushy and this is
a while ago but I'm starting to realize
or I've especially recently started to
realize that you know what other people
it's everybody lives a different
if everybody's body is different
everybody's belief system is different
everybody's feelings are different
emotions are different their minds are
different so you can't get angry you can
only share veganism with love and I know
it sounds very corny but I just mean
like we should all just try and say
open-minded we should all try and learn
as much as we can about the world that
we live in and the way the world is
working and the way things are happening
and open our eyes without without being
hateful and without being mean to each
other and without thinking that one way
of living is a better way than another
way of living or like one person is
better than another person because of
what they choose to do that is all I had
to say and get out there so that's it I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I will
leave my tips on my blog or in the
description box so you guys can have
like an overview of them anyways I love
you guys to the moon and back and thank
you guys so much for watching and I will
see you guys all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
