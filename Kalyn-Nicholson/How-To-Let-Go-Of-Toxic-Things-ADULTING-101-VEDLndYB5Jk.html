he's thinking worse please you would be
astonished how cold it is in this little
Airbnb MN despite the fact that it's
literally a desert out there hey guys
what's up and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm doing another
coffee talk with you guys just because
the coffee talks turned into a podcast I
promise you guys that keep doing them on
this channel and I did one before I went
to Thailand but I still I have noticed
like I was scrolling through my channel
and noticed that I haven't done as many
coffee talks as I used to I mean there
is balance the fact that they are
podcasts now but still I felt inspired
as I just kind of showed you I am
currently in Arizona here with Bentley
he's taking a little nap and his
carry-on thingy over there
I initially was gonna try and film
facing this way so you guys would have
like the desert behind me as I talked
some real life things too you can't
really see me play around with the
aperture gonna so that would have been
like the happy median but like no so
instead Here I am sitting with the
Airbnb behind me which you guys look at
a tour of in my Phoenix puppy adventures
video I don't Lee has been loving the
heat let me just say so part of the
reason aside from obviously wanting to
take Bentley more places add to his like
roster of existence on this earth I've
heard so many good things about this
place I've heard that this is a really
good place to go to meditate to do yoga
to kind of just the Zen out and so I
decided to do exactly that and then
throw Bentley in so that he could also
come and enjoy the hot Sun although it's
a little low like a little too hot we're
gonna go on a hike tonight during sunset
because it's a little bit cooler and the
Sun isn't so hot in the meantime in
those pockets in between I've been doing
a lot of meditation even though this has
only been like day two of us being here
it's been
so there is something about there is
something about the desert that is very
therapeutic each day I've kind of had a
different theme that I've been trying to
meditate on and work on or like write
out or journal about these things like
pulled up to the surface so that I can
deal with them and kind of leave them
behind here for when I go home and one
of the biggest things are one of the
biggest themes yesterday was the things
that I wanted to let go of the things
that I was still kind of holding on to
or clutching on to that yesterday did
this like very big ritual was myself
just super lame but it honestly was very
therapeutic and it was something that
helped me pull to the surface all of the
things that I knew we're still kind of
stuck in my craw and deal with them face
them head-on
not only that kind of released their
energy and their hold on me and also
kind of thanked them for what they were
and then let them go and so with that I
felt kind of inspired to do this coffee
talk today so I I decided to film it and
just get it up for you guys because I
did have a vlog I had a coffee Chronicle
but I don't know this was felt more
right I guess in life there's always
gonna be tons of things that we kind of
need to let go of for some of us it
could be jobs it could be toxic
friendships
it could be relationships it could be
even losing somebody unexpectedly it can
be bad habits we have with ourselves or
a bad relationship that we have with
ourselves
we're very multifaceted you know like we
think a lot of things at the same time
and so while sometimes we might be on a
good page with ourselves there might be
this one little ugly voice inside our
head that creeps in every other day or
so that you want to kind of let go of
this could even boil down to wanting to
let go of our attachments and our
expectations because those are also
things that we do need to let go of in
order to live happier and more abundant
and more free lives and also open our
minds to what's actually in front of us
rather than the expectations that we
kind of put on ourselves there's just
basically there's a lot of things that
in this lifetime we're always gonna have
to be letting go of I think no matter
what we should constantly be shed our
skins and we should constantly evolve
and change and really try to make these
things a ritual make this letting go a
ritual because it clears us from our
attachments that we might not even real
that we're holding on to and it helps us
evolve into better people on a like
regular basis leaving behind what no
longer serves us and opening up more
space and room for new things to come
into our lives so in doing my ritual
last night and then waking up today and
like stretching in the Sun I'm gonna
share with you guys how exactly to let
go of things in your life that no longer
serve you and why you need to so with
that let us begin so first things first
we need to realize what is it in our
lives that we need to let go of where is
the venom in your life if you were like
a snake and you're shedding you're
shedding that skin you're trying to
evolve into you know a larger better
snake you have to figure out where the
venom is because once you figure out
what the venom is you're able to get rid
of it in order to release yourself and
almost shed or release that skin I guess
it's kind of gross but I don't know
we're rolling with it for me I wrote it
all down last night I basically wrote
down what do I want to let go of and
anything that just boiled to the surface
whether I even really thought it made
sense or not I was just kind of writing
it all down just almost like a
brainstorm which I talked to you guys
about and my plan was me for June but
I've been loving brain storms lately or
brain nets where if you just want to
find an answer but you're feeling a
little clouded write it out and
everything that comes to your mind you
just literally just put it on the page
put it on the page even if it makes
absolutely no sense
because then from there you take that
brain web or you take that brain storm
and then you organize your thoughts and
so from there I was able to kind of see
the things in my life that I was ready
to let go of and I was ready to kind of
say my goodbyes to this can be anything
from like mind sets to memories you want
to let go over anything that feels like
it's kind of holding you captive or it's
like keeping you stuck where you're at
put it down on the paper what is causing
you to have like a venomous feel or what
is leaking a little bit of poison into
your life or what is it that makes you
feel super negative really get honest
with yourself take some time to sit down
and write those things out because that
is ultimately going to give you a very
clear indication of what areas of your
life you need to shed some skin but
doing this you're also gonna become
super aware of the things that you're
holding on to because they hold the
place in your heart or
is that they hold a place with your ego
and the ego is not just like you know
walking around with your chest puffed
out I think the ego is the part of us
that tries to keep us safe and that's
why our ego is so hard to deal with
that's another video for another time
our ego is something that holds on to
false illusions of things to make
ourselves feel better really fast rather
than feel better long-term so you
realize the things that you're holding
on to because your ego is actually
holding on to it not your truest sense
of self because your truer sense of self
would know that it's something that is
negative or it's something that is gonna
hurt you more in the long haul so
therefore it knows you need to let go of
it even if it's gonna hurt so I suggest
you take some time find a quiet place go
for a drive even I was outside last
night when I was writing all my note and
the sky was just kind of shifting from
day to night and I was just writing all
these things out and and it felt so
therapeutic and it doesn't need to be
all mushy gushy you could literally just
be putting it into your phone if you
want to just find a quiet time a quiet
space and get real with yourself and
like ask yourself those questions what
has been holding you back what is
getting in your way what has been
weighing on you what's no longer serving
you is it a job is it a friendship is it
a relationship or a habit with yourself
get so real on this because then in step
two we're gonna say our goodbyes and
trust me here's the thing about goodbyes
I'm not I'm not good at goodbyes okay
once I care about something or I attach
or I let something become important to
me it's really hard for me to let it go
I have a big barrier but once anything
gets past that barrier with me it's like
a Ryder dice I don't let things or
people into my life very easily and I
know this about myself but once
something is in my life it's really hard
for me to fully let it go because I like
cherish things and I cherish people and
I cherish even just like the symbolism
of things like even just as stupid as I
used to collect birthday cards for years
and years of my life and it took me so
long to finally be like why I I'm never
gonna look through these birthday cards
but I couldn't let them go it's just one
of those weird things where I tend to
hold on to things and attach to things
or even people or relationships or even
habits because they symbolize something
to me so if the thought of saying
goodbye kind of freaks you out no there
not alone I get that too but you have to
and I think that you can't just expect
to let things go without actually saying
goodbye to them because letting things
go is like letting it walk at the door
but saying goodbye is shutting the door
on your end because I love to write I
decided to write these things out I
literally wrote goodbye letters I know
that's so lame it helped me get
everything out that I needed and not
only that it helps me almost talk myself
through having to say goodbye you don't
have to write it out you can type it out
in your phone or you can even verbalize
it you can just say it out loud or think
it in your mind but no matter what when
it comes to going through the goodbye
portion or saying goodbye to whatever it
is that you need to let go of this is
the formula that I followed first you
address what you need to say goodbye to
this is the part where you feel caught
in a Lane where you're like dear bad
habit do your job dear insert name here
and then it immediately follow up the
addressing of what it is that you're
saying goodbye to with a thank you thank
it for whatever it brought into your
life because obviously it brought
something to your life or else it
wouldn't have been there even if it's
just thank you for teaching me this it
could be something that was so crappy it
could be something that was so hard for
you to deal with but you're ready to let
it go and with letting it go you have to
thank it for the presence it held in
your life because it ultimately taught
you something brought you a lesson or
brought you a sense of joy at some point
in your life and doing this is going to
release your regret this is going to
make it so that you can't look back and
regret any decision you made any bad
habit you had or feel guilty about
staying in a relationship too long or
staying in a friendship too long or a
job too long that wasn't good for you
because you're saying thank you and then
not only that because I'm a bit of an
empath okay so like I tend to look at
all things or I try to look at all
things with an emotional sense or like
in a compassionate way I even feel like
sometimes like what's my even my plants
I'm like why do I think my plants have
feelings but for some reason it's I've
been that way since I was a kid even if
you feel crazy it works more so for you
than it does for it and what I mean is
think it or comfort it for the role that
it played in your life let it know that
it was important to you at one point and
just because it can no longer be in your
life anymore it doesn't mean that you
didn't appreciate its role which in turn
and the reason why I say to do this is
because this is for you to accept it
this is for you to accept that it did
play a role in your life and by
comforting it so it kind of puts you
back in the driver's seat and it lets
you accept what has to happen the next
one and this is gonna be one that's a
little harder but you need to forgive
whatever it is that you're trying to let
go of forgive it for not being something
that can have a place in your life
anymore forgive it for not holding up to
the expectation you had forgive your
current reality for not having a place
for this thing anymore forgive just
forgive forgive forgive because when you
forgive whatever it is you're letting go
of it'll make the letting go part so
much easier and this includes forgiving
yourself for clinging to it for so long
it's okay to let yourself off the hook
for wanting to attach to things that
made you feel good or attached the
things that made you feel safe we all
want to feel good we all want to feel
safe and sometimes we don't realize
we're even doing it but we cling to the
fastest thing that's going to give us
that feeling because in a lot of ways in
this world especially we all tend to
fear the unknown we all tend to fear
letting go of things that give us a
sense of identity so forgive yourself
for holding on to it for so long - and
if you're writing a letter add that part
in there it's important and then
ultimately after forgiving it explain
why you need to let it go and again this
is more for you than for it nobody's
ever gonna see this letter if you're
writing this to a person like an ex a
friend that you're letting go over even
a family member you're letting go of or
you're even writing this - a bad habit
or a bad situation or a job you still
need to write out the explanation as to
why you need to let it go and I think
that this is one of the most important
parts of this process because it makes
it very clear to you why you're letting
it go it's like I need to let you go
because I need to make space I need to
move on you are toxic for me even if the
explanation is as simple as I need to
let you go so that I have more space
more room for a more positive thing in
my life that's a good enough explanation
and that's also going to be important in
later on because nothing is ever set in
stone hopefully once you finish going
through all the steps in this video
you will feel like you've let go of
whatever it is you need to but if you
ever falter if you ever fall back on
wondering what if this explanation as to
why you needed to let it go is going to
be the quick fix to get you right out of
the
what if mindset into it that's why
mindset and then ultimately end your
goodbyes or end your goodbye letter with
best wishes and best intentions for them
and yourself in the future because doing
this means that you're holding no anger
or resentment to whatever it is you're
letting go of you've let go and you hope
basically for the best of all or not at
all if you're not gonna walk away from
whatever it is you're letting go of
hoping the best for not only yourself
with that thing then you're ultimately
not actually letting go you're still
holding on to an anger or resentment
towards it so when you can forgive and
walk away wishing the best for that
company that you're walking away from
that person you're walking away from or
if you are doing this in terms of bad
habits or bad mindsets or bad
expectations or expectations that
weren't reached or a change that's
happened within yourself then you can
end this instead of best wishes for the
other thing since it's not really
another thing you can end it with the
seeds that you're going to set now
that's going to fill the space that
you're letting go of basically write
down the person that you're about to
transform into with letting these things
go but that said let me just reiterate
if you're letting go of a person a
company a job or anything along those
lines then I highly suggest you end it
with best wishes and best intentions for
them in the future to that they find
happiness that they work through
whatever they need to work through or
that they end up being exactly where
they need to be and you end up being
exactly where you need to be so that all
parties are happy and at the end of the
day it all happened for a reason
step number three is to clear the space
or clean the slate so this is gonna be
the hardest portion of the letting go
because once you've figured out what you
need to let go of in your life and you
say your goodbyes to it the following
step is actually letting it go it's
actually releasing the grip you have on
whatever it is because saying goodbye is
one thing but like I said shutting the
door is a whole other and this is the
shutting of the door and shedding of the
skin and it's the hardest part because
it's uncomfortable it makes us sad it
makes us kind of angry it makes us
irritable it makes us tired it makes us
kind of lose a sense of clarity within
ourselves and this is usually the step
where a lot of people that are trying to
let go of things in your life and maybe
you've tried letting go of this thing
before but you end up falling back into
it
this is usually the step we fumble we
forget why we're letting
go and then we fall back or we race back
or we jump back into it and grab onto it
with like both hands because we're so
afraid of the unknown we're so
uncomfortable with how we feel within
ourselves trying to let that go that we
misinterpret that discomfort as okay
well maybe I was supposed to have that
thing or else I wouldn't be this sad or
why am I so angry or suddenly I can't
remember why I needed to let this thing
go maybe I'm making a huge mistake you
know we start to lose that trust within
ourselves this is where we need to take
action this is where we need to fully
shed the skin it's not gonna be easy and
it's not gonna be comfortable but I'm
telling you it'll be so rewarding if you
stick to your guns by taking action I
mean get rid of triggers get rid of bad
habits get rid of the memories the
memorabilia is like delete contacts in
your phone if you have to do whatever
you have to do that's going to make you
ultimately release that grip and only
you were gonna know what needs to be let
go of like it could be if you're letting
go of relationship it could be a memory
box you had of all of these like tickets
or Momentum's if it's a negative person
or a negative friend in your life it
could be deleting that contact after you
say goodbye and you can also by the way
in step 2 give that goodbye to somebody
if they ask you can tell them but
ultimately it's up to you why you're
letting this person go and you're doing
it for you but also for them in a way so
that is totally up to your judgment I
mean if you're in a relationship and
they don't know you're letting them go
odds are you should probably break up
with said person before you just go
deleting them off your phone get your
ducks in a row so that you can let it
all go
Wow that rhymed but get your ducks in a
row so you can actually let things go if
you're doing this for bad habits or
whatever then this would be you know
taking the junk food out of your fridge
if the thing you're trying to let go of
is your poor eating habits
it could even be signing up for a gym
membership if you're trying to let go of
the lazier version of yourself do what
you have to do to actually get rid of
the things and shed the layers of skin
another really good way to do this if
you are you know someone like me who
wrote the letters you can burn them and
with burning them you're kind of
releasing their energy and now that
you've said your goodbyes that is you
letting it go and just being like burn
away it be kind to yourself as you
stretch and kind of like shed all of
these things because it is going to be
hard it's going to be taxing it's going
to make you feel a lot of emotions it's
gonna bring a lot of things up to the
surface for you easy on yourself
understand that it's totally normal to
feel sad to feel clouded judgment to
feel a sense of disconnect within
yourself because you're evolving into a
new sense of being and let yourself kind
of go through those growing pains of
letting things go in your life every
time that you feel like you want to just
cling right back to whatever it is that
you had that you know you have to let go
of remind yourself of exactly why this
thing wasn't good for you why you need
to let go of it and what its gonna mean
once you do the space that it's gonna
create in your life for the person
you're gonna be able to become because
you're letting this thing go I read that
in the natural world when a snake sheds
its skin during the shedding process the
snake is visibly uncomfortable and
unproductive is irritable and sluggish
its devoting all of its energy to this
one task of ridding the old to make way
for the new when you know that that's
normal
you'll know that you won't want to turn
around and climb back into the skin you
know just keep pushing and trust me when
you get on the other side that's in the
best part is about to happen which leads
me to step number four and that is
embrace the new you or just embrace the
new in general let me embrace the new
you is a little corny but true embrace a
new you once you finally let go and you
finally evolved at first you're gonna be
like whoa you're gonna feel so free
ultimately afterwards I'm almost kind of
in shock and that shock tends to kind of
build up a little bit of anxiety or a
little bit of fear because again once
you've let it go you have this open
space where something used to be and
your first reaction could be or might be
holy but don't be afraid don't let
it make you hermit into another type of
safety or jump to another bad thing
that's just going to make you feel just
as crappy as the last thing did you no
longer fit in that old skin and that's
why you had to shed it so that you could
grow larger but also so you could grow
lighter now
to stay open-minded now is the time to
embrace the new and to just jump on new
things and kind of explore this new
sense of openness and freedom and
lightness with yourself because you're
almost like in the in-between you know
you've let go of something and maybe
something hasn't taken its place yet
maybe you haven't found the new job you
haven't you know filled that space with
anything new yet but trust me the
universe is cooking you up something
good and it's okay to be in the
in-between there's nothing wrong with
embracing that part of your life that in
between mode of from one thing to
another
you just made so much room for new
memories and new experiences in your
life so get out there in your new skin
your new snake body you know go see
what's waiting like there's so much
fruit to be bared
Thanks don't just shed their skin once
ok I'm going on with the snake thing
because it's just worked out so
perfectly but as they grow and continue
to evolve they constantly need to shed
skin so this won't be the only time in
our lives that we need to shed that we
need to let things go
realize that it's just another part of
your evolution it's just another part of
your growth as an individual and as a
human being here on this earth give
yourself some credit for stepping up to
the plate and making it happen rather
than letting it happen to you because
ultimately things that don't serve us in
our lives
relationships jobs bad habits whatever
it is if you don't face those things and
you don't let them go on your own
eventually they will come at you from a
different angle and that can be from
illness it can be from an even worse
heartbreak ultimately eventually whether
by force or by choice those things will
find a way to release themselves from
you if they're not serving you we as
human beings to our core we don't want
to hold on to things that don't serve us
but I think our ego gets in our way and
forces us to cling on to things but
trust me your higher self or you know
your true self within it's stronger than
your ego even if you don't feel that so
no matter how hard your ego holds on to
something ultimately fate or destiny
will come in and find a way to make sure
that those things get out of your life
your body does not want the poison your
soul your life your whatever you believe
in does not want that negativity in your
life so give yourself credit
for actually releasing it by choice
rather than by force and for sucking the
venom out of your life I'm just I
the snake metaphors are just everything
right now and also too now's the time to
be a little selfish let me rephrase now
is the time for some self-care because
self-care isn't selfish now's the time
to do things for you now is the time to
explore to try some new things to see
what other things are waiting out there
for you that you could even give a go
whether it works for you or not now's
the time to play with life to test the
waters and above all just trust yourself
trust the timing of your life trust that
you know what's best for you
and trust a new expansive version of
yourself as you grow into this wiser
more experienced version of who you are
trust me when I say when you get to this
part of letting go that the hard part is
over and the fun has only just begun
and your life is about to make a huge
turn just local so there you guys have
it I hope you guys enjoyed today's
coffee talk all about letting things go
I felt again very inspired by this
because it was something that I did my
own little ritual with last night and
then in two days I'm gonna be burning my
own letters things that I'm going to be
talking about in the Arizona vlog so
definitely watch out for that that will
be coming next week I believe letting
things go is always weird and
uncomfortable and not easy so know that
you're allowed to go through steps 1 2 3
as many times as you need to before you
get to step 4 but trust me when you do
get to step 4 it is gonna feel amazing
you're gonna know that it was meant to
be it was meant to happen the way it did
and so either just got to be easy on
yourself and give yourself the space and
time to grow and to change and to shed
the skin okay that's kind of a gross
metaphor so I'm gonna stop saying that
now and let you guys go here I love you
guys too submitting back feel free to
leave a comment down below the things in
your life that you need to let go of or
if you're gonna go through any kind of
letting go ritual then definitely let me
know by tweeting instagramming it or
just again writing it in the comments
because I love kind of hearing whenever
I post a video how these things just
fall into all of us kind of doing this
like soul-searching stuff the same
I'm here I'm doing it with you and
hopefully we can all make it to step
four and bring some new things into our
lives and with that I will see all of
