know earlier this entire buddy was just
gonna be me trying to get the freaking
intro or starting
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video it is the second day
of Camus and I can't believe that
Christmas is literally two days away
that kind of like totally messes me up
being that Christmas is two days away
that also means that we're like less
than two weeks away from rolling into
the new year and I feel like this time
of year is always my favorite for that
reason I am that person that gets
obsessed with the new year sets a bunch
of resolutions tries to maintain them
usually fails we all do it it's all good
but I love any good excuse for a new
beginning a chance to set some goals get
some organization stuff done and
basically be the inner Monica Geller
that I am really quickly the guys aren't
following me already I have been posting
some new year's style hints there's a
bunch of new year stuff coming for my
channel and also just in general I'm so
definitely come check that out as well
as my blog great where Bentley is right
now I'm going to be posting at some New
Year's resolutions and goals and stuff
on there too so definitely check that
out and also if you're wondering is my
arm cold yeah yes it is still moving
forward if you guys want to know my
formula for living your best life in
2018 then just keep watching oh my god
another coffee talked into it I have
forgotten my coffee how many Fluffy's on
me how frigging beautiful look at that
steam else oh this is a mug that's gonna
be coming out on coos very soon yeah
that's that's a literally life in a
nutshell okay now we can begin so when
it comes to living your best life in
2018 I've broken it down into three
steps to make sure that you're not only
just moving forward into 2018 to live
your best life but also coming up with a
plan and learning from 2017 if it was a
bad year I might be one of those like
exceptions to the rule where I actually
really enjoyed 2017 based on what I've
read on Twitter a lot of people had a
lot of downfalls or really didn't like
2017 that said no matter if you think
you had a good year a bad year whatever
it is the first step when it comes to
living your best life following into the
new year is reflecting on the year that
just passed
how was 2017 like how was it really
think about where you were January 1st
2017 did you look different were you
acting different were you working
somewhere different
were you happier where you sadder was
there things going on then that you've
coped with were there things that you
didn't even know we're gonna happen
throughout the year yeah even if it
seems like not a lot has changed and
shifted a lot has don't just try and
focus on the things that you didn't like
about this year try and ask yourself the
things that you did like about this year
that way you're not kind of going into
2018 with a really sour perspective feel
like that's such a thing that we all
kind of joke about we're all like oh
this year's so going into 2018 with that
it's only going to breed more of that
negativity in the new year I think we
have to come to terms with 2017 before
we can even think about having a better
year in 2018 what did the bad things
that happened in 2017 teach you that you
can carry into 2018 this is like a
little mental trick where you take a
negative and somehow try and find the
positive pull it a journal pulled a
piece of paper or just sit and actually
truly take some time to reflect on 2017
on the good of 2017 and the bad of 2017
and not only that
ask yourself what was your role in it it
can be also really easy for us to look
at a year that maybe wasn't our favorite
and look at all the reasons why it
sucked
and not really take responsibility for
our own play in that we can also then
forgive ourselves for not doing the
things that we wanted to do in 2017 in
order to move on into 2018 and not carry
that resentment forgive the fact that
you didn't have the year you thought
you're going to slowly to be able to
move forward into 2018 and try better
without having that self-doubt or that
weight of self-loathing or blame on
yourself or on anybody else
so the first step when it comes to
living your best life next year is to
reflect on this year step number two
when it comes to living your best life
in 2018 is to plan and quite frankly my
favorite step in the whole process
once you've reflected and gotten all
that energy out of your system from 2017
it's time to start planning for 2018 and
this is where things get fun I know
there's a lot of people that bash
resolutions and say that it shouldn't
just be at the beginning of the year
type of thing but I also feel like the
new year just gives us like this
opportunity to do it and start fresh
with a clean slate and I think that's
why people enjoy it so much I personally
don't think it's overrated I think it's
what you make of it it all starts out
with three different categories your
goals your priorities
your habits first things first ask
yourself what kind of goals you want to
accomplish in 2018 one of my biggest
goals for 2018 is to release
dreamcatcher and feel like I really took
the time to do it the way I wanted to do
it and get it out in a physical form and
basically release my first actual book
other goals could be things like running
a marathon
it could be starting up a YouTube
channel it could be anything that is
detailed where you're like I want to do
this exact thing that is a goal the next
and quite frankly I would say more
important list to make for 2018 are your
priorities for the year when we set
goals when we set resolutions we tend to
get very lofty we tend to get very
excited and we tend to think that we
have maybe more time or more energy to
do all the things that we really want to
do and it sucks that we don't but this
is where your priority list comes into
effect because not only is your priority
list gonna help you keep on par with the
things that are more important versus
things that you can maybe let slide into
2019 or further your priority list is
also going to make sure that you're not
losing yourself in your goals we get so
hyper consumed with accomplishing these
crazy things and these crazy goals that
we forget to set priorities and keep the
most important things at the top of that
list like your family your friends the
people that are important to you your
health so that way when you're trying to
accomplish all of these crazy lofty
goals things are overlapping you're
running out of time and you don't know
which to give your all to you can check
your priority list and see what comes
first and you can put everything on that
priority list your priority list could
be a hundred items long and it could
start with friends and family and end
with things like posting to Instagram it
could even be that simple but making
sure that you have a priority list and
putting it in an order and to which what
is most important to you and to who you
are as a person to what is maybe not as
important but something you still enjoy
it makes us that when it comes down to
spending your time with a family member
who's only in town for a few days or
getting done this goal or this whatever
that you had plans like working out
maybe or whatever it is even if at the
end of the year you don't accomplish
everything you wanted to accomplish you
know you always had your priorities
straight and the reason why you probably
didn't get it all done
it's because you took the things that
were more important in life and put your
focus and your time and your energy
there then you can go out of the year
even having not accomplished maybe
everything you wanted to feeling good at
your core step number three is looking
at your goals and your priorities and
then asking yourself what types of
habits are you going to need to form in
order to keep yourself accountable and
on top of these things for the whole
year so for instance if you have a goal
to start living a healthier lifestyle
what type of habits are you going to
need to form in order to accomplish that
goal maybe you need to research meal
prepping maybe you'll need to start
looking into living like a vegan
lifestyle or maybe you want to start
running start going to yoga and then how
do you plan on forming them this is
where all the research and the
nitty-gritty details of your goals and
resolutions for the new year come into
play you want to write a book if you
want to start a YouTube channel if you
want to start learning an instrument if
you want to learn a new language if you
want to start a healthy lifestyle if you
were there soap if you want to travel
the world odds are you're gonna need to
research about it and then come up with
some sort of strategy or plan in order
to execute your goals and get them
accomplished at the beginning of the
year it's easy to jump up and be like
okay I'm going to the gym but once
February and March starts rolling around
do you have a back-up plan that's gonna
keep you you know accountable to these
goals it could be telling somebody about
it it could be setting reminders in your
phone it could be having a vision board
or a mood board if you spend a whole
month posting blog posts every other day
or YouTube videos once a week then maybe
at the end of the month you can invest
in a new camera or invest in a
microphone or invest in some lighting
because you're rewarding yourself for
taking initiative and sticking to the
goals and actually putting in the work
and then my last vital tip when it comes
to planning out 2018 this is gonna sound
super nerdy and weird but it works trust
me write yourself a letter dated
December 31st 2018 pick the top three
goals that you want to have accomplished
in 2018 and write out that you will or
you hope that you have accomplished
those by that day maybe some
perspectives that you hope you're still
holding on to or maybe some promises
that you want to make to yourself for
the end of the year so by December 31st
2018 who do you want to be and write to
that person promising that you're gonna
make sure that you get there that you
get to being that person by the end of
the year read it over a few times put it
in an envelope and seal it and I'm
saying like seal it so that you
cannot open it until December 31st 2018
and then leave that envelope somewhere
that you can see it every day whether
it's on your dresser want your desk in
your purse wherever you want to put it
but make sure that that letter is
something that you can see every day so
anytime throughout the year that letter
is a constant reminder of the promises
that you've made to yourself for that
year and how hard you're gonna try to
make sure that you become the person
that you told yourself you were gonna be
and just a quick note to keep in mind
when doing this it can be super easy to
not even realize that we're leaning more
into the superficial and followers I'm
gonna hate you that's where you got to
come back to your priority list and look
at your priorities look at your goals
and write a letter to yourself and ask
who do you want to be by that day that
is actually true to who your core is and
the best version of yourself that you're
striving to be and last but not least
when it comes to living your best life
in 2018 the final step is action
the thing about action is at the
beginning of the year it's easy to have
this burst of motivation and inspiration
but action is actually what creates
motivation and inspiration it's not
motivation and inspiration that creates
action we're lucky because when the New
Year rolls around it does come with a
bit of a sense of inspiration and
motivation because you feel like you
have this clean slate but as the year
starts to carry on keep this literally
chiseled into your brain action is what
breeds motivation which comes back to
action take the action and trust me the
mindset and the attitude will follow
another really important thing about
action is give yourself a motto for the
year a quick line a quick word something
that you can say to yourself and that's
gonna be the motto of 2018 so any single
time that you feel yourself slipping or
you don't want to take action you say
the motto to yourself and it gives you
that just tiny little bolt of energy
that it takes to just do it your motto
could be Hakuna Matata your motto could
be just do it like Nike there's so many
things that your motto could be if I can
think of more I'll put them into the
description box and if you guys have any
mottos to add definitely leave them in
the comments down below because I feel
like it'll just be like the most
motivating comment section of life but
come up with a little motto and live by
that motto for 2018 every single time
you take action every single time you go
a life for every single morning that you
wake up you can do all the reflecting
and planning in the world but the action
is where you actually show up for
yourself
is where you stop just sitting in your
comfort zone dreaming of the type of
life you want to live and actually just
start living it the final piece of
advice when it comes to living your best
life in 2018 is to remember that life is
what happens while you're busy making
other plans
left on 2017 plan out your year take
action but don't attach yourself or your
happiness too much onto an idea of what
you want 2018 to be instead let the year
unravel for you and take every moment an
opportunity that it gives you and just
do your best and make the best out of it
while also being kind and keeping your
intentions and your priorities in check
and with that we'll all be able to go
into the new year without attaching to
this idea or belief and instead allowing
ourselves to be happy no matter what
happens because we're in a line with who
we are to our core and making the best
of every single moment so this concludes
the formula / steps that I came up with
in order to live your best life in 2018
I hope you guys enjoy if you guys didn't
know this one of my other big goals for
2018 is actually to turn coffee talks
into a podcast so if you guys have any
podcast topics that you guys want me to
start working on also pop those down
below or feel free to tweet or Instagram
them at me you're still one more video
left in the 12 days of camus so I will
see you guys all tomorrow but with that
I still hope that you guys are all
having a happy and a safe holiday and
you know that you're feeling a little
humbled now by 2017 and not so defeated
by it because based on Twitter it feels
like everyone was feeling just a little
bit defeated now I'm gonna go change my
sweater because my left arm is very cold
