today I'm going to be talking to you
guys all about living your dream life if
you guys are following me already I'm
going to leave my Instagram and my
Twitter right on the screen here make it
nice and easy for you guys if you're on
a computer you can even click them right
away and it will take you right to there
I'm always posting like motivational
quotes on my Twitter and stuff like that
and also if you guys are new to my
channel then be sure to subscribe I
upload videos every Monday and every
Wednesday which is always fun because
it's double trouble if you're single
beep you know so without further adieu
and let's figure out how to live our
dream laughs so first and foremost
obviously every single person watching
this video everybody's going to have a
completely different dream life per se
so in order to establish the life that
you really want to live and chase your
dreams you kind of have to figure out
what those dreams are so my
recommendation for this is to make a
dream board I've talked to you guys
about dream boards before in the past
there's a bunch of different fun ways
you can do this it doesn't have to be
some like corny magazine clipart that
you would have made when you were like
you know twelve make it really cute you
can make it like it's decor for your
apartment your dorm your bedroom or the
other really cool thing about this too
is that this is completely up to you you
have full creative control for the
longest time when I go to make a dream
board it'd be like hey where do I want
to be in five years and I'm like I don't
know what I want to eat for dinner so
you can even make your dream board for a
year from now you can make it six months
from now I decided that I was going to
make my dream board for a year in
advance so then what I did is I went
online I found a bunch of pictures that
kind of coincided with a lot of the
things that are my dreams like you know
writing my book and getting it published
or moving to a big city or anything like
that and I printed off all of those
pictures I decided to print off all of
the pictures in black and white and put
them into a frame that was like a
Polaroid and I did this on PicMonkey and
then after printing them off I just put
them onto some cardstock with some tape
to laminate it and then used an exacto
knife to cut out each of the Polaroids
and then hang them on my wall and I just
thought this was such a cool way to kind
of display my dream board without it
kind of looking like you know like a
collage of just things from a magazine
this kind of looks like it's decor on my
wall but if you look closer the pictures
actually kind of resemble where I want
to be in one year wouldn't believe
the kind of results you can get by
waking up looking at your dream board
every day and just kind of like centers
your headspace every single day is going
to be different we're not always going
to be you know on our a-game in terms of
charging full force at life but having a
dream board to like check in on every
night every day or whenever you're in a
really bad mood or something terrible
just happens or doesn't go your way you
can look at your dream board and just
recenter yourself so step number two is
to do what your research this doesn't
sound fun but again it can be assumed
establish what your dreams are you're
going to need to do the research now to
actually back that stuff up so it could
be your dream to write a book but you
kind of have to do the research to find
out how to write a book or you know what
take classes or do whatever you have to
do to be fully equipped and gain full
knowledge in terms of what your dreams
are and if you want to make it fun you
know light up some candles bring
yourself some tea sit down with your
laptop blares some tune and just
completely Zen out researching all of
the stuff that inspires you so step
number three is going to be make big
plans so for me it was I kept on
dreaming about moving out of my hometown
and moving to a city but all I did was
talk about it and I ended up staying
another year and all of these things and
it was almost like I was waiting for the
perfect moment or the perfect time or I
just kept on visualizing me living in
the Toronto or wherever but I wasn't
actually doing it like I wasn't actually
planning for it I was just visualizing
it if there's something you want to do
figure out what you have to do to get
there and it could be something five
years from now even but you're still
gonna have to make some sort of plan to
get to where you want to be even if
something on your dream board is as
small as you know being fit and healthy
what are you going to do to be fit and
healthy how you going to get there
there's that really really funny cliche
how does it go again it's like fail to
plan then plan to fail I think that's
how it goes I may have just butchered
that the step number four is to start
acting accordingly I think I've talked
to you guys about the book you are about
as before by jeomsun chair oh I listened
to her audiobook probably once a month
just to always refresh it so that it's
constantly the forefront of my mind it's
very positive thinking and things like
that and something that she says in the
book is to act as if it's already yours
you've established where you want to be
you've established what your dream line
if you start acting as if it's already
promised to you not in like an arrogant
stuck-up or narcissistic way but act as
if your fate has already been written oh
and that is what's going to happen to
you then you're going to start aligning
a lot of your emotions a lot of your
actions a lot of your mindsets headspace
the energy you give off to people it's
going to start aligning with where you
want to be hopefully that makes sense to
you guys but yeah just start acting as
if it's already promised to you so tip
number five is kind of like a double tip
it's a to start loving yourself and be
work before you already have what I'm
getting at with this is don't be like
okay I'm going to be happy when I get my
dream life you have to learn to be happy
with what you already have and love
yourself the way you already are it
stopped doing things that self-sabotage
off doing things that don't make you
feel good about yourself if in your
dream life you picture yourself having
this like elaborate amazing house you
might not have that house yet but what
you do have is your bedroom or your
apartment or whatever it is
spruce it up a bit start doing little
tiny things that kind of make you feel
like what you have now is already
aligning with what you want later so
yeah be patient with yourself take care
of yourself and just start working with
what's in front of you right now so step
number six and this is a really really
important one and I'm telling you this
one from experience joy you know step A
to B to C all the way to Z where you get
to whatever your dream life is for me I
always wanted to do YouTube it was a
always a huge huge hobby of mine I was
so passionate about oh so into it but I
swear to God if you would have told me I
would have been here at 22 in a solo
apartment with my little puppy and you
know filming videos for you guys every
day if you want to told me that that was
going to happen
looking back now I almost kind of wish
that I had enjoyed the journey a little
bit more along the way like it's so fun
and it's so important to be driven and
focused and to work hard at what you
want and getting where you want to be
but as all of this is happening you know
your family is getting older and you're
getting older and everything that's
happening around you you don't take it
for granted enjoy all of the steps in
between and the last and final tip is to
go for it not going to get to where you
want to go if you go at it half-ass
maybe tomorrow or maybe next
maybe next year you're constantly afraid
of what people are going to think of you
if you are afraid that you're going to
fail if you're afraid that you're not
going to get what you really want if you
don't think you're worthy enough for it
or if you don't wake up and want to work
hard to get to where you want to go any
person that's living the life that they
really want odds are that they have to
work their butts off to get there it's a
harsh reality to realize that if you
want something nobody's going to get it
for you and there are no shortcuts and
even if there are shortcuts and you take
them it's never going to feel as good as
if you really put in the work and effort
to get to where you want to go and
sometimes our biggest obstacle is maybe
the way we see ourselves maybe we think
we're not worth our dream life or maybe
we think we're not good enough we're not
as cool as that person that lives the
life that we really want we're not as
important or we don't have you know the
means or the necessities to get to that
life but that's just creating excuses so
if you want it enough and you want to
live that kind of life then tell
yourself that you're worth it you do
deserve it and I mean what's the point
if you go through your whole life
getting to the very end and then
realizing that you only got one ride you
didn't you know use it to its full
potential because you gave yourself
excuses for why things couldn't happen
instead of giving yourself reasons to go
for it if there's no point in going for
it if you're not going to go balls to
the walls it's a really gross term but
it's like my favorite thing to say it
okay just buddy really have four vacuum
with the hallway while I film so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and that you
took something away from it don't let
anything or anyone ever stop you or make
you feel silly or ridiculous for living
the life that you want to live there is
enough success to go around for every
single one of us there is enough pie for
everybody sit here and continue to list
off cliches for you guys but I'll keep
it at that let me know down below I'm
very curious as to what your guys's
dream lies are leave your comments in
the comment section and if you guys
decide to do with the little dream board
DIY then be sure to tweet or Instagram
them at me so that I can like and
favorite and all of that fun stuff and
then that I will see you guys all in a
future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
