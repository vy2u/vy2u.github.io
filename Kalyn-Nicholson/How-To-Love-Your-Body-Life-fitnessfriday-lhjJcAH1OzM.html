the LA area
I'm leaving for LA on Tuesday but on
Saturday the 26th I believe it is I am
hoping to do a meet up even if it's only
two three girls whoever comes we're
going to grab lunch or go shopping or
whatever we plan on doing that day but
we're all going to hang out so any of
you that are in the LA area be sure to
follow me on Twitter or Instagram or
email me saying that you're interested
in coming so I can give you guys the
details but I will upload a future video
next week give you guys more details um
sorry about the lighting it's nighttime
here and I'm filming this pretty last
minute because I was at a cottage today
and then when I came back I was feeling
really really sick so I wasn't even sure
if I was gonna get a fitness Friday
up but I've decided to grab a cup of
coffee and just deal with it so don't
mind if I'm drinking my coffee and
talking to you guys and Bentley is
creeping on us in the background so it's
just what it is you know alright guys so
for today's video I really want to touch
on the subject of how to learn to love
your body it love yourself and love your
life so that is like a very broad kind
of spectrum of things that we could talk
about there but I'm just going to tell
you guys what it is that I find has
helped me not delusional in the fact
that I understand that everyone has bad
days I have bad days I have days where
you know you kind of are harder on
yourself than other days where you you
notice your imperfections more where you
feel like you look bad and just I like
every girl everybody has all of us have
those days like when you are dragging
yourself down it is so horrible I read a
quote actually and I favorited it or
hearted it on We Heart It because I saw
it I thought it would be perfect for
this video the quote was by JK Rowling
and it is thoughts could leave deeper
scarring than almost anything else and
this is so true I am such a strong
believer that our perspective on life
and how we remain positive or if we want
to be negative and all of that sort like
the way that you think I feel like it
has a direct reflection on our life and
how things can turn out for us
my sister actually gets really mad at me
because I always say this quote to her
if we're talking
like we had this mess up hoppin where we
were booking hotels for LA and it was a
big screw-up with hot wire do not book
with hot wire by the way do not book
with hot wire but anyway se ended up
charging her and we hadn't booked
anything long story short she was like
I'm convinced I'm just not going to get
the money back and I was like don't put
those thoughts into the universe and I
always say that she gets so much like
what is with you and that saying but it
is so true I read it actually I kind of
got that from the the secret when I had
read the secret or part of the secret it
was basically just saying like when you
put those negative thoughts out into the
universe you have instantly created a
negative rebound for yourself so if you
always try and remain positive and I
mean this isn't going to 100% work all
the time but if you try your best to
remain positive then life will happen
and things will just be positive for you
and you'll start to realize that if you
try and see the good in everything then
you'll more good things are going to
come your way and the law of attraction
sorry where it's just if you stay
positive and you put happy positive
thoughts up into the universe then
positivity will come back your way and I
promise you this by the way guys not
really going in any order for this I'm
just kind of rambling with you guys
because I feel like it makes the video a
little bit more rustic and not so
scripted to go off of like point forms
so I am kind of rambling so I hope you
guys are sticking with me on this so one
thing I really want to UM share with you
guys is something that I have myself
found I've learned more so in the past a
little bit so as you guys all know I
keep a journal and I actually write my
journal pretty much every single day
sometimes twice a day and sometimes I
miss a day but there's literally so many
entries into this journal since 2011 the
2012 actually and I had journals prior
to this but I've noticed reading back on
my entries that something I've learned
to do in the past year I would say more
so or even the past six months more so
than I ever have before is to learn to
how grateful and blessed our lives are
and I feel like I write that a lot more
than I ever used to and the way I want
you guys to see that is okay so there's
probably something that's going to pop
up into your brain when I say that we
all have something about ourselves that
we don't like we either
don't like our teeth or we don't like
our nose or we don't like a freckle on
our face or maybe like maybe we don't
like the way our bodies look our body
composition or our body fat percentage
there's so many different things that
were so hard on ourselves for and when
it boils down to it I mean everybody's
gonna have something that they that they
just don't like about themselves it's
just unsaddle a it's just kind of part
of human nature but literally I have sat
before and I mean I used to tear myself
apart like every normal like every other
girl usually does we've all had our days
where we rip ourselves to shreds and
then you literally sometimes you have to
kind of sit back and realize like do I
have two hands do I have two arms do I
have two legs am i breathing right now
am i healthy am I here and in this
moment right now I'm alive like I it's
so mind-blowing when you think of it
that way that we're sitting here judging
and ripping ourselves apart on the
tiniest little things when there's
people out there that I mean maybe can't
walk anymore and would just give
anything to be able to walk and we're
sitting here talking about how we hate
our legs because our thighs we don't
like our thighs like it's just stuff
like that it makes you kind of rethink
kind of over obsessing over those little
things and really understand how lucky
we are and I just feel like we can
sometimes take so much for granted and
overlooked so many things and obsess
over some of the tiniest things in life
and stop seeing like the bigger picture
and the greater picture and I find that
especially because growing up as a girl
and being a teenage girl and now that
I'm a young adolescent I know very well
how high standards can be for us and how
hard we can be on ourselves and how the
media and just everyone around us makes
us like we'll take any chance to make us
feel incompetent or negative or about
ourselves so that we want to go buy
their product or we want to go do this
and and put money towards that industry
so that we can feel as pretty as these
people that they're pushing in our face
when in all reality they are all
photoshopped and they are perfected
nobody on this earth is perf
affect everybody's definition of perfect
is different so how can there even be
such thing as perfect like it's just we
need to stop holding ourselves to these
super high standards that the people who
are setting these standards like
literally they don't even look like that
like I'm telling you right now the
person who invented Victoria's Secret
probably did not look like a Victoria's
Secret Angel so why like and even the
Victoria's Secret Angels don't even look
like that like when you watch the
Victoria's Secret um runway and you
watch how they prep for that that show
the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show like
what I remember watching one of them
even say like I don't even look like
this every day it's because they'd eat
they have to start a dehydration for the
runway they start to slower their
calories and they start to get spray
tans and they're like they have
professionals working on their makeup in
their hair and then we're all sitting
here like oh I want to look like that I
bet she wakes up looking like that
nobody wakes up looking like that
literally and if you do well props to
you but I'm pretty sure nobody wakes up
looking like that so I think it's just
so important to realize that we don't
have to hold ourselves to those
standards and everybody's different and
the things that you may not like about
yourself your imperfections I read in an
article recently and I really really
liked the idea of this thought that our
imperfections are what make us uniquely
us so let's say the fact that in
pictures some pictures one of my eyes
goes more clothes than the other one and
it used to drive me crazy until I
realized that that's what makes me me
that's what makes me unique from other
people and and all that stuff I have a
scar on my forehead from when I had the
chickenpox when I was younger and it's
like a circle scar and that's what makes
me uniquely me and all the things that
you guys may not like about yourself
that's what makes you uniquely you and
as much as it may make us feel like we
may obsess over it you should learn to
embrace those things because nobody else
has those things that's what makes you
who you are there's a much bigger
picture to life and it's so easy to get
caught up into the tiny little things in
the day-to-day and obsess over all these
things and beat ourselves down and make
you'll make ourselves feel like we
aren't good enough and I feel like
there's already so many people out there
in the world that are trying to make us
feel like we aren't good enough that we
should not do it to ourselves that we
should make ourselves feel better and
not only that we should band up into a
team and make each other feel better I
can't generalize but I just feel like a
lot of females or a lot of girls are so
quick to bash each other and break each
other down because to see someone else
fail makes you feel a little bit better
and I feel like it's kind of sad in the
sense that I want
I wish girls would kind of team up
together more so and make each other
feel better about themselves and not
kind of poke out their imperfections and
instead be like wow that girl's really
good at whatever it is she's doing and
that's really awesome like but that's
that's her and this is me and someone
else being good at something or someone
else doing something or someone else
looking a certain way doesn't take away
from what you have and what you do and
who you are and it shouldn't take away
from that you should realize that
everyone's on their own journey in their
own path and everyone is their own
person and just because one person does
one thing or one person looks one way
doesn't mean that it makes you any less
of a person or any less of who you are
or what you're good at or the things you
are amazing at and the things you can do
so for those of you that are really
struggling with you know being happy and
just loving life loving who you are and
your body and how you look I highly
highly recommend you guys make a journal
I did make a DIY journal video so you
guys can spice up your journal and make
it look all cute but even if you're not
going to write like how you're feeling
every single day I highly recommend at
least at the end of every single day
write down three things you're grateful
for or three things you are happy that
you did that day or find three good
things about that day or three good
things about life or anything like that
and honestly you will start to realize
that your perspective on life will start
to change and you'll start to kind of
because you're training your mind to
start thinking those things daily it'll
just happen more more often and you'll
start to realize the bigger picture of
life and you'll stop having such a
negative
um a negative outlook on everything that
happens to you and everything that's
going on and you'll start to realize
that there's always something to be
thankful for there's always something to
be positive about and there's always not
every day is going to be good but
there's always going to be something
good in every single day and there's
literally nothing wrong with feeling a
little bit bad about yourself sometimes
all of us do I still do but it's so
important to realize that you should
love yourself for who you are and you
should embrace who you are and that you
should be thankful for who you are
because if you're not going to cherish
yourself who else will my coffee is
getting cold so I hope this video made
sense I feel like I was kind of all over
the place but I kind of like these
videos where I can sit down and just
kind of let my mind flow and just say
what's coming up because it's a little
less it's like less scripted I don't
know I just feel like it's more real
like I'm actually having a conversation
with you guys I really hope you guys
