it's messing me up in all the best wings
so much like comes latest you lose me
and listen to this beautiful majestic
crap welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm doing another video in
the adulting 101 series because it has
been so tightly requested this main
video I'm going to be talking all about
how to break bad habit I myself recently
I would say over the last three months
have actually nixed and quit so many bad
habits that I had and not that I was
like terrible or anything but there were
so many habits that I really wanted to
change and so I told like I kind of went
through these certain steps in order to
change them or get rid of them or
replace them with better habits and be a
happier and healthier person and with
doing that I was actually shocked by how
much I stuck to it and how much my whole
lifestyle and my whole perspective on a
lot of things started to change
throughout that time I decided to
compile a little list of things that I
found helps me quit all of my bad habits
which reminds me one of the things that
I don't have to this coffee table is a
coffee because I won quit caffeine and -
I do drink decaf but I already have a
onesy top of the day so like I said
we're not going to give in to those
habits that I had before today I want to
know all of my steps when it comes to
breaking it bad habits then just keep
watching ok so tip number one is
obviously to identify the habits that
you want to break I kept on falling into
these pits of being unmotivated
uninspired depress down low and just
feeling like I've had no zest or thread
towards life and I would constantly be
down on myself I would be super negative
but my self-talk was very negative it
got so bad that at point I had to just
sit down and brainstorm what it was that
was causing so much toxic turmoil in my
life and for me to feel the way that I
was feeling because I knew that my life
is great I knew that I was surrounded by
so many things I'm grateful for and I
just felt like there was some sort of
roadblock and between me and feeling
happier when I started to notice there's
a lot of the things that I was writing
down I would look at that would be like
even though I get some sort of
satisfaction out of this I know that
this is bad for me or even though I know
this should bring me a sense of
happiness I'm not doing it because I'm
lazy or I'm unmotivated
so I basically identified a bunch of
habit even though they were bringing me
short-term happiness in the long term it
wasn't going to make me happy or
routines and things that I wish I was
doing there's a person that I kind of
wish I was and could very well be but I
wasn't letting myself be that person so
an example of that would be like I fell
off working out for a while and I
remember thinking that's not who I am I
love having the habit of working out
because it makes me feel good but I'm
not letting myself be that person I was
staying up really late and I was doing
things like tiny little habits that I
knew were detrimental to my overall
happiness but brought me a sense of joy
or comfort in that moment a good way to
do this is to take a piece of paper take
a journal and just start writing down
behaviors or habits that you have
despite whether they're good or bad and
then she does good look at them start
identifying the good behaviors and
habits versus the bad behaviors and
habits and that will be an easy way for
you to notice okay these are the habits
that I want to change so yeah number one
the most important obviously is you
can't change a habit until you identify
step number two and this can be a harder
step is to identify why and when when
does this have it start in your life was
it years ago months ago weeks ago at
what point in your life did this start
to become a habit for you and then ask
yourself why did it become a habit
because no matter what how this we have
whether they're good or bad they give us
some sort of gratification whether we're
seeking comfort whether we're seeking
escape everything we do we have a reason
for it so we have to determine the why
when it comes to the habits that we have
a lot of the times our habits can stem
from stress and boredom you're bored you
might start creating some bad habits in
order to fulfill your boredom or what's
worse and a harder one to deal with is
stress and I find for me a lot of my
habits formed from stress like whenever
I felt anxious or stressed out I would
or to binge eat shops and drop money
that I on aimless stupid things just to
fulfill a sense of comfort foods on the
way like that's going to bring me
comfort I'm not going to do any of my
responsibilities today because I'm too
stressed out and so that was where
habits started to form for me with the
stress and this can go a lot deeper when
you're looking at the why stress might
just be like I was feeling a little bit
stressed out from one thing but when you
really dig down deep it goes all the way
back to family situations circumstances
surrounding our reality they can get
pretty deep when you start to look at
your reasoning for bad habits and where
they come from and why they happen
definitely take a good chunk of time to
kind of think about that if you don't
establish your right is that we we do
these bad habits then you're not going
to be able to fix them because the Y is
super important along with the when
you're struggling to figure out why a
lot of times when we look at when they
began that can also be a very good
indicator of what was going on around
that time that created those bad habits
except number three is another why
and another identification and it is to
identify why you want to change it I
mean a lot of the times it's super easy
like I want to be a healthier person or
I want to be a happier person
but the more details you get about this
the easier it's going to be for you to
stick to your habit and example for me
is I really wanted to put my habit of
overspending when I felt stressed out or
like stress shopping after I figured it
when it started and why I did it
I also need to identify why I didn't
want to do it anymore
and this why is what kept me from going
back to that bad habit so what I wrote
down that I have a goal that I want to
buy property or I want to own land or
things like that if that became my why
it was I don't want to spend stupid
money on something that's only going to
bring me a short sense of comfort I want
a long term comfort I want to know and
feel mature for spending my money wisely
and for you know dealing with my stress
in a better way and those things became
my why and writing that down
anytime you feel like you're going to
fall back into that bad habit look at it
and remind yourself why it is you don't
want to go back to that bad
and they don't even have to be big like
detrimental habits either it can easily
be like I want to start going to bed
earlier and your reason why I can be I
don't want to feel tired through the day
tomorrow I want to be more well rested I
want to take better care of my body I
want to give myself that time to relax
and recoup I want to be less stressed
then go from very small to that habit to
very big bad habit that's number four is
you can't get rid of a habit without
replacing the habit so let's say for
instance you wanted to quit smoking you
don't have to replace your watch or your
need or the time you would spend smoking
with something else so if you smoke and
you know the reason why you smoke is
because you're stressed then you need to
find something else that can help with
your stress and give you that same sort
of gratification you get from smoking or
eating habits is a good example too you
know
for me when I would get really really
stressed out I would order in food or I
would make myself like a disgusting
amount of comfort food and I was easel
when I looked at that habit where like I
would overeat or order in food or just
kind of gave into this like bad habit
even when I wasn't hungry what was I
actually looking for and for me I was
looking for a sense of relief or comfort
from my stress so I had to find
something else I could do whenever I
felt stressed and needed a relief or
excessive comfort instead of just
ordering food or eating and disgusting
amount of food and so anytime I got
anxious or stressed out of astromech
headphones in and I would draw something
instead I saw the first few times you do
this and you replace your bad habits
with good ones it's not going to be that
easy you're still going to be tempted to
give in to that bad habit but like I
said this when you go back to your Y
basically what I'm saying is you need to
replace your bad habit with a good habit
that gives you the same benefit or
gratification that your old habit used
to give you the tip number five is stop
enabling yourself you need to get rid of
all the things that cause you to create
the habits that you do I wanted to start
waking up earlier and having with this
whole morning routine and is this been
one of the best decisions I've ever made
I mean I've never been one that slept in
very late but I knew that every time I
ever force myself to wake up at 6:15 in
the morning or 6:00 a.m. in the morning
brought this sense of like joy in Mia
that I always wanted to feel and I feel
like
standing in my way from getting that
sense of joy so instead of enabling
myself by keeping my phone beside my bed
I started putting my phone on the other
side of the room which forced me to get
up and out of bed and turn off my alarm
every morning get rid of the junk food
in your house stop going to the bars if
you're trying to not drink as much stop
going to the mall if you keep spending
and this might even go as deep is
surrounding yourself with different
people the people you're around tend to
enable you or trigger you to kind of
create bad habits that they may also
have it might be a smart idea to either
join together join forces and you know
not do those habits together or start
hanging out with people that kind of
have the lifestyle or build a habit that
you're looking to seek hang out with
people that exercise or less to you know
get out there and be active if you're
looking to be a more active person we
need to get rid of the things that
enable us and kind of trigger the bad
habits to happen and in all we kind of
need to change our lifestyle if we're
really looking to change our habits
which leads me to tip number six and it
is to tell somebody the habits that
you're looking to change I don't think I
would have been able to change half the
habits that I worked on it's not all of
them if I didn't tell like Greg if I
didn't tell my sister if I didn't tell
my friend when I was putting caffeine I
remember everybody being like what do
you do at Kaylin quitting caffeine does
not make sense and I remember so many
people being like are you sure you're
going to be able to do that I know I
will because one you've dealt with me
and - I've told you so now I fail you're
going to know that I fail and not only
that kept me so on par with not drinking
coffee and it was something that helped
me so much and hey if you don't have
that leave a comment down below tell me
in the comment section that house that
you're planning on breaking after this
video and honestly I will answer back
you I will come back and make sure that
you guys are holding to it like if I
don't ask me right away I'm going to be
answering you within this week and so I
want to know what habits you're breaking
tweet it to me and keep me posted come
back and continue to write in the and
the little you know what is that thing
called the tree of comments that we'll
have back and forth tip number seven
anytime you can visualize your success
when I went to bed at night I always
kind of picture my day tomorrow picture
myself waking up nice and early
picturing myself super happy at the Sun
in the morning before a lot of people
are even awake from me such a sense of
joy and fulfillment
when my alarm went off in the morning
that was kind of the last thought I had
was going to bed so I would get up and
all of the suddens that kind of thought
became my reality even making things
like a dream board or writing down your
goals on a daily basis every morning sit
down and write down you know how your
perfect day would go or write down all
of the things that you're looking to
accomplish and pictures a success you
feel picture like try and feel it in
your bones like this it's already been
given to you were already going promise
to you think of all of the things that
will come with that habit like if it's
working out that you want to start doing
or eating healthy picture yourself in a
to three months from now picture how you
feel how you'll look like how fulfilled
you're going to be and think of all the
things that are going to come your way
if you stick to this habit even making
this a habit visualizing your success
it's honestly going to be one of the
most beneficial things in your life
despite whether you're doing it for
habits or despite whether you're doing
it for goal setting despite whether
you're doing it for your dreams and
ambitions later on in life this is like
a form of meditation that I'm not
kidding you will not only bring you such
a sense of excitement for life and
excitement for all the things you're
doing but it'll also honestly it works
in the sense of the law of attraction
it'll start to also gravitate those
things to you faster you kind of
visualize an action and a reaction it
causes your brain that when you end up
doing that action it already has
envisioned a reaction to if you're more
prone to go to that reaction so for
instance if I picture myself waking up
in the morning and being like oh I
really don't want to wake up that's
going to suck I'm going to be so tired
I'm going to be so unhappy odds are when
I wake up in the morning I'm going to
think it sucks I'm going to be so tired
I'm going to be so unhappy versus if I'm
going to bed thinking I'm going to wake
up tomorrow I'm going to be so happy and
I'm going to you know put on some good
music I'm going to light candles and
it's going to feel so good when I wake
up in the morning I'm going to get up
all of a sudden I'm going to feel a
little happy I'm going to start lighting
the candles I'm going to start playing
music and it's automatically my brain is
there because I created that pathway for
it to connect my action to my reaction
this type of visualizations will change
a life just do it tip number eight and I
kind of touched on this a lot already in
this video is to think long term versus
short term when I read the books the
subtle art of not getting the
excuse my language there
this huge chunk that has always stuck
with me and it was such an aha moment
and it was short-term gratification
versus long-term gratification and this
is huge when it comes to habit forming
we're going to get that short-term
gratification from abandoning
responsibilities bringing us a sense of
comfort now versus later bringing us a
sense of enjoyment now versus later
instead of actually the long term
gratification we're okay if I sweep in
and I skip my workout and I eat like
crap all day and I just watch Netflix
and I don't go to work all of those
things in the moment might feel good but
odds are a week of that two weeks of
that three weeks of that you're going to
start feeling depressed you're going to
start feeling unmotivated you're going
to find yourself in a rut and you're
going to feel that you have no sense of
self-worth because you've been treating
yourself like crap so start thinking
about the long term gratification you
want is it saving money for something in
the future is it adopting the type of
lifestyle or the type of characteristics
of somebody you think is super
motivational we have to think of that
instead of thinking of the comfort
you're going to feel right in this
moment by giving into your bad habit
when we do things that bring us a longer
sense of gratification versus a shorter
sense of gratification we retrain our
brains to understanding that you know it
might be a little uncomfortable for me
to get up early it might be a little
uncomfortable for me to go work out
because I really don't want to put my
body through that might be a little
uncomfortable for me to eat the potatoes
and the salad of the corn instead of
ordering a vegan pizza but I know it's
going to make me feel so much better in
the long run and eventually these things
will start to be things that I crave
because that longer term gratification
will start to feel so much better than
the shorter term gratification but I'll
never want to screw with short-term
gratification again and last but not
least make a plan so now that we've gone
through all of those steps and we
understand why and how and when and what
and all of the W's that come with
quitting bad habits and starting new
ones we need to make some sort of plan
so for me I am like a numbers person I
need to have a visualization I need to
have a beginning and an end I need to be
able to see where I want to be by a
certain time at sixty day no coffee
challenge a 30-day a Whole Foods
challenge like a whole week of not
spending more than a certain amount of
money and doing things like that create
these little challenges for yourself
that sets you up for success because
when you fail the plan you can plan to
fail such a cliche quote but I have to
throw it in here because it's so true
and this is actually going to become a
theme on my channel because I have
written down a whole page of challenges
like good habit or healthy habit
challenges and I'm going to start doing
them blog style if you guys is going to
be a series that's going to be coming up
to my channel but doing that and I'll be
doing it with you guys like tell me some
challenges you want down below because I
can totally fulfill them well we can do
them together so coming up with that
kind of plan is going to help you start
to adopt these habits in a way that
gives you a sense of gratification and
like accomplishment pick a start date
pick an end date get a detailed as
possible write it all down put it up on
a whiteboard put it up on your wall it
feels so good in your phone that you'll
never want to stop so I hope you guys
enjoyed this coffee talk let me know
down below what you think or let me know

breaking and what you plan on replacing
