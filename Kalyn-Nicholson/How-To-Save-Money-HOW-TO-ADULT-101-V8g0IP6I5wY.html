Oreos hey guys so for today's video as
you probably already know from the title
I am fulfilling many many requests to
make the how to adult video a series so
this is going to be episode 2 and the
how to adult and this is all about
saving money first and foremost if you
guys aren't following me on Instagram
and Twitter be sure to go ahead and do
that I've officially changed my
Instagram theme for fall I'm so excited
about it guys I guess so dorky about
this stuff is my theme on Instagram has
been the same all summer so just dorky
Instagram things you know from the most
basic personal life yeah other than that
let's jump in because I have 11 tips for
you guys today all about Savin the Cash
Money flow so first and foremost when it
comes to saving money one of the most
important things you can do is record
your expenses and this is something I am
so guilty for not doing it can be so
easy to just spend money aimlessly all
the time and when you're constantly
doing that and you're never actually
keeping record of every single time you
spend any money it's kind of like out of
sight out of mind a really easy way to
do this is if you have a day planner or
an agenda or even just like your journal
or a notebook for like day-to-day living
just record it every time you buy
something just really really quickly and
if you don't have any of those things
you can also just use your phone make a
note on your phone strictly for months
to months expenses so the beginning of
September log it into like September
2016 expenses and every time you buy
anything give yourself a quick reminder
to jump on your phone go to that note
and just write down what you buy it can
be something as small as going to the
dollar store for something or a mini
shopping spree or groceries just start
logging all of your expenses is super
key to because at the end of the month
you can add up all of your expenses and
see how much money you're really
spending most a month and where it's all
going once you know where your money is
where you're spending it and how you're
spending it and how frequently you're
spending it it's going to give you a
starting point in terms of okay this is
what I'm dealing with these are my
habits now where do I go from here which
leads me to point number two which is to
make yourself a budget this is something
you can do before you even find out
you're a whole month of expenses
sooner you started the more money you're
gonna be savings aren't by how much you
have to spend every month this is things
like your cell phone bill your rent car
gas groceries anything that you know
it's like I have to pay this right those
all down first and see how much money
you have left over what you have left
over after you expense out of everything
that is a necessity this is where you
can start having fun with your money
start to navigate okay how much do I
want to spend on recreational use how
much do I want to spend on going for
dinners or drinks or to the movies
set aside how much you want to put into
a savings account or like an RRSP
encounter this is like the smartest
thing you can do and the earlier you do
it and the more you stick to it the
better if you set aside okay this is how
much money I want to spend every week
for groceries and it's only like 40
bucks like that doesn't sound like a lot
of money but you can start finding ways
and tips and hacks and little shortcuts
you can make at the grocery store to
save that little bit of money and put it
towards something you're saving up for
or maybe just a savings account in
general for when you're older or even
just to spend a little bit more extra
money on yourself if you find you don't
have any money to do that at the end of
the day tip number three is to find
lifestyle shortcuts so for me I'm
somebody that drinks coffee every single
day that adds up so quickly if you're
somebody that doesn't cook food or
drinks a lot of coffee like goes out and
buys coffee even just for McDonald's
where it's super cheap you're still
gonna save so much more money if you
start making coffee at home you're gonna
save so much more money if you make food
at home if you start meal prepping your
meals or instead of going out with your
friends all the time invite them over to
your place and all of you go in on a big
bottle of wine which is again going to
save you so much money take a look at
your lifestyle and find where you can
make some super simple shortcuts that
aren't gonna take you that much more
effort but they're gonna save you so
much more money tip number four is to
only buy what you need now we all like
to buy what we want you even when you go
to the grocery store you're like I want
the Oreos I don't need the Oreos but I
want the Oreos so if you start getting
into the habits of only really buying
what you need it's going to save you so
much more money in the longer don't just
walk into the grocery store without a
shopping list and without a plan
and just throw into stuff in your cart
get home half of it rots in your fridge
you don't even end up using
they know what you need especially in
terms of going to the grocery store or
if you're going like back to school like
clothing shopping go take a look at your
closet and be like what do I actually
need versus what I want you get that
gratification of self reward for like a
couple minutes but then it's on to
wanting something else so if you just
get through that habit of only buying
what you need you are going to need to
cut so much extra expenses out of what
you're buying all the time tip number
five is something that you're gonna want
to do in terms of buying anything that's
like unrelated like anything that you
want and don't necessarily need for
example a really good tip is if you are
someone that likes to online shop or
even if you just go to the mall and you
see like candles or something that you
really really want and you're like do I
deserve this I feel like I do but I'm
not sure in a really good tip you can
use where you wait 48 hours so go back
home sleep on it
sleep on it again and if you still
really feel like you want it you still
really feel like you deserve it then go
back to the mall buy the candles or go
back online and hit check it a lot of
the times they're gonna realize like two
days later you don't really want it as
much anymore or you realize that it
would have been kind of stupid to spend
the $60 on candles and it cuts down so
much on the impulse buying and I am an
impulse shopper so when you wait 48
hours odds are you're not gonna spend as
much money on all of these things that
you think you want at the moment tip
number six is to leave your credit card
at home if you don't bring your credit
card with you everywhere there is not
that urge if you leave it at home and
there's no like temptation to just use
it to buy your friends rounds of drinks
or you're up shopping and you're like
whatever I'll just you know throw it on
the credit card grab a couple things
that I really really want so leaving
your credit card at home keeping it in a
safe place mind you but leaving it at
home is going to help cut back on how
much you're you're relying or falling
back on your credit card to buy things
that you really shouldn't be buying tip
number seven and this is a huge one for
me
is to avoid stress spending when I get
stressed out I do not eat my feelings I
shop my feelings so when I'm in a sad
mood a bad mood a down mood and
uninspired mood and unmotivated mood I
tend to somehow start surfing the
internet I end up on like we hearted
I ended up seeing a really cute outfit I
end up
googling that outfit I end up on some
like shopping website or Charlotte Russe
or whatever trying to find a duplicate
of what I just saw that my shopping bag
grows I get giddy I get so excited
so find other ways to kind of release
that stress and emotion that doesn't
involve spending money this can be
something as simple as doing like a free
yoga video at home right on YouTube
meditating going for a walk you know
going to the gym talking to a friend do
something or find something that's
better for you than stress spending tip
number eight is to cancel memberships
and things that you don't use like
subscriptions and this might sound like
so obvious but it's actually really
funny I went through my credit-card
statements recently and noticed that I
was paying for both Spotify and Apple
music and I had like a magazine thing on
there that I wasn't even really using
anymore and just so many random things
that I'm like if these end up adding up
every month and you don't notice it but
you're paying it off and then you're
realizing that you're not even using all
these things I was like Spotify or Apple
music Spotify cancel Apple music do I
like this magazine subscription no
cancel it do I use the gym membership
yes keep it go through all your months
month expenses and subscriptions look at
it be like how much do I actually use it
am I getting nine dollars worth out of
my Netflix however much money out of my
gym membership magazines music all of
that stuff and then if you're not
getting like the full value out of it
just canceling tip number nine is to
take a Sunday or any day that you have
off any afternoon and declutter your
whole space your bedroom your apartment
your wherever your living space is
declutter when you declutter all of the
stuff that's all around you and your
closets and your cabinets and everything
you start to find things that you don't
even remember buying or having I found
cleaning supplies I found clothes that I
didn't even know that I had anymore and
just so many things are it's like wow I
would have went out and bought more
paper towel or bought more cleaning
supplies or bought a shirt very similar
to this without even knowing that I
actually already had it back at home
keep everything clean neat and tidy and
everything around you has a place you're
going to always constantly be aware of
what you actually already have at home
so you're gonna know that you don't need
to buy another great t-shirt because you
already have four
or you don't need to buy more Windex
because you got two bottles at home
number ten is very suitable because it's
give yourself a ten second rule and this
is when you're going to buy anything
whether it's groceries whether it's your
movies whether you're buying something
online no matter what you're about to
spend money on give yourself ten seconds
to look at it whatever you're about to
do or buy and be like okay why am I
really spending money on this this even
helps in terms of groceries like if I'm
at the grocery store and I'm about to
put you know a big giant jungus smoothie
in my cart and I'm like hey why am I
really buying this smoothie is it
because it's pretty and I like the idea
of thinking that I would drink this
smoothie every morning or do I already
have all the ingredients at home to make
a smoothie and I'm just lazy and I just
think this looks like a really pretty
color and I'm buying it for that reason
so consciously you're like I really
shouldn't buy this but conscious you was
like come on just do it it's like the
little devil on your shoulder if you
know you're listening to the devil then
just say no put it down
again if you give yourself the two days
the 48 hours and you're still thinking
about it then maybe you can go back and
buy it but if in that 10 seconds you
really have to find a reason that you're
buying it
odds are you don't need it so don't
waste the money and then tip 11 and my
last and final tip is to give yourself a
visual reminder this could moved on on
your dream board on your wall on your
phone background in your agenda or your
day planner
something that you're gonna see every
day that's either reminding you of how
much debt you're trying to pay off or
how much money you're trying to save
having a visual reminder every single
day that says okay you know this is the
goal you're trying to get here and like
remind yourself every single day that I
need to get this paid off or I need to
save up so I can buy my Jeep or I need
to save up so I can buy a house or so I
can do this or this or that right those
little goals down everywhere so that no
matter where you're at you're gonna have
visual reminders every single day of
something you're actually working
towards which will always kind of
re-register your brain into not thinking
so present in the moment and a little
bit more into the future to realize that
you know you're trying to be responsible
with your money here you're trying to
work toward some sort of goal and
there's a reason why you want to save if
you're constantly reminding yourself of
those things and visually seeing it it's
going to be so much easier for you to
stick to your plan so those are all the
