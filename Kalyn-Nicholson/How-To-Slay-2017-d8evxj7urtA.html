lot of coffee so this is all over the
place
I highly apologize hey guys and welcome
back to my channel for today's video I
wanted to do I initially was actually
going to do a what my 2017 resolutions
are but I figured it would be more like
I don't know I'm showing you guys like
what my resolutions are which is a video
that I can still do if you guys want to
see but I figured sharing with you kind
of the mindset or how to set resolutions
for the new year would be more helpful
and beneficial for you guys today I'm
gonna share with you guys how to set
yourself up for success in the new year
and set yourself up to be just happier
in the new year any guys I'm following
me already be sure to check out my
Twitter Instagram I'll pop them up right
here on the screen pictures of me my
dogs on my Instagram so come check that
out and as the night guys wanna know my
4 steps to setting New Year's
resolutions and just keep watching so
step number one when it comes to setting
New Year's resolutions is to realize
that time is an illusion
bear with me humans created the concept
of time we created the concept of a new
year when you really backup from the
whole situation you realize that time is
a concept that we have created the day
before New Year's December 31st 2016 and
January 1st 2017 that's still just the
passage of a few hours which is another
concept that we created you're just
waiting for a new year to feel like you
have to have a clean slate to be able to
change your life then you're gonna fail
the minute you turn off this video 5
minutes from now an hour from watching
that we are always reinventing ourselves
life is constantly reinventing itself
life is constantly progressing and there
is no set time increment I'm just
praying to God that what I'm saying is
making sense but basically what I'm
getting at here is whatever you want to
change about your life start changing it
now you realize that whole concept of
people falling off their muse or
solutions by the time February or March
rolls around is
made it this big thing that is like I'm
going to be a new person in the new year
when there's just really no such thing
it's just a matter of every moment put
in front of you you can make the
conscious effort or decision or to do
the right thing for you when you just
make that your overall resolution
because in itself that is a resolution
keeps you from also getting overwhelmed
with the amount of things that we want
to change with our lives these are all
resolutions I want to do for 2017 and
then all of a sudden you're overwhelmed
you're anxious there's so many things
you want to change time is an illusion
so instead of putting so much pressure
on the new year and the resolutions just
see every single moment as an
opportunity to better yourself
step number two is to remind yourself or
if you don't already know this set
yourself a priority list
the thing about priorities is if you
want to change your life you have to
change what you hold as the highest
priority things in your life when you
really sit down and ask yourself what is
important to you and then you ask
yourself but what am I actually spending
my time on a lot of the times the amount
of time we spend wasting on things that
aren't even that important to us and
this is like a really good opportunity
to get real and honest with ourselves
you can put your family at the top of
your priority list you can put your
friends you can put your health you can
put you know making a difference in the
world at the top of your priority list
but deep down inside the little parts of
ourselves so we don't want to admit is
that we're putting how many followers we
have on the top of our priority list
we're putting how cool we feel based on
the parties we go to or the life that we
portray ourselves to live we actually
secretly hold those things at a very
high priority when you realize that
those things are a priority and there's
nothing wrong with wanting those things
as a priority in your life then you can
make the conscious decision to put it on
your priority list lower than the things
that are more important like friends
like family like your health like other
things the little parts of yourself that
knows that there's things that are still
important to you that you're not putting
on that list for fear that you're going
to admit that you're like a superficial
person just a little word like that it's
just if it's important to you then who
Kerr's let it be important to you but be
honest and put it on the list lower than
things that you really know are more
important step number three when it
comes to living a better life is not
asking ourselves what do we want I was
even doing that a few weeks ago where I
was like what do I want for myself in
2017 and this creates this kind of idea
where I'm picturing myself driving my
dream car what's more important as what
struggle do we want or what struggle are
we willing to go through to get what we
want only only ask ourselves what do we
want we become obsessed with this end
goal final destination that will beat
our sense of happiness and we're not
going to be happy until we get there so
when you realize that everything in life
comes with some sort of struggle or some
sort of work and effort that we have to
put in and realize that even the things
that we want most in our life we're
gonna have to do things that aren't as
fun to get those things it's not just
about the goals that we're setting for
ourselves that is what your goal is
going into the new year but you're not
realizing the struggle and the effort
and the time and the commitment then
you're never going to get there you're
going to fall off you're going to fail
because we're not being realistic about
the struggle and the time that goes into
getting those goals you'll realize the
things that you actually want like what
we're actually willing to put our time
which is super valuable into to getting
what we want and not only that it puts
more emphasis on the journey and not on
the end destination which is going to in
turn make us happier people and last but
not least stop wishing and start being
or doing this is going to contradict
everything I've almost set up into this
point to you guys but it was such a
mind-blowing realization that I have to
I just have to I had to put it in this
video and we say we want to be happier
when we say we want to be more
successful when we say we want to be
more beautiful get more gratification
get more satisfaction get more this get
more that we are putting emphasis on our
lap positive mindset we're trying to
push ourselves into is really making us
feel crappier about ourselves because it
is putting em
is on me not enough that we already are
me saying I want to be happier is
putting emphasis on the fact that I'm
already not happy enough which is making
that be a conscious thought constantly
going through my head if I'm making a
constant struggle to try and be happier
what I'm actually doing is constantly
reminding myself of unhappy I already am
let your actions speak louder than your
words or your wants or your wishes don't
think as much about it and that's not an
easy thing to do and we're going to
still catch ourselves wanting better the
faster we catch ourselves doing it the
faster we can shut that down we
don't go into the new year and then
think that our resolutions are going to
make the whole year completely perfect
for us there has to be a ying and yang
there has to be a bit of struggle we
have to get more real and honest and
start realizing that especially in this
day and age when we're flooded with
social media which is such an amazing
thing but can also highlight a lot of
insecurities in our life and we start
accepting ourselves for who we are is
when we will actually start living
better will actually start being happier
because we'll stop feeling this
overwhelming pressure to get rid of all
the bad things in our life and we'll
start accepting them and just dealing
with it faster so that we can get on
with the good things in our life this
year I was just feeling this
overwhelming pressure that like oh my
god the new year is coming I have to get
my resolutions done and I have to make
sure everything's clean and ready for
the ball drop and that midnight rolls
around so that I can just start living
this perfect life in 2017 and that's
just not it's not realistic it's not the
truth of life so those are the four
steps that I kind of come up with that
I'm going to kind of go into 2017 with
I'm still figuring it all out you're
still figuring it all out we're all just
trying to figure it all out so I'm going
to stop rambling here guys I hope

of that fun stuff leave it down below I
