today is day seven of you tober and for
today's video we're going to be talking
about getting fit for the Fall how to
start a fitness routine rather than just
showing you my own I feel like the fall
time is like the perfect time to start
setting new goals and such and I don't
know if it's just kind of like going
back to school or the end of summer or
whatever it is but around the fall time
I just feel like that's the easiest time
to kind of start establishing some goals
and getting into new routines and such
so if you're looking to start a new
healthy lifestyle and you're not sure
exactly how to do it then just keep
watching so tip number one is to get
excited and I know that it's like a hard
thing to get excited about you kind of
have to establish why you feel like you
want to start a healthy lifestyle is
that that lifestyle you're living right
now just isn't that healthy do you feel
really groggy and drained are you doing
it for your mental health are you doing
it just because you want to feel
physically better or are you doing it
for aesthetic reasons no matter what
just make sure that the whole reason why
you feel the need to start pushing
yourself to be healthy and fit is that
you're doing it from a good place and
you're not doing it from a place of self
hate when you come out of a place of
self hate and loathing it won't do you
any good you'll end up just feeling so
much worse and making the wrong choices
and the wrong mistakes and trying to
create shortcuts and it's not a healthy
thing to do so make sure you're going at
it from the right mindset in the right
perspective and get excited about it
because if you're not excited about it
and you don't look at it as like a full
lifestyle change to better yourself then
it's going to be like ridiculously hard
to stick to it
tip number two is out with the old and
in with the new what I mean by this is
go into your kitchen and get rid of all
of the junk food you need to establish
what your unhealthy habits are what
things that you want to change what
things that you know you're doing that
isn't healthy for you including eating
junk food and things like that and don't
feel like you have to go at all of it at
the exact same time what I like to do
and what I recommend is to set yourself
many challenges so I actually have a
little like post a wall above my
computer where I have like weekly
challenges or weekly - dues or things
that I just want to get done so you can
write down little challenges like this
weekend
you're not going to get any sort of
takeout food or a I want to drink two
liters of
honor things like that and once you
start doing that enough you're going to
pick up those habits a lot easier and
start ditching the old ones which leads
me into tip number three and that is to
make yourself a fitness plan now this is
going to be different for absolutely
everybody you don't have to go to the
gym if you hate going to the gym you
don't have to run if you hate running
you just have to find whatever source of
exercise it is for you that you enjoy
doing and that doesn't necessarily mean
that you have to lift weights go running
or do anything like that
you could join a dance class you can
walk your dog three miles or five
kilometers every single day you could
just find whatever it is kayaking
canoeing anything that's going to give
you some sort of physical exercise that
you actually enjoy doing me I love to
run but I also love going to the gym I
also love to walk my dog I also love to
do yoga videos at home I'm not really
one to lift weight what I'm trying to
get at is to find and establish a
workout plan that fits what you enjoy
doing but also is going to get you some
results tip number four is to eat right
you can workout as much as you want but
if you're going home and you're scarfing
down a whole pizza to yourself it's not
really gonna do much for you as you guys
know and I do highly highly highly
highly recommend researching the vegan
lifestyle I'm never pushy about the
vegan lifestyle with you guys it's just
something I truly do believe in it is
the best decision I ever made in my
entire life but even if you don't
necessarily want to go into the vegan
mysel although I do recommend it the
biggest thing that you can do no matter
what sort of meal plan you want to
follow is to eat as much Whole Foods as
possible when you go grocery shopping
try it and grocery shop around the
perimeter of the grocery store because
that's right all your natural and Whole
Foods are going to be implement a lot of
fruits and vegetables into your diet and
things that have high minerals and
vitamins and just basically nourish your
body from the inside right out of
grocery lists that you're not just
walking around and aimlessly throwing
things into your cart come up with
exactly what types of meals you want to
make that week so that you're not
tempted when you go to the grocery store
to throw a bag of Oreos into your thing
or being like I don't really know what
I'm going to make this week so maybe
I'll just grab a bunch of frozen dinners
if you have a plan and you go and
organize and know exactly what you're
there to get you're not going to have
that temptation to you know throw a
bunch of unhealthy foods in your cart as
well as making sure that
eat a snack or something before going
grocery shopping so that you're not
hungry
and a little disclaimer that I really do
want to throw in here too is calories
equals energy so I know that there's a
such a temptation in this day and age
and in this world to think that to
restrict yourself to restrict your
calories is going to make you smaller no
matter what you're doing no matter how
hard you feel you're struggling in terms
of getting into a healthy lifestyle or
maybe not feeling good in your body
right now
do not starve yourself in the literal
sense calories actually are made up of
energy so when you eat calories it gives
you the energy to you know laugh with
your friends to take your dogs for walks
to you know get your brain going and to
be creative and to be able to do things
that you love to do every day and when
you try and starve yourself to create a
shortcut to get to where you want to go
you're exhausted you're irritable your
mental health it goes all in a whack
your anxiety will raise and your
metabolism will slow down and start
storing everything as fat so I'm just I
just want to make this quick disclaimer
to never feel like you need to starve
yourself or restrict yourself to get to
the type of body type that you're trying
to get to don't hold any sort of
unrealistic expectation on yourself and
tip number five to remember it's a
lifestyle change and I know that that is
such a cliche thing to say and everybody
says it but it is so true you can't come
into this thinking okay well I just want
to get a big butt I just want to have a
small waist and then once I have that
I'll just drop all the things I've
learned to go back to the way I was
living before and have to fall in love
with your life and if you want to be a
healthier person then you have to learn
to love a healthier lifestyle for
yourself you don't have to force
yourself to eat certain things that you
don't want to eat or do certain things
you don't want to do you just have to
find a certain lifestyle that has a good
balance that works for you that you love
that you enjoy listen to your body and
listen to what it's trying to tell you
maybe you need to start sleeping more
maybe you need to be more hydrated maybe
you need to eat better foods maybe you
need to get moving maybe you need to you
know rest and relax creating a healthy
lifestyle isn't just eating the right
foods and working out it's honestly it's
a well-rounded thing you need to make
sure that you're covering every single
playing field in order to make sure that
you're being happy and you're being
healthy and you're treating yourself
right because you deserve it you deserve
to put in that time that effort and
that money to invest in being a happier
and a healthier person I know I sound so
preachy right now but I'm telling you
one of the biggest things that has ever
ever helped me in my life was pushing
myself to stop self sabotaging and being
lazy and procrastinating doing the right
things for my body and just starting to
actually do that I am exhausted all the
time my moods are all over the place my
anxiety is super high that is your body
trying to tell you things so listen to
it and start implementing changes that
are good for you and implementing
changes that are going to make you feel
better and live a happier and a
healthier life so those are all the tips
that I have for you guys today in terms
of starting a healthier lifestyle if you
guys have anything to add be sure to
