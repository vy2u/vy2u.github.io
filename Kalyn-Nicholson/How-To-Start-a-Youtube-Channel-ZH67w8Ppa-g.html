you there's a massive spider on my
ceiling no no not okay
oh my god swimming I'm gonna be like
watching that the whole time I found
this now hey guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's Ito video I wanted
to talk to you guys about starting a
YouTube channel this was such a highly
highly requested video over the last
little bit so I figured I would share
with you guys my tips and tricks the
things that I have learned through
starting my channel and just yeah my
advice to you guys if you guys want to
start a YouTube channel if you guys
aren't following me already I'm going to
leave my twitter at my Instagram right
here on the screen so you guys can go
click away and follow me and other than
that if you guys want to know what my
tips and tricks for starting a YouTube
channel then just keep watching so tip
number one would be probably to find
your niche find what it is that you want
to make youtube videos about whether
that be lifestyle there's comedy there's
cooking and like recipes veganism there
is advice lifestyle fitness beauty
vlogger literally so many different
things you can do on YouTube and you can
also make a conjunction of all of these
different genres and make it your own
genre on YouTube you can really make
videos about whatever you please so
figuring out what you want to make
videos about is probably the first and
most important things so then you can
start making the videos like make videos
about things that are about you and show
off who you are and show off your style
and show off what you're into to be
honest you guys I didn't even really
find my phone niche until I think I was
like a year and a half in we're really
starting to be like okay this is my
favorite kind of content to make so feel
free to kind of test out a bunch of
different things try out different
videos and see what you end up liking
and see what fits for you tip number two
it would be then to find the equipment
and you don't have to let this be a hold
back for you if you're waiting to start
a channel because you feel like you
don't have a good enough camera or good
enough equipment yet all is gonna come
with time but if you don't start now
than you probably never going to most of
us have like iPhones now and laptops so
if you have an iPhone these are pretty
dang good cameras to start with if you
have to start with your phone
who cares start by filming with your
phone getting your
goes out there editing them on like free
movie editing software on your laptop or
computer I know that back foot comes
with iMovie I used iMovie until about a
year and a half ago I was like Windows
Movie Maker you could download a free
video editor just start with what you
have and you'll start to learn more
about the equipment as you go for those
of you that are curious as to what
equipment I do use I will leave links to
everything down below my vlog camera is
the sony a5100 and
70d camera which is what i'm filming on
now bentley i can hear a little pause in
the hallway umm this lens on this is a
sigma i believe it took a 33 or 35
millimeter and i have like a lighting
setup and then I also have a tripod and
a gorilla pod and a microphone but those
are all things that I got like
progressively with time I started
originally with just one little camera
like a really crappy camera and yeah my
laptop my third tip would be to find
your aesthetic and this is just more of
like a personal preference thing for me
it's funny because I noticed since
starting youtuber and uploading videos
every day and doing like so many in such
a short period of time I started to
create this sort of aesthetic without
even meaning to where I was using
similar filters on my photos and my
videos but you don't have to go that far
you can just find a general style like
something that is similar within your
photos and within your videos and within
yourself that people can expect to see
when they come to your channel it's
basically like building your own brand
you're building a brand around yourself
when you put yourself out there for
social media and so stay on that dick
and stay true to yourself so that your
brand is truly who you are don't feel
like you have to fake any sort of
personality or any sort of like
aesthetic to fit in but that said create
an aesthetic around yourself similar
colors similar backgrounds similar
content even doing something like this
behind me here on the desk where I
always have something kind of festive
going on back here just to kind of
create a little bit more of an aesthetic
or a vibe when someone's watching my
video and with that aesthetic use that
within your thumbnails too thumbnails
are so so important make sure your
titles are clear make sure your
thumbnails all kind of match and you can
see what it is someone's going to be
clicking on when you go for the video
these are just a little tiny ideas hints
and tasks and things that you can do
that creates an overall like
seamlessness to yourself and
seamlessness
your videos and who you are and it's
going to make people want to come back
for more because they can only find that
through you in your videos because it's
you created it you created an aesthetic
you created a brand around yourself and
this can even be picking what days you
decide to upload videos on your banner
if someone's following my Instagram and
my YouTube and my Twitter and they see
the things that I post on all three of
those that all kind of like goes
together so my fourth tip is to not do
it for the numbers because I feel like
anyone that starts at YouTube channel
thinking like I'm only here to get
followers or subscribers it's going to
suck you're not going to enjoy it
because it takes a while it takes time
it's not an easy thing to do it's a long
process trying to build up you know a
sort of YouTube channel or a brand
around yourself if it weren't for the
fact that it took me almost four years
to get here I wouldn't have been able to
find myself find my brand find my voice
throughout those four years I wouldn't
have been ready for years ago the
numbers aren't just gonna be there right
away if you do it for the genuine love
of doing it for the genuine love of
creating videos or just creating in
general then you're staying true and
you're staying authentic and the process
won't seem so daunting or annoying
because you're not doing it to get a
bunch of followers you're doing it
because you love creative I think for me
in the beginning the thing that kept me
going through the fact that nobody was
following me was that I just loved
creating videos I loved editing footage
I loved coming up with new ways to
create an emotion or a vibe or even some
sort of theme to a video and so through
that and through finding different ways
to film at different angles different
ways to edit it and so that's kind of
what kept me coming back to it and kept
me going even though at the beginning
nobody was following me I'd get like
three comments if you're doing it
because you love to do it you're doing
it as a hobby then you're doing it right
so number five is I'm kind of like set
it throughout the video but overall is
just to be original be yourself don't
feel like you have to like I said before
be a certain way or act a certain way if
you want to sit in front of a camera and
create videos you might be able to find
two people that create similar content
but have two completely different
personality two completely different
styles and I know that's kind of like a
hard thing to do nowadays with social
media and YouTube is to be original
because in in one way or another we're
all being inspired by one another and
creating new versions of the same thing
over and over and over again feel
inspired
by others and then add your own personal
Flair to it way I like to look at it is
when I sit down and I go to film I act
as if the camera is just an old friend
of mine that I've known since I was
little
anyone that's known me since I was
little would be able to pick up right
away if I'm not being myself and so if I
act as if I'm always hanging out with an
old friend when I go to film or do
anything then it takes the pressure to
act a different way or act a certain way
also yeah just be original be true to
who you are and add your own personal
flair to all of the things that inspire
you in my last and final tip for you
guys is patience and persistence be
patient and enjoy the process if you get
so caught up in the end results are
never going to enjoy the journey I mean
that's not even just for starting a
YouTube channel that's just for freaking
life we can't always just want to be at
the end game we have to enjoy every
single step every single process and
have the patience to wait for the things
that are coming for us and hope that if
we try hard and we're persistent and we
work hard for the things that we really
want in life then we're sending that
energy out into the world and we're
going to open those doors for ourselves
and we're going to create the lives that
we want to by staying positive same
patience and staying persistent and this
is so important at the very very
beginning guys honestly if you're
worried about feeling embarrassed if
you're worried about nobody watching or
following or if you're worried about
sucking I worried about all of those
things too and I got made fun of so so
hard and if I would have let that you
know dampen my mood and stop me from
being persistent and stopped me for just
going for it anyway then I wouldn't be
here right now I wouldn't be sitting in
front of this camera talking to you guys
right now so I know it's scary and I
know that it might not feel like the
right time but it's never going to feel
like the right time and if it's
something that you really and genuinely
honestly want to do and love to do then
just do it you're only on this earth one
time you get one go at life for all we
know so if we don't take up the time
that is given to us and use it to do the
things that we love and the things that
we really want to do then what the heck
is the point of being here you know and
we just literally connected starting a
YouTube channel to something super deep
and philosophical but it is so true
whether you want to start a YouTube
channel whether no matter what it is you
want to do in life don't let anyone tell
you you crazy don't let yourself stand
in your own way just go for it just do
it so that was it for my tips on how to
start a YouTube channel I hope you
