vlog off the energy is gonna rise just
give me a few minutes and a cup of
coffee but welcome hi he just got back
from Arizona yesterday it was the
longest I'm not even getting it into it
it was a long journey home we were
stranded in Denver I got like two hours
of sleep yesterday I don't know if you
guys are like this but I feel like any
time I have a really bad sleep or I
don't get much sleep it doesn't
necessarily hit me the next day eh k
yesterday so it's like two to three days
after that I'm like wow I feel winded it
kidding me today but for today's video
I'm doing another coffee Chronicle with
you guys now that I'm back home I'm
actually heading to my hometown tomorrow
so I really only have today to get a lot
of stuff done I basically figured it
would be finally kind of vlog it with
you guys because there's so many things
that I'm working on and so many projects
going on but I myself I'm trying to
stick really hard to my goals lately you
know stick to your guns get things done
and so I figured why not turn it into a
vlog vlog might day and just give you
guys my two cents on sticking to your
goals we always talk about planning our
goals but I feel like I haven't done a
video in a while where it's like how to
stick to them how to actually follow
through that's gonna be today's video
take a seat grab a coffee I'm about to
do the same because I'm real tired I set
a lot of goals for 2018
found a new sense of confidence in
myself solely because this is the first
year I feel like I've not only set goals
but actually started following through
on a lot of them seeing what you're
actually capable of and kind of
surprising yourself what the things are
capable of gives you such a sense of
confidence that it means you want to
reach for more now that we're in the
middle of the year I feel like I'm kind
of right in the thick of the brush you
know just like everything is going on at
once construction go
so realistically I have a lot of a lot
of projects and goals going on right now
and that kind of leads me to the first
and foremost tip when it comes to
sticking to your goals and it's to know
what your goals actually are and why
which is something that I feel like we
talk about a lot on this channel it's
like planning goals establishing what
you want to accomplish why you want to
accomplish it all that fun stuff I did a
plan with me for June and I wrote down
like all the things I'm kind of trying
to accomplish all the stuff that I
really want to get done this month I
also like to make a note in my like
notes folder on my laptop because it
also syncs to my cell phone kind of
anchor my focus again it has all the
things that I need to kind of be working
on for the month including like videos
and overall goals blog posts podcast
episodes so that if there's ever like
any confusion as to what I should be
working on next it's kind of laid out
there for me and my focal points and so
that's kind of what I mean
by figuring out your why because we
can't just establish what goals we want
to accomplish if we don't know why we
want to accomplish them it's going to be
impossible to follow through I could set
the goal to run a marathon let's say but
if I don't really have a reason why I
want to run a marathon there's not gonna
be any burning fire of passion or energy
for me to go after and like train and
actually do what it what it takes to run
a marathon so every time I'm at the
beginning of the month when I'm setting
my goals I just like to establish why
and it also kind of keeps my intentions
pure sometimes I might even be setting
goals without even realizing that my Y
is really stupid if it's like
realistically it's not something I
really need to be stressing about that's
something that aligns with what I'm
trying to manifest in my life not really
a main priority for me can let this goal
go kind of thing
so now that I've flowered about that
have your goals ready establish why
you're doing them that is the foundation
staying on track of everything is
preparing for everything
and they try coffee now
when your dishes ain't done yet step
number two I would have in terms of
sticking to your goals is to set up your
day by breaking down bigger tasks into
smaller tasks so there's one really big
task in particular I have to work on
today it requires a lot of paperwork
it's just like a lot of boring banking
adulting stuff that I just like don't
want to do it's a goal that I've set for
myself solely for today and also - it's
a goal that like I definitely need to do
because it's just part of life breaking
it down into smaller goals even down to
just having to send an email is
something that is going to be one easy
for me to accomplish but - it's gonna
make me feel that like little sense of
reward of finishing something which is a
then going to help fill the bucket up
rather than waiting - the bucket is
totally full and trying to fill the
whole bucket in one go you take trips
and you fill the bucket slowly but
surely which makes it easier to carry
the load
the thing that I've kind of noticed
about our generation and something that
I struggle a lot with too is that I feel
like we have a lack of focus because
things like our cell phones cause us to
constantly be instantly distracted I
capacity to be able to just sit down and
do something the time limit is just
getting shorter and shorter as I'm like
literally supposed to be doing something
I'm trying to focus on something else do
turtles have feelings I don't know I was
eating my breakfast this morning and
doing my morning reading and a quote
that I read 10% of 10 things is not a
hundred percent of one thing so instead
of trying to do a million things at once
set your day up that you can focus in on
one thing at a time and break down the
bigger tasks if it's something that you
can't get done in one day and just
smaller ones that you can focus in on
and get that one thing done a hundred
percent rather than trying to get ten
things done at the same time because
that's how you end up burning out that's
how you end up feeling overwhelmed and
just stressed out tell yourself that no
matter what you end up getting done
today that you're just gonna try the
best that you can and then you don't
have to feel any sense of guilt or like
dissatisfaction with how much you end up
getting - so for me right now I need to
drink this coffee I have so many backed
up emails from while was away I need to
do a couple tasks that are a breakdown
of some bigger tasks and I need to
refill out
my calendars having a general overall
awareness of what the next few weeks are
gonna look like so again I don't get too
overwhelmed if then go for a little run
to break up the tasks which is a point
that we'll get to later and talk to you
guys all at point now is your evening
okay newest update / tip number three my
third tip for staying on top of things
and accomplishing your goals is to get
the hardest things done and out of the
way at the beginning of the day I did
all the things that I just really wasn't
excited about you know bursts like that
stupid paperwork and all of that stuff
because now everything else I do for the
rest of the day is a lot more fun and I
don't have to stress about it i
procrastinate doing the things that I
really don't want to do or the things
that I know are gonna take me the
longest because I just don't feel like
doing them and then I get all the fun
stuff done first and then end up not
having time to do the bigger thing at
the end of the day or all day I'm so
stressed about it that I don't even get
to enjoy the funner things not to
mention like we have our highest energy
peak at the beginning of the day so when
you have all that built up like you
haven't even started yet you know that
drive is still there whereas as the
day's gonna progress your ambition and
your drive is slowly just gonna just
decline so if you get it done first then
it's out of the way and you're more
likely to feel so accomplished that
you're gonna carry that into the next
tasks you're the first thing you think
of when you wake up in the morning is
like if I make it fun brew yourself a
coffee you know in between doing the
paperwork I was painting my nails and as
they were drying then I was like fill it
what I needed to fill out just to make
it more fun and I'm also it was the
first time I've had color of my nails in
like weeks guys and it's like I went for
a pretty coral kind of matches my recent
I've been obsessed with coral lately now
that the bigger annoying task is out of
the way I've unpacked my bags that was
the other thing I had to do and put some
of my clothes away through a load of
laundry on breaking up the bigger tasks
with some smaller tasks I might hop on
my bike however too fresh and sit on
their patio there's some other stuff
that I need to work on so I'm thinking
of just getting out of the house going
there bringing my laptop and we ordering
some kombucha and a bootable stuff cut
to some bike and some Buddha bowls
shadowind
Hunter's fat me Vic
of darkness
Oh terrible lighting I'm working with
right now
reminds me it snake time so it's
actually been a few days since the
earlier clips in this coffee Chronicle
because tonight has been a huge huge
just night I decided to take tonight to
just get back on track which fit so
nicely into all of the tips and tricks
that we have been at kind of dabbling
into in order to keep our together
also look at the back of this these are
gonna be going up on coats on Thursdays
so definitely check out for that but in
terms of my next tip when it comes to
staying on track of your goals bring it
back to the basics it's something that
my friend Larissa said to me once and
it's like ever since she said that I
can't I can't get it out of my mind the
back to the basics because it's such an
easy term to say or like a motto to say
things just so much truth when you're
trying to accomplish goals and you're
juggling a lot at once which is exactly
where I've been at lately something
that's been kind of stressing me out a
little bit when you just bring it on
back to the basics and like stop over
complicating everything I find it's a
lot easier to stay on track with your
goals bring it back to the basics of
getting enough sleep drinking enough
water eating healthy foods and you know
meditating and moving your body those
are like my top five basics that as long
as I'm bringing it back to those five
things everything else in my life tends
to kind of you know run its own course
and shift and move in ways that makes it
easier for me to kind of show up as my
best self I am the worst for self
sabotaging especially when it comes to
staying up late to meet deadlines or you
know eating takeout instead because they
just don't have time to cook not
drinking enough water and then I wonder
why I feel cloudy and I wonder why I
feel lethargic or tired and so when you
bring it back to the basics and you're
kind of staying on top of those things
generally you know fueling your body and
fueling your mind to show up as your
best self
it makes staying on top of your goals so
much easier because you're constantly
arriving with the full capacity to put
your whole energy and your whole focus
into one of these you're trying to do
also reminds me when it comes to trying
to get a lot done at once - doing things
that I enjoy doing almost like a little
you know reward system so whether that's
drinking a coffee or reading a chapter
out of my books doing a little bit of
Tarot yoga sometime
I find yoga is such a good way to just
kind of decompress and break up the
things that I'm trying to do throughout
the day so even if you work at like an
office let's say just go outside and
stroll around your building for five
minutes just to break up your day and
break up your tasks it also makes it to
sit like if I'm like writing out my
podcast scripts or I'm answering emails
or I'm editing a video if I'm like okay
if I can get this done 100% then I know
I'm gonna take Bentley to the park and
just be able to like decompress for 15
minutes 20 minutes and just like not
have to focus on this anymore so I just
finished most of my bigger tasks for
today at the only thing I have left to
do is really finish off filming this
vlog with you guys I'm gonna do a little
bit Tarot you know read a couple
chapters of my book and then touch back
with you guys for my last and final tip
when it comes to staying on top of your
goals the people what they want we want
Bentley over your tasks today
the stick strange darkness comes
creeping on so huffing every time
and as I scared I cow
Western all the spiders jaw cheese beans
and eating their insides like in the
station to call you and hearing boys up
trees on you'll come home and stop it
ain't no stop these pants
so last last few tips when it comes to
staying on track of your goals by the
way today I woke up and I'm officially
back on track I've never felt so good in
my life the next step that I have that's
been really helping me lately is to just
set everything out and prep myself the
night before so that when I wake up in
the morning everything's kind of already
you know laid out for me to just start
my day successful because I find one I'm
productive in the mornings it's easier
for it to carry into my day versus when
I wake up and I'm unprepared and I'm
like half asleep struggling around
trying to figure out exactly what I
should be doing then it kind of sets
that tone for the day right now I have
to do a bit of emails and then I'm going
to do some yoga so I have like my yoga
gear on underneath but I left my yoga
outfit out so that I put it on right
away and I know that I'm gonna do my
yoga if I'm gonna be working out in the
mornings and I'll set up my workout
outfit and if I'm going to be doing
anything in particular that day I like
to set out even just like my outfit of
the day especially now that that's been
getting nicer oh I've been having so
much fun like planning out outfits and
looks and stuff pulling out a mug and
know it sounds silly but when I first
wake up in my mug is already just
sitting there and like my coffee's ready
to just be pressed and made and it
instantly makes me more excited and just
kind of groove into the day faster I
also like to leave out my to-do list for
the day because obviously I don't need
to know what I need to do and the night
before I'll make sure I'll list
everything that I need to get done and
then I leave anything that I'd like to
get done on a separate piece of paper so
that I have to only focus on the needs
and not the wants if I can get all the
needs done I'm able to move on to the
ones without stressing myself up I think
I need to get all of it done does that
make sense and I also send out my
hundred days half of your books I like
to read one of these every morning
today's was super fitting what means to
let go it says trying to stay in control
of everything all the time is exhausting
today why not save your energy and boost
your self esteem by just letting go
things may not turn out perfect
but they will still be good enough which
preach amen
preparation is one of those things that
when I feel prepped I feel primed and so
if I'm not prepped my brain is just like
a massive heated mess even if I have a
messy day where I didn't get as much
done I still like to spend that night
setting myself up to do better the next
day I think it also boils down to just
being kind of happy and accepting the
where you are at all times in order to
be able to do better with whatever it is
your guys are trying to accomplish all
of our goals might be different all of
us might be kind of striving towards
different things but I think that when
we learn to accept where I accept the
things that we aren't able to get done
and accept exactly where personally
where we're at mentally we're physically
like it makes it so much easier to then
work with what we have rather than
resist against what we have and wish
that we were further along on our
journey or like further along on our
path be happy and accept where you are
while you're working towards where
you're trying to get or where you want
to be stay light enjoy where you're at
make all the things that you're doing
like a play date rather than a must do
and your goals and accomplishments will
grow naturally without needing that
force you know it'll it'll flow so with
that I hope you guys enjoyed this a
little kind of vlog style coffee talk
mixture I don't even know what this this
is just a cocktail of many videos on how
to stay on top of your goals you guys

thumbs up or let me know down below if
