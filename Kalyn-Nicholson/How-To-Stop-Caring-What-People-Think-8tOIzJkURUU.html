Hey!
Bentley don't make me move you
Bentley's currently staring out the window, and there's a dog park in front of
my building. Hence...the...
Hence that.
Welcome back to my channel!
Today is officially Day 4 of Youtober and if you guys
haven't seen the first three days of Youtober I will
link them down below as well as pop them somewhere up on the screen
I've created a full playlist for you guys, so you guys can make sure that you're watching
every single day from now until the end of October
and that brings you a new video every single day from
now until Halloween! For today's video I'm going to be doing a coffee talk
with you guys, and the topic of today's coffee talk is how
to not care about what people think.
Lately I've just been really wanting to break free of
the kind of
prison that we hold ourselves in when it
comes to filtering through our actions, our behaviours
and the things we say, based on what we think we're gonna be judged for, and what we think
other people are gonna think about it. You can't help but wonder, like
why on earth do we put so much weight or why
do we allow our actions or our behaviours or our decisions to be
so heavily manipulated by what other people think. We have this fear
in our heads that, if we make the wrong move or if we make a decision
that people won't agree with, that we're gonna be labelled, we're gonna
be judged. Maybe the thing that we fear people think about us
is really something that we secretly fear is a truth about
ourselves. We might fear that we won't be accepted
There are so many different things that play into the reason why we
start to become these creatures that like
lose ourselves, because we're so busy trying to appease to everybody else
And this comes from a long history of any time you've been bullied, any
time you've been ridiculed, any time you've been made fun of
any time you haven't been accepted
or something you've done has kind of resulted in people
shutting you out, or, maybe
people not being so happy with you. This deeply engrained into your subconscious
as
every time I make a decision to do something different
I will become an outcast, or I will become
unhappy. And so, every single time you've done something different
or every single time you've, maybe, come
into conflict with someone who didn't agree with you, or maybe he wasn't fond of you
it deeply engrained this truth inside your head that
you can't be who you are because it might
mean other people won't like you. Or you may have created a habit that
stopped you from, just, openly and honestly being yourself
and in turn, constantly, are aware of how
other people might perceive you. And for that reason, you might stop doing
things that are true to who you are, er, you know
wearing things that you wanna wear, or saying things that
you wanna say in fear of what other people might think. And so if any
of that kind of resonates with you, there are five main things
to remember, when it comes to not caring and
not letting the thoughts and the opinions of others control
your life. And this. Is. Them.
Dramatic coffee pause.
Number one: what you think you attract
it's important to remember that, what we think we become and
if we're constantly worrying and we're constantly in fear
of what other people are gonna think of us, if we're gonna be accepted
then we become these fear-filled
anxious, socially awkward doormats
to other people. People will stop taking us seriously.
You might realize that you become
this sponge that just soaks up what everybody else is doing and doesn't have
much of a backbone and I say that
from experience, because I have been there, I have become so
you know, filled with my fear of what other people might think of me
that I stopped kind of being myself and just became forgettable
tasteless, I became flavourless and I became someone that
i didn't feel resonated with who I was, I just wanted to
appease to everyone. It's definitely a phase that
I've come in and out of in my life, where I start to let the thoughts
and the opinions of others, you know, weigh so heavily on my mind that
i stopped doing things, and I, I
always second-guess everything I'm doing and I'd just become completely
like as if I have no personality. I gone in and out of phases of
becoming a people pleaser or a pushover, it just, honestly it just
attracts more of that into your life, so try
your hardest to think more positively, think
more confidently about yourself, and even if
you don't believe it, just fake it till you make it. If you're
trying to do something or if you wanna say something, or you wanna make a change in your life but you're not sure about how other people
might think about it,
ask yourself, like, how do you think about it
and if there's even one reason that you wanna do it, go at it
with that kind of confidence, and trust me it will follow
you'll attract more of that confidence to you and what you think
you'll eventually become, act confident.
Don't be a pushover, don't lose your backbone
you receive what you attract. Number two: it's a them problem
everyone on this earth should try and go through life being authentically them because there's nobody else to be
and, also while being authentically them, trying to accept
the differences of other people and, honestly, appreciate them
and if other people don't give you that respect, that reflects on
who they are and not on who you are. A lot of people are afraid of change, they're afraid of what makes us all different
because they want safety, if you've ever fallen victim to
caring about what people think, odds are it's because you wanted that safety blanket
that made you feel like you were secure, that you were cared for
that you weren't an outcast. if you let go of that fear
and you just accept that everybody's gonna be different including yourself
and that's ok. As long as you're not hurting anyone at the end of the day
everybody has a right to be truly who they are
other people will hopefully follow lead,  and if they don't
it honestly stems from a deep lying insecurity within themselves
and it has nothing to do with you. And I know it's really hard to kind of
make that differentiation in your mind, it's really hard to
cut ties with letting other people's opinions
weigh on you but every time that someone pushes you out
or says something mean about you, or doesn't accept or
support something that you decided to do or say
ask yourself is it something that you're doing wrong
or is there something going on in this person's life or some sort of insecurity
that might be causing this person to think or behave this way
pity them, because if you pity them, then
it gives you the power back. Never ever ever fall prey to
other people's insecurities. Number three: You
only get one life. When you gain some perspective, you realize that
honestly, we're on this earth for one life that we know of
ok? I'm not throwing anything out of possibilities. But from
what we know, we only get one life on this earth and
think about it, from the day you were born to the day you die, you only have a set amount
of time here, a set amount of time in your body, a set amount of time
to harness your soul and harness the things that make you who you are
and harness the things you wanna create in this life and so,
every single day we waste letting other people's
opinions manipulate our actions and who we are
and who we let ourselves become
is a huge waste of our own time
we need to stop letting what other people might think about us
keep us from reaching our full potential get some perspective
ask yourself what is the worse possible thing that could happen so what
a couple of people maybe don't like you or so what
a couple of people maybe don't agree with what you're doing or what you're saying
or who you are. That's ok. There's like a good old saying that's like
I'd rather be someone's shot of whiskey than everybody's cup of tea
and it's just, it's true. Wouldn't you much rather get along with
people who are likeminded than be liked by
absolutely everyone, but also risk the potential of being a pushover
or people not taking you seriously. And honestly
screw em, because we can just bring it all the way back
to tip number two which is, it's about them, it's not about you
so just be who you are, accept other people
and make the most of all of the time that you have on this earth
which leads me to tip number four: you are never gonna please everyone
it's just impossible. There's another old saying
I feel like I'm just throwing out all these sayings right now
but it's &quot;you can't burn yourself just to keep other people warm&quot;
Cause, you'll end up with nothing left for yourself at the end of the day
even if you absolutely tried to do everything that
everybody else wanted from you, there will still be people that don't like you
and it's just inevitable, so you might as well
take the time and like yourself because that's the most important person
at the end of the day
you have to ask yourself: do you agree with the things you're doing, do you agree with the things you're saying
and if the answer is yes, then you can't control what anybody
else has to say about them
Sirens. I hope the person's ok, but
can we shh. And lastly tip number five:
set yourself free. Be honest with who you are, be
authentic with who you are, be real, all the time.
If you're constantly honest, there's no way you can never not be
who you are. Get rid of all the sources of negativity in your life
get rid of the people who don't accept you for who you really wanna be
these people have no place in life, for anyone
that isn't truly loving and supportive of who you are
and cares for you down to your core. Have your knit group
of people that you genuinely do trust, and I say this
in the sense where we have to be very careful with this, but we do need
some sort of balance. For me, I have about
five people, whose opinions that I will never you know
not take a little bit seriously at least
everybody's still going to be different but if you have at least
three to five people that you know genuinely care about you, that you trust
are gonna give you their honest opinion while still looking out for your
best interest, that is also important. Because we do need that
balance, you don't have to always take it, but it's good to have it.
Keep your group of opinions
that you do take even just a little bit into account small
but make sure that they're people that you trust and that actually care about you
put yourself out there
do the things that you wanna do, wear the clothes that you wanna wear, wear the makeup
you wanna wear, go after the dream that you wanna go after
be crazy, be loud, put yourself out there
and stop living so afraid and so quiet
speak your mind, be eccentric, and
lastly with all of this, set yourself free by making yourself
a dream list of things that kind of make you uncomfortable
with where you're at right now, like for me, a huge dream
of mine for so long, was to move out of my hometown
to a new city. And, I know that, for some people
moving from a little town, like Kingston, to Toronto which is only
two and a half hours away, might not seem that much. But for me
it was really big, because it forced me so far out of my comfort zone
I had to make new friends, I had to put myself out there
and there's still so many dreams that I wanna achieve that
right now, they seem a little scary because it's going to make me
uncomfortable, it's gonna pull me out of my comfort zone, but
those are who you really wanna be, these are the dreams that are going to
lead you to the person that you're trying to become, and these are the things that
are making you and forcing you to be confident in who you are
and trust, you know, yourself. Whether deep down in the
pits of your mind, you wanna move to New York City
or you wanna create your own fashion line, or you wanna put yourself on
YouTube, or you know, you just wanna cut off your hair
or wear a different style of clothes, you wanna be able to
take yourself out for dinner, you wanna be able to go to the movies alone
whatever it is, just make a list of things that you've always kinda wanted to do
but were always a little bit afraid to do and just start doing them
every single time you speak your mind freely and honestly
every single time you make a decision that sits well with
who you are at your core, you become a little bit
more confident and strong and not caring or being controlled by what
anybody else thinks. And so, that is it
