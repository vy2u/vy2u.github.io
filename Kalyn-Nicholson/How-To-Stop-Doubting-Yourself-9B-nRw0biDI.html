today's mug is a New York City mug it's
like one of the og mugs from this
channel there you go hey guys what's up
and welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm going to be doing
another coffee talk with you guys this
is the first ever coffee talk in 2018
which is so epic and I feel like we're
starting we're starting on a good one if
you guys remember I feel like it was
back in October or November that rhymed
I said that I kind of wanted to theme my
weeks of videos the videos that go live
that week almost kind of sync together
if you haven't noticed I've kind of
already been doing that leading in to
2018
yesterday I posted a vlog all about how
I deal with my anxiety and it was more
hands-on things you can do tips and
tricks that I like to use if you haven't
seen it I will link it up on the screen
or put it down below but today's video
is kind of a coffee talk that ties into
that and this is more of you know like
the sit down let's have a life chat
about it how to stop doubting yourself I
wasn't really sure what I wanted to call
this I initially had how to chest your
life how to get confident how to be
anxiety but I don't think you actually
truly ever beat it so I couldn't call it
that how to go from anxious to able and
it just kind of boiled down to honestly
how to stop doubting yourself because a
lot of the time anxiety just stems from
a very deep doubt that you feel about
the world about life about your current
situation about the present moment about
yourself about other people and I think
in recognizing that we can find ways to
kind of counteract that doubt and get
back to living you know more consciously
and feeling more confident and feeling
more sure of ourselves really quick if
you guys are following me already I'm
gonna pop my Twitter my Instagram and my
blog as you're watching this I'm either
on my way or landing in Hawaii I can't
figure out the time difference I'm I'm
in that general direction which is this
way the blog is currently under some
major construction I'm redoing the
entire thing I'm like decent at HTML
work but I'm not that great and now
finally if you guys want to know my
seven tips when it comes to not doubting
yourself and trusting your life again
that then just keep watching so when I
was brainstorming all the ways
you can kind of work through that
mindset of self-doubt one of the biggest
themes that I noticed that was popping
up it was going at everything already
feeling defeated so I feel like the
first tip when it comes to not doubting
yourself anymore is to challenge your
defeated attitude I think that when we
judge ourselves for feeling defeated we
only make ourselves feel more defeated I
know I do that and I know people I know
other people that do that too they they
catch themselves going into everything
thinking that they've already failed or
thinking that they're already not good
enough and once you catch yourself
thinking that way your first reaction is
to judge yourself like why do I do this
why am I this way why does my brain work
this way which just makes you feel
literally worse instead of judging your
defeated attitude just try challenging
it don't question why it's there don't
make yourself feel little or small
because of it just challenge those
thoughts for instance when you catch
yourself thinking what if I fail or I'm
going to fail what if you didn't fail
what if you actually succeeded what if
you just tried and even if you failed at
least you know you're just putting your
all I've talked about this before but
Jensen Cheryl in the book you are about
asked one of my favorite things that I
ever pulled from that book was I just
want to see if I can and that is such an
easy way to challenge that to feed an
attitude inside your brain is to just be
like you know why I don't care whether I
succeed or I fail so I'm just gonna
throw that thought away and I'm just
gonna see if it ends up working out it's
not just about whether you're good
enough whether your circumstances are
right whether everything's lining up
it's a little bit of all of those things
coming together you won't always fail
sometimes you will but sometimes you
won't and there's no way to know unless
you just try every time you go into
anything thinking that it's already
gonna suck doubting yourself doubting
everything like those into whatever it
is you're about to go into even if it's
just as simple as waking up that day and
going into like your day to day routine
and thinking today is going to suck
challenge it by thinking but what if it
doesn't suck what if it ends up being a
great day and I spent this morning
feeling like crap I just want to see if
I can have a good day despite the fact
that I feel this way and when you
challenge you're defeated attitude that
way it opens up the possibility of one
not failing but also - it's not telling
yourself that you're necessarily wrong
it's just telling yourself to not come
to a conclusion too soon and to just try
it anyway and with that you trust
yourself just a little bit more my
second tip
comes to not doubting yourself is to
welcome everything that comes into your
life if you sit around and you feel
anxious and you worry about things that
could happen you're honestly just
attracting more of that bad energy to
you try and see it through this
perspective no matter if things are good
or bad in a way it's all good sometimes
I'll just have to say to myself like
it's all good it's all good it's got a
flat tire it's all good I'm just
learning how to change my own tire so
that what happens next time I'm more
educated missed an appointment it's all
good now I know that time management is
something that I really should work on
this taught me something of course
there's things in life that we can't
always attribute this to I mean when you
lose somebody love or when something
really bad is happening in the world
that you feel you have no control over
it's really hard to play this game of
whether good or bad it's all good but in
some way or another
we can find something good about all the
bad someone that I lost that was really
close to me that I still think about
every single day and still miss so much
to my core is my papa
he was the guy who wrote the signature
on the side of my hand he was like he
was just so wise and comforting such a
comforting soul to be around losing him
sucked and there it's hard to say that
there's ever a good thing you could spin
on that but when I try and see it this
way whether it's good or bad it's all
good the fact that I even got that
relationship with my Papa the fact that
I even got to know him the fact that
there is a piece of him that still is
within me is the good in the bad it's
the fact that I even had that chance to
know him to grow into more of who I was
growing up because of him that is the
good inside that bad when it comes to
trusting yourself if you tell yourself
that no matter what happens to you good
or bad it's all good it makes us let you
can stop feeling so afraid of life and
stop feeling so afraid of yourself or
your shortcomings or your failures
because even when you do fail even when
bad things happen to you it's teaching
you a lesson or it's giving you some
sort of knowledge for the future and
knowledge is confidence and knowledge is
power and knowledge is going to give you
that boost that you need to stop
doubting yourself even more than next
time these types of things come around
and happen again and welcoming all
things into your life also means
welcoming the things and owning the
things about you that maybe aren't your
favorite things owning your weaknesses
is a way to own who you are and in that
way you turn your weakness into a
strength
your weaknesses could be jealousy in a
way owning that
see acknowledging that jealousy and then
whenever you see yourself getting
jealous this is how I'm feeling right
now I'm not justifying it I'm just
saying I feel it and because I know that
I feel this way I'm able to use this as
my strength to work around it or to work
with that jealousy and find a way to
teach myself I don't need to be jealous
or to teach myself that there's
something bigger in life that I'm
missing because obviously if my jealousy
is still bubbling up and coming over
there's a big chunk of a life lesson
that I'm missing because otherwise this
feeling wouldn't be there and instead of
judging it and feeling like it's bad
turn it into a strength by learning from
it and making it something good and with
that you learn to trust everything
whether it's good or bad whether it's in
your life or just within yourself the
third tip when it comes to not doubting
yourself is to always do your best I
talked about The Four Agreements before
and I live very strongly by them more
than I even intended to it's just one of
those things that whenever I find myself
anxious or in any sort of situation that
I feel uncomfortable or I feel down I
read through the four agreements really
quickly in my head and always do your
best is one that sticks with me so
strongly if you're always doing your
best that's all anybody can ask of you
nobody can expect more including
yourself if you've put your all into it
and the thing is is that nobody knows
what your best is aside from you we have
to learn to trust ourselves and trust
when we know we're doing our best and
when we're maybe falling short or
letting other things get in the way or
being lazy because when we are honest
with ourselves we know when we're
actually doing our best then we're
confident enough to know that even if it
doesn't work out even if we fail we know
we did everything we could to the best
of our abilities so there's nothing to
feel wrong or doubtful about and this in
a lot of ways to kind of creates this
immunity to other people's opinions or
other people's judgments because no
matter what everybody's gonna have
something to say about everyone you
can't be everybody's cup of tea nobody's
gonna like everything you do someone's
can always find something to pick a part
about your personality about the work
you do about the things you say but the
person you are but the way to become
immune to that is to know that as long
as I'm just doing my best and I'm going
at everything with good intentions and
I'm putting myself out there to the best
of my abilities and expressing myself to
the best of my abilities and there's
nothing I can do to stop anyone from
judging me in a lot of ways it's their
right to judge me
I know that with doing my best I have
nothing else to prove and maybe it just
means that that other person and I don't
sink or that they see things through a
different perspective than I do you
learned just stop doubting yourself and
also in a lot of ways you learn to have
your own back because then you know I
know in my core this was the best that I
could have absolutely done so as fair as
it is for other people to pass judgment
my own judgment says you did the best
you could take it and learn from it or
take it and grow from it instead of
taking the opinions of others and
holding that to a higher value tip
number four when it comes to not
doubting yourself is the only way out is
through so something that was painted on
the wall once when I was doing yoga and
it confused the living crap out of me
because I'm sure that whole yoga class
and I was like what does that mean
though now that I've been getting back
into yoga back into meditation I hit
this moment of clarity but I remembered
that quote and I was like oh my god I
get what it means now like the only way
out is working through it can't run away
from it and you can't fight it you have
to work through it this line isn't just
for doubting yourself it's also really
good when it comes to feeling anxious
anytime I feel myself panicking or
getting anxious that anything if it's
social event if it's just something
that's stressing me out
I tell myself the only way out of this
is to work through it is to go straight
on headfirst right through it learn what
I need to learn put in the effort I need
to put in and walk away from it on the
other side rather than letting it fester
and procrastinate and sit here and
stress me out anymore when you don't
trust yourself when you doubt yourself
within your mind it tricks your brain
into thinking that you don't have
control over these situations that you
are just a living being that things are
happening to rather than you
progressively working forward living
forward and making things happen you
can't change where you're from whatever
is handed to you you have the option to
take it and do whatever you want with it
you can go this way with it you can go
that way but that you there's like a
million ways you can take every
situation and turn it into something
else so when you stop doubting yourself
and you start trusting yourself you see
the control that you have and taking all
situations and finding a way to turn it
into something good or find a way to
turn it into something to grow through
it's basically a trick of being
open-minded versus close-minded when
we're closed minded when we're shut down
when we're untrusting and when we're
doubtful we shut everything down we
don't walk that
we don't want that we're not worthy
we're not good enough but when we're
open-minded we see everything as you
know it doesn't matter whether I'm good
enough it doesn't matter why it's
happening it just matters what I'm gonna
do about it and the only way out is
through whether it's anxious thoughts
the only way out is to go through it I
have to feel anxiety I have to ask
myself what caused that I have to move
through it and I need to figure out how
can I make sure that this doesn't happen
again next time or what knowledge do
they gain from this for a future
experience that's gonna make me more
well equipped that time around and even
if things fail even if things are going
horribly wrong even if you get rejection
it's all just redirection and the only
way you're gonna move on and get past it
is to go right through it and and take
on the things that you're doubtful about
or afraid of head-on because once you do
that one it's never as scary as you
think it's gonna be and two we are all
more badass than we give ourselves
credit for it and we actually can handle
a lot more than we give ourselves credit
forward I can have a panic attack at the
bottom of a ski hill and still be a
badass okay because instead of falling
over breaking my leg and freaking out in
the middle of the hill I freaking bombed
down that hill avoided a tree avoided a
human working through it and getting to
the bottom of that hill was pretty
freaking badass or at least that's what
I'm telling myself tip number five is to
be your own best friend take care of
yourself don't just do your best
outwardly do your best inward as well
it's literally oh it's probably one of
the most important ones on this list
when you take care of yourself when you
make time for the things that you love
when you do things that you feel drawn
to when you trust your gut
you know you choose the beautiful over
the pizza or some nights when you're
having a bad day you choose the pizza
over the bootable when you just take the
utmost best care of yourself when you
have your own back when you're your own
best friend you gained such a
relationship within yourself and such a
trust within yourself that is almost
invincible and untouchable you have to
be confident you have to own who you are
and that doesn't give anyone the
permission to be boastful or to be rude
or to think that they're better than
anybody else taking care of yourself is
making it so that you're a happier
person that can then turn around and
take care of other people smiling at a
stranger and making them feel good being
able to turn off your own drama and be
there for a friend and give them life
advice
the more time you spend and make for
yourself to do things that make you feel
good
easier it is to feel good about other
things going on in your life maybe
things that are new to you or
challenging to you it's easier to feel
good about those things if you take your
spare time and you do things that make
you feel good about yourself so be your
own best friend take care of yourself
have your own back you know because if
you don't like nobody else can do that
for you it boils down to us to take care
of ourselves and to feel good about
ourselves so that we could turn around
and make other people feel good about
their selves number six and I hope you
guys don't take this too harshly cut the
crap or in the wise words of Jensen
chair Oh get your drama
honestly I put this one in here because
I had to do this to myself any given
situation we have two options we can be
the victim or we can be the master the
warrior I think that it's easy to want
to be the victim because in a lot of
ways victim mentality even if we don't
realize we're doing it and we all do it
it puts the responsibility on other
people to make us feel good to make us
feel loved to make us feel comfortable
or to justify the way that we feel and
something bad happens and you feel
doubtful about yourself you say like I'm
not good enough I'm ugly I'm this you're
kind of putting that responsibility on
other people to tell you that no you're
beautiful no you've got this no like
you're a great person and then you
become reliant on other people to make
you feel good and when that goes away
you're back into this victim mentality
instead you need to like cut the crap
and just not make everything seem like
such a big deal keep it light-hearted
make jokes out of things even when
you're feeling like absolute laughs
when you're having one of those days
where you're dropping your coffee and
you get pulled over and get a ticket and
you brake the sole on your shoe or you
burn some of your hair off with your
curling iron like just laugh about it
and don't make it such a big deal don't
make it such a dramatic thing it is
usually the main source as to why I feel
like I go through ruts and it's because
I get into these victim mentalities
where everything just feels like such a
personal attack from the universe or
from like the world I fall into that
light how dare that person cut me off or
like are you kidding me Starbucks raise
their prices again that was literally
the most basic girl thing I could have
ever said in my life but you know what
I'm saying nothing to feel ashamed of
because we all do it we all want to be a
victim a time or two because we all like
the idea of the fairy tale storyline
where someone
so long and saves the victims but I
don't want to be the victim I want to be
the warrior that's like you know
fighting through I don't need some man
to come save me or some person to make
me feel good or whatever it is I don't
want to be the damsel in distress and I
also don't want to be the hero like
nobody wants to be a martyr either let's
just like cut the drama of all of it
deal with what we need to deal with and
move on so that we can actually enjoy
our lives and feel good and relaxed and
not feel so you know like we're making
everything such a big deal taking
somebody else's life and contrasting it
against your own and then seeing your
own shortcoming putting expectations on
yourself or expectations and telling
yourself that you won't be or you can't
be happy unless you meet these
expectations this is all crap that we
torture ourselves with with for
literally no reason aside from I think
we kind of like the drama that I think
every now and then we all enjoy being
the victim we all enjoy being the hurt
or the angry in a way and I'm laughing
because it genuinely I genuinely think
it's kind of funny because I do it all
the time and and I catch myself doing it
or Greg will call me out on doing it and
I'm like yeah you're right like I'm
being a big baby right now for no reason
when you cut the crap when you cut the
drama when you stop comparing yourself
and you stop putting these silly and
ridiculous expectations on your life or
who you think you should be or whatever
it is it just makes it so much easier to
feel confident and to feel happy and to
stop doubting every situation and just
start enjoying it and my last and final
tip when it comes to not doubting
yourself and trusting your life is to
find something to believe it find
something that is bigger than who you
are and believe in that because even
when you follow through on all of the
tips that I just said sometimes it's
really hard to fight through that part
of your brain or fight through the
little devil on your shoulder so loud
and it's really hard to turn it down or
to beat through it or to fight it to
listen to the side of you that's more
trusting and more living by your heart
rather than living by your mind
sometimes it's really hard to turn off
our minds and to live by our hearts when
it comes down to those moments that
that's when we need to fall back on the
things that we believe it's something
bigger than ourselves to know that even
if this goes on for a couple more days
eventually I am going to start trusting
myself again and eventually I'm not
going to feel so doubtful and it's
because there's something bigger that's
playing a role in everything that's
happening
now let it be bigger than you let it
free you and let it make it so that even
on your darkest days you don't feel
alone there's something bigger that you
feel attached to there's something
higher that you feel drawn to a God or
the universe of the source or everything
happening for a reason or hakuna matata
or whatever it is that you choose to
believe in let that carry you through
those days because no matter what we all
have bad days we all have days where it
just feels so hard to try and fight
against the thoughts in our brain it
feels so hard to get out of that victim
mentality it's so hard to just not feel
defeated and not feel doubtful of the
whole situation of yourself of your life
but it's on those days that we need
those belief systems the most and to
remember that once you do work through
it and you start feeling confident and
you start trusting yourself in your life
again fall back on that belief system
with almost like a sense of gratitude as
lame as the sounds and as good she is
I'm getting right now don't forget to be
grateful for that and don't forget to be
grateful for the bigger picture of all
of this happening the fact that this
video exists the fact that you exist the
fact that I exist the fact that there's
seconds ticking by right now that
there's cars driving there's people
walking their dogs I'm literally just
naming things outside my window but all
of this is existing right now and even
just taking a solid second when you feel
good or even more so if you can find
gratitude when you feel doubtful I think
it almost lifts us up and brings us to a
higher sense of life and it secures us
there longer because it's showing that
we're doing our best so we're trying our
best to filter through all of the
thoughts and emotions and the things
that we are presented with and making
our intentions to focus on the light and
so there you guys have it I hope you
guys enjoyed today's coffee talk this
heated blanket is making me sweat in
areas I shouldn't be sweating you want
to come in my outro hope you guys enjoy
it I love you guys to the moon back and
we will see you guys on Sunday someone
made a request that I did this again so
here we go I sing to the pie
only two and the belly of bunny bathroom
