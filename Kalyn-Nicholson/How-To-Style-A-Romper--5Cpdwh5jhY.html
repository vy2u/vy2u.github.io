to be showing you three different ways
to style a romper I dressy way to style
a romper a casual way to style a romper
and last but not least a comfy way to
style a romper so all these rappers are
from Wet Seal and I'll leave all the
outfit descriptions and where you can
get a book view down below so let's get
started
starting with a dressy romper I decided
to go with black because you can always
just black up now this is a very bare
neck so I went with a bib necklace and I
thought that just this completed the
entire bumper look and really added a
little touch to the black and for shoes
you can never go wrong with heels heels
make everything look dressier so I threw
on just a little pair of gold heels
which looked so good with the gold and
that is really all you had to do to
spice up this little black romper this
is perfect for any little special event
going on this summer and it's so
flattering and so cute now to just a
romper a little bit more casual I
decided to go with a coral romper and
added a little pineapple necklace this
is perfect for like a day to day kind of
outfit and then I added some pretty
bangles if you look for detailing in
them as well and I find that this romper
is more so daytime because it's nice and
comfortable and then I added some
gladiator gold shoes for walking around
or whatever you're going to do that day
and then of course to make anything look
extra casual just add a little tied up
sweater or shirt or knit and this is
perfect if it tends to get chilly or
later on in the night so this obviously
completes the entire look making it look
super casual but still really real
cute and of course who doesn't want to
be comfortable so this gorgeous printed
romper is so pretty and so cute and the
fit of it is nice and loose and then I
just added a cardigan to make it extra
warm and cozy and comfortable and
sometimes no jewelry kind of bothers me
and I don't find it that comfortable to
have things dangling from me all the
time so no jewelry and I decided to go
with this really comfortable crochet
gladiator shoes and they match the
romper itself so that is just a really
easy way to make a romper more
comfortable and for everyday or just
hanging around the house so that was the
last one
so you hope this inspired you to try a
romper if you don't already love them
let me know what you look down below is
your favorite and I'll see you guys all
in a future video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
