image falling asleep watching The OC
first mistake and think it was around
like 3:30 it rolled over and I heard a
really loud noise and I was like oh god
it didn't look cracked in you know the
dark lighting of 3af so i went back to
sleep
happy as a bee and now this is what I'm
working with trying really hard not to
I'm ready
I've been an activist baby than any long
too long feeling great and I stayed I
thought we are my lady are you kidding
me is telling this is a sick joke okay
nothing is going to ruin this morning
coffee and we edit it all together
okay peel guys I just want to go grab my
laptop to re-edit yesterday's vlog oh
okay
today is actually a sick joke I deserve
this I have morning guys and welcome
back to my channel today's video was not
meant to be a blog well technically it
was kind of meant to be of law is
originally going to film like a super
chill relax like spring morning routine
so I woke up and I started filming just
that so I go to check and lo and behold
my video got a copyright claim which is
cool totally understandable probably
shouldn't have used blend by Drake but
like the temptation was so real ever no
big deal yet it's a video in my laptop
take the song out and re-upload the vlog
like where is my laptop oh yeah that's
right it's beside my bed where so last
night now here I am laptop and all I
know that this is going to be such a
first world problem thing but just to
add to the plate this bad boy popped up
last night okay the icing on the whole
cake if you watched the video I uploaded
two videos ago that WTF is going on
video you'll know that I was trying the
pill it was making me crazy all of that
fun stuff so I was just making me so
crazy that I was like I can't do this
anymore what do you think I woke up to
this morning if you're a lady I'm sure
you don't have to get that's my day
today when I said I was feeling better I
feel like whatever is up there whatever
creative this is testing that fairy so
I'm not going to let it get me down put
on comfy pants so take that guy in to
get it fixed
hopefully by today I'm going to fix the
copyright claiming yesterday's vlog and
I'm going to re-upload it by tonight
that is my plan as long as nothing
helps goes wrong today we should be good
so instead of this being a morning
routine it is now officially changed
into how to make the best out of the
worst day I've been reading books in
both the legends animates a kiddy sans
gold
okay lean tennis cares spider-man
control myself of torment I switch to
the darker jackets that they you know
take me a little bit more seriously
please need to tip number one when it
comes to having a bad day lean into the
bad day you're having I know I have a
pimple I know I feel like crap I know my
laptop smashed I know the video got a
copyright strike there's really no point
in me making it a bigger deal than it
needs to be a you just success that
that's what's going on kind of make the
most out of it you kind of make a joke
out of it makes it so much more easy to
tolerate we're all just having the ball
and
Oh
so I smashed my laptop screen last night
can get it fixed today because there's
just no way you need to use something
right now we can send it out get it you
know start getting repaired by some
excuse me Marlin return it when this
person what's the warranty for that it's
covered all the hardware the one your
digits I might as well buy a new laptop
Pat Kaelyn ka LAN life thank you
oh my
so let me tell you what you found I
could have spent a thousand dollars
fixing the screen and be without a
laptop for two weeks or the other option
was to buy a new laptop which is going
to cost me even more but I wouldn't have
to be with a lot of office two weeks and
I also just like didn't trust sending my
laptop out because dreamcatchers on here
and my videos on here all of my music is
on here little like I can't I didn't
back up dream catcher a backup engine I
can't do it I think a few people so I
bought a new laptop which also has more
storage so I kind of DOS it's like I
wasn't planning on spending that kind of
money today a little of thing so just to
recap real quick I needed more storage
on my laptop anyway so I'm kind of
trying to see it as a silver lining but
I didn't even have that laptop for years
so it's like low key very upsetting
rolling with it we're still leaning into
the bad day like I said silver lining is
I got a free Starbucks
she thinks I'm Taylor Swift I'm not I'll
be Taylor Swift for a day so I was
Taylor Swift buying that laptop today
would have meant nothing to my bank
account a broken dream tip number two
when you're having a bad day treat
yourself get yourself something that you
know is going to make you feel good like
a venti skinny cinnamon coconut milk
latte that made me sound so basic itself
ray just spilt that all over myself so
just add on to my days because I didn't
bring my headphones I have to head back
home to grab my headphones are we really
surprised of course I didn't bring my
headphones why did I just I don't that
was a terrible accent that's a lot going
to be a bumpy ride if my sister was here
she would be like this bad boy home and
introduce them to the family made a home
that's the day what I was setting up my
new laptop I ended up finding out that
for whatever reason my purchases like my
app purchases aren't showing up on my
iCloud which means I had to repurchase
and download Final Cut Pro which is the
video editing software that I used to
edit my videos and it's like four
hundred dollars I was on the phone with
Apple for like 45 minutes fighting with
them trying to figure out exactly where
the hell my Final Cut Pro went they
weren't going to reimburse me for it I
was like okay I can either freak out and
cry or I can just bite the bullet take
the loss and then go blow off some steam
at the gym thank God we saved the day
with getting the vlog back that was one
thing I was super worried about I ended
up going super pity party mode and like
feeling sorry for myself like you start
to get into those like mindsets where
the whole world is against you because
everything is going wrong but that my
friend is the big snooze if you've read
you are bad you'll know what I'm talking
about but usually that's always how it
goes it's like you go through ruts you
try and pull yourself out and like get
control of your life and that's usually
when all the bad things start to happen
so I'm rolling with it but it does lead
me to tip number three and that is to if
you're in a bad mood about it just get
it out of your system let yourself be a
little bit grumpy take a nap cry it out
what you got to do get it out of your
system my rule of thumb is never let
your pity party last longer than an hour
it shouldn't take up more than 4% of
your day take your nap be upset vent it
out to somebody do what you got to do
and then move on with the rest of your
day also it leads me to tip number four
and that is to go blow up some steam I
switched into some workout gear I'm
going to head downstairs to the gym
throw on some Bank B and I'm going to
blow off some serious steam
just kidding I'm back my gym is so full
there's so many people in there okay to
workout write some home which is also
beneficial for you guys because if you
guys are watching this and you're
wondering what workout this is I will
leave all of the things that I do down
below and this is technically an at-home
workout so silver lining the silver
lining today
so last is at least my final tip for you
guys when it comes to getting over a bad
day is to just go out and have a good
time grab a friend and go out and do
something fun at the end of the day a
really really bad habit of mine is
always hibernating when things go wrong
I go as fast as possible to my comforts
such as basically locking all my doors
putting on the biggest hoodie I have
ordering in some food and not answering
my phone for a solid 12 hours not only
leads to me waking up the next day kind
of feeling worse and having a back load
of text messages and emails to answer so
instead tonight is it up a friend we're
going to go up for dinner we're going to
split a bottle of wine we're going to
have some Italian food the end of the
day you got to let it go
or else it's just going to seep right
into tomorrow and we don't want that we
know nobody got time for that and my
bank account can not afford that let me
tell you so I am going to hit the shower
and dull myself up and head out for
dinner you're going to go to this place
called SIBO it's like a wine bar in
Toronto's amazing the Italian food there
is insane I get the mushroom salad and
it's like nothing I've ever tasted
before and that's just exactly what I
needed my life right now so thank you
guys so much for taking along with me
and hanging out with me on my bad day
already making me feel better before you
guys have even seen that you hung out
with me on my bad day and I hope that
you guys got some tips or some tricks or
if you just got entertained from this
that's all that really matters be sure

guys like to do on your bad days Bentley

bad day and also if you guys have any

that I'm going to leave you guys here I
