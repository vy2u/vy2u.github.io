in my life beautiful light
this is a declaration of my soul
possession hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm going to be fulfilling and a
requested video on how to theme at your
Instagram except this is going to be the
fall edition lately one of the biggest
questions I've been getting on my
Instagram is how have I been deeming it
what filter am I using what are my tips
and tricks I figured I would go ahead
and fill one of these videos again since
I have some updated tips that I'm using
this year and obviously you guys don't
see it otherwise you wouldn't be asking
if you guys aren't following me already
be sure to check out my Twitter and my
Instagram come check it out you guys are
gonna be hearing a lot about my
Instagram obviously in this video I am
like full fledge fall mode on my
Instagram right now that's said before
we even dive it into this video let me
make a disclaimer that you do not need
to seem your Instagram you don't need to
have like a plan or a formula or a
filter or a theme whatever you don't
have to do this is just if you want to
do this that said also if you do want to
theme your Instagram if you do find this
stuff interesting if you do get a sort
of giddiness out of seeing a very nicely
displayed feed then there's also nothing
wrong with that too so if you guys want
to know what my tips and tricks when it
comes to theming your Instagram for the
fall time then just keep watching you
have number one when it comes to theme
your Instagram has come up with your
colors now you can go from your favorite
color colors that you tend to wear a lot
colors that you tend to be surrounded by
or wherever you tend to take most of
your pictures my colors for my current
Instagram theme are like black white
grey with a pop of orange not just any
orange but like a burnt cinnamon orange
and I like to keep my Instagram theme
more blue-hued a little bit on the
cooler temperature side which makes the
oranges pop even more that time you guys
can choose any colors you could choose
bourbon these army greens you could
choose black white and orange for
Halloween you could choose yellow and
red and orange for leaves you could do
more warmer tones since it is fall
there's literally an infinite amount of
colors you guys could come up with when
you have similar colors popping up in
all of your photos it makes the female
your Instagram is that much easier to
pop with some colors that you like
we're some colors that you know if you
like searched through we heart it or
tumblr other people's instagrams and
I'll even go as far as wearing like an
orange outfit to an event so that I know
it's gonna go well on my feet yes I know
it's a little crazy but I love to plan I
love to organize and I like to you know
have everything it sounds weird but it's
just who I am as a person tip number two
when it comes to theming at your
Instagram is to come up with your
content what kind of photos do you want
to be posting for me I like to post
fashion I like to post pictures of my
dog I like to post coffee I like to post
events that I'm going to I like to post
my wife right I like to post my friends
those are all things that hold very true
to who I am and true to my life but
they're also content that I kind of
already have in mind when it comes to
posting the Instagram you can literally
make this anything if you are a traveler
if you like really good quotes you could
break up your photos with quotes if
you're into photography you can go
around and find cool like city
photography you could do fashion
photography you could do there's just an
infinite amount of content that you can
post to your Instagram as long as it's
authentic to who you are and it's a form
of you expressing your innermost self as
superlame as that sounds
post your life during the moment take
photos of things that you're enjoying
and post that which leads me to tip
number three and that is to come up with
your formula this is my favorite part
last year my formula was way more
complicated than this year it was like
overhead shoes far away photo overhead
shoes it was like something crazy like
that this year I decided to make it a
little bit easier it should I wanted off
photos that I'm in them and out of them
so like I said if you're into quotes you
could make your formula be a photo a
quote if you're doing colors you can
make your formula have black and white
and non black and white you can come up
with so many kinds of formulas and I
think that this is the part that even if
people use similar filters even if
people have similar content this can be
the thing that differentiates one person
from another person makeup and food you
could do so many different formulas so
come up with a fun formula for uploading
start posting in that general order and
you'll notice that once you start to
look at your Instagram everything starts
to flow a little nicer tip number four
is to find your filter I'm gonna post a
ton of really great filters down below
that are great for autumn mine will and
forever problem
we'll be hb2 I'm still using the same
one the only difference is as I play
around with the colors a little bit more
I'll sometimes adjust the exposure the
contrast highlights shadows saturation
temperature tint skin tone and then I
fade so that's a lot of you know moving
things around but once you do it once
you can actually copy the edits and then
paste them on all your other photos and
if you use the same filter and all of
the same editing tools on every single
photo with a little bit of change based
on the lighting of the original photo
then all of your content will look
exactly the same on your Instagram this
is going to be the trick that actually
brings the theme because obviously if
you're using the formula and the colors
there's going to be a little bit of a
theme but if you're using the exact same
filter on every single photo then your
whole Instagram is gonna be like a mini
portfolio of your life so I'll write out
my exact filter down below since I know
that is a highly highly asked question
that I got to be posting in bunch of
other filters down below that are great
for a fall feed and another quick tip is
you can actually open up Pinterest and
type in like fall Instagram themes and
it'll come up with visco filters as well
as they think there's a couple other
apps that people might use to edit their
photos I obviously use vsco cam what I
didn't even mention that but if you type
it on Pinterest like Instagram themes or
fall Instagram themes it'll come up with
a bunch of options for you with all the
little editing in between tip number
five is to get a planning app I use the
app on um you and um and this happens
free and that's why I use it I'm not
being sponsored nothing in this video is
sponsored and this is actually the
hugest trick that I use to make sure
that everything is appealing to the eye
because even if you follow all of the
other tips sometimes things can fall off
balance I know it sounds like I'm taking
my Instagram very seriously but I have a
lot of fun with it okay so you can
upload all of your photos before they
ever see Instagram and you can check how
it's actually gonna look on your feed
and setting reminders for yourself to
tell you when to post and it gives you a
lot more time to come up with a caption
because we all know how hard it is to
come up with a caption on demand and
then last but not least start posting
like I mentioned before even if you're
using all these tips stay outside you to
who you are stay authentic to your life
and do yourself justice by posting what
you like and what you want to see and
not what you
and anybody else wants to see social
media can be you know this trick we're
play into believing that our instagrams
and our social medias are a good
indication of what our lives are
actually like and they're not I think if
you take it with a grain of salt if you
look at it it's a way to express
yourself and you have fun with it but
you also stay true and real and knowing
that in a way it's all an illusion then
that's the only way you can actually
have fun with it without making it a
source of your own self work don't try
and be somebody else don't try it and
post what you think people want to see
because that's the sort of one way too
much weight on yourself based on what
your Instagram or your social media is
and - it's gonna suck all the fun out of
it I've done with it
be true to yourself and if all else
fails you know what screw all these tips
don't use any of them and just post
whatever you really do want to post
because at the end of the day it's not
about the life we post it's about the
life that we actually live so those are
all of my tips for theming your
Instagram for the fall time I hope you
guys enjoyed if you guys have any tips
to add be sure to comment them down
below as always and other than that I
love you guys coming back and I will see
you guys all in my next video bye guys
look at you I see myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
