back to my channel for today's each our
video we're going to be talking all
about getting that perfect Instagram
feed for the fall tab and yes I know
it's kind of like cringy hearing that
because how basic can we get but do it
make happy and you know photography
makes me really happy and Instagram
makes me really happy and I like having
a really cool Instagram feed for the
full time so without further ado let's
jump in I just wanted to make that basic
girl disclaimer as you guys probably
know especially if you've been following
me for a very long time now fall it's my
favorite freaking time of year I don't
know what it is it just speaks to my
soul and every single year it's like the
only time that my Instagram feed seems
to figure itself out which if you want
to follow me already I'll leave my
Instagram and my Twitter right here on
the screen come check out all my fault
autos because not only am i posting a
bunch to my Instagram right now I'm also
doing a tweet tober on my Twitter where
I post a picture every single day for
the month of October but with that said
I obviously have a bit of a method going
in terms of taking really awesome cute
fall photos so if you guys want to know
what my Instagram formula is and my tips
and tricks we're taking some awesome
photos and the fall times then just keep
watching so let's start out with my
Instagram formula I recently came up
with a formula for uploading to
Instagram and yes I know you do not need
at all to put this much thought into
your Instagram but as I said it makes me
happy on my Instagram there's a certain
way I upload each photos so the formula
is as follows
one is some sort of overhead photo
whether it be you know an outfit and
shoes or it be some sort of overlay
second is a full-body photo so this
could either be you know if I'm at an
event or I'm doing something really fun
like apple picking or if I'm trying to
show off whatever outfit I'm wearing
picture number three is usually a selfie
or some sort of close-up photo I'm taken
with my DSLR I'm doing some sort of blog
post or anything
like a close-up hood photo I'm actually
like low-key kind of dying at how vain
this video seems and we're forward is
back to being full body whether it be a
outfit or an event or whatever I'm doing
photo number five is something that kind
of creates the mood I'm feeling that
week so this is usually like some sort
of detailed photo some ideas of this
could be I have like pictures of Bentley
pictures of you know pumpkins um a cute
like lot a photo a photo of you know the
trees outside all different color
moody's sort of photography will go in
the fifth slot and then number six is
repeat so go right back to the shoes
overlay so there you have it that is the
Instagram upload formula that I use like
I said I put a lot of thought and effort
into my Instagram but it makes me happy
so if you're somebody that likes to do
the same sort of thing or wants to do
the same sort of thing feel free to use
my formula I'll type it out down below
as for tricks hacks and tips for coming
up with a really killer Instagram feed
this fall number one is to follow a
theme and by following a theme I mean
you know pick one filter and kind of
play around with that filter and then
use that same filter on every single
photo and if you guys are wondering what
my filter is this fall I use HB - I put
the highlights up by three I'll
sometimes turn the saturation down it's
super super colorful that will turn the
tint up - and then I'll fade it out by
three so that is the current filter and
theme I have going on my Instagram right
now darker gloomy or fall kind of like a
bit of a brown tinge to it so there's a
bunch of really awesome filters I'll pop
up on the side here that also look
really really good for a fall feed so
definitely play around with filters I
use vsco cam but you can also use like
after light especially with the upload
formula you're going to be like whoa I
definitely don't have my life figured
out but my Instagram will trick you into
thinking I do there's some other great
tips for getting some really awesome
photos this fall is to find some sort of
diversity but keep one to two things the
same whether that be like a similar
color like I like to try and pop a
little bit of orange in every photo
somewhere for the fall time and if not
then usually there's like a green or a
yellow usually the fall time my outfits
have some sort of black in them so that
always kind of coincides in each of the
photos get creative with it if you're
super into photography which is why I
get so you know nerdy about this kind of
stuff but try and kind of
recreate that mood or that idea in your
head into a photo I can look back on my
Instagram and remember the type of mood
or feeling I was having based on trying
to kind of recreate that mood in a photo
that probably sounds super weird but
it's just I was creeping my Instagram
from last fall just last night and it's
like I look at it and I'm instantly
brought back to the mindset I had then
what was going on in my life then like I
just remember every little detail based
on how much I put tiny little thoughts
into the photos that was posting it
makes the whole coming up with photos
way more fun and like authentic and
original because you know you're
creating something based on how you're
feeling not based on what you saw on
like tumblr or something there's someone
that likes to post outfit photos another
great tip is to come up with one go to
wall there's this limestone wall that I
really like to use and I always go there
if I just need a quick outfit photo but
I don't really know exactly where to
take it another really awesome tip is to
have your go-to poses so that by the
time that I go out with my brother to go
take these photos I already know what my
angles are and my last few tips are to a
use shade shade is your best friend B
get somebody to take some of your photos
for you like I said I brought my little
brother and he's really good at it and
three you know have fun with it it's
really cool that we have things like
social media to really express ourselves
and if we don't use those social
platforms to really show who we are and
instead we're just trying to mimic
everything else and everybody else then
we're never going to really fully get to
enjoy it we're going to constantly be
comparing and not feeling good enough so
the way I like to look at Instagram and
Twitter and all of these things is to
not really pay so much mine to what
everybody else is doing and just show
off you what are you into what do you
like whatever it is just show off the
different sides of yourself that fall
tends to bring out or if you're watching
this at any point in the year some are
spring Christmastime anything like that
show off the parts of you that you know
this time of year pulls from you which
also leads me to the point that if you
guys have any really awesome tips for
getting a cute and awesome Instagram
feed for the fall time then be sure to
leave them down below I hope you guys
enjoyed this video finding out what my
fall theme is as well as just the tips
and tricks that I like to use and other
than that I will see you guys all in
tomorrow's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
