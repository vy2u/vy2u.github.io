begging and begging for a sit-down and
talk video I'm here I'm sitting and I'm
ready to start talking hey guys so for
today's video we are talking about a bit
of a heavier topic ever since I did my
We Need to Talk video it has been so
highly requested to do a video all about
breakups now just to give you guys like
a little background as to where I'm
coming from with this advice one I am
absolutely no love expert um I've been
broken up with I've done the breaking up
I've been through mutual breakups I have
someone long-distance some were like
really long relationships like over in a
span of a few years some of them were
just over the span of a few weeks or
months some of them have been guys that
I like literally thought I wouldn't be
able to be without and some of them have
been guys where I was just kind of like
okay well I mean happens right so I
like that's the experience I'm coming
from when I give you guys just what has
helped me and my personal advice but if
there is anything that you think I'm
missing in this video or if you guys
have any two cents to put in feel free
to leave it down below
okay so let's jump in and I'm going to
start with one of the most important
things you can tell yourself or you can
tell a friend or anyone that's going
through a breakup there is this line
from Grey's Anatomy and it wasn't
necessarily during a breakup scene but
it was through Cristina and Meredith and
this is such this is a huge thing at the
like anytime my friends were upset about
boy or anytime I'm even upset about a
boy use this line and it's like
instantly it just completely changes you
and Cristina looks at Meredith and says
he is not the son he is great but he's
not the son so no matter how in love you
might think you are with somebody or how
amazing they may seem or great they may
seem or perfect to you that they may
have seemed they are not the son you do
not revolve around this person they are
not the most amazing magnificent person
on earth though they might be a great
awesome person they are not the only
great and awesome person here so get it
out of your head that you cannot live
without this person because it is so
beyond untrue you don't need them to
give you your source of life so the
minute that you realize that that they
are not the son you do not need them
they are not your source they are not
your reason for being here that is going
to make the rest
this so much easier it's going through a
breakup when you're losing somebody it
can feel like like you're losing that
sense of who you are and especially if
you've been dating for a very very long
time but keep in mind that they are not
the be-all and end-all to who you are
and it's such a powerful feeling for
yourself when you come to realize that
that you are the son when it comes to
your own life you are the son they are
not so let's start with that one and I
just feel like that's a really really
great point to make before moving into
the next points because it's going to
make the rest of this so much easier so
for number two its to throw yourself
into something and I'm not telling you
to like distract yourself while I mean
distraction can certainly help the more
you just distract yourself with kind of
aimless things the more it's just going
to hit you later on when you have
nothing left to distract yourself with
so I'm saying throw yourself into
something productive do something that's
going to make you feel like you are
succeeding this could be something
you've already been working on this
could be something completely new and if
you have no earthly idea what you could
do then
honestly the options are endless you
could you know sign up to run a marathon
and start training for it or sign up for
hot yoga and start going or decide you
want to start a YouTube channel and just
start working on it or get into arts and
crafts or anything like that there is
literally a billion things on this earth
that you could do there is no reason to
sit around and be like and there's
nothing I can do there are so many
things who do learn an instrument start
cooking get really healthy or start
focusing on something that's going to
make you feel a productive and to like
you're succeeding at something because
that feeling is completely irrelevant to
your breakup in your relationship and
because it's going to give you that
feeling of success or that feeling of
like wow like I did something I've
accomplished something it is going to
make you feel really really good I'm not
saying that it's going to make you feel
any less shitty about your breakup but I
am saying it's going to make you feel a
lot better about yourself and who you
are and just a side note not that you're
looking to jump into a new relationship
but doing things for yourself and
working on yourself as an individual is
such an attractive quality as much as
you want to sit around and cry and be
upset and I'm not telling you not to
have your little cry fest but don't let
it last forever because honestly the
best thing you can do is to put your
mind and your focus and all of that
energy whether it be good energy
energy whatever energy you have towards
that relationship throw it all into this
new project and you're going to feel a
really good about yourself and B it's
going to start giving you the momentum
to continue to move on with your life
which kind of leads me in to tip number
three and it's gonna sound super cliche
I already know this but it is to focus
on yourself even if at first it is just
to like
get back get that a little revenge I
mean we all do it we go through a
breakup you're like you know what I'm
gonna work out I'm gonna get hot and
they're going to be so upset that they
left me behind whatever if that is your
drive to start then just let it be your
drive let revenge drive you at first I'm
not telling you not to
I'm not we're going to sit here and
pretend that you know life is perfect
and that oh don't do it because of
revenge like honestly that's a really
really good fuel for your fire because
it might start off as being revenge you
know going to the gym eating healthy and
like traveling and all this stuff making
yourself look like look I'm fine without
you
yeah it might start out as you try to
kind of get revenge or to try and kind
of make that person miss you but as you
continue to do these things you're going
to start realizing that eh
all of a sudden you don't really care if
they miss you anymore because B you've
been focusing on yourself and it makes
you feel good this is like the perfect
time to kind of reinvent yourself and
and really focus and crack down and
honestly if there's any better time to
do it it's right after a breakup because
you've got a fresh wound any sort of
momentum that's going to get you to
start doing these things it's something
like lick pain pain is a very very
powerful force if you can use that pain
to you know push yourself to start
working on you and focusing on you I
can't even explain to you how much
better that's going to start making you
feel so not only just focus on doing
something productive and doing that
project like in tip number two but in
tip number three then let that kind of
have the domino effect of the rest your
life start spending more time with
family you know there's like really
improve on who you are and start being
the person that you want to be and start
being better than who you were yesterday
and all of those really awesome cliches
which then it leads me to tip number
four and this is to lean on you know
your squad and really start forcing
yourself and I know it's going to you're
really just going to want to become a
hermit and not leave your house
especially if you are completely
heartbroken force yourself to get out
get out make plans with friends ask your
friends
to come over if you really really don't
feel like leaving but I'm telling you if
you get up and you dress up and you put
on like something hot and you go outside
your house even if it's to go grab the
freaking mail it's going to make you
feel better than sitting around in
sweatpants and I'm telling you that from
experience even if you're not somebody
that likes to you know like vent out
your problems or talk about your
problems or cry with people because I
may or may not know exactly how that
feels lean on them in terms of asking
them to you know guys can can you make
some plans with me and like keep me a
little bit busy because though I told
you not to distract yourself as long as
you're still working on like a
successful project and focusing on
yourself in general then in the meantime
when you're not working on those things
feel free to distract yourself and
especially if you have a good group of
friends that are really positive and
make you feel good about yourself and
there's absolutely no reason why they
wouldn't be there for you and let you
like lean on them because when they go
through it you're gonna be right there
to do it right back to that go for
drinks go have some fun
hit up a dance floor and then a tip
number five and this is going to be for
those times where you're sad and you're
alone and you're by yourself and there's
nothing to distract you and you're not
like doing anything productive normally
this is like two o'clock in the morning
when you can't sleep remind yourself why
it didn't work out and I mean maybe you
thought for for whatever reason that it
was going to work out so you don't have
a reason then remind yourself why they
may have said it wasn't going to work
out if it's even worse and you thought
it was going to work and they didn't
really give you a reason then tell
yourself this do you really want to
minimize yourself to being with somebody
who doesn't want to be with you or isn't
excited to be with you because you could
be in love with the most amazing person
on earth but if they don't want to be
with you they don't deserve you and I'm
just telling you the goddamn truth you
should not ever have to force anyone to
want to be with you you are an amazing
person on your own and I know it's gonna
be easier said than done and of course
you're still going to want that person
but you don't need that person you do
not need to be with anybody that you
have to force into being with you
because if they can't see how great you
are do you really want to spend your
life with somebody like that like
personally for me I would rather feel
the heartbreak you know focus on myself
get through it and then wait for the
right person that is just as excited to
be with me as I am to be with
or the little things that whatever X
didn't like about me they find cute and
quirky and so try and remind yourself
that when you're really really sad at
night and you're really feeling the loss
of this person why it didn't work out or
why they say it didn't work out or if do
you really want to be with somebody who
doesn't want to be with you okay and
then tip number six this has been such a
big thing from you guys you have no idea
and it's to call upon your alter ego we
can't always be you know strong awesome
badasses all the time so if you give
yourself an alter ego then every time
you're feeling weak or like you don't
want to do it and you have absolutely no
drive to pick yourself up off the ground
giving yourself an alter ego you call
upon them and then they come in and they
kick ass for you and I'm not saying this
just in terms of breakups this is
actually something Meggie and I did a
few months back I would say it was about
January her and I were talking about
like who our favorite like famous people
are or like people in movies or TV shows
and if we could be anyone who would be
beat we're both pretty introverted
people so every time we would go out we
would have a pre jam and be like you
know what
we are not Kaylin and Maggie tonight we
are alter egos and we would go out and
we would just have so much fun because
our alter egos a didn't give a crap B
were way more badass than our normal
cells and see like it just they just
they had fun they were different they
weren't introverted they were
extroverted and your alter ego can have
all of the qualities that and
characteristics that maybe you feel you
don't have but you want because if you
make that your alter ego and every time
you're feeling like crap or every time
you don't really feel it or you know you
don't want to get up and go out and do
things or you're just feeling super weak
and like you want to call this person or
you want to text this person reach out
to them call upon your alter ego your
alter ego is going to come in and give
you a little bit of a life lesson and
kick you in the butt and be like no and
we don't care about this person anymore
because they didn't care about us and
speed you were way too good for this
person and see let's go dance like let's
go do something let's throw on some
Taylor Swift let's dance around the
apartment let's have a good time and
even aside from breakups when you do
this enough um your alter ego kind of
stops being your alter ego and it kind
of just starts being you in a different
side of you and I mean since January I
have felt like so different when I call
upon my alter ego and it has really
changed my life and created a lot of
really cool
experiences for me that I don't think I
would have had had I not called upon my
alter ego so guys are probably all
wondering who my alter ego is now but
you know what it's my own little
personal thing so maybe one day I'll
tell you but for now she's gonna remain
a secret and then last but not least is
tip number seven and it is to reinvent
yourself this is the perfect time coming
fresh out of a relationship that you may
be defined yourself by or thought that
it was going to be this person you were
going to be for the rest your life or
maybe you felt like you had your life
plan move cut your hair try something
new go traveling freaking sky dive read
new books try out new music try out new
food like start running again and I know
this is kind of like counting into like
some of the other tips that I said but
just all-in-all reinvent yourself and
try new things and put yourself out
there and that is going to be probably
one of the hardest things to do after a
breakup typically after we go through
any sort of pain we want a withdrawal we
want to like seclude ourselves into our
shells and that's possibly one of the
worst things you could do I'm not saying
that you shouldn't at all I'm saying
that if you need to have a good cry then
girl have a good cry and if you need to
be upset for a few days maybe even a few
weeks I'm not here to judge you do it
but just don't forget to pick yourself
back up and then use that momentum to
completely reinvent yourself as I
continue to talk about this point I'm
really realizing how similar it is to a
lot of the other points that I already
mentioned but I just feel like it's
probably the most important out of all
of them it's to focus on yourself
because you are worth so much more than
any person that didn't see the good new
or if you're the one that did the
breaking up and you're still feeling the
heartbreak then you need to give worth
to what you just did and really go out
there and really live life to the
fullest like honestly sometimes we can
get so wrapped up and all of the layers
of things going on in our life that we
often forget how short our time is here
on earth personally for me I know ever
since I put up that we need to talk
video that was me closing a massive
chapter in my life where I officially
decided I wasn't going to let things
take up my time anymore and take up my
energy because my life and my time is
just way too goddamn short I know it's
so much easier said than done
heartbreak is absolutely excruciating
type pain but how long and how much time
are you willing to invest in feeling
this way for this person because I'm
telling you you might not feel it and
maybe you're not willing to tell
yourself or maybe nobody said it to you
so I'm here to say to you have no idea
what's in store for you I'm promising
you there are amazing things coming in
your leg and you are the your blinders
are on so you can't see it yet none of
us really can trust me when I say
there's going to come a day we're going
to look back on this and realize how
needed and crucial this part of your
life was to like kind of kind of pulled
you into something so much better and
much more amazing and you are going to
be so happy and you're going to feel
good about yourself and you're going to
feel like this person you were always
meant to be as much as you may not feel
like that is coming and telling you it
is and I'm not saying that that means
you're going to find someone better
because you know what maybe you're just
going to be better on your own so maybe
you're going to feel better in a year
maybe you're going to feel better in a
few months maybe a few weeks maybe a few
years but I'm telling you what is coming
is better than what has just passed and
you just got to keep that in mind and
keep that as your main focus in your
forefront thought because as long as you
can keep it focusing on that and I'm not
saying you're not going to fall off and
get upset and kind of feel that
heartbreak again but every time you fall
down don't forget to get back up like
please please please get back up because
you have so much more strength in you
than you know and you guys are so much
more badass and you guys give yourself
credit for and that is that goes for all
of us so that's my that's my huge life
speech for you guys today so I hope this
lifts up to your guys's expectations in
terms of making a video all about
heartbreak and breakup if there's
anything you guys think I may have
forgotten again be sure to leave it down
below to any of you guys watching this
that are going through breakup I am

good energy in hopes that you will make
it through let me know down below what
