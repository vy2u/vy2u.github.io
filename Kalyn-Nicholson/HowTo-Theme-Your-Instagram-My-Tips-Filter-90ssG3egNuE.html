to tell but I've had a lot of caffeine
today I'm talking four cups coffee I've
been up since 6:00 a.m. I could not
sleep this morning so I have four cups
of coffee I just keep making it and
making it and I needed my decaf and I
totally haven't bought a new cap yet so
the quiche I just keep making the
caffeinated ones and yeah that's the
reason why I'm so hyped up right now but
that means this videos gonna be really
fun hey everyone so for today's video I
am doing the highly highly highly highly
requested video on my Instagram or how
to theme your Instagram or how I take my
Instagram photos or how I add them in
all of that fun stuff this has been
requested for a very very long time and
I haven't done one of these in like I
think it's been over a year now so for
starters let's go down with the obvious
and if you aren't following me already I
will put links right here to my Twitter
and Instagram today I'm going to share
with you guys like my camera and my
iPhone and just a bunch of tips and like
little things that you can do in terms
of like photography or theme in your
Instagram and all of that fun stuff
just like there's a little bit of a
disclaimer like I just I feel like I
feel it's a necessary thing for me to
just say this that I mean the value of
who you are is not based on your image
or your Instagram and I just want to say
that just to start off this video
because though like themeing your
Instagram and photography it can all be
so fun I just feel like maybe in this
day and age we put a little bit too much
you know value into like what your
Instagram is like or how cool your life
looks on the internet and all that stuff
and like I don't know I just feel like
that should be a good disclaimer to
start with before jumping into this
video because by all means you do not
have to theme your Instagram you don't
have to even try to insert like you
don't have to do any of this stuff it's
just fun it makes the whole Instagram
game so much more fun when you know
you're just doing it for fun you're not
doing it for like validation so now that
we got that part of the way let's jump
in to all the good stuff okay so for
starters I for my Instagram I would say
I usually take a lot of my Instagram
photos on my DSLR camera so because I'm
wondering what
right I have it is the canon 70d and the
lens I have on it is a sigma lens I'm
not exactly sure what lens it is but I
will leave it in the description box
down below but yeah so this is the
camera that I normally it's the camera
I'm shooting on right now or else I
would be showing you guys but that is
the camera that most of my pictures are
taking on sometimes I will take like if
I need a little bit more of a wide-angle
photo I will take the photos with my
other lens it's just the lens that I
bought with the Canon camera itself and
I believe it's like an 85 135 millimeter
but again I am not a hundred percent
sure so I will leave it down below how
many let's go look I'm gonna say a good
90% of my photos were taken with my
canon that said you do not need like a
fancy camera to step up your Instagram
game iPhones and Samsung's they tend to
have really really really good cameras
on them you by no means do not need to
have a really really nice camera you can
always just use yourself on camera so
yeah I just get that question a lot so I
figured I would touch on which camera
that I do use so now you guys know okay
so next umm tips in terms of taking your
Instagram photos so a lot of people
always ask like oh who takes your photos
for you and a majority of the time
Maggie does um my best friend slash old
roomie she is a gem she freaking helps
me with so many videos and so many
pictures you have no idea so shadow two
Meg's
she usually takes a lot of my Instagram
photos or if she doesn't another thing I
do is I use my tripod really really easy
and I just well because I have a tripod
for filming again I would show you but
I'm using it right now hope you can put
a camera on self-timer or I have my
camera hooked up to my phone so
sometimes I can check what the photo is
going to look like before I take it and
then I'll take it on my phone or just in
general when I'm out and about if I like
want to take an outfit photo or from
doing something fun or anything like
that I'll just ask Mike whoever I'm what
to take one for me and then some tips
are actually taking photos one of my
favorite things to do is to put things
in the third so if you don't know what
that means is like we're looking at this
whole screen right now if you were to
split this into three parts so like
three equal parts is probably isn't
equal it's um basically what you
put the subject of your photo whether
you or whether it be like your taking a
picture of like flowers or whatever
you're taking a photo of put it in the
one of the thirds so like I would put it
where this arm is or I would put it with
this arm is if that makes any sense at
all you can do it this way too but
that's just one of my favorite things
I've noticed that on my Instagram I tend
to do that a lot I'll put things kind of
off off-center a little bit and I just I
really really like that so that gives it
a good balance to like if you are
posting a lot of photos and filling up
your feed with a lot of things sometimes
always having things dead center kind of
I don't know it makes things a little
bit more boring another one is exposure
you're going to want to get as much
light and natural light as you can when
it comes to taking photos daylight is
always your best bet so as much daylight
as you can especially if you're going to
be taking any sort of like selfies or
anything try and go in front of like a
window don't don't do direct sunlight
that's another really good tip is you
never want to have like direct sunlight
on your subject whether it began you or
an object because direct sunlight it'll
usually wash you out all that fun stuff
so you kind of want to get like shade
but sunlight like if that makes any
sense so like right in front of like a
window like I'm filming in front of my
window right now but there's no direct
sunlight so the lighting ends up being
usually pretty good and one thing I
recently learned that you can do on an
iPhone and when you're taking a photo is
to hold your thumb on the subject and it
will lock your focus into place and then
not only that once you do that you can
scroll your finger up and down to affect
the exposure so if you're taking a photo
of something and it kind of looks dark
hold your thumb on it and then you'll
see this little Sun show up and then
just move the Sun up and it'll lighten
up the exposure of the photo which is
then going to just make it a little bit
easier when you take it to go edit and
speaking of exposure I find too if you
are trying to theme your Instagram it's
best to try and make sure that the
lightness of your photos is usually
generally the same like you're not
really taking like a really dark exposed
photo and then like your next one is
kind of a little bit lighter so when
you're taking photos try and kind of
keep that in mind and make sure that all
the lighting all the lighting in general
and like the exposure of all of your
photos is kind of unasyn because it's
going to make your like your theme look
a lot better so then another good idea
when it comes to
in your Instagram to is to kind of keep
either your backgrounds or your content
sort of similar it doesn't have to be
like the exact same like if you're
taking photos of like the same object
you don't have to do the exact same
object in every single photo but like
it's kind of good to come up with a
style or a theme or whatever it is like
if you take a lot of fashion photos or
if you take a lot of like if you're more
like a lifestyle person you want to like
post a lot of different things and try
and kind of keep a similar color scheme
if that makes sense that way when you go
to put like filters and stuff on them
it'll be so much easier for you to theme
and it's going to like it'll just look
better you know what I mean so you don't
have to do all of those three things
together but if you are going to be
theming your Instagram a good thing to
keep in mind is either taking photos of
similar content taking photos with
similar backgrounds not all the same but
like they all kind of like you know
coincide or match each other or taking
photos with similar color schemes in the
photos so like that could be black and
white it could be taking a lot of like
purples and blues which is something I
normally stick to a day and now for the
fun part
it's editing so I use vsco cam I get
asked that a lot like what app or
whatever it is that I use for my filter
honestly I think the funnest part about
Instagram is kind of coming up with like
your own like styles so by all means
feel free to use my filter I believe
exactly what filter I use down below but
a really really good idea is to go on
Instagram there's a couple Instagram
accounts where if they show you like
different types of filters so what I did
for my Instagram is I kind of went
through one of those Instagram accounts
and kind of kept on taking a bunch of
photos that I generally would post to my
Instagram unfiltered putting them into
fiscal cam and then trying out all of
these different filters until I kind of
found one that I felt fit my style and
also looked good with the type of
content of photos that I took the
amazing thing about vsco cam is that
there is like an infinite amount of ways
you can edit your photos so like you can
make your photos really light really
dark really colorful black and white all
of that fun stuff there's so many
filters
I'm normally upload a photo
and one of the first things I like to do
is crop it if it isn't already so I'll
crop it to a square so I know it'll fit
and then the filter I've been using is I
will scroll over into E so I use e 8
and then I'll usually brighten up the
saturation by 2 and then from here if
the photos a little dark I will lighten
it or darken it anything like that and
sometimes too I will warm up the
temperature if it's just a little bit
too blue so that is the filter that I
use on my photos and yeah so I've been
asked that a lot
so that is my most recent filter and the
filter I have been using the kind of
theme my Instagram recently and then a
couple s tips for the road if you are
someone that is trying to like kind of
theme your Instagram or have a little
bit more fun with it a few tips to keep
in mind are one if you're getting
somebody to take the photos for you ask
them to take a bunch more is better and
not only that tell them to take some
Kodak's you know like don't be afraid to
kind of be like ok I'm just going to
kind of goof around a little bit and you
just keep taking photos half the time no
that's a lie like 90% of the time they
all end up terrible but you know what
there's that odd time you get a good
Kodak moment where you're like flipping
your hair you're laughing or doing
something or anything like that so also
don't be afraid to play around with some
angles I like to do a lot of above shots
umm sometimes you kind of get like a
side angle or anything like that you can
really play around with angles and I
also find it is super helpful when
anyone's taking like an outfit photo to
ask them to drop low I find when you ask
the person to drop low it makes you look
really like tall and like your limbs
just look so long and stuff so yeah cuz
I swear to god I get asked all the time
how tall am I feel like you guys think
that I might be a lot taller than I
really am I'm honestly very average
height I'm 5 5 so I look a lot taller
than my photo so because of the trick of
asking people to drop low and then my
last and final one is a really really
good one for selfies um one little trick
that I still do every now and then is
sometimes what I've been like you know
you're looking at a selfie for too long
or it looks like all of your other ones
or it fits too much similarly to another
one is to reverse flip your photo so
like mirror image it if that makes any
sense
sometimes when
do that to a selfie I don't know why
well for whatever reason it just gets
like 10 times better all the sudden
you're like hey I look a lot different
it's the same photo it should flipped
but suddenly you just feel hotter I
don't know why it's a trick I swear to
God go grab a selfie and do it right now
because you were gonna be like whoa I
like this better
but yeah so those are all my tips if you
guys decide to use any of these tips be
sure to tag me in them so I can see them
I always love see you guys you're
posting and it's always so fun when you
guys like tag me and cool stuff and all
that I just think that's really cool you
know I just feel like I'm part of a club
and if you guys have any tips that you
think I may have missed then go ahead
and leave them down below so we can all
help each other be more Instagram and
all of that fun stuff so don't forget to
have fun with it don't put too much
value into it and other than that I love
