interesting adventure I'm gonna bring
you guys with me
and I'm back so I literally just made it
home like five seconds ago I didn't end
up blogging any of the apartment just
because I wasn't sure about how my
landlord would might like my new
landlord would feel about that but that
said I'm gonna vlog the whole process of
moving and such so that's going to be
