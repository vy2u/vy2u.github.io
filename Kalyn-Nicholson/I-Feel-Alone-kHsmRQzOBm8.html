I actually spend probably about 95% of
my week completely alone hey guys and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I am doing the ever ever request
coffee talk it has been probably one of
the highest requested things for me to
get back into making these sorts of
videos where I just kind of sit down and
do it coffee talk with you guys
I have no notebook here I have not
written out like a plan to like theme or
whatever I'm just going to rant about
whatever topic kind of like how I used
to you guys get the drill if you've been
watching me for a while you've probably
seen the coffee talk before I know we
talked about kind of heavier subjects or
more like advice or lifestyle or things
like that and yeah I'm just gonna flow
off of my own personal experience my own
opinion or perspective and I don't know
why I'm explaining this to you guys
let's just jump in shall we
so I actually asked you guys what kind
of coffee talks you wanted to see and a
huge theme that I noticed in terms of
the responses I was getting is to talk
about being alone or lonely per se and I
feel like this is actually a really good
topic for me to talk about right now
because it's very very relevant to my
own life I work from home I live alone I
eat alone I make dinner alone I go to
the gym alone I wake up alone and go to
sleep alone I do a lot of things alone
okay I have been lean but still you guys
know what I mean being somebody that's
used to being in a relationship and I've
been in and out of relationships with
very short periods of time of being
single in between from the time I was 15
up until like January of this year this
has been the longest period of time that
I've ever been single so while it has
been like a super i opening time of my
life to be honest with you guys there
I've definitely been periods where I
feel super lonely and isolated and alone
it has been evidently crucial to growing
and how much I have grown personally
this year so I'm just going to go off of
like that that is where I'm coming to
you guys from for this video so here's
the thing about being lonely something
huge that I'm
and recently about being alone is that
there is a massive massive difference
between being lonely and being alone
these two things are not the same it is
okay to be alone it is kind of sad to be
lonely does that make sense
I hope so so I feel like once you kind
of make that divide you realize that
just because you are alone doesn't mean
you're lonely I've noticed it in people
before and even myself that I feel like
sometimes we have this overwhelming fear
of being alone and so will constantly
surround ourselves by people just
because we don't want to be alone and a
lot of the times we end up surrounding
ourselves with bad friends staying in a
bad relationship keeping yourself around
toxic people or people that maybe you
don't really vibe with or they don't
really get you but you'd rather do that
then be off over here on your own and
that is just like it's something that
I've done it's something that I feel
like everybody's done probably at some
point in their lives and it is so it's
kind of sad some of the best things in
the world is sharing experiences with
other people but the thing is sometimes
honestly it's better to kind of be alone
than to be surrounded by the wrong
people
the reason why you're feeling lonely is
because you don't feel connected to
these people or maybe they don't
genuinely care about you or maybe you
are hanging out with the wrong people
for the wrong reasons I would rather
spend a lot of time alone in a long time
alone and wait for the right people to
walk into my life than to constantly
surround myself with people that drain
my energy and make me feel really crummy
about myself just because I'm afraid to
be alone you know solitude is crucial
for personal growth and for you to grow
and be the person you're supposed to be
maybe you have to go through a kind of
phase of solitude in order to get to
where you're going and in order to meet
better people for you and meet better
people for your life you have to learn
to be okay on our own we have to learn
to enjoy hanging out with ourselves and
it is so important to do you have to be
your own best friend sometimes actually
no you have to be your own best friend
all the friggin time you always have to
have your own back you have to have your
own best interest at heart it's not an
easy thing to do it takes time it takes
practice and huge thing is it takes the
mindset but honestly once you start to
learn to be okay on your own you're kind
of invincible of course you want people
around you and I'm not saying that you
should be like oh I don't need anyone
like screw everybody because that's
definitely not the case but you have to
learn to be independent you have to
learn to love yourself and then love the
time of being alone and love your own
company because if you can't love
yourself and you can't enjoy yourself
for who you are and on your own then how
can anybody else you know because if you
don't see your own value and you don't
see how fun and awesome you are even
just hanging out on your own then it's
going to be ridiculously hard for other
people to how much you enjoy spending
time alone is a huge reflection of your
own self-esteem I've probably gone
through and I'm not saying I'm alone all
of the time but I've definitely gone
through the last couple months pretty
alone like I I have a couple close like
really really close friends but I don't
have anybody that I talk to every single
day aside from like my family I don't
know I've had a lot of like big shifts
and change in terms of friendships and
relationships and such I've really had
to kind of take a step back and enjoy my
own solitude and it hasn't been an easy
thing to do it's it's hard I can't
explain to you guys how important it was
and it still is to my own personal like
development and growth because I have
never learned so much about myself or
grown so much within myself and I have
this year just 2016 you have to find
things that make you happy on your own
and and fight for yourself and be your
own best friend throw on a face mask
pour yourself a glass of wine or coffee
or tea throw on your favorite TV show
take yourself out to the movies take
yourself out for food go out and do
things on your own throw in your
headphones and just kind of vibe out in
terms of all of life see this time of
being alone or maybe isolated or not
really having a lot of people to
surround yourself with as an opportunity
to grow within yourself you also have to
have hope that there's people waiting
for you further down the road in terms
of life you just have to get there and
you're not going to get there wallowing
in your own self-pity or feeling upset
because you're alone can't wait around
for someone to save you or fix you or
make you feel happy
better you have to learn to do it on
your own and I am such a big believer of
this somebody walks out of your life
yeah it will shatter your heart to a
million pieces or if you lose a friend
it's going to make you feel absolutely
crummy about yourself but as long as you
know and you've built that foundation
within yourself you know you're going to
get through because you've gone through
periods of solitude you've gone through
periods of being alone so that no matter
who walks in and out of your life you're
invincible Yoram breakable it doesn't
mean that there's not going to be times
in your life where people can will
completely disappoint you but it just
means that you know you're gonna make it
through because you've been here before
you know how to enjoy your own company
and enjoy your own time you're going
through a period like that right now and
you're watching this and you feel lonely
see it as an opportunity to grow and to
learn to love yourself and hang out by
yourself and enjoy that time alone stems
from finding a passion it stems from
learning to enjoy yourself and relax and
enjoy your own company and also to keep
your mind busy and yourself busy as
yourself to get out and do classes or to
go to the gym or to make yourself
healthy meals to get really into a TV
show or a book or anything like that
just start doing things like that that
make you feel completely fine on your
own time will pass and suddenly you'll
be surrounded in a room full of people
that you absolutely love in a door and
you'll realize you made it through even
if you end up back there you'll
persevere because you've done it before
and you know how to be okay on your own
two feet you know how to be independent
you know that you always got yourself
because that is one of the most
important possible things to learn these
times of feeling lonely and by yourself
are when you're really going to discover
who you are and create who you are and
define who you are that's advice I can
give you guys is to not focus on what's
missing but focus on what's here what
you can control and what you do have
there's no reason why you should ever
feel like you need somebody to give you
a reason to wake up in the morning I
know what it's like to feel alone and I
know what it's like to feel lonely the
best thing it ever taught me and the
best thing I've ever learned stop
looking for what you need in other
people and start finding it within
yourself I don't even have a coffee for
this coffee talk and I hope this coffee
talk made sense so I feel like I was
kind of talking in circles and of course
