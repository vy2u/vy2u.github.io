out to go meet my friend Christine we
are heading it to this place called
crave in our hometown it has the best
coffee so friggin good it makes your
coffee taste like a Reese's Pieces
peanut butter cups so I mean I'm sure I
don't even have to further explain that
I'd say is also the day that I'm
starting my new kind of like fitness
like meal and health routine because
that's one of the changes I decided I
wanted to make with coming back from LA
Sunday that I was like I'm just going to
stay in my Airbnb for the night well one
of the things that I actually like
researched and planned and like came up
with this whole new fitness routine so
today is going to start the very first
day of it and if all goes well and you
guys want an updated fitness routines
and just thumbs up this video I'm gonna
have to do some meal prep today which is
actually a video that's going to go up
for Friday so that will already be live
by the time you guys see this I'll link
it on the screen or down below guys
Athena yet I'm going up with someone too
sorry for me finish this dream but I
much rather be somewhere else you laugh
loud a combo I hate driving around on
Saturday night make fun of me sing my
song get some stalls and take me a three
in and avoid you tonight because I'm
still feeling really really sick and
worked out I think it's from all the
sleep that I missed from taking like the
red-eye back from LA and everything I
also I picked up my parcels today so you
guys saw all of those clips as well I
got a parcel from Victoria's Secret I
picked up a bunch of new workout clothes
for the winter time I picked up some
stuff for some videos as well as things
that I'm going to decorate my apartment
with for Christmas time which I'm going
to do during this vlog so either
tomorrow or on Saturday I haven't
decided which day I want to do it yet so
with that said I'm gonna bring myself a
cup of tea and like cuddle into bed
you
I think I knew sink I knew I'm no good
for you
I'm paper sir
pay the cell where do I
yeah I could love you greater job and
stop to say stamp my mom's house these
room for improvement I just want to eat
my meal prep lunch it's just sweet
potato matched up with pasta sauce and
then the salad is a spinach salad
it's got like it's like grilled
artichokes definite cherry tomatoes
chickpeas balsamic vinegar and lemon
juice with a ton of pepper I'm going to
eat this and edit the meal prepping
video actually which I'm going to be
uploading right now I actually signed
onto my computer and opened up Final Cut
Pro I found the footage that I took last
week of when I got a new tattoo for
those of you guys that follow me on
snapchat you will have seen the snap
story that I posted of me getting a
tattoo and then I never showed it to you
guys and I've logged last week but
didn't end up posting any of the footage
so I'm going to do a cutaway clip here
where you guys can see me getting my
tattoo nervousness a little bit
she had a face yeah
what's up guys so I woke up this morning
with my friend Chris she slept over last
night I just drove her home and we
grabbed some peppermint me stoves in the
fall time I was drinking the skinny
cinnamon Dolce lattes with coconut milk
and I've switched over this is like my
favorite wintertime slash holiday drink
I get a medium like whatever they're
medium roast coffee is I get it as a
miso made with coconut milk and
sugar-free peppermint speaking of which
I feel like I may have already told you
guys this but I opened up a bunch of
parcels the other night two nights ago
things that came in the mail was all of
my stuff from society6 you guys know how
much I love society6 you know it's the
weekend it's Saturday and I don't have
any work to do today so I figured why
not decorate my apartment
Ronde jingle bells playing and a
yeah it's no one
 now begin to walk
jingle bell jingle bell
well jingle
my place is officially decorated for the
Christmas time which is super exciting
and also so I think I may or may not
have just booked my New York trip and
for those of you guys have been watching
me since the summertime I actually
booked a New York trip back in the
summertime and it got canceled and it
was due to like weather whatever reason
for whatever reason the airline just
completely canceled my trip I'm gonna be
able to fit it in before the end of 2016
meaning that it's not one of those like
things that kind of like rolls over into
the new year and I'm going to be able to
take seeing the Rockefeller treat off of
my bucket list
so yeah I'm like super excited I'm gonna
be going the week before Christmas I'm
so pumped I'm just waiting back to hear
from the Airbnb in hopes that I'll get
the one that I was kind of hoping for
I'm even gonna wait for the New Year to
start doing all the things I want to do
I just want to start doing them now so
that means you guys are going to have a
Christmasy New York vlog to look forward
to coming in December and other than
that I am going to go spend the rest of
my night probably dancing around my
apartment and cleaning because it's
quite the mess I hope you guys enjoyed
this my life Monday I will see you guys
