tour of our place because it is
absolutely insane something's like the
door that we came in from this is
Elena's room pardon what very you know

bags in the first room I saw and then I
was like Elena you can have it if you
want because I didn't realize I took

with like baskets of food vegan friendly
stuff so that's the kitchen look at this
little patio isn't this the sweetest

back to our hotel I cannot wait to call
this makeup off for the second time
today that's called the night Scotland

way too exhausted we ended up taking a
decent decent nap so I feel like we're

bottom that is how far we've hiked so
far and we're dying
