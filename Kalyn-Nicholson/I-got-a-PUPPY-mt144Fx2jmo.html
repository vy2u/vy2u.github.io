have some really really cool news for
you guys today um basically just to the
story I'm going to try and make it as
short as possible so I can spend more
time showing you guys more exciting
things but I decided to get a puppy and
I went ahead and got a toy Chihuahua if
you guys know what that is it's
basically just a very very miniature
small Chihuahua and I went ahead and got
one and I decided to get a dog because
just a number of reasons to help to help
with my anxiety I've wanted a dog for a
really really really long time and this
is like the perfect time for me it just
so happened to work out just with like
my schedule and just finance financially
just and worked out best for me to do
this now so I went ahead and got one and
his name was Colby so Colby was a little
toy Chihuahua but long story short
basically Colby was a little too young
to be away from his mother and the
breeder said I got him from they weren't
um unfortunately like I don't want to
bag on them or anything but they weren't
um very professional breeders and he was
way too early to be away from his mother
and she got very sick within the first
few hours that I had him because he was
too small and he was too it was too much
of a shock to him and he was too little
to be away from his mother and he wasn't
really eating or drinking much so um
long story short I had to bring Colby
back to the breeders and it was a really
really sad and really really um almost
like traumatizing experience because
there's a really long story that's
behind it but um I just don't want to
get too far into detail but basically
long story short I was really really sad
about it and so um my friend Ryan who
came with me to go pick up Colby he came
with me to bring Colby back and then we
were out for breakfast afterwards in the
town that I picked up Colby from and I
was like like we were just kind of
talking and I was like would it be bad
for me to get another puppy like I feel
like it would be kind of like like oh
that puppy didn't work out so I just
replaced him with this one but he made a
really good point that um it was going
to make me feel better about not being
able to keep Coby if I got another puppy
so we went ahead and
and I wasn't expecting to get one right
away but um I guess things kind of
everything happens for a reason and it
worked out that I ended up in contact
with this lady who had little chewy
knees and the chewy Nia is a Chihuahua
and wiener dog mix but he is the cutest
little thing ever there were so many
puppies um I'll insert a clip here of
all of like the amount of puppies that
we walked into the gate so basically
what it was is oops sorry
we decided I decided to go ahead and she
said I could go and get him that day so
I was like wow like this is a really
really quick but at the same time like I
was so happy so excited I'd been waiting
so long to get a puppy I had all this
stuff for him so I went ahead and was
like you know what like I'm just gonna
do it and so we drove out this one was a
little further it was about an hour from
town we drove out to go meet my little
puppy and Ryan and I we walked into the
gate and there was two litters of
puppies at this girl's house and we
walked into the gate she had like this
nice big garden of all the for all the
puppies to hang out in and it was like
101 Dalmatians like a billion puppies
just started running towards us it was
the cutest thing ever I wish I had
filmed it I wasn't really expecting that
but um they all just start running
towards us they were so cute so I did
take a video of some of the puppies
which I'll probably be inserting right
here as I speak but um so then other
than that I went ahead and I was looking
at the puppies and I told her I wanted a
smaller puppy because it's just more
convenient for me I've always wanted a
huge dog but just for this point in my
life right now I need a small puppy so I
told her I wanted one that was gonna
stay small and I told her that I wanted
a boy I've always wanted a boy dog so
she showed me the smallest boy that she
had and instantly I fell in love I fell
in love with like four other dogs when
we were there too but I ended up going
initially with the one that I thought
was my gut it was my gut feeling and he
was the first one but I wanted to give
all of them a home I wanted to bring
them all with me but I couldn't and so
um and there was another little guy too
there his name was buster and he she
didn't like his Nate she called him
Buster but she he was all over Ryan and
he just would not leave Ryan alone and
then this guy that I have he wasn't the
me alone you just kept cuddling me and
he is a tiny little thing but he was
feisty with like his brothers and
sisters so I'm
anyways long story short was yesterday
and I brought him home and he's just
been here with me for the for the night
now he's met a couple of my friends but
um and he is just the cutest little
thing and so I'm I was trying to think
of names for a while I almost named him
Reese or greases and I also almost named
him Coen but I'm a long story short I
ended up just getting him the name
Bentley so his name is Bentley but I
call him Benny boo and I also call him
Reese because his name is Ben Bentley
Reese Nicholson and but I really want to
call him Nicholson at the end because
that's a long name so Bentley Reese but
I call him Benny boo and I call him
Bentley and I call him Benz there's a
lot of different things I call him but
basically that is him and he's sleeping
right now as you can see my little
bundle of joy right there but my first
night with him was really really good
this is my very first puppy I have like
helps people with puppies before and
I've been around lots of dogs growing up
but I always wanted a dog and never got
one so he is just mine
I bought him with my own money I bought
everything for him with my own money and
last night he was great um we he made
him he's been a potty training him he's
pad trained right already so he goes
right to the pad when he needs to go and
he's very playful and he loves to give
his belly rubs and he loves to cuddle so
I'm gonna introduce you guys to Bentley
because you'll probably be seeing him in
a lot of my videos now and I
instagrammed a picture of him too so if
you guys want to see a lots of pictures
of him I would go ahead and follow my
instagram because I'm probably gonna be
instagramming a lot of pictures of him
and probably some vlogs of him too so
I'll put all that stuff in the downbar
but let's get to the fun part where you
guys get to meet him it's his Bentley

he loves to crawl into my clothes hamper
when I when I did my laundry I had a
bunch of clean clothes in my hamper and
he likes to climb in there
and sleep he loves to sleep in my hair
he's gonna grow to be about five pounds
and um basically he's uh he's gonna look
more like a chihuahua than a - hound but
he does have definitely some - mound
features to him he's got a little bit of
a longer body than a chihuahua but he
will look more like a chihuahua as he
gets older but just not so um he's gonna
he's gonna look like a mix of like a
Chihuahua and a hound so that's what
he'll look like when he's older and he's
