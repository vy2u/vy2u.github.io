the wedding is happy Friday
7:43 in the morning I've been up for
about 30 minutes just kind of lying here
if I'm gonna be 100% honest with you
guys all right it's time to get up and
do all the morning stuff that I like
oh I was gonna stop blogging today and
just delete all this footage and not use
it because I'm in a weird mood today I
guess you could say like I can just
sense that I'm not feeling myself but I
feel like maybe I could use this as kind
of like a theme for this vlog that maybe
it would be a good idea to kind of share
what my days do look like when I'm not
in such a great mood or how I kind of
deal with it the thing is is that
nothing's wrong like there's absolutely
nothing wrong at all there really is no
reason it's just one of those days you
know where you're just you're kind of
being thrown off a little bit I know a
big big part of it is definitely just
like in terms of what time of the month
it is for me regardless of if it's just
the fact that I'm actually in a sad mood
or if I'm actually just sad because I'm
a female I think it's kind of important
to let yourself have days like this
where you don't really feel that great
you know what I mean like it's not even
that I'm not happy like I'm very very
happy I'm just just kind of in a mood
where I want to be alone you know where
you don't really you just kind of not
bummed out like I don't even know how to
explain it but I don't know I feel like
life is a series of highs and lows it's
important to let yourself kind of
embrace or just feel low sometimes like
try not to fake it all the time if
you're feeling this way then just let
yourself kind of have a day where you
feel that way that way when you are
having like a good day or a happy day
you can embrace it more thoroughly
doesn't mean you're not happy or you're
not like grateful for your life I think
it just means that you haven't taken a
second to breathe in a while
like reconnect or ground your head a
little bit like I feel like I've just
been go go go and still brushed and just
my mind has been in a million places
over the last little bit I think
eventually it just starts to take it
kind of like a toll on my mood and if I
can give any sort of piece of advice of
what I like to do and I get into these
moods it's to just literally embrace it
and take the day for yourself like turn
off your phone they're like you're
comfiest clothes wear whatever you feel
so comfy and cozy I don't do some
mindless tasks like for me that's that's
cleaning I like to clean and like do
laundry and dishes and do all these
little things around my apartment put on
some like soft music like acoustic stuff
for indie stuff moon I'll leave
playlists that I like to listen to down
below or the one that I'm actually
listening to today throw something on
your TV and just get so wrapped up into
it or start a new book or finish a book
that you've been reading go out and buy
yourself like a new candle or fuzzy
blanket or a new face mask like a new
flavor of tea like don't treat yourself
to something that's going to make your
day kind of better like one thing that
you know it's like this was my source of
happiness today a new mug or a face mask
or a new nail polish color or something
like that that's just going to make you
feel good you know what I mean like a
little piece of feel good through the
day go for a walk or go for a drive and
completely just kind of disconnect from
the world and all of the things that you
feel you have to do and do something
that you want to do make yourself like
good old comfort food or order yourself
some takeout and throw a blanket on and
watch your favorite movie or watch a new
movie basically what I'm trying to get
at is that it's okay to not be a hundred
percent all the time I think when we
live in a world where the minute you
wake up you check your phone you're
checking your phone throughout the day
you're checking your phone before you go
to bed at night and everything that we
kind of tend to see is how awesome
everybody's doing and how great
everybody's life is because I mean in
all reality the Internet is kind of
a highlight reel of our lives right so
it's hard to kind of not feel this
pressure to kind of always be a hundred
percent all the time to always be
killing it you can't give away parts of
yourself to all of these different
aspects of your life whether that be
your family your school your work your
loved ones your friends anything if you
don't kind of take time for yourself to
recharge the rest of the world can wait
for you everything will still be there
tomorrow or the next day we all have
these days and I think sometimes just
knowing that someone else kind of can
feel like that sometime watching what
somebody else does or kind of fact
gaining that bit of inspiration to make
yourself feel better I think that that's
one of the coolest things about social
media be sure to let me know down below
what you guys like to do when you're in
one of these moves too and we'll kind of
create like a cool discussion in the
comment section of just everyone kind of
giving their two cents or their piece I
hope you guys enjoyed today's my life
Monday I hope I wasn't like a debbie
downer to you guys today and like
totally make you go from like being
super good mood happy to like feeling
low thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys all on Wednesday
hi guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
