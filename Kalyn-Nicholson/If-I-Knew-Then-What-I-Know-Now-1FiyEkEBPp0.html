be you'll be plastered unless you're
drinking coffee because then you'll be I
just did it hey guys and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm doing a
coffee talk with you guys
coffee in hand I'm getting so much
better at this where I don't actually
forget to make myself a glorious
succulent cup of coffee before I sit
down it's on the coffee talk also I'm in
the middle of doing like a no heat hair
challenge where I'm trying to go a whole
week without using any heat on my hair
and I can't really tell by the
viewfinder if this is if this look is
working for me so you're going to see me
flip and flopping it around so for
today's video I wanted to talk about
things that I wish I knew when I was a
teenager it's so funny because a lot of
this is probably relative to even if
you're not a teenager and you're
watching this or maybe you're like my
age and you're going to you're going to
hear me say anything you're like yep
wish I knew that too when I was a
teenager I really do wish I could go
back in time and sit my sixteen-year-old
buck down and be like listen let me just
tell you these things and save you so
much like heartache and so much stress
and anxiety I'm just tell you all the
secrets about life so you guys other
things that I wish I knew as a teenager
or things that I'll tell you if you're a
teenager that they're listening then
just keep watching number one for Christ
sakes
stand up for yourself the real Slim
Shady please stand up why why do you
stay so quiet like why do you let people
walk out over you like a doormat I do
not understand you can stand up for
yourself in a mature way and if there's
going to be times where you try and
stand up for yourself and you do it the
whole wrong way and you go at it with a
chip on your shoulder like everybody try
and mess with me attitude and don't do
that either just stand up for yourself
in the most mature collected way because
you're allowed to you're allowed to
stand up for yourself and number two
stand up for others don't be a bystander
you know like the amount of times that
you're gonna like involve yourself in
conversations that you don't even really
want to be in or like gossip or bullying
and just don't like stand out
rather people just as much as you would
want to be stood up for put yourself in
other people's shoes when people are
being talked about or bullied or
whatever even if it's just like a
passive thing like if it's just passive
aggressiveness where people are mean
without really even being mean stand up
for other people or be the kind person
that like reaches out and tries to make
someone feel better rather than making
people feel worse number three you do
not need to find your one true love in
high school okay can we just like relax
can we can we simmer
can we simmer the whole like falling in
love idea with all of these like Taylor
Swift songs and and these like this
glorious idea that you're going to meet
your one true love when you're young and
be together for the rest of your life
like no you think you know yourself so
you have no idea who the hell you are
you have no idea the person you're with
actually is because they don't know who
they are freaking props to anyone that
does find their one true love in high
school but take that pressure off
yourself
you don't even have to do that in your
twenty subtract just relax
number four is to learn to I'll let you
finish number four is to learn to laugh
at yourself like if I would have known
how to laugh at myself in high school I
think I would have gotten by a lot less
like anger and sadness I was so worried
about what people thought of me or so
worried about messing things up that
what I did I would just like the guilt
and the pressure would weigh on me so
much that I get angry with myself and
I'd get sad and upset instead of just
laughing at myself I took myself way too
seriously in high school and I took like
my feelings in my emotions way too
seriously in high school laughs like be
light-hearted don't take so
seriously it's like life it's easy to
send those up okay okay you're back the
Sun comes up Sun Goes Down it's us
humans that complicate it and when
you're a teenager you almost even
further complicate it so just put
yourself be light-hearted take life easy
you know number five
everybody's weird every single person
even the most popular or perfect person
you know is weird
so show your weird even if nobody else
is I wish like when I think about being
a kid I was such a weird kid
and somewhere along the way we lose that
weirdness we lose that ability to just
be goofy and be funny because like I
said we start taking ourselves too
seriously we train ourselves to hide
that because we think that people are
going to think that we're weird and
weird is so freaking cool you're going
to get your twenties and you're going to
have to retrain yourself to be okay with
your weirdness I'm 23 and I'm trying to
like be like letting my weirdness show
more because there's nothing wrong with
being weird if anything the weird
the weirder you are the cooler you are
in my opinion so it'd be weird even if
no one else is showing it because
everyone is weird why do we train
ourselves to stop being weird that is
like the worst worst idea we've ever had
number six is don't give up on your
passions even if nobody else believes in
you I couldn't even say it in the sense
of this was a passion of mine in high
school doing YouTube was something I
tried in high school okay and it was
comical and it was the exact same story
that pretty much every other youtuber
has where they got made fun of and they
deleted it in bubble blah but I was
obsessed in video editing I was obsessed
with the idea of like creating this
online world that could be like your
escape for your release so that was my I
was my wheelhouse and I got made fun of
and nobody believes in me I saw some
like my dad and like my sisters they
were the only two people that kind of
knew when I started doing YouTube again
nobody else really believes in me and
god bless them for doing it because they
were the ones that when I would start to
take myself too seriously and not learn
to last myself and I feel like I don't
know if I can do this they'd be like no
it's cool keep going no matter what
you're passionate about no matter what
you love to do even if nobody else
believes in you keep doing it anyway
like Scruton aiders you know audios
mother tip number seven is take a ton of
pictures don't delete them you know it
all ties back again to taking ourselves
way too goddamn seriously there came a
point in like grade twelve my last year
of high school where I look back on all
my my high school days and my even my
elementary school days and I was like
holy sweet Jesus delete any evidence of
me ever looking that way so here I have
now a 23 god I would just love to pull
up one of those photos but I can't
because I deleted them all you know so
yeah take more photos don't delete them
proud of them number eight is one of the
ones that I like the most important one
that I wish I could go back and tell
myself
and it's what you think of yourself is
more important than what anybody else
thinks of you I can go back and tell
myself to care more about what I feel or
think about what I'm doing than what
anyone else feels or thinks about what
I'm doing I think I would have saved
myself a lot of doing things under peer
pressure doing things without even the
peer pressure but doing things just for
the sake of thinking people would like
me more and saying things because I
thought that's what people would want to
hear what that's what I thought people
wanted from me I think I could save
myself a lot of that I can pinpoint
multiple times in my teenage career
where I really didn't like myself and it
was because I lost myself trying to
appease to everybody else and nobody was
even putting that pressure on me I was I
feel like that's probably one of the
most important things I go back and tell
myself it's that the way you feel about
yourself is more important than how
anyone else feels about you you have to
like you more than you need anyone else
to like you because you're the one
that's got to wake up and go to sleep
and be with yourself every day so yeah
number nine oh boy you will recover from
your first heartbreak and your second
heartbreak and your third heartbreak
even though it feels like the end of the
world because I like it's almost kind of
funny when I look back on how upset I
would get over boys in high school I
remember I vividly remember my first
like real heartbreak it felt like I
couldn't even breathe air into my lungs
it hurts so bad and I would like
hibernate my blankets and listen to the
most email music why and be so sad and
heartbroken disturbingly embarrassing
you know Facebook statuses or bbm
statuses like shout out if you even
remember what bbm is I'm talking like
ugly cry two hours straight heartbreak
and we are a teenager it just it feels
like you're never going to find someone
like that again you're never going to be
in love with someone like that again but
holy crap that is like the furthest
thing from the truth so yeah I would
love to go back and just pet the hair of
the little fifteen year old me crying
her eyes out and be like oh dear Lord
you have no idea who but it's okay
because we all do it the kind of thing
that I would go back and tell my teenage
self is it's okay to feel can
fused and alone like if there was an
album of my teenage youth it probably
would be titled confused and alone I was
so so lost like I almost like cling to
the idea of my loneliness and I mean
I've talked to you guys about this
before like I definitely suffered from
anxiety and depression long before my
20s like in Miami my high school career
I definitely struggled with being
anxious and I struggled with social
anxiety and I struggled with depression
but I in a way I almost kind of clung to
it and I almost kind of beat myself up
for it I'd be like why do I feel this
way why am I so confused why am I so
lonely and I really wish I could go back
and just be like listen it's okay to
feel that way because everyone on some
cosmic level feels that way everyone at
some point in their life feels that way
and you're not the only personal member
of even feeling that at that second
there's someone else wondering the exact
same thing you're always going to be
confused like I'm 23 and I'm still
confused then it kind of takes the
pressure off you know just just be
confused like there's almost kind of
beauty in that so just take that
pressure off and let yourself feel the
way you feel without beating yourself up
words six and a half hours later so my
camera totally died to wrap it all
together with a pretty bow those are the
10 things that if I could go back in
time and tell myself as a teenager or
things I wish I knew as a teenager those
would be it so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video make sure to leave a comment
down below telling me if you go back in
time and tell a past version of yourself
something what would it be because I
mean there's so much that I probably
left out of this video that I would go
back and tell myself but those were like
the highlights and I'm curious like what
age would you go back to and what would
you tell yourself and other than that I
hope you guys enjoyed this coffee talk I
love you guys to the moon and back and I
will see you guys all in my next video
bye guys
