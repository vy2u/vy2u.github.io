Halloween
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video it's the
final day of you tober which is like
devastating where did it go
so for my last and final you tober video
considering this was going up on
Halloween I figured I would put up a
vlog for you guys since it's kind of
like Halloween right now even though
it's only the weekend with how I'm
falling on a Tuesday this year all of
the Halloween festivities are happening
this weekend so I'm going to be vlogging
with you guys
it is currently Saturday last night Greg
and I went to a Halloween party we were
vampires I was gonna try and vlog it but
we were running so late that I got no
footage and right now it's like middle
of the day but it's so like gloomy and
rainy right now in Toronto like like the
weather is just know so I am chilling in
my PJs no joke I just grab some lunch
from fresh and switched in to comfy
clothes and now I'm just gonna hang out
Bentley is already in his first costume
of the vlog we have a little mini Batman
have this heated blanket going cuz it's
like super chilly in here and he won't
move so I just picked up a wrap crack it
open and watched some friends now that
I'm done editing and then I decided
after that I will shower and actually
make myself exist I'm hanging out with
Greg in a bit he's currently at work so
I've got some time to kill but I
honestly I can't even be bothered to put
on pants and be in anyone's presence
right now so having a few hours to chill
is working out quite nicely so I'm about
to go elbow deep in this wrap and I'll
keep you guys posted on what we end up
doing today I just remembered there's a
new stranger things yes now we can
resume
so now actually the next day I didn't
end up flocking too much last night Greg
and I just kind of hung out what did we
oh we finished stranger things oh my god
if you guys watch stranger things let me
know I'm not gonna make any spoilers but
we literally finished the second season
in like a day and a half it was so good
I'm deeply deeply upset that I know that
they haven't even started filming the
third season yet I might just rewatch
the whole thing like season one and
season two because I just want to stay
in the world that is stranger things
also I just picked up some parcels I
know that it's still Halloween but I'm
pretty sure my Christmas tree just
arrived which is kind of funny these
just came today they're massive so I'm
not too sure what they are but let's
open them shall we it's so cute
it makes such a mess oh my god it's
definitely way too early to put this out
but I'm a little too lazy to put this in
my storage lockers so I feel like I
might just I might just this outfits
also supposed to be a devil costume but
besides this Christmas tree I'm looking
like I'm a little ahead of the times
it's all good though they'll put you in
your new home since I put it up early
I'll at least wait to light it until
November really wanted a Christmas tree
for not only my like living room because
I obviously have my big Christmas tree
but I wanted a small Christmas tree for
my bedroom like I'm going so festive
this Christmas it's gonna be ridiculous
I'm gonna put the holiday cheermeister
to shame I'm gonna throw up Santa that's
a little aggressive but you guys know
what I'm saying so I'll wait to light
that Christmas tree until you know
November but in the meantime I have no
idea what this parcel is
reveal yourself
oh it's only a year late but that's okay
now what do I do with it where do I put
this golden button decided to a boy
that's so exciting oh my god - pretty
cool parcels if I do say so myself so
it's now actually getting pretty late
into the night I'm about to head to the
grocery store I also need to go to the
pet store and pick up a new costume for
Bentley for actual Halloween because
we're gonna be handing out candy and I
want Bentley to be in a little costume
for us I'm heading out to do that and
then I'm also gonna hit the grocery
store and grab some stuff to make for
dinner I have been craving spaghetti and
vegan meatballs for like three days now
and so I'm gonna make that with some
garlic bread and I might even pick up a
bottle of wine even though this is the
last eat over video and technically it's
not done yet
you Tomer kind of officially ended today
it came in to eat over together so we'll
all go up together so I'm gonna grab the
stuff to make vegan spaghetti and
meatballs I might watch Riverdale and
and have a glass of wine
I'm making Bentley a beer and I'm gonna
be a hillbilly tomorrow I mean really
though this was the only costume that
they had that would fit him but I
actually kind of find it hilarious quite
an improvement from last time
guys this meal is insane it's like
hankering the entire craving I had for
spaghetti and meatballs
that's the garlic bread is so I'm
actually a pig so between this putting
on friends and cuddling up in a blanket
this is pretty much the best night ever
top of the morning to you guys and happy
Halloween it's finally Halloween I feel
like I've been teamed fallen Halloween
since pretty much August so it's kind of
weird that Halloween is finally here
aside from uploading today's video
everything that I pretty much have to do
between now and Thursday when we leave
for Mexico is literally just catching up
on all the life stuff that I fell behind
on over the month I went got a pedicure
which you guys already saw in this vlog
today I'm going to get my nails done I
think I'm gonna go with white for
vacation and tomorrow I'm going to get
my hair dye note which I'm super excited
about because I think I might change it
up today I'm gonna be cleaning my
apartment before we go hand out candy
it's just like I feel so like a weight
has been lifted off my shoulders and
like I can finally start to change
things up my routine has been the same
for so long to get all these videos done
that I'm honestly just excited to like
chill out for a bit I'm not entirely
sure if it's from stress or if it's from
like a makeup product that I've been
wearing but my eyes and my skin have had
some sort of reaction to something and
all of the skin around my eyes has
gotten like red and scaly and flaky I
just tried to put makeup on and I had to
stop because not only are my eyes like
burning my skin is starting to feel like
so scaly and dry it also just be the
time of year to since it is starting to
get super cold out I'm even just excited
for the next two weeks to just like not
wear makeup and let my skin kind of
figure itself out because even like my
health I've completely fallen off my
workout routine I fridge is broken so I
haven't been able to like cook as much
as usual or meal prep oh I just love I
love that feeling when you know you're
just about to like start making better
habits again it's so lame but it's so
true so I have about an hour before I
need to go to my nail appointment so I
think I'm gonna spend that time just
kind of cleaning up my apartment because
that's also turned into a mess over the
last month I'm not sure how late in the
day I'm going to vlog since I am going
to be uploading this at 5 p.m. so
therefore you guys probably won't be
able to come trick-or-treating even
though I'm excited for November and I'm
excited to get back to a bit more
balanced
also really sad that Yuto burrs over it
and that daily videos are done so we're
gonna hang out as long as we can today
by my way
- where are Moscow
la bestia never
in about the place on never
feeling the quagmire somehow get the
feeling I don't
I'll become
and on
and you
I'll be tired
driving auntie
3,000 miles in Sparta man
- hi
oh this is the cutest thing I have ever
seen
so because I'm not trying to wear any
makeup with my skin reacting to whatever
it reacted to I decided that I'm a frat
boy with my socks and sandals and my
backwards cap and Bentley is my beer
which he looks extremely happy about
it's like mom what is this hat oh you
are too cute that is what we are for
having me this is too much he's so cute
you want to treat come on first things
first I ended up doing white on my nails
I don't know if I already told you guys
that's what I was doing but this is how
my nails turned out and I got them
squared it is officially at the end of
you Tober can I first start by saying
thank you guys so much not only just
like hanging out with me for the whole
month but also your words of
encouragement this month were so I can't
explain to you guys there were a couple
there was a handful actually of nights
in this month where things just went
totally wrong or I thought I was gonna
fall behind
no one's self-doubt just kind of sucks -
hello consult out starts - just like
trickle in and the times of those
happened it just took reading my tweets
or going on and seeing your guys's
comments on the videos should just like
push me past it and I'm really happy
with how you two over turned out this
year I worked so much harder on you
Tober this year that I have any of the
other years so it just it meant a lot to
read all of your guys's comments and to
honestly feel more connected with you
guys I feel like you guys got to know
even more about me this time and I
noticed that more of you guys than usual
we're just like commenting and writing
in and it just meant the world to me
it's gonna be so weird waking up
tomorrow and not having to upload a
video at the same time I feel like so
much has changed in my life from this
youtuber to last eat over it isn't until
I'm put under an immense amount of
stress that I feel like some of the
parts of myself that I like to keep
hidden in some of the parts of myself
that we all have that we all don't
necessarily like start to come through
and as much as I absolutely love this
month I definitely feel like I need to
change things up shake things up and
kind of take some time to get my
she just kind of get my groundings again
if you guys watched my San Francisco
vlog at the beginning of this month and
just other videos throughout I've talked
a lot to you guys about how my anxiety
has gotten so bad this month and I mean
it was so bad that even just getting my
nails done today I could feel the panic
setting in and it's weird because even
though I'm still able to film and edit
and put forth all this content in the
background I've been dealing with a lot
of my anxiety and my social anxiety
again and I just want to be able to take
a step back and kind of work on that and
get that figure it out I always try and
be as authentic and as real with you
guys as possible and so that's why I'm
even telling you guys this and that's
why I hope hope hope you guys will
understand that I don't know how long
but I just need to take a bit of a detox
from filming things and trying to curate
and ideas for videos and all of these
things and I think I just need to take a
step back and reconnect with like the
present moment and just be like just be
any time I go through phases like this I
always feel like at the end of it I'd
come back stronger and with more clarity
and more like knowledge not only life
but myself and so I just need to go and
just do that and and just kind of take a
break from my phone take a break from
technology take a break from the
constant feed of like Instagram and
Twitter and YouTube and all this content
that's constantly in front of our faces
which is an amazing thing like obviously
I love to do it but I just I think all
of us every now and then should take a
break from it I'm gonna be getting back
on to the coast socials and just working
on COEs in the background a bit while I
take this detox just so I'm still
working on something something tells me
it won't be a super long break but that
said I'm not gonna put a time limit on
it it's just gonna be once I feel better
and should just know what it's like to
have a morning coffee and go to yoga
without like you know posting about it
or to be constantly aware what everybody
else is doing with their legs I just
want to not be constantly consuming all
this information and just kind of exists
for a little bit I just know that if I
don't feel in touch with my purpose and
if I don't get a handle on why I'm
feeling so anxious and what's going on
I'm honestly just slapping a bandaid on
every time I film and every time I do
something and I don't want to do that
because that I feel like I'm being
unattended
that is my ramble that is the detox that
I plan on taking for the next a little
bit I have some changes that I want to
do over the next few weeks and just some
like
I feel just just know that I'm not gonna
be gone long but I need to recharge and
when I come back I promise you not only
are things gonna be festive but things
are gonna be different and that's all
I'm gonna sit me so other than that
thank you guys so much for hanging out
with me for the last 31 days I love you
guys to the absolute moon in back
there's literally no other way I would
spend my October than hanging out with
you guys daily and so I appreciate all
of you guys so much I love you guys so
much and I'm so sad it's over but I'll
see you guys sooner than later and adios
you tober until next year bad guys
it's a fiery
and I rather be savile you and anywhere
away from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
