to be sharing with you guys some DIYs
that I have been working on that help
with inspiration goal-setting and all
that fun stuff that's kind of been like
the theme of this month so with that I
thought it would be a really good idea
to do some DIYs that work towards those
goals and sticking to like all of the
things that we're trying to change as
well as it all just being really damn
cute decor that you could put up in your
room so without further ado let's jump
in to the DIY inspirational um things I
don't know what I'm gonna call this
so to start I picked up this roll on
chalkboard paper that you can stick to
pretty much anything I got this from
Walmart for three dollars so it was
super affordable and then I'm just using
a ruler to kind of map out an even
calendar now you could really do
anything with this you can stick this
anywhere it could just be a place that
you write things that you need to
remember for the week or what however
you want to do it but I thought I could
use a calendar over my desk so that is
what I decided to do leaving a section
on each side for weekly notes and like
happy thoughts and things like that and
I just thought that this was a really
cool way and a really affordable way of
having like a wall calendar that isn't
as tacky as like some of the dry erase
ones that you see so this is like a cute
decor way of having a calendar up on
your wall behind your desk or maybe in
your kitchen or wherever you would like
to put it so that costed me of total of
maybe five dollars and now I'm also
somebody that needs to write down
everything whether it be journals notes
or ideas or just fun things that I want
to do so I picked up a few journals from
staples or agendas or not agendas
notebooks that's the word I'm looking
for and then I just printed out some
cute designs that I like and I'm just
coming up with random ways of decorating
the outsides with just cute paper and
using it you could use scissors but I'm
using one of those oh my gosh I can't
think of the name right now do you guys
can think of the name of that thing just
let it leave it down below and yeah so
you guys can probably see the design
that I'm doing here and recreate it if
you want or come up with a fun design or
pictures of your own and so this is
going to be my new journal and I have
another one for notes and video ideas
and a bunch of other things
and also just a quick tip if you guys
are going to be designing any type of
notebooks or journals I would recommend
using that cement glue that I'm using
there you can find it at any at any sort
of craft store for pretty affordable and
it's good for mounting things to
journals and things like that and then
afterwards you can rub off the excess
and it goes back to the normal notebook
material so that is just a really fun
and easy tip and then I just grabbed
some chalkboard labels and I'm using the
chalkboard pen to write exactly what
each agenda or not agenda Gee's notebook
is going to be used for I hope you wanna
know just where we're going to and the
next I figured four days where you know
things aren't going so well or you're
having that that grade of a day but you
still want to stick to like your good
mood or your goals or whatever it is I
decided to make this little fortune
teller thing so grab any kind of glass
jar you could use a mason jar you could
use whatever you want and then I just
took some chalkboard paint and poured it
on top so that it would drip down and
then I'm just taking a little bit of
card stock and cutting out little
rectangles so that I can write fortunes
on them and you could do this with
anything you could even just use a
normal mason jar if you don't feel like
decorating it and just cut out a bunch
of fortunes or save a bunch of fortunes
from fortune cookies or print out a
bunch of fortunes again there are so
many ways you could do all of these DIYs
but this is just a really fun and easy
way of just like you're having a bad day
or you're feeling lucky and you just
want to get a fortune told for what's
going on in your life you can just use
this or kind of pick one out and maybe
it'll like brighten up your day or you
can leave it on your desk and they're
just like fun and positive things that
you might need to read or hear during
the day
and then this DIY is one of the easiest
so just take a few pieces of paper and
decide how many years down the road you
want each of them to be and then all you
have to do is on each piece of paper on
point in point form or you could write
paragraphs right down exactly where you
want to be by that time so I did one for
one year three years five years ten
years and then 20 years and then I'm
just going to put them in different
envelopes or you could paint a bunch of
white envelopes really cool designs
again you can do this in so many
different creative ways and then I'm
just putting the date on the bottom of
when each of them will be opened and
then having that in a frame you could
put that on your wall you could put it
on your desk you could just put it
anywhere beside your bed and looking at
those no one else is going to know what
you've written inside but you're going
to know that that is where you want to
be and however many years so looking at
it might be a good indicator that will
kind of get you out of bed and pushing
towards where you want to be in that one
year or three years or doing something
that's going to get you that much closer
Oh
and then last but not least I'm going to
show you guys a few different ways that
you can make an inspiration board so all
you have to do is print out any sort of
pictures of anything that you aspire for
in however many years I decided to print
off things that included fears that I
wanted to face and different things I
wanted to do in different places I
wanted to go and live and be and all of
that fun stuff so you can do this
looking on tumblr We Heart It or you
could print off your own pictures or
look in magazines there's so many
different ways you could find pictures
and then for the first one I decided to
do all black and white because it would
match the theme of my room so you could
do this in a way that doesn't look like
you know you're just like doing a bunch
of like crafts and just throwing it up
on your wall if you print it out in a
color that matches you the color scheme
or put it in a frame or there's a bunch
of different ways you could do that to
kind of display what you're inspiring
for or aspiring for and display it on
your wall or on the back of your door or
in your closet or and any place that you
might see it and a different way you
could do this is grabbing some cork
board and this time I decided to put the
pictures in color and then get a bunch
of really colorful tax and then tack
them up into the cork board itself and
this just kind of looks like a fun
display but in all reality it's an
inspiration board of the things that you
want to get to where the things you want
to do and you like
a third way you could do this if you're
not somebody that wants to display it on
your wall is you could pick up a binder
or an agenda or a journal or whatever it
is something that is like a book that
you might look at every day and then
post the pictures on there so that if
it's at school or if you're just writing
at night you'll see those things that
you're trying to achieve in life so that
was all of the different ways that you
could do an inspiration board along with
all of the other inspirational DIYs that
I had to show you guys today I hope you
guys enjoyed this video
be sure to send me any pictures you guys
decide to try any of these and I will
see you guys all in a future video bye
