video I'm going to be finally answering
the Q&amp;amp;A from Instagram that I did like
let's take up put it up about a month
ago
hey you don't even care you just want to
play if I'm drinking my coffee halfway
through I have this obsession with these
coffees I've been making at home and I
just can't stop drinking them all so
we're not done decorating the apartment
yet which is why I haven't done the
apartment tour I think I'm gonna wait
until we get one more thing which is
something I'm actually going to get
tomorrow so expect an apartment or
berries
so both Sydney Atchison and sim Maria 17
both asked very similar questions along
the lines of when did you start making
YouTube videos and how old were you and
the other girl asks when did you start
YouTube and why so I'll answer those
ones kind of together I believe I was 15
the first time I tried to film a YouTube
video I'm gonna sneeze right now yes I
was 15 I believe when I first started to
try to do YouTube now I say try because
I actually had a different YouTube
channel I was always really enticed by
YouTube and always wanted to do
something that was creative and within
media and editing and videos and such
because I do quite enjoy that also as
well as beauty fashion hair all of that
type of stuff and the two just kind of
came together in one and it just seemed
like something I just really wanted to
do I was kind of lost at the time and
was trying to figure out who I was and I
felt really alone so I just started
making YouTube videos the only thing is
that that channel didn't follow through
because I think I got to about like a
thousand subscribers and then people
from my high school at the time found
out and a bunch of people made fun of me
for it a bunch of people were like
watching them in groups and laughing at
me I let them get the best of me and I
deleted the YouTube and tried to act
like it never happened
nice to accompany so yes I let them get
the best of me and I deleted the YouTube
and left it at that and I didn't start
doing it again until I was away from
hold my hometown for school I was away
at college and I had made another
YouTube in my last year of high school
but I never really uploaded on it and
then I decided you know what I'm just
gonna get right back into it and it was
around the time again that I felt really
lost wasn't sure what I was doing this
my life I moved back home I started
doing YouTube videos and now here I am
so the time that I started up let's say
this channel I was eighteen seventeen
turning eighteen and yeah like a list
I'm sorry if I worried you guys names
wrong asks if you could live anywhere
where would you live I love you kisses
from Italy if I could live anywhere
right now it would be LA or New York so
Caitlyn asks if you could choose one
what would it be life with no makeup or
life without your dog please choose so I
would a hundred percent choose life
without makeup that sounds silly I mean
some people might not be that close with
their dogs
some people might completely understand
where I'm coming from with this but
Bentley is literally my life anybody
that knows me knows that he's my life he
is a baby
he is babied and he's a spoiled little
pup but it's just because I can't
explain to you guys how much he fills my
heart so Hanna nua 10:22 asks what is
your favorite of school if I were to
look back on school and pick my favorite
grades I'm gonna do one for high school
and one for elementary because those are
two just completely separate things I
want to say grade 3 or grade 4 that was
when I was like really really closest
with my friend Monique at the time so
yeah I'm gonna say grade 3 cuz we had a
split grade 3 to class and her and I
were just that was probably one of the
funnest years about him and she school I
can think back on just like even
watching movies and doing back drawers
and Disney movies and crafts and stuff
and it was just so much fun and we both
had a crush on the same boy and that was
just the funnest year of elementary
school for me and I would say the
funnest year of high school for me was
probably grade 11 in grade 11 it was the
year that my cheerleading team won
national champion
and I was doing really well in school
and I just I had the most fun I'd say in
grade 11
so macaroni 97 asks will you ever do a
boyfriend tag we are planning on doing a
boyfriend tag extremely soon we just
haven't gotten around to picking a time
where we can do it we both have kind of
conflicting schedules and any time Ryan
can do something usually he's helping me
out with filming or he's helping me take
blog posts so it's really hard for us to
pick out a time to do the boyfriend tag
plus he is still very worried about it
so I'm talking him into it don't worry
he's convinced that he's gonna do it we
just haven't chosen a time yet so just
stay patient you guys will meet him very
soon so Liz Expo xx out asks to people
consider you shy or outgoing and I feel
like I want to say a mixture of both I
can be extremely shy but I can also be
extremely hyper and outgoing and really
weird Nick email asks do you think
you'll ever get a peel box so we can
send our favorite youtubers stuff I'm
looking into getting a peel box very
soon I might be moving away from where
I'm living right now next year so that's
my only fear with getting a peel box is
that I won't be able to check it
regularly so once I have a better
understanding of where I'm gonna be
headed next year I'm going to get on APO
box right away t kitten asks any new
tattoos soon I'm not playing on getting
any more tattoos soon I kind of want to
leave space for when I'm older if I
decide to get one I'm like in my later
20s I was just want to say in my 20s and
then I forgot that I'm 20 that's so
depressing I can be quite impulsive
though like I was with all of my
previous tattoos so you never know
Jamie h30 asks if you could write a book
what would the title be and your
favorite snack of all time so this is
kind of a fun fact in high school I
actually wrote a short novel I have
always been really into writing I write
journals I've always written like short
stories and such and creative writing
has always just been something that I've
really enjoyed so I did a creative
writing class in school and I actually
wrote a shortened norm short novel and
it was called the dream catcher if I can
find a copy I will put it on my blog or
something and really
to you guys so you guys can read it and
my favorite snack of all time is green
apples dipped in natural crunchy peanut
butter and I'm really crazy but it has
to be the natural crunchy peanut butter
because I find normal peanut butter at
room temperature on a cold Apple I don't
like the mixture of those textures it's
really weird
haha it's Rachael asks why did you cut
your hair because my hair was dead it
was fried and it needed a cut and
regrowing it out so I just needed a
fresh start
thank you thank you work it I nice meet
you I can't play right now bub so Cassie
kisses asks can you talk more about how
you control your anxiety better and no
one have you launched to with working
out but that's about it I would love to
learn more tips review if you guys want
a full video on anxiety and such just
let me know and I can do that because I
feel like it's just a really long topic
and this video would just go on forever
but if you want some short tips I find
just separate yourself when you're
feeling anxious and just breathe and
calm yourself down Bentley I really
can't play right now honey um and just
try and eat better and work out and find
a way to release your stress and it that
will bring your anxiety down so nas nas
Sarah Matt asks what's the hardest thing
about being a youtuber I find for me the
hardest thing about being a youtuber is
sometimes you wake up and you just you
have no idea what you want to film you
aren't feeling anything and if you film
so you're trying to film something and
it's just not coming across right you're
not really feeling it but you have
expectations on the other side of it
people writing to you tweeting to
instagramming like where's the new video
where's a new video and I think that's
the hard part is trying to find that
balance because obviously you guys want
to see new content but I don't want to
film content that I'm not proud of and
sometimes it you get this creative block
and it's just not working and the second
hardest thing would be that it's a
mixture of starting with the fact that I
started at 18 and I'm now I started at
early early 19 and now I'm 20 I'm still
at an age where I'm still learning more
about myself and I'm creating more of
myself and learning more about myself
and I'm trying to expand Who I am as a
person while also having people
which means so that part is kind of hard
in the sense that if I decide to cut my
hair or change the color or do something
crazy or get a tattoo a lot of people
have judgments and comments about them
and so it's hard to kind of discover who
you are when there's other people that
don't want you to change but I'm a
strong believer that change is a good
thing so as long as I am happy with who
I am at the end of the day I hope that
the people that really enjoy my content
are as well and can see past the little
things that might not be their thing to
understand that I'm still my own person
as an individual so yeah that is two
little tiny things in all the amazing
things and the grateful things I am for
being able to do YouTube so Fernanda ACX
asks when you're feeling down or sad
what's one thing that keeps you positive
um there's a lot of things that I find
when I'm down and sad that helped me
remain positive
Bentley is definitely one of them like I
could just be in the worst mood ever and
he rolls over like this or a belly rub
and I'm just instantly happier again my
family and my friends and the people
that have my best interest in their
heart those are the people that make me
feel happy and better after a long or a
sad time in my life people that I can
just message and not even have to tell
them that something's wrong and they
just make me feel better without even
knowing it those are the people that
make it a lot better for me and of
course Bentley and of course Ryan as
well so that is the stuff that makes me
feel better after a long or sad or tough
day so I answered a bunch of the
questions if I didn't get to your
question I deeply deeply apologize I
will be doing another Q&amp;amp;A soon so just
react it or ask another one and maybe
I'll get to yours next time I wish I
could answer every single one of them
but this video would just be hours long
other than that I hope you guys enjoyed
this Q&amp;amp;A and getting to know me a little
bit better I'm sorry Bentley was being
so rude trying to play with me this
entire video thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you out in a
future video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
