to be doing the Q&amp;amp;A that I recently put
up on Instagram I believe it was so I am
going to open up the questions and jump
right in because I believe there was
quite a few of you guys so seeing as
there was so many questions I will do
more Q&amp;amp;A s more frequently since it
seems to be something that you guys
really wanted to see so I will be doing
more Q&amp;amp;A so if I didn't get to your
question hopefully I can get to it in
another video so hold tight but that
said let's jump into the questions leave
the name to the person who asked the
questions just in this general area
since I will more than likely butcher
the name so I apologize if I say your
guys's names wrong
Rachel Darnay asks would you get another
dog and I am somebody that I would get a
million dogs if I could I probably
wouldn't get another dog anytime soon
because a Bentley is actually my baby
and I really don't think he would like
that and B Ryan and I have talked about
getting more dogs but I think we want to
do it more so in the future so that we
can you know travel and move around a
little bit more before throwing more
dogs into the mix luckily Bentley has
quite a few fans amongst the family so
any time when we go anywhere any time I
go anywhere there's always multiple
people that get to watch him like my dad
for instance and we lived at my dad's
Bentley now for a while so he has his
little home away from home so it's
really easy with Bentley but I don't
think I throw any more drops into the
mix just out of it being unfair to them
but oh you best believe I will be
getting more dogs in the future one day
so Aiza or
EXO underscore underscore asked how long
have you been dating your boyfriend so
Ryan and I I would say we've been
together for over two years now but we
haven't been like officially day day
when August it'll be two years of
officially dating but we've been
together for a long we were together
before we started to like officially
date so we've been together for longer
than we've been dating but so around two
years give or take Gabrielle Leanne 28
asks would you ever do a meet-up and yes
I
so many meetups and I just never know
really like when I'm traveling it's
always so last-second and I never know
if I should just like last-second tweet
oh oh I'm in this area who's here who
wants to do a meet-up or if I should
plan it more thoroughly or I don't
really know I'm hoping to do one in
Toronto at least this summer so either
July or August but either way I want to
do more meetups as many places as
possible so let me know where you guys
are from down below and if I'm in those
general areas then I will plan some
Meetup
so Kate baby underscored to you asks
tips I'm going vegan and budget-friendly
ideas so my tips for going vegan would
be to make sure that you're eating
enough because with a vegan diet you
have to eat more than you usually do
especially if you're going kind of like
high carb vegan you'll need to eat a lot
of potatoes a lot of rice and always
keep yourself full I'll keep the
cravings and and stuff up Bay and to a
minimum if you're constantly keeping
yourself full with really good foods and
just stay motivated and inspired by just
like researching what other vegans are
doing or no other vegans are cooking I
find doing that just kind of makes me
more excited about making my own vegan
meals so that I'm not so tempted to be
like oh I wish I could be Pizza tonight
it's more so like oh my gosh I'm so
excited to make vegan pizzas with all
these cool random recipes and vegetables
it's just it's more fun that way and
budget wise I would say to meal prep and
plan your meals in advance in the sense
of when you go to the grocery store
don't just buy a wok load of like
produce and stuff and then you don't
really have a plan on how you're gonna
cook it all kind of a plan in mind and
do meal prep so go to the grocery store
get the stuff that you need and make
your meals for about 3 days in advance
like dinners and lunches and then
obviously you would just make your
breakfast is as it is breakfast and
doing that can kind of help save some
money because you're not throwing out so
much produce and stuff that it goes bad
so those of you my tips you guys not
like a full vegan video let me know down
below and I can do that baby Caitlyn
XOXO asks how is your life so perfect do
you ever stress
answering this question to let you know
that my life is not perfect it's not
even remotely perfect I want you guys to
always keep in mind that everything you
see of my youtube videos Instagram photo
is just like everything it's always
planned or edited and it's never my life
isn't actually like that everybody's
Instagram and social media it's always
like the highlight reel of their life or
like the best version of themselves or
the best version of their lives and
that's okay there's nothing wrong with
that but just know that I am not perfect
and my life is not perfect and I am just
a normal human being and I stress like
way more than I should
into the sense that it's like an
unhealthy amount of stress not so much
lately but my life is not perfect you
guys see the highlights of my life and
that's something that I think I'm going
to start changing a little bit more it's
just being more not so planned and more
just kind of like alive and real with
you guys and I think that's what I want
to start doing more so now so no my life
is not perfect and yes I stressed quite
a bit underscore hell yeah underscore
underscore asks do you ever think of
dyeing your hair dark again um I don't
think I would ever go dark again my
natural hair color although it looks
dark in contrast to the blond my natural
hair color is like a sandy light brown
or a mousy light brown dark blonde kind
of color but I don't think I would ever
go dark again just because I find blond
just suits me more and it's just it's
just me like I just I associate myself
with having lighter hair so Lexi Hart's
beauty asks would you rather live on a
beach or in the city I would rather live
on the beach personally I love the city
I live downtown right now which I'm sure
you guys can tell from my window because
you'll just hear cars and like horns and
sirens but I do I love the city but I
would much rather live on the beach and
just drive into the city if I needed to
so Chris RG asks how do you stay happy
and positive all the time love you so
much kisses from Spain that's really
cool that you're from Spain I'm jealous
I might be going to Spain soon actually
so that should be exciting but I don't
stay happy and positive all the time
it's just I try to make myself stay that
way as much as possible but everybody
has
days and everybody has negative days
where you're just feeling really
pessimistic everybody has that but when
it comes to staying positive or trying
your best to stay positive and happy all
the time just constantly remind yourself
that you are just a tiny little dot on
earth that's spinning around the Sun in
a universe that is infinite and so our
problems aren't really that big of a
deal and if that doesn't help then just
try and focus on the things that are
good in life or try and keep your
blinders on well not necessarily your
blinders because it's always good to
still be aware of what's going on around
the world but just try to focus your
intent and your in energy and all of
that on what's good and what you have
and not what you don't have and rot
what's going wrong and then you'll
notice that when you're focusing on
those things more your life just seems
to be a lot less stressful and a lot
less negative and you'll feel a lot more
happy and more positive and if you're
just kind of always trying to find the
good in everything it's a you have to
kind of train your mind to think that
way especially if you're constantly a
very pessimistic point of view or trying
to remember how infinitely small we are
and that none of this matters and the
point of life is just to live and be
happy so yeah Rachael dot Plamen asks do
you and Ryan expect to get engaged
anytime in the near future I would say
no I would say no just for the reason
that we'll get engaged when we get
engaged and we'll get married when we
get married but if there's no rush on
life and I would say I'm only 21
Rize 25 so he's a little bit older but
I'm only 21 and I feel like both of us
have had this conversation and we both
just want to live a lot more life not
that marriage stops you from living life
but I think we're still discovering more
about ourselves as individuals and we're
still discovering more about our
relationship every day so I feel like we
both agree on the fact that we'll get
engaged someday yeah but I mean there is
no rush for us to get there and there's
still so much other things that we could
be doing or other things that we can
still explore and do together and a
certificate that says you're married to
somebody isn't that big of a deal to the
both of us so I think
I'll get engaged when you get engaged I
can't really put a timeline on a Sabrina
underscore OLN asks could you spend the
rest of your life living with someone
who eats animal products greetings and
love from Switzerland again I am so
jealous that you are in Switzerland um
the way I see it is I'm a vegan for my
own beliefs and my own passion and I
can't force that upon anybody all I can
do is just educate anyone that wants to
know or just tell everybody my story or
what I found and I can't force anybody
else to do the same thing so in Ryan's
case Ryan eats accredit he isn't vegan
that said he's kind of like looked into
it a little bit more and I really
respect that Ryan is someone that's
looked into it and researched it and
kind of plays around with the idea so I
mean we'll see what we can do but I mean
he respects my choices and my what I've
decided to do and he respects that I'm
vegan so I respect that he isn't and
that's all you can do in life you got to
live and you got to let live and you can
educate people and things may not be
black and white right or wrong I believe
being vegan is like the right thing to
do and it's just something I'm really
passionate about and I will educate him
and tell him as much as I can but it's
his choice in life so I I would
definitely be able to stay with him but
I would probably keep putting little
pointers and little education in along
the way so Meghan daf-16 asks what's
your favorite what's your best advice
for staying fit and active through the
summer I love you so much my best advice
for staying active through the summer
would be to find a workout especially
since it's summer and it's nice out that
is really fun that you like to do so for
me now that it's really nice out I run
outside and I'll wake up in the morning
and I just go for my run and I have like
a trail that I like to run because it's
nice scenery and it's just so much nicer
to be outside versus running on a
treadmill in a gym staring at a TV
screen and just being beside a stranger
I don't know I just I like the gym I
prefer to be outside though so now that
it's nicer whether go hiking go kayaking
go running go jogging play some beach
volleyball just
find some exercises that are fun and
there outdoors and that will help keep
you active during the summer
arrey adult lash asked me to say I love
you array out in my Q&amp;amp;A video so how do
I yeah sorry if I'm saying your name
wrong and I love you
so somebody about Calista Saunders asks
why I switched snapchats and if you guys
don't already know
I switched snapchats over from Kalin XO
13 to Kandla Nicholson which I'll put
right here so this is my snapchat logo
now and the reason why I actually
changed it is because I'm trying to
create a little bit more uniform and
through all of my platforms so Kayla
Nicholson is obviously my platform on
most other things other than Instagram
so instead of using kiln X of 13 I
decided to flip over to Kaelin Nicholson
that way it's a lot easier to find me
and yeah that's pretty much it so Nadia
monserrate asks if you could travel
anywhere over the world for free where
would it be
that's a really hard question because
there's so many different places that I
want to travel to but right now I've
been toying around with the idea of
going to Thailand I just really want to
go to Thailand I would love to go to the
Thailand fruit 5x so Tyler XO asks if
you could make any animal hybrid what
would you make I would make an elephant
sea turtle cuz those are my two favorite
animals that would be a really
weird-looking animal but that would be a
wicked cool animal so kaity gaurin JH x
asks if you had to choose between
mascara and hate hair straighteners for
those for your life which would you
choose I would definitely choose mascara
if you guys haven't noticed lately I've
been letting my hair just kind of go
naturally I don't really know the last
time I used a hair straightener I'm
trying to get my hair to be really
healthy and just lately I've been
feeling if you guys haven't noticed even
on my makeup I've just been going a lot
more kind of subtle or natural and just
not feeling the need to put on a full
face every time I film or not feeling
the need to put on a full face every day
or do my hair everyday it's just I feel
like it started to get to the point that
I was I felt insecure if I didn't do a
full face of makeup and do my hair so
I'm changing that by you know let my
hair go natural and trying up new things
and just letting it dry or just kind of
doing a more subtle makeup on my face
so that
is why I would say mascara because
mascara is probably the one thing I put
on almost every day so underscore
Brittany Buckley underscore asks when
you're having a rough day what is
something you do that immediately makes
you feel better there's it all depends
on the type of day that I'm having one
thing that can a hundred percent make me
feel so much better is Bentley it sounds
so cliche or whatever but first of all
Bentley doesn't like when I cry if I cry
he attacks my face because he really
doesn't like it and just in general
he'll just do something cute or even
there's been times where I'm having like
an anxiety attack and I'm on the ground
and he is like clawing at my hair and
I'm I can't breathe but when I do
finally kind of register and get get
back to like kind of calm again I can't
help but start like giggling because
he's just so freaking cute and so
Bentley without a doubt can always make
me feel better and also journaling so my
journal just sometimes just sitting down
and like with a cup of tea or coffee or
whatever and just writing out everything
that's weighing me down inside it just
makes me feel so much better especially
because I'm not somebody that very
easily goes to people when I'm upset or
it goes to people when something's
bothering me I like to like kind of
harbour any everything inside and so
sometimes sitting down and just writing
it all out and getting it down on paper
not only helps me figure out what's
bothering me but it also just helps me
get it out and off my chest without
having to necessarily do it to somebody
or tell somebody what's going on because
I know that sounds bad but I just I'm
somebody that doesn't like to talk about
my problems a lot so yeah so journaling
and Bentley
so underscore Oh Theresa asks who's your
celebrity crush and sorry Rui but it
would have to be Charlie Hunnam or Jax
teller from Sons of Anarchy he is
slightly attractive
Courtney Hatcher asks what are your
thoughts on gay rights this might create
some controversy but I believe you
should be able to love whoever the heck
you want to love and I don't see it
hurting anybody I think it's amazing
that it just got legalized recently and
Erica and I think that you should just
live and let live and somebody loving
somebody doesn't all underneath all we
all are are skeletons and we are not our
bodies we live inside of our bodies and
so I believe that you should be able to
love whoever you want to love and you
should be able to be with whoever you
want to be with so dizzy Emily asks when
you were younger what did you want to be
when you grew up I actually wanted to be
a teacher I love kids and I love the
organization and I used to play teacher
all the time like go up on the board and
pretend that I was like you know teacher
and I always saw myself as like a great
- teacher I don't know what it was with
great twos but it was something about
grade two that I just really wanted to
be a great teacher
so kayla marie tree which is my old
instagram / a fan account as what's your
favorite thing about being on youtube
and my favorite thing about being on
youtube is 100% no word of a lie not
just saying this it's you guys like just
the fact that I get to create and
there's people that are somehow willing
to watch it or want to watch it or love
to watch it the fact that I'm able to do
what I love and inspire others and just
and just have the creative ability to
just make videos for you guys it's just
so cool and and commenting back and
forth with you guys and and getting your
guys's messages where it says you know
like a major day or I saved your life or
inspired you to start living healthier
just be positive or to go out and live
and do fun things and learn more about
yourself and and be a better person and
it's for that reason and the fact that
you guys are all here and there's six
hundred somewhat odd thousand of you
it's completely mind-blowing to me still
blows my mind my dad texts me every day
just to let me know how many more
subscribers I get a day and we both are
just like blown away that there's that
many people fact that there's that many
people every single day that are
constantly coming to this channel and
subscribing and wanting to watch more
and see more and just that makes me want
to be a better person not only for
myself but for you guys and that said I
guess I'll just throw this in on the
little end
end of this video I guess so there are
going to be some changes on my YouTube
and just all of my platforms and all of
that I just
long story short went through just a bad
boat or a bad kind of phase recently
where I was just really really depressed
and unmotivated and I just didn't know
what was wrong and I realized that I
just that was my mind and my body trying
to tell me that I wasn't living the way
I should or it wasn't doing what I
wanted to really do I was doing what I
felt I had to do and I was doing and
creating the things I thought people
would want to see or that I had to make
and that's not why I started this I
started doing YouTube because a I love
it and I've always just loved to create
and I love video videography and all
that but I love doing YouTube for the
sake of inspiring you guys and I'm not
saying that like I'm better than you
guys or that my life should inspire you
because you guys inspire me every single
day but it's just I want to be part of
the change in the world as corny as that
sounds I guess I kind of want to be part
of the better and I want to be I want to
be better for you guys in the sense that
I want my videos to leave you guys
happier and inspired and I want you guys
to learn to love yourselves and to live
into I don't know it's just I don't know
I don't really know how to explain it to
you guys but long story short you're
gonna be seeing a lot more about the
things I'm passionate about and the
things that I really believe in and not
so much the things that I think I have
to create for you guys and I really hope
that you guys are okay with that and you
guys are excited about that because I am
I'm gonna be showing you guys more vegan
stuff I'm gonna be showing you guys more
living and more advice and inspiration
and and not be creating videos that I
know I don't even really like and I know
they aren't my best work but I'll put
them up because they think that's what
you guys want to see you guys subscribe
to my channel and I'm assuming because
you guys want to see more of my videos
and you guys want to see more of me and
I can't give you guys more of me if I'm
giving you guys kind of like a false
illusion of me if that makes any sense
whatsoever so basically long story short
you
have inspired me in so many more ways
than you will ever know and one of them
is that I need to be more confident in
Who I am
long story short I'm gonna be doing more
weekly vlogs so you guys get to see you
more my day-to-day life and how kind of
boring I am I guess um I'm not someone
that likes to go out and party all the
time I'm not somebody that needs to be
in a big group of people to be honest
with you I'm somebody that prefers to
kind of stay in and hang out with a
couple good friends or kind of be lazy
or relaxed or would rather go for a walk
then go to a club do you know what I
mean like I guess you're gonna be seeing
more of that so you're gonna be seeing
my recipes more vegan things more
inspiration for life and just fashion
and all this stuff that I really really
love are gonna be the things that you're
gonna see more so let me know what you
guys want to see down below what things
you guys want to see of my life and what
things I can bring to the table for you
guys
and I will start doing the ones that
make sense for me and I'm gonna stop
doing the videos that don't really make
sense for me if that makes any sense I
just said makes sense a lot hope you
guys are excited to see new videos and
more real me and not so much I'm doing
this because I think I have to me so I'm
really excited and I'm really happy this
is probably the happiest I've felt in a
really long time about it so yeah I just
thank you guys so much every single day
more than you will ever ever know for
everything you guys do and just for
being who you guys are and inspiring me
to be a better person and inspiring me
to do more and want more and believe
more so now that all that corny stuff is
out of the way thank you guys for
watching I hope you guys enjoyed this QA
if you want a part too or if you want
more Q&amp;amp;A just thumbs up this video and I
will make a new Q&amp;amp;A soon and other than
that I will see you guys all in a future
