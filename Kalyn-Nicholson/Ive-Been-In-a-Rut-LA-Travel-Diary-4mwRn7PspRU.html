hey guys and welcome back to my channel
I am currently in Los Angeles
I decided that the best way to kind of
regain motivation and perspective for me
is usually when I come back from a trip
so one three am plane trip and about a
couple days later Here I am let's just
start with the fact that I'm running off
of an hour and a half of sleep last
night I just could not sleep food-wise
me oh so excited so each hour just kept
ticking by excited to sleep for like an
hour and a half slept through my alarm
was so flippin late
absolutely I had to literally Ricky
Bobby to Ottawa doesn't really matter
because I jumped the plane I did all the
things I needed to do and hearing him so
I'm about to go meet up with Katie again
I feel like you guys know who katie is
at this point but just in case adult at
a cinnamon Dolce latte she put me onto
this and I don't know what I've been
doing at Starbucks I also love that
we're wearing sunglasses inside right
now I'm also going to see Jenna and
basically just a bunch of people that I
met in the summertime when I did my la
vlog when I was packing last night I was
literally in the best mood Scooby does a
general idea of what that looked like
and now that you guys clearly entertain
let's go out on the town
so I'm currently in such a rush I have
to leave like yesterday to go to a
festival I just ordered uber eat fat
burger because I've always really wanted
to try fat burger truly decided this
like an hour ago so we're going to go
see like little lane at Tyler the
Creator basically is gonna be a super
chill night and watch it
that's my
I'm back at my Airbnb right now so I
decided to go for an adventure I walked
all the way to Santa Monica
and did like the pier and did some
shopping I live streamed with you guys
on the beach like don't get me wrong I
love traveling alone but I feel like
there should be shirts we should wear
shirts that's like I'm looking for a
friend please say hi I have two
different friends that I'm talking to
right now that I might go meet but I
don't know I also I totally forgot to
tell you guys this earlier but the clips
you guys saw from the first night I was
here casually was sipping on a drink
while standing like pretty much right
beside Taylor Lautner it was a struggle
because I was like like literally you
have no idea you were a poster on my
wall for like three years I was so team
Jacob not for Bella I was team Jacob for
me and then the festival we went to
yesterday was just like so random and
like unplanned and it's just like fall
together so nicely you know so I'm kind
of hoping tonight is gonna be a night
like that and I'm back look we just need
to have a life chat here so sorry for
all the cars by the way I curled my hair
I had my makeup on I wiped it off which
is why I look like a drowned rat right
now totally relevant to the story of all
the time and energy and effort that I
could into getting into that mindset of
like let's go explore just no no I just
feel like I'm like tucked into bed
talking to you guys or now which
technically I am part of me is like
really upset with myself because I'm
like you just paid all this money to
come to LA and you're just gonna stay in
your Airbnb for the night but another
part of me is like I feel like it needs
to happen
who did the biggest reason I honestly
booked this trip was because I just
needed to get out of my like everyday
routine kind of get inspired by life
again because I've been feeling so
unmotivated and so that's kind of just
led me to here and to be honest I kind
of just think I want to research and
like plan and just get ready for what I
want to accomplish when I get home and
I'm realizing even being on this trip
that as much fun as I've been having I
still feel really like disconnected from
everything I don't want to bring the
people around me down I don't want to
bring you guys down and it's not like
I've been miserable like just like this
thing that sits in the back of my mind I
don't know it's kind of why this trip
happened that's kind of where my mind
sets out I feel like going through
slumps whether it be physically
emotionally
spiritually subconsciously whatever it
is if whatever kind of slump you're
going through like motivation wise
inspiration wise it kind of forces you
to change and to switch up your
environment and it forces you to kind of
research new things and get inspired by
things that you obviously aren't already
doing I feel a lot of change is about to
start happening for me this video has
been the first video out in over two
weeks like it's obvious not talking
about it has made it faster in me so
much that it's like overflowing in other
areas of my life and it just needs to
stop it it's done I'm done with it I
have my day planner and my laptop and
everything here so I think I'm just
gonna like kind of plan the next few
weeks for when I get home and also work
on dreamcatcher and just like go on
YouTube and just kind of have a chill
night life isn't always like crazy music
festivals and parties actually my life
is like never really ever crazy music
festivals and parties unless I'm
traveling I think it's hilarious that
I'm just like laying in bed with you
guys right now so yeah that's my life
update it feels good to just tell you
guys and just be upfront and honest with
you guys because now I feel like you
guys know why I've been so like off the
freaking radar for like two weeks
Sunday night Airbnb la things you know
you're a catalyst to your own happiness
you know cuz it's your heart it's a life
it's pumping blood
it's your heart it's pumping and my blog
camera is at 3% which really sucks I'm
hoping it's going to last long enough to
make it through lunch but I'm actually
at my network's headquarters hopefully
hopefully fingers crossed that this
camera isn't going to die before that
happened
and I'll use lobby entrance alright I
think I'm finding my way so I'm gonna go
say hi to everybody and then Katie and I
are gonna head out
we have to Jordan in his natural habitat
while Jordan a wild Jordan a real life
while Jo he spotted us
run so my trip in LA is finally coming
to a close when to Beverly Hills like
visited my work office which was so cool
to finally put like kind of like a
vision to it and I hung out with Katy
for my last day which was like
bittersweet we went to Nike I bought
this sweater that I'm wearing on the
plane she bought the matching one
because why not we're sisters I mean if
you guys want to join us buy the same
sweater it's at Nike right now a red eye
it's probably gonna suck flying
overnight but I think I'm just gonna
like hype myself up on a lot of caffeine
and work on dreamcatcher
I loved this trip but it did exactly
what I needed it to in the sense that it
really reset me and I'm just ready to go
home get like going on my priority list
just kind of like get back into a new
routine yes guys it's time to go home
night
who's ready for some napped oh he's the
best they look like a drowned rat but I
am home and I'm so tired I've been awake
for over 24 hours now so I am about to
climb into this bed with that little
rascal and sleep for like all of
eternity hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope you guys are excited that
videos are coming back and for those of
you guys that don't follow my Twitter
there's going to be a new video on
Friday as well and other than that I'll
see you guys on my next video bye guys
I'm gonna go sleep forever and ever and
ever
