much hey guys so for today's video I am
doing my June obsessions so basically
I'm just gonna share with you guys some
things that I've been obsessing with
lately over the month of June and a
little bit into May as well and yeah I'm
just gonna share with you guys like all
the random stuff that I have been loving
lately how normally I know these videos
are kind of more subject to like makeup
tutorials or a makeup sorry makeup
products and like hair products and all
that stuff but I think because I changed
it to obsessions I'm literally just
gonna show you really random things that
I've been obsessed with so hopefully
y'all don't mind and yeah so this is all
going to be really random but the first
thing I have to show you guys is this
the little book of yoga and I actually
picked this up at Urban Outfitters it
was I'm one of those people that when
you're in the line out kind of like line
the aisles with random things in hopes
that you'll buy it just to throw in a
couple extra dollars of your money to
their business I am a sucker for those
things so this was in a little like
lineup area and I was totally pulled in
and suckered into buying it but it's
this little book of yoga and as you guys
know I've been really obsessed with yoga
lately and trying to get back into it
and all that stuff so basically it's a
book that has Illustrated it's an
illustrated directory of more than 35
classic yoga poses it kind of gives you
like a brief history behind yoga and its
roots and its philosophy the basics of
breathing and meditation with exercises
and it's just like basically the simple
basics and everything you would need to
know about yoga is in this little book
here and then you obviously can get into
more advanced yoga and all of that stuff
so anyway I picked up this book and I
just started to like read into the
history behind yoga and I find that
stuff really interesting I'm I'm like a
weird dork when it comes to history I
find like especially really really
really far back history I just find it
very entertaining and very interesting
and I just like to gobble it all up
especially things that I'm really
passionate about like yoga finding out
kind of the history behind it is so
interesting to me and if you guys are
looking to get interested in yoga and
meditation
hurt to pick this book up because you'll
learn a lot about the background history
and how it really can affect the mind
and and all of that stuff so yes this is
the little book of yoga that I have been
obsessed with and next I'm deciding to
throw this in with into this video
because I am obsessed with it but I also
get a lot of questions about it and it
is my laptop little cover thing I guess
that's upside down so this is my laptop
this is the little like cover that I
have on it and I also when you open up
my laptop don't mind whatever my screen
saver is right now but I have it on the
inside as well so I've been getting a
lot of questions any time that might be
laptop is in any videos or pictures as
to what the heck is on my laptop because
it's a lot going on and it's really
cool-looking so actually when I was in
New York I saw laurdiy his laptop and
she has like a cool sticker on it
something started similar hers has
completely different pictures but I was
staring at it and I was like okay how
the heck did you do that that is really
cool and she told me that she went on
some random website up she didn't
remember the what the website was but
basically just made a stencil and it
gets sent to you and you stick it on
your laptop so thanks to her I went home
and went surfing onto the interweb and
found a website I believe it was called
decal girl but I'll leave the actual
link to the website down below and
anyway I just did like a google search
and found this random website and I went
on to my weak-hearted account and if you
guys don't follow me I'll leave that
down below too but it basically just has
a bunch of really fun inspirational
pictures and I picked out a bunch of fun
ones that I really liked but I also
threw some in there that are actually my
own like this picture of Bentley in this
picture of this pineapple here so I just
put pieced together a bunch of pictures
that I like and really inspire me and
just kind of like tell a little bit
about myself or the things that I like
so and then I just made it into a
collage and then I uploaded the collage
as one solid picture so you have to make
the collage first and then upload it
together as one picture and then you get
it printed out you can just do the top
and then you there's an option if you
want to do the inside as well but you
can choose to just do it over the top
layer so that is a little laptop decal
sticker thing that I got and I'll leave
the link to it down below so you guys
don't have to keep asking anymore so now
know how I made that it also I'm sure
you guys won't be surprised to find that
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil has been
an obsession of mine lately it actually
does smell like hot chocolate which is a
an added bonus when you're adding it to
your face because it just smells like
cocoa is everywhere but this has been my
obsession not only for contouring and
just like breath bronzing my face but I
also use it as my crease color my
starting base to my eyeshadow every day
so this has been my life probably one of
my makeup go-to s and one of the things
that I'll always restock so another
thing that I have been obsessed weekly
with so another thing I've been obsessed
with lately is kind of like fake nails I
guess I'm not really a big fake nail
person because I hate when they're so
long that I can't do anything like I
can't play guitar and I can't watch my
hair and I can't put on makeup cuz my
nails are too long but I have really
brittle short really thin nails all the
time so I picked up these ones from
Walmart and I think there were only like
six or eight dollars I don't remember
but they were relatively cheap and these
ones you don't even need glue because
it's just that simple and I'm just way
too lazy to glue my nails on anyway so
they're actually stick ons I'm wearing
some right now these are the red ones
but I was wearing the pink ones in my
party video and in other videos and
pictures so I got them a baby pink and
in red and they come in like these
little nail-polish container looking
things oh that one's upside down there
we go and the best part is is look at
how short they are they barely are
longer than my actual real nails so it
doesn't feel like I'm wearing fake nails
and I can still play the guitar and do
things with fake nails so these I've
been my obsession lately since I can't
grow nice looking nails I just throw on
a couple of these and they stay on for I
would say probably about a week before
they start falling off and I'm sure you
guys know this already too but the air
is finally out and if you guys watch my
second channel you'll know that the
selection series it's a book series is
my all-time favorite probably book
series to date one of them anyway
so I finally got to pick up the air
because it came out and I'm almost done
reading it but this book is a
so if you guys haven't read the
selection series I would suggest reading
that but even if you haven't you could
technically pick this book up because
it's kind of like it's a storyline
against like another character but it's
still so good just just trust me just
read them they're so good but anyway if
you'll have read the selection series
the air is now out and it is really
really worth the read so I highly
suggest picking this up because this
book has been my obsession like
everything all the time
anything I talk about I'm like oh my
gosh that reminds me of the air or like
watching The Bachelor I don't like this
reminds me of the air because it's kind
of got that bit of a storyline to it but
anyway I don't want to give too much
away but this has been my book obsession
for this month and now that it's summer
I've been really obsessed with like bold
bright lip colors and my favorite for
this month was probably this one is in
fuchsia flash by Maybelline and it's
just this really hot pink magenta color
and I love doing just kind of like
subtle eyes it's just like a little bit
of mascara maybe a little bit of like a
bronze but like matte bronze and then
just going crazy on the lips with a
super bright hot pink color I just find
it so summery and fun and that has just
been like my go-to look lately and also
I've been breaking out a little bit more
than usual on my face so I've been using
my Olay fresh effects clear skin acne
hater deep scrub and I usually only use
a deep scrub probably every three days I
would say because you don't want to
scrub away all of the like moisture and
the good stuff that's on your skin so I
have been exfoliating probably I would
say every three days just to get rid of
any dead skin cells especially being
outside in the Sun and stuff your skin
can get really dry so using like an acne
scrub like this will get rid of any
extra makeup you might have on your face
and just all the dead skin cells and
really clean out your pores so I've been
trying my best to get into a better
habit of taking care of my skin lately
so I've been using a scrub on my face
just to like clear off any excess crap
that's just sitting on my skin and as
you guys know I have an obsession with
the elephant pants and I've talked about
them before but I actually have a new
obsession and it's shorts these are
still by the same company the elephant
pants but they are actually
the short version that came out with
shorts and let me tell you I thought the
pants are amazing but the shorts are
even better because when it's really
really hot or humid out you don't want
to wear pants these aren't perfect
they're so stretchy and comfy and the
prints are so fun and they're just like
my go-to to put on when I just don't
know what to wear but I want to be comfy
especially like at the cottage or than
just like walking around town and I just
want to be comfortable and I don't want
to wear jeans because nobody in their
right mind ever actually wants to wear
jeans these are my go-to and they're so
comfy and I kind of wear them a little
high-waisted with just like a nice crop
top and maybe a cardigan if it's a
little chillier or just the crop top
itself but anyway these are the elephant
shorts and they have really fun prints
and really big pockets and they're just
so cute and so comfy and another thing
I've been loving lately has been my Kwai
Australia sunglasses so I decided I've
never really invested in like a nicer
pair of sunglasses before so I decided
to kind of treat myself and get myself a
pair actually I got two pairs but this
one has been my favorite I'm not sure
what the style is called or anything
like that so I'll leave a link if I can
find them down below but these have been
my favorite ones they have like a little
bit of their circle but they have like a
cat eye up at the top and then they have
just a bar going across and they are
like the polarized ones so they're
reflected and they have like a bluey
green type of color and yeah so these
have been like my go-to throw on
sunglasses especially when I'm wearing a
lot of black and the next thing I have
to show you guys is this necklace here
and if you guys follow me on social
media you will have seen it before but
this is from stargaze jewelry and it's
one of those crystal necklaces and I got
it and I believe it was white jade and I
think I was actually wearing this dress
too when I posted the picture which is
really funny but this has been my like
favorite type of accessory lately it's
just like a dainty little necklace and I
love the crystal on it so this has been
probably my favorite and most worn
accessory for this month and another
thing I have been obsessed with is
Perrier water and I just recently
started getting into this because if you
guys have been watching my videos for
long timeyou low i have a type pepsi
obsession just a little bit and i've
been trying to kick it lately so instead
of drinking Pepsi I drink Perrier and
it's carbonated natural spring water and
they come in different flavors but you
can get a plain but I prefer flavored
but this one's lemon and it's probably
the one I would say I would purchase
most but they also have lime and I
believe they also have like grapefruit
or something random like that and
sometimes I'll even throw some like
fresh fruit in there itself but I just
drink it out of the bottle when I'm
feeling really lazy and it's just a
really good like good drink to have if
you're not a big water person I actually
am a big water person but I just find
this is just a lot funner than just
getting water all the time and it just
has like a little bit of flavor to it so
that it gives that extra kick and I
still miss my diet Pepsi but this is so
pretty damn good so I highly suggest you
guys are trying to like kick anything
like soda or pop or whatever to just
pick up Perrier water because it's
carbonated so it still gives you that
carbonated taste but it's not full of
aspartame and all that other stuff so
that pretty much concludes everything
for my favorites for the month
I will leave my newest 8 tracks playlist
down below because that has a lot of my
favorite songs for this month and other
than that I guess that's pretty much it
thank you guys so much for watching I
have a lot of really fun content coming
for you guys soon and lots of not only
just videos but like blog posts and just
there's gonna be a lot of changes coming
soon and um I'm not going to explain now
because I would make this video just
super super long but I will be putting
out a video either to this channel or to
my second channel just kind of
explaining my recent life like what's
been going on all up in my head and all
the things that I want to change and
just some fun stuff and I'm really
excited about it and I'm hoping you guys
will be really excited about it too but
anyway long story short I'm not gonna
get super into it right now so just
watch out for that video because there
is going to be lots of fun changes and
just just a lot of different stuff
coming out and I'm just really excited
for it so but yeah so thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
guys all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
