countdown I am doing something really
fun and really exciting I wanted to give
back to you guys this holiday season as
part of my Christmas countdown this year
I've been doing the videos every day
which I hope you guys have been liking
but I definitely wanted to do a video
that I could kind of give back to you
guys so there are going to be two
giveaways going on one on my channel and
one on my Twitter and this is going to
be the day I believe it's day 15 of
Christmas countdown which is really
exciting it's kind of crazy to think
that I've been doing videos every day
since December 5th but and the fact that
we're 5 days away from Christmas
I feel like Christmas literally just
like came out of nowhere and just
surprise attack all of us so I wanted to
get this video out in time so that you
guys could enter before you guys get all
crazy busy on Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day and I'm going to be
choosing the winner on December 31st so
that it's like the winner is decided
just before the new year so it's kind of
like whoever gets to win either prize
gets a nice start to the new year so
basically I'm going to be sharing with
you guys what I'm going to be giving
away on my YouTube and on my Twitter and
then I'll share with you guys how to
enter and basically the rules so as for
the YouTube giveaway what I'm going to
be giving away on YouTube is first off I
went and got one of these gift sets from
Sephora it is the tarte high-performance

little minis so you will be getting this
tart if sent with all full-size products
inside next you'll also be getting a
Starbucks gift card worth $25 and then
the biggest part of this giveaway is
you're going to be getting a iPad Mini
and this is a silver or white I'm not
sure I'm pretty sure it's silver and
it's the iPad Mini and it's the 16 gig
so that is going to be the first prize
for YouTube and then as for the Twitter
give away the prize for Twitter is also
going to be another one of these turns
of gift boxes as well as another $25
Starbucks gift card so to enter the
YouTube giveaway all you have to do is

Year's resolution now if you are just
going to be commenting down below a
bunch of random like letters and numbers

just be sure that you actually write a
New Year's resolution down below and you
can enter as many times as you want just
go ahead and leave all different kinds
of New Year's resolutions down in the
comment section and again just be sure
that you are subscribed to my channel

YouTube giveaway and I'll be picking the
winner on December 31st at random and

the tweet and retweet it and again I'll
just be choosing a retweet ur at random
and just making sure that they follow me

one or the other you can take your
chance at both of them so this giveaway
