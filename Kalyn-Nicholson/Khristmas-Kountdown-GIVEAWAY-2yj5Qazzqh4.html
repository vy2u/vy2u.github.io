countdown I am doing something really
fun and really exciting I wanted to give
back to you guys this holiday season as
part of my Christmas countdown this year
I've been doing the videos every day
which I hope you guys have been liking
but I definitely wanted to do a video
that I could kind of give back to you
guys so there are going to be two
giveaways going on one on my channel and
one on my Twitter and this is going to
be the day I believe its day 15 of
Christmas countdown which is really
exciting it's kind of crazy to think
that I've been doing videos every day
since December fifth but and the fact
that we're five days away from Christmas
I feel like Christmas literally just
like came out of nowhere and just
surprise attack all of us so I wanted to
get this video out in time so that you
guys could enter before you guys get all
crazy busy on Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day and I'm going to be
choosing the winner on December 31st so
that it's like the winner is decided
just before the new year so it's kind of
like whoever gets to win either prize
gets a nice start to the new year so
basically i'm going to be sharing with
you guys what i'm going to be giving
away on my youtube and on my Twitter and
then i'll share with you guys how to
enter and basically the rules so as for
the YouTube giveaway what I'm going to
be giving away on YouTube is first off I

starbucks gift card worth twenty-five
dollars and then the biggest part of
this giveaway is you're going to be
getting a ipad mini and this is a silver

of these turns of gift boxes as well as
another $25 starbucks gift card so to

want just go ahead and leave all
different kinds of new year's
resolutions down in the comment section
