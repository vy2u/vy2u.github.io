to my channel for the 26th day of u
Tober it is currently Thursday and for
those of you guys that might be heading
out to some last-minute Halloween
parties this weekend which literally
actually happened to me today's video is
going to be a bunch of last-minute
Halloween costumes that you can throw
together on the spot in case
spur-of-the-moment you decide to say
adios to scary movies in popcorn and
actually attend an event that set for
those of you guys that are just gonna
stay home on Halloween movies and eat
popcorn you can you can still dress up
in fact I've done it every year we only
think of you guys alcohol and we already
be sure to check out my Twitter in my
Instagram where you may have seen this
prior to have seen in this video also
make sure you subscribe and hit the
notification bell so you guys know
whenever a video goes up and aside from
that if you guys want to know some fast
and easy last-minute Halloween costumes
then just keep watching
so first things first when it comes to a
great last-minute Halloween costume is
being a bedhead because one you get to
wear your PJs you know outside and it's
socially acceptable and two it's comfy
and it's easy and pretty much anyone can
do it I just went through my normal
foundation routine you could do
realistically any kind of makeup you
want but I decided to do very like you
know chill and natural looking makeup
almost like the barely-there makeup so I
just went through my normal Foundation
filled in my brows and then did some
subtle contouring of my eyes with a like
beige or a brown put on a little bit of
mascara and a neutral lip and that was
pretty much it
to finish off the look I decided to do a
very subtle contour of just my face and
then put on a fresh coat of mascara and
I decided to skip the lashes for this
costume because I feel like most people
probably don't have the bushiest
eyelashes crawling out of bed and then
once that was done I just curled my hair
into good like toss old bed head kind of
curls and all I did for that was take a
one and a half inch curling wand
kro my hair hold it in place for a few
seconds and then let it drop and then
shake it out and hairspray it then for
the costume itself you could wear
pajamas or a robe like I did throw on
some slippers specifically ones that you
could potentially wear out of the house
and then you can put an eye mask around
your head just so you know it kind of
like completes the look and if you do
decide to drink that night you could
always drink out of a mug too just to
complete the whole costume the next
costume that I threw together was just a
basic chick so all I did for this was
the exact same makeup as before only
this time I added lashes just to make it
a little bit more extra this costume
could go so many different ways like you
could definitely wear all different
types of clothing I decided to pair on a
pink adidas hoodie some pink leggings
from Victoria's Secret and then you
could wear like hunter boots you could
wear sneakers you could do UGG style
boots carry around like a Starbucks mug
carry around a small like stuffed puppy
there's so many different ways you could
do this but I just thought it'd be a
funny little costume to do plus it's
kind of like low-key roasting myself
because I am actually quite basic
this is low-key like a roast yourself
costume and if all else fails on your
last minute Halloween costume why not
just you know go ahead and beat your dog
so again for this you can do your
everyday makeup and then I just threw on
some lashes again and then I'm just
taking a it's actually a liquid lipstick
but I'm creating a little dog nose on my
the tip of my nose creating a line down
to my lips and then using black lipstick
since most dogs don't have like you know
pink lips and then I added just a few
whiskers and some dog ears they're
actually fox ears that I found from the
drugstore but you could get any kind of
dog ears from a Halloween store a dollar
store I've been seeing them everywhere
so and then for those of you guys out
there that don't have a dog I mean feel
free to be Bentley for Halloween all you
have to do is put on the dog makeup put
on the dog ears and then just wear an
orange sweater and you're pretty much
and then of course a costume that
everyone can do is just literally be a
dead version of yourself all I did was
take some foundation a few skin tones
lighter than I actually am to make my
skin look kind of dull and dead and then
I just went through that did my
highlight with a concealer filled in my
brows but then when it came to doing
eyeshadow I chose very kind of cool
toned Browns and created a super super
dramatic smoky eye bringing it all the
way into the inner parts of my nose and
also contouring my face with the same
colors this just kind of created like a
dead like adult deadness to my skin
that's the only way I can think of to
describe
as for the lips I used whatever
concealer was left on my Beauty Blender
and just kind of smudged that into my
lips to blend them into the rest of my
skin and then I just used a purple tone
to eyeshadow to go on the inner parts of
my lips added a few coats of mascara and
then while that dried I just took a blue
eyeliner and kind of touched up on the
lips again to create kind of like the
dead you know when someone dies they say
that their lips turned blue that's kind
of what I was going for with the blue
eyeliner and then smudge that into my
lips a little bit before adding some
lashes and calling it again now for this
costume you could wear pretty much
anything you want but I just felt like
wearing all black made more sense and I
wore a dress that kind of had like a
ripped up texture to it and then a
distressed leather jacket and that was
it and then last but not least I am
going to do a scarecrow so I basically
just did the exact same Dead makeup that
I did before except this time I added a
little patched nose to the tip of my
nose and then put on some black lipstick
and created a stitching smile across the
lips as well and then added a little
patch on my face so again you don't have
to do the dead makeup underneath you
could be like a cute scarecrow and do
red lips but I don't know why I just
like the dead kind of vibe to being a
scarecrow
and then to finish off the costume all
you need is a hat and possibly some
plaid and then you could make up the
rest of your costume from there I
decided to throw on at this overalls
corduroy dress that I got from forever
21 just because I thought I had a
scarecrow vibe to it but you could
literally wear whatever you wanted
so that is it for my last minute DIY
