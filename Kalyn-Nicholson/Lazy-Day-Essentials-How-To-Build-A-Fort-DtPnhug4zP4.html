step one without it out it's always
changing into the comfiest clothes
possible puffy clothes are like dear to
me as my assistant moving on it that's
to wash your face pump suck oh my god
so they're buying little fields right
though son leads me to step 3 which is
putting on a face mask because
everything about having a green face
masks on
while you watch a movie feels right Kent
and now for the fun part or the very
interesting part it depends on how this
all goes that's over for I will cheer
for

we should name it should be for Benson
lot or if you guys could think of a
better team for my fort we'll leave it
down below couple fort rules no adulting
you're not allowed to do any adulting in
the fort you have to reject all things
that make you an adult after wear
pajamas you have to eat all the
unhealthy food
pretty much best set up ever
best idea ever could be Manu hang spot
lala land if you guys haven't seen it
it's the new movie with Emma Stone and
Ryan Gosling it's probably one of my new
favorites for those of you guys that
haven't seen it it's basically about
like two actors that are trying to make
it that like fall in love and like their
drink they like they build up on each
other's dreams but they also like tear
each other off so freaking good plus
anything with Ryan Gosling in it yes
please actually find Emma Stone and Ryan
Gosling would would have made a really
cute couple in real life it's such good
chemistry they've been so many movies
together it's kind of crazy how much
Aloha is definitely one my favorite
actresses do you guys like leave a
comment down below much as I love her

favorite actor it's because I love Ryan
Reynolds I think he's so funny
