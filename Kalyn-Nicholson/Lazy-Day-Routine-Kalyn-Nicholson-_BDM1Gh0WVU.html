trees big hey everyone and welcome back
to my channel for today's video I'm
going to be doing a lazy day routine
with you guys which I don't believe I've
done since May so generally for me I
typically have a lazy day I would say
every single Sunday I like to kind of
keep Sunday scheduled away for just like
getting prepared for like the following
week and planning and cleaning and just
kind of edging out the whole day and
doing my own thing so if you guys want
to see up my lazy day slash Sunday
routine then just keep watching
so Sunday's tend to be my favorite
because they are the one day that I
actually don't set an alarm in the
morning to wake up so I'll sleep in to
whenever my body decides to wake up in
the morning and then once I do get up I
put on my slippers and I go through at
my regular morning routine if you guys
want to see what that is I'll link it
somewhere up on the screen here I just
did that video but like a week and a
half ago but yeah I just like make
myself a coffee sometimes I'll watch
cartoons like Sponge Bob and stuff in
the morning because I'm still 10 years
old and like hang out on the computer
just things like that in the space it's
me
so after my morning coffee the first
thing I like to do on Sundays is spend a
good hour - just cleaning this might
sound really weird but I find it super
therapeutic so I'll light up a bunch of
candles and I'll bring this little
speaker with me pretty much in every
room that I go to clean and then I'll do
dishes
I'll pick like a bigger project every
single Sunday whether it be washing or
like mopping the floors vacuuming
everything Windex and ears things like
that I don't know I just find cleaning
super therapeutic and when I clean on
Sundays it just feels so like nice and
fresh to wake up Monday morning and then
once all my cleaning and laundry is done
I'll typically hang out on my computer
I'll go through like wee hard it tumblr
basically just veg out for the day
watching my favorite shows like Gilmore
Girls movies and just yeah I don't
really do it much throughout the day I
just kind of chill until come nighttime
this is typically when I like to cook
because I can't really cook that much
throughout the week sundays are more of
a big day for like finding something on
pinterest and cooking it and then i'll
usually do a face mask then - so today I
decided to make pierogies and this
pumpkin hummus that I found off of
Pinterest I'll leave the recipe down
below it was super good but yeah and
I'll make like a big big batch of food
on Sunday just so I can kind of munch on
it throughout the week
so the other thing I like to designate
Sundays for are like a full-on pamper
routine so I'll shower I'll usually do
some sort of deep conditioner in the
shower as well and then I'll go ahead
and put on like body butters because my
skin has been getting super dry lately
I'll do like my self tanning routine
just like a face routine do my nails
things like that like poor strips and
things just any sort of pampering thing
that I felt like needs to be done that
week I'll go ahead and do that as well
as just like comb out my hair and I'll
let it air dry for the night and then
once that's all done I like to make
myself a big cup of tea and lately I've
been obsessed with peppermint tea again
and then I'll light some candles and
plan out my week so I know a lot of you
guys been asking about my post-it note
system so I color coordinate the post-it
notes pink is for like personal dark
blue is for work the light blue is for
the overall tasks that might take me
longer than just one day orange is for
emergencies or any sort of events and
then I'll coordinate them on the wall in
terms of weeks so the very very top are
like video ideas overall goals and then
the next three like I said are color
coordinated and that's for a weekly like
overall and then the bottom one is what
I need to get done that day and once
it's done I'll then put it on my
computer as a completed task and then
yeah I go ahead I'll fill out my agenda
for the Monday and then once that's all
done I like to turn out the lights and
spend the rest of my night typically
working on dreamcatcher which could take
me up to like an hour too and then yeah
I just kind of veg and watch some TV
before I go to sleep and on Sundays I
like to try and get to sleep by 11:00
p.m. so that is it for my lazy day
routine I hope you guys enjoyed if you
guys want to see more routine videos
that be sure to thumbs this up and other
than that I will see you guys all in
tomorrow's video bye guys bye
typically when we moved in we know that
this house had been around for very long
rather than both Maggie and I are very
superstitious people so we were like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
