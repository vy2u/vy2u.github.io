go and no place to go home my only
friend was the man and even sometimes he
would go away too
hey guys so for today's of you I wanted
to do something that was a little bit
more different I kind of came up with
the idea of sharing with you guys what I
do on like a lazy day or like a Sunday
routine it's the day that I kind of used
to recoup recharge kind of get some
stuff done and get ready for the week
that's coming ahead and just all of that
kind of stuff now I already know that
I'm probably going to get some comments
that are like oh like this isn't a lazy
day routine like you're not being lazy
you're doing a bunch of stuff but the
thing is is that this is like what I
would consider to be like a lazier day
for me because I don't really tend to
like leave the house on Sunday um I like
kind of staying comfy clothes all day I
don't put makeup on and all of the tasks
and the little things that I do are kind
of considered like lazy to me because I
get like a sense of joy and fulfillment
out of getting like little things done
around the house for the day like
laundry and just kind of spending the
day just quiet in my own head and with
my own thoughts I like watching videos
like this because I find them super
motivational and just really like I
don't know it's kind of like a cozy
video that you can just curl up with cup
of tea or coffee and just kind of watch
somebody do like mundane tasks if that
makes any sense so if you guys want to
see my Sunday routine slash what I do
want like a lazy kind of keep to myself
sort of day then just keep watching
it's so quiet
looks like the calm before the storm
it's getting cold
take my king
way
it's low
so one thing I like to try doing
especially on more chill days and now
that the weather has been nicer is
drinking my coffee outside I find this
kind of nice in the summer time to just
be outside and you know like that was my
phone and just be drinking my coffee and
I normally will sit outside with Bentley
for like an hour too and just kind of
have my breakfast or hang out if you do
carry you
so then once I'm kind of done just
hanging out for the morning I will
usually put on a sort of face mask or a
hair mask or whatever I'm kind of
feeling that day I'm using a the green
tea tea tree oil face mask
I believe from the body shop and then
I'm just putting my conditioner in my
hair and you can do this with coconut
oil too just lather it from like your
ears down so it doesn't make your roots
greasy and then I throw it up in a
topknot
and then this is just kind of like a
nice way to pamper myself in my skin
before I light some candles and then
normally clean my house or my apartment
so this is something that is probably
not really considered lazy but this is
something that I get a lot of enjoyment
out of so I will burn candles all over
my apartment to make the whole place
just smell wicked good and then I will
kind of putt around make my bed I will
do some laundry I will clean my bedroom
I'll clean my office just basically
anywhere around my apartment that kind
of needs to be clean I will go around
and make sure to clean it all or you
know like wash my bedding anything I
really need to get done on at like the
end of the week so yeah I'll just kind
of go to the laundry room take the
garbage out all of that fun stuff
don't you come a bit closer also
normally while this is happening I will
be blaring some tunes really really loud
from my desktop computer so I'll leave
some of my favourite playlist down below
to clean too and all of that
oh I feel your skin feeling skin oh my
oh I feel your skin your skin oh my
yes sir feel your skin so then once I'm
done cleaning all of the things around
my apartment that need to get done I'll
usually just hop in the shower and wash
out the hair mask and the face mask that
I put on earlier and just kind of take
like a super hot shower shave my legs
all of that fun stuff and then from here
on out it's pretty much a like
free-for-all sometimes I will read other
times I might edit or just kind of like
hang out on my computer or write dream
catcher or possibly watch a movie or
watch whatever show I'm watching which
is been One Tree Hill lately so
basically for the rest of the afternoon
slash night I kind of just putt around
and just kind of hang out and just veg
out by myself
I'll also usually probably fold my
laundry Sunday's are 100% my laundry day
so normally Sunday afternoon I always
will try and fold my laundry while
watching a show to make sure that I
don't just kind of leave it unfolded or
else it would stay there forever and
ever but yeah so that's pretty much what
I like to do by the end of the day whoa
your skin
oh I feel your skin your skin on my head
and then last but not least every Sunday
I like to plan out whatever I need to do
for the following week so I'll usually
grab my agenda and my dry erase board
and kind of plan out videos editing
workouts all of that kind of stuff for
the whole week so that was it for my
Sunday routine slash lazy day routine I
hope you guys enjoyed and I'll see you
guys all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
