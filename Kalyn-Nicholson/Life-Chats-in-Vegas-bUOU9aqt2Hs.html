showed up on the plane not cool at all
so dead right now so as I just told you
guys I'm currently in Vegas I'm in like
the coolest hotel room ever I'll give
you guys a tour in a second I've been
awake since 4:30 in the morning and by
4:30 I mean it's 4:30 my time it's like
1:30 in the morning Vegas time so
technically by the time I get to Vegas I
will have been awake since 1:00 a.m. I'm
so tired
so I'm actually in Vegas for the
iHeartRadio Music Festival just super
super exciting I'm gonna have to get
ready soon I'm waiting for my manager to
show up Katie you guys remember her I
will insert some sort of clip here so
you guys can reminisce your brain on who
katie is she is like the best alien to
inhabit earth so waiting for her to get
here and we are going to party like it I
was gonna say 1999 but to be honest I
was 5 so so yeah we're here to party
well I say we're here to party but like
partying for me is like four drinks and
then coming back to the hotel with a
pizza but I would be okay with that
first let me give you guys a tour of
this hotel room I'm welcome to MTV Cribs
this is my career for the weekend this
is a view when you walk in so it's got
like a nice kitchenette area a place to
pregame then we have this beautiful
opening with my bags that I literally
just dropped when I walked in here I
like a tape TV in a desk and then you
come over to this side and it's like
what bedroom this is the bathroom
there's like a clock not a clawfoot tub
I don't know why I said that but there's
like a a tub and a shower and it's just
like look at this place is insane guys
it's crazy now although we could get the
curtains to open currently my mission
but I'll show you guys as you could tell
but I'll show you guys the view from
outside I was trying to mess up with the
curtains and we have Vegas
the notion that anything goes I'm
feeling this motion for part
every time you introduce me I'm always
holding on tonight
so this is needed to happen dude I
cinnamon Dolce latte she put me onto
this and I don't know what I've been
doing at Starbucks I also love that
we're wearing sunglasses inside right
now yeah it's our struggle but ok update
I'm still in Vegas everybody's gone
which is like super kind of depressing
if I'm being honest with you my flight
isn't until midnight tonight so right
now I have the hotel room until 6:00 so
I'm planning on just kind of chillin
last night and the night before super
fun I don't know what Clips I don't
think I've logged as much as I should
have
I loved everybody on this chip everyone
I met was so cool it's literally
everything when you get a good group of
people that like vibe well together so
that was so much fun and I'm so so so so
grateful for YouTube and I'm so grateful
for you guys and yeah it's honestly it's
so weird but like making videos in my
bedroom and talking to you guys is like
one of the only places I feel like I
belong and then I come to events and
stuff and it's just a whole nother level
and it's like I feel I don't know if
it's my social anxiety I don't know if
it's my just maybe I need to work on my
self-confidence in terms of like putting
myself out there when I meet people that
do similar things like I don't know what
it is but it's just like you feel like
you're like a puzzle piece that just
doesn't belong to any sort of puzzle
you're just like a piece floating around
trying to figure out where the hell you
fit I get that I feel that even though
it might seem like I'm super sure of
myself and I'm super confident and
self-aware I still feel so unsure of
where I fit in on this earth I was like
super deep that we just got on a really
really deep level there so game plan is
brew myself the best bubble bath and
then I'm gonna take a nap and then I'm
gonna head to the airport and work on
dreamcatcher I could buy a Vegas
time to go home
I don't want to be talking on the phone
every night 6 p.m. with times on yours
or my income over where you are who you
with an intense it is 1044 in the
morning weird thing for blondes with me
is that I always feel like I want there
to be some sort of take away from my
video I mean we did talk about being
aliens in Vegas so that's kind of
something thank you guys for venturing
on this Vegas trip with me this was such
a last-minute thing and I've been
feeling all types of funky lately so I
wasn't sure how I felt about going but
I'm really really glad I did everything
in life is happening for you not to you
and you're learning up from everything
so no matter what no matter what kind of
feeling you're having to that kind of it
day you're having like you're always
growing so that's the way you just got
to look at everything in life and I'm
gonna stop trying to be dr. Phil right
now because I'm Way too tired
I'm Way too tired to be giving any sort
of life advice I love you guys to the
moon and back I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and wish me all great slumber
because holy smokes I've been up for far
far too long but you Tomer starts on
Saturday oh boy this kind of telling you
to sleep
you don't know it but you won't come
back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
