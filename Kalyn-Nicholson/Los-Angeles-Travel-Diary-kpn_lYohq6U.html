so it is Tuesday December 5th it's 7:30
in the morning because Toronto is like
actually 10:30 in the morning
we actually got to LA yesterday we hit
the flight made it here grabbed a like a
really quick bite to eat okay so I tried
blogging last night I've been spending
enough time couple lemon balm aside I'll
go to sitting on the mind spin on red
wine I've been sitting never
is ripping out the pages how do I get so
faded how do I get so faded yeah looks
like we are in a dorm okay I think so
this is how I feel the chemicals bank
but stream don't be alarmed yeah we do I
turn it off we are officially in LA I
told you guys my last video yes I
started that I put it in i was like you
wrote it but you I wrote it okay I did
Shirley's a brother but she didn't say
anything and I was catching it cuz I was
like oh now we're gonna head to Beverly
Hills we're gonna go crop some sushi I
think we're gonna go out for a drink or
two this is cat's first time in LA so
whole reason we're here is to go to
refinery29 they're opening like this
event so we're going there on Wednesday
night but until then we just get to like
pretty much to do do whatever we want
we're gonna go grab sushi we're gonna go
grab drinks
we got like mad Heike almost like not
even hi he got interrogated pretty hard
love the line yeah they were like they
were convinced that we were coming for
unauthorized reasons and cat was like
the guy was like if you ever been
arrested I was like no and he looks at
cat he goes of you she goes in the US
and I look at her like who are you I'm
surprised you didn't say like oh yeah
when I was like no he's like are you
sure and he had me questioning if I had
ever been arrested use no no no
you're like I shouldn't have to do I'm
not testing 3/7 they know they know I
did it I literally thought he wasn't
gonna let us do but we're here we made
us all right let's rally let's do this
we were like yeah like let's get ready
let's go out we got ready for so long
let's go for sushi it's sugar fish and
the Pat is like allergic to the world
and I'm vegan so we go to the sugar fish
place and we're like we get cucumber
rolls and we get a cucumber roll one
without sesame seeds and then um tempura
and they're like we don't make those we
just make cucumber so we were like be
glad we got the cucumber rolls and they
were really good and I'm going to target
because we were freezing it was actually
so cold last night and we bought sup
pants and begi shirts we got stranger
things shirts and then the sweatpants I
got guys are friggin Hogwarts let me
just it's really cute
so our first night in LA we literally
went to Target and our room is haunted
but it's basically a really really old
hotel room but they redid in 2014 but
Kat like the minute we walked in and cat
was like this is haunted he kept it in
like they kept the character of it and
so there's these windows and last night
cuts like oh my god there's a handprint
it was like actually there's two
handprints and they're clean tampering
oh okay bring it all we had talked about
in my sister's room when I was a child
it would sum up with the trip so far is
we attempted to get food we went to
Target and our place is haunted
yeah the highlight is definitely the
sweatpants Hogwarts sweatpants you can't
go wrong I think this morning we're
gonna head to Beverly Hills and maybe it
go shopping grab some breakfast come
back at ready and then go to Santa
Monica that's kind of the plan I just
grabbed a nice toe you guys are curious
I've been getting like a grande me so
with the Christmas blend and coconut
milk and then I've been adding the
chestnut praline syrup because it's so
friggin good let's get to it I guess
what kind of tastes like actually
like can we just for a moment we made
some good purchases and we went shopping
we went to the Grove and then we just
put the Urban Outfitters home to which I
spent more money than I probably should
have but this sweater is a great find
we're gonna try and get ready as fast as
possible and then basically head to
Santa Monica also we want to take
another attempt at sushi that's
currently the plan also way too hot in
here for this sweater so I'm gonna strip
this off and get ready
there's not much we can do today
unfortunately or during all these fires
around la basically we're trying to stay
off the roads today so we might not be
able to do as much exploring of LA as we
saw it which is totally fine because
obviously like we care more about yeah
these are people's homes and stuff so we
just want to stay off the roads to keep
them clear we're in like the downtown LA
area so I think we're gonna stay around
here for the day
well actually we didn't just wake up but
we've just been chilling all morning in
our hotel and we're freakin hungry do
some shopping hang out on the patio and
then we have the event tonight long to
look nothing this morning cuz we
literally just laid in bed and watch
news watch the news fell back asleep
walked to Starbucks just hoping that
everybody who's affected by these fires
and like all the people all the animals
all their houses like are okay we're
just gonna do our best to explore as
much of downtown LA as we can
considering these our last day here
to where I'm lost
lighters do that
in about the place on
Parkman
somehow get the feeling I'm done
but I
I'll become
I'll be a try
driving auntie
30,000 miles party man has fallen quiet
aside we're now heading back to the
airport last day was super fun
I'm actually really segmented a started
coming out with a cool addition at this
lighting is no is I can't get this to
like nod have this nice I started coming
out with a cold last night anyway so
this is like an extra hot me snow for my
throat we're about to hit the airport
the caption like the overall synopsis of
this trip is we we tried it's a fun
little getaway tell a got to see Santa
Monica
it's like explore a little bit but
thousand versus party man who hasn't
fallen quasi I am finally oh can I just
start by saying how good it feels to be
back in Toronto the event last night
that we went to was the twenty nine
rooms held by refinery29 and that was so
cool like all of us the clips you guys
saw were amazing but what you didn't see
we were chilling like side by side with
Cody Simpson and playing it so cool but
like when I say playing it cool we were
like to each other not playing cool but
in general we were like this is normal
now that I'm home I'm actually going to
unpack I'm going to get a few work
things done I just ordered ubereats
because I have no groceries solely
because I'm also leaving tomorrow to go
to Kingston so I knew I wouldn't be here
