you know just Drake's girlfriend working
out getting ready for drinks guys so for
today's video I am doing another current
obsessions I haven't done one of these I
think since February so it has been a
little while since I've shared with you
guys all of the things I am obsessed
with because we all know that I tend to
obsess over a lot of things some of them
further adieu I'm not gonna do much of
an intro because I have quite a few
things to show you guys that I'm
obsessing over so let's jump in I've
been using this for a while but I've
recently come to terms with just like
how much I love it I'm like I just it's
so crucial it's so convenient and that
is my water bottle so a lot of you guys
will have seen it in vlogs or like
fitness videos and I just leaked all
over myself I always get asked the
question of where it's from and all that
stuff so it is from the Blogilates
website I will leave a link if I can
find it down below on the back the cool
thing about it is it has like time slots
so like you're supposed to drink this
much by 8 9 10 11 12 and then they
refill it do it again
I don't follow the time slots on the
back because I tend to drink like four
or five of these a day yeah so that's
the water bottle I've been obsessing
with and the really cool thing about it
too is if you can see inside it has one
of these like like infusers so it comes
off and I fill it with lemon but you can
also put like cucumbers mint
strawberries you could put whatever you
want in there I'm literally addicted to
this thing this is like my sidekick I
never leave it so that is my water
bottle and I keep on dripping on myself
with the help so that another thing I
have been really obsessed with are the
Sally Hansen complete salon manicure
nail polishes so someone recently told
me I think it was on my pampered day
routine video that these are cruelty
free so correct me if I'm wrong but
after somebody told me that I went and
bought a bunch of them so I picked up
these are my two favorite colors right
now and I think they're adorable for
like transitioning from spring to summer
so this one is sky's the limit and
watching my videos and you've been
noticing that I wearing like a bright
blue and you wanted to know what color
it is its sky's the limit by Sally
Hansen and the other one I'm really
obsessed with is called happy days and
it's like a purpley pink so the book the
crown recently came out and it is the
last book in the selection series I've
talked about the selection series before
she came out with like a spinoff series
that kind of still fits in I don't want
to
anything but this was the last book in
the series I picked it up I read it in
two days I'm putting it in this video
because I was obsessed with reading it
I'm a little indifferent towards the
storyline in terms of I just thought
that the first storyline of the first
three books was so like rich and there
was so much craziness going on and this
one I found was a little bit slower but
I still did really really liked it and I
had to know what was going to happen and
I read it in two days like I didn't put
it down so I was definitely obsessed
with this which speaking of being
obsessed with like characters and all of
that fun stuff I actually caught all the
way up in Vampire Diaries recently and
I've been addicted to it but let me just
say if you've caught all the way up
again I'm not going to ruin it if you
haven't but if you caught all the way up
can we just take a second to talk about
Enzo Enzo and Vampire Diaries is
officially my dream guy and it's so
funny because it was nothing that's just
like so not my type but now that's my
type I have changed my type to being bad
boys and fake leather jackets with
accents and holy crap Enzo is way too
hot to be on this earth why can't why
can't until the vampire be a real real
thing cuz I would hunt him down you know
not like vampire hunt him down but like
hunt him down like to marry me and the
next step session of mine which I'm sure
you guys won't be surprised because
again it has taken lots of time up in
vlogs and videos and such and it is my
slippers so I keep getting asked where
these guys are from I got them over the
Christmas time from Victoria's Secret
they came for free was like a pair of
pajamas but I'm sure you could probably
still find them but these are literally
the best slippers I have ever owned in
my entire life apartment is hardwood so
I like walking around in slippers just
because I don't know it's just cozy and
comfy these make you feel like you're
walking on clouds and not only that I
like that the bottom of them is like
like a tougher material there are a lot
more sturdy and durable so I can use
these when I take the garbage to the
garbage room and all of that fun stuff
but I never I'm like never not wearing
these when I'm in my apartment and as
you guys may have known or noticed I got
ever since I moved into this apartment I
got like really back into working out
daily and like eating really healthy and
all that stuff and so I rewarded myself
with a little bit of like a workout
clothing shopping spree and two things
I'm going to show you guys that I got
from Victoria's Secret so the very first
one is this tank top here and it's my
favorite tank tops
it's just like a standard muscle top in
the front or muscle shirt but the back
is really really cute it's got like a
slit two slits right here and then it's
got this like thing going down the
middle that says vsx and the other top
that I got it is in the fitness section
but I kind of weird a little bit more
for like loungewear or if I'm doing like
yoga in the morning and it is just this
like black top I've worn it I would put
video today where I wore it in my break
up like how to get over a breakup video
but this is what it looks like and it's
super cute in the back it is like
twisted and then open back at the top
and like loose and cut at the bottom and
then the other really cute thing about
it too is when you're wearing the
sleeves it's got like the little thumb
holes every time those two shirts come
out of the wash they're like the first
two things I tend to wear and in terms
of some beauty products one color that
I'm really really obsessive lately in
terms of lipstick is the NYX in what
color is this Talia I think that's how
you say it
but it's color five to nine it's super
cute I'm wearing it on my lips right now
and I just really really like it I like
the like how creamy it is and such and
then I normally pair it with the
Smashbox instument insta matte on top
this has been like my best friend for
the last month I'm not kidding you any
lipstick I wear I put this on top and I
don't know if many of you guys are
country listeners at all but Dierks
Bentley came out with four new songs it
is like it's like a teaser for his album
that's coming out which I am counting
down the days because I am obsessed with
Dierks Bentley fun fact that you guys
may have not have known is that Bentley
like doggie Bentley like little pup pup
he's not named after Bentley like the
vehicle he's named after Bentley like
Dierks Bentley so I don't think I've
ever told you guys that before how I
came up with Bentley's name absolutely
love Dierks Bentley he's my favorite
country artist and he released four new
songs three of them um addicted to I'll
be the moon pickup and black he did like
really cool music videos for all of them
too so if you guys like country and you
didn't know that he released some new
songs go check them out because I'm
actually addicted and for all my foodies
and all my vegans I have something
really cool to show you guys that I've
recently been addicted to and it is the
guard Guardian guardian I don't know how
to say the brand but I think it's like
Guardian Guardian garden I don't know
anyways they are meatless
jokes they do come with teriyaki sauce I
don't use them but these have been my
latest addiction I will make fried rice
like teriyaki fried rice with like my
own teriyaki sauce I will stir fry up a
bunch of vegetables and these little
chicken strips and put them in and then
I'll put like mustard on top I know it
sounds weird I put mustard on absolutely
everything so yeah I eat it with like
teriyaki and mustard and a little bit of
coriander on top and holy Lord this is
so flippin good and they're so easy to
come in like the frozen section I
believe you can get them at Walmart but
they are a little bit high in sodium I
don't do it every single night but a
whole my gosh these are so flippin good
so if you guys are vegan or even if
you're not these are really good healthy
alternative to like chicken strips so go
check these out they are so freakin good
and I'm obsessed and you know what now
that we're talking about this I think
I'm gonna make myself some rice and the
last thing I have to show you guys is I
would say I've been back into running
now for three months so I decided that I
was going to invest in a good set of
headphones because for me anyways music
can make or freakin break a workout so I
went to Best Buy and I walked in and I
was like dude to the guy I was like I
need something that's gonna like blast
the bass in my ears like I need the base
of the song to be super loud probably
why I am so deaf like I don't I kid you
not guys I have the worst hearing ever I
ended up like you know treating myself a
little bit and I picked up some beats oh
my god these are like on freaking real I
can't even explain to you I'm silver I
don't remember what the color actually
is but they were one of the limited
edition these are really really
expensive I'm not gonna lie
these were worth every single penny for
me the bass in them is so loud and I
love that they're Wireless so I can hook
it up to my Bluetooth and I don't have
the freaking wire like you know what
it's just so convenient when I'm running
but these have even been nice too in
terms of going to like Starbucks and
working on dreamcatcher I will pop these
in and it's like the whole world just
drowns out and the bass in them is so
loud and it's just it's literally made
these are half the reason why I'm so
addicted to working out right now it
makes me just feel so badass when I'm
working out and I tend to listen to like
R&amp;amp;B usually and the bass is loud and I
just I feel like I'm like drinks

sessions those are all of the things
