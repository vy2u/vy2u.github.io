to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A with you guys I
recently posted a photo to Instagram so
I'm going to try and get to as many of
the questions as I possibly can but if I
missed your question
fret not I think I'm going to be doing a
lot more Q&amp;amp;A s more frequently so if you
guys aren't following me already I will
leave the little links right here so you
guys can go ahead and follow me and ask
your questions and other than that let's
jump in to the questions so punctured
winged dot s says I love you and do you
have a celebrity crush and then in
brackets not drake LOL so i'm not
allowed to save drake for this one I had
to choose a celebrity crush it would
probably be um if I had to pick one I'd
say probably the desert because not only
is he a smoke show but he's also vegan
which is just super hot you know
Colette walk up Colette wassailing sorry
my butcher your guy's name asks when did
you have your first kiss if we're
talking just like a like a little peck
um I believe it was in junior
kindergarten but if we're talking like
an actual like kiss kiss like my real
first kiss it was summer going into high
school it was with again my crush from
like grade 6 7 8 type thing and it was
that one of those like really dorky like
teen dances I knew I had to leave I was
always that kid that got picked up way
earlier than everybody else so I
literally grabbed his face kissed him
and then ran out and that was my first
kiss lo-har co-op says I love your
tattoos are you thinking of getting any
more and if so where what extent I think
for right now at the moment I'm kind of
done with tattoos for a little while I
always like have that little bit of an
adrenaline rush or that impulse to kind
of just run out and grab another one do
you think I would want maybe one more in
my life I just don't think I'll be
getting it anytime soon Sophie prx says
would you like to have a children one
day I definitely want to have kids one
day I think I would want kids by the
time I'm like 30 so I still have about
eight years to figure that out I mean
first I'd probably have to get a husband
and then before that I'd probably have
to get a boyfriend that is like way far
off into the future mousse 7 3 8 says
how do you feel about how you've grown
as a person in the last year to be a
hundred percent honest with you I don't
think I've ever grown so
much as a person that I have in the last
year moving and coming out of
relationships and meeting new people and
just so many things have gone into I
think who I am today and I think I'm
still kind of growing and learning even
just in the past I would say three or
four months I think I've grown a lot
more it has been so like we're freshing
for me to see that or feel that in
myself because I'm someone I am very
very very hard on myself starting to
really become more comfortable with who
I am and and in my own skin and the
things that I enjoy and kind of more
sure of myself and more confident in
those things so Erica Luna 19 asks what
slash who is your biggest motivation I
think what is my biggest motivation is
and this is going to sound so cliche my
biggest motivation is truly an honestly
it's just happiness and that sounds so
like corny cliche whatever but honestly
I have come to realize the things that
do make me very very happy in life and I
have spent a great portion of my life
feeling very anxious and I battled with
depression before and so I know what I
have felt like at my lowest low when I
started to change the way I saw like the
game in terms of life I think I stopped
feeling like there was a certain way I
had to be or I had to live and started
realizing that I can adopt all these
things to my own self in my own life and
then when I kind of made that connection
started to feel like what it meant to be
genuinely happy I think the other
biggest motivator for me is power and I
don't mean power in the sense of money I
love the feeling of being in power of my
life I may not be able to control what
goes on on the outside but I have full
control over the way I act in the way I
react and the things I do in the things
I say how much hard work I wanted to put
into things or how healthy I wanted to
be when I started to kind of take
control over these things
I felt so like in control and so badass
that makes any sense and that feeling is
like it is so addicting to me at least
over the last 4 months that has been my
biggest motivator so Morgan Lynn Lynn
asks where would you like to see
yourself in 10 years I love you so much
so I think in 10 years I would a want to
be
be successful obviously not necessarily
money but definitely happiness and
getting fulfillment and joy out of what
I do for a living I think I would want
to be married some you know hot husband
probably have a kid or maybe two like 32
I will still be doing YouTube let's
throw that one on there too but I think
I also want to create something on the
side and I still haven't really been
able to fully establish what that is yet
and hopefully by that I will know and I
will have made it so t18 3 asks do you
prefer living on your own or with a
friend I don't know which one I prefer
they both have so many awesome pros and
cons obviously I miss living with Maggie
to death it is so sad coming home and
not having just like my you know my
roomie just chillin and like we would
have a glass of wine or we would drink
coffee every morning and just like chat
up about life or it was like an ultimate
girls night every single night I loved
that I loved living with my best friend
but at the same time I am somebody that
when I first moved away to college I
loved living on my own and I didn't
really know anyone in the town that I
had moved to and so I kind of have a
little bit more of a taste of that in
terms of living on my own now that I am
somebody that I do quite enjoy my alone
time a and B I find that I am a lot more
productive I think because I mean I'm
here by myself all the time so unless I
want to just lay around on the couch all
night I find I am extremely more
productive in terms of like filming
videos and editing and working on my
book and things like that but I miss
living with mags today breanne ray v
asks can you play any instruments I play
the guitar every few days I'll pick up
my guitar and just kind of jam out for a
little bit so ears Stella
asks what is your favorite way of
pampering yourself after a long day love
you I think after a really really long
day my favorite way of pampering is I'll
usually take like a super hot shower and
then I put on like a nice facemask
bundling up into some really comfy
clothes on my slippers and then like
grabbing Bentley jumping on the couch
and just honestly vegging out and no
matter what kind of day I'm having that
is like the ultimate way for me to end
the day normally I also like to do this
like without my phone there's something
about just like disconnecting from the
world being like ha ha ha
you can get to me right now no one's
gonna stop me from watching One Tree
Hill Serena
underscore Vol'jin ah've asks do you
have a middle name and I do my middle
name is Maurice K W Lane asks are you
talking to anyone or are you staying
single so at the moment I am NOT talking
to anyone I'm kind of indifferent into
terms of staying single I'm going to
face of my life right now where I'm not
really looking to jump into anything
with anyone I'm not fully sure what I
bring to the table in terms of a
relationship and that's something that I
really want to find out before I would
be jumping into another one Drake if
you're watching this or Liam now that
we've covered that I'm single
hit me up slide into my DMS you know so
Julie Tom asks what is the biggest
turnoff when it comes to boys so I think
for me the biggest turnoff when it comes
to guys there are like two things that
are just like huge like no nose for me
one of them is organs I don't like guys
that are very arrogant I don't like
going out with a guy and him being like
super rude to the waiter or just being
kind of like arrogant in general
anything like that like any sort of sign
of arrogance and I'm gone and the second
one is guys that just pretend they don't
care or like guys that are like oh if I
put an effort it's going to seem like I
want her too much any guy that likes to
play games like that like don't get me
wrong the game can be fun but effort is
attractive to me those would be the two
biggest things like arrogance and just
pretending to not give a so that is
all of the questions that I am going to
be answering today I hope you guys
enjoyed this Q&amp;amp;A keep in mind that if I
didn't answer your question that I will
be doing a ton more of q and A's on both
my Instagram on my twitter so be sure to
go follow me on there so that you guys
won't miss out on the next so I love you
guys to the moon and back and I will see
all of you guys in my next video bye
