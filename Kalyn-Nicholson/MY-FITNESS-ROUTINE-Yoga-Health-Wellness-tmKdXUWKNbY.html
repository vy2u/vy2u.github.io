today's video I'm doing a fitness
related video it's been one that's been
requested so long I figured with it
being spring and leading into summer I
would give you guys a bit of a peek into
my recent fitness routine as well as
answer a lot of your guys's questions
that I've been getting an elbow Yoga
about being vegan about what I eat about
my workouts all of that stuff so we're
gonna be going over all of those things
in today's video first things first I
kind of started out this video with the
intention of filming a bit more of like
a week of my life
fitness routine the only thing is this
week ended up being a lot crazier than I
anticipated so a lot of the workouts
either got cut or they were really short
and they just weren't my best and not to
mention I am currently trying to build
the cartilage back up in my knee I
damaged my need pretty bad I tried
giving it two weeks off of working out
and then this week was my first week
back and I got like three full really
good workouts in before it kind of went
out again it's also stressful because I
was like my video what about my
video we're gonna discuss all the things
I'm gonna show you all the all the
things I've been eating lately like a
what I eat in the day exercises I've
been doing and answering all your
Fitness related questions so let's start
with the good stuff shall we ask for
food lately especially this week but
just in general I have been so drawn to
eating Whole Foods there's this
documentary I watched when I was going
to Hawaii back in January called in
defense of food and even though it isn't
a vegan documentary there was still a
lot that I took away from it in terms of
just like packaged food versus plant
food and food that comes from our earth
versus food that comes from a factory
and then throwing on top of their eating
into like plants and getting into yoga
and getting into meditation and feel
like I started to notice the foods I was
eating more rather than being more
mindless about it and so lately I've
just been drawn to eat
when you like just plants like anything
that came from the earth I'm like yes
allow me to give you some examples one
of my last favorites has been basically
adding all of like tropical tasting
fruits I guess with a banana and vanilla
almond con that literally type shape
I've also been really obsessed with
fresh pressed juices lately so I've been
buying them from the grocery store but I
have a juicer at my dad's house that I
want to pick up I think it back into
juicing again I feel like they're good
substitutes for multiple coffees
throughout the day there's such as a
quick burst of energy and they taste
like they taste so good especially we
get like fresh press pineapple oh yeah
and I'm going to throw a bit of carrot
in there too because it's Easter weekend
so let's talk about this smoothie mango
can then finish it off with just a
little bit of almond milk and then
there's one secret ingredient that I
swear to god that makes a world
they were moving at a comfortable pace
said if you wanna run yeah you do
but I feel like we in the same place are
we doing it right are we doing it right
you know everyone has
two sets everyone has different
ideal what they think is right but I'll
be doing it right are we doing it right
we
kind of like Buddha bowls they're kind
of like salad bowls - you know stews
have been making soups where I'll put
like tofu and veggies and rice noodles
in them and I would have been making
smoothies and I want to start making
juices lately I've been craving just
Whole Foods and then throwing a protein
in there with like tofu or like vegan
skewers or whatever it is even sometimes
portobello mushroom caps I feel like
kind of gets that that salty flavor that
I'm sometimes hankering but I've also
been trying to intake my water which has
been a bit more of a struggle than I
thought I have this little yoga water
bottle that I've been drinking out of a
lot more I think I've maybe done for a
day once this week the intention is
there you know moving along the second
portion to health and fitness is
obviously you know the fitness I've
still been doing up my daily yoga it's
something that I still have
these
so each day in this video I'm gonna
basically highlight like a different
part of my fitness routine in order to
kind of give you guys more dialogue and
so right now it's still relatively
pretty early in the morning I just got
back in from walking Bentley through my
hair and some braids and pulled up my
yoga mat even if I can only get like 5
minutes of stretching in even if I don't
have a yoga mat with me I will literally
just stretch for like 5 minutes in
whatever bed I woke up in something that
I've created as a habit this year and
it's within a few weeks I was already so
much more flexible because it was
something I was doing every day I've
become addicted to yoga because of how
good it makes me feel it helps me more
than any sort of like medications are
ever taken for my anxiety it helps me
more than any sort of breathing
techniques or any sort of like mind
tricks that I used to try and do not to
mention especially doing yoga in the
morning I find that my energy throughout
the rest of the day is a lot like higher
and I'm just in a better mood I will
usually followup yoga with some
meditation and it just like I get to set
the intention for my day or even just
like the energy I'm carrying over from
yesterday it's just such an easy way to
just melt that all away my Energy's
higher I'm more mindful during the day
at my anxieties lower less adjust it
feels so damn good after waking up when
you're like muscles are all stiff and
tense
that's why I think no matter where my
fitness regimen is that like when I'm
traveling I'm not going to make it such
a big thing to have to workout every day
but I will make it a big thing to just
get up and do a bit of yoga everyday
because it's so versatile it's so easy
to do no matter where you are that said
I'm gonna do my Tuesday my Tuesday yoga
and touch back with you guys I don't
know what eventually soon
see your stars are shinin just fine
Sadie of stars there's so much that I
can't see who knows I felt it from the
first ever exception that
our dreams day truth
see stars just whomping everybody
the rest it's so therapeutic to me and
it's so it's so cool to feel your body
kind of learn to do things or open up
and stretch in ways that you weren't
able to do before even just getting into
learning more advanced you know poses
like where I'm holding my body up in
certain ways I can feel my core getting
stronger and I can feel my arms and like
my shoulders getting stronger it's super
addictive aigis I decided that I want to
get my splits so I'm just like aching to
know how how much closer I'll be in like
three months and four months and it's
not a fast result which i think is
actually really good for me on something
that I'm really into that doesn't give
me my results right away because I have
to work at it and I think that that's
kind of building up that part inside of
me working on putting in the work on a
day to day basis or something that'll
build over time I tried to get back into
running this week this is my first week
back I took over two weeks a break
see they of stones Oh
biggest thing that I'm noticing this
week since it is my first week back into
like running and working out yoga is
super easy for me because I've been
doing it consistently but because I took
such a break to give my knee some time
to heal the struggle to actually get
myself to work out is so by day three
and four it starts to feel really good
again and even though before today's
workout I again had that feeling where I
was just like no I don't want to if
you're watching this and you're feeling
that like struggle to just actually want
to physically workout just push through
I swear by day three the end of day
three which is the day I'm on right now
but feel the shift it will happen first
run was not bad like I actually did
pretty well and I only ran four cakes I
need to build the cartilage back up by
day two I was feeling it a little bit
though so I just went on the bike and
then by day three but on the elliptical
did some strength training felt totally
fine until I woke up yesterday my knee
is definitely hurting now that I've gone
three days in a row I woke up today and
it was really sore so I was like you
know what feel just go biking but now
it's 8:30 and it's raining and I think
I'm just gonna have to accept defeat
today I was walking Bentley yesterday
morning and limping that's how bad it
was so I've decided to take yesterday
and today is a bit more of a break but
still incorporating my yoga because I
find that that helps I'm gonna take the
break listen to my body and just like
continue to do yoga as my main stream of
fitness so between that and getting back
into a proper sleep schedule this week
the difference that I feel from when I
started out this week to today being
Friday it's substantial so I posted to
Twitter asking you guys yoga food
Fitness vegan health workout or wellness
related questions for my video and so
I'm just going to go through and answer
some of the top ones now that Sandra
wants to know what's one workout you've
always wanted to try I've been kind of
wanting to try boxing lately I want to
find like a kickboxing class or a boxing
class I don't know maybe like some sort
of martial arts go to town you know it
might be something I have to try out or
look for when I get back from my trips
either that or dancing house and it
could be really cool to go to like a
dance class and just pop lock and drop
it
Alan says I want to try yoga so bad but
I've got zero flexibility what do you
suggest I actually am NOT or I guess I
I've become more flexible now that I've
been doing yoga but I wasn't a generally
flexible person before either there were
a few things I could do just because of
doing gymnastics as a kid and doing
cheerleading in high school but I mean
when I started doing yoga I couldn't
touch my toes even if you have zero
flexibility I would say you just start
you just start with whatever feels good
don't like think you have to do a
specific sort of like coordination start
you just got you got to start somewhere
Andrea wants to know will you do a video
on how to begin doing yoga your tips and
tricks I can definitely do a full video
on this I kind of touched on this before
but I still feel like I'm in the
beginner stages I feel like making a
video is putting that stamp of approval
that I think I am qualified to tell
other people how to do it and I'm still
learning for myself how to do it with my
own body that said my main goal are like
one of my bigger goals with yoga's to
eventually get to a point where I could
make yoga instruction videos or I could
do you know more yoga related content
and so I'm just kind of slowly letting
it happen naturally as I learn you can
definitely expect videos in the future
all about yoga like you're gonna get so
your mates sick of seeing yoga on this
channel I feel premonition I'm having
respawns know what's the best way to
stick to a healthy routine make it
habitual make it things that you don't
even have to think about they're just
things that you love to do and having an
intention with everything you do because
I feel like when we are more mindless in
our day-to-day living we kind of lose
touch with why we are doing the things
that we do and so if you want to stick
to a health routine or you want to stick
to a fitness routine or if you just want
to even add just a little bit more like
drinking a bit more water going to bed a
bit earlier I think if you set an
intention as to why you even want to do
it in the first place
but I kicks you into high gear to take
it a bit more seriously and actually
follow through I find by like the end of
the third day of sticking to whatever it
is you're trying to learn but they for
and take five it's starting to flow a
little bit more naturally and then by
like day eight and nine you're just
completely hooked Lydia would like to
know how has working out / eating well
effective your mental health especially
in terms of yoga I think that it has
substantially increased my ability to
understand my mental health and
understand the types of pathways that my
brain likes to take in given situations
but it's also created this
face in my life where I can kind of do
things that make me feel good internally
and make me feel better or make me feel
more awake or make me feel more
energetic and doing that those little
things and then noticing those kind of
rewards after doing those things it's
created a sense of happiness within
myself that I feel like it's so simple
but it's so needed I've always kind of
been into eating a bit healthier and
working out I guess but I've never taken
it as seriously as I have this year a
difference in even just how confident I
feel in myself the things I have control
of my life over and the things I don't
just so many little things like that
come from something as simple as just
eating a bit healthier and stretching
every morning and night it will create
kind of a synergy within your body at
your mind and your soul you're getting
real deep but it creates this sort of
synergy between those three aspects of
who you are I feel like those three
things have to be in balance for you to
feel in balance so you can't just work
on your mind you can't just work on your
soul you can't just work on your body
you have to have a balance going on and
a give-and-take from all three of those
things we're gonna kind of increase your
state of mind on a day to day basis
Kerrigan wants to know what is your
favorite vegan dessert and I would have
to say ice cream ice cream your cookies
but there's something about a good tub
of Ben and Jerry's non-dairy peanut
butter and cookie dough oh my god Emma
wants to know where do you get your
inspiration for your yoga flows yourself
question mark YouTube question mark I
got my inspiration for my yoga flows and
say obviously from music I put on some
music that kind of just takes my mind
off of whatever I'm thinking about and
just helps me tune into how my body
feels you're moving one way and all of a
sudden you're like you know what would
really feel good following this up is to
like move this way and then like all of
a sudden your legs up in the air and the
next thing you know you're downward dogs
it just starts to kind of happen
naturally that's that I learned a lot of
my yoga poses from going to hot yoga
classes and also I follow a lot of like
yoga Instagram channel but most of the
time I find it's just easier to kind of
throw on some tunes and just let my body
kind of guide me Kim wants to know do
you miss eating beef pork or chicken I
love you I actually I don't miss it at
all that said
I still like to eat veggie burgers I
still like to eat veggie chicken skewers
and things like that tiara wants to know
how do you stay motivated to keep going
when you workout into yoga I start and
then I lose my motivation to keep going
I think kind of like earlier it's all
about setting an intention but I think
it's also about finding a workout or
fitness routine or a health routine that
works for you it might be that you
haven't found a routine or a schedule
that kind of suits you or suits your
personality type or suits the things
that you're interested in for instance
you could make your daily workout
routine going for like a long walk with
your dog through nature and it could
just be something so simple like that
but something that gets your body moving
on a daily basis and something that you
wake up looking forward to something
that it kind of pulls you away from the
world and gives you a little bit of you
time every now and then it doesn't have
to be yoga it doesn't have to be
strength training it doesn't have to be
running it could be honestly anything
that gets you moving anything that moves
your body getting a bike and biking all
over the places that you need to go
especially now that the weather is
getting nice there's so many different
ways that you can incorporate a
healthier lifestyle without feeling like
that dread of oh god I need to go to the
gym now like you don't have to you just
have to find something that makes you
happy it makes you feel like you're
taking care of yourself and in tune with
your body you know so Barbie doll also
how do you balance trying to be a
healthy when you have a hectic schedule
/ light so I feel like this is a good
question and on because this has been
like my week this week got completely
out of hand for me this video was
supposed to be more of like a week in my
life like I mentioned and it turned into
this because honestly like God ahead of
me things became hectic my schedule just
got way too swamped my knee threw out
again and life happens and I think that
the way that you find balance is almost
kind of accepting that like try and do
the best you can and work with what
you've got rather than having an
expectation of what you want it becomes
a lot easier to enjoy getting fit and
getting healthier and taking care of
your body and you almost become like an
experiment to yourself rather than a
judgment against yourself you almost
want to go into it with the mindset of
you know this is where I'm at right now
but I wonder if I could make myself feel
better I wonder if I can have more
energy
if my body could become more toned or
more strong or I'd be able to move my
body in a certain way I never used to or
I'd be able to sleep longer or be more
alert or get more done in a day or feel
like I'm in a better mood or feel like
the energy and myself has shifted in
some way based on the way I'm taking
care of myself you become your own
experiment in wellness and it becomes so
addicting when you go at it from that
mindset that when things do get hectic
it still somehow finds a way to slip
itself into your schedule because at the
end of the day if you don't take care of
yourself you're not going to have as
much of yourself to give to those other
parts of your life instead of kind of
creating this stress around trying to be
healthier or more fit you just accept
that you're busy do the best you can
with what you've got and find a way to
slip as much you know intention and
action in your day as you can without
overwhelming yourself and that is my dr.
