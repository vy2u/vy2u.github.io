everyone so it is Sunday July 31st it is
the last day of month and it's a Sunday
and I don't know what it is about it
being like the last day of a month on a
Sunday but I just feel like it's the
perfect way to wrap up all of July
so obviously July was like a crazy crazy
month for me I did a lot of traveling
this month between going to California I
also went on a family trips PEI and then
even up until Friday I was actually in
Toronto I got to go to a Wiz khlifa
slash Snoop Dogg concert and I actually
got to meet Wiz Khalifa which was like
the coolest thing ever
like a spy the water hits me been an
extra call to shake the words remember
this
who's who
especially time to make ourselves odd
stay tuned for an assault
this pendulum so yeah basically all in
all July has been a crazy month for me
as summer has been insane but I'm
definitely kind of catching one of those
moods where I feel like I want to get
back into a bit of a routine I do have
another trip coming up in the month of
August that I will be telling you guys
about soon it's going to be in my life
Monday episode but it also has to do
with dreamcatcher which is really cold
between now and then I feel like I kind
of want to lay low a little bit get back
into a routine and just start you know
like kind of getting everything back
together back in order if that makes any
sense as much as I like you know living
in like living off of impulse and doing
like really cool opportunities and crazy
things all the time definitely have like
so many things and so many ideas that I
want to get done and I find that like
the constant come and go of this month
is kind of you know postponed a lot of
the things that I could have had done by
now getting back into like a good health
and fitness routine and just back into a
good work routine and all of that fun
stuff and so I thought that today would
be the perfect day to start that solely
for the fact that it is Sunday and it's
the last day of July so what better like
way to kind of wind down also also can
we just talk about the fact that we hit
1 million subscribers I haven't been
able to even talk about that in a video
yet that actually happens to me while I
was in PT I - I hit a million
subscribers holy crap guys you have no
idea I freaked the eff out if you would
have told me like three years ago that I
was going to hit a million subscribers
one day I would have literally lost my
mind and I just loved like the community
that we've built on here and it's just
so insane and for that reason I have so
much coming for you guys you have no
idea there will be updates on dream
catcher soon there's so many like back
to fall back to school videos coming and
just all of this crazy stuff and I'm
just so pumped for it all today is
moreso just like getting my entire life
back on track so it started last night
with you know working on my
Genda and like my monthly schedule and
all of that type type of stuff but it's
going to continue into today in the
sense that like I really need to clean
up my fridge I need to go get groceries
I need to kind of make my workout and
fitness schedule which is a hint hint to
a future video when I was in Toronto I
it hit me I was just like I got this gut
feeling that I was like this is my next
move this is gonna be the next thing
that I want to do and something I'm
trying to kind of work on lately is
trusting my gut so what's trying to
figure out with where I wanted to move I
just I was kind of waiting for that gut
feeling to come so in 6 to 7 months I'll
probably be moving to Toronto that's
what was so cool about going there just
this weekend was you know kind of
getting a feel for it and it just kind
of sparks that inspiration in you and
let that motivation that's like okay now
that I know that that's my next step I'm
ready to start doing all of the steps
before that to get myself prepared to
get myself ready today is just one of
those days that I think I really want to
work on cleaning my slate and being
prepared and ready to start August like
fresh so it's like a huge huge update
for me and yeah I feel like I honestly
haven't sat down and told you guys like
much about my life and so long and so it
feels good to kind of like update you
all on where I'm at I know it's just
really nice for like the first time in a
long time to kind of feel like although
I had a great month of coming and going
and traveling and all of that stuff and
I'm not done it's just like I definitely
am in that mindset where I'm ready to
get back into a bit of a routine I think
that's why I kind of rearranged
everything I don't know if you guys even
noticed but I rearranged my entire
living room I'll put some cut Clips here
I did the video with you guys where I
redid my bedroom and I just feel like I
have a fresh new space and a fresh place
and I'm just ready to like get into the
work grind and like working out eating
healthy and yeah just kind of like
really enjoying the last month of summer
let me know down below where your guys's
heads are at what's going on in your
life are you guys traveling are you guys
trying to get back into a routine like
what's going on for you but I'm also
going to be doing a live stream because
I didn't get to do one for my 1 million
subscribers I was in PEI with terrible
Wi-Fi I'm going to be doing a live

video so watch out for that I will leave
