six help yes I am su maybe hey guys
what's up and welcome back to my channel
oh it is Saturday the 20 my bro is here
he's like hardcore creeping on you guys
in the back so yeah my little brother's
here he came up to visit me for the
weekend so we're going to go grab some
lunch we're going to do some shopping
I'm going to share with you guys what I
eat I spent a little bit more money than
I I was planning all hello are you doing
it's all good because I got really fun
things going to show them to that we
have a snack so I am so getting to jean
jackets because I couldn't decide on the
color I was like a plain blue one but
then I saw this dark then I saw this
dark grey one and I was like you know
what I feel like this is like it speaks
to me it's always wear all black so I
had to but then I was like but I still
needed an original one and of course I
bought both because I have a problem
like seven sides is too big just because
I wanted it to fit a specific way we
don't know why put this camera on my bed
it's like impossible for me to try and
show you everything right now yes I
wanted it to fit like super baggy and
then this is the other one I got I also
got this one I got this one eight sizes
too big and this one's really cool sooo
this is like super distressed so I got
this Guns N'Roses bodysuit
I actually kind of have like an outfit
in mind for Coachella with this and I
got a pair of leggings my $9.99 me or
did like H&amp;amp;M in forever 21 and all of
these places that are supposed to be
dirt cheap like suddenly raised all
those prices
um yeah like uh like ribbed detailing
along side so if those are the lanes and
I also went to ERISA only got two things
from here one it was just like a classic
bodysuit and I almost with a gray toned
white but it's just like a standard
bodysuit I have it in red and black as I
haven't seen me wear it before but it's
like so cute that I honestly would
probably just every time I go to the
mall I end up buying a color all the
time so it's fine it's good and then I
also picked up this rest from a risky up
at the brand is Wilford free salt and
pepper style and super like this the
material feels like it's going to be
like super comfy it's kind of like a
mini dress and just like tank tops tile
in the back it's got like an open slit
area plane rides traveling things like
that and then I also picked up some good
old Sanders flip-flops not have to go
downstairs and pick up my parcels from
the front desk in my slippers anymore
now I've got slip-on Bentley I love that
you've been creeping in this video this
whole time you're probably just gonna
laughs mad laughs for a little bit and
then we're going to go up for dinner
tonight we have no idea where we're
going
we'll figure that out when the time
comes all I know is I'm probably gonna
wear my new suit and trying to find all
red shoes for so long like Jake how long
ago did I tell you I wanted those all
red shoes so let's way before Christmas
Oh seven months ago we go in and I see
these shoes are in the kids section and
I was like that's them probably going to
wear them up for dinner tonight they
make me feel like I'm a lot blue and I
actually am
the New England Fox of all the legends
ever made Achille sands gold her killing
service gear spider-man the crazy water
so how much you worry I'm not have to
get somebody to consumer to some
superhero very intelligent
now Sunday and I'm actually taking my
brother to Corrine the place that was in
my most recent video P I saw a lot of
this woman vegetarianism so I really
wanted to show my brother this brunch
place so I'm taking him at there we're
gonna go get a bunch of food to see that
girl again from the cashier she was just
so warm and nice in good men performers
can I also get some vegan waffles on the
side you know you want to do now
aside from falling into a food coma you
want a burrito now a casual cool is this
- a bit got some drink going and we're
gonna go bring all this IKEA should and
no I need your pipe hello you know I am
pretty sure I might be able to do myself
no I think we look alike could be face
loss one time and it kind of was eerie
how much we look alike
I don't know how we did it oh my gosh
you don't have to help me build don't
worry
no good enough no good enough go big dog
okay come on break okay
never let you go down victories mine
Oh
if I'm ready I say even any long too
long for you anyway I thought we were on
fire so it is now actually like 10:00
p.m. super late at night I'm so
exhausted from this weekend but I'm
probably going to head to bed really
soon really quick I wanted to show you
guys what my little like office area
looks like now I'll give you guys like a
mini tour here we have nothing so top I
have my coaster for my mug in the
morning and then I have my black teak
wood candle this little app sign that I
got from home sent to do a DIY with this
I can do it with you guys on camera in a
vlog or something but I want to make
like a dry erase calendar but a really
cute one that actually kind of looks
like art on your wall so that I can do
in a video I already know you guys are
going to say to do it so I'm just going
to go ahead and say I'm going to do it
and then over on this side I just have
my little crystal that changes color
comment down below if you guys have been
watching since I got this because it was
two apartments ago and that means you've
been watching this a long time attend
highlighters things like that and then
in this drawer I just have my dry erase
markers for when I make the calendar up
there this is actually a remote for the
heater that's on my patio if you can't
really see it but that's it right there
and then I have my marble post-it notes
my laptop is in here charging and then
in this drawer I have my like this is
what I just take notes on whenever I
just need a few paper to write something
down really quick this is my journal and
then in the next one this is my aligned
agenda this is my everyday agenda like
without the time slot I'd go pounce
between the two sometimes I use both
sometimes I use one of the other and
then my dream book then this is the
computer chair and I threw this little
faux fur on top of them I'm low-key kind
of obsessed like I can't wait to edit
tomorrow's videos just so I can like sit
down in terms of wrapping up the weekend
it was so much fun hanging it with my
brother this weekend I actually have
missed him so much you guys didn't know
this right before I moved here to
Toronto my brother was like pretty much
living with me so it was nice to have
him up for the week
I'm feeling like we were like roomies
again we eat so much food like it's not
a bad thing I have no regrets but I'm
definitely getting groceries tomorrow
I'm definitely food prepping tomorrow
and I'm definitely hitting the gym
tomorrow because I took two rest days
this weekend and just in general I'm
just like overall feeling exhausted my
arms are ridiculously tired from putting
this thing together I'm not lying
and is how pathetically weak I am but it
is a Sunday so I feel like going to bed
at 10:00 p.m. is kind of justified so
that is it for this vlog I hope you guys
enjoyed if you guys so much for all of
your love and support on my last video
honestly I feel like you know the quote
the truth will set you free I don't
think everything has ever felt so like
applicable in my life honestly just
getting all that off my chest I feel
like it really got it out there like out
of my head and out into the world so I
was like able to kind of let it go we're
like Sam forever I love you guys
honestly so pretty much can we can we
hug I don't know how I'm gonna I'm just
going to hug the camera I feel like my
neighbors are maybe listen to me and
with that I'm out of here and you guys
