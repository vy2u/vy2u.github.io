really really alone right now if
anything happened to me I don't think
anyone would know for like a day or two
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I am doing the ever
requested video to talk about moving it
on your own and living alone and all of
the tips that I have for you guys you
guys aren't following me already I'm
going to leave my Twitter and my
Instagram right here on the screen so
you guys can go ahead click away and
come follow me so without further ado
let's jump into my tips on living alone
so for those of you guys that don't know
I actually recently moved out into my
first apartment all by myself
back in March of this year so when it
comes to tips that I have found have
helped me things that I've kind of come
to terms with or noticed since living
alone the first tip I have for you guys
is if you can get a pet
Bentley is honestly like he pretty much
is Mike my roommate but having a pet
having someone to take care of having
somebody that enjoys your space with you
makes it feel so much less alone and if
you can't get like a dog or cat I'm
serious even just to get a fit just want
to talk to you you know just don't be
like hey making spaghetti for dinner are
you okay with that I know you're not
gonna have any but you know I still want
to take you into consideration there are
so many circumstances that I think I
would have felt so much more alone in
this apartment if it weren't for the
fact that I had Bentley like just
watching TV on the weekends or you know
early Sunday mornings or nights where
I'm working really late and I know that
like everybody's off living their own
lives it looks like Bentley's there if
you're living alone and you can get a
pet just don't second-guess it do it
it's honestly the best thing I think for
anyone that's living alone the second
tip I have for you guys is to make
routines whether it's a morning routine
a night routine weekend routine Friday
routine just come up with as many
routines as possible because when you've
established some sort of routine and
some sort of like comfort level in the
flow that is your life I find that
there's a lot less time spent kind of
wondering what everybody else is doing
or noticing like how alone we are so
when you have a warning routine you wake
up it's just you and your apartment and
you brew yourself some coffee and you
play your favorite music as loud as you
want because you don't have a roommate
telling you
turn it down having routines and doing
certain little things that are just for
you every single day you're just kind of
like it just makes it a lot easier
living alone gets you more comfortable
with the fact that you are on your own
and you have your own routine and it's
just you know your own day-to-day life
feel like I've said you know a lot in
this video already my third tip is to
spend some time on your hobbies if
you're living alone odds are times that
you would have hung out with your
roommate or your brother or your sister
or whoever you're else it was that you
used to live with you can use that time
down towards hobbies and things that
you've kind of put on the back burner Oh
that'd be learning an instrument reading
books getting really into TV shows and
movies that you're just obsessed with
making a youtube channel
or writing or just anything literally
any hobby that you have anytime you feel
alone just spend time doing that hobbies
keep your mind busy keep your life going
like keep growing and learning more
about yourself you won't have time to
realize how lonely you feel if you're
constantly spending any extra time you
have doing the things that you love to
do tip number four is to reach out to
your friends and constantly make plans
it can be ridiculously easy when living
alone to kind of seclude yourself and
pull away from people and kind of expect
them to reach up to you but you have to
give yourself out there you have to
continue to make plans and friends
continue even if you don't live around
any of the people that you know if
you've moved out of town
make plans for a Skype date make plans
for a FaceTime things like that that are
going to keep you connected to your
friends and your family my fifth tip is
to get out of the house now this could
be getting a gym membership take
yourself out to the movies go for a walk
go for a drive just get yourself out I
find especially for me because I work
from home to at that cabin fever
and I noticed that I haven't talked to
anyone really all day so if you make
sure that you're getting out of the
house even if it's to run and go grab
some groceries or grab a coffee just see
the baristas face and say hi getting
outside of my space every now and then
makes it so that coming home is such a
comforting feeling like going out with
friends or going to the gym things like
that I come home and I just feel like I
can completely recharge again in my own
space and then my last and final tip is
to enjoy it honestly if there's going to
come a day where maybe you're married or
you're living with a boyfriend or you
have kids or you're way further down the
line in life and you're going to look
back you're going to miss the
independence in this freedom and just
being able to be on your own and get to
know yourself and put yourself first and
living alone is the perfect time to do
that because there's no one around for
you to constant put your attention on
this is a perfect time to just put your
attention on yourself I know living
alone can seem scary and it can seem
lowly but just find a way to enjoy it as
much as you can find a way to enjoy your
own company get into your hobbies and be
like I said a little bit selfish because
the more present we are within each
chapter the less we're going to feel
guilty about missing it later on in life
so even when it's hard even when it's
lonely even when it's scary enjoy I
think everyone should have a chance to
live alone even if it's just for a few
months because the things you will learn
and the experience you will gain from it
is insane that was it for my tips in
terms of moving out on your own if you
guys have anything to add as always be
sure to comment it down below I hope you
guys enjoyed and that I gave you some
sort of piece of advice to walk away
from this so I love you guys to the moon
back and I will see you guys all in
tomorrow's video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
