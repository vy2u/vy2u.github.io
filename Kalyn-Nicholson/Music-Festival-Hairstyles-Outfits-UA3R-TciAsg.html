for you and a friend there's also a
chance that you could win a year supply
of batiste dry shampoo be sure to click
on the link down below and find out how
you guys could win and other than that
if you guys want to see some adorable
music festival hairstyles and outfits
then just keep watching
so for the first hairstyle I'm going to
be using the batiste dry shampoo in the
scent floral essence and I'm just going
to be spraying this about 10 to 12
inches away from my head into my roots
and this is going to add a little bit of
volume as well as the scent was actually
amazing it smells so good and left my
hair smelling like I literally had just
gotten out of the shower so go ahead and
just spray some of that dry shampoo all
up in your roots and make sure make sure
to massage it in with your fingertips
and in terms of styling my hair this I
just did really really loose curls and
had brushed them through really quickly
so and then just taking a brush and
brushing through my hair yet again one
more time and I'm going to be doing a
side part for this hairstyle and then
I'm just taking a chunk from the arch of
my brow right at the top of my hairline
and then I'm just going to go ahead and
Dutch French braids so basically divides
the chunk of hair into three portions
and normally when you would French braid
you would weave inwards you're going to
want to weave at the braid out words and
add pieces as you go so I mean you can
kind of see what I'm doing here but
basically yeah just do a reverse french
braid and add a couple pieces and then
once you get about halfway down the
braid and just braid the rest of the
hair down and then I'm just going to be
pulling on pieces to make sure that
there's lots of added volume
know as we get down
I can serve all set on fire
please count one two
and then just going ahead and securing
at the braid into place and that is all
you need to do for this first hairstyle
it's super easy but it get your hair off
your face and it still looks super cute
and is perfect for any sort of music
festival so then for this outfit I just
paired a royal blue boho two-piece with
some fringe booties super casual and it
looked really cute with the hairstyle
and really really easy so then for the
next hairstyle I'm going to be using the
batiste dry shampoo and light and blonde
and the awesome thing about this dry
shampoo is it actually has a hint of
color so it's going to help you know
kind of cover up the little bit of roots
that are showing in my hair and again
this one smells absolutely amazing it
was like vanilla I honestly would have
just sprayed this all over me just to
smell good
but I'm just massaging this into my
roots again and making sure that again I
have tons of volume so this is hair
style is going to be perfect for day two
so then after brushing my hair I'm going
to go ahead and put my hair into a
middle part and this is kind of crucial
and then once your hair is in the middle
part you're going to want to take a
section from both sides and then brush
it together in the middle you'll kind of
see what I'm doing here but and then I'm
just taking a brush and then brushing it
backwards so that words is ready to
braid so then again I'm just going ahead
and splitting it into three pieces I'm
not going to be French braiding or Dutch
braiding I'm just going to do a regular
braid towards the back of my head and
then secure it into place
make
so then again I'm going to do the exact
same thing on each side of my head and
just create a normal braid for this you
kind of want to be braiding by the way
at the same time that you're pulling
your hair towards the back of your head
because that's initially where the hair
is going to end up being but yes so
again just go ahead and braid another
chunk on each side of your head and
secure it into place with an elastic
so then once you've done that just go
ahead and take both braids and bring
them towards the back of your head and
then just attach the top one as well and
then take another clear elastic and then
just put that over all three of the
braids so that they are all connected at
the back your head and this hairstyle is
probably my favorite out of the three I
just think it looks so cool and like
gladiator like and again is so perfect
for a festival and keeps your hair off
your face so not only was this my
favorite hairstyle but it was also my
favorite outfit I paired this like lace
maxi with built-in shorts with just a
black crop top some aviators and some
little black booties super easy super
cute and I'm just obsessed and then
again I'm going to be using the hint of
blonde batiste dry shampoo for the third
hairstyle because for this hairstyle
it's more of an updo so I want to make
sure that my roots aren't looking you
know a little bit too Brown so I'm just
going ahead and spraying this into my
hair again and massaging it in with my
fingers and then I'm going to take a
brush or you could take a little comb or
whatever you have on you and then I'm
just going to backcomb the top of my
head just to add a little bit more
volume and again this hairstyle is
perfect for day three because it is
enough dude so be sure to middle part
your hair again for this one and then
bring both sides towards the front and
you're just going to want to do to a
regular braids down your hair and then
once those are done secure those into a
place with a clear elastic you're going
to want to make sure that these are the
clear little rubber ones because you
don't want the elastics to be sticking
out and then what I'm going to do is
just kind of twist the braids a little
bit and then pull it towards the top of
my head and using bobby pins I'm going
to bobby pin all of the pieces down
and then just go ahead and do the exact
same thing with the other side it might
take you a few bobby pins to get all of
the pieces where you need them to be and
if there are any pieces that are kind of
sticking out or pushing out or anything
like that just go ahead and use bobby
pins to secure them into place just make
sure you're tucking them underneath the
braid and then I'm going to finish this
off with a cute little floral headband
just you know add a little bit of just
cuteness and flowers you know you can't
go wrong with a flower headband for a
music festival so that is it for the
third hairstyle super easy and really
cute and then for this last outfit I
just paired this off the shoulder white
crochet top with some high-waisted
distressed jean shorts and some tan
booties this is one of the more casual
if it's but super comfy and I thought it
looked super cute with the hairstyle so
those were all of the hairstyles and
outfits I had to show you guys for this
video be sure to let me know your
favorite down below and also to stock up
on batiste dry shampoo if you guys are
planning on heading to any festivals or
