with Kate from style collective and we
are going to be talking to you guys
about how to survive music festivals
since it can get pretty rough out there
so we're gonna share our survival and
beauty tips on how you guys can survive
and have a great time at these music
festivals for the summer 2014 it's gonna
be awesome
yes it would so I don't know about you
but music festivals can get grimy or
you're very grey basically camping
pretty much and so when you're going to
a festival what is your kind of like get
ready routine like what are your makeup
essentials that you're gonna put on
makeup essentials BB cream or tinted
moisturizer I want to have a little bit
of blush and bronze to me because I mean
you're gonna be outside spring and
summertime I like the golds and the
bronzes and the champagnes for the eyes
I skip the eyeliner and go heavy on the
mascara kind of keeping it fresh face
but still looks like you're wearing
makeup and then a little bit of a peach
lip I would say is my all-time favorite
go-to you know what is really
undervalued is baby wipes that's
actually such a good point and everybody
even thought of that okay loved them so
much
cuz you knew anything like especially
for the gym and all this stuff you can't
shower and no here you go no problem
wipe your hands you wash your face with
them yeah they're definitely essential
they're their life saver you know what I
actually learned the other day that if
you get all kind of shiny the things
like Carmen the toilet yeah serve as
blotting paper really yeah and they get
rid of all the oil off your face yes
that would be perfect for a music
festival because you get very very
sweaty it's such a big crowd it's so hot
so sunny but it would be kind of weird
pulling out when there's a lot in your
face of those people who would probably
look at you a little bit like hey it's
multi-purpose okay yeah so you have a
beautiful like Festival braid in your
favor
it looks great I don't know about you
but my hair is naturally really curly so
in the summer and especially like when
it's like super hot and I'm all sweaty
the hair is just a mess yeah so you
should probably try an anti humidity
spray if you spray it all in your hair
before you go just so it like it's in
the top knot and just throw one of those
like floral headbands that are like
everyone's been getting this spring and
summer and it looks like like you did it
on purpose
my one main thing is like a floral
headband no problem so you no problem
looks crazy put up into a month out of
flora headband you just look like if you
run away you belong and exactly you're
like I belong here now I don't know
about you but some production because I
am very fair especially compared to you
berry can decide it's still very
important that you're outside all day
you want to protect your skin so some
production for sure and you know what
I've started doing is I have you know
this little roll of ones that you can
get yeah I take that because I put
sunscreen in my part judge me and they
like you don't want to get like the we
it's weird when you put white stuff in
right yeah looks all weird yeah but that
one's clean you just go like this no
problem don't have your hair oily no
it's totally fine and with the tinted
moisturizer you want to get one with SPF
for your face because you can never
forget your face and it comes to
sunscreen yeah so shoes what kind of
shoes cuz you want to have comfy shoes
but you don't want to have like ugly
shoes you know there's a fine line there
is you gotta find a balance and ooh I
really like those little like the little
booties with Nokia like I think it's
like good but I go for brown that way
yeah monkey it's no problem wrong from
matches pretty much everything that's
dirty garage where you go dirty as you
want yeah no problem I'm liking the
gladiators but the only thing about
those is it's kind of like you're more
opting for cute than comfort because
they're so flat that after a while your
feet do start to hurt do you have any
like last last tips to kind of things
essentials dry shampoo dry shampoo cuz
your hair is gonna get so sweaty and
there's no way you're gonna fight the
whole Boyle you thing just bring some
dry shampoo my favorite Soleil
have you tried that why do I have I love
the smell of it and it doesn't go on
like in like a weird like
they're on your hair it just completely
just rub it in and it's it's ready to go
la is my all-time I've been using
Trasimene it's alright the Chaz may have
found kind of left a little bit of like
a residue in my hair and I didn't like
it so much so Olay I would say dry
shampoo that's a good one you can get
little tribal sighs yeah and they're
great Packer in your bag yeah
