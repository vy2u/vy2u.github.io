hates being in videos like once I start
talking I think it's like he's weirded
out that there's nobody actually here
that I'm talking to so for today's video
I actually done a video like this but it
was super long time ago and I actually
stumbled across it recently and watching
it again a lot of it still clicked but I
felt like it would be beneficial to do
an updated version and I know that I've
talked about anxiety and depression in
small firts
like here in their births spurts since
most birds like here in they're in
different videos but I've never done one
that's like collective and you know just
like a good old one-two punch right here
I don't know why I'm throwing all of the
most random terms out today also I feel
like I just every single time I sit down
to do a coffee talk and I forget to make
a coffee every time duska so for those
of you guys I don't know I have
struggled with anxiety and depression on
and off for as long as I pretty much can
remember and I actually remember being
really young and thinking that there
might be something wrong with me but
then thinking that maybe I was just
dramatic or I was creating these things
in my head and nothing was actually fun
with me and that I was maybe just doing
it for attention on and off cycle of
like fighting against myself but also
knowing that maybe something wasn't
right and it wasn't until in high school
where I finally went to the doctor and
was diagnosed with housing anxiety
depression and I've been on medications
I've been off medications I've tried
lots of different things I know that
there's such a stigma around youtubers
having anxiety and depression and
there's always comments where it's like
oh every single youtuber struggles with
some sort of mental illness that first
of all I don't even think that that's a
bad thing because I think almost
everybody at some point in their life
shovels with some sort of mental illness
but I also think that that actually
makes sense that a lot of youtubers
would because I know for me and a lot of
people that I know coming on here and
creating this like YouTube world and it
kind of like my escape back in the day
that's kind of what led me here I'm
going to try to make sure the videos in
super long but to give you guys a bit of
a backlog I started to notice my anxiety
the most come high school I was always a
generally social person and definitely
shy part of my Pisces nature to be a
little bit more shy but I was like
painfully shy in high school and I
started to reserve myself and kind of
pull away from people a lot actually
found my high school journal like
yesterday I can see it now and pinpoint
exactly what I was struggling with but
back then I was so confused I didn't
want to like leave my house on the
weekends I would just shelter myself
into my room and like hibernate and
become a hermit I don't think anyone
really knew for a long time I think that
was the worst part of my own mental
illness is that I am somebody that I
struggle with asking people for help I
like to do things on my own I like to be
almost too independent
I just kept a lot of it to myself and I
did enough just to get by so that no one
would ever ask me if there was something
wrong has really bad social anxiety
especially at like parties and stuff so
I ended up just be being a lot of the
time so that I had an escape route I
remember back then just being like why
am i defending so angry and so upset and
kind of beating myself up for it I think
a great deal of it is a mixture of
genetics because mental illness
definitely runs in my family but I also
think a great chunk of it came from even
just things that went on while I was
growing up situations I kind of went
through in high school and teenager and
I think that's all kind of morph this
hypersensitivity to being worried about
absolutely everything like irrational
worry and not only got to being down and
low and sad all the time because any
time I was happy even if it was just a
short spurt of happiness I would
instantly get this pessimistic attitude
where it was like okay but when is it
going to get crappy again like I didn't
actually start dealing with my anxiety
and depression properly I would say
until last year even before last year
when I would talk to you guys about
anxiety and depression I think I was
still just as much in the storm as much
as I liked to talk about it as if I
wasn't I was still very much
with it and this is probably longest
period of my life that I feel like I
haven't been suffering for it so one
thing I want to get out there is I did
try a medication and I don't think that
there's anything wrong with people that
are on medication and if it works for
them but it didn't work for me in the
sense that I didn't like the way it made
me feel I thought that I could find it
somewhere within myself or like I knew I
could find it somewhere within myself to
find an equilibrium some balance in my
life but it wasn't way to be easy it was
going to take me some time and I
definitely had some pretty bad pitfalls
throughout all of that but eventually I
did I found a way to cope with it and to
deal with it and the mindset that I
looked at it with that has changed
everything for me
whether something would trigger the
worry or sometimes it was just this
irrational feeling like all of the
sudden I should be worrying about
something even if there's nothing to
worry about the minute I started to
worry about something it was just like a
domino effect on everything else in my
life there was not one part of my life
that I wasn't worried about even though
part of me would know that it was
irrational part of me would be like I
feel like I'm being a little bit over
the top of this it was like this
overwhelming dominant need that over
through every other sense of logic that
I had to worry
and then what sucks about that is that
created this unsure mindset within
myself where I started to second-guess
everything if I was really happy I would
second guess if this was the right
decision I would second-guess myself on
everything I would second guess if I was
crazy I would wonder if I was fake I
would start to honestly just beat myself
to oblivion but then would lead to panic
attacks started happening a lot later on
in high school for me pretty much went
up to about as you collapse panic attack
I had was like six months ago where I
would almost build up so much worried
that I would feel like I was either
going to throw up or have a heart attack
or a mixture of both and that's the only
feeling I can explain it's like in your
chest where you think maybe you're going
to be sick but you also feel like you're
going to just like freak out and your
whole body just starts to vibrate
I get like tingling my legs and
sometimes going numb
and I would have to actually curl up
into like a fetal position and breathe
it out or just freak out for a solid
minute or two I couldn't stop my brain
from creating these unrealistic beliefs
about everything about the whole world
about myself about everything going on
in front of me it made me lose sleep it
made me overeat it made me under eat it
made me miserable
it made me irritable hibernating and
pulling myself away from the world and
like keeping myself into this tight
little comfort zone where I never tried
anything new and didn't reach out to
people didn't push myself I was a hot
mess it's the only way I can describe it
trying to let that little tiny part of
you that's being logical and sensible
about it all over take everything else
it's honestly like swimming against a
strong current it's almost nearly
impossible and so feeling all these
things obviously I started to get really
down on myself and feel really crappy
about myself and wonder why I was that
way which then created this cycle where
after starting to get anxious about
anything I would soon follow it up with
getting super depressed and down because
I'd be really upset with myself and I'd
be really upset with everything going on
all of this tricked my brain into like
absolutely being like the absolute worst
and meanest to myself and of course when
you're in that kind of mindset is hard
not to get depressed you don't want to
leave your bed you don't want to get up
you don't think there's any hope it
leads to a numbness that is one of the
most hollow feelings in the world you
and I was not hating the world you don't
hate anyone else it just leads to this
cell feature that is so consuming I
can't
I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy
each and every time I had to deal with
it it took me a little less time to kick
it and I decided like I was going to do
something about this I was going to no
matter how hard it took me I was going
to fight it even if I ended up fighting
it till the day I died I was going to do
it that was pretty much right around the
time I was home from college and decided
that I had to just completely start
fresh like clean slate go back home and
try it all again and I started
journaling I started
testing out completely different things
I went through a lot of different phases
and throughout all of this again I was
going back and forth within and out of
feeling anxious feeling depressed
getting to some really low points in my
life but then also hitting some really
nice like happy points in my life each
and every time I got better and stronger
and faster at kicking the mindsets that
I would fall into I figured out if that
was my routine the whole worrying
triggering the anxiety which would then
trigger the depression which would then
trigger back to anxiety or trigger back
to depression in a very visual person so
I had to like come up with some sort of
concepts that I could grasp or wrap my
head around that was kind of like the
first moment for me that I started to
deal with it was when I caught I caught
on to it I was like this is a cycle I I
can physically like I needed to
visualize it anytime I felt myself
getting anxious or depressed I would
start to fight against myself even if I
didn't believe it I would just continue
I think some people call them like
affirmations I don't like aloud say
affirmations to myself but anytime I had
a negative thought I would try and catch
myself right in the minute of it and
then fight against it I had to stop
listening to the darker negative
pessimistic side of me you have to learn
to untrust
the like devil on your shoulders and
have a Chinese fight against it with
some truth or you know some realistic
sauce or some more positive thoughts
even though I knew that that was the
right way I knew that that was logical
still felt so real to worry took a lot
of fighting against myself and not
trusting myself and rewiring the whole
cycle that I had like deeply ingrained
into my mind kind of reconditioning my
brain to see the truth for what it is or
to see life for what it is before I
found the way to kick myself out of that
and I think the reason why it is so hard
is because when you're anxious and when
you're depressed in your own head you
think that you're looking out for
yourself by setting yourself up for the
worst that can happen but your brain
doesn't actually process what could be
the worst thing that can happen because
it is just like spiraling out of control
in your old head for what
reason it seems like I'm just trying to
be real with myself because everything
you've known up to that point has been
negative or pessimistic or at least us
the filter you looked at everything at
and that was like the justification
within myself to continue to worry and
to continue to be depressed because I
was like I'm just preparing myself this
is just the way life is and it was so
it's so sad and it's so untrue but it
feels so real anyone that has ever
struggled with any sort of mental
illness tends to struggle with
confidence and being sure of themselves
and decisiveness because their whole
life is them against them or them versus
them are you fighting your own self and
your own thoughts it makes it almost
impossible to trust yourself it makes it
almost impossible to believe the good
things that you're trying to tell
yourself during those dark times
cuz you literally spend your whole life
just fighting you you have to break down
the trust within yourself the bad
unreliable like unhealthy trust so that
you can then rebuild it again in a more
positive light and more realistic light
I've gotten better now but I used to
struggle a lot with testing myself and
feeling like I knew who I was because my
whole life I've been fighting against
myself was I am pessimistic person or
was I just mentally ill and I wasn't
just that wasn't actually who I was you
know what I mean I constantly struggled
because I was identifying with my
anxiety and depression and not realizing
that that wasn't who I was and I had to
see the truth and fight against the
parts of me that wanted to believe that
make room or make ways for the parts of
me that were true it was a hard thing to
do because how do you know which is
which that is where like a lot of boats
came and helped for me like you are
badass or the seller of not giving us up
that is where a lot of like writing
helped me like physically writing out in
journals because I could get my thoughts
down on paper and then kind of sit back
and look at them I would look at it from
someone else's perspective because
someone I knew was dealing with the same
problem or thinking the same thoughts
what would I tell them and I think when
you do that it makes it easier because
you separate yourself from it whatever
you're struggling with if you write it
down and then you look at it and pretend
it someone close to you this writing
this or feeling that way you can
suddenly give them the
but you really should be giving yourself
and that's kind of how I started to see
the truth of it all but know a lot of
people that have struggled with anxiety
and depression too and so once I started
to see the other people around me that I
really cared about struggle with it it
killed me to know that people that were
important to me and that I loved so much
couldn't see them the way that I saw
them crazy when you look at the people
that are close to you or important to
you or that inspired you and wonder how
they couldn't see that in themselves and
so that was another huge thing that
started to help me and so I started
building up all of these fundamental
blocks so that every time I fell off
kilter I had a back-up plan
I had like a net waiting to catch me and
then the last thing that I think really
helped me and still helped me when I do
fall back into those pits and those
downfalls and those ruts is having core
values and top priorities and those were
two things that I had to kind of sit
down and write out I didn't want to be
the type of person that got people's
attention because I needed help I wanted
to be the type of person that got
people's attention because I made them
feel good about themselves and the only
way I knew I could make people feel good
about themselves is if I started to feel
good about myself
and I knew that there was no way I was
going to be able to do that by leaning
or asking anyone else to help me I had
to pick myself up off the ground and I
had to find the truth for myself so that
I could turn around and spend my time be
there for the people around me and I
couldn't be there or do the things or be
the person I wanted to be if I was
constantly feeling down and low I wasn't
going to be a positive source for anyone
else if I was a negative source on my
own every time I caught myself being an
energy sucker any time I caught myself
falling into these victim mentalities or
these like pessimistic worrisome mindset
I started to fight against them faster
to the side because it was a decision
which thought I was going to believe and
it's crazy now because I remember
thinking back in the day I would have
given anything to not have any sort of
mental illness to just wake up and feel
like I could just be normal like I could
just go about my day and not have to
constantly pep-talk my
all through every single thing I was
doing now I wouldn't trade what I went
through for the world I would trade the
fact that I know I'll probably still go
through phases of falling in and out of
having anxiety and depression for the
rest of my life a part of the way and
the reason why I am Who I am today and
finding a place where you start to like
the person you are and you start to like
the energy you feel that is like it
makes all of it worth it I'm going to go
through mental illness and go through
fighting yourself makes the feeling of
having good energy and being in a good
place
better brings me so much joy that I
don't think I would feel if I just felt
this way my whole life by having my core
values and having my top priorities my
core values being that I wanted to be
like a source of good energy to people
around me that I wanted to be a good
person and make people feel good about
themselves I wanted to be a hard worker
and I wanted to be someone that people
could go to when things weren't going
right and I wanted to be the type of
person that went upbeat and happy and
energetic and ready to take on the
ventures mixing that with my top
priorities being my friends my family my
health that is how I fight my way back
out of these things that is how I find a
little bit more balance and with the
truths that I've learned and with the
mistakes I have made in the past and the
lessons that I learned from them in the
mindsets that I gained from them
fighting the battle instead of wondering
why we have it realizing that everybody
has problems everybody goes through
these types of things and it's in
solving our problems and fixing these
things that we find the true meaning
awaits the true happiness that we've
always been looking for for any of you
guys that might be struggling with this
I don't know if maybe I'm making it
sound super easy and I'm keeping on this
like super smiley face like super up the
energy but it was I can't describe to
you the mindsets I was in the places I
was in the dark parts of my life not
wanting to be alive not wanting to exist
not wanting to feel not wanting just
wanting to numb out or escape or get
away from it all I was there so I hope
that I'm not being insensitive or making
it sound like it's easy peasy because
it's not I would never minimize
that on anyone I just figured sharing my
story and sharing to you guys kind of
what I've gone through and how I've
dealt with it where it's brought me to
this place today there is hope there's
always always hope faith in yourself yes
though space in your future and you have
to face that good things are coming
everybody on this earth deserves to be
happy
genuinely honestly happy and share that
energy and so I honestly truly believe
that it will happen even if it doesn't
feel like it and one day you'll look
back on it and you'll realize it'll all
make sense hold on to that you guys need
any help make sure you guys reach out
