gonna rise
well howdy and welcome back to my
channel today is currently Friday and I
am just cleaning up all of my stuff I
just filmed a bunch of videos I'm
actually about to head to the grocery
store to grab some groceries my sister
is on her way here from Ottawa she's
actually taking the train up so I'm
running to the grocery store to make
sure that I have stocked food because
you know when you have a guest
usually you like to feed them and I have
no groceries right now and then when she
gets here we have a reservation at this
place called Tchibo in Toronto it's a
really cool wine bar and she's gonna be
here for the whole weekend which is
super exciting because as you guys know
with COEs and with you Tober I have not
had a social life and it is going to
feel mighty good take the weekend to
kind of hang out with my sister and
catch up and just like have some girl
time I also have a really cool plans to
this like DIY in this vlog so definitely
stay tuned to the end of the video for
that cuz I'm assuming I'll do that
Sunday night after she leaves but in the
meantime let's run to the grocery store
let's go get food girl's weekend I feel
like I should be like oh oh girls just
wanna have fun huh maybe I can find like
a royalty-free remix
own in the morning light my mother says
when you gonna live your life right
Rezo inside 10:15 Oh
farming's in the middle of the night my
father yells what you gonna do with your
life Oh daddy you know you're still
number one with girls
Oh girls just
some fun
so we just got back from the mall we
also went to Kensington my hair is like
this was straight yesterday this is just
from like sweat and humidity it's
actually really really hot out today so
I'm just gonna share with you guys like
the few little things that I grabbed
from the mall today there's like a few
things that needed to get in particular
and then a few things that I kind of
splurged on the first place we went was
indigo and I needed to get a few
notebooks so this one is my video
planning notebook that you guys saw in
my desk tour which you haven't seen and
I'll pop up on the screen the notebook
that I used to plan out my videos and
that is actually filling up I think
there's like two pages left so I picked
up a new one to plan videos I also
grabbed Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire because I finished the third one
two weeks ago and I just finished
girlboss yesterday so this is the next
book on my reading list for the false
and I have a notebook that I got for
COEs and a little post-it note thing
that has a bunch of different kinds of
post-it notes next we went to Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works and the few things I got
there are I picked up a new body lotion
because mine just right now I got the
birch and Argan and it smells so good I
wish there was like a scent cam where I
could like put this up and you guys
could actually smell it but it smells so
good I picked up a hand lotion at the
pumpkin spice pumpkin cider I couldn't
choose between these two so I decided to
get like the mini version and then I
also picked up two candles the first one
so many of you guys tweeted this candle
at me and you guys are like you need to
get this so I went and got it and it
says but first coffee and the actual
smell of this is coffee and then I
grabbed a second line the second one I
grabbed I'm running out of a lot of my
fall candles have been burning through
them so fast so I picked up autumn
because I haven't grabbed this one yet
this year and this one's like my
favorite fall one with a perfect mixture
of leaves and apples and then last but
not least we went to Sephora and I
picked up two sets of lashes they are
these ones here it is the velour lie
detector and velour fluff to thick the
last thing I purchased was a new
foundation I got the cap on D lock-it
Foundation I'm in the color medium 50
three yeah that was like everything I
got from the mall nobody went to
Kensington Market and had some tacos
which were top-notch now we're gonna
work on this like secret project we have
that haven't told you guys but yeah and
put on some face masks and then we're
going to plant it tonight for dinner so
if you guys are from Toronto you might
know of planta but is this really good
vegan restaurant in Yorkville so we're
heading there around 7:30 in the
meantime cue some face masks beard guys
I put it on my eyebrows between you
missile unibrow now I'm gonna have to
rip up my eyebrows okay maybe I'll just
wipe it off my eyebrows before it dries
maybe my hands like I'll let they tell
you to put a thick layer on but they
don't give you enough - we put a thin
layer on top I feel like it's gonna be
really hard to peel this off there's
like not very much on our faces
I've become
Oh
so Kyra's now gone which is super sad it
was so fun having her up for the weekend
I haven't hung out with my sister like
that in so long so if I didn't vlog that
much footage I'm sorry and like an oily
potato chip right now what the heck as I
was saying I've been editing and sending
up shipments and doing youtuber videos
and pre-planning all these things and
like stock and inventory and all this
stuff and I freaking love doing it don't
get me wrong but it felt really nice to
kind of just like decompress and hang
out with my sister for like a day and a
half and not like touch any of that I
already feel ready for tomorrow like
tomorrow is Monday and I'm feeling ready
for it and now that she's gone I feel
like I'm just gonna spend the rest of my
Sunday jesting actually did a whole like
vlog style video on my Sunday routine
which I'll pop up on the screen but in
the meantime that's kind of my plan
right now hue the Sunday gist I bet
you're expecting a huge beat drop there
and you know a bunch of chores and just
in turns out my plans have changed Greg
ended up calling me on the way back from
the cottage and asking if I wanted to
grab some dinner and hang out
to which I replied yes he's on the side
of grab me we're gonna go grab some
sushi maybe go see it in theaters which
I've heard is actually really good or
watch Game of Thrones here because if
you guys have been watching my vlogs
lately probably recognize that we're
quite obsessed right now for my outfit
I'm wearing this sweater that I got from
a Rydia a skirt from Nordstrom I won't
be wearing these slippers out but I'll
probably switch the slippers for you
know some booties she felt like it was
time to milk some cows I'm the sunset
right now it's like the most beautiful
thing ever just freakin hello we've got
going on here so instead of queueing you
know chores interesting queue sushi
around my heart will never be much
faster before you came I was ready to
so it is absolutely now a few days later
it's Thursday I believe and I just
finished making my dream door with you
guys ended up being the finished result
so I decided to put it on my laundry
room door because it's in such a central
part to my apartment that it's gonna be
impossible like not to see it all the
time
and if you guys watched my most recent
Q&amp;amp;A one of you guys asked how exactly to
stay focused on your goals and your
dreams and I honestly think that the
easiest way and the best way to
constantly say inspire it's just
surround yourself with the types of
things that you're trying to attract
into your life the things that you're
working towards like I don't know how
much you guys believe in the law of
attraction but I have like this weird
suspicion that it works I'm a very
visual person and so I like having
things like up in front of my face and
displayed to me especially on days where
I'm not feeling you know the greatest or
days where you just kind of feel drained
and you forget or lose sight of what it
is that you're working towards feel like
that's why I love dream boards and like
inspiration boards it's kind of like an
instant reminder of the things that are
important to you and the things that you
are striving for and I can also kind of
act as a reality check even just sitting
down and having to ask myself like what
are my goals what are my dreams and what
pictures would dictate that it becomes
super apparent to you suddenly what
you've been holding as a priority in
your life and what you've kind of let
slide and while there's so many
different ways to make a dream board I
decided to just print out pictures
of things that inspired me in each photo
to make sure that I wasn't choosing them
for like aesthetic reason then I used my
notebook and wrote down for every single
photo what that dream or goal was to me
and it's now gonna be something that not
only I'm gonna see all the time when I'm
walking through my apartment but that I
can also have as a list for those days
where you're just so stressed and you're
wondering like what the point of it all
is plus it's just another list that I
can just start checking off now even
though it might take me you know quite a
few years so I'm gonna leave in the
description box just like a really easy
point form of exactly what I did to make
my dream board as well as like my vCard
at which a lot of the images on there
were from and if you guys decide to make
a dream board I'd definitely be sure to
tag me on Instagram and on Twitter so
that I can check it out and other than
that I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog

super fun there's so much coming up over
the next little bit but I do have a bit
of an sad announcement as we are
