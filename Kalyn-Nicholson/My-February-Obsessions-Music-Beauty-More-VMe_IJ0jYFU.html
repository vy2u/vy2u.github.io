to be doing my February favorites and
I'm wearing a hat because my hair looks
really weird and gross right now and
yeah I just decided to wear a hat I feel
like it's very different when I look in
the viewfinder and I see a big hat on my
head I keep getting very confused I
think I want to start getting into doing
more favorite videos like monthly
favorite videos but I'm not gonna style
them so that they're based just on
beauty I really want to make them more
so like just my favorite things for the
whole month of February like things that
I was obsessed with that in my entire
life like not just beauty and style but
like music and apps and books and just
everything I've obsessed with for the
whole month so I don't know if I'm gonna
be doing these every single month and it
all depends on how much you guys ends up
liking these style videos so we'll test
it out with this one and if you guys
liked it thumbs it up or just comment
below saying that you guys want more
like basically lifestyle obsessions for
the month so I'm gonna I'm calling this
my February favorites I'm gonna call
this my February obsession February was
a great month because it was my 21st
birthday in Valentine's Day and it just
kind of I feel like ends winter and I'm
so sick of winters so I'm going to start
with the one thing that I probably used
the post this month and even though I
got it towards the end of the month it's
this purse so this purse is from forever
21 but it looks like a designer purse
and we all know that I don't like to
spend a lot of money on designer purses
so I try to find knockoffs and faux
leather of course so this is the purse
that I picked up and this is in the
color taupe and I've been literally
grabbing this each time I go to leave
the house no matter what my outfit is it
just it always fits my outfit I'm like a
it's just been my go-to person for
pretty much the second half of February
and I'm obsessed with it my next monthly
obsession is a nail polish and the nail
polish I found that I wore the most in
the month of February was just my OPI in
Alpine
No so basically every time I went to go
paint my nails this month I just kept on
wanting to grab white and I think it's
just because it's such an easy classic
color and it looks good with a tan and
it matches everything so I've been going
for white and then I have it three
makeup products to show you guys that I
pretty much used like obsessively this
month so the first one is my maybelline
superstay foundation no I had this for a
while but it's just been tucked away in
my foundation drawer so I ended up
pulling it out this month and it's been
my go-to all month because I find it
just gives a really good good coverage
without looking too cakey because my
skin was starting to get really cakey
and dry lately so I find this has helped
a lot
along with exfoliating but I've been
obsessing over it and using it pretty
much every day as my go-to next is my
Too Faced primed and poreless powder and
you guys if you see might have seen my
haul you'll know when I picked this up
but this has been my go-to powder for
basically as long as I've had it it's
been the only one that I've been using
and it's because I just love the finish
it gives it actually does I find
minimize the size of my pores and it
just looks very like porcelain so I
really like this translucent powder and
next I've been getting really into doing
a gel liner lately instead of liquid
liner so my obsession has been my Sigma
gel liner and a wicked so obviously it's
in black I've been doing gel liner now
pretty much for the past two months and
I think I actually might say I like it
better than liquid I just like the look
of it better I like that it's more matte
and not as shiny as liquid eyeliner so
this has been my obsession lately as
well the candle that I found I burnt the
most in the month of February is my
marshmallow fireside my mom actually
picked this up for me for Christmas and
I wasn't sure if I was going to like it
because I actually don't like
marshmallows I'm someone that I love to
be cozy and I'm sure you guys already
know that so to kind of burn this at
night when we have our fireplace going
and we're just relaxing watching our
shows I just love it and it's such a
warm and like it's a very warm and sweet
smells my next favorite is another
beauty slash like
of hygiene product so it has been my
Olay Regenerist luminous overnight mask
so it's sort of like a moisturizer but
not really it absorbs into your skin
over the night and basically what I'll
do is at the end of the day I when I
wash up all my makeup I'll put this on
and go to bed basically and it absorbs
into your skin like a mask instead of
washing it off it absorbs in and the
next day my skin feel is basically just
super super soft and my next obsession
has been this hat I'm sure you guys have
seen this hat in many pictures now but I
find when I'm running out of the house
my sister and I we would run out to grab
sushi completely last minute or when I'm
running to go run errands and my hair
isn't done I'll just throw this hat on
let me switch hats for you guys so this
will always just be like the hot that I
Terrell them when I'm running out of the
house just to go run errands or to grab
a coffee or just my hair is not done or
I want to throw it in a ponytail or a
bun I'll just throw this hat on so it
kind of covers up either if I have
second date greasy kind of hair or if my
hair isn't styled or like I haven't used
heat on it and it's just a messy poof
ball I'll be - I usually throw my NY hat
on it to run out of the house so next
I'm sure you guys have seen me as in a
lot of pictures too but the sunglasses
that I'm currently obsessed with are
from urban planet they are the tortoise
shell colors so they have like the brown
and black detailing all around the rim
and the frame and the sides and then
just a little gold piece in the middle
and then the color of them are kind of
like sepia if you guys know what I'm
talking about like the photo filter
sepia so they're more of like a tan
frame or Tamplin sorry and then when you
put them on they just make everything
look more tanned or like more orange
toned or yellow toned but I've just been
obsessed with them I love the size of
them and the shape of them and yeah
these have just been Mako - sunglasses
again for when running out of the house
or any pretty much any outfit I just
throw on these sunglasses as my go to
last but not least I'd like to talk
about a book that I've been obsessed
with for the month of February so as you
guys know I'm really into reading I'm
usually always reading a book all the
time and late
I've been getting into reading two books
at a time where I'll read a book that
has a story line and then a book that's
more like nonfiction so I have been
really kind of exploring my inner
Buddhists lately I've always felt like I
was meant to be kind of like a hippie or
a Buddhist or you guys know what I mean
but basically the book that I've been
obsessed with lately is called before
agreements now I highly highly highly
highly highly highly recommend this book
for those of you that just I don't know
if for those of you that are looking
just for some inspiration in your life
or you're looking to read something
that's just so positive and just
completely changes your outlook or your
perspective on the world and life and
just everything about it then I highly
recommend this book
it's basically living your life based on
the Toltec path if you're someone that's
not very spiritual that might kind of
sound very intimidating but I promise
you it isn't it's basically about living
your life based around four agreements
or four rules that you make with
yourself the four agreements are to be
impeccable with your word don't take
anything personally don't make
assumptions and always do your best and
it's basically a book telling you how to
live your life by those four rules and
how to change your mind to see the world
and perceive the world in a different
way than we were taught growing up we're
kind of we're kind of just told the way
things are like this is how it is and
that's just how it's going to be and
this book kind of breaks down those
fundamentals in your brain and show you
that you don't have to see worlds out
the world that way you don't have to
shine everything with a negative light
that you can shine it with a more
positive light and you can live your
life basically invincible to negativity
if you go by The Four Agreements of the
four rules anytime I have any chance to
kind of sit down and read I read this
book or I've been reading the other book
that I've been reading for this month
and that is flawless
aka book 2 in Pretty Little Liars but my
non-fiction obsession has been before
agreements so I highly highly recommend
it and if you guys want to see more book
reviews or book hauls let me know down
below and I can start putting those up
on my second channel and explaining to
you guys just the books that I read
because I am a Advaitic reader I love to
read books I love just like escaping to
a completely different world so if that
is something that you guys want to start
seeing I can
easily put those up on my second channel
so just let me know and I will be sure
to do it and then of course as for music
I have made a bunch of playlists this
month if you guys don't know I usually
do music Monday where I'll make a new
music playlist on my 8 tracks every
single Monday and I literally do it for
fun I don't get paid to do it or
anything I just love music and I love
making playlists so I'll leave all the
playlists that I made for the month of
February down below but an album that
I've been super obsessed with for this
month has been 1989 big shocker you guys
know I'm like a Taylor Swift addict like
number one fan huge fan of Taylor says
so I've been obviously listening to her
album probably one of the most for the
month of February but another album that
I've been really really obsessed is for
the month of February and this guy is so
unknown and I just blows my mind because
his music is so good
his name is Adam again or Adam egg and I
not sure how to say his last name but
his album is called rainy days and
sleepless nights and his oh I just can't
even explain to you his music is my life
and he's been like my other go-to if I'm
not listening to 1989 I'll usually
listen to his album and his music is
just so good
so yeah his music is absolutely amazing
his honor is more singer-songwriters so
if you're into that thing then you'll
absolutely love this guy and I'll link
his album down below so that has been my
February obsessions let me know down
below if you guys enjoyed this video or
if it wasn't really your thing and other
than that I will see you guys all in a
future video let me know down below
would have been your obsessions for the
month of February and I hope you guys
all have an amazing month of March and
that it treats you well so other than
that I will see you guys all in a future
