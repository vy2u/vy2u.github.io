you you take my love Freddie
I just don't understand it all I took
her to you I'm went to her to you you
take my love for granted I just don't
understand hey guys so for today's video
I wanted to do what my fitness routine
with you guys this video has been highly
requested for quite some time now but I
hadn't filmed it because I wanted to
make sure that it was something that was
kind of being consistent with before
filming this video so pretty much ever
since I moved into this apartment I have
been really getting back into you know
like working out and eating healthy not
that I really wasn't before but only
recently has it felt like my routine has
been like fully established and that
I've been consistent I am going to share
with you guys today what my fitness
routine is I'm going to go over like the
things I like to eat what my schedule or
like my routine looks like must-haves
what music I like to listen to we're
going to cover all of the good stuffs
you guys want to know what my fitness /
health routine then just keep watching
okay so let's start out with the basics
so recently my routine has been cracking
on 6 a.m. I get a I alarm goes off I
hate it I get so bad for like the first
5 minutes but I always try and kind of
remind myself that I'm only going to be
that lethargic and want to crawl back
into bed for a few minutes so as long as
I can sit on the ground and kind of
force myself not to climb back into bed
I find it takes just a few minutes for
that grogginess to wear off and then I'm
awake a quick tip that I like to do is
to set out my workout clothes the night
before I set it right by my phone where
my alarm goes off so that way when I
wake up it's just sitting there staring
at me so that I feel judged if I don't
put it on and if I just go back to bed I
also usually keep my daily schedule kind
of sitting right beside that as well I
get such satisfaction off of checking
things off because I'm such a dork I
will quickly change into my workout gear
and make myself a coffee I try not to
eat before I run in the mornings just
because I find it slows me down and it
also gives me like cramps sometimes I
like to run down by the water sometimes
I like to run through like the Foresti
trails sometimes just in my neighborhood
things like that I usually run about 5
to 6 kilometers every single time and a
few things that I absolutely must have
while working out are my head
I have via beats by dre these were like
the best purchase I ever made in my life
they are super pricey but they are so
worth it because I am somebody that
really likes like really hardcore bass
and then the other thing that is a huge
huge huge must-have for me is my arm
band now I'm somebody that I don't like
to kind of carry a lot of things when I
run so as long as I have my arm band for
my phone and a pocket in like my
leggings or my shorts for my key that is
all I need and then of course my water
bottle too now everybody always asks me
where I got this water bottle it was
from urban planet I always make sure to
fill it up the night before I go to bed
and keep it in the fridge so that it's
ice-cold for my run in the morning so I
typically try to run about five days a
week because I do have bad ankles and a
really really bad knee so I find doing
more than five days actually just doing
five days in general I can feel it it's
kind of painful but I figure giving
myself two days of rest is usually
pretty good and then two to three times
a week I like to do a bodyweight
exercises after my run so I'll usually
come home lay out my yoga mat and then I
have ankle weights I also have just like
free weights or whatever the ankle
weights are 2.5 pounds each and I'll
throw those on and do some like ab
exercises or leg exercises another thing
I like to do is take the weights and do
lunges or do squats I know it's been
requested to kind of do a full video
about bodyweight exercises so it is
still on the list of videos to do and
then another must-have for me is my
running app I like to see physical
numbers in front of me so I use either
the Fitbit app or the run keeper um I
actually technically use both every
single time I run I track my run because
I like seeing if I've gotten any faster
or just to see the distance so I'll
leave a link to run keeper and the
Fitbit app down below so then moving on
through the night um one thing I like to
do normally I wouldn't say I do this
every single night but I always get this
like urge to stretch late at night it
sounds really a lot of the times not
every night I was going to say again
maybe like five nights a week I
typically will sit down and stretch
while watching like TV listening to
music hanging out of my computer
whatever it is so this is a tip that I
found has extremely helped in terms of
my flexibility it also helps kind of
keep me less sore I find I don't know
maybe that's just in my head
but I find it just really really helps
and also it just it's nice to do before
you go to sleep because then you just
feel like I don't even know how to
explain it your body just feels so
loosey goosey and speaking of stretching
like I've told you guys probably a
thousand times before another thing I
really like to do is yoga at home a goal
of mine for August is to sign up for the
hot yoga classes so that might be
something that I'll add to my fitness
routine I will keep you guys posted but
in terms of yoga I like to do you'll get
home I like yoga with Adriene a lot I'll
also just sometimes roll out my mat and
do my own kind of yoga or my own
stretches again I will leave a link down
below to a bunch of like at-home yoga
videos so moving into the things that I
like to wear normally I like to go with
like leggings and a tank top that's
usually my typical go to i don't like to
necessarily wear anything too tight or
constricting when running but that said
sometimes I like to wear tops like this
tight t-shirt style tops are more so my
favorite when I'm doing like bodyweight
exercises or anything like that because
I find they kind of ride up when I run
and then of course there's like shorts
and I like the ones that have like the
lining underneath and then they're kind
of loose on top those are my favorite to
get and I always get them from forever
21 because they're like 17 dollars
they're super super cheap and for shoes
another question I get commonly asked I
recently purchased the Nike Free Runs
now let's get to everybody's favorite
part and that is as you guys probably
already know I am vegan I like to try to
follow a high carb low fat vegan diet
but I'm not going to say that I'm strict
about it I still eat a lot of avocado I
still eat a lot of hummus if I'm going
to be really honest with you guys right
now give you guys a rundown of what like
a typical day of eating looks like for
me in the morning I like to have like
water and coffee as I already told you
guys after my run I will make myself
breakfast this will usually either be
like I'll just eat a cup of bananas or
I'll cut up like a fruit bowl or I'll
make myself a smoothie lunch time
typically tends to be a stir-fry I like
rice a lot and I eat a lot of rice so I
only eat basmati it's just like a
preference thing with vegetables
sometimes I'll throw tofu in there
sometimes I will throw like fresh salad
mix or tomatoes or anything like that
it's literally whatever is in my fridge
I will throw it in I have gone sodium
free so I've completely cut sodium from
my diet or just adding sodium anyway
like there's obviously still sodium in
things but I never
add salt to anything anymore which is
huge for me because I used to add so
much salt to everything I've also cut
out diet Pepsi's and sweeteners so I no
longer add sweetener into my coffee
anymore and I no longer drink diet
Pepsi's or anything like that so what
lunch will typically either be like a
rice dish or a salad with a rice dish or
anything like that or dinner I like to
make again another sort of like bootable
or rice dish I'll make quinoa rice
fajita is Mexican food sweet potatoes
have been a huge huge favorite of mine
one of like the best tricks or recipes
that I could ever tell you guys is to
bake to sweet potatoes basically take
all of like the the middle part of the
potato out into a bowl and mash it up
and then I will put like a garlic pasta
sauce on top this is like a good dupe if
you're someone that really likes ravioli
I used to be obsessed with like three
cheese ravioli a little bit of garlic
powder pepper and then put your favorite
pasta sauce on top it just I don't know
why it just reminds me of ravioli and
then aside from that I drink a lot of
water I drink a lot of coffee and I
drink a lot of peppermint tea those are
like my three favorite beverages and the
on time too for snacks and such I will
have like crackers and hummus orange
juice is another big fave of my fruit
dates anything like that my diet
probably seems very boring to a lot of
you guys but I've just become so
accustomed to eating this way and I've
like really kind of trained my taste
buds to learn to love like the taste of
just more whole natural foods I guess
but don't get me wrong this is not my
routine every single day there are so
many days that I go out and get burritos
that I go out and get Thai food like pad
thai I'm just kind of tried to minimize
having like cheat meals to once a week
so that has been my most recent fitness
health and diet routine I hope you guys
enjoyed be sure to check out all of the
links down below for everything that I
pretty much talked about in this video
and then that I will see all of you guys
in a future video bye guys
what a fool
but it wait for luck today but if you
say goodbye to save but if what if we're
hard to find what if what if we lost the
mines but if you get the far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
