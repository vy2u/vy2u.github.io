wondering my neighbors and welcome back
to my channel for today's video I'm
doing a Christmas obsessions video with
you guys so I'm gonna be sharing with
you guys all the things that I obsess
with over the Christmas time and I want
you guys to leave your answers to all of
the obsessive things down low so I can
see what you guys are obsessing with
over the holiday season a Christmas
movie that I tend to obsess with the
most over the holiday season is always
elf and honestly it's just the matter of
fact that like I love a lot of Christmas
movies but elf it's just so my humor
like Will Ferrell is hilarious in that
movie there are so many one-liners I can
pretty much quote the whole movie every
single time I watch it
it's definitely by far my favorite
Christmas movie there's so many other
good ones too but if if it boiled down
to it and I had to choose my absolute
favorite it would 100% PL this was
actually I think I like fully realize
this the other day on my live stream one
of the questions was what was your
favorite holiday song and it hit me that
like out of all of the great and amazing
holiday music here is my favorite one
and it's only my favorite because I love
to belt it out and like sing it is Blu
Christmas by Elvis it's like a sad
Christmas song it's my favorite too for
the holiday time and also it's just like
one of those songs that you always hear
in the background of every single like
holiday party or Christmas Day or just
movies
my favorite holiday drink I will share
with you guys of my Starbucks order
since we did that this fall remember
when we were all drinking the sugar-free
cinnamon Dolce latte well my favorite
drink at the holiday time is I like to
get a nice dough made with coconut milk
and sugar-free peppermint basically what
a miso is is it's like a coffee but they
steam the milk that you get so they
steam the coconut milk that said I
recently went to Starbucks and actually
picked up their sugar-free peppermint
syrup so I could just start making
peppermint coffees at home and save
myself a wack ton of money you think you
guys like drinking peppermint coffee
around the holidays I highly suggest
saving money by picking up the syrup
itself and then you're gonna shake my
camera so next is tradition and my I
feel like I have to that I can't choose
there's two different traditions that I
love to do that are like a family
tradition at Christmastime the first one
is making appetizers on Christmas Eve we
always make a crap-ton of like zucchini
sticks and like dips and just so many
different appetizers and then we snack
on them and we play board games but as
for like Christmas Day traditions my
absolute favorite thing that we still do
to this day even though me and my
brother and my sister are all grown up
now we still get up at like 5:00 a.m.
like we used to when we were kids I'm
not kidding you every single Christmas
ever since I was a kid we would always
get up at like 4:00 or 5:00 in the
morning when it's still dark out to open
all of our presents and then we'd all go
back to bed
well everyone pretty much except for my
little brother and I would go back to
bed
and we would just like play with our
toys until the Sun came up and it's just
something that we still do even now that
we're all older we still wake up at 5:00
a.m. open all of our gifts and then go
back to bed another favorite tradition
of mine is making Bentley stocking
that's like a recent tradition so this
is Bentley's fourth Christmas fourth
stalking as for apparel my favorite
holiday apparel okay I have two things
but it is my elf onesie let me just you
know show you guys what this elf onesie
looks like because holy crap it is my
favorite thing I'm probably gonna wear
it Christmas Day actually what I really
wanted to do was get a Grinch onesie and
then put a horn and a nose on Bentley
cuz
kind of looks like the dog from the
Grinch and then my second favorite
apparel for the holiday season are my
slippers I got these last year from
Victoria's Secret for like spending a
certain amount or it was like buying
pajamas or something and I got these
little red naughty and nice slippers and
these are like these have been my go-to
lately because it is the holiday season
it's the only time you can wear them
that's actually such a lie you could
wear these year-round but it only feels
right when it's morning time with a
peppermint coffee and my naughty and
nice slippers as for candles I have two
different holiday candles to share with
you guys because I couldn't choose one
of my favorites is the roasted chestnut
and Cherry's candle and like I picked
this up mostly just because the red jar
matched my living room but the smell of
this is actually so nice it kind of
smells like it kind of smells like
making sugar cookies but when you burn
this it's not super overpowering my like
all-time favorite as of last year and
this year and probably every other year
is mahogany balsam oh my god this candle
literally I know I've said this before
but it actually smells like Christmas
tree picking with Zac Efron and he's
just gonna like lift that hefty tree
above his head and you're chilling yes
that's what this candle smells like as
for activity my favorite Christmas
activity is probably Christmas shopping
and that sounds like I feel like there's
so many activities that I could choose
over Christmas shopping but Christmas
shopping without a doubt has to be my
favorite like I love going to the mall I
love when it's busy I love being in
lines I'm that crazy person that like
loves when everything's busy at
Christmas time because like you start
talking to the person in line and then I
don't know it's just everybody's like
more outside and like out there buying
things getting gifts talking to one
another and that just puts me in a
really good mood I love Christmas
shopping and like picking out things for
people and knowing that they're gonna be
super excited and going home and with
all of the gifts that you bought
everybody and wrapping them all up I do
love to shop but that is something I
feel like we already know at this point
I've already talked about this in the 12
days of Christmas already but I'm going
to talk about it again because it's me
I'm wearing it on the lips and it is
the NYX liquid suede that this thing is
life it is in the color kitten heels
it's like I'm wearing it right now if
you guys want to see what it looks like
on but honestly this liquid lipstick is
everything it goes on so smooth and so
nice and it stays on all freakin day
this is just like the balm I absolutely
love it
again I couldn't choose so I came up
with two because we have two categories
in the suite department my absolute
favorite thing at Christmas time is
chocolate chip cookies I don't know why
like I like all of the kinds of cookies
that come around Christmastime but
there's something about just the good
old chocolate chip basic cookie that is
everything I need in it it gets
everything I need in a true love and
then as for savory my absolute favorite
holiday food is stuffing I am such a
stuffing Fein like I put stuffing on the
bun and with like vegan gravy and eat
that alone I miss my purpose stuffing my
Papa used to make the best stuffing you
could ever get your hands on but your
stuffing is highly missed every holiday
season trust me
so that is it for my Christmas
obsessions this year I believe every
single obsessives like item in the
description box down below so you guys
can copy and paste it into the comment
section and let me know what you guys
are obsessed with over the holiday
season I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys all in the
next 12 days of Christmas bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
