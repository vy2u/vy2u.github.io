this over the morning guys and welcome
back to my channel for today's video i'm
actually in kingston i thought your last
night we got kids
we've got a dream of disease and
we got you down on your knees south by
life your baby still saying please
when you're down and your friend and I'm
going out last night with Maggie lights
and pools did some things she does not
wear they're so lame is looting the
night were literally carrying dye coats
and going home
I was like schools in you're usually the
line hired I want my bed I'm sorry I
want my bed to ever came yeah no
gladiator I've ever brought down
it was a Friday night and then I guess
woke up not too long ago I'm gonna go
grab myself a coffee and then I'm
thinking it might be like a fun idea to
do a vlog words like tore my hometown
with me show you guys a few things
around Kingston that are like and
buddies watching me so myself
but to work Kingston with you guys and
show you guys like where was high school
places I grew up places I've lived
things like that and then tonight a
bunch of us are going to see my dad play
so yeah it's going to be an entertaining
vlog you know grab a coffee stick around
a little while thinking of coffees
that's exactly what I need to go grab
right now because it is almost 10:00
a.m. and I am very under caffeinated
let's just
Ronde sugar-free cinnamon Dolce latte of
maple talkin about
the first stop on the Kingston tour is C
month my favorite sushi place ever you
guys have probably seen too many times
in blogs and not even known it ever stop
number two is crave is where I get my
peanut butter coffee party unreal and I
get a to medium coffee is made with your
peanut butter spirit almond belt as well
it's really like why I come home
Kingston good the peanut butter coffee
are you drinking coffee Jane just
full-on happiest dessert as we walk
through a tree I thought we
I feel like I would make good friends
with those people
gave me one Mikey please candy water
shaking to keep you off my mind
good morning guys it is now Sunday it is
now Sunday morning I am just about to
head to Starbucks to get some work done
I'm also meeting with
abraded one part to the duo of audio
they are the people that literally are
like 90% of the music and all the flight
logs I always link them down below to
talk about a trailer I want to do for
dreamcatcher fun things like that so I'm
going to do that and edit the video that
was supposed to go live last night but
as you guys saw from my blog I got a
little busy preoccupied and I don't come
to my home town very often so I didn't
put like too much pressure to try and
edit through all of those things going
on last night both my sister and I slept
on a couch and the night before I also
slept on a couch so I am pretty freakin
exhausted if you can't tell like I feel
like I look like I got hit by a truck so
I'm definitely going to need something
like heavily caffeinated beverages so
with that I'm going to head out myself a
severely large latte and fingers crossed
together
if you don't Sun monthly that's more oh
and chrome that emotion going online
next up on the Kingston tour of my
hometown welcome to my high school we're
going to go try and break it technically
my sister's high school - we never went
there together because she was a few
years older than me we're gonna go try
and break in and see if we can get in
there so I actually went to a Catholic
school called Holy Cross o bike rack's
that's new so we're going to go try and
break in here ok so far door number one
locked let's go for joy number two
if you're wondering high school was not
very fun south classics 2012 I have no
idea where it is you know what while
we're in this hallway I'm going to show
you guys my vocals class this is one of
my favorite classes that I ever had
yes it literally was a class where we
got together and we sang please check
that was my vocal teacher I loved her
this is the music room that I did vocals
in he's dead like right there because
we're all the high school dances we're
till my grade got them all canceled for
dancing on the vending machines next
stop on the tour I'm taking you guys
upstairs in case you guys need to know
about the rail so because our high
school was two floors there was railing
crew if you've been on the rail I say
that comically because it wasn't
actually cool to hang out on the rail
grade 10 read 11 grade 12 didn't really
have a grade so now we're out back of
good old Kota Krauss going to show you
guys the bleachers the the good old
football field we didn't do cheer on the
football fields but I definitely dated a
football player I feel like that would
come as a surprise Kira thinks that
these look like the greased bleachers
and they actually do the kids up alright
we're done breaking into Holy Cross to
travel in this gym class back here
that's where I used to do cheerleading
every Tuesdays and Thursdays so we'd
always come out here take water breaks
there was a payphone where we'd always
check the time to see how much longer we
had to diet cheer I mean it kind of
makes sense that they got rid of a
payphone because who uses payphones
anymore but still excited man just
joined up for junior girls locker I
wanted to show you guys like the classes
upstairs because those are really cool
my favorite classes were all the library
how did we miss melago
I never really spent much time in the
library actually I spent a lot of time
in the library and grade 12 you did your
books using a yearbook I mean that's all
there really is to see is the good old
Holocaust I hope you guys enjoyed seeing
my
probably you have a picture in front of
it insert it right about now good time
so that was our naina episode we like
grew up in that house this is where we
came all the time like a skating rink
and stuff like right in the middle of
this like cul-de-sac where I learned to
drive a bike like I'm literally in this
one with a tire pop and I flew off
Street right here
time machine here I'd like to do a lot
of things on this little
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
so I'm now back home in Toronto and let
me tell you it feels pretty good to be
home I love going to visit my hometown
and like my family and my friends and
everything but there's something about
like hitting the highway and coming in
and just seeing the CN Tower that feels
so right and it's crazy to think that
today actually marks the day that I
moved here three months ago and it
doesn't feel like I've been in Toronto
for three months but it also feels like
I've been here for a while I think it
can become super easy to lose sight of
the reasons why we do the things we do
and I think it can be so easy to set
you're like set a goal for yourself
accomplish it and then kind of be like
well now what I've got to live up to
that expectation I had of it the whole
time I think living life that way can
kind of zap all the fun out of it
you don't always have to have some sort
of high expectations for everything you
do lately I've just been feeling really
excited and inspired realizing that you
don't have to put high expectations on
yourself
you don't have to have a single idea of
what your life is supposed to look like
and when it doesn't look exactly like
that you just have to embrace it just
take all the high expectations off
yourself and just live your life and
have fun and do what feels good in the
moment so that's kind of what I've been
trying to live my life by it gives you
the nice little burst of energy you need
so really quick before I go I wanted to
ask you guys are you guys digging the
blogs I've been doing a lot more blog
style videos lately and I want to make
sure that this is stuff that you guys
want to see to it is my passion to film
these kinds of videos I always find it
really fun coming up with a theme for
each blog finding different shots and
different ways to edit it and editing
this style of video is actually what
makes me warm and tickly inside do you
guys want me to go back to doing a
balance of more vlogs and then sit down
videos where we actually sit and talk
let me know all that fun stuff down
below because I want to do some spring
cleaning even there's on my channel and
other than that I love you guys to the
moon and back I will see you guys all in
my next video there's a bonus video
coming up and it's a guys are following
my snapchat my Twitter you might already
know what it is but look forward to that
and
other than that I will see you guys all
in next week spring cleaning video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
