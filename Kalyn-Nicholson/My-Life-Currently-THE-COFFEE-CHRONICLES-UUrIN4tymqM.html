taxi oh yes hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video I'm doing the first ever coffee
chronicles which is going to be a new
series on my channel I'm sure that you
guys are probably getting sick of all
these new series or maybe not I don't
know I know that have already been
vlogging this year obviously but I want
to start vlogging every single day and
condensing them down into vlogs for you
guys so that you guys get an actual more
like legitimate peek inside my life or a
legitimate look inside my life basically
okay let me explain what the coffee
chronicles are okay the coffee
chronicles are going to be weekly vlogs
or sometimes to a week where I'm going
to be vlogging every single day from now
until I don't know when because I'm
living life on a day-by-day basis right
now condensing the vlogs into videos for
you guys and posting them as coffee
chronicles being the coffee chronicles
of my life because realistically my life
is made up of a string series of cups of
coffee there's a couple reasons why I
wanted to do this one being that I feel
and we'll get to this after towards the
end of the video when we have a life
chat but one of the reasons I really
wanted to do this was to challenge
myself to you know kind of make every
day a bit a bit more of an adventure and
I think that that was something that I
was really getting on my trips and that
I wanted to bring home with me was to
keep a sense of adventure in every
single day and to do something everyday
that is either outside of your comfort
zone or you know just to kind of make
something out of everyday and so I think
with daily vlogging I am going to have
to hold myself accountable to that so
that's partly why I want to do it and
the other reason is that I just need
some change I need some refreshening I
need some new challenges and so thus
became the coffee chronicles so this is
the first episode you might be wondering
where's the wog well I did vlog the last
couple days and this is what this is
what I got
wait wait terrifying okay what's up guys
when I have a lot of things to do and
I'm trying to do like all this stuff at
once if I don't feel inspired it's
really hard for me to be able to focus
and actually get quality work done and
lately I've been kind of missing that
spark of inspiration how did a bit for
writing Dancing with elephants and I'm
still in the process of writing that
aside from that when it came to filming
and such unless I was traveling I
haven't been as inspired to film and I
think it's because I've put too much of
like a cookie cutter stamp on the types
of videos I was trying to film I think
in opening my life up and doing more
daily vlogs it's going to force me to
open myself up more I guess to you guys
as you know the foods that I eat the
people I hang out with the things that I
do the ways that I kill time welcome to
coffee chronicles
episode one it's Friday the 11th of May
and so is starting off my daily lives
it's 9:00 a.m. I already woke up drank
some coffee and did some yoga but I
think I might make myself another cup of
coffee because I want to go for a run in
a bit and I've been taking badly running
with me so it's been super interesting
but I want to go for a little jog I'm
not sure if he's gonna come back yeah
get to life get to living I don't know
but I like fully enjoying got into this
because I'm not used to logging all the
aspects of my life but
got a few parcels here picked up the
mail my concierge I feel like I need to
bake them cookies or something because
they put a little with a lot of my stuff
in this box I'm pretty sure that you the
mugs that I ordered for my meetup which
I'm so excited about double I did little
COEs goodie bags for everyone that's
come into the stretch and snacks on here
in Toronto on the 26th if you guys like
them we can put them out on the codes
website - I'm gonna show those to you
and then I got some puzzles including my
outfit for my meetup which is in this
driver 21 box so I need scissors we're
gonna open things up I should shut this
waking up with the window open has been
so nice but in terms of filming you
cannot have your windows open when you
live in the city oh my god they're so
cute okay so these what they look like
they say yoga pants and no makeup messy
bun a cup of coffee and then on the back
they say all things codes I'm going to
the meetup gets one of these if you guys
like them we can put them out on the
coast website just let me know Vicky
they're so cute I love the color now
that I got all these okay what's next so
this stuff I see
Comfort mat foundation well thank you to
face to maybe give for this summer it's
oil free 14-hour we're oil controlling
photo-friendly
gonna have to do another through
suppression I don't think I've actually
ever filming first impressions video but
I'll have to put it in a get ready with
me part I meet up I'm wearing my chart
sweater from Hawaii some tart palates
you do have these pallets too so I might
have to throw those in the meetup pile
finally is a grand reveal so I'm not
going to show you guys everything that's
in this box because part of me
justifying this little splurge that I
did is one break up to I have a video
coming up where it's gonna be like a
full summer haul of just a bunch of
stuff that I purchased for like kind of
like boho looks and just a bunch of some
dresses but I will show you guys the
outfit I got for my Meetup I'm gonna
build like a little photo booth set my
meet up to so everyone can it's like a
stretch and talk or stretch and snacks
um I decided to go with kind of like a
yoga themes outfit so I'm gonna wear
this I think with a jean jacket it's
like a yoga gear set I was actually I'm
so shocked forever 21 has some really
cute stuff right now so these are the
leggings they match my bedding and then
this is actually a sports bra but it's
like a longer sports bra so you're not
just like sitting there with your
midriff out to the world I go on an
email notification this morning that the
shirts that are for the goody bags for
the meetups are coming too so I'm gonna
try this on
check out the other stuff that came in
that box and try it on finish getting
ready to answer some emails I forgot to
send Zoey over she's my virtual
assistant I forgot just on her her email
this morning I'm like running crazy
behind because I took yesterday off
yesterday was I just took a detox I
turned off my phone for the day aside
from ordering new beats a day where you
know you just kind of let yourself go
for the day
no it's yesterday so there's a bunch of
stuff I need to catch up on today
and I need to film a video so I'll
update you guys shortly because tonight
I'm going to get tacos and hit patio
with Larissa so maybe I'll wear one of
my new outfits I don't know Friday
Thanks
you've got a lot on your plate class
after work lately
go get rid of this and the Bermuda
Triangle downstairs take this section of
the garbage room shot let me put
something there I feel the same
in like 10 minutes even stressed out
obsessive-compulsive pulling my hair out
and bunches just try to breathe slow
make love
you are
I could just
fault
I
we both have seen better days but
somehow I still
I
the Sun continues to raise like the rent
that were pay
my feelings just come later
and a beggar
just between us that's kind of me myself
a fishbowl
[Laughter]
Oh
that was like a quick little you know 24
hours and King said Sunday we have to
head back we being this being we out of
today's video and get it up I also have
to edit tomorrow's podcast
producing so hard tomorrow packet chased
virtual being that it's the first
episode and being that I'm used to
blogging specific things but I'm not
used to daily vlogging it the first
episode but it was very interesting I
can already see where I'm gonna need to
just be a little bit more ruthless with
my camera I think that's something I'm
actually really excited about is to just
start actually vlogging outside of my
apartment because I'm so it's so funny
I'm so like extroverted and eccentric
with you guys here on camera I'm running
with people but for me to like put
myself out there and be filming myself
in public again super camera shy all of
a sudden it's so weird so I'm excited to
like push past that the perfect time to
start implementing some changes start
putting in some new challenges and to
just start living life in a new way and
that's why I want to do these vlogs with
you guys each one of them kind of has a
theme and each one of them is gonna be
basically all me resetting like hitting
the reset button on life in case you
haven't noticed this is the part where
we get into the life chat just get back
to the basics that was something that my
friend Larissa said the other night that
good sleep eat good foods do good things
and so I think that that's kind of where
I'm at right now is that I really just
want to get back to the basics hit the
reset button just take like brand new
again and I think that that's obviously
stemming a lot from going through a
breakup but it's also stemming a lot
from just the new season the nice
weather and just feeling like a
different person in general opposed to
who I was about a year ago or even six
months ago which is crazy that we're
almost halfway through the year and so
I'm gonna do exactly that I'm going to
get back to the basics
stop being so like which is why there
was no plan with me for me because when
I was traveling all of eight robit' - I
was like I started to realize that I
think I was getting a little too
structured and filling up my days so
much with work that no day was an
adventure until I traveled and so I
guess that's kind of what these coffee
chronicles are they're going to be me
finding my balance
in real time with you guys taking along
with me and kind of documenting that
adventure along the way and just the
summer and being single you know I never
really thought like I never gave myself
the true chance to full leave and worse
myself into Toronto and just immerse
myself in the city hang out with more
girlfriends just doing things just one
of two more things and I'm excited about
it now that I know from this first
episode where I went wrong or what my
struggles were ie pulling my camera up
more I'd have been up like my goal right
now is to just crush these coffee
chronicles yeah raise a glass to that
and I've kind of filled up the next few
weeks a bunch of like summer plans
hey I'm friends doing some health streak
stuff we're doing the cleanse first in
the next video it's gonna be great guys
it's gonna be so much fun we're going on
adventures we're going to Arizona the
coffee chronicles are gonna change my
life I feel it I don't excited to bring
you guys along with me that's where I'm
at
we all of this together you know in so
many ways you guys are such a pillar for
me you guys are my family we haven't
maybe seen each other's faces or I don't
know all of your names my excitement and
my zest for all of these things that I'm
trying to do solely stems from sharing
them with you and it wouldn't be the
same if I didn't have you guys to share
my life with and so thank you guys so
much for kind of sticking by me lately
including like how videos were going up
a day later for a couple couple couple
of those you know I know you guys
pretended not to notice you guys are so
nice but they want a little late being
so supportive and so loving and so nice
honestly I just I couldn't that's made
me so happy so that's it at smile I
thought date that's coffee chronicles

footage I hope you guys enjoyed today's

peek inside my life plus a life update
