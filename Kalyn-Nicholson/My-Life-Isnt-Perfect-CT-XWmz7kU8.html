sick tour of San Francisco but holy heck
I'm so tired
look we toured the whole whole place and
one day as crazy as that sounds and a
lot of the people from benefit and and
the driver and stuff they're all from
San Francisco so we were getting like
all the background stories like of all
of the places we went to like all the
history it was just so cool and I didn't
realize that there were so many freaking
like like legit girl bosses like from
San Francisco there's so many cool like
women empowering stories from here it is
kind of incredible and I'm not even
talking just like Sophia Amoruso girl

lotta sting never
good morning it is officially day two of
San Francisco well technically up in
here for three days but it's day two of
like actual things that are going on I'm
about to have for breakfast and then
we're getting some sort of tour of a
beauty central and just anyway I'm also
feeling a little under caffeinated I did
order a cappuccino to my room this
morning mind you which was when you're
wearing like a big fluffy white robe and
they show up with a cappuccino just this
morning's events were great you guys are
wondering what I'm wearing today I have
this sweater dress on it's from shope oh
I think I got it a year or two ago my
go-to black booties that you guys have
seen a million freaking times been
really cool hanging out with all of this
like there's all the girls here are
Canadian like they're all Canadian like
youtubers or social media influencers so
it's been really cool hanging out with
like so many awesome female talent and
yesterday we actually got to meet the
daughter of one of the founders of
benefit and she was so cool and we got
to find out so much history of San
Francisco so I'm excited to see what we
have in store for today that's currently
the situation I'm about to grab my bag
and head down I also went and put in an
order this morning to back order an
iPhone 8 because my phone is so mess I'm
getting like no messages
my snapchats not working with social
media won't open like I can't even open
Twitter right now so I feel so
disconnected from you guys it's really
hurting my soul so I have to wait a week
from hopefully I think today until my
new phone comes in I'm really hoping
that this phone comes in quick in the
meantime let's go grab some breakfast
and some coffee
a thousand miles is far too many hasn't
fallen koalas are
while but it seems with every step I
made was about that I was bound to take
for journey it's one of you
now sweet Hall
my home
my sweet
good morning guys we are in Napa Valley
now we just took a bus here took about
an hour and I'm freezing on the bus but
I was reading the Goblet of Fire so I
wanted to be up a little bit but today
I'm channeling my inner Betelgeuse as
you guys may have seen on like Instagram
or Twitter I posted a bunch of photos of
this outfit I handed a glass of bubbly
rose a I'm assuming and it's super good
I'm assuming will probably be very tipsy
but is it
I'm supposed to call you but don't know
what to say you know there's this girl
she wants me to take we're playing
Chopin here pizza version you did have
so have to make the best pizza you ready
so we decided to do calzone because
since it's vegan we need to pull out all
the stops to win so fingers
good morning guys so it is officially
Friday it's the last day of the trip I'm
getting picked up in about 40 minutes to
head to the airport and at home I just
got a cappuccino delivered to my room an
almond milk cappuccino it's so freakin
good and I just finished getting ready
and packing up my bag to go I downloaded
some audio books I have Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire here with me that I
might read on the trip back and then I
also downloaded how not to die which is
a highly recommended like vegan book so
I downloaded the audiobook of that the
trip has been so freaking fun it's weird
because I honestly had so much fun on
this trip and something you guys might
not know though from the vlog is that
like two out of the four days we've been
here we're super weird like anxious for
me I wasn't gonna talk about it and then
I figured I would just to let you guys
know that like take everything with a
grain of salt like you guys just watch
this whole vlog and everything is so
happy and fine and dandy and trust me it
was like I had the best time but we you
don't see a lot of the times is like the
one day when we were getting the tour
like I had the most random panic attack
out of nowhere or like last night I woke
up like beating sweat with my heart
pounding and it's just like there's
literally no reason for it physically
I'm anxious but like mentally I don't
feel anxious it's the weirdest thing
but I just thought I'd tell you guys
just because I feel like you can get
sucked into this wormhole especially on
YouTube of watching people's lives and
thinking like wow they seem like they've
got it all put together like they're
going on these ships are doing all these
crazy amazing things and like why don't
they feel anxious why don't they feel
like sad why don't they get panic
attacks why don't whatever and it's just
like not the case and it especially
sucks when it happens when you're not at
home and you're not around the people
that like you love but it's also like
one of those things that I've honestly
I'm so used to it at this point that
like I'm really good at navigating what
happens like I don't beat myself up for
it anymore
I don't ask why anymore I'm just like oh
this is just how I'm feeling and
I mean let's just work through it and
you know continue on yes we'll pack it
on in and let's head on back to Canada I
mean this trip was amazing and I want to
thank benefits so much for bringing me
aside from that it's rally let's go home
the roll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
