in a million did I think we'd be
together and knock me off my game now I
guess my mind's been change hey guys so
for today's video I'm going to be doing
a very very highly requested sorry I'm
still sick a very very highly requested
video this has probably been one of my
number one requested video since I
started doing YouTube this is more just
to give ideas for how to organize or how
I organize my makeup and also just to
fulfill the needs of those who have been
requesting this video if you're somebody
that doesn't like to watch collection
videos or if you're someone that's just
coming here to kind of write nasty
comments there is a big giant might be
kind of small on your screen X somewhere
and you can hit that and the video
magically disappears and you don't even
have to watch it I personally love
watching these videos on YouTube I love
going around and seeing how other people
organize their makeup and getting ideas
from them like I have been collecting
makeup for about 3 to 4 years now so
it's gonna seem for those of you that
don't have a lot of makeup like it's a
lot of makeup and for people that have
been collecting a lot longer than I have
or have more than I have it's not gonna
seem like that much it's kind of like I
would say in the middle alright guys so
if you've seen my apartment tour then
you already know that my makeshift
office is in our living room but that's
kind of usually what happens when I
guess you got your first apartment you
guys have to make do with the space that
you have so this is my little office
area and I'm just going to go through
basically how I store my makeup and such
now a lot of the things you're gonna see
I actually did in a DIY video but I'll
link it down below because the video
will have gone up a little while ago so
I'll start with what's beside my desk
here so off to the right here you'll see
that there is this little table down
below this basket here ask it actually
has um important papers and stuff in it
this one here has all of my nail
polishes in it so it's quite full and
then in this thing here there's just
medications like benadryl and stuff for
Ryan and I when we get sick so right
here I just have this dog it's
a little stuffed animal and it's from
Victoria's Secret it says pink and gold
and then this here it's just the one of
the DIYs that I did it is an actually a
napkin holder but I use it to put my
palettes in and basically the ones I
have up here if you guys are curious are
this one right here is the jaclyn hill
morphe palette these two are BH
Cosmetics I might have my ELF Naturals a
blush palette from Amazon my Smashbox
duo palette an elf palette here new tude
the bomb beanie palette and then just my
Sigma warm neutrals so those are all my
favorite palettes and I just put them in
the little palette holder here a friend
I just have a candle and then this is
another DIY that I did where I hot glued
a bunch of glass jars together you could
do that with candle jars as well but
basically I use it to put my mascaras
these are all my mascaras in the top
three down here are some lip liners and
then in the middle one here we just have
like little lip balms and then this is
just like lip glosses so that's a basic
overview of what's in the little glass
jar pyramids so then in this little like
mini fishbowl here I just have my
favorite nail polishes or my favorite
colors right now and right now you can
tell that they're very like neon I have
to clean this jar and I just think this
is a really cute way to display them and
it also adds a nice pop of color to like
your vanity or if you're keeping your
makeup in your bathroom behind that is
just this picture frame here and again
this was a DIY that I did with velcro so
I have a little wee hearted chapstick
that they sent me my Dior lip tint that
this one like actually goes to based on
what colored lips you have it I have
this one here which is crazy rumors
vegan banana lip chap which is actually
one of my favorite lip chaps and then my
Rimmel color rush and that one is in but
I believe cuddle me and then I have just
this big giant fishbowl here that I got
from the dollar store and I filled it
with vase filler from the dollar store
and these are just all my extra brushes
that I don't really use much so that is
a basic overview of the top of this
table here so I'll move over to my
little desk area
basically obviously this is where I do
my work on my computer and such but
right here I have more of my everyday
makeup you'll see so I've actually
organized it into this snack holders I
believe they're from I got this little
three thing from the dollar Amma or the
dollar store mapped it out as face eyes
and lips and this is like the makeup
right here and up here that I use every
single day so it's just really easy for
me to grab for what I'm sitting at the
chair so in face obviously have my
favorite face products I have some
foundations that I grab foremost and
some concealers that I grab foremost as
well obviously might help - absolute
favorite foundations in here and some of
my favorite concealers I also have my
favorite pressed powder just because
it's easier than going into the drawers
to look for them in the eyes you'll
notice that this one's a little bit more
empty because I've cleared some of this
stuff and put it up top but basically I
have my favorite Naked Urban Decay
basics palette and my mary-lou manizer
which I use everyday then just some brow
brow pencil sorry an eyeliner some Urban
Decay eye primer I'm sorry and then my
favorite gel liner and then moving on to
lips I actually have a hand sanitizer in
here that's just to clean my hands
before I start doing my makeup so don't
ask him that doesn't really go in lips
but basically I just wanted to tuck it
away somewhere so this one just has some
my favorite lip products some peaches
some reds and a dark lip stain that I
was wearing a lot this fall in winter
and then obviously my favorite like yo s
lip balm chap sticks because my lips are
always really chapped and it's the first
thing I usually do before putting on my
makeup I not I have my mirror don't mind
it it's a little bit dusty beside here
are my favorite Sigma brushes and the
ones that I use pretty much mostly so
I've got like a complexion brush my
all-time favorite kabuki brush and all
of those fun things and obviously my
all-time favorite like tapered blending
brush and then in this cute calm and
carry on
tin I actually got this it's a coffee
tin that I got from winners I'm not sure
where you'd be able to grab that but
this this blue container came with my
Sigma brushes but this one here it has
my favorite faith brush of course my
bronzer brushes my
brow brush and all those so this one has
like my more miscellaneous brushes that
are my favorite and this one has my
Sigma's that are my favorite so this was
also in my recent DIY which I have a
link down below but it's actually a
pizza pan that I have tacked up through
the holes and I spray-painted it matte
black and I'm just using little magnets
to keep some make make up up here and
then I have one of these little like
Locker cages that you get usually when
you're going to high school and you want
to put stuff in your lockers so this in
here just has my two favorite mascaras
my L'Oreal miss manga my L'Oreal
telescopic my white eyeliner and some
beauty tools so from there I'll move
over to what's on top of my drawers now
if you're wondering where these drawers
are from they're like the IKEA Alex 9
drawers which basically every beauty
youtuber has but they're just the most
practical when it comes to storing
makeup so that is what I have and I will
just show you basically what's on top so
in the back there I just have this
little makeshifts thing I did as a DIY
again I'll link it down below so on the
top here I have my jumbo eye pencils and
I just find this is a really easy way to
store them because they're easy to grab
and they're really easy to see what
color you're grabbing for then down here
I have more of like my gel just
basically more of my liquid eyeshadows
that come in those little jars and some
extra liquid eyeliners and stuff like
all of my extra liquid eyeliners are
over on this side and then in the bottom
one you'll see I have just my tweezers
for when I'm doing fake lashes my
sharpener and then my lash glue in this
mason jar here I just keep pens and
stuff because this is also technically
my desk then in this little glass jar
decided I have all of my pencil crayons
or not pencil crayons but like eye
crayons that are in pencil for I'm not
liquid form so I have a bunch of
different colors here and then I also
have some brow pencils in there and like
a couple more brow products then I have
just a little candle that I got it's
they believe in strawberry shortcake and
then I just have all of my lipsticks
here I'm not going to go through every
single one but if you're wondering what
they're being held in I actually found
the lipstick organizer from the dollar
store and I need to go pick up more
because as you can see I've got
lipsticks lined around it now and then I
have my favorites just lined up in the
front so that they're easy to grab of
course so now I will
go through basically what's in my
drawers so starting off with the top
drawer here
so this drawer is obviously my lip
drawer in the back I just have a lot of
like extra things that I don't really
grab for Lots like just little lip balms
and stuff that I've gotten in stockings
so in this container I just have all my
Annabelle twist ups which I got every
single color because they sent to me
which was super awesome
so next I have my Gerard cosmetics and
whitening lightening collection so these
are all the Gerard cosmetics right here
with the gold lids and as well as these
things here and then there's a couple
more underneath there and then also like
I said I have the whitening lightening
ones as well and then there's more
underneath here as well and the next two
that I just have these little guys right
here these are like more lip pots
obviously and then my little owl from
forever 21 and in this container here I
just have a lot of chap sticks and stuff
like lip smackers and like the stuff we
used to collect when we are nice and
young then I have my little baby lips
collection just like a bunch of
different random colors of baby lips I
don't have very many of the baby lips
though and then here I just have a bunch
of extra lip products that I don't
really have a spot for like lip tints
and lip crayons and such that I don't
really know where else to put them so I
put them there so that is my entire top
lip drawer so let's move on to the next
so the second drawer here is all of my
foundations again I am NOT very
well-organized with all of this stuff
right now foundations are one of the
hardest to organize just because they're
so bulky but I'll give you just a basic
look the only thing that's really
organizing this stuff in here is just
this one of these containers again now
in here you'll notice that these are not
foundations these are like concealers
and eyeshadow bases and notes and
primers so that's basically what's in
this little area on this square and then
the rest is all just like foundations
and such so there's no real organization
in here at all it's just kind of pretty
much thrown in there so then in the
third drawer I have just my blushes and
my pressed powders so I will do a basic
overview of how I've been organizing
these basically it's just kind of like
split in half in a ways and those are
just kind of my more
not used face pressed powders and such
so those ones the ones I don't use very
much they go back there then these ones
are just kind of random - they're just
some of my favorites just kind of thrown
up at the top and just easy to grab for
then in here this actually has some of
my favorite blushes in there and the
ones that I grabbed for the most I would
say but it gives you a nice little
overview so that is just the third
drawer then in the fourth drawer here I
have my bronzers now I am like obsessed
with bronzer if I had to pick a favorite
makeup product it would probably be
bronzers so in here I just have like all
of the bigger ones that don't fit in
this big pink thing here just kind of
thrown and then these are some like
duplicates that I have that I've just
put in these drawers like this and
stacked them because bronzer is starting
to get to the point that I need to start
stacking them so I can organize them
better and then I have some like non
powder form two bronzers right here like
this one from Stila is the one-step
bronze bronze egde and this one is a
face tint I have my all-time favorite
bronzer stocked up at the front I have
two extras plus one right here plus a
third extras down below because this is
my all-time favorite bronzer so I
stocked up on it then in the next drawer
this one is probably my favorite
organized drawer is all of my eyeshadows
like mini palettes and singular
eyeshadows so this kind of seems really
hectic but I actually made this little
box organizer and I might make one for
the other drawer tea blush and fountain
pressed powder drawer in this front
little lid portion I have just some of
my gel liners and such and some like
singular pigments and loose pigments and
then in this one I have my more singular
potted shadows so I have one from
benefit two faced a couple of like the
color tattoo use and the L'Oreal
infallible and just some basic random
ones like that and here I have like the
bigger palettes that have more than one
color but they're not like a full-out
palette so these ones just have multiple
colors in them and just all of that kind
of fun stuff like the NYX love in Paris
you guys know I've use that one a couple
times so that's pretty self-explanatory
those are all in here
and this one this one's probably more
organized this one also has those types
of palettes but these are like things I
have duplicates of so like this one here
are I don't think they sell use anymore
but the Maybelline eye studio is the NYC
like the trio from NYC that's a couple
Maybelline ones and then some singulars
from Maybelline as well so those go in
there in the back there are just like
bigger palettes like the wet and wild
ones I don't know if you guys have any
of those but they are kind of bigger and
harder to store and then underneath
those are like more of the longer or
more like rectangular shaped palettes
are in behind those and then all along
the side here is completely unorganized
but these are also loose pigments
they're just really hard to store but
yeah these are like looser things or
singular ones from like Sally's and
stuff just little dinky ones that I
don't really care to organize or don't
use that much so so then in this next
drawer I have this kind of seems a
little bit unorganized as well I'm sorry
this is very shaky and unorganized for
you guys I tried my hardest oh just on
top here I have my agenda just because
this is a really easy drawer to have
access to and it just gets my agenda off
of my desk all the time but if you're
wondering where this agenda is from I'll
link it down below I I talked about it
in a video but I actually designed this
agenda myself so I'll leave a link to
that down below if you guys are curious
and in the drawer itself I just have my
false nails and my false lashes I don't
really use a lot of false nails these
are actually just two that I have
thought in recently and so those gotta
just get stored up the front because
they're reusable and then I have just a
large bunch of false lashes and just
extra stuff here in the back there are
just some extra pallets that I don't
really use as much just like an out
little black book just like little
pallets that I barely ever ever use then
in this next drawer this one's kind of
just miscellaneous I have my makeup
wipes to wipe my face off of obviously
some moisturizer some teeth whitener
these are just like little beauty tools
and like you know clippers and my my
clean and clear spot treatment this is
just like nail polish stuff for when I'm
doing my nails some pore refiner some
brush cleaner and here again just some
random stuff for nails and a little bow
that Darrin made me
behind that is just a bunch of extra
cosmetic sponges if anyone's over and
wants to use like foundation or anything
and then I just have like little extra
tools back here to like make up tools
these are like all of my extra belly
rings and stuff and then in the back
there I have some like face masks and
just extra stuff like that we're kind of
getting away from the makeup and more
into like I don't know like tools and
stuff and here I have my makeup bag this
is like the makeup bag I use when
traveling and stuff so I just kind of
put that in there these are just like
little Beauty gloves and then those are
all of my extra brushes I have like a
couple sets of brushes down here that I
don't use makeup bag here is just full
of samples then in this little container
right here I just have like my extras
that I have like extra mascaras which is
basically all that's in here right now I
did have an eyeliner but I opened it so
these are where if I buy like a backup
or an extra I'll usually just pop it in
here or something that I'm waiting to
try for a video and then this is just
kind of random stuff like this is a hand
and foot moisturizer like just little
basic soaps and stuff like that and then
in the very last drawer this one's not
exciting at all I have my microphone for
when I'm doing videos this is what I do
my voice over fine it looks really
really funny but it's a really good
microphone it's not a dead person I
promise so my extensions are behind
there and then this is just a box from
my straightener and I just kind of kept
it in a box for my other extensions and
I kept that too so those are just two
boxes that are taking up a lot of space
so that concludes basically my makeup
storage and organization I kind of gave
you guys a little tour of my office and
such and all of the stuff that I do to
organize everything that I have I hope
this gave you guys some ideas so I hope
you guys enjoyed my makeup collection
and storage ideas let me know down below
which drawer or which thing in this
entire collection was your absolute
favorite and other than that I will see
