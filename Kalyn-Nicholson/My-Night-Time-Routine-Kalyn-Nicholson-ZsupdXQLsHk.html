lanes which it takes me
well howdy what's up guys and welcome
back to my channel for today's video I'm
doing a vlog style nighttime routine
with you guys as I'm sure you already
know from the title
today I actually just got back from the
library I was doing some work there on
clothes
just got home I was hoping to be home by
6:30 it's actually closing in on 7:00 so
I'm already like 30 minutes past my
normal night routine but it's okay
because every night is never the same
normally if I'm working at home I kind
of close things down at 6:30 and do just
like a little bit of like transition
from work mode to like home mode because
I work from home so I'm going to do that
now it usually can vary from things like
yoga to meditating to writing I think
today I'm gonna do some writing and then
make some dinner I'm freaking starving
I'm making pizzas tonight and very
excited about it but welcome really
quick if you guys aren't following me
already I'm gonna pop my Twitter my
Instagram and my blog right here blog
posts go live every Friday as well as
just in general I post a lot to my
Twitter my Instagram
Bently now wants to go outside not if
you guys want to know my nighttime
routine hashtag vlog style then just
keep watching I'm coming out coming
so lately I've been using these little
ear pods like honestly all the time when
I clean when I eat do anything late when
I just didn't use my fanny pack I also
keep my phone in my fanny pack so that
it's counting my steps and I'll either
listen to music which lately I've been
on a huge country kick it's really just
like easy listening and chill for
cooking cleaning and just in general
like country just kind of reminds me of
spring and I've just been like needing
spring but also I've been listening to
some podcasts my recent favorites have
been meditation minis I'll leave a link
to those down below but then I've also
been listening to the Oprah's super soul
conversations it's like the over podcast
it's actually so good she she interviews
a lot of really cool like inspirational
people tonight I'm making vegan pizza I
like to get all the ingredients to make
two different dinners for the week this
week it's buta bowls or pizza and
tonight I'm peeling pizza I'm gonna cook
that up listen to some Keith Urban and
some Oprah Winfrey what a duo and you
know do this thing
great gym session obviously I switched
it off of country if you couldn't tell
so now this is normally the part of the
night where you know I like relax eat my
dinner I like to watch one episode of a
show but I also only limit myself to one
episode because otherwise I would fall
into a wormhole of Netflix ever stop
watching and not get to bed on time
which was what was happening up until
the last few weeks so I limit myself to
one episode get to eat dinner relax a
little bit and then I kind of carry on
with my night so that I don't get sucked
into the wormhole of TV also another
thing I've been obsessed with lately is
soda water so right before Christmas I
got back into drinking die Pepsi which
is such a bad habit of mine and so I've
switched over to soda waters for the
last like month and I'm so obsessed with
trying new ones right now I'm drinking
the Pure Life sparkling mango peach
pineapple this is what it looks like not
sponsored just amazing so right now I'm
really into that 70 show Riverdale Wood
days it no no it's not Thursday Grey's
Anatomy and this is us I'm gonna throw
this on eat my pizza if you guys are
wondering what I put on my pizza
I put mushrooms vegan chicken garlic
cilantro onion sun-dried tomato red
pepper and yeah I think that's it
should Gregory let the episode commence
so I've been keeping track of all of my
habits ever since I made this little
habit tracker it was in of my how to
give your life a makeover video and
believe I will pop it up on the screen
or leave a link to it down below but I
just felt it at my 15-minute clean
there's still a few habits that I
haven't gotten to today but there are
things that I kind of try and
incorporate into my night routine like
doing a little bit of research doing art
filling in like the 10 K steps things
like daily goals like today I finished
everything that I needed to do in my day
planner so I can like scratch that off I
don't know why I'm so nervous thing
filling in these squares
I'm officially like found something more
satisfying than checking something off
to do this and it's literally coloring
in these squares I just want to see how
full the grid gets by the end of the two
weeks I'm such a nerd
because I'm running a bit behind tonight
it's probably only gonna be a half hour
but I kind of like to use this time to
just like do something that isn't
watching TV but it's still kind of
chilling so whether it's like sketching
something writing something that can
work on my blog if I'm feeling like it
potentially do some research I think
tonight I'm gonna do a tiny bit of
research and then I want to read my book
I've been like so obsessed with reading
lately it's been a huge part of my
morning routine down to but the one book
that I'm reading I'm like super addicted
to right now so I think I'm gonna do
just tiny bit of research on my computer
and then I don't know possibly read
you
I can't leave
I can't
you
do
Oh
I can't
without you I can't really sleep down
I can't
so after I do my like hour of whatever
whether it be research or whatever it is
I like Jacob Bentley come back inside
take off all my makeup fill out a
planner and now here we are I have an
alarm on my phone that goes off at 10:30
to make sure that I'm crawling into bed
by that time so that I can hopefully
fall asleep by 10:45 and then wake up at
6:45 so I have a few minutes to spare
actually so I'm going to read another
chapter of my book the book I was
reading earlier with sacred powers and
then this one is wanderlust and it's
it's pretty it's getting pretty good so
if I have time before about I like to
try and read a chapter I've also been
setting out my workout clothes before I
go to bed too and it's been making it
like the first thing I see when I wake
up in the morning before I can even sit
down to have my coffee on that chair is
my workout gear so I have to put it on
so I set that out and yeah I like to put
on rain sounds to fall asleep lately
because I don't know it's just been
helping get to sleep faster hey Google
play rain sounds hears the sound of rain
so with that I hope you guys enjoyed it
this little vlog style meshed with my
old style night routine I try to have to
do too many talking points and show you
guys more b-roll but also mix in the
talking parts because honestly no two
nights are ever exactly the same this is
kind of the rhythm or the combination
that I like to go through things with
but sometimes I do arts sometimes I read
more sometimes I cook a different dinner
sometimes Bentley and I will go to the
dog park every night is always a little
different but I mean this was a pretty
standard night for me
if you guys liked this video then just
give it a thumbs up or leave a comment
down below if you guys have any other
video requests and aside from that I
love you guys send me back thank you
guys so much for hanging out with me
tonight and mucking a pizza with me and
with that I will see all of you guys in
my next video bye guys hey Google Play
