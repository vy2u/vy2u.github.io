River plain it's magic Palace 7c or if
they're my mother my cat the duck face
you look like my next mistake loves a
game wanna play
I can reel that
most specifically because it's beautiful
out today um hey guys welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm doing
another vlog with you guys it's
currently Sunday so I'm hardcore jesting
and I wanted to bring you guys along
with me because I haven't filmed like a
Sunday just routine in a very long time
and I have so much to get together
there's gonna be packing there's gonna
be some live chats there's gonna be some
stuff for Bentley it's just yeah it's
gonna be great Sunday um it's actually
pretty late in the day already it's 2
p.m. I woke up this morning I was
actually in Kingston in my hometown at
for my brother's birthday party we did
it a little early since I'm leaving
tomorrow to go to Thailand which I'm
super excited about so because of that
reason I was in my hometown and I just
got back traffic was freakin nuts today
let me just say I'm really feeling I was
getting towards the end of that Drive
and flick a little you know just like so
I decided that the first thing I wanted
to do when I got home let's do some yoga
hence why I've switched into my yoga
gear and then I have to clean after do
laundry I have to cook up a mas meal
because dinner after meal prep for
Bentley because he goes to the pet
sitter as of tomorrow I have to answer
emails I have to edit a video I have to
edit a podcast I have to do a lot of
things plus it's just beautiful out it's
Earth Day today and like I know that
this isn't doing it justice but it's
freaking beautiful so I'm thinking that
I might go hang out on my patio to do
some editing guys remember it was the
spring cleaning video where we decorated
my patio and I still haven't been able
to hang out there yeah because has been
so cold so might be the first time we
get uh we get to go hang out outside
really quickly if you guys aren't
following me already be sure to check
out the links below for my socials
because I'm going to be in Thailand when
this video goes live so if you guys want
to keep track on that I'm gonna be
posting lots of instance stories and
insta pictures so definitely go check
that out down below and the new blog
post that went up on Friday I believe I
will also link that down below all the
good stuff and a Thailand playlist this
is the last leg in my beach dance
elephants trip and I have a big huge
giant amount
coming in Wednesday's video that has to
do with this beach dance elephants thing
I've been doing in April so I'm really
excited about that which is some other
stuff I need to prep for today we're
doing a lot of prep today's a lot of
prep work so feel free to grab yourself
a snack a drink stay a while and I also
need to shave my armpits I apologized
nestled on in and we'll start with some
yoga and roll into some gistic shall we
two roads diverge
sorry I could not travel Bull
be one traveler long I stood and looked
down as far as I could
where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other as just as fair
having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy yeah
though as for that the passing
warned them have to excuse of my
horrible bathroom I think it's gonna be
something that I think is gonna be like
a deal breaker for the next place I move
is that I want like a good-size bathroom
like good lighting for filming with you
guys because this I don't know we're
working with it okay so something that I
will need to do when I know that I'm
gonna be traveling and I'm kind of
trying to prep myself the day before
when I'm showering I'll know what
products I'm using and I try and put
little samples or I pack as I go from
kind of like the last shower before
leaving I already broke down on this
little notebook here that I need to pick
up a mini shampoo and conditioner and a
mini body wash I'm gonna run to the
grocery store probably tomorrow to grab
those things after that I put on lotion
before I put my robe on so I'm setting
my side my little coconut oil or just
coconut it's like a hand of body cream
it's one of the travel sized ones so
putting that aside then each step I kind
of take from here I just set aside what
I'm gonna need the travel version of or
if I'm bringing that full version and I
pack it all into this that I got I got
this off of Amazon right before
Coachella and it's just like this travel
size bag that you can roll it down and
like all your products are like easy to
grab for and then on the inside it has
like pockets and stuff like that so I
just put like the smaller things in the
center and the bigger things around the
edge and then I put like bobby pins and
elastic in here which also clips funny
enough on the outside things very
accessible so obviously I'm gonna need
my lotion I'm not gonna be able to bring
my hair care routine with me so I'm
gonna have to improvise for over a week
but that's okay this has been my
all-time favorite product I put this in
my hair every single day and I also put
a little conditioner in my hair in
general because I'm gonna throw my hair
in braids so that's more oh I can just
shake out the braids and wear waves like
on the plane and stuff so that's the
plan also praying to God I get rid of
this cold before I leave it's after I
shower I just like to spritz this all
over I even put it I don't put it too
close to the root but I get pretty high
up there because it makes my hair so
easy to comb through and when your hair
like I'm really really thick hair so it
gets tangled so easily so this is like
the only product I've found that's
cruelty free that
actually makes it easy to brush after I
shower especially like in the back but
just take this brush it's like meant for
wet hair but I start from the bottom and
I just brush up which is actually super
important if you're growing out your
hair you can't just take a brush and
just like go to town from the top that's
like so bad it's so bad from your hair I
learned every trick in the book
when it came to growing up my hair and
one of the biggest ones they say is to
use a wide tooth comb mind you I'm not
doing that but when you're brushing your
hair especially when it's wet you have
to like start from the bottom work the
knots out and then go normally no I
would wash my face but I just washed my
face in the showers so I'm just gonna go
ahead and pack my face wok and then
after washing my face I would put on
face clean so lately the face cream I've
been using is this one here it's the
Biotherm aqua gel it's actually like a
bit of a tanner like it's not it doesn't
come out tan I'll put some on my face
now but it's the color it comes out so
it's not too dark but it basically just
like naturally adds pigment to your
color as it kind of develops on your
skin that's the only way I can think of
to describe it I also have like the body
tanner it's like a mist so I'm also
gonna do this too because I hope benefit
and still from Coachella but I'm not
gonna bring my tanner with me that way
if I do get any Sun it just is kind of
like it just prolongs that little color
rather than going there and burning to a
crisp I like having a little bit of a
Sun kids look I feel like it looks cute
with clothes and like bathing suit don't
know why we haven't had this on the
whole time
you guys are truly getting me in my
Geist glory and give you guys a little
example of just kind of like how I set
up my editing station or my workstation
what I'm gonna have a bigger chunk of
work to do I find just like setting out
some pillo setting out like the stuff
that I need and then just kind of forgot
to burn a candle too and just kind of
create like a vibe for sitting down and
working especially days like today where
I have a lot of stuff to do because I
find that if I just try and sit down and
do it I get distracted super easily
versus when I create kind of like a
space even if it's just for a couple
hours and then I'm gonna put everything
away it kind of helps me get almost into
that mindset that I'm trying to get like
old like get things done so this would
also be really good if you guys have to
like study something or if there's
anything you have to work on that you're
working on from home it could even be if
you just want to stop watching like so
much TV and just section off like an
hour every day or so to work on a blog
or to work on a hobby or something I
find if you create a space and it
doesn't need to be like the most
glorious office space in the world I
have an office but to be honest I
actually prefer working out here so just
taking my coffee table like lighting up
a candle I with my glasses and the
headphones putting my bullet journal to
the side in case there's any ideas or
notes that I need to take while I'm
working and then I just like open up my
laptop and get what I need to done and
then all I do is I take my phone and I
punch out different clock works of time
to get things done so for instance the
video I have to edit it's probably gonna
take me a total of like three hours to
finish so instead of doing all three
hours right away and just sitting on my
couch I created this little space and
then I do an hour and then after an hour
I'm gonna take a break do something else
come back at it for an hour do something
else and then come back at it for an
hour and then I'll be done for the night
so welcome to my office at the knife I
currently have to edit a blog that goes
live and another video too that's going
up llama way so those are the two little
things that I need to work on really
quickly so I'm gonna punch out a quick
hour of editing and then
now as for my favorite part of the night
I'm gonna make myself some dinner it's
some things that I really like to do
especially right before I travel
anywhere is to try and make up a dish
that uses all of the stuff that's gonna
go bad in my fridge while I'm gone so I
still have quite a few I think I have
put a few veggies got some tofu use up
veggies to roast definitely gonna need
to use up these we got walked on the
potatoes here Jas I don't really need to
give all these of it addresses and we
have pita bread which is probably gonna
go bad along the way so maybe if I do a
PB&amp;amp;J later one with hummus for dinner or
like an after dinner and then make four
sandwiches tomorrow I don't know so I'm
gonna try and use up as much of this
stuff as I can that way I'm not wasting
and nothing's going bad on the way cuz
I'm gone for a week so it also makes it
nice because as soon as they at home I
get to Booker shopping and my fridge is
just like already clean and just like
prepped and ready for food so normally
Sunday's are my takeout day but because
I know I'm leaving tomorrow and I'm
probably gonna be eating like obviously
not at home for a week we're gonna get
created recipe we're about to event
right now
but I still struggle to know
be singing
yeah
do
No
glass of wine and I have like 20 pages
left we pray love so I'm gonna finish
this off really quick before I take a
nap grab some dinner and then hit the
flight because it's a red-eye flight so
I don't leave until midnight tonight I
also just chopped off Bentley I was
feeling a little weird and a little sad
after I drop off Bentley but I really
like the girl that's watching this time
and I feel like a lot more comfortable
than other times that I've left him so I
feel like hopefully things go well will
be a regular with this girl if she'll be
like his primary caretaker whenever I'm
away and still it's always a little
bittersweet dropping about in the office
before going on a trip but like an
anxious mom you know it's not about sums
up highlights to just in prepare for a
trip I ran it at a time last night to
pack because I was up editing and trying
to get some work done that was going to
go up all the way in Thailand the only
other thing that I like to do that I
didn't include in this video and it's
probably something I'm gonna do before I
hit the flight and while I eat my dinner
is just take out my journal and kind of
write down just kind of my intentions
for the trip I think I'm just going to
post what I need to post and then kind
of shut down my phone for the day and
just explore and be away from those
things there's also a big project that
I'm gonna be working on while in there
that I'm gonna tell you guys in the vlog
so and ultimately I'm just you know I'm
not gonna wear makeup I'm not gonna do
my hair I just want to let go I don't
want to meditate and do yoga and work on
this project and had nothing come back
feeling refreshed so that is my
intention of this trip and I'm gonna
basically write right a little write a
little entry to myself about that that's
that I feel like it's probably really
hard for you guys to hear me right now
and I have some pages to finish up the
Eat Pray Love before you take a nap so I
don't die on this red eyes so thank you
guys so much for just sing with me
Travel Edition any feature really than
just the style videos cuz I want to make
it just videos a full series so if you
guys have any requests for the gist
seriously we're down below I can do
baking and cleaning organizing all the
fun stuff so just let me know and I'll
see you

still so far away but for you guys it's
like three days bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
