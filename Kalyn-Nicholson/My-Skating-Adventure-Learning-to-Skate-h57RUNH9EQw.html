actually doing something that's a little
bit different than usual so I teamed up
with simple skincare and they're doing
this campaign called test the water so
they challenged me to do something that
requires me to test the water and break
free of my comfort zone and I thought
that was a really cool like concept and
I totally said yes because it fits the
whole theme of like what this whole year
is going to be for me I've just like
dedicated this year to breaking out of
my comfort zone so I thought this would
be a really fun video to share with you
guys and get you guys to test the waters
as well they challenged me to learn how
to stop on skates which is hilarious
because anyone that knows me knows that
I have never ever been able to stop on
skates I'm born and raised in Canada was
never a hockey girl and I could just
never stop I could never stop on skates
so it's always what kept me from doing
things on the ice or skating or all of
that fun stuff is that I was that girl
that's just like rammed into the boards
every time she needed to stop or worse I
would ram into a person so basically if
you want to be extremely entertained for
the next few minutes then just keep
watching
that's close
that's what you're after we'd start
creeping down
there you go there pretty much got it
so I don't know how but I did it I
learned how to stop it's only taking me
22 almost 22 years of my life
so after an hour of skating and sweating
and learning how to epically fail at
stopping i used the simple wipes to just
wipe off on my makeup and sweat and such
and it does a really really good job at
taking off all of my makeup and not to
mention that it's cruelty free which is
always an added bonus so I hope you guys
enjoyed watching me epically fail and
then totally get it I'm actually really
proud of myself cuz it's taken me almost
22 years to finally learn how to do it I
took the whole hour I mean that I'm not
so proud of but I'm just proud that I
got to do it in general so I'm going to
leave a link down below to the product
be sure to go ahead and check that out
and also I'm challenging you guys to
break free of your comfort zones and
test the water do anything that gets you
out of your comfort zone and send it to
me via Twitter Instagram or a video
whatever it is with the hashtag test the
water so I can like it retweet it and do
all that fun stuff and other than that I
will see you guys all in a future video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
