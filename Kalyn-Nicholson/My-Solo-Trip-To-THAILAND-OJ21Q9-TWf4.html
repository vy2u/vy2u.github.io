even if you'll blame me baby I cubes
only questions going down don't stop
okay hey guys what's up and welcome back
to my channel for today's video I am
doing my Thailand blog with you guys we
officially made it to the elephant
portion of my beach dance elephants
adventure let me sit properly
I know if you can't tell him through the
beautiful angelic birds chirping behind
you for this majestic doorway I'm
sitting in I'm in Thailand right now I'm
in compact also very sleep-deprived so
bear with me so I literally just got
here is been it was a long journey which
haven't for almost twenty four twenty
five hours and missed out on of Tuesday
Tuesday just didn't exist time traveled
pretty hard so I'm very very
sleep-deprived for that reason I'm
probably not gonna make too much sense
but I'm honestly in alright now I have
been wanting to come to Thailand for so
long it's one of the given number one
top places on my bucket list and one of
the biggest things that I'm doing along
here is going in seeing elephants at an
elephant sanctuary which was super
excited about but that's like us later
in the week we'll get there I already
just feels then being here and I'm in
awe I can't even I can't even form words
right now talk to some cool people like
there was this girl at my layover in
Hong Kong we were talking turns out that
she actually lived in Brampton for a
little bit which is close to Toronto she
was good to me to Thailand cuz she goes
to Bangkok all the time my driver
I haven't even fully dipped my feet in
the pool yet and this chips already
amazing I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
show you I'm gonna give you guys a
resort tour because I don't think any
words I say right now are gonna make
much sense feel like this place is gonna
speak for itself give you guys a quick
little tour and then we'll go from there
I'll update you guys don't want the
planets afterwards they think that they
left me mine and fruit oh okay let's do
this we're getting them get into work
okay so this was the door that I walked
through and then this entire place is my
villa so welcome to my little Hut this
is what you see when you first walk in
like what is this look at this oh I'm so
so gonna float on that and then there's
just this infinity pool guys look at
this view so we got some beach chairs to
lounge
so I'm definitely gonna snack on that in
a bit I'm starving this isn't even my
villa this is just like this is an extra
room but I'll show it to you guys anyway
I haven't even looked in here yet
assuming this is a bathroom okay also
houses like a little mini kitchen so
this is in here too for like teas and
coffees and stuff which is going to be
super convenient in the morning we've
got a little daybed there to the actual
villa that I'm staying in is the one
over here is the part that my stuff is
in this is like give you guys a bit of
an overview bed and then there's just
like a little chill area down here which
I would love to believe I'm gonna hang
out in maybe at nighttime if like bugs
and stuff come out but I have to feel
like I'm just gonna want to be outside
guys this pool wraps around the whole
frickin oh my god
I just like dropped all my stuff and
then this is the bathroom there's like
oh my god and this view I can't get over
it there's an outdoor shower oh my god
this place is so pretty look at these
sinks I want that even the toilet has
like a dope view crack open that bottle
of wine and make a plan
welcome to my Thailand vlog I can't
believe I'm here right now I honestly
this whole months of traveling if you
guys have been keeping to up-to-date
with the whole like three trips and the
beach dance elephants thing this whole
month has been crazy but I feel like
this whole month Thailand just kind of
seemed like an idea it didn't feel real
because it was the last trip and it was
like the furthest one the one that I
would have to travel the farthest away
for and there was so much to do like
back at home leading up to it and
everything that now that I'm actually
here it just doesn't even it just
doesn't even feel real I feel like I'm
still like I feel like I'm still
sleeping I'm gonna try and stay awake
because I feel like it's such a thing
when you travel especially overseas that
you should try and just get your body to
get used to the natural sleeping
schedule of being here so I have a few
hours to kill I feel like I'm probably
going to do some yoga
oh my god guys I can't wait to do yoga
with this frickin view you know that
question that's always like if you could
have like one last meal if
on death row what would it be for me it
would be tofu Pad Thai and spring rolls
to actually like think about getting
tofu Pad Thai and spring rolls in
Thailand
just keep the amazingness of today
rolling and just go for it between going
and seeing the Big Buddha and going to
the elephant sanctuary I don't really
have too much else planned because the
biggest part or the biggest reason I
guess that I wanted to come on this trip
was just to Zen out so I definitely want
to just kind of bask and then and
reconnect to my soul and do it with this
view hopefully tomorrow I'll be a little
bit more coherent to give you guys
better
verbal updates but I feel like I'm just
not making too much sense and I really
want to get some pad thai nice stuff
welcome to my Thailand vlog this is only
the beginning and a more tea Ostra and
let's get to it
I can't believe I'm in Thailand right
now
I was scared of dentist in the thigh and
I was scared of pretty girls and
starting conversations oh my friends are
turning green you're the magician's
assistant to the tree
they come on start later
taken away through the
I wanna be
when you're singing that song again how
can I mount them up though cuz I'm gonna
sing the words wrong this movie letter
think your life this guy decides to quit
his job and head some New York City the
sky boys running from itself and she's
been living on the highest shelf
awkward moment you go to take a nap and
you completely pass out for like four
hours
7:51 so hopefully I'm still gonna be
able to sleep tonight I just ordered
myself some dinner I'm gonna try
something else on the menu the key q2u
cutie pad see you I think I may have
said that wrong but anyways I've just
been ordering everything without me and
getting tofu instead and they've been
super nice about it that's on its way
and then I think I'm gonna hang out read
some Tarot and sit outside it's actually
cooled down so much outside that there's
a bunch of frogs outside my door that I
can hear I may go see if we can bet your
haven't find a frog do some taro maybe
get a little bit of work done and start
writing the book that I'm writing along
here and then maybe try and get to bed
by like nine or ten I actually still
feel really tired so that's a good sign
so hopefully I can just fall naturally
into the sleep schedule here and not
fall back asleep for another four hour
now to make up the meantime let's go see
if we can find a frog also about a
thunderstorm which is oh yeah it's
thunderstorm angle Frankie okay you
better come up for my vlog before I
leave here
nope he's gone it's actually about two
thunderstorm - there was like the
loudest crack of thunder turnoff like
all the lights open that up like this
opens wide open and I just see like yoga
and the dark wood that'd be kind of
creepy I don't know I think it'd be kind
of cool and I want food I heard the song
again
there he is little froggy I'm a little
guy they know it's raining
if you had wings just like a bird and
you could fly
guys let's go put my dinner away in the
kitchen and I found the whole freaking
family's guys I need to get in there
Tubbs and worse
hills and curves okay
yeah pretty friends they're welcome to
say honestly I'm kind of in their
territory so good morning from day one
flash - in Thailand I mean yesterday was
kind of like a full day because I got
here earlier in the day so I woke up not
too long ago went through my yoga flow
this meditation had my breakfast come
which was amazing even that past so that
I got last night where I switched out
the meat for tofu it was on I think it
may be even better than the pad size
this morning I have a bit of an
itinerary I kind of wrote out a bit of a
plan for today just to make sure that
I'm like you know making the most out of
it but also telling myself that they
didn't have to stick to it this
afternoon that I think I'm going to go
head out and see the Big Buddha it's
about 40 minutes from this place which
if you guys are curious a lot of you've
been asking questions on Instagram and
stuff I'll link where I'm staying down
below but first things first
there you go for another swim and then
tomorrow I actually go to a different
resort which is gonna be cool I wanted
to try out a few different places as
well as here in the short time that I am
anyway
moving at a comfortable pace said you
wanted right yeah you doing right but I
still feel like we're in the same place
are we doing it right are we doing it
right you know everyone has
- since everyone has
idea of what they think is right but
do
everyone is supportive of this so I
ready to fight are you ready to fight
cuz I know when we succeed the ceiling a
new light see the new light
everyone has her own beliefs everyone
has war in peace I hope you know what
you got into cuz ready to fight
or morning swim so I'm just about to eat
my breakfast and then I'm going to pack
up my stuff I have a couple hours I have
wait yes over the two and half hours
before I head to the next resort that
I'm staying at and then just like chill
in the Sun and get some work done and
just like bask in this villa for the
last little bit I can catch it on camera
because he ran away so quickly but I
woke up to a monkey
on the edge of the pool that I was like
just filming just before this I think
like the over on the other side of the
infinity pool and then this morning I
could see them like off in the distance
and forests I don't know the next place
I'm staying I think I might see if they
can upgrade me to an ocean view because
I didn't think I would need it but after
staying here I feel like so incredibly
spoiled by having that kind of view that
I want to see if I can get a place where
I can see more monkeys so there's that
and then tomorrow I'm going to see the
elephants which I just made a
reservation for a drive transport to go
Bon Appetit
and no dirty business
together
where are we
you know so it was number two so I'm
gonna give you guys a quick little tour
in a second what you're seeing behind me
is just a slight portion of the
incredibleness that is this place I'm
actually I'm really happy that I decided
to do two different villas or two
different resorts only because of the
resort that I was just in as you guys
saw was absolutely incredible like
tucked away in the jungle there was
monkeys in my pool in the morning like
honestly it was such a little like tuck
away oasis but the only thing about it
is that there was nothing around it like
there was nothing I could just go out
and walk to whereas this place that I'm
in now it is also super beautiful but it
is right in the smack dab middle of like
so much stuff there's stores there's
shops there's markets the beach is like
not kidding you if I walk out of my
Villa and just like go around the corner
I'm at the beach feel like that one was
perfect to start with because it was
like pulling myself out of the city
dropping myself into the jungle and kind
of just you know breathing and relaxing
and now I'm gonna get to explore for the
next few days and also I asked about the
ocean view and they didn't have it for
the first two nights but for the very
last night they did we feel like I kind
of like that I like that it ended up
being the last night that I get to have
a little ocean view and then I go back
home so because I know this vlog is
already so long and I filled so money
and memory cards with footage I'm gonna
go ahead and give you guys a quick tour
and then let's get on with the day I'm
thinking we should maybe hit the beach I
say we as if you're here but in a way
you kind of are I check out the shops
and stuff around here and just like
explore today there's a bunch of bars
and pools and restaurants here and the
girl at the front she was so follow so
the people that work at this one and the
last one everybody in Thailand is just
so nice but the girl she was like like
obviously they think they think I'm here
with a lover I wrote on TripAdvisor that
a lot of people just travel solo to
Thailand but every resort worker that
I've met has been like unknown anyway
I'm gonna give you guys a tour of this
place I'm rambling I'm rambling because
I've had a lot of coffee so let's just
let's get to the tour
oh my god okay so this is where I walked
in and there's like a little you know
front 48 which is really cute and then
should I go left or should I go right
this is left let's go right we'll circle
all the way through so you walk through
and this is like the main room of the
villa over here is just a desk with all
of the like room service and all that
stuff anything you basically need to
know the bed which I'm digging this
headboard so hard and like I said they
thought that I was honeymooning in
Thailand but I'm not and then this way
this is my little pool I've got just
surrounded by plants so and then we'll
get to that in a second but there's a
doorway there to the outside like
balcony guys this is my favorite part
are you ready for this look at this
bathroom this tub is oh my god I don't
even know how to explain this place my
brain is malfunctioning why should such
thing as a set can because they have
like it's like a Roma therapy thing
going on in here and it smells and then
these little sinks like look at how cute
these are what the hell floor even the
floor is beautiful and then I'll show
you guys out here so this is my balcony
my shirt totally matches those pillows
and it looks out to my lovely low pool
so that is a tour of this place so with
that it's like 12:30 I think maybe it's
still midday basically so I think I'm
gonna throw my bathing suit walk down by
the beach check out the restaurants
check out what there is to see no I've
already been talking a lot but I'm
feeling I'm feeling some type of way
right now so allow me to keep going I
had so many mixed feelings going into
this trip a little worried and anxious
because I was going to somewhere
completely new I wasn't sure how safe it
was everything that's kind of going on
and everything that's happening and what
it all means it's just making me really
recenter my focus and kind of direct
myself with life I guess and so when I
say that I can feel this trip working
some kind of magic
I think it's slowly but surely putting
down the flooring underneath me
feels good it feels it's very it's a
comforting feeling I'm gonna change to
my bathing suit and go to the butcher
shall we darling let's go we were
staying in Paris away from your parents
and I thought wow if I could take this
in a shop right now I don't think that
we can work this out on a terrace I
don't know if it's fair but I thought
how could I let you fall by yourself
well I'm wasted with someone now you
we go down
I was
everything
let's show them we are better
to get away from your parents and we're
so proud standing that way
cigarette posing pictures of yourself
behind the Tigers
into the arrow a small town on our own
living eating junk on
we go down together they'll say you
could do anything they'll say that I was
clever good morning and welcome to day
four or five I don't even know what day
is this anymore but I am on a freaking
high right now I'm so excited I'm about
to change out of my bathing suit and
into my outfit for my date with the
elephants the guys it's officially
happening I can knock this off my bucket
list
I have no idea how we react but
oh my gosh you are a beast
hello there what what did that just
happen oh they were so cute guys oh my
god I love elephants
we're like giant Bentley but today it
was so much fun I'm exhausted I'm so
tired
part of me just wants to like order in
some room service and just be a
vegetable and go to sleep early tonight
yep that's what we're doing comfy
clothes be right back I had it I mean
everything everything else that happens
on this trip at this point is icing on
the freaking cake because I got to see
the elephants the place I went was the
Phuket up and sanctuary which I'll leave
a link to down below it is the first
sanctuary and Poquette that's what they
were saying where the animals can go and
they live like a super happy life they
created that sanctuary for those animals
and they take animals and they let them
live out the rest of their lives in a
happier place and feed them and they
have freedom and they get to like bathe
and play and it was just like oh it was
just such a comforting warming place to
be I mean you can't tell I'm in cloud
nine right now that was a big bucket
list item guys
if you had wings just like a bird and
you could fly
where'd you go
would you come and fly
hills and cars okay
we are the last day it's really bright
by the way so I'm squinting during this
outro so I have a few more hours before
my pickup for the airport so I'm
actually going down to get a massage
I think first I want to get like my last
Pad Thai meal you know before I go home
and then after my massage I get picked
up and I'm going to the airport to head
home I think it's like 24 25 hours of
traveling before I get back to Toronto
I'm like I'm gonna miss this view or be
serious right now
in that side I also feel like I got kind
of what I needed from Thailand after
petting the elephants that was like all
I really needed I explored a little bit
I went and grabbed dinner last night and
I got my green curry in which was really
good and I finished reading the power of
now I finished reading that at dinner
actually and I hung out at the beach I
did some Tarot last night and my tarot
reading was like super on point which is
again that I feel like that's been
happening the whole trip I got I'm not
gonna lie this morning actually I had a
moment I had a moment this morning where
I was like super frustrated because I
was trying to film and I couldn't get
the lighting right and then I tried to
go outside and it was too loud but I did
some yoga I showered and I feel better
the way I felt coming into this trip is
so much different than the way I feel
leaving it and even though I'm still
like you know the same person I feel
ready to go home I feel ready to just
get some get my stuff together like I'm
taking the month of May to just get my
taxes done and get figure out like my
whole life situation I just I feel good
I can't believe it's already past and
gone and all three trips are done I've
been looking into some other possible
places to go at the beginning of June
and I'm thinking of maybe heading up
Arizona with Bentley but we'll see you
know day by day hour by hour that's how
I'm trying to live my life so keep
watched because I'm going to be working
on the book that's coming all about this
month and it's a big if you guys are
curious what the books about obviously
it's about the three trips a little
personal journey of the soul if you know
