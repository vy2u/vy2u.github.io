room to film at the stretch and talk and
to be honest I was kind of feeling this
way before I left every time I got back
from a trip I always just want to like
change things up and get new energies
going it was starting to stretch and
talk by changing up the phone
you see
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I am
filming the stretching talks that I was
supposed to film in Thailand but ran
into a few complications here you can't
hear me you can't see me the way I was
picturing it which was like this you can
literally not see me and my Wi-Fi is not
working the video keeps doing this it
just like I can't I can't leave it on
this note I guess you just gotta accept
what is and I ended up being a kind of a
good thing is I got inspired to change
up my office space slash yoga room and I
absolutely like it I feel like this is
gonna be nice now for filming in front
of for like yoga and just in general we
got ivory back there Marley for instance
it's about it's about really quick
before I start I just realize that I
kind of want a coffee and maybe some
blueberries so let me just there yeah
good how decadent this looks right now
like does it get much better than this
also Cheers and if you're gonna be
stretching with me let me know I'm gonna
try and make this one easier to follow a
lot of you guys have been asking me to
do like yoga video and it's something
that I really want to do but I'm just
like you don't want to you don't want to
pretend that you're an expert at
something that you're still kind of
waiting but so bigger so these ones I'll
keep it to the basics so that when
they're easy to follow into I'll slowly
be building up my ability like
constructed I guess and maybe it'll just
kind of happen on its own you know so
for today's stretch of talk I'm going to
be answering the questions I posted a
tweet to Twitter leave my Twitter down
below if you guys aren't already
following from there we're just gonna go
from the top I'm just gonna pick them at
random I'll answer the first time we'll
begin stretching and then we'll just
we'll just kind of roll it out from
there especially me taking many coffee
sips so without burning any more of your
guys time I guess we should just jump
right in so the first question is from
Brianne
and she wants to know what do you use to
find your yoga poses is it in your head
Google search it an app I want to get
into yoga but I'm not sure where to
start that does yoga classes for a few
years I've done them sporadically here
and there and I tell myself that I try
and go to hot yoga once a week but
lately that hasn't been the case since
I've been travelling and such but that's
not a lot of the poses that I know kind
of came from going to classes and then
slowly I just started doing it on my own
and I find that if I put on the right
music and I just trying to miss my body
it kind of forces you to stop thinking
and just like feel how your body feels
you can intuitively tell where your body
needs to like have some focus if that
makes sense
um for instance when I got home
yesterday I got back from Thailand and
after I was home I decided to throw on
some tunes and do some yoga and I had
been flying for 22 hours almost and so I
could feel like how tight my shoulders
were and just even my legs were kind of
sore from being extending around for so
long as I started to stretch I could
feel my body just like wanting to do
that as I pull when I'm like ooh you
know what I also feel good is if I sleep
to this down and did this next and then
slowly you just kind of start to follow
your body rather than follow your brain
so that's kind of how I do my yoga flow
and then in terms of learning new poses
there's a couple I'll leave some links
down below to some Instagram accounts
but there's a couple like yoga
inspiration accounts where I see them
doing poses I like to flow into like a
rhythm then give myself a bit of like
play time during the yoga where I try
new poses and do new things and then I
kind of line back down that's my overall
yoga routine so as when did John wants
to know who is the Kalyan Mickelson for
you as you are to us and where do you
get your support if that makes any sense
I'd say my top three people right now
would be elizabeth gilbert at car toll
who wrote the power of now I have to
reread that book because so much of it I
was like holy crap as he woke also David
G he's another person that he wrote
sacred powers and when I went to go
follow him as creepy movie follows and
he also calls Bentley on Instagram so
shout-out to David G he's a
sacred powers is also a book that
changed my life the people that I kind
of go to when I'm having a moment and
I'm just like I'm not feeling myself
right now or I just need some motivation
or I need to just feel better I'll think
like what would let's Gilbert do or I'm
like what would do Yugi tell me or what
would that part tole think about this
three people have kind of been like my
inspiration lately
so dad wants to know what is the best
part to travel alone and what is the
best thing you did in your travel I feel
like the best part about traveling alone
is that you kind of get to go in your
own schedule I feel like but I get to
look up vegan foods and try a bunch of
vegan food so that like having to
convince somebody to go to a vegan
restaurant which although I'm kind of
lucky most of the people that I do
travel with love vegan foods I had I may
get to go your own space and go at your
own schedule and then also - I find that
when traveling alone you can I don't
know it's very it's very therapeutic in
the sense that you get a good sense of
where your brain is at check kind of
check in with yourself check in his life
and the best thing you did in your
travel the best thing I think they did
especially for Thailand was pet
elephants I think that that was by far
my favorite part of my trip solely
because elephants are my favorite animal
and it's something that's been on my
bucket list are so long and it was just
so very humbling to be in the presence
of something so big but something so
peaceful and elegant like they're so
happy and they're just so cute and the
elephants they had gone through such
horrible conditions before they had been
abused and even after all of that still
so sweet and gentle and you can tell
that they just love like they just want
to make you happy you're so pretty cute
and they eat melons like they were
grapes so Shelby wants to know how do
you become an early riser this isn't
gonna be a good question answer right
now because I'm trying to get back into
a good sleep schedule now that I'm home
so the month of May it is my goal like
May is gonna be is just month I want to
get my taxes done I want to get back
with his sleep schedule I want to
officially build
me back into running and just so many
things and so I feel like when it comes
to getting back into being an early
riser you have to pick a bedtime and a
wake-up time reading this book called
calm and in it it talks about how we
need ideally around seven hours although
all of our bodies are a little bit
different but I find even for me I do
thrive off of about seven hours of sleep
anymore I feel a little groggy or two
like and any less I am like when I don't
sleep I can't function when I don't
sleep I had to bed around 11:00 and
11:30 s when I start getting ready for
bed and hit the hay and then my alarm
goes off at 6:30 and I just want to
stick to that schedule and I think that
when you get your body into like a habit
of waking up early it gets easier and
easier that said if you're not already
waking up early I suggest going
backwards 15 minutes every day for like
two weeks until you get to the release
point that you want to give your body
time to get accustomed to it rather than
just trying to go cold turkey you start
waking up super early because your
body's gonna be super confused gonna be
so tired you're just gonna want to sleep
in the next day and the next day and
then you'll fall back out of that rhythm
if you're waking up at like 9:00 a.m.
right now then wake up at 8:45 tomorrow
and just make sure you're getting enough
sleep but make sure you're going to bed
earlier if you're trying to wake up
earlier you guys must be something at
Sandy I never used to be able to touch
my toes let's let's do it go where we're
at right now that will do rubber
supports up oh not bad not bad but I
never used to be able to touch my toes
that was insane is this I used to be
like this and my tailbone would hurt
because I like that's how tight my
muscles used to be no I'm like a goal is
to be able to like completely flatten
into my legs but we're not there yet so
Madeleine wants to know how has yoga and
meditation changed you as a person hope
you're having an amazing time in
Thailand
umm how was yoga Jane transpersonal boom
in meditation has changed me a lot in
the sense of being able to understand my
brain more I feel like before I was
going so fast all the time and just
always focused on what was happening
next like I couldn't really tell where
my brain was at and I have all these
emotions but I wouldn't understand them
because I wasn't presently aware of what
my brain was kind of
doing this is us this is really funny
that is what like what is going on I
don't know it's a very different way to
film right now being able to kind of
check in more now with my brain and just
check in with my body and check in with
my emotions at the present moment has
made me more aware of my thought
patterns it's made me more aware of the
ways that I tend to deal with things or
even just things that I was kind of
doing the way I was thinking and how it
would create a mindset for me that I
would be then kind of actively living
out throughout the day without realizing
it and so when I do yoga in the morning
it's like okay where's my brain at and
then I kind of like my sleep clean and
set a new feeling and just like a new
energy through the day which in turn has
made me more present throughout the day
because that I am like actively more
aware of my surroundings and I'm also
just happier I guess or even when things
aren't going great and obviously going
through a breakup is enough awesome and
there were times well on my trip like
something would happen and it would kind
of throw me off like I almost missed one
of my flights and I was like rushing and
then I have to just like kind of you get
that chance to be more kind of presently
aware of yourself and the way you see
and think things like your perspective
on things and to set a new perspective
some level up you know let's do some
standing poses okay so the next question
is Amanda asks wants to know could you
talk more about your spirituality in
your connection with the universe and
more about your visions etc and how you
stay connected with the loving forces
that flow within and without without
losing yourself in the world I struggle
with this on a daily basis and would
love your advice I lose myself all the
time and would like to be more
disciplined and letting things go and
having peace of mind holy crap girl okay
yes I feel this so let me start with the
first part could you talk more about
your spirituality in your connection
with universe and more about your
visions let me begin by saying I do
still lose myself in the world
I still get into bad mindsets I still I
still have moments where I feel myself
fall out of the flow I get super
frustrated by something
miniscule or I find myself kind of
brooding and some negative thoughts and
feeling kind of sorry for myself had
that happen to me this morning no it's
having a moment like that so kind of let
go of that thought or that assumption
that anyone can just constantly state
disciplines and constantly be in that
kind of mindset all of us fall out of it
we're trying to retrack and retrain
years and years of just like ingrained
habitual thoughts and so one I feel like
having that connotation around it and
telling yourself that you're not going
to be good enough until you're
constantly in that mindset is one of the
things that's pulling you out of that
mindset of human and we have to accept
that our brains sometimes just work the
way they do we stop judging yourself for
it and a lot of the times we fall out of
those healthier positive mindsets and
it's more negative ones those challenges
end up building us into stronger people
because every time you fight to get back
to the other side I think that we get
better at doing it but we also
appreciate life more and we appreciate
people more and we appreciate the
positive things in our life more because
we've worked so hard to focus on them to
focus on having more fun with it and
understanding that like here in a bad
mood just accept that you're in a bad
mood don't judge that you're in that bad
mood and then just say well you have to
say to make yourself feel better the way
you would if you were to be doing it for
somebody else kind of thing you know I
can't fully decide I've been working on
so let's see how this goes almost we'll
try it with joy at the end of the video
the other thing that I've been learning
is this one so I like to take a yoga
strong this one's from Lululemon and I
stick my foot in it put it up straight
and then pull it around until and you
can kind of like work your way up the
strap until you get closer and closer to
put until you get closer to your foot
whatever you do to one side you kind of
have to do to the other
balance the yin-yang you know it's next
question Chris wants to know do you like
Thailand or Hawaii better and what's
your favorite veggies I only tell them
to why you're like
they were both me I know I might have to
say Hawaii only because like Ohana
and it's just I love that they have like
words for sky and the mountains were
named after like the fact that they
thought the Sun lived in the mountain it
was just like there's so many legends
and tales so I'd have to say Hawaii for
that reason but I loved Thailand and I
loved the spring girls in Thailand and I
could live off spring rolls in Thailand
for the rest of my life so you're then
asked for my favorite vegetable um
probably either portobello mushroom or
butternut squash zucchini or red pepper
and onion you guys I'm good when you're
eating any of those things you know back
down or shall we Lindsay wants to know
wherever your next adventure be and
right now I'm kind of looking into
potentially heading to either Arizona or
New York I want to do another puppy
adventure because it was just so much
fun I've been really really wanting to
travel but the thing that always holds
me back from traveling is I hate being
away from Bentley but something about
stepping one of these shows here but
when you get a dog you don't think that
it's like one of those things it's like
having a kid you don't just like pass it
off so you can go run off and like
travel the world so looking at it this
way like okay I really want to travel I
remember early 20s I'm not tied down and
I might as well go travel but I have a
dog so why not kind of see that as the
universe meant for me to have Bentley
obviously our souls are deeply
intertwined so maybe I'm just supposed
to take my puppy with me on these
adventures and let Bentley live a very
you know fulfilling life I figure two it
can help with creating content out of
that like sharing with you guys the
puppy adventures sharing with you guys
like the tips and tricks that I learn
when it comes to traveling with the dog
because I'm a newbie at it we're either
gonna do Arizona and go like hiking and
meditate or New York and go sightseeing
and if I did in New York I think I'm
gonna tattoo there's this tattoo artist
in New York that I really want to go see
I wanna shout which one we're on new
velour
so as Moe says your trip looks amazing
my question is wire elephant your spirit
animal and how did you delete it how did
you learn / decide with your spirit
animal plus an animal that you feel
connected to in any way it can be your
spirit animal I don't think anyone can
tell you who you can not have as your
spirit animal but I've always loved
elephants I love elephants sea turtles
and dogs I want to say that those are
like my favorite animals but when you
look up the symbols of the elephant -
like what an actual elephants like
meaning is and there's spirit animal
like definition Authority awareness
confidence family love patience pride
stamina strength dream time and dream
work will an intense environmental
protection and guardianship those are
really huge virtues values and morals
that I feel like I want in my life and
those are the things that I want to
align my life with and resonate with
especially even just little things like
me like taking care of the environment
like that's part of it there's symbolic
meaning when it comes to being the
spirit animal and family love being
authoritative being like going after
things dream work dream time but also
like being gentle and patient kind and
so but I kind of read that that was what
the symbolic meaning of an elephant was
and chose it because they want to be
those things if you look up any of the
meanings of all the animal pick one that
you know aligns with the things that you
want to be in life otherwise the type of
person or the types of values that you
want to have in life and then there you
go you chose your spirit animal dogs are
let's find out John our adventure
constancy curiosity devotion friendship
loyalty protection patience
vocalizing truths unconditional love and
hearing beyond the veil dogs are good to
those finish these off with a couple
stealing poses and then be on our way
Sonia wants to know what makes you feel
happiest and I think that's changes
every day but one of the things that I
recently discovered is like such it's
like the number one thing I'll do if I'm
in a bad mood or if I'm starting to get
to in my head sometimes even
I just wake up and I'm in a weird mood
and I'm like doing my makeup or I'm like
you know getting ready for the day and
I'm just I'm starting to go through my
tasks and already I feel like this like
heavy gray cloud over my head where just
like I can tell that my mood it's just
everything I'm thinking is super
negative might go to thing to do that
makes me instantly just become present
and happy is to have a dance party like
I've discovered dancing makes me so
freakin happy you kind of let the music
take your body you know and I feel like
it pulls you out of your head and it
just pulls you into the present moment
you're dancing to like an upbeat happy
song and it's just like it possible to
not feel happy after doing that so
that's one thing that definitely makes
me really happy okay they answer two
more questions and then we'll wrap up
this stretch it says how would you
describe yourself in three words Oh
weird but eccentric eccentric would be
one word I feel like I'm very one time
in my body like once a minute good would
have been a good place when I'm feeling
100% myself I'm very like I dance or
sing when there's no music around weird
keeps coming up but I just feel like I'm
a little goofy I guess passionate I find
that I'm a very passionate person when I
decided that something is important to
me it is like a roller coaster of just
pure passion I can go really really high
with my emotions and I can feel really
low with my emotions but I feel like it
comes from I'm just feeling so deeply
about things kind of like head in the
clouds a little bit head and clouds
dreamy oh it's a good word for that I
like space almost feel like my head is
constantly in the clouds and it's my
class that too but I feel like I get a
little lost in like dream worlds and can
be a pro and it can be a con a lot of
the times it's hard for me to anchor my
feet down to the ground and get more
like annoying tasks done like doing my
taxes but it's also pro because I feel
like those dream worlds bowls out ideas
for things like dream catcher or just
like video ideas and
it's a prolific um you know and the last
final question I'm going to answer is
buy back leave a client and she wants to
know
now they got expensive elephant what's
the next big thing on your bucket list
and I actually just recently updated my
bucket list so the next few things that
I popped in there in terms of doing it
by time like what I want to do
physically next I guess publish a book
which is something that I recently told
you guys about dream catcher is going to
be coming out on July 13th how little
feels I guess I technically published
but this is gonna be a physical book
that you can hold on to and read and put
in your purse or your bag and feel like
that's going to be the biggest next
thing on my bucket list but I added some
new ones if you guys don't know well
there was a Thailand I thought of a few
new things that I want to do before I
kick the bucket in this life and I want
to build a tree house press a flower and
then I am in the Arizona meditation hike
trip and getting a tattoo in New York so
those those are the few things I added
to my bucket list and then in terms of
next dreamcatcher publishing
dreamcatcher is definitely the next big
thing that I really want to do this year
so there you guys have it I hope you
guys enjoyed today's a stretch and talk
I tried to make it a little bit easier
to stretch along with me but if you guys
have any you know feedback requests
anything like that pop it down below
