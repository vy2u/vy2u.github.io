be sharing with you guys my spring
foundation routine along with five
different spring essentials or spring
must-haves
so I've completely changed up my
foundation routine from the winter to
the spring because I wanted something
that was a little bit more dewy and
something that made me look a little bit
more glowy so that is the little routine
that I'm gonna be sharing with you guys
because it took me a little while to get
it down pat or to find the right kind of
routine that I wanted for like the glow
I was looking for if you guys haven't
noticed I've been doing more like
smaller giveaways in more videos so just
let me know if that's something you guys
like if you guys are enjoying having
more chances of winning things by doing
smaller giveaways then I can keep doing
that or if you guys would rather me just
kind of pull all the money together and
spend it in one big giant giveaway I
could do that too I just figured doing
giveaways that were a bit smaller and
more often gives you guys more chances
to win and that way I'm able to send
more things out to more of you rather
than just a select few of you so in this
giveaway I'm going to be sending you my
foundation routine but I'll be waiting
to pick up the items after I pick the
winner because I am going to have to
choose the right colors for your skin so
that said if you guys want to enter this
giveaway then just write one of your
spring essentials or your spring
must-haves down below and you will be
entered I'm just doing this one on
youtube so all of you guys have a chance
to win it so just write one of your own
spring must-haves or one of your own
spring essentials down below and I will
be choosing the winner at random so for
all of the rules just go ahead and check
out down below and other than that just
keep watching to find out my spring
foundation routine along with some of my
own spring essentials
so lately I've been starting out with my
Olay fresh effects swirled modifier to
get rid of any redness and reduce any
signs of pores so I'll start out with
that as my face and then over top I've
been putting up my covergirl trublend
which is my new favorite foundation
because it gives the perfect amount of
glow and it's a buildable coverage so I
just really love the color of this and
the coverage of it as well
and as for concealer I've been using my
next full coverage pot concealer because
I find it just gets rid of my dark
circles as well as does a perfect job at
highlighting bright where I need it so
again with this giveaway you'll be
getting all of the products on I'm
listing right now but you'll be getting
them in your own colors and then I just
use a small elf stippling brush to
stipple it and blend it all into place
see
so my absolute favorite is press powder
is my two-faced primed and poreless but
there is a dupe that I use which is my
Rimmel stay matte translucent powder and
I just apply this with a big giant
fluffy brush that I got from Claire's so
as for bronzer my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil is my favorite but again the NYX
matte bronzer will do the trick if
you're looking for a cheaper dupe and
then I just apply this as a contour on
my cheekbones along my hairline on my
jaw line and as well as my nose
so for blush my recent favorite has been
my NYC Prospect Park rose and I just
apply this with my Sigma blush brush and
I apply it right on the apples of my
cheeks and then blend it towards the
back of it to give it a bit more of a
natural look
and then that's pretty much the base for
my average spring foundation routine and
I will just then continue on with the
rest of my makeup so as for some of my
spring essentials the first one would be
sunglasses and I like all different
types of shapes and colors and sizes of
sunglasses so this is definitely a
essential of mine
and if you follow me on snapchat or
Instagram you'll know that I've recently
found a new obsession with iced coffee
and I've been making them at home so if
you guys want the recipe I'll put the
recipe to this or the instructions on
how to make this on my blog but lately
I've just been obsessed with iced coffee
and I'll put it in one of my little
mason jars and then just drink it out of
there and then of course my next
obsession or essential for Spring has
been kimonos I've been getting all
different types of kimonos collars
prints and everything and I just find
they're perfect for spring because it's
not a coat but it's still a little bit
warmer than just going out in a wrapper
and my next essential is also an
obsession of mine and it's pineapple
which many of you guys already know I
always have pineapple in my apartment to
eat or munch on because it is my
favorite treat and snack and very
refreshing for spring and of course who
can have spring without a good spring
playlist I like to put together a little
playlist for the springtime and I'll
leave mine down below for you guys and
then I can dance around my apartment
with Bentley which is pretty much what
my life consists of so thank you guys
for watching this a spring foundation
routine along with my spring essentials
or spring must-haves be sure to let me
know what your guys's spring essentials
are down below to enter the giveaway and
I'll see you guys all in a future video
