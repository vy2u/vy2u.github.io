I'm going to be pressing in at my
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I
like to use full coverage even in the
summertime and then going to be
hydrating my eyes with elfs
eye primer and then going over that with
a clean dark circle eraser to get rid of
my dark circles I'm also going to be
using this to highlight my face and then
I'm going ahead and blending it in with
my fingers I'm then using L'Oreal True
Match mineral powder to set everything
in place because it's nice and light for
the summer time it doesn't feel too
cakey then of course I'm using my brow
bar to go by whitening might need to
fill in my brows and I just like to fill
them in with the darker color even
though my hair is blonde
I just find it matches my root color a
bit more
then I only miss Sigma's eyeshadow base
since I will be kind of sweaty and hot
in the summertime if this keeps my
eyeshadow in place and make sure it
doesn't go anywhere so I put this all
over the lids and then I'm using my wet
and wild palette in comfort zone I like
to use the one side of it that has all
these warm colors I've got the eyelid
color obviously all on the eyelid
then I'll put the highlight color in the
inner tear-duct and that's pretty much
it I'm gonna go ahead and curl my
eyelashes and skip eyeliner since this
is a summer my everyday summer look
I feel like eyeliner can be too heavy so
I'm using Maybelline falsies mascara and
just doing a couple coats of it so to
contour my face I'm using rimmel rimmel
Snatcher bronzer and then for blush I'm
using NYC's mosaic blush and I'm just
using a brush to just kind of curve out
my cheekbones and put on my blush
and some names when I'm putting on a
little bit more makeup I'll sculpt out
my nose with bronzer as well
and to give myself that beachy glow and
using mary-lou manizer and just putting
this as a highlight on top of my
cheekbones for lips I'm using my
Annabelle twist up in absolute and gos
honeysuckle but fall underneath it just
to keep my lips nice and moisturized and
then of course putting to be a neutral
of color on top of the lips
so that's all there is to my everyday
summer makeup routine I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys all in the
future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
