my channel for today's video I am doing
the ever requested tattoo diary whatever
you want to call it basically long story
short in this video I'm going to go
through all of my tattoos showing all of
them to you guys telling you when I got
them and telling you the meaning behind
all of them since each of them kind of
have their own reason for why I got them
as well as just like multiple meanings
behind all of them you like wearing this
leather jacket but it's not the smartest
idea cuz it's just like every time I
move it's like squeaky almost okay so
the first tattoo that I ever actually
got was of my fearless tattoo so it is
the tattoo that is on this wrist I got
this tattoo when I was 18 years old it
was my first ever one and I literally
decided as the day before and I just
remembered my sister and I we were in
her room which was in our basement at
the time and we just walked up this
tattoo place and we were like she be she
should be go get a tattoo tomorrow we
both didn't even know what we were
getting until pretty much when we got
there the next day and I decided to get
fearless on I decided to get fearless
because I actually remember reading
somewhere that being fearless wasn't not
being afraid or lack of fear it was
doing things despite the fact that they
scare you to death even though you're
terrified you should just jump and do it
anyways that that is the definition of
being fearless that is how to be
fearless so that was kind of my
reasoning behind choosing to get it and
I suit on my wrist because feel like the
wrist is always like a safe bet for a
first tattoo so that was the first one
that I ever got then it was about a year
a year later just over a year later when
I got my second tattoo which is the
tattoo that I have on my thigh again
this tattoo a lot of my tattoos were
various rows
but again this tattoo one of my best
friends at the time and I decided that
we were gonna get some tattoos I known
for about a week that I wanted to get
she flies with her own wings but I
didn't know where I wanted to get it and
it wasn't I'm not kidding you until we
were in the car I had to drive to her
house so she could run inside I she was
inside I called her and I was like can
you bring shorts like I want to get it
on my leg reason why I knew I wanted it
this was also again following the year
of like things that went on with my
family it was like I kind of explained
all that in my drawing my life if you
guys watched my draw my life you'll know
what part of my life I'm talking about
but it was just after all of that
happened and I remember I also had
broken up with my like high school
boyfriend it's him and I like we were on
and off but we were together for a
couple of years so even that in itself
kind of scared scared the living crap
out of me I guess you could say because
I wasn't used to being alone I've ever
wanted to get the quote not even just to
signify my independence but also to kind
of signify how dropping out of school
with going home with having no idea
where my future was about to take me but
just doing it anyways it kind of not
only showed me that I can be independent
but it reiterated how independent I had
felt my whole life I just remember this
like realization that everything I had
gone through my life I had kind of
pulled myself through in some way even
when I didn't fully understand it I
found a way to get myself through it so
it was kind of like one of those tattoos
that was a promise to myself I guess you
could say to just like stay independent
to remind myself that no matter what
life throws at you like you can pull
yourself through it you can always get
there on your own two feet with
everything that you have within yourself
not that it's bad to meet other people
or to rely on other people but no matter
what you're always going to be able to
like you know fly with your own wings so
that was kind of the idea behind that
one a third tattoo and my fourth tattoo
I actually got them on the same day and
it was my Nicholson signature on the
side of my hand and I have an arrow on
the side of my ribs at this point I had
gone with my best friend Christine knew
for a fact that I wanted to get the
Nicholson tattoo but I was also really
itching for more than just that so I
decided to go and get two so this
tattooed on the side of my hand is my
last name my Papa who had passed away
that year
he had sent me a birthday card and
because he was on the East Coast he had
to actually send it by mail so he had to
write my full name on the envelope I
have this weird thing where I saved
birthday cards and envelopes so when he
ended up passing away the following
summer I decided to cut off the
nicholson part from the envelope and get
a tattooed on the side of my hand
because not only was it my last name
which will I mean hopefully maybe
someday changed also just because it was
the last birthday card that he would
ever be alive for and it just so
happened that he sent it to me it's just
so weird like to think that he was just
writing it on that envelope having no
idea that it would be tattooed on my
hand for the rest of my life it's just
one of those things that's a little
piece of him that I'll always have kind
of with me and so that is why is
actually my favorite tattoo that I have
on my whole body and then the other
tattoo that I got that day was the arrow
so I actually drew this arrow myself
which is not that impressive because
it's literally just an arrow reason
behind it it's because I wanted it an
arrow but I wanted the end of the arrow
to be a heart so in a weird way it kind
of is like following your heart and
that's why I also got it on this side
because it's you know sad that has my
heart on it so I made the point of the
arrow heart and then I made six feathers
one for each person that was basically
significant for my like direct family
growing up so my mom and my dad my
sister my brother my Nana my papa so
follow your heart but take your people
with you is kind of like the idea behind
it and I got it
right there because I mean again at this
point in my life this is wait when I had
taken on YouTube full-time and it was
just one of those things that I had no
idea if it was gonna work or not but I
just knew I wanted to follow my heart
and trust my gut and so that's why I got
it the fifth tattoo that I ended up
getting was my faith tattoo and you guys
have probably seen this one before it's
actually on the inside part of my arm on
this hand and this tattoo I got last
November so just about a year ago I
don't know if I actually ever did fully
explain what made me go do it and why I
got it unless maybe I have since then I
can't remember but I just remember at
the time I I know I didn't at the time
2016 was a pretty hard year I think just
in the sense to that I don't tend to
deal with things when they initially
happen I tend to kind of push things
down and deal with it later so there was
a lot of things that kind of hit me
faced in 2016 it was my first year being
completely single like for since the
time pretty much that I was 15 it was my
first time living alone and it was also
the first time that I really took a full
swing I guess you would say my mental
health it was one of those things where
like I had always dealt with my mental
health issues but they really hit hard
that year and the reason why I ended up
getting it was I was starting to go
through a really really rough time with
my depression and my anxiety but more
specifically my depression not only was
I so anxious that I wasn't leaving my
apartment I also just got so depressed
that it wasn't that I couldn't get out
of bed it was like I was going through
the motions but I was not there like I
was not checked in I always felt like I
was so out of body if that makes any
sense I just became super numb to
everything even just looking back on it
it was really scary to kind of go
through because I really saw my dark
side I guess you could say where I got
to a point that I just didn't want to
live anymore there was one specific day
that I was sitting at my desk and I was
just looking out the window I just
remember thinking like I I just don't
think I can do it anymore I just don't
think I can wake up and fight so hard to
find the good and it was such a heavy
heavy feeling and such a serious feeling
I realized how scared shitless I was and
it was one of those things where I was
like I need to do something because this
isn't okay the way I'm thinking the way
I'm feeling is scaring me excited that
the only way I would get through it the
only way that anyone could get through
it is that you have to find something to
have faith in and it doesn't necessarily
mean you have to have faith in a
religion I get asked you know what are
my beliefs what's my religion and I
don't resonate I wouldn't say I resonate
with any religion I just I think I'm
definitely spiritual and I definitely
believe in things but I don't
necessarily you know categorize it into
one solid religion no ill words to
anyone that does believe in those things
and in a way I kind of do I just I
personally believe that the universe or
the energy that we gain from everything
in a way is God if that makes sense and
that everything happens for a reason and
everything in life is a blessing or
lesson and the only way you can ever see
the blessing is by finding the lesson or
learning the lesson and so I decided to
basically put the little bit of myself
that I had left into holding on to that
faith that even though I couldn't see it
it's kind of like driving down a dark
road and your headlights are only
letting you see so far ahead this sucks
right now the way I feel sucks right now
I'm feeling to the point that I don't
even see a point in living anymore and
that sucks but maybe I'm only seeing
this far ahead and if I give up now I
won't know what's further on down the
road because I quit and dropped off the
road too soon and so I decided to have
faith that I can't see the bigger
picture but something else has a bigger
picture in store for me and that was
kind of why I decided to get my face
tattoos so my faith tattoo is definitely
I think the most personal it's a huge
reminder every day as to what I decided
to have faith in and the reason why I
decided to get it where I did is because
this is one tattoo that I see every
single day every single time I have a
really really good day or all the good
days my feature that have yet to come
you know the day I get married the day I
hold my kids for the first time you know
even just there's been times where I've
been holding Bentley and I'll see it and
it's just such a reminder that those
days are the days that I decided to
believe in even when I couldn't see them
yet even when I didn't even know that
they would exist yet even a day like
today where I went for a run and where
this new shirt that I bought that made
me super excited Bentley and I went for
a long walk this morning Greg's coming
over later we're gonna play Yahtzee and
drink wine like even days as simple as
today I see that tattoo and I remember
that this is what I decided to have
faith in and I know that this video is a
video just me explaining my tattoos but
I just need to take a quick second for
any of you guys that might be watching
this and resonated with anything I just
said
find your face find what you decide to
believe in that will pull you through
those dark times because trust me when I
say you can't give up you got to keep
going even though your foresight is only
so far ahead and you might not be able
to see yourself feeling any better in a
few days you might not see yourself
feeling better in a few weeks or months
whatever it is but there is a time that
you are gonna feel better and you need
to hold on to that and make that happen
because it's so worth it
I didn't want to turn this into like
that kind of huge type of life chat but
I did want to explain to you guys fully
I think in depth what this tattoo means
to me because I don't think I ever have
before and I don't think I was ever
ready to before so that is the fifth
tattoos that I got these six tattoo that
I got was this year I actually went on a
impromptu Europe trip with Alayna as you
guys remember I've logged a bunch of it
I can leave links down below throughout
the whole trip we knew we wanted to get
a tattoo at some point but we decided to
do it Paris we were actually at lunch we
just like walked through the Eiffel
Tower explored that area while we were
waiting for our food we found a place we
went there it was actually really close
to where we were staying and so we just
did it we got clouds on our fingers and
this one has multiple meetings for me I
think part of it was the idea of the
fact that we were traveling and free and
so that was part of the reason why I got
it another reason is because I knew I'm
one of the clouds solely for the fact
that I always have my head in the clouds
it's very much true to who I am by
nature and also I got the cloud because
I don't know if I've ever told you guys
this but it's kind of like a thing where
I call like my apartment or even just
like my atmosphere my cloud even want to
go traveling and I go to a hotel room I
will cozy the out of that hotel
room I will like throw blankets I'll
bring my pillow so I'll bring my
slippers and so everywhere I go I kind
of bring this little cloud with me and
so that's also kind of why I got it and
I actually love the placement of the
both of these two together now and then
my seventh and final tattoo is the one
that I just recently got in the back of
my arm I've logged it if you guys
haven't seen it I will pop it up on the
screen but I ended up getting an upside
down triangle on the back of my arm for
a few reasons
I have one of the triangle tattoo you
guys for like two years but I just
didn't know where I wanted to put it I
didn't know the size I just never felt
like the right time place or moment and
the reasoning behind it is when you
first look at it it is an upside
a triangle which is the actual sign for
the element of water and I have a water
sign and I resonate a lot even though
there's no scientific basis on
horoscopes I don't care you could
believe it whatever you decide to
believe in and I definitely resonate a
lot with the characteristics of my
waterside that said when I look at it
it's a right-side out triangle meaning
fires so for me even though nobody else
can see it everybody else just sees
water I can still see the fire in the
water that despite all of the things
that make me you know kind of sensitive
and emotional there's also a side of me
that's determined also the side of me
that gets super passionate and energetic
about things that I'm really into and
can make things happen if I need them to
and so it's just kind of like a constant
reminder to myself that even though you
can be peaceful you can be easygoing and
light like water you can also be loud
you can also be determined and you can
also be as strong and as capable as fire
and that's kind of the idea behind it so
it's kind of like an illusion and nobody
needs to tell you that you're fired
you just need to see that your fire
there's a train going by no it also
symbolizes mind body and soul and past
present and future and those are two
things that I also strongly believe are
so heavily intertwined and connected and
don't think that you can only heal your
mind or your body or your soul I think
all three need to be in equilibrium and
I also believe that you need to make
peace with your past be awake in the
present and just be accepting of the
unknown that is the future in order to
also live your best life so that is that
those are the seven tattoos that I
currently have to date I don't know if
I'll be getting any tattoos anytime soon
I feel like I probably will take in at
least another year or two of a break if
you guys have any tattoos leave a
comment down below tell me what it is
tell me why you got it and aside of that
I'll see you guys all in tomorrow's
twelve days of gayness space
I'm hoping that you understand you ain't
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
