pretty girls and starting conversations
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
and for today's video I'm going to be
doing up my ever requested record
collection for you guys that I promised
a couple I think I promised it like a
month ago but let me say it also feels
mighty good to be sitting here doing a
sit-down style video with you guys I've
been doing a lot of vlogs lately and I
think you're going to start seeing a bit
more of a balance on my channel whether
vlogs are going to be going away but
these are going to start coming back I
also have never sat in this location
before so thumbs up if you guys are like
this as opposed to me sitting up on the
bed i realistically had to do it because
i had to put my record player up here so
that would be in the shot for you know
the video that i'm filming today the
candle is going well we all vibes going
so if you guys like this thumbs up or
comment down below
I feel like this this makes sense so for
today's video I'm going to be filming on
my record collection with you guys as I
previously mentioned I have all my
records in my little basket here there
were a few more funny story that I
ordered but I actually wasn't paying
much attention when I was ordering them
online it was like pretty late pretty
late at night like who I am
and I ordered a bunch of Records and
they came as CDs that that's the truth
so maybe I'll have to do an updated one
or like include some in a haul video
later on but I do want to share with you
guys the ones that I do have now because
I feel like it's the type of music that
I mean unless you guys are following me
on Spotify you might already know this
but the music that I put in my videos
while I love the crap out of it I have
this little like part of me that loved
more indie style music and I feel like
it's really hard to include those into
like upbeat videos so I'm going to be
able to share with you guys some of my
favorite bands that you might not have
even heard of or if you have them were
meant to be best friends without further
ado let's just jump in because I have a
lot that I want to show you guys so I'm
not going to be doing these in any sort
of order I'm just going to show you guys
just what I have from basically what I
was most previously listening
first record I have to share with you
guys is no bow or more if you guys have
not heard of number or more you need you
need to you need to give them a lesson
nomura is actually one of my all-time
favorite bands if you are following me
on Spotify and you follow like my crisp
leaves and lattes playlist my fall
playlist which I've been updating I know
it's a little early but I don't care and
you probably have heard of good old
Bilbo more there's actually only four
songs on this record and I'm going to
share with you guys my favorite one the
songs on it are carry you color weigh
anchor and embody me with anchors being
my favorite song so shall we
so yeah that is anchor by Nova more
definitely one of my favorites and
probably like my go-to for like rainy
days or like really really late night
and with ball coming up guys I highly
recommend this one food also I guess I
should probably mention this because I'm
wondering what record player I have I
just have like the good old standard
basic Crosley and a lot of people that
listen to records and such kind of hate
on the Crosby's a little bit but mine is
never gave me any issues I've been able
to listen to all of my records without
any problems and I've had mine for over
a year now I think they're cute and I
think if you're not looking to like over
invest it if you just want something
basic to listen to some records list and
it's it's pretty standard I haven't had
any issues with it and the nice thing
about it too is it also gives you the
chance to like use an axillary cord if
you want to which i don't overly
understand because I mean it's nice if
you need to use an ancillary cord but I
feel like what you're getting a record
player it's so much more worth it to
listen to records it just sounds so much
more epic my own personal opinion but
leave a bunch of record players down
below multiple these links to all of my
records down below as well and yeah
let's keep them up so the next are gonna
have to show you guys which is actually
eerily similar even like font and like
art wise to novo more his daughter so if
you guys watched my Europe haul which
I'll pop somewhere up on the screen here
you'll know that I actually picked this
record up in Scotland so I was in
Edinburgh with I was struggle to say
that with Atlanta and there was this
really really cool record store that I
was like drawn to and I just really
wanted to stop there and just surf
through the records and see if there's
anything there that I couldn't find -
you're in Toronto and I've been looking
for this record by daughter here in
Toronto and I couldn't actually find it
so it was really cool that I found it
there and I love I love the artwork and
this one guys like I don't know there's
something really cool about it and like
the inside is it's just so it's there's
something about this genre of music that
I know that it's like kind of depressing
like Greg Greg makes fun of me all the
time like you'll come over and he'll be
like why do you listen to such sad music
and I'm like because it's not
sad to me it's like peaceful so this
record is if you leave my daughter the
songs on it are winter smooth youth
still life forms tomorrow human touch
and stir damp and shallow so I'm going
to go ahead and pop this record on and
share with you guys my favorite song for
this one
again it's kind of like a similar vibe
where it's very like hauntingly
beautiful like nova more and the lyrics
to her songs are absolutely like they
give you like goosebumps so I highly
recommend if you guys don't already
listen to daughter to check her out the
next record I have to share with you
guys is the blink 182 California record
this one's going to be a little bit
different than the ones we were just
talking about
so I actually picked this up off of
Amazon as well and again can we just
with the artwork this is insanity guys
even the inside is insane like a dead
zombie dude freaking driving a car down
like blink 182 you will forever be epic
I don't care what anyone says I'll have
to blow your mind right now the record
is yellow so I will play you guys some
of this blink 182
but of course that by listening to from
their newest album you guys want to
listen to it I highly suggest it like
nothing will ever be the good old school
like blink 182 but I have to admit like
their music is really good but sometimes
it wakes up the morning I just want to
like throw on some blink-182 kind of
rock out while I start my morning off
right looks good Monday morning and just
look at just a really good album when
you just kind of want to like head Bob
you know like Monday more you just need
some head Bob's making dinner you need
to do some head Bob I'm next if you guys
been following me for a while you may
have peeps this in the background in
other videos but it is my old wonder
record guys this record will forever be
one of my favorites Maggie and I found a
wonder that in the day when they were
still on soundcloud this record brings
me back because I remember being in my
bedroom in that apartment with mags and
we throw this on and we put like cool
lamps on in the room and we would just
like talk about life or do weird
like we were so I like honestly if you
could ever get the chance to live with
your best friend do it unrelated to this
video they they say like really cool
downtempo style music this is definitely
like a good night time chill type of
album for me my favorite one from this
album though is Technicolor Viet which I
will put on for you guys
white blood is also a huge favor to my
heart about another epic song barnacles
is also really good too and livewire I
didn't even have to look at the records
event lol that is my L wonder album and
it is banned this one is ventured with
me over the last three apartments now
and I love it
your next album I have to share with you
guys is boniva blood bank because I went
and saw him I was like sucked into his
essence blood bank is probably it has to
be one of my I think it might actually
I'm just going to go ahead and say a
blood bank is my finger Bon Iver song
what this also really good too but I
knew that I needed to have this in my
life
also the back like side B has it's
really cool like clouds like I don't
even know what that is
Nancy wood oh I literally like oh
there's something about Bonnie bear that
is like other something about his music
and a vibe that just sucks me in it like
it's so good so I was like doing art if
I was going to be painting or writing
what I'm working on like my books and
things like that this is the one the
next second I have to share with you
guys is a kind of funny one it is a good
old Willie Nelson and if you were
wondering why the hell I have a Willie
Nelson record one because his vibe is
something that you just could not
capture or find anywhere else
and two because my papa was a huge fan
of Willie Nelson it's like an old
country singer and I will play you one
of his song complete provides the minds
of my other record
item first of all can we not just all
admit that that is like the happiest
music you've ever heard like doing the
dishes or paint around the apartment
Willie Nelson's a good good tune to
throw on and next Taylor Swift this is
not a record video without some Taylor
Swift and one of the records that I
actually ordered a set came as a CD by
the way that I mentioned previously in
this video why is it the red album and
so upset because I actually wanted I
needed you know I'm probably gonna buy
it today because I would love to listen
to it like on my record player but for
now
1989 is the only Taylor Swift record
that I have and I feel like when it
comes to actually listening to the
record one of my favorite ones to listen
to on here is clean pop that song on
mighty quick and then I only have two
more records to show you guys after this
I was epic I dropped it right on the
right song yeah I don't know why but
when it comes to this album I feel like
Queen was such an underrated song I have
so many favors off the 1989 album that
one is probably my favorite when it
comes to listening to it on my record
and next and second last on my list of
Records to share with you guys today is
my dawn golden record another artist
where if you haven't heard or listened
to him before he still he's also got
that like hauntingly beautiful in divide
to him perfect for a rainy day and I
will put this one out there this vibe is
perfect for when you're kind of having a
sad day the lyrics and his songs are so
insane that it blows my frickin minds
there is probably not one single salt on
here that I could say is my absolute
favorite I'll show you guys last train
probably be it if I had to choose Oh Don
golden is so good another record you
need to pick up before the fall time
rolls around and there's actually like a
full list of all the lyrics inside so if
you want to blow your mind on how
amazing he is at writing songs then you
can go ahead and do that as well and
then last but not least final record I
have to share with you guys is my hozier
record this is actually one of the first
ones I picked up the Christmas where I
actually got my record player this two
also has incredible artwork I know you
guys have probably seen the front cover
of Bossier before but like beautiful
sunset over like cliffs in the ocean
like come on and again when it comes to
fall I have to share with you guys
probably my favorite song it's the
cherry wine live version also on the
back of this envelope there's like a
night version like there's just so much
beautiful art
you hear that song and you just want to
sipping a latte at a cafe in like New
York City with like in the middle of
fall like in the middle of October so
again this one is actually on my fault
playlist I've already been updating here
that is the hozier album that I have and
it's so good
doing dishes cooking dinner scenes just
like a very chill vibe he's like a chill
dinner vibe where it's blink-182 was
like a rock out dinner guide you know so
that is it for my record collection
thumbs up if you guys enjoyed it let me
know if you guys have any of these
truckers listed down below or if you
guys have any recommendations of records
that I should pick up also let me know
I'm sorry though this video took so long
but you guys can definitely be expecting
a lot more sit-down videos I'm
definitely in the mood to start
balancing it out and I actually am going
to start filming soon for youtubers and
other than that I love you guys to the
moon back thank you guys so much for
chilling with me and listening to music
that just like honestly warmed me in my
heart so much I wish that you guys were
physically here and we could actually
bring all of our record players together
in all of our records and just like
chill out and drink decaf latte and
listen to them the string lights
everywhere and like in our cozy clothes
but you know what one day in the future
and as a nut I will see you guys all in
my next video bye guys
