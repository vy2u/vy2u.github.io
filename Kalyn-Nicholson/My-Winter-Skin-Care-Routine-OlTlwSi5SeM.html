to be sharing with you guys my winter
skin routine that I have recently
changed up seeing as the winter husband
pretty harsh on my skin so I'm just
gonna share with you the products that
have been working for me and what my
routine has been so this is basically
what I use on my day to day basis so I
always like to start out my morning with
a makeup wipe just to wash off any
residue that's there from the night
before or just from sleeping and just to
refresh my skin a little bit
and then after that I will obviously
moisturize my skin which is something
that actually wasn't doing before so
this has made quite a big difference on
my skin now and I just used the Olay
Total Effects so for some reason this
winter I've been breaking out a lot more
than usual so I've been using my Olay
fresh effects spot zinger and basically
it's just a spa treatment with Susilo
acid in it to get rid of the redness and
just the puffiness of any breakouts or
pimples I have
and some things I try and do throughout
the day to help my skin is drink a lot
more water than I'm used to and I
actually picked up a one liter jug from
Walmart and I just refill it all the
time and drink out of that to make sure
that I'm keeping on track of how much
water I'm drinking as well as just
eating a abundance of fruits and
vegetables which are also very good for
your skin another thing I like to do is
I always keep a hand cream in the purse
that I'm carrying around that day
because my hands tend to get extremely
dry especially with the cold wind and
the winter air outside
and something that I actually ballooned
recently is taking extremely hot showers
in the winter can dry your skin out even
more than usual and as for shaving Venus
actually sent me their swirl razor and
their Venus and Olay violet swirl
shaving cream so that is what I've been
using to to shave my legs and I like it
because the flexi ball makes it really
easy to shave tricky areas like my knees
and another thing I wasn't doing before
was actually using a shaving cream and
this is especially important to do in
the winter because the shaving cream
keeps it from stripping the moisture off
your skin and then always after shaving
of course you want to moisturize your
skin and I've been using a body butter
instead for the winter since it is a
thicker consistency I find it adds a lot
more moisture to your skin rather than a
more watered-down body lotion and I'm
always sure to do this on my entire body
especially before going to bed so I will
lather up and make sure I moisturize
absolutely everywhere especially after a
shower or shaving and then for my
nightly face skin care routine I like to
exfoliate at least two to three times a
week just to clear all the dead skin
cells and create a nice smooth canvas on
my face and for the days that I'm not
going to be exfoliating I usually just
use a pretty basic foaming cleanser
and then more recently I've been using
at this Olay overnight mask which
absorbs into your skin overnight making
my skin feel nice and smooth in the
morning
and then one more time I'll go in with
the little spot singer and just get the
places that seem to be very very
troublesome
and then lastly and one of the most
important things is I try to get at
least six to eight hours of sleep every
single night to make sure that my skin
is refreshed and just that I'm not
cranky so yeah so that has been my most
recent skincare routine that I've
changed up for this winter I hope you
guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys on a
future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
