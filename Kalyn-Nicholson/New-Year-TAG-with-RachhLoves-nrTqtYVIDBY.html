start selling stoop but oh we're
recording yeah hold on well then 2015
good here for both of us I like it high
five hey guys so for today's video I am
here with Rachel abbs of actually at her
house her beautiful beautiful house so
for today's video I'm going to be doing
like a new year new year's kind of tag
we believe all of these questions down
below so I want to carry your guys's
answers as well and just it's just a fun
way to kind of prep for the new year and
you know good times like it's like
really fun like easy you want to go back
and like reflect and like yeah over the
last year and like what are you looking
forward to and enjoy here and I love the
new year I'm someone that like new year
I'm always like a fresh start kind of
person I'm like a my diet starts on
Monday kind of person every single week
so it's like it's January and September
yeah right fresh fresh starts and spring
is really all the time it's like every
Monday question number one is rate 2015
on a scale of one to ten you don't like
a Y you go first
okay okay okay um this was tricky
because I was like do I compare it
against like other years or is it just
like I was like a random I don't know
but like I like it yeah so I think for
me it would definitely be this last year
has been a really good year for me it's
been like really exciting and really fun
and just to feel like I've gotten to
figure myself yeah thanks I'm actually I
feel like I feel the same right it's
just been like a good like 2015 like I
feel it was a good year huh sorry I
would give it like like an 8 9 cuz like
I don't know what a 10 is what is it Jen
so like this year I I found out I was
pregnant what number two so having baby
boy and so that was really excited I'm
so excited I'm excited it's like it's
fun like it's just like it's been a
really good year for that and like to
see my daughter grow and just we went
traveling we went to LA and just have a
punch-up out there and just it's just
been a really fun year and like figuring
out balance and all that stuff yeah
that's awesome yeah it's a good I'm at
home I'd probably go around like an
eight eight or nine as well probably not
9
I'd go eight dozen if Dean was really
good I got to travel I mean I remember
making my resolutions for last year and
saying I wanted to travel five new
places this year and I ended up
traveling to seven which is insane right
I know you know this is like a big year
for finding out who
like who my real friends were and who
are the people that I really wanted to
stay close to me and and just it was a
good year I would say especially as
opposed to 2014 I would say 2015 was a
big jump to a better a better me and
2015 again I find I feel like I found
myself a lot this year I'm kind of
digging more deep and like figure out
where oh yeah like what things I believe
in what things I don't believe in like
what really makes me happy doesn't make
me happy what kind of content I want to
be making just question number two is
what are your favorite memories from
2015 like if I had to pick like one
moment that was your absolute favorite
it was telling my husband Chris that we
were having a baby boy I just got these
funds yeah it was like super exciting
and I'd planned it since I had my first
yeah and I was like if we have a sec
life we have a second and it's a boy
this is the only way I'm gonna be able
to do it and I guess I'm planning it it
was like freaking me out cuz I'm like it
needs to go perfectly so basically all I
did is I I bought this like little pink
pajama thing that was like a big enough
for Julia my two-year-old and I brought
it was like surprise and Chris is like a
girl and I was like oh no actually this
is for Julia I thought it'd be really
nice if he got something for his big
sister kind of thing and he's like it
was like I saw it's like it was like
super like exciting because like now I
have a girl and I have a boy and I'm
just like the perfect family like you
are you are my goals I'm not gonna be
able to talk that this is a really hard
question like favorite memory is
traveling I guess like I thought New
York was really cool I got to put in New
York City and I I have a very nature
nature type person I love nature but
there was something about the big city
that was just you could get lost and no
one knows who you are and you're just in
a blur of faces and it's just so you
just they're just feeling about New York
City that I just love so New York City
was definitely a really good memory mine
question number three is did you change
at all this year and this can be like
appearance or inside like all the inner
gooey stuff like what the good thing is
about you said I know so for me I mean
the obvious one is growing a pregnant
belly many big basketball on the front
oh my gosh she looks the tiniest little
pregnant thing ever and for like myself
like mentally I think my biggest thing
is just sort of
figuring out how to balance I think like
everything like between YouTube and
family and friends and like just even
like the home and like things are being
by yourself even sometimes I'm having
some me time it's just balanced it's a
lot to like figure out all those pieces
yeah how much do I kind of bucket into
each yes exactly I feel like that was
like a big change for me it's closer
getting started at least figuring out
what that yeah for me I would say my
biggest change I had a lot I think of
personal changes this year I think the
beginning of the year who I was at the
beginning of the year is so different
than who I feel right now like the
beginning of 2015 to the beginning of
2016
in what way so a different I by the way
I look at life the way I everything I I
feel like a lot of you guys might know
that even just from watching me just my
like content changed but even just do
who I am changed a lot this year a
little bit not so hard on myself or hold
myself up to all these standards as much
anymore and just again what the
balancing like figuring out that that
you know it's okay to take some time and
hang up by yourself or hang out with
your friends or hang out with your
really I mean my not big belly but my
still baby even spiritually I've changed
a lot this year I think I've really
figured out what I believe in and I
think it's always kind of been there
it's just been a big year of
self-discovery for me to think I'm
learning how to just you know love the
world for the way it is and see the good
and not Sall ways so so much focus on
the bad that goes on so so question
number four is did you stick with any of
your 2015 New Year's resolutions for me
I tend to not stick to like giant
resolutions and starting at the
beginning of the year just me I find
that I'm like I've pretend to forget
something so for me I tend to set sort
of overarching themes that I'm yeah
stick to but like then I sort of
tailored them as things come up in life
and kind of really smart mahler see you
know goals right here I find like if I
have the resolutions they're just
hanging over my head for like the entire
layer you know as a pressure already
starting the year on your shoulders
right
yeah so I think breaking them up into
smaller pieces it makes you want to
fulfill them yeah exactly so you stuck
to them yeah well yeah I mean like not
too healthy eating one that Oh
you're growing it uh human inside you I
think it should you hated chocolate
human yeah a boy LDP boy wanted his
chocolate that's not your fault
my New Year's resolutions it's funny I
actually like I write I read my journal
what so I went and looked at my new
year's resolutions from the beginning of
the year and some of them are so stupid
and then I was because I was just like
what was I thinking like scrap that but
like obviously the travel wasn't stayed
the other one I stuck to you well it
kind of more so I would say later on in
the year is just getting more healthy
and that was definitely something I've
more recently started to really take
seriously like since the summertime just
so you know my gosh guys I'm like
running around even if I just go for a
walk she seems like a nice out child
that you guys watch her snapchat because
like seriously like every time I see
your like pictures of stuff and you're
like I just go back from a run I'm like
sitting here with my chips and like is
did you travel anywhere in 2015 and is
so weird I traveled to LA with the
family so we went actually we went out
there for beautycon I was gonna go by
myself and I was like it's fine I'll
just go by myself at the last minute
like I can't do it idea everyone my
whole family like me
I'm always googling like can I bring my
dog to this place which is so different
that is terrible so we went there so it
was my husband myself and my daughter
and we all went out there and it was
just it was so much fun and being able
to take her into like the water for the
ocean and like the beach and all this
but that's I was so fun I did like a
little trips like cottages and stuff oh
yeah like cottage country I feel like
that's a big like Canadian thing oh you
did a lot of traveling I do okay oh and
January went to Cuba and then straight
after that I went to like I think I
wasn't like a week and then I went to
New York that was a really short trip
though and then I went to Dominican
Republic I went to Vegas where else
there's so many more places onto British
Columbia
Oh British Columbia on my heart you
stole my heart British class what
there's more you shouldn't think there
was more than I think there was like
seven different places I traveled this
year but there's so many anything yeah I
was really lucky this year to travel a
lot of places so the next question is
what is something you're looking forward
to in 2016 so 2016 and Wonder
so having baby is like the big the big
that's my answer I'm excited for your
baby I'm just boy like labor to be over
and like have the baby
yeah it's like I already did labor once
I feel
you should have to do labor once yeah
and then you have like they should just
disappear disappear like all the sudden
we're not in your stomach and it's just
here it's just right it's like The Sims
where they jump in the air and Spink
that was a big one for me and then also
coming with more like creative YouTube
content yes it's just like I get so I
know you say oh I'm so dorky but we're
like we talked about this forever
yeah all about the YouTube and and it's
just fun to come up with like okay
welcome what else can we do like yeah
what something new we're like my
excitement for 2016 besides Rachel's
baby I'm excited I don't know that's
there's tons of answers I'm definitely
excited to move into a house this year
in the summer we are planning to adopt a
new dog so we're getting our technically
second baby I feel like that's terrible
of me to say you're actually like
growing a human and I'm like oh we're
getting our second baby - oh you wanna
adopt a little brighter for Bentley I'm
like I'm like a not so awesome version
of your life yeah I've always wanted a
big dog but where I was out when I was
getting Bentley is like it was just a
small dog er no dogs so and I'm so glad
I went a small dog and not no dog
because Bentley is actually my spirit
animal
give the cutest little thing in the
entire William and then the last one is
what are three resolutions you have for
the new year I had again going with the
whole like themes of things for yeah
specific eye problem is I'm gonna steal
that to do it it's so much better and it
makes you feel like you're just
accomplishing more yeah so for me
balance is one of them getting outside
of my comfort zone oh that's a big one
yeah you know big time cuz sometimes you
just get so stuck in your own head nor I
relate and then finding and it could be
like little ways like just you know
trying out some new content on YouTube
or like we're get a small opportunity
and you're like I'm gonna say no it's
like just things like that and then the
other one is a trusting my instincts I
think that was a big thing for me this
year is just sort of going back and
forth being like this is the right call
she'll be doing this and like it could
be with life it could be with YouTube it
could be anything
and just sort of doubting myself a lot
and so I think that for 2016 I really
want to kind of listen to my gut a
little bit yeah and really focus on
making that sort of my ground yeah but I
trust on yourself you know what I think
I do know well for myself this time for
me I would say one of them is definitely
to stick to my guns with this whole
health kick that I've been on I don't
even call it a health care because I'm
not saying like it's just a sluggish the
whole like eating healthier and and the
big one for me is not even just so much
working out cuz it's not for me like how
I look aesthetically it's just I find it
very look again and I get something I
get very stuck in my head and just
sometimes with all the stress and
struggle and you feel like you need to
be doing a million things at once
sometimes just going outside for a run
or just going to like even a yoga class
or something it's so like calming and
you just you just really like get two
weeks yeah you're resetting you're doing
something that specifically just for you
really pushing myself this year I really
want to push myself to with even with
the comfort zone thing like I am a
creature of habit and I'm definitely
somebody that I I get very anxious when
I'm unknown especially like going out
and just in public places and being
around people I don't really know and
just things like that I really want to
push myself to you know they have a
little bit more confidence in myself and
just be like you know what you don't
have to go home right now or you know
what you can do this walk into that room
with people you don't know or situation
of people you don't know and just do it
or and things like that so really
finding like inner confidence and you
know being at peace with myself not
feeling like I need to be a certain way
or look a certain way or whatever so
just that like those types of things
walking into her we're just like getting
out of the house sometimes sometimes you
get so like sit on your space you know
and it's just like I wrote about y'all
