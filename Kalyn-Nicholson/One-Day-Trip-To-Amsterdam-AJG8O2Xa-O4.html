Paris trip now well to extra damn - what
if all parties inside
don't know
please
baby
and stood up on saddam hang out for a
little bit and then we're probably gonna
go to sleep and wake up earlier tomorrow
that we have a full day to just explore
and earlier a year feels nice to talk to
you guys again i enjoyed filming that
paris passport for postcards to paris
video but this feels right
maybe crazy crazy
so greetings from lovely Amsterdam we
can stop has a place called oh sweet
Jesus Youth Cup I'm not even going to
try let me just show you I might make my
life a lot easier sign you up getting
mango and strawberry sorbet and now
we're just kind of walking around and
explain we might try and do like a boat
tour
who knows we're only really in Amsterdam
until tomorrow so we're trying to give
it much of that Amsterdam experience but
we can't and while we're here I'm really
wanting to use this right now by the way
don't judge me I'm going to cut back to
the b-roll and keep it going Amsterdam
with you guys
we welcome singer
what do i people
you can hurt me so it is our last
morning in Amsterdam and we did a mini
Meetup and we had to show up is their
name yeah I remember
oh so glad you guys came
so I'm an owl officially back in Toronto
I just got home about 15 minutes ago not
even I technically been awake since 2:00
a.m. Toronto time and we're closing it
on like 6:00 so I'm pretty dang tired if
I do say so myself
that was like one of the longest flights
of life I didn't have any TV or anything
like loaded and there were no screens
nothing to charge my phone so I
literally just hung out and listened to
music for eight and a half hours
straight shape Touche it's like the
first time in my life I think I started
to get sick of my own playlist Europe
was so so much fun I'm like part of me
is so happy to be home where there's
laundry and where I can hit the gym in
the morning and get some groceries and
get back into a routine for a little bit
but lately it's just been so overwhelmed
without happy it traveling makes me and
I'm so grateful to be able to do it and
I'm so grateful obviously for you guys
like I feel like I'm a broken record but
to support me and to literally give me
the ability to do what I do it's just
like I'm a little sleep deprived I could
get emotional talking about this but
it's just really it's bringing me
somewhere does that make sense like you
go places you come back I almost just
poke myself in the eye there but you
feel like it's also part of the journey
that's bringing you somewhere that's the
only way I can describe it like it just
feels like it just feels right I love it
so much oh my lord I'm going to start
planning my next trip now but that's
that for the next few weeks you can
probably expect me to get back into a
bit of a routine there's going to be a
bunch of snapchats
all that fun stuff I have a bunch of
like ideas for videos coming up over the
next little bit of getting back into
like a fitness routine for the summer so
if you guys have any requests leave them
down below and other than that I feel
like I shouldn't say much more because I
feel super weird and tired right now so
probably I don't want to play I hope you
guys enjoyed it this little mini
Amsterdam vlog and the cool Paris
postcard vlog and the scotland's law
thank you guys for traveling on this
journey with me and as always I love you
guys coming back and I will see you guys
all in my next video
