force field I wear my heart upon my
sleeve like a big deal you love God down
on me surrounds me like a waterfall okay
so it is Monday this day one of my
fitness log instead of a fitness blog I
don't know what we're going to call
these so this morning I woke up at 7
a.m. I have my coffee and then I went
straight to the gym in terms of my gym
attire today leggings are from urban
planet they've got like the mesh oats
detailing down the side and they're just
like capris then this shirt that I'm
wearing is also from Victoria's Secret
if I can find the links I got in a while
ago but if I can find the links I'll put
them down below and then for my gym
workout today today with legs and butt
today so I did a lot of squats I did a
lot of burpees um some lunges and a
bunch of stuff like that I'm sure you
guys you're seeing right now so I just
went through two different circuits and
did so eight workouts two times does
that make sense so there was a circuit
with four different workouts and another
circuit was for dope for workouts and
then I did the first one again then I
did the second one again and then for
breakfast today I'm having a smoothie it
looks disgusting and brown but it's just
because of the spinach in here I have a
banana a cup of frozen blueberries some
almond milk and water and a cup of
spinach and this should time you over
just until I like get ready and stuff
like that and of course I'm checking my
am water so that's about as much as I've
gotten done it's not clearly enough I
need to chug way more of this that is my
morning so far finish the smoothie and
get ready to film some videos okay so it
is now dinner time for a snack I had
Topher e today which is like it sounds
disgusting seems like a weird craving I
had today so I had some tofurkey for a
snack and then for lunch I made myself
like a rice stir fry which basically had
basmati rice like Italian herbs
vegetables and then mustard and teriyaki
sauce and then for dinner I made myself
some potatoes these are two whole yellow
potato and then I steamed them and then
I put hummus and teriyaki and a bit of
balsamic and like some lemon juice and
I'm eating them with some ketchup
doesn't sound like
much but I swear potatoes will fill it
all I'm eating is to some avocado with
comments and a little bit of vinegar so
getting here the microwave because I'm
literally making dinner right now but it
is now Tuesday in the States to what I'm
now going to call my fitness challenge
instead of making this sort of like a
fitness log I can make it a challenge if
you guys hope you guys want to do the
fitness challenge I'll put all the
credentials down below or exactly what I
did this week I guys was so sore from
yesterday's workout like the strength
training that I did that I didn't like I
wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to
even get a cardio session in as my
button legs are literally so bored I had
a snack of veggie dogs not the
healthiest but again they're like a good
snack to tell you over it for lunch I
made myself a rice stir-fried broccoli
and peppers and onions and stuff in it
and mustard and teriyaki sauce and right
now I'm making dinner which is pretty
much this is going to sound super boring
but it's going to be the exact same
thing I'm just adding beans this time
around so tomorrow's work it's a bit
different because I'm actually going to
be doing a yoga class that I signed up
for I haven't been doing yoga class been
so long though that I'm kind of a little
bit worried if I'm being honest if you
guys
see Wednesday records this morning I had
a smoothie everything the same as my
other sanity's except instead of
blueberries I switched over to
strawberries and then for like an early
dinner I ended up making myself teriyaki
potatoes there's this really amazing
recipe I have you just kind of a bunch
of yellow potatoes and then literally
steam them and then I made them with
teriyaki sauce mixed with hummus I love
doing yoga but I've never done hot yoga
before and I'm not like overly flexible
I'm going to hopefully bring a towel
anyone else I have a clean towel alright
let's give this hot yoga thing ago your
life
this
nor mine
Lucretia my
funny okay now that I'm back I might
order something like healthy so we're
staying in the challenge everything has
to be whole foods are healthy so let's
see here what could we get cauliflower
tahini organic quinoa house made hummus
really intense bootable okay so I'm
going with the first Canadian it has
organic quinoa organic tempeh organic
kale roasted en pomegranate beets
carrots rainbow radish purple cabbage
white cabbage organic sprouts sunflower
and sesame seeds with maple chive sauce
she'll see morning it is now Thursday
morning yeah we're on day four I just
woke up I'm having my coffee and to be
honest with you guys my body is feeling
very like not week was definitely
exhausted so I think what I'm going to
do is hit the gym to do a strength
workout they were going to do a muscle
group that isn't stored and those my ABS
my arms so right after this coffees
we're going to the gym
you
so this verbal update is a little late
in the game so correct me if I'm wrong
so to keep you guys posted and updated
for lunch I had a rice stir-fry that I
believe I showed you guys on camera and
after that I actually went to an event
that was in Toronto it was hosted by
L'Oreal we just got back from there head
so I have my makeup is off my face um
dang it into the heated blanket hi Ansem
oh my god you are so cute so for dinner
I think I'm going to make myself either
a stir fry again I'm probably going to
honestly take off all my makeup put on a
nice face mask and put on the OH way
because I've been I just started
watching the show it's really like I'm
so addicted right now I don't even know
what's going on here just time to make
myself some dinner for now we're going
to take a little Bentley for a walk you
can go for a walk and I know we're going
Pete you ready
hey guys it is now Sunday morning I'm
sorry if I sound a little weird my
throat is so sore like so sore right now
I'm not sure the last voice updated gave
you guys I've been vlogging my meals but
on Friday I started to feel this coming
on like the sore throat it's really hard
to swallow
oh well that's what she said I did a
quick cardio session on Friday but then
Saturday a K yesterday I didn't end up
doing anything I'm supposed to do hot
yoga oh my god and it's called from work
visiting they were bringing more things
from my old apartment I just feeling
really sore like my throat is so
freaking sore and then so this morning
I'm like well maybe I'll feel better by
today woke up this morning and no I
don't know what it is because I have no
other symptoms aside from this like
overwhelming sore throat but it now
Sunday morning I'm just having my coffee
full up phone but in case this vlog was
super confusing I'm going to recap what
we just did here so I figured I was
going to start doing not just my last
Monday vlogs all the time but I want to
start doing life challenges like vlog
style like record them vlog Styles I
kind of came up with that idea by the
time I had already started this it was
initially just going to be like a what I
ate slash the workouts I did this week
but then I figured why not make it a
challenge that once you guys watch it
I've done the challenge and then you
guys can do the challenge so this week's
challenge if you're all confused and
don't understand Whole Foods only it has
to be healthy Whole Foods there's no
strict diet don't do vegan you don't
have to do whatever you kind of vegan if
you want it but the only beverages I
drank were tea coffee and water and a
little bit of wine you can have a little
bit of wine just because you know I just
moved to the city in terms of working
out you work out five out of the seven
days and you can do one yoga class or
like one low intensity workout but the
other ones are like strength and cardio
so to cardio's to strength trainings one
low-impact workout that is the challenge
and then you get to rest days or you can
work out on the rest days as long as
it's low-impact so maybe I'll do a yoga
class today who know that was a fitness
challenge active this week guys I was so
serious about this this we guy people
being like there is people ask and we
like want to grab pizza like you want to
go for food I'm like I can't you decide
do the fitness challenge tweet me during
the week and let me know how it's going
or like just update me I want to know
I'm gonna go try and do like an easier
workout right now just after my coffee
because I just feel like groggy and
gross and like feel like I haven't moved
my body enough in the last two days so
that's it for the fitness challenge I
hope you guys enjoyed it let me know if
you liked this video down below or
something up I have another challenge
coming sooner than you think
and it is not Fitness related it's a
different challenge so I just think it'd
be fun to do all these different
challenges all the time to challenge
myself to get out of my comfort zone and
my shell and then in turn it's like kind
of documenting it and then maybe
inspiring you guys to do the challenges
with me it's thought it'd be a fun
different weighted like film videos for
YouTube I don't know trying to think
outside the box here so let me know if
you guys like that idea and if you guys
want to challenge me to do anything
comment it down below if you want to
challenge me to try five different vegan
restaurants in Toronto or if you guys
want to challenge me to like you know go
up to size new people or anything like
that there's any single challenge that
you guys want me to do and like document
and then turn it into a video like this
and challenge you guys to do the same
comment it down below I'll see you guys
all on Wednesday's video and I think
you're going to like it I think you're
going to like Wednesday's video just
because it's been so highly requested
