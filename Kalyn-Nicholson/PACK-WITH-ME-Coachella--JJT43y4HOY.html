sleep on the goat
okay starves you need me some coffee
computer to production meaning to user
to get your groovy waiting for the time
to pass you by hopeful and attain to
change your mind
I could give a sound
this way I know your hey guys oh yeah
that would be you
good morning guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm doing a
vlog kind of like a get ready for me for
vacation I'm going to show you guys how
I pack my suitcase all that fun stuff so
I actually leave for Coachella on
Thursday it's currently Tuesday but I
have so much stuff to get done I thought
it might be a fun way to kind of like
show you guys how I prep for trips and
things like that guys along with me
today and show you guys all the things
that I'm doing to prep for this trip I
already actually went earlier this week
and got my like beat done like my toes
painted and stuff like that I have to go
get my nails done I'm getting my
eyebrows done basically I'm doing all
that like super bougie extra things
because I don't want to have to do with
myself and also I like going and getting
my nails done when I'm going on a trip
because you know it's actually going to
stay the whole time if I paint my own
nails will chip before I even make it to
the plane my friend Christine is
actually still here I have to take
Bentley in for a little like doggy
meeting so that's kind of the plan right
now I'm going to have to drop Chris off
as a bus station it'll all fall together
nicely hopefully it will so with that
said let's start shall we cloning what I
know never been the best and as you go
I basically long story short I'm not
going to be able to board Bentley here
because while he is a little sweetheart
he was a little overwhelmed by
everything being so new and he's so used
to I think just being him and I all the
time at home that he wasn't really sure
what to do with all the other dogs he
was getting super like defensive of the
girl that was trying to integrate him
into all the other doggies and like all
that stuff and she said he had more time
to do more baby steps it could have been
good he probably won't do very well with
the boarding so she recommended some
other ideas for me for this weekend yes
so that's kind of where I'm at right now
her little guy was so excused and just
like not used to all the other dogs and
not used to situation and so once I'm
back we decided that we're going to take
baby steps and we're going to get him
used to kind of this style like like
doggy daycare I just don't feel
comfortable really leaving him at like a
boarding place and also I don't think he
feels comfortable with it we're going to
have to figure out something else to do
that's my update of the day it's all
good we're rolling with it it was new
now so I still have so much to do today
the day is still very young so fingers
crossed selves enough time to get all
the things
like a thief in the night I'm coming for
your heart I'm going for your heart
anything goes
I guess so I just ordered in someone
because I'm not gonna have time to run
out and grab anything so big you're just
ordering it here with me really really
quick and make my life a heck of a lot
easier I ended up picking up a salad so
I got some squash tacos to go with the
salad oven cooking with you know tacos a
salad on the side note these are massive
definitely not going to eat all of them
eat some of the salad and then put the
rest away for later I'm also like in the
midst of trying everything out for
Coachella right time for us to a live
taco try who's going to be a very
unattractive clip but hot damn this is
like crusted sweet potato tacos what
should we name it turn to cook you want
this table doing well for us to see the
only thing you gotta do follow me like a
thief in the night
I'm coming for your harm coming bro your
heart this trouble - anything goes I
guess I'm just too selfish comes
okay so been a while since I've logged
if you guys but the table lots of long
I'm going to show you guys exactly what
I do to pack my suitcase for vacation is
how else would we end this vlog it's
perfect
so just to give you guys a rough idea
the car service is coming to pick me up
at 5:30 in the morning or in time 1:30
so not only do I have to be awake in
four hours no sorry not only do I have
to be awake in like three and a half
hours because I need to like you know
pull myself together before I just jump
in the car and hit the plane but I also
have to just pack everything into this
hand baby suitcase so a few tips of
things that I like to do something that
I might have already pointed out in this
vlog and if not I'll do an overlay here
I like to write down what I need outfits
for so for instance I'm gone for five
days there's three days of Coachella
there's a pool party and then there's
also like a like a keel party that I'm
going to so I started out with sending
out all of those outfits first because
those are like the biggest most
mandatory outfits that I knew I needed
to be hype aside from that I told a few
more casual outfits for the daytime
things that we're doing a brunch outfit
and some PJ's a bathing suit and comfy
things to wear on the plane I find doing
it that way makes it so that I don't
over pack I know exactly what I'm
wearing and try everything on first
before I decide whether or not it's
going to be an outfit so I know it fits
I know how it all looks pieced together
and then I'm literally not over packing
if you guys didn't know this I once made
a packing checklist a really long time
ago because I made it so long ago it's
like I just like crops it's like 2013
okay don't judge me if I have enough
time I'll make a new one but either way
there will be packing checklists job so
no so I do that first I have all of my
outfits set aside and then last but not
least I set aside all of the electronics
I'm going to need the Chargers I'm going
to need and then what I'm bringing in my
carry-on so I'm first going to pack up
all my outfits and give you guys a
little idea of what that's going to look
like and then we'll move into you know
products and stuff so the clothes are
fast
along with my makeup bag and my shoes
and it's not leaving me much else room
we got like a little bit of space right
in here Oh in that section I'm just
going to pop all of my hot tools and
another really good tip if you guys
don't have one is I highly recommend
investing in a curling iron where you
can change the width of your like curls
so I'm going to tuck those into there
along with my blow dryer a range of a
few products like Tanner my razor hair
products and some perfume do recommend
that you wrap all that stuff in a
plastic bag so that if anything does
explode it doesn't get all over your
clothes the speaker I use just to get
ready and stuff like that my extra pair
of sunglasses since I know I'm not going
to wedding a plane tomorrow
last but not least ACMA carry-on in my
purse the first things first I usually
set aside what outfit I'm going to wear
on the plane which I actually did it's
just Shawn right there I'm going to wear
his vintage sweater that I got from
brandy melville some leggings just like
super casual and comfy and some sneakers
and for a carry-on I'm bringing my
knapsack so I can bring my laptop and my
headphones and stuff like that and then
I'm just bringing a small purse with me
as well and I'd like to keep any
valuables on my carry-on just in case
anything were to ever happen and it's
also really smart to pack a set of
clothes just in case anything and heaven
forbid knock on wood I don't even know
if that's good that anything would ever
happen to your suitcase so now I'm going
to pop my laptop my all of my chargers
and my camera chargers and my headphones
into my carry-on set my outfit over
there and my purse over there and then
probably hit the freakin a finally we're
closing in on 2:00 a.m. I have to be up
in three hours so I'm going to hit the
hay I hope you guys enjoyed this prep
for vacation or prep for a trip with me
last two days were so freaking crazy
that I hope I shown everything that I
wanted to in terms of prepping
purification but just in case I didn't

was just like Coachella edition and also
