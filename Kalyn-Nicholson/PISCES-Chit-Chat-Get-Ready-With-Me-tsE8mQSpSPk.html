before child is flat young we turn to
make goodnight problems hey guys what's
up and welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm doing another get
ready with me in the zodiac series and
today's is really exciting because it's
the Pisces and I am a Pisces funny
enough I'm actually filming this on my
birthday I figured why not you know of
all these to be inspired by Pisces when
touch is the day that I entered the
realm of existence in this Star
constellation really quick if you guys
aren't following me already be sure to
check out my Twitter my Instagram I'm
gonna pop them up right here along with
my blog and also I'm gonna link down
below I've already done a get ready with
me for both Capricorn and Aquarius we're
going an order and that is why today we
are doing the Pisces eat pisces dates
are from February 18th to March 20th I
believe we are a water sign hence my my
tattoo our symbol is the fish our planet
is Neptune but also Saturn hence why I
wore this shirt Our Strength's not to
you know toot my own horn being
compassionate artistic intuitive gentle
wise and musical but our weaknesses
being fearful sad and acting like a
victim or a martyr which I am guilty of
a time or two in terms of likes and
dislikes Pisces like being alone which
can confirm sleep music romance and
spiritual themes which is like honestly
my entire makeup this is a little bit
far out than what I would usually do for
it get ready with Mia but mind you if
you're watching this and you're like
holy crap her face looks like a unicorn
I stopped halfway through to get ready
with me to kind of pinpoint at what
point you could just throw on a lipstick
and go off and not have you know stars
on your face but that said if you guys
want to go all the way out with me then
you'll get to see how I went from that
point to this point so with that I won't
bore you guys any longer if you guys
want to see it my get ready with me at 4
Pisces hair makeup and outfit then just
keep watching play a southern spring on
Spotify alright here's your's
five playlists called a southern spring
we are rocking the Pisces mug because
this is a Pisces get ready with me so
I've been making French press coffee at
home and honestly this tastes like gold
I cannot drink from my Keurig anymore
because any time I make a cup of cured
coffee now it tastes like burnt almost
and this is just like sweet rich nectar
so as you guys heard I'm playing my
soaking springs my new playlist on
Spotify I've been uploading so many more
playlists than usual like I've always
kind of kept my spotify up-to-date I
post almost like two playlists week now
I playlists that are private 'add but
somehow you guys find like some of you
guys find your way in there I have so
many playlists that haven't even gone
live yet I've so many playlists that
just went live including this spring one
it's like a country spring playlist and
it's like all my favorite new country
music that is just come out also slowly
for the fact that Greg and I are going
to Nashville in today's and I'm so
excited will actually be there while you
guys are watching this video or while
this video goes live
you know insta stories and all that
stuff while we're there but anyway I'm
starting off with my bare minerals skin
longevity vital power infusion my skin
lately I think just from the air and
from how dry it has been and I've been
trying to drink a bit more water but
it's a struggle it's been kind of acting
out I have like bumps everywhere just
for that reason I want to start taking
better care of my skin so I'm gonna put
this on kind of like a base underneath I
think this might be something you're
supposed to put on at night but honestly
I'm feeling I'm feeling like a rebel
without a cause today this smells
amazing and my skin honestly means like
it needs a little you know wow that
actually feels so nice also I'm noticing
that my eyebrows are in desperate need
some cooking good looking girl it's like
it's so much work you pluck hair out of
our faces
we bleach it we rip it out of our skin
shave we have to get cramps like
hormonal changes mood swings not to
mention just the fact that like like we
get our hair done and stuff and we don't
do that for dudes like let's be real we
do it for us but but I was I'm ripping
hair out of the follicles right now I
really respect
to the effort that we women put in it
like it's its commitment okay so getting
started I'm gonna use my bare minerals
fare Pro firmance we're liquid
foundation this is still been like a
fave of mine I use it almost every day
i'm using the color 14 silk right now
okay so now for concealer I'm going in
with my Tarte shape tape contour
concealer this that's amazing it's like
my favorite my favorite concealer slowly
because I feel like it makes such a
difference in terms of the highlight
under my eye I like to do like I almost
put I feel like I maybe put too much on
do you see especially today like I woke
up today and I had real bad dark circles
and then another huge wave of mine has
been the Park Avenue princess by tarte
this palette is absolutely insane I know
that I used it in my Aquarius get ready
with me to which I've linked down below
if you guys haven't seen it
unfortunately because I am klutzy a I
dropped it and a bunch of them like fell
out and broke and now they're like not
in the right order if that makes sense I
think I'm gonna use halo because all of
the colors I'm using are very pink and
purple so I think I want to stay with a
pinky undertone look at me I'm like I
know what I'm talking about
and then to set the rest of my face i'm
using the Annabelle CC pressed powder
now that we've got like the bass going
we're about to get to the fun part so
I'm gonna go in with my tart busy gal
brows part of the double duty Beauty and
I have two different colors that I kind
of alternate wet taupe and medium brown
and when you open them they already come
with just like a little spooley so I'm
just gonna comb these through my brows
so I think what I want to do for this
look is something a little more like
mermaid ask slash whimsical slash dreamy
this one might not be as wearable as the
other ones but I really wanted to have
fun with this one going in with the tart
let palette it's this one here the
colors in it are absolutely perfect
they're all of that kind of lilac e
purple and taupe color I think I'm gonna
keep it in between these colors here
like the second row of colors
I don't know again I'm making this up as
I go so bear with me my birthday being
today also means that Justin Bieber's
birthday is tomorrow we were both born
in the 24-hour period in the same
province the whole jelena thing I I
don't know why I just he's so bad for
her but I can't help but love them as a
couple and they're I don't really follow
a lot personal lives of a lot of famous
people but Jelena I care
all righty then I might use Super Mom so
it's this one right here and put that in
my inner tear-duct
on like my actual I lied a little bit
and then I'm just gonna take this white
liner and line up my lower lash line
just kind of make my eyes pop a little
bit okay so I kind of wish I didn't just
go ahead and do my scare because I think
I want to add some eyeliner I just
remember that I have this it's the Kylie
Kylie liner and chameleon I haven't even
used this yet I bought it a few months
back and it's honestly I feel like it's
the perfect color because it's that kind
of movie purple in the meantime I'm
gonna contour my face and I'm just going
back in with a Park Avenue princess and
I wish I could tell you what you know
what shade I'm using the contour but
these are all mixed up now so yeah I
don't know I'm just using a brown
don't go looking for more of like a
wearable daytime look then definitely
maybe stop here a July product and you'd
be good to go for lips I'm going to be
using gelato by bite because it's like
that perfect wearable like purplish
color
distel it's like a perfect grayish toned
purple which I think goes so nice for
the Pisces look but I'm feeling a little
extra today for that reason I'm not done
contouring this could go one of two ways
you can either end up looking really
cool or could end up looking really bad
but we're gonna try it anyway I'm gonna
take best friend from this palette which
is this color right here and try and use
it as a bit of a contour just want to
see if this does what I think it will
okay so far so good I'm fighting with
both of these pallets so I guess this is
kind of good because it's giving a
high-end option and a low-end option
gets you faced glitter bomb and I'm also
playing around with the NYX I love you
so muchi or machi both of these have
glittery pinks and purples um I'm about
to either make myself look like a
majestic mermaid unicorn or I'm gonna
look like a kid that got into one of
those like dollar store glitter makeup
things but only time will tell
guys this just got delivered to my door
ring when we were about to get crazy
this is the prettiest thing I've ever
seen oh my god oh my god and it's from
the benefit team where am I gonna put
them what are we gonna name it okay to
be determined if you guys can think of a
name for our succulents leave it down
below okay where are we oh my god
so I feel like we need to add a bit of
like a blue tone something because this
is very pink and purple I might try this
one we shall see how this goes
so now I feel like I kind of want to add
almost like galactic stars if that makes
sense I don't even know where honestly
things are just getting out of hand now
this is like I don't know what I'm doing
but it's fun I kind of want to add the
purple and blue to my nose would that be
are we are we just like past the point
of caring how crazy this is now because
that kind of
okay so now that the makeups done I
think I'm going to kind of do like a
french braids into curly pigtails type
of thing one because I feel like that's
a little mermaidy too because I feel
like it's just gonna add to the Galactic
nest that is my face right now so I'm
just brushing my hair back and then I'm
gonna part it into to it down the middle
take a chunk from the very top and then
normally I like to leave out just a
little piece of hair and then taking
that first chunk of hair I separate it
into three pieces and then I vibrate
under instead of over so I just went
under and then on this top piece I just
add a chunk read under a gun add another
chunk of hair and then braid it out a
chunk of hair to the top grate it that
chunk here to the bottom and just
continue to do that normally all the way
down but I think I'm gonna stop at the
bottom of my scalp and turn it into a
ponytail
okay so now that all the hair has been
added on this side I'm gonna stop
braiding and ponytail it right there and
then basically just do the exact same
thing to the side so I'm going to do
from here is take a curling wand and
curl all the hair away from my face
on both sides so curling this side that
way and curling this side that way and
then that should that should pretty much
be it for the hair to save you guys from
being ultimately very bored I guess
we'll just we'll just this all turned
out better than I thought it was going
to just like the last few times and not
for the fun part let's skip forward to
the outfit so for the Pisces evidence
Pisces are known for being spiritual
artistic sleepy all of that stuff I
wanted the outfit to be comfy cozy but
also kind of tie in the movi purple
colors of the Pisces with all of that
being my inspiration the outfit ended up
turning into this kind of yoga slash
stay-at-home chill kind of outfit duo
from Lululemon it's like a movi purpley
kind of color they're high waisted
leggings and the matching sports bra and
then on top of that I just put this tie
around grey shirt that is from I believe
it's from urban Planet and finish the
look off with grey knitted reading socks
from indigo so it kind of has a bit of
that comfort slashed also a great
napping Oh fit for us
sleepy Pisces so that concludes today's
get ready with me for Pisces leave a
comment down below if you guys are a
fellow Pisces or what your zodiac sign
is or if you ended up liking this one
being a Pisces I feel like I'm qualified
