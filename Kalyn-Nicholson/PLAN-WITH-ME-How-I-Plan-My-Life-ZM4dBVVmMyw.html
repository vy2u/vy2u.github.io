Hey guys! And welcome back to my channel.
For today's video we are going to be doing the ninth day of Youtober
and it is going to be a Plan With Me video
which is something that you guys been requesting me to do
since I did one last year.
Some of my planning habits are still the same and some of them have actually changed quite a bit
But basically, if you ever wanted to know
how I go from planning videos to my  daily schedule,
my weekly schedule, my monthly schedule, my workouts,
and all of the in-between, then just keep watching.
♫
So starting out with how I like to plan my monthly schedule,
I have this dry-erase calendar that I actually got from Wal-mart quite a bit of time ago,
but I'll leave some in the description box if I can find them.
And I usually start, obviously, by filling in all the dates, and then I go ahead and
put in all the videos that are going to be uploaded that month so I can get
an overall view of how many videos are going to be going live
and obviously, because of Youtober, there was a LOT to fill out.
And then I like to choose when I'm going to be filming each video
and I like to do that in blue.  And then, in another color,
like orange, I'll fill in any.
you know, like trips I'm going to be going on, and then in pink,
I like to fill in when I'm going to be editing videos.
And then in green, I fill in my days off.  So it's just like
a super easy to do, like,  monthly overall.
And I just like doing this, because then I can see everything that I need to get done that month.
And then on the side, I put all the books I want to read by the end of the month.
So it's super easy and fast, but it just gives me an overview
and keeps me kind of organized so that I know how to plan
my Weekly schedule, which is what we'll be doing next.
So in my weekly schedule, I like to use this agenda here.
I toss and turn between 2 or 3 agendas, and I'm actually going to be
designing one soon for Koze.  You guys have been asking a lot of questions,
but I'll link this one down below.  I actually found it on Etsy.
And so I flip to the week that I'm going to
be planning for, and the thing I like about this one,
is it has 2 sides for each day.
So I tend to fill in all of my work-related things
on the right, so like you'll see here- those are all my work-related tasks, or to-dos.
And then on the left, I keep all of like,
my life and social.
So any, you know, um,
like groceries and cleaning and things like that, would go on the left side.
And then, any videos, e-mails, or Koze work
would go on the right side.  And then, once that's all filled in,
I'll usually plan out, you know,
my workouts and things like that.  For this week, I was actually going to be going on a trip, so I
filled in a lot of the stuff that I was going to do on the trip, including the
workouts that I wanted to get done, and the videos I wanted to film and edit.
And then in the big section
towards the bottom of the page, I like to keep just overall weekly tasks
that don't really have to be planned on specific days
and planning out my Instagram and things like that.  So that's pretty much
an overview of how I plan my week and then usually
once that's done, I'll go ahead and
input anything that I need to do on my phone
that I want it to remind me for; so you know, flights
or like specific things that I have to remember at an exact time,
I'll put in my calendar so that I have an
alert that goes off on my phone, because I tend to be (laugh) a little bit forgetful.
So the next, you guys
have seen this notebook before,
but this is just, like my overall lifestyle notebook
I put all types of lists and planning in here
from grocery lists to my workout plan for the week.
Um, I'll even plan things like videos,
plan trips... I'll plan, like Youtober,
I put all of my Youtober videos in this book.
This book is just like an overall lifestyle.  Anything that you ever need to like,
write down or get out of your head or put in list form,
I use this book.  And like you can see I'm doing here,
I'm planning out my workout schedule for the week.  Um, and then I'll like
highlight when things are complete.  This is just literally anything you could possibly
want to plan goes in this notebook
and then, I have a secondary notebook that matches it , and both are
from Indigo, but this is my video planning notebook.
And I get commonly asked
how I plan out videos, so you guys are gonna get a good idea here.
I like to flip to an empty page.
At the top I'll put the title of what the video is gonna be or
like a temporary title.  And then, I'll usually fill out
you know, what I need to do thumbnail wise,
I'll plan out how I'm gonna have the thumbnail, the intro,
the music that I'm going to use so that  it's easy to fill out the description box.
And then I'll just fill out the core of the actual video,
like what i'm going to be including, what I'm going to be talking about, if there are certain, like
things I need to remember, or if it's more of like
a morning routine then I'll fill out exactly each shot I want to get
so that's just like an overview of how I plan my videos and then at the top,
I'll put filmed, edited, and uploaded.
So that is it.  That is like an overall of how I plan everything
from workouts to videos to weeks to months.
And I'll have the agendas, materials, dry-erase calendars, and all of the stuff pretty much that I use.
♫
So that is it for my Plan With Me video.  I hope you guys enjoyed.  If you guys have any sort of
planning routine or tips, be sure to leave them down below, because I'm always
looking to kind of, you know,
build upon the system that I have going.  So definitely
leave any tips or tricks that you guys use down below .  And aside rom that,
I hope you guys enjoyed today's Youtober video
and I will see you guys all in tomorrow's.  Bye guys!
