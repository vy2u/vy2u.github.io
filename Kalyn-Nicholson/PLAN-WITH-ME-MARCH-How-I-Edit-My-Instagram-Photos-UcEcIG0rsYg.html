my channel for today's video I am doing
a plan with me for March because as
promised we're doing one of these every
single month for today's video I'm
drinking out of the yellow monk because
I'm not gonna lie this week has been
testing me and so I just felt like it
was a yellow mug kind of day I needed
that little bit of pick-me-up you know
recently I've been getting really into
like affirmations and meditations and
all that stuff and like setting your
intention for the day and I made my
intention like overall this week to just
go with the flow and breathe through
things and just let whatever comes comes
and whatever goes goes I feel like the
universe is really testing my intention
it's it's seeing how serious I really am
about it
like for instance I filmed this video
already and lost all the footage but
here we are filming it again and you
know why I'm still happy about it
because I'd much rather be sitting here
filming this video then you know being
somewhere else really quick if you guys
aren't following me already be sure to
follow my Twitter my Instagram I'm gonna
pop it right here on the screen as well
as link the plan with me for both
January and February down below January
was very overall kind of like 2018 and
February was more trying at a bullet
journal for the first time which I have
updates and ultimately if you guys want
to plan with me for March then just keep
watching all right guys let's get
color-coded an extra nerdy first of all
how are we already leaning into March I
swear to God I know I say this every
year but I feel like 2018 like it's
lying already we are already on the
third plan with me of this year anyway
and some filming needs every single
month I kind of want to highlight
different section of my plane with Me's
for every single video because one I
don't want them to be all the same and
two I just feel like it's a cool way to
kind of keep these fresh and fun and so
for March I kind of wanted to share with
you guys not just how I plan on you know
like my dry race and stuff like that but
also what I do to kind of plan things on
my phone my phone has become a huge
asset when it comes to planning things
in staying or
organize even just like the notes' guys
I just need to show you really quick we
don't need a diamond to it in this video
but I can dive into it in other videos I
make a note about everything like I have
so many notes dreams that I've had video
ideas I've done research on things I
have lists I bucket lists restaurants in
Toronto I want to try movies to watch
just like everything you could possibly
write a list or a note about I put in my
phone because it's on me at all times so
first things first every single month I
kind of like to change up my background
I'm like on my phone and on my home page
because I feel like we are visual
creatures and so keeping the backgrounds
on your phone or keeping the screen
savers on your phone or so it's
something that you're gonna see every
day and so I think if it's something
that makes you feel good or like
inspired or happy then I mean you know
it can't hurt
I just want only hard it which I will
leave a link to my wii heart it down
below but I took two of my most recent
favorite hearts one of them being this
like you know a little hippie van and
making that the background when you open
up my phone and then I took this photo
which I want to say is Lake Louise I
could be wrong but I'm pretty sure
that's in Canada and I've been itching
to get out west so maybe you know law of
attraction all that stuff but I decided
to make that one the background on my
actual phone because also it's just the
color scheme that I've been kind of
feeling lately both photos are this
makes me feel super calm and the hippie
van makes me want to go on adventures
we're just hoping to manifest all those
things and then in terms of my actual
phone case I've been getting a lot of
questions about this so I've decided to
just kind of throw it in this video this
is from a company called print your pet
I did not do any sort of like connection
or collaboration with them I honestly
just bought it I will forewarn you guys
it took a pretty decent amount of time
from buying it to actually getting it I
bought it back in like November and I
think it came close to Christmas
honestly this thing is the most amazing
thing in the world and I have no regrets
look at this you ready it's literally
him and then as I mentioned before I
like to use my notes to plan pretty much
anything I need to for the week at the
top I like to keep all of my kind of
this week notes and so I'll open up a
note on my phone and then at the very
top I just like to kind of plan out what
meals I want to eat so what I've been
doing
I used to be super in to meal prepping
but I've decided to kind of go back to
food prepping because it just works
better with my lifestyle so all I do is
kind of give myself two options for
breakfast lunch dinner and then snacks
and then I pick up all the ingredients
to kind of be able to make both of those
things so that one I'm not eating the
same thing every day and two I still
have some sort of option if I want to
make this or make that and then from
there I kind of just go look at what I
have in my fridge in my cupboards and
see what I still need to pick up to be
able to make all of those meals happen a
lot of the time I already have a lot of
the things that I need like bananas or
rice or like vegetables or tofu and so
that way if there's anything I'm kind of
craving whether it be unhealthy or
healthy I can try and find a way to make
a vegan healthy version of it so that's
how I kind of plan out my grocery list
on my phone and then on top of that
another huge request I've been getting
from you guys is to go into how I've
been editing my Instagram photos so I
decided to throw that in this video give
the people what they want you know what
I mean recently shot some photos with my
sister and I used them for a blog post
which will already have gone live after
this video goes up so I will leave a
link to that down below too but I'm just
gonna put that photo into vsco cam and
show you guys how I've been editing my
photos once I upload a photo and I kind
of align it and crop it just to make
sure it's you know looking good I will
add hb2 as per usual that has never
changed and I will usually turn up the
exposure a little bit and then second I
go to shadows and I put it up anywhere
between five and six then I'll sometimes
adjust the highlights as well go into
the contrast
I'll change up the temperature I always
turn the temperature down to give it a
bit of a blue hue and then I'll turn the
tint up which gives it that pinky vibe
so it was always kind of sitting
somewhere between blue pink and purple
I'll then adjust the skin tone which
will basically just turn the color of
your skin a little bit more green or a
little bit more red sometimes I'll need
to turn it a bit more green depending on
the lighting when the photo was taken
and sometimes I need to turn it a bit
more red and then last but not least
I'll add a tiny bit of green like just a
little bit not a lot I mean it depends
on the day but not a lot I'll sometimes
then throw it in to facetune and whiten
it if it seems a little too yellow and
highlight a couple areas with the
details tool but aside from that that's
usually all I do then I use
this is kind of how I plan out my
Instagram and this is also how I plan
out promo for videos and blogs and
things like that
I will plop the photo in the grid where
I want it to be uploaded kinda have a
bit of a formula when I upload the
Instagram where I'll be in the photo and
then out of the photo I don't know if
you've ever noticed that before but I've
been doing it for a very long time now
so then my Instagram kind of has a bit
of a pattern so that's why I really
enjoy using Onam because I can plan
everything out to make sure everything
kind of stays within that rhythm I love
I love photography okay so I have a lot
of fun editing photos and kind of making
everything look you know seamless and so
I get super geeky over that stuff so I
love being able to pop it in see how
it's gonna look on my feet before
uploading it and then also coming up
with captions for instance I put the
photo that we just edited in I don't
even know if I'm gonna post this photo
like per se but just to give you guys an
example and then I just write out the
caption or sometimes you know I'll have
like a photo and I'll just be feeling
some type of way and I just want to get
it out even if I'm not ready to post it
yet I know that I want to kind of say
something so I'll write it out and have
it ready to go for whatever it is time
to upload it I get really geeky and
nerdy over that kind of stuff and I also
totally value the people that just post
live like whenever something happens
they post it right away and I think that
that is really cool too ever floats your
boat
whatever tickles your fancy whenever
brews your coffee I like that one and so
that concludes the planning I needed to
do on my phone slash how I edit my
Instagram photos
next I'm gonna move on to the good old
dry race guys I don't know if you can
tell you probably can't but I upgraded
because my dry race is something that I
actually need to have up at all times
I've tried like tucking it away because
it's not the prettiest thing to look at
it's something that I reference so many
times when I'm on the phone when I'm
doing emails I just need it on my desk
so that I'm seeing kind of my month of a
glance I wanted something that was a
little bit more aesthetically pleasing
because I my priorities in life are out
of whack okay I'll leave the link to it
down below if you guys are needing a dry
erase board but this one's just like
white and black and plain I pretty much
fill this out generally the same I like
to fill in first I need trips that I'm
going on just to make sure I've punched
those out and then after that out put in
all of my upload videos like what videos
are going up and what day a K Sundays
and Wednesdays then I'll go into what
days I write my blog post what days I'm
gonna be filming videos what days and
movie editing videos and within the next
few weeks I'm gonna have to start adding
to this what I'm gonna be uploading my
podcasts because that's something that's
actually coming super soon so basically
this is an overview of all the upload
things off to the side I just keep a
very brief kind of what I work on which
day from Monday to Sunday and then I
just write down what I'm currently
reading because again I think we're
visual people and so I feel like seeing
that it makes me want to finish it so
that I can erase it and put the next
book up and all that fun stuff
oh and then I completely forgot at the
very top - I like to keep my work out
Sally and I just check off each time I
work out because I'm still doing the $5
thing I just actually used more than I
actually earned on a new pair of running
shoes and I'm very excited to use the
thrown out mini so I have to take a few
days off of running which I think it's
also partly why I'm having such a weird
week now I'm just working up a new tally
because I want to get a new running
jacket for the spring but anyway I'm
just continuing to fill your brains with
fluff of things that you guys probably
didn't really care to know
so you guys might be wondering am I
still using the bullet journal have I
moved back to the planner and honestly
guys I love both I feel like I can't
really commit to one of the other yet so
I'm still playing around with both I
know it might seem kind of
counterproductive to be using two
different things with playing around
with the bullet journal and still using
my planner it's keeping me more on par
with the amount of things that I'm
trying to do and accomplish that I've
ever been before so I've just been
playing around with it I ended up loving
the habit tracker that I made in the
life makeover video and this has been my
favorite thing in the world because a
lot of these habits are things that I
don't want to have to write down in my
actual planner itself like reading a
chapter of both books I'm reading or
doing 15 minutes of cleaning every
single day or flossing like those are
things that I'm not gonna write in my
day planner but there are things that I
can use in my habit tracker and so I
feel like the combination of those two
have been my I don't know my bread and
butter so I ended up making a new habit
tracker completely for the month of
March slowly because I also wanted to
share with you guys kind of how I made
the last one since I didn't really dive
too much into detail so it just took the
grid mapped out 31 days across to make
sure that there's a square for every
single day and then depending on how
many habits you want to track that's how
many squares you're gonna want to go
down and then once that's done at the
top I just wrote March habit tracker and
then all of my habits are eight hours of
sleep reading every day I'm meditating
every day working out yoga writing a 15
minutes of cleaning art research going
for two walks a K taking Bentley for two
walks breaking on Kosar my podcasts
working on capture and working outside
of my home okay like going to a cafe or
the library eating healthy making sure I
get my 10 K steps cooking at home
everyday crossing off all of my daily
goals which means crossing everything
off for the day and my planner whether
or not I feel like I had a good day like
if it's like if I was just in a happy
mood that day then I'll fill in the
square and then washing my face and
makeup off at the end of the day because
I've been getting into a really bad
habit of just using face wipes and musk
in my skins feeling it
then on the side I just put a savings
plan because I hate
at the beginning of this year a big goal
of mine right now is to buy a condo I
need to stop talking about it and
actually start planning it so I kind of
created a savings plan of how much money
I want to save by the end of this mine
you could make this anything from
working on a book working on a big
project learning an instrument reading a
book but basically I just put like my
main goal for the month of March which
is my savings plan so that's a little
habit tracker that I decided to make a
little how-to on how you guys can make
one in your bolat journals if you'd like
but aside from that that's all I'm using
my bullet journal for for this month and
instead I'm gonna be using my planner to
keep track of the more bigger tasks that
I need to do on a day to day basis in
terms of how I use my weekly planner
things haven't changed too much
I still use the left side for my
lifestyle or like non-work-related
things and the right side for things
that I have to do that I consider more
work-related it's on the left side it's
always walking Bentley working out
meditating and doing yoga those are the
big lifestyle things that I try and
accomplish every day appointments or if
I'm meeting a friend for lunch or if I
have something to do that night
sometimes I'll even write down like
bachelor and tacos because watching The
Bachelor making tacos is it's a gift and
sometimes you need to plan your gifts so
then on the right side I map out what
I'm doing for work every single day kind
of has a different theme for me when it
comes to working I don't have like a
boss telling me that I need to get
things done so I have to kind of be my
own boss and my own manager in a lot of
ways you guys ever want me to do like a
workweek vlog and bring you guys with me
as I work throughout the week I can
totally do that it might be boring but I
most certainly can but that said like
for things like Monday I work on blog
posts I do manager mode which is doing
emails and appointments and stuff and
then I usually edit if I can
keeping in mind too this is also going
to be the week that I'm leaving so
there's a few days that I ended up
having to kind of square off in
highlighter these are not normal days I
am NOT here but in general I did write
down a few things that I might be doing
while I'm away for instance working out
there's still gonna be videos goin alive
while I'm away and stuff so I want to
make sure I'm still posting my socials
and things like that but ultimately this
would look a little different if I
obviously wasn't on trip one of my
favorite things ever about these
planners is the big giant section
second page what I like to do in there
is I put it into a three part grid I
make the bigger one overall to dues for
that week sometimes they'll be things in
there like booked appointment and then I
put 8:00 to buy and they're all right
down like if I need to get groceries if
I need to get certain things for videos
but then I also like to keep my budget
at the top of that section and then
finally again we talked about this in
the February plan with me but I like to
keep a little section of accomplished so
if there's anything that I feel like I
really did well with or accomplished
that week or just feel really proud
about I kind of write that down there
give myself those warm fuzzies little
pat on the back which sounds corny but
those little positive reinforcements or
actually I feel like they make a big
difference on your mindset you
accomplish this and I'm proud of you
even though you was me so with that thus
concludes of my plan with me for March a
slash my how I've been editing my
Instagram photos I hope you guys enjoyed
today's video if you guys have any
requests or the next plan with me
there's more things you want to see on
my phone more things you want to see
with the planners the bullet journals or
anything like that then definitely let
me know and I will make sure to try my
best to get it in there and aside from
that I love you guys Emunah back thank
you guys so much for planning with me
for March and I guess I'll just you know
see you guys all in sunday's video bye
