want to switch lanes which it takes me
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video
I am doing the April planned with me
this is the fourth plan with me this
year guys what the hell is happening
every single time I sit down to film a
plan with me I'm kind of flabbergasted
that a month has passed already since
the last time I sat down film one if you
guys haven't seen my past plan with me
I've done everything from planning out
2018 my morals my goals my resolutions
in February I think we tried bullet
journaling in March I showed you guys
how I plan things on my phone and now
for April I like to keep all these plan
with meas a little bit different and
this one's really cool because for the
month of April I've challenged myself to
travel for a month kind of tying in to
the January plan with me something that
I've really ingrained to my everyday
morning routine is reading and it's
something that I have fallen in love
with I don't think I've missed a day of
reading and like in months when I
grabbed on to Eat Pray Love you knew
this was gonna happen don't read Eat
Pray Love if you don't want to get the
travel bug because it'll bite you so
dang hard and in general I think after
winter I always kind of want to get out
because I'm a little restless really
wanted to challenge myself to break out
of my comfort zone and just go travel
lately my anxiety has been so good this
is also just a huge test to myself to
see how I do with being so pulled out of
my comfort zone and so pulled out of my
daily routine and just have to kind of
you know adventure and take the risk
explore a little bit and play with life
that's what I feel like doing right now
so while Eat Pray Love is obviously
eating praying and loving I decided that
for my video a love month of April my
three destinations are gonna be beach
dance elephants the first trip I'm going
on is a road trip with Bethany we're
gonna drive down to both South Carolina
and Florida we're gonna hit the beach
I'm gonna do some yoga I'm gonna get
some reading done figure out some life
questions on
you know I also just saw a bike and I'm
gonna hook it up to the back of my Jeep
throw our stuff in the car and just
drive we're just gonna drive south we're
gonna get to some warmer temperatures
we're gonna explore we're gonna hang out
for a bit and then we're gonna come back
the second trip / dance portion of my
mini Eat Pray Love is Coachella I'm
going to be going to Coachella with one
of my best friends I'm going with
Christine it's going to be such a good
weekend and then after Coachella I'm
topping off the month with my own solo
bucket list scratching something off by
heading to Thailand going to pet an
elephant and then I go see some
elephants I'm gonna go you know see the
big buddha some just like soul-searching
you know sounds so lame but i'm
literally getting goose bumps right now
thinking about even just saying thailand
i can't stop we need to keep going so
this time with me is going to be planned
with me for a month of traveling I
obviously have a lot of preparations I
have a lot of things I need to make sure
I have an order I'm gonna share with you
guys a mini pack with me for the road
trip in this because that's the first
trip and we leave this weekend just like
all my travel tips and tricks all the
things I like to do before I travel to
plan all of that fun stuff is gonna be
in this video
so with that grab a drink I'm currently
drinking water but I'm gonna brew myself
a coffee for the dry race and the actual
packing portion of this video take a
seat and let's let's uh plan for months
of traveling
so the first farmer is obviously filling
out my dry race this is always a go to
no matter what I'm planning because it
gives me an overview look at the month
which is obviously super important this
month since there's gonna be so much
coming and going I want to fill in when
I'm gonna be away what days I'm gonna be
on what trips and then that is an
obvious look at okay so I'm not gonna be
home during that time so the things that
I'm able to get done are going to
obviously be a little bit more minimal
or the things I'm able to plan are a bit
more minimal thing I love about travel
is that you almost kind of have to go
with the flow like you can't plan too
much because you're exploring when
you're adventuring so first things first
I want to know what days I'm gone then I
need to know what days I'm uploading for
my everyday you know schedule luckily
for me I can work while I travel I'm
still gonna have to get some work done
on these trips which is totally fine
with me because I love work so I need to
fill out what days things are gonna get
uploaded so then I can look at my
schedule and say okay now what days do I
need to film them edit them have those
things up and ready to go so that I'm
not stressing about it along the way I
now have a good idea of what I need to
get done before I leave what I need to
get done while I'm away and what days
I'm going on what days I'm actually here
which leads me to part number two and
that's actually playing so I'm not gonna
go through every single trip and planet
with you guys but to give you guys an
example I'll play my road trip with you
right here right now
will do
so first things first I obviously need
to figure out where I'm going so when I
was looking at the route down towards
Florida I didn't have a necessary
destination of mine I just wanted to see
how far it was how far I was willing to
drive and where I wanted to go so along
the way I noticed that Charleston South
Carolina was on that route I also
recently finished reading safe-haven and
Nicholas Sparks he's one of my favorite
authors and all of his books always tend
to kind of take place around North
Carolina or South Carolina so I decided
that I wanted to stop in South Carolina
because that was going to be one she's
cutting down the amount of time I'd be
driving otherwise to drive to Florida is
like 22 hours which is way too crazy and
to I get to explore two places rather
than one or the dates that I'm gone I'm
gonna stay in South Carolina for two
nights and stay in Florida for two
nights which gives me the dates of my
entire road trip after that I looked at
my places to stay
found some Airbnb and then booked those
right after and then I did a bit of
research for both Charleston and Jensen
Beach and lift up some fun things that I
want to do on the time that I have there
comes a time where I'm like okay now
what like no what do I want to do I'll
have like a little list of things to do
in those areas this is like a good
reference point while I'm traveling
because I'm also gonna bring this
notebook with me from there I'm gonna
need to know what we'll need while we're
there this is almost like the pre prep
to the packing so I make a list of all
of the things that I know I want to have
while I'm away or I know I'm gonna need
blow them away and things that I must
pack and that includes just even stuff
for Bentley because obviously this is
Bentley's first puppy adventure so I
need to make sure that I'm prepared for
Bentley I need to make sure I'm prepared
for myself I need to make sure that
there's things that I'm packing there's
things that I'm buying to pack
I just bought a bike rack I need to like
basically put that on like little things
that I need to pack and then after that
I make a list of to dues things that
need to get done before the day of the
trip or else I'm gonna be unprepared
making sure I know how to mount my bike
on my Jeep making sure I have the proper
documents to cross the border with
Bentley
things like that - just make sure that
I'm fully prepped and prepared and that
no anxiety will trickle its way in the
night before and I'm suddenly freaking
out and feeling like I don't have
everything together I print out any
important papers slip them in a folder
and then last but not least I top
everything off by making sure I have a
playlist which I will pop down below the
playlist that I've made for the beach or
road trip portion Travel of April is my
fireflies in spring playlist that is the
playlist that I made for the road trip
and I will link it down below and then
also I like to make sure that I have
downloaded my audiobooks so I've
actually partnered with audible for this
video I find when I travel I love using
audiobooks especially for driving I'm
not gonna be able to physically read but
it's a long extensive time that I'm
gonna be on the road there's two days in
particular where I'm driving up to 15
hours and so to break up that time I
like to download audiobooks while I'm
traveling and driving and just give
myself something to listen to that isn't
just music so I went ahead and
downloaded two different books I
downloaded the power of now because I'm
currently reading that book right now
and I know that I'm still gonna be
reading it by this weekend so I wanted
to have it on my phone finish it off
while driving but then I ended up
downloading another book that is a new
fiction because I'm really close to
finishing Eat Pray Love so I downloaded
how to fall in love with a man who lives
in a bush it's by Emma Abrahamson and I
downloaded it because I actually really
liked just the sound of the storyline
and I feel like it would be a little bit
fun and springy and mindless perfect for
a road trip so those are the two
audiobooks I'm going to be listening to
on my way but I mean audible has like an
enormous amount of audiobook plus if you
ever decide to cancel your membership
you actually get to keep all your
audiobooks after which is pretty dope so
if you guys actually want to try audible
and get a free audiobook with a 30-day
trial then head to audible.com slash
Cailin where you will get to try it out
for 30 days see if it's your thing or
you can text Cailin to 500x500 I will
leave all the details to that down below
if you guys are looking at to try some
audiobook I feel like I might have to
download one or two more or the trip
comes depending on where I'm at with the
power of now because it is like it's
literally it's gonna be like almost 40
hours of driving guys
I have I have a lot that's a lot of time
to get some reading done especially
while driving my playlists can only take
me so so far for so long you know and so
once all of that is said and done the
last and final thing to do when it comes
to planning for some travel is packing
my new heart soldiers came in of bath
and Bodyworks candles now moving on to
summer boardwalk was just burning
lavender marshmallow highly recommend
both first thing that I'm gonna do and
the first thing that I always do when
I'm packing for any sort of trip is pull
up my packing checklist I ended up
reposting my packing checklist to my
blog it's just like an easy-to-follow
guide that you can pretty much use the
matter where you're traveling
I mean mind you obviously off do the
things that you don't need like if
you're going somewhere that's cold you
would obviously skip over bathing suit
and things like that it just gives you
like an overall view of all of the
things that you might need to pack when
going anywhere it's a leave a link to it
down below first place I'm going is
Charleston so the next thing I like to
do is check the weather for I'm going so
that I know to pack things that are
according to the weather so the days of
them there it's roughly 23 degrees
getting this coldest 14 degrees so
that's pretty onion I definitely want to
pack a little bit warmer for Charleston
and then as for Jensen Beach Florida is
a little warmer it's coming up as 30
degrees with a low of 17 or 18 degrees I
can definitely pack warmer for that the
other thing as that came in that I'm so
excited to pack but also pigs belly and
I up backpacks for our road trip just
take a second guys this is the cutest
thing I wish it was a little smaller I
honestly thought it was going to be but
look at Bethenny's backpack got a lot of
dogs on it and it's funny because he's
part wiener dog so this is the backpack
I need to pack up for definitely it's
also gonna be good even just for like
when we go biking and like around the
city like when we're exploring this is a
perfect size for just the stuff that I'm
going to need to carry with me so now
gonna use my packing checklist and
knowing the weather I'm gonna go in
order of clothing then beauty and
toiletries and then finish everything
off with tech stuff and then my like
personal bag which will be this bag here
this will have like my laptop and things
like that so that's the order I'm going
to go ahead and pack in without boring
bodies I'm going to shoot it overhead
and put all the text overlay so you guys
can see the stuff as I'm packing it a
little ways tips and tricks that I like
to use I'm packing I've been spending
enough time couple lemon balm aside I'll
go to sitting on my mind spend on red
wine
I've been sitting never ages okay
pinning out the pages how'd it get so
faded how'd I get so faded
Nina if you love me how do never
call the crimson
one or two
this is how it ends I feel the chemicals
burn in my bloodstream fading out again
a few chemicals burned in my bloodstream
so tell me let it kick fit
I've been looking for love thought I'd
finally win a boat Oh God make me
another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow Lord
forgive me for the things I've done I
was never meant for no one and I saw
Scott disappoint
brokenhearted life this is how
few chemicals burn in my bloodstream
sailing out
I feel the chemicals
so that sums up you know the packing
portion there's a few things that I
obviously left out like my camera and a
few just a couple of other things
because I don't have to leave for a few
days the only other thing I think I left
out was my makeup I'm gonna try and not
use any heat on my hair the whole week
while I'm gone so I'm basically just
gonna do braids and then let my braids
that crank it up and just pull back my
bangs kind of like at the beginning of
this video and then aside from that the
only other thing I didn't show was I
still have to pack an outfit for Easter
since I'm going to Easter first in my
hometown and then leaving from my
hometown so those are the only two
things that I didn't share with you guys
and of course you know like my bike and
actually packing up the Jeep but those
are things that I'll put on like my
insta story or some things when we leave
I'm so excited
how cute is Bentley's bag this is this
kills me like I'm also just so excited
for Bentley to have a little adventure
it also is tying in just before his
fifth birthday so I'm gonna consider
this a little bit of like a birthday
trip for Bentley so I'm really excited
to just explore with him I'll get some
reading done get some work done and just
bike and eat try out some warmer
temperatures because it's still a little
cold here in Toronto there you guys have
it I hope you guys enjoyed planning with
me for a month of travel it's going to
be a hectic month
I definitely feel more prepped and
planned now that we've done all of this
but now that it's coming up I still have
a lot to do before I leave so it's gonna
be a nice little relaxing getaway once
it actually comes to leave a comment
down below if you could travel anywhere
in the world right now
where would you guys go and also keep
watch because obviously there's gonna be
vlogs coming from all of these trips so
definitely look forward to that and
aside from that I love you guys to the
moon and back I hope you guys are having
an amazing diet and I'll see you guys
all in my next video which will be
Sunday which I'll already be gone then
