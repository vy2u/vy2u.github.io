my channel for today's video it is the
28th is it probably J it is today is
actually the 28th day of you to come
right for today's video I'm gonna doing
a pack with me video considering those
of you guys might know already
after youtuber ends Greg and I are
heading off to Mexico which I am so
freaking excited for we've been
literally counting this down for so long
we were initially gonna book something
in September but things just got way too
crazy so we pushed it to November I was
so excited the amount of times that the
chant Pina Colada has left my mouth in
the last two weeks of editing so since
it's been so long since I've done it
like an updated pack with me video I
wanted to do like a full in-depth pack
with me for vacation especially since
this is kind of early in the vacation
season since we're heading into winter
this will be up for all of you guys
going on spring break or any Christmas
trips things like that going home for
Thanksgiving so without further ado if
you guys want to pack with me for
vacation then just keep watching
okay feel like this video is so
laid-back because we're just like
casually chillin in my closet and I'm
wearing pajamas like actual full-on
pajamas but the first thing I like to do
when it comes to packing is I'll throw
on PJs like this like just a big baggy
t-shirt and some shorts because I like
to try on everything before I pack it so
you guys will also get to see everything
I'm bringing to Mexico so first things
first I put on comfy clothes and I
sometimes I'll even go as far as making
sure that like my hair is curled just so
I can see the outfits with curl hair I
know that sounds crazy when you think
you look good it you feel good and
heading off to vacation you kind of want
to feel good so I curled my hair really
quick so I get like a whole idea of what
I'm packing you know for what vibe I'm
going for each day I take this stuff
away too seriously
I'm well aware the next thing I like to
do is usually throw on a playlist for
whatever trip I'm going on I have a ton
of like private playlists on my Spotify
that I have for all the trips that I've
been on so I made one specifically for
this so I thought that I want to trying
everything on and then the next step is
to section everything off I'm going to
be going through my ultimate packing
checklist that I reloaded to tumblr
recently and it's completely updated so
I will link that down below but that's
how I'm going to be going through
everything to section it all off on the
floor before it even touches my suitcase
I guess we shall begin
so now that I've gone through each and
every section I basically sectioned off
all the clothes that I wanted to wear
for the whole trip
aside from the dresses category and like
the tops and bottoms category where I
gave multiple options so that now I can
try them on and see what I like best and
try and slim down what I actually picked
ago the amount of times that I didn't
try things on when I go on trips get
there and hate the way it looked on me
and wish I had brought in something else
happens to me every single time so I
started trying on my clothes before
packing them and then whenever I went on
trips I knew exactly what I was gonna be
wearing and plus - it helps me come up
with kind of like themes and outfits
like it sounds lame but I was like who
like everything in this - Scott like a
bit more of an edgy vibe so I'd go for
like an edgy vibe the whole trip or
whatever Wow I am like every time I
believe MIT these things - you guys I'm
in awe of how ridiculously nerdy this is
it's just fun it's so much fun so now
I'm going to try on all the outfits that
I've picked up for Mexico and I'm gonna
share them with you guys be sure to
leave a comment down below what you guys
favorites are let's do it
so normally if I'm going on a week
vacation I'll usually bring about three
bathing suits and three bathing suit
cover-ups a lot of the stuff that I'm
gonna be showing you guys I picked up a
long time ago but if I can find links to
anything I will put them down below but
for starters I tried on my three bathing
suits three bathing suit cover-ups
unpacked a hat to go with it for all of
the you know like water activities and
then from there I like to pack three to
four tops making sure that one of the
tops like this white one can go with all
of my bottoms and then I wear one pair
of bottoms that goes with all the tops
so these are the two pieces that could
go with all the other tops and bottoms
and then I try on all the bottoms with
that one top that's meant to go with all
of the bottoms and that just kind of
makes it so that you can double up on
all of your outfits and mix-and-match
and then I usually pack about three to
four dresses and robbers so then I tried
those on and packed those up too
so then once I've tried all of the
necessities on I go ahead and pack them
all into my suitcase and then used a
little like sheer cover-ups to kind of
section them off and then once I clip
those into place I tuck things in to the
sides to keep everything together so
I'll usually bring one pair of nice
shoes or wedges a pair of flip-flops a
pair of sandals then I squish all of my
bathing suits into the one side of my
bathing suit cover-ups and then I see
how much room I have left over to pack
things like hats slippers hot tools I'll
make sure that my makeup bag fits in
here and with any leftover space I'll
put maybe a sweater or two but I try and
leave a tiny bit of space in case
there's anything I want to bring back
and then on the other side in the wet
section of my suitcase I put all of my
products in case anything explodes it
kind of keeps it concealed in there and
then in the netting one I usually put
chargers notebooks and basically
anything else that doesn't fit my super
okay so once I've tried on all my
outfits I usually then go ahead and pack
them all into my suitcase going in order
of everything on my checklist
like I mentioned I'll leave the
checklist down below I don't actually
leave for a few more days so things like
shampoo and conditioner and a few of my
necessities I'm not gonna pack right now
because I'll pack those the night before
but I basically pack everything I can or
I make sure like even my makeup bag I'm
gonna take it back out after but I like
to pack it in just so I know that I have
space for it and then at the end once I
see how much room I have leftover I'll
throw in any like additional outfits
that I scrapped at first or if I want to
bring an extra set of comfy clothes
because I just feel like anywhere you go
no matter how hot it is you can never go
wrong with having like a pair of
sweatpants or like comfy sweats to chill
in you know so my suitcase is officially
packed and I'm actually very pleased
with all the opens that I have picked up
for this one so I'm gonna go ahead and
pack it carry on as if it's the night
before just to show you guys what is
actually in my carry-on I feel like your
carry-on can make or break your flight
you know you can either have a bomb
flight and feel like it went by so fast
or it ends up being one of those flights
where you had nothing to do and then
every single time you check the clock
it's only been like three minutes this
all boils down to what is inside your
carry-on
so lazy
just
so there you have it that is how I pack
for vacation and everything I am packing
for this vacation let me know if you
guys actually enjoyed this video and I
can do them for other trips that I go on
to like non-tropical trips or if I go to
Europe next year if you guys want more
themed pack with me videos like this
where it's a little bit more vlog style
and I'm sharing with you guys like more
specifically when I pack not just like
how I pack then definitely let me know
down below and other than that I love
you guys to them in the back I hope you
