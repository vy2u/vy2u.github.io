realized now that I only have two very
very small suitcases and I have no idea
what to pack
hey guys and welcome to my life Monday
you're watching this time probably in
California right now which is so
freaking exciting I can't even fathom it
right at this moment so it is 1109 and I
have so much to still get done today
woke up at 6:00 a.m. this morning oh my
god ask me how happy I am to be awake at
this rate at this second still way too
early I did wake up like this actually
I never see
the tempter and I was looking for it is
the only way come on
again
yeah so I went for a run actually did a
workout on the bench at the park as well
but I didn't film accident have my
camera with me so then I came home I had
a quick shower okay so I just got out of
the shower I'm gonna go through really
quickly like a what's in my shower for
you guys because I feel like that's
something I've never shown you guys
before so this is a waterproof case that
I got off of Amazon it is like a
must-have for my shower
I love blasting music while I'm
showering so I got this on Amazon I'll
leave a link down below if I can find it
but this is so crucial and then as for
shampoo and conditioner I'm still using
might resume reverse beautiful volume
and basically it's just like you use the
conditioner first in the shampoo second
which kind of gets like the weight of
the conditioner off of your hair leaving
it like really wavy and with lots of
volume so I'm still using that and I'm
still loving that and then in terms of
keeping my skin clear and washing like
makeup off and stuff I like to exfoliate
when I shower so I have these st. Ives
naturally clear apricot cleanser I
believe and it's blemish fighting which
has been crucial for me lately and then
four razors I actually use guys razors
which is might sound weird but I just
find it gives a better shave you know
and then this is the body wash I use
it's a new scent and it smells unreal
and then after my shower I edited a
video that's supposed to go live while
I'm away it was actually last weeks my
life Monday so I will leave a link to it
somewhere oh I just scratched my nose
I'll leave a link to it somewhere so you
guys can watch it I had some breakfast I
got ready and now here I am can't
believe that I leave in two days guys it
is crazy to me how quickly this trip
kind of climbed up on me I am so excited
but I still have so much to do so it's
now time to pack my suitcase for
California I'm going to vlog it with you
guys I have my packing checklists ready
and open if you guys have been watching
long enough to remember when I made
these then comment down below I really
want to know because that means you've
guys have been watching for a long time
what have been two years ago in a video
so that is the lists that I'm going to
be using to help me pack so let's do it
is yours trippin on skies sippin
waterfalls my youth my youth is yours
run
years by you
the truth
players by
okay so now that I am officially packed
while my clothes are packed anyway I'm
going to pack like my makeup and all the
stuff that I can't pack today tomorrow
so that'll be like my techy stuff and
basically what I'm going to bring on my
carry-on so now I'm going to go film the
rest of a video that's going up later
for this week while I'm away and then
get on the rest Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
