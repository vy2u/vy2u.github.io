hey everyone so today my tutorial is
super super easy it's basically just a
bunch of messy buns it took me a while
to kind of master the musty bun and
there's a couple different kinds of
messy buns that I do so I'm going to
show you guys on the three three
different messy buns that I do there's a
couple more that I do too but I figure
these are the three that I do the most
so I figure they would be the ones you
guys would probably want to see and
they're all super super easy they're
really good for like second day hair or
when your hair is really messy or if you
just kind of need to throw your hair up
and get it off your shoulders or off
your face or if you're wearing a shirt
that's really cute and it has like
detail or design that you want to be
seen you can just throw your hair up in
a messy bun and even though it's a messy
bun you still look really put together
and really cute um the only things
you're going to need are an elastic
either one the closest color to your
hair or if you wanted to a colored
elastic like one this would obviously
show up in my hair or like a bright
color to last that could match what
you're wearing you could always do that
too and also um eyebrow and other than
that I guess I'll just get straight to
the tutorial and I tend not to brush
through it before I do any of these
hairstyles maybe the last bun but um
with not brushing through it I find it
gives it more texture and more of like
the messy appearance but if you're
looking for something a little more
uniform you can go right ahead and brush
through your hair I just if you're going
kind of for what my bun ends up looking
like in the end I would leave your hair
kind of textured and whatnot and so for
the first bun I'm going to be leaving my
fringe out so I'm just going to kind of
pull forward what I don't want to be in
the bun but if I end it if any of the
hair that I do want to stay out ends up
in the bun we can just pull it out
afterwards so it's not a big deal so
just kind of bear with me it's going to
be kind of confusing at first so what
you're going to want to do is put your
hands in like claw formation and we're
going to start from like where your
jawline is kind of follow along it and
pull all the hair up to the top of your
head like that and it's okay if there's
hair that didn't get up you
kind of claw that up into it as well and
we're going to get this like messy kind
of thing going on and I just kind of
comb back um all the hair so that it's
not too messy or too many bumps but not
so that it's completely slick or
anything either so then kind of when I
have the the formation the way I want it
I'd take the ponytail put my hand back
into a claw and claw through all of the
hair with the hand that has the elastic
on it so my fingers are all clawed
through all this hair and then it just
kind of sits here then I grab the
elastic and wrap it around and then
quickly twist and wrap it around again
which kind of leaves you with this bun
right here and then I'm just going to
like pull on it and play with it until I
get it to its preferred messiness and
then any hair that did get pulled back
that we didn't want pulled back you just
kind of pull it back forward I just said
pull a lot in that sentence okay and for
this one too even though it's more
zoomed in so you guys can kind of see
what's going on I'm going to go a little
faster because I find the faster you do
this one the Messier it gets so I'm just
gonna kind of there we go I'm going to
plot all up where I want it my fingers
are already all through the hair and
just really quickly there we go so this
is the band that I ended up with when I
went a little faster as you can see it's
a lot messier than the first time I did
it and like if any hair is kind of
bothering you you can just kind of tug
at it and it'll easily kind of come out
of the bun and you can just fix up
whatever you want to up in this area and
then this is kind of like a back view of
the bun so from the side and then from
the back okay so for the second bun it's
going to be more of like a messy top not
been so if you don't know what a topknot
bun is it's usually when all your hair
is pulled up like like a ballerina and
like twist it around and just kind of
placed on top of your head so we're
going to do kind of the same thing but
it's going to be more of like a Messier
top knot bun I've combed all my hair
back into a ponytail including my fringe
you can leave your fringe out if you
want but I find this one looks better if
all your hair is combed back and
basically it's just combed back into a
ponytail wherever I want my bun to be
positioned which is usually in the back
the back top of my head so then what I'm
going to do is I'm quickly going to
start twisting this around itself and
then I'm going to use my hand right on
top of the bun and just secure it so at
first it's going to look like just a
normal top knot bun which you could just
leave it like this too because this hair
is still messy and pull down hair to
frame your face but I like to make the
bun a little Messier too so I just kind
of lightly tug on it to make sure that
it's not just going to fall out or
anything
and with tugging on it it's going to
loosen up the bun and let some hairs
kind of fall loose as well which is
going to make it a little Messier so
just lightly tugging on it and if it
seems to feel like it's starting to get
too loose kind of reach towards the
middle and pull tight which will tighten
the bun so as you can see we still kind
of like the top knot structure going on
but it's just a lot Messier and looser
and then I usually just pull down here
to frame my face because I look really
weird with all my hair fully pulled back
and then this is the bun we end up with
so it's still got like the donut thing
going on but it's just way less
structured more messy and you can play
around with this as long as you want if
hair does follow it like I like these
hairs that follow but if you don't just
you can bobby pin them and that's
basically what it looks like from the
back and from the sides and again you
can leave your fringe down for this bun
or you can put it up it's totally up to
you some people like to leave their
fringe down but I'm going to pull mine
up for this one so basically again I'm
just going to pull all my hair put comb
my fingers through my hair and pull it
up into where I would usually probably
put a ponytail and from there with the
hair in my hand I'm just going to take
my brush and quickly brush through any
knots I may have that's why I am rushed
the reason why I'm brushing it while
it's in the ponytail is to keep this
hair still messy
but keep this hair more put-together
so basically what I'm going to do is put
my hair like I'm going to do a ponytail
so I pulled it through once I look at
all that crazy hair brush that all out
too and then pull it through again but
I'm only going to pull it like halfway
through like that so I still have some
hair hanging down here and I've got this
little cute thing on my head and I mean
you can leave your hair like this if
that's what you're into but that's not
what I'm going to do so basically if you
see the holes on either sides you're
just going to pull put your thumbs
through those holes and pinch with your
hands and just pull on it and you're
just going to kind of continue to do
this until you get your preferred
messiness and if you want to cover like
the elastic down at the bottom or like
if there's any holes you just kind of
put your fingers as close to the elastic
as possible and pull and that's going to
bring your bun forward - and then I just
kind of play with the hair pulling it
down and pulling it out in places that
seem a little too tight and just kind of
play around with it let some of the
pieces fall it like this and it just
kind of gives it this overall messiness
and as you can see this is why I brush
my hair through because it gives the bun
a little bit more of like a fluffier
messy look versus um an audio message so
and if pieces like this do you fall down
and you don't want them you can just
pull it up with your hands and in the
back just kind of tuck it under the
elastic so then you got to get this like
fanned out bun across your head and you
can make these ones like as big or as
small as you want and then I pull down
some hair to frame my face and my hair
is crazy today and again you can pull
your bangs down if you want you can
really do whatever you'd like with your
hair once it's finished you could pull
it out make it more volume eyes and so
that is what the bun ends up looking
like and from the sides and then from
the back so I hope you guys enjoyed this
