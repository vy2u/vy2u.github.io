channel you'll have to excuse my voice a
little bit sick right now
welcome to day 11 I believe it's day 11
of u Tober I hope you guys have been
enjoying all the videos thus far this
video is a really exciting one as you
probably already know from the title
we're gonna be making some super yummy
recipes and we're gonna be baking and
it's gonna be so much fun
if you're new to my channel be sure to
subscribe and if you haven't already be
sure to follow my Instagram and my
Twitter which I'll put right here I'm
posting a bunch of fall photos right now
so definitely be sure to go check that
out and other than that if you guys want
to see is summer really I mean baking
recipes for the fall / Halloween time
then just keep watching
so the first recipe I have to show you
guys is for these super yummy pumpkin
muffins and then I ended up and making
it with a vegan coconut milk icing I
would sit here and riddle off the whole
recipe for you guys but I feel like that
would just be super repetitive and kind
of annoying so I put the whole recipe up
on the screen here the only part of the
recipe that I didn't put up is how to
make the coconut milk icing which is
super duper easy all you have to do once
you bake before you even bake sorry is
the night before take a can of full fat
coconut milk and make sure you pop it in
the fridge and yeah I'm getting way
ahead of myself telling you guys this
now but you'll see what I mean and then
I just whisked it up with a little bit
of icing sugar and then out of it on top
of these muffins but yeah just super
easy recipe and these are really really
good for breakfast in the fall time or
for packing up and bringing for your
lunch as well
and so at this point in the recipe you
could just add a full can of pumpkin
puree but just to get a little bit of
extra sweetness and cuz I figured why
not it couldn't be any worse tasting I
decided to add a can of pumpkin pie
filling instead and then of course just
added it to the little muffin cups and
popped it in the oven at 350 for about
20 to 25 minutes or whenever you can
stick a toothpick through and then as I
already explained to you guys before I
just went ahead and mashed up some of
the coconut milk that I put in the
fridge overnight just make sure you get
rid of the actual coconut water on the
bottom whisk this up with a little bit
of icing sugar and that's all you have
to do
as long
so the next recipe I have to show you
guys is for this really easy apple crisp
and all I'm gonna do is start by cutting
up at four
generally big apples you can use
whatever favorite apples you guys have
but I like these little like red and
green ones that you would get from like
I don't even know what I'm trying to say
right now so go ahead and put them in a
tray and then I sprinkled some cinnamon
on top as well as some brown sugar and
baked it for about 15 minutes at 350
degrees and then I went ahead and made
it the crisp part now if you want to use
granola instead of oats that's what I
usually do but I didn't have granola on
me this day I just find it makes the
apple crisp a little crunch here but if
you'd rather be rather it be a little
less crunchy then go ahead and use oats
instead of
and that's all there is to the super
yummy apple crisp and I highly recommend
it eating of this with some coconut ice
cream it is so flippin good and also
what is there not to love about mini
pumpkin pies guys this is like the lazy
girl hack this is gonna be the laziest
recipe so if you guys don't want to do
any of the other ones this one's super
easy so I found these ready crusts grams
from Loblaws it was like my local
superstore but I'm sure you guys can
find them and they're actually vegan but
if you want an actual vegan pie crust
recipe I'm gonna leave one down below
for you guys if you can't find these
little grande pies but they are vegan
and so is the pumpkin pie filling so
it's honestly the easiest thing that you
will ever see I just figured I'd put a
lazy girl recipe in here for those of
you guys that maybe don't really want to
bake that much and then I popped a bit
of that coconut cold coconut icing on
top as well
and last but not least are these super
yummy salted caramel fudge brownies so
again I'm going to leave the full recipe
right up on the screen for you guys
because I don't want to like list it off
and be repetitive but yes this recipe is
super super easy just make sure you make
a really big batch of the caramel sauce
which is what I'm making right now on
screen because once you make the caramel
sauce you have to add quite a bit of it
to the cocoa and the flour to get it to
be a bit more of like a fudgy texture so
I suggest at the very end I ended up
making up a little bit extra and then
drizzling it on top of the brownies but
that's totally up to you guys I just
figured it would be a nice little
reminder because I ended up using the
whole first batch of the salted caramel
and the like flour and the powder
and then a really good tip for these
brownies is to add a little bit of
almond milk until you get the
consistency of the batter that you want
it depends on how dense you want the
brownies to be then go ahead and put
them in a pan and just use a spoon to
kind of matte it Pat it down and then
pop it in the oven and that's all you
have to do and then I drizzled a little
bit of the extra salted caramel on top
and that was it
so those were all of the recipes that I
had to show you guys these brownies were
so friggin delicious they were super
sticky and fudgy and so good
so that was it for all of the recipes I
had to show you guys today sure to let
me know down below if you guys plan on
trying any of them out and other than
that I will see you guys all in
tomorrow's video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
