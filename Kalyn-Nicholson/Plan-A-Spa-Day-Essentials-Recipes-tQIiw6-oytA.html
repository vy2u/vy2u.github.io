something for Valentine's Day it's not
necessarily just for that day so if
you're watching this past it I mean
continue watching because you could
literally do this any day of the week
but for today's video I'm going to be
doing a like how to plan a pamper day
now you can do this with a friend you
could do this with a bunch of friends
you can do this with your mom you could
do it just by yourself
really it's totally up to you just
planning a pamper day for yourself to
give yourself a little bit of self-love
and other than that if you guys want to
plan your own at-home spa day with
recipes and tips and tricks and all of
that fun stuff then just keep watching
so if you don't have a hot date for
Valentine's Day this is all you're going
to need for a perfect pamper day it's
some slippers magazine some razors teeth
whitener coconut oil or any type of
moisturizers exfoliates face masks nail
polish and all of that fun stuff and so
I always start a pamper day by jumping
in the shower but if again if you're
doing this with friends or your mom or
whoever you guys could just make sure to
wet your hair and another thing I love
using is this little like waterproof
case so you can blare music while you're
in the shower you go and get away so if
you're looking to do a hair mask you
could just leave in your conditioner or
use coconut oil like I did I was
recommended this by a friend so I
decided to give it a go and I just
massage some of the coconut oil into my
fingers and then throughout my hair
making sure not to get too close to my
roots because I didn't want to make it
greasy but mostly just concentrating on
my ends and just kind of massaging it
through and putting it up in a bun and
then I'm just going to leave that in for
as long as possible so I am just leaving
that in my hair for the whole day and
then while I wait I'm going to start
with a pedicure so I actually got this
little like foot Soaker thing from
Walmart but you guys could just grab
like a big bowl and fill it with hot to
warm water and then just soak your feet
for a little bit and then the first
thing that I'm going to do after soaking
is just dampen them off just a tiny bit
and then start taking off the nail
polish that I had on before
so the next I'm just taking this
exfoliant that I got from the body shop
but you guys could just make your own or
whatever you have on hand and all I'm
doing is massaging this into my feet to
remove any dead skin or anything like
that and then again I'm just doing it to
the other foot free weight and then I'm
going back in again with one of these
like I don't even know what I would call
this but I'm just gonna go back in with
this and then really get in on like the
heels and around like the balls of your
feet and all of that stuff where it
tends to kind of get really thick and
like I don't even know this is just this
is not going over well but anyways after
that I'm going to paint my toes and I
just decided to go back with white again
and then all that's left to do is
moisturize so I'm just using this little
cream that I got from the body shop and
again this is good for like your nails
and for soaking into your skin but you
could use any type of moisturizer that
you might have and then of course you
could go ahead and give yourself a
manicure as well you can soak your
fingers file them and trim your nails
all that fun stuff take off your old
nail polish and then paint them again
and if you guys are wondering what nail
polish I'm using I believe it is blonde
or Blanc I don't know how to say it but
anyways it's just the white nail polish
by Essie
and what would a pamper day be without a
face mask now this is just a tea tree
face mask and it's probably been my
favorite for a few years now it just
gets really good at getting rid of
blemishes and all that but again any
face mask will do you can even make your
own or anything like that and then I'm
just leaving that on for a little bit
making myself a cup of tea before I hop
in the shower take all of that stuff off
and shave and then afterwards
every time you shave don't forget to put
on like a cream or this time I decided
to go with a body butter because it's a
bit thicker and I really wanted to
moisturize on my spa day and a spa day
is not a spa day without some good food
so some treats that I decided to make
the first one is a three layer dip so
I'm just using some salsa some hummus
and some guacamole along with some vegan
shredded cheese so I'm starting with the
guacamole on the bottom and just using a
spoon to kind of massage it into like a
nice layer on the bottom of the bowl
before I grab the hummus and then I'm
using hummus instead of most people I
believe use like cream cheese or sour
cream but I decided to go with hummus
because it's vegan and it's also just
healthier for you so then I'm just
putting a thicker layer of that in
between the guacamole and then topping
that off with salsa and this has been
like my favorite salsa I went with like
a medium I don't know what the brand is
but either or you can use any salsa and
then just pour that on top and then all
I'm doing is taking a bit of the day up
shredded cheddar cheese and it is a
vegan shredded cheese and you can find
this at most grocery stores I assume and
then just putting that on top and then
popping that in the oven to let the
cheese melt and then in the meantime I'm
just taking some whole wheat wraps and a
pizza cutter and I am just going to cut
these into little triangles now you guys
could just use like tortilla chips or
and crackers or anything like that but
if you wanted to make like a healthier
alternative all you have to do is cut up
some whole wheat wraps and then put some
a little bit of salt and pepper and then
broil them in the oven just make sure
you keep an eye on them because they do
burn really really quickly
so that was just my quick and easy three
layer vegan dip but it dip isn't so much
your thing you could also make a vegan
pizza especially if you're doing this
with a friend so I just got these little
like pizza crusts from the grocery store
and I'm just going to take the sauce and
put that on and again just kind of even
it all out with a spoon and then I'm
using the day of vegan shredded cheese
and we starting with cheddar and then
topping it off with mozzarella and then
I'm also using vegan pepperonis so
basically this is just like a vegan
pizza made from heaven and I'm just
popping that into the oven for about
10-15 minutes I'm not exactly sure how
long I put it in but either way this is
so easy to do and if you can find all
the ingredients and you miss pizza as a
vegan then you're gonna love this pizza
it's so good if you're looking for
something a little more sweet or your
having a lot of people over for your spa
day you can just make some popcorn so
I'm just putting some kernels into a
steamer but you could use a brown paper
bag and then putting a little bit of oil
as well as some vegan butter and some
salt and then after the popcorn is
popped while it's still hot to make sure
to put some M&amp;amp;M some dark chocolate
chips sorry I got this idea from
somebody that actually did it with M&amp;amp;Ms
but to make it vegan I use the dark
chocolate chips and then while the
popcorns hot you just kind of mix it
around and it gets in with like the
buttery and the salt so if you're
someone that likes like chocolate
covered pretzels or like the sweet and
salty taste then you'll definitely like
this popcorn and it's super easy to do
and perfect for a spa day with a bunch
of your friends so all you need is a
glass of wine or juice if you are under
the legal drinking age and other than
that that's all you have to do to make
all of these really yummy spa day treats
