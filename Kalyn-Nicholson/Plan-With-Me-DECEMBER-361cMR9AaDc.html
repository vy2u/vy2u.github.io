changed my cameras and the hall in love
with you take me out somewhere the
swirling under you need to believe in
yourselves like I'd hold on
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm going
to be doing another plan with me video
this is a video that I did in U Tober
and I've done a few in the past before
but I thought I'd be fun to start
breaking them down into more monthly
style videos if that makes sense so
instead of doing like a generic plan
with me where I just show you like the
tips and tricks and habits oh they use
I'm actually gonna go ahead and plan the
whole month of December on camera with
you guys so you guys can see everything
right down to like the nitty gritty
details hello I can hear your little
claws Bentley has no idea that in like
30 minutes we're going to the ve T if I
see the word out loud he'll know it
makes me so sad because he probably just
thinks we're gonna go for a little w eh
okay but let's just get right to it so
this month is going to be a bit of a
crazy month even just solely for the
fact that I'm doing the 12 days of camus
which means I'm going to need to get
about 12 videos pre-filmed done and
ready as well as the other videos that
will go up throughout the month before
and after the twelve days of camus not
to mention that it is the last month of
the year which that's sad if you guys
want to plan with me for 2018 or like
for January as well definitely thumbs up
or leave a comment down below because I
feel like January's will be very
interesting as well
backtracking getting ahead of myself
December is still going to be a hectic
month with all of the videos there's a
couple big projects that I'm working on
right now and even just Christmas
shopping and budgeting for that so we're
gonna go over all of that everything
from my lists to my monthly dry erase
board to my planner to my budget for the
month first up we're gonna start with my
new
so before I start planning any month I
like to make lists in my notebook to
make sure that I'm keeping on top of all
the things that I need to actually get
accomplished for the month so write down
all the things I need to remember
whether I'm doing like events or like 12
days of Christmas or little goals that I
have or to make like a monthly budget
how many times a week I want to work out
throughout the month if I want to try a
new restaurant if I want to try a new
recipe and then on the side of that I'll
write down any work-related things that
I really want to get done whether it be
videos or things for my blog things like
that then usually the next step that I
take when it comes to planning out my
month is I will pull out my dry erase
monthly calendar I love God bless this
thing honestly I don't know what it is
but being able to see your whole month
in one just condensed area it is such a
nerdy gratifying feeling which makes it
really easy to plan ahead like if you
know that there's something you want to
get done by the end of the month there's
little things that you could be doing in
the first few weeks that you might not
do if you don't plan your whole month in
advance if that makes sense
so giving yourself kind of the time to
go through I'm actually such a nerd as
all of these things are projecting out
of my mouth things seem so normal as I'm
doing them but now that I'm talking
about them on camera I'm realizing how
incredibly Monica Geller I am about life
okay
so I'm responsible I'm organized but hey
I can be a kook being able to look at
everything from a hole for the whole
buns and even like the weeks before and
after makes it so easy to just like plan
ahead and stay on top of everything
I also love writing olives like my
monthly goals on the side studio if it's
just like to read a book to run five
times a week whatever it is just on the
side because then if I complete that by
the end of the month it's just I got a
happy little bonus and normally when I
complete my goals on the side as well at
the end of the month I always give
myself like a little treat though
there's just like buying like a couple
things from you know my favorite
clothing store putting a little bit of
extra money into like the vacation jar
and things like that
the third step I take when it comes to
planning my month is I will then
transfer my to-do lists and all the
lists that I pretty much made in my
notebook and start seeing how they fit
into my planner I don't like to plan
more than a week in advance when it
comes to my planner for instance how I
already have the whole month scheduled
out the thing that I like about that
being on a dry race is that if things
end up having to shift or something pops
up I can easily erase it and rearrange
things once you tend something into a
planner it is so it just it's one of
those like little things you know like
some people it's the nail on chalkboards
other people it's like the sound of
babies crying for me it's it's
scratching something out of my planner I
hate it I will only plan my week that
week instead what I'll do though is on
the side of the month inside my day
planner I will write out my twos there
and for the week that I'm planning I'll
see how many of my monthly news I can
get done
realistically established
so I usually divide my agenda or my
planner into two parts the left side I
like to put all my two dues for the day
that are more life based like walking
Bentley working out and taking a shower
getting ready things like thatif I have
appointments and then on the right side
I will put all my work-related things so
whether it's Eiko's day whether it's a
filming our editing day for the week I
was actually planning I was going away
on a trip but still I did the same thing
with just putting work and lifestyle
things like things I might do on the
trip and then I also put in all the
workouts I wanted to do since working up
five times a week is a goal of mine for
December and then off to the side in the
bottom I just put my two dues for the
week and my devise and then last but not
least when it comes to planning out the
month in advance I mean you can flip
them back and forth between three and
four but it is creating my monthly
budget so lately I have been making such
a big deal over sticking to a budget
saving my money and just like really
kind of planning for the future because
we're just like one of my biggest goals
right now that I want to buy a really
dope condo in Toronto that's my biggest
kind of target right now that I've been
focusing on so I've been super stingy
with my money which has been a new
feeling for me because normally I'm very
flowy carefree I'm like goodness twenty
bucks here thirty dollars thirty nine
forty dollars for groceries so the
process of which I've been using to make
a monthly budget is I'll usually start
out by putting in how much money that is
coming in for the entire month so how
much money you make as a whole for your
whole month you can also do this by
weekly but I find it easier to do for
the month as a whole then I put in all
of the things that I have to pay for
like bills rent cellphone like my yoga
membership things like that and then see
what's left over after you've paid all
your bills from what's left over I
usually put a chunk of that into savings
and then a chunk of that into work
expenses so usually I have to buy things
to do work or buy things for COEs so
I'll kind of do things that way and then
whatever's left over is what I have a
spending money for the rest of the month
I try and make this as little as
possible and put more things into
savings if I can and then whatever I do
have been spending money I actually
taken it with cash that way I know I'm
not overspending for my budget now this
month I also had to take into account
that it was Christmas so I'm
what I was going to use for my Christmas
Christmas gifts budget and then whatever
was left over is for groceries shopping
meals and yeah things like that so this
concludes me planning for the month of
December and like the four steps that I
generally take when planning out a month
in advance thumbs up if you guys enjoyed
this video because I'm definitely happy
to keep this in like a little series we
can do January which I feel it would be
really cool and include the whole year
for 2018 and that because I am more than
