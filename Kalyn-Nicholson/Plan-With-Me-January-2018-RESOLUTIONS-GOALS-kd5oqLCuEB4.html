about this time it's so January it hurts
my friend to set it down there on the
kids but hey guys oh what's up and
there's a hair in my lipstick hey guys
what's up and welcome back to my channel
for today's video well we move back up
happy
it is officially at the first day of
2018 which is actually epic in so many
in so many different forms and levels
you guys want to know how I entered the
new year yes that would be Greg and I
kissing Bentley no better way to enter
the year right for today's video I'm
going to be doing a plan with me video
for January / 2018 as promised I did one
in December and asked you guys if you
wanted to see one kind of like an
overall for 2018 as well as planning the
month of January and you guys answered
back with a heck yes so here we are
really difficult I'm following you
already be sure to follow my Twitter and
my Instagram I will leave the links
right here I've also been posting a lot
to my blog and yeah aside from that
there's gonna be some epic some epicness
in today's video so I feel like we
should just roll reading on into it so
being that it is not only a new year but
also a new month I definitely needed to
get ahead of my schedule in terms of
planning and it's a new year so I had to
make a new journal not to start out with
some new planters it's it's Cod guys I'm
not kidding you my my soul is very much
on a high right now from all of the the
new prepping and planning and even
better that I got to do it on camera
with you guys because I don't know why
these plan with me videos are not
something I ever did in the past but it
doesn't matter I will just start doing
them if you guys want we can do them
every month this year so wicked being
2018 I decided to make a new journal for
this year I did a little DIY I picked up
the actual journal itself from chapter /
indigo I picked it up in my last video
if you guys haven't seen it I'll pop it
up on the screen or leave a link to it
down below but I just picked up one of
these like mo journals just like a
smaller one the one thing that I knew
from my last journal is that I wanted
something a bit more compact that it's
easier to travel with and then I went
ahead and did eyes DIY for this so all I
did for the DIY was print off a pic
of the celestial like moon all the
phases of the Moon but I printed off an
Oreo version of it literally found the
photo on we heart it printed it off on
to sticker paper which is basically like
label paper so I printed it off onto
label you can peel and stick them on
things and then I just cut out each of
the Oreos put them into the phases of
the Moon and then used one of these
fabric markers too right on top of it
2018 and then I wrote magic because like
I said magic is my motto for this year
and another idea if you don't want to do
like the Oreo moons or whatever another
thing that I printed off to was this
piece of artwork right here and again I
just printed it onto the label paper and
then stuck it on the very front page
just that a little title photo that says
2018 journal and I put one of the Oreos
except I kind of made it look like a yin
and yang symbol the second page I just
wrote January to start off the whole
month of journaling so I think I want to
do this for every single month just to
keep track and then just to start off my
journal to give you guys a quick look of
some of the things that I like to write
in my journal the very first page of
course being that it is 2018 I decided
to write out my goals my resolutions and
my priorities I don't just believe in
making New Year's resolutions I think
you should make resolutions goals and
priorities kind of like you know you
need all three of that structure to keep
yourself in balance a difference for me
between resolutions and goals or goals
are like a 1 complete finished dumb
thing whereas I feel like resolutions
are something that you're always
constantly working on there's never any
end point to it if that makes sense you
guys aren't curious my resolutions for
2018 are one to be less stressed and to
do that I plan on doing meditation and
yoga get really good at cooking again
making cool vegan meals at home so that
I'm not constantly spending money on
burritos or you know like Thai food like
why not make burritos and Thai food at
home but find a really quick or a
healthier a cheaper version to make at
home and just enjoy the actual process
of cooking my food my next dress
illusion is to spend more time with
family and friends is something that I
don't think you can ever do too much so
I wrote that down as resolution I want
to travel any opportunity that it
presents itself and I want to become
more of an optimist I don't think I was
a pessimist in 2017 but I think I owe
you in and out of being an optimist and
a pessimist
so I want to focus on being more
optimistic in 2018 in terms of goals the
actual structured goals that I have
planned number one is to buy a
in Toronto on the second biggest goal I
have for this year is releasing
dreamcatcher book that I've been working
on for like three years now and I'm just
like I'm ready to let it present itself
to the world move on from it on to the
second book and dream catchers so that
is something that I'm really really
gonna be working on in the next two
months the next Allegro is to become a
yogi and if you're curious what I mean
by that I used to be super into yoga and
I got super into it I was practicing it
a lot at home it's getting into like the
arm stands and the head stands and I was
getting good at it and then I just fell
off and lately I've been really drawn to
yoga I've been doing it on my own and
going back to my hot yoga classes
I just want to practice yoga more
basically is what I'm getting on by
forth goals that I want to write
something every single day whether it's
a journal post whether it's a blog post
in terms of priorities I was writing
this on a whim so I'm probably gonna
have to add to this list as the year
goes on but for now my priorities are my
health be it physical and mental I think
that you can't give yourself if you're
not at your most like healthy state
whether it be mentally or physically I
think that it's not selfish to put that
first on your priority list I think that
that is important to put that first on
your priority list because when you're
at your best and you feel that your best
you're able to give your better self to
other people then second I wrote friends
and family of course including Bentley
third is my faith in my perspective who
I am at my core my connection with what
I believe it fourth is creating then
just as the list goes on it's
challenging myself traveling getting
enough sleep because that is freaking
important going outside of my comfort
zone more in 2018 music and reading time
management and then in brackets I wrote
lol because I'm actually really bad at
time management I am late to everything
and of course some other things that you
can write on there because once you have
all the important things at the top of
the list you can write whatever the heck
you want in your priority list I wrote
that I want to have killer style in 2018
it's okay to want those things next I
wrote some 2018 habits that I'm gonna
have to make to align with my goals and
my resolutions again this list is very
incomplete but I'm gonna add to it as
the year goes on I have working out five
times a week Tuesdays are my writing
days for writing any sort of book
there's a second book I already have the
premise written note for for the second
book of dreamcatcher and there's also
three other non-fiction books that I
already have the ideas written out for
so there's a lot of writing to do this
next I have that I want to start bullet
journaling once a week and then next I
am going to bed at 11 p.m. and waking up
at 7 a.m. because like I said getting
enough sleep is a priority of mine this
year because it actually makes for me at
least I find it makes a huge difference
so that's basically a rundown of the new
journal that I'm gonna have for 2018 and
the DIY portion of it and also when I
put inside of it
moving on of course we have to do the
dry erase the monthly dry erase this
thing saves my life time and time again
this is something I just keep above my
desk and because it is dry erase things
can get moved around without being too
like structured have my month work out
tally up at the top every time I work
out I'm giving myself a five dollar
tally so this will be my tally for the
end of the month to see how much I
actually ended up working out and how
much money I have to spend on myself so
nothing much changed from last month's
to this month's with my dry race I just
like to fill out what trips I'm going on
what videos I have to film what days I'm
filming them what days they go live what
days they're gonna get edited Thursday's
are structured out to solely work on
codes because there's a whole whack of
there's a whole other page that I didn't
even put in this video
that's just planning all the stuff
that's going on with codes this year
because I feel like it hasn't been at my
full potential and because I've been
trying to do too many things at once
said I've just structured out one day a
week where everything I do that day is
solely related to codes and that's all
it that's it that's all that's all the
work that gets done that day I guess
that's all that's really important in
terms of my diary's calendar of course I
needed to fill out my notebook this year
so this notebook is just like a complete
random miscellaneous notebook that I can
plan or write down anything in planning
out to do's planning out bucket lists
planning out my work schedule I planned
out my workout plan in here from my last
video and so I started off my 2018
bucket list in this notebook and it
started with the books that I want to
read and the travel that I want to do in
2018 again this list is unfinished
because it's only January and things
changed all the time and then next I
wrote down some 2018 video ideas so like
I said this book is just like planning
and listing all the Book of Lists let's
be real and then because it is a new
year the other thing I decided to write
out in this notebook is my 2018
I wrote that wrong I wrote 2000
2018 big goal breakdown so the bigger
goals that I have for 2018 I needed to
break down into smaller goals so that
it's easier to disperse them throughout
the year so for instance with releasing
dreamcatcher January the biggest thing I
need to do in January is completely
finished editing it have it ready to go
in February I can get the prototype done
I can get the front cover done and once
that's all done I could potentially
really releasing it in February or March
if all goes according to plan well
that's like breaking down the big goal
into smaller goals my coffee talk
podcasts that I want to start in 2018 I
need to obviously do some more research
on podcasts practice the first podcast
write out the script for it record it
edit it see what kind of problems I run
into what kind of things that I need to
fix so that I can get ready to actually
schedule out my first ever like podcast
schedule I guess you could say things
you can do after that is right down
beside each smaller goal which month you
should be doing it or week or day
breaking it down into smaller goals so
that you can plan it out into your day
planner or your big monthly gyrase and
last but not least I did an overall
monthly to do which is just like again
very generic but just things that I do
need to get done this month I really
want to scrub the crap out of my bathtub
because I really want to take bubble
baths like I don't know this is condo
someone's lived in this condo before me
I don't know who they were and just go
to town and clean out that bathtub and
start taking bubble baths again as
simple as that is but that's a monthly
to do for me going on my Hawaii trip
making a new channel banner for my
YouTube things like that just overall to
do that I want to get done before
February so that concludes my book of
lists and planning out all the lists
type items that I need to do and then of
course last but not least we have the
planners because it is 2018 we got to
open up some new fresh planners one of
the questions I've been getting so much
from you guys is what happened to the
coast planner made up a template then I
paid somebody to basically mimic and
recreate that template for every single
week in every single month of the year
the website that we had it built on
completely crashed and wouldn't let me
export it they just basically said that
there was nothing that could really do
to help it's just a fact that it's too
big of a file every time I tried it just
it would crash it just wouldn't work
after that happened you Tober started on
all these things started happening and
it
again it got pushed off to the side I
was trying to do way too many things at
once so I am going to still try and get
a planner done but for now I'm just
using the Karma paper Co this is the
planner that I also had last year I got
the floral design and it's silver and
says Caleb Nicholson and says 2018
planner and then basically all I did was
I looked at my book of lists and filled
out basically this week what I'm gonna
need to do in terms of work the left
side is always lifestyle things the
right side is always work-related things
so I also planned out like my gist for
this Sunday and how I'm going to scrub
the living crap out of my bathtub so I
can start taking bubble baths see full
circle everything is like fitting into
the year already so nicely and then last
but not least in the little box at the
bottom I just keep all of my weekly to
do is so that is the planner that I'm
going to be using for 2018 I'm really
excited I love like there's nothing
better than just a fresh new planner you
know it just looks so beautiful and
untouched and just ready to be planned
in and then if you guys watched my what
I got for Christmas I picked this up
from Urban Outfitters if it's a heavy
day or if I'm filming that day that is
exactly what this planner is gonna be
for I'm not going to necessarily use it
every day this is just gonna be for
heavy work days the thing I like about
this one is that at the top it gives you
a place to put the date then it says
like your objective for the day which I
feel like is really good on busy and
hectic days because it's like no matter
what this is the objective this is a
number one thing that I really need to
get done there's a notes section so you
can like kind of brainstorm
there are HD lists pretty much is
transfer what's in this one to this one
and then on the other side it says next
so there I just write what I also need
to do tomorrow just to have an idea of
what's going to be following up the
things that I need to do that day bottom
there's objectives and projects so this
could be overall projects you're working
on for the whole week this could just be
like for instance I put work out it
might not be my full objective for the
day but it's still an objective that I
have and it's something that I have as a
New Year's resolution and the other
thing I really like about it too is it
does the timetable on the side so you
can still kind of map out your day if
you want to use the timetable so this is
gonna be really really good to use on
super busy days combination of these two
are basically going to be my bread and
butter for 2018 so that concludes of my
January slash 2018 a planner
me video I hope you guys enjoyed if you
guys want to see these for every single
month if you want me to make this a
series for 2018 just thumbs up or leave
a comment down below and if there's any
other requests or you know like things
you guys want to see specifically in
these plan with me videos if you want me
to get more in-depth on my workouts for
that week more in-depth on my meal plan
my budgets tell me and I can totally
make like February's a little bit more
focused on that so it's not the same
thing every single month I hope you guys
are excited for 2080 or as excited as
I'm feeling I hope you guys are enjoying
the new backdrop all the stuff I got in
yesterday's video and I hope that this
put you guys in a Monica Geller mode so
that you guys can go off and I'll play
