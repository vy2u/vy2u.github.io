a beautiful world it's a Friday it is
gorgeous out we have zero complaints
don't we thank you for that very rich
commentary totally forgot to put
lipstick on but hey that's cool
you just have you live in life yeah hey
guys what's up and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm sure many
of you guys are gonna be very happy to
know that I'm doing a plan with me for
June I didn't do one for May and I was
not expecting it so much heartbreak like
yeah I got so many comments of people
being like where's the Mae plan with me
and I was like I was traveling for like
all of April so I didn't really plan May
and honestly May was one of those months
where it just it got away from me you
know I was a little preoccupied you feel
also this is decaf please be proud of me
I'm trying to limit my caffeine intake I
feel good eight like I don't have that
like icky jittery nauseous whatever I'm
pretty sure was this time last year
actually that I did like a month or two
off of coffee completely do you guys
remember that what a time also I need to
show you this because like what Bentley
just did hey you cozy cozy your Friday
vibe in itself but we getting so used to
daily vlogging now that like pulling my
camera and just showing you guys what's
actually the haps rather than making it
so cookie cutter professional has been
nice anyways I'm gonna stop rambling for
today's video we are doing a plan with
me for June I am NOT going to be using a
my planner and I'm not gonna be using my
dry erase this is gonna be very
different we're going back to the good
old bullet journal my agenda started to
feel a little bit like a prison like a
trap was something that was giving me
more anxiety in the last like few weeks
then it was helping me I guess because
if my date ended to go a different way
or a task that was on there ended up
taking more time than I thought and I
couldn't get to the other tasks I
wouldn't have time to get those done
before waking up to the following day
and needing to get those ones
and so it's just starting to make me
feel like you know just overwhelmed and
feeling like I was constantly behind
when in all reality like you should be
able to just like maneuver and move
things around and not be so structured
and let kind of like the universe guide
you to and so for that reason I decided
to go back over to my bullet journal and
just change up the way that I kind of
light out my planning schedules or the
things that I'm trying to kind of create
or complete in my life so we're gonna do
monthly goals we're gonna do summer
bucket lists we're gonna do a dream
board for June like to manifest some
things for the summer slash this month
really quick before we start I thought
it would be fun since you guys have been
seeming to enjoy it and yesterday I went
and got a tarot reading done at the rock
store so I'm just feeling super inspired
by Tarot right now I thought it would be
kind of fun to ask the tarot cards how
June is gonna be so let's start with
that what do we got coming in we have
been nine cups the knight of cups
meaning bliss and harmony at last the
card of wishes comes true when the
knight of cup of peers worries and fears
will be cast away a new phase of peace
and harmony awaits the world seems to be
granting your every wish good health
happiness and even material gains are
headed your way and beside that we
pulled the ace of cups which is new
beginnings so maybe it's the new
beginning of an era of bliss and harmony
also I don't know why but these like
both these cards just like breathe June
like even the colours of them are like
very June so this is the Ace of Cups and
it means ace marks the beginning of
exciting new phases
since the suit of cups deals
specifically with love and emotion
you're in for a real treat
expect either a blissful blissful time
of Health which is weird cuz this means
bliss joy and friendship a new love
could be on the horizon you may feel
that you're making a whole new start
just go with it and allow the feeling to
revitalize your spirits next we have the
daughter of swords honest and insightful
the daughter of swords is a young woman
whose honesty and insights take her far
in life people truly value her Frank
it almost seems like she's never stops
watching sometimes this can become a
burden for her as she can't help but
noticing the small detail that could
have been better so maybe that's like a
warning to just like stay honest and
stay observant but don't don't like
harness that don't get too focused and
then last but not least we have the son
of ones the son of one's means charming
and adventurous the son of Wands is a
true charmer he is handsome and
adventurous and seems to say all the
right things but at some point you may
find that he becomes hard to know trust
your instincts with this one perfection
is an illusion okay we're gonna leave
this out and now we're gonna move on to
the planning
so seeing as it is June I figured we
would start things off you know with a
nice little front cover I saw something
like this like similar to it on tumblr
and was like mm-hmm
so you created it plus like I wanted the
overall theme of June to just be like
plants actually the overall theme of my
life has been plants so she wanted to
continue to like bring that forward you
know so the next I flipped the page and
did a brainstorm page so this is
something that I'm gonna leave kind of
open because anytime I have any ideas or
anything that pops up or pops through I
want to put it here I've been like
obsessed with brain storms and brain
nuts lately meaning like you put the
topic or whatever is like the main focus
in the middle of the page and then you
just like branch off from there and
create these like brain storms of ideas
or projects or anything that pops up
into your brain and so this one's gonna
be for like the whole month of June I
have video ideas blog ideas I'm going
here as oh no this month with Bentley so
if there's anything I think of in terms
of that trip I can pop it down there
playlist ideas since if you guys didn't
know this if you like most of you guys
do but I'm like obsessed with making
playlists I upload music playlists like
at least every week if not two weeks my
apartment like I'm gonna go apartment
hunting this month so what I'm kind of
trying to look for in an apartment
coming up with a monthly budget just
anything I want to do any sort of idea
or anything June related that I don't
necessarily have like the fundamental
whatever to plan it yet but I want to
pop it in the brainstorm because it's
like it's an idea
I feel like brain storms are super
important then they're actually so
helpful with like pulling ideas from the
universe and like bringing them into the
earthly realm and it doesn't even need
to be for like a month you could do
brain storms for videos you could do
brain storms for goals for bucket lists
for anything
really let's my brainstorms page and
then when you flip the next page i
decided to create a monthly layout so I
could look at my month as a whole so
what I like to do is once I have the
whole month mapped out and I filled in
what days are which and for me for some
reason I always consider the beginning
of the week should be Monday even though
that's like the most like least popular
way to fill out a calendar but for my
upload schedule it just works better in
dark green I outlined all my upload
dates so they're easy to spot and then I
use pencil to pencil things in that way
when things change it makes such a
substantial difference like that is one
of the main things that I've kind of
changed when it comes to planning things
lately is using a pencil instead of a
pen because then I don't get so like
when things change or like things don't
go according to plan you can easily
erase it and change things up for over
light some of these are gonna be like
five six weeks from now so I don't know
what I'm gonna want to film at that
point sometimes we just come up with
ideas as time progresses and that's kind
of finding that balance you know between
planning and also kind of letting the
universe guide us and I also mapped out
mayor's own a trip my blog posts and
again I used pencil to fill those things
in and then the coffee talk episodes and
I just put an episode seven eight nine
ten eleven because again the topics of
those could change so there you have it
and then I am just like a little section
on the side and I put a key because at
the end of each week what I want to do
is just write down like a keynote or
like a key item or something that I kind
of learned that unlocked something for
me or like especially when it comes to
meditation or when it comes to if I had
any like problems challenges or whatever
I put the little key because it's like
how did you unlock that problem what was
the solution rather than what was the
problem kind of thing in order to
remember it for later on but also bring
it into the next week that is my month
of a glance and then the next page I
decided to do a bit of like a summer
slash monthly mood board and dream board
I printed off some photos that really
got me feeling very June and summer
inspired and pose
to them on year I didn't even get to use
all of them I have so many left over so
I think I'm gonna do some sort of DIY
with these and one of the coffee
chronicles I just posted like some of my
main manifestations things that I want
to really bring forward this summer
things like you know moving to my
apartment I put two little like
apartment kind of vibes that I'm kind of
hoping to bring forward reading at the
beach and also the book says find things
to be happy about and there's this new
book I got you guys will see it in my
summer haul video that's coming books
that I got a home decor that I got and
clothing that I got for the summer and
one of the books that's in there it's a
hundred a hundred days to happy or a
hundred ways to be happy or to even just
the first few pages of it really
resonated with me so that kind of
reminded me of that book so I printed
that out just like coffee and she's like
I don't know just journaling and stuff
and I've been really digging hitting up
cafes lately it's been like this thing
I've been doing girl just living her
best life traveling Cheers in a glass
blind to the air which could be me
choosing you guys could you meet your
who knows we got some yoga of course how
could we forget a bunch of wine glasses
because friends bike and then this says
love and read books so these are just
some images that just really make me
feel like inspired and fun and motivated
for the summer time so I feel like
following up like the month with a
little bit of like a visualization it's
going to you know just just get that
good energy going so the next page I
decided to do my summer bucket list and
I wrote out the ones that are mandatory
for my summer bucket list some of the
things I put on here we're going go to
Canada's Wonderland my Chicago roadtrip
which would be end of June early July BC
which would also be in July so I guess I
can't get all of these done in June
afternoon brunch pants with big giant
sunglasses and go patio hopping like yes
go to this many concerts as humanly
possible go skydiving indoor and outdoor
because there's indoor skydiving here
come here buddy can I get gonna get come
yet check out the farmers market and
cook fresh dinners
sounds magical have a bonfire at the
beach a lot all of that fun stuff
basically just to inspire me to fulfill
my bucket list or summer of my dreams I
guess you know I'm just like I'm so
happy that it's summer this is more like
a plan with me for summer and then on
the other side this is something new
that I've decided to do because like I
said I don't want to be too day-by-day
I'm trying to live my life a little bit
more go with the flow and so instead
what I've been trying to do is set
intentions and set like focus points and
stuff and just kind of let those things
infuse themselves into my life and of
course you still have to have that to-do
list which we will get to but instead of
mapping out every single day like do
these eight single things and if you
don't do those eight things and the next
you know we've talked about this instead
I'm trying to do something a little bit
more like this where it's like at the
very top I decided to put the things I'm
trying to manifest and focus on again I
haven't fully filled this out because I
didn't want to just fill it fill it out
for the sake of the video I really
wanted to like sit down and think these
through so I popped a few that I did
know off the top of my head like of
course my main focus is always Bentley
and the health and fitness and wellness
and my friendships and family and then
some things I'm trying to manifest or
like some good summer memories and my
new dream apartment things like that
which see what I did there I mean I have
goals and habits I haven't filled this
out yet but for instance what I put is
like the six main goals or habits that
I'm gonna try and work on so it doesn't
have to be necessarily like wake up at 6
a.m. every day which you could put and
then how it would be like I'm gonna do
this or planning out exactly how you're
gonna fulfill that goal you could even
just add like a little tracker at the
bottom if it was more of like a habit
that you were filling out or you could
make it a goal like I want to learn how
to do this by the end of June or I want
to read four books by the end of June
and then then the how you could write
what books you're gonna read and again
you could make one of these little bars
like a little progress tracker which if
you're curious how to do that
underneath that I did my budget because
another big thing that I really want to
get
- and I have before as you get older the
earlier you learn it the better you get
at it the better you set yourself up for
the future so I want to stop aimless
spending and just like out of sight out
of mind and I really want to start
budgeting this month I'm in a very limbo
state of my life where I was debating
moving out west for a little bit I was
debating moving overseas at one point
and then I realized there's just
something about urano that I'm not ready
to let go of yet I want to rent another
year just to try out a different area of
Toronto and if I still feel that like
you know that like feeling that I want
to go live somewhere else I'm not tied
down to anything or about the end of my
next apartment I feel like I'm still
just wanting to route myself in Toronto
then I'll buy so my 2018 resolution of
buying my dream condo will be postponed
to 2019 but I'm okay with that because I
like this idea better it just feels more
right it's sitting where right in my
core I want to get exactly what I want
kind of thing so I want to say for that
but I also really want to say for travel
like traveling it's been something that
has been so it's just I'm like calling
me this year adventurous outside my
comfort zone things just something I
never thought I would be able to do on
my own but it's something that I've
really fallen in love with so with
budgeting like even just something as
simple as getting better at budgeting my
groceries could save me hundreds of
dollars for money towards food on trips
when my income comes through for the
month of June I'm gonna write it at the
top then I'm gonna subtract everything I
pay for my bills and then whatever
expenses I have for work because I work
technically for myself I do have to
expend some money then whatever is left
over I'm gonna decide how much I want to
try and spend on groceries for the whole
month how much I have for activities
because I mean summer buckle is and then
last but not least how much I want to
try and put away into savings and then I
can fill this bar up like a progress
tracker as those things kind of get
spent or save so that's this little
spread in my bullet journal and then
when you flip to the next page
this is what I'm really excited about
this is something that I think is huge
when it comes to just enjoying life I
decided to make this little June
memories because one thing that I'm
really trying to work on within myself
and just you know within my mind and
with meditation and mindfulness is not
just looking forward and driving forward
but also appreciating the now every day
in June at the end of the day I just
want to write down one memory I have
from that day it doesn't need to be huge
it could just literally be like Bentley
and I went for a cool walk or you know I
got a new plant or who knows what it
would be but every single day I just
want to write down one really good
memory I have of that day and then
decide that I have my to-mah-toes for
the month of June one of them is choose
your happy choosing to focus on the
things that make you happy rather than
focus on the things that don't make you
happy or outside of your control so
that's my main focus for the month of
June and then the other one is
unapologetic when we were going out the
other night Larissa was like I'm
apologetic that's like that's the theme
of the summer and I was like yes like
even when it comes to vlogging out in
public I'm just gonna be so unapologetic
I shot I did photos with my friend and
he just sent me the proofs and literally
even last night in my head whenever I
saw someone looking at us as we were
getting photos my head was just like
unapologetic don't apologize for being
who you are don't apologize for standing
out and living your best life or
speaking out as long as your intentions
are pure unapologetic that's the way I
see it and then last but not least next
up now this is something that I've
already been doing with my bullet
journal ever since I ditched my day
planner when it started to give me a bit
of anxiety and I'm sure I'll go back to
my day planner I think we all like you
know what I mean I feel like it's an ebb
and flow type of thing and
this thing called next step where I just
create a border and a bunch of squares
and then whenever I have a to-do list or
something that needs to be done in the
next whatever day - three days
I put it up here and then once it's done
I fill in the square and cross it off
I'll show you guys an example it's like
for instance this is my next step for
right now this week and I just at a time
I'm working on something I put a half
square I fill it in halfway but it just
makes it so much easier to like keep
track of the things that I need to be
doing without needing to like pin them
to a certain day and when I wake up I'm
like what can I get done - right now
like what can I do in this moment what
can I do in the now and I focus on that
one task and when it's done I cross it
off and then I'm like okay what could I
do next so you have a shift you can't
just be like I'm not inspired to go to
work today like you have to go to work
obviously but this would be good for
like things you have to do at home
things that you might be trying to
accomplish in your personal life and
then maybe create a second system or in
your monthly spread kind of put in like
your shifts or what days you have to
work there there you have it I hope you
guys enjoyed today's plan with me for
June again I wanted to switch it up a
little bit by including my summer bucket
list including a little bit of like a
monthly dream board and also like I said
last month I didn't do a plan with me
because I wasn't planning anything I was
so uninspired by it and now that I'm
slowly breaking that mold again and
trying to find the balance with
incorporating planning but also
incorporating living in the moment I
felt like this was the best way for me
to do June and I feel really happy about
it I feel inspired by this I put a
little tab so it's easy to find but I
can also shut this book and put it away
and I don't need to fill it out every
day I don't need to look at it every day
I can just see what I got to do put it
away and then there's no day-to-day
planner that's like kind of holding me
captive especially for the summer months
aside from that you guys decide to
recreate any of the bullet journal
inserts or just if you're inspired by it
and do your own thing with it definitely
let me know
or if you're just planning out June your
own special way I'd love to see pictures
I've been posting mine today too in step
told you guys I was all recording a plan
with me and aside from that I love you
guys to the minute back come here say
bye I love you
so unfamous zero zero cares given right
now by Bentley he is chewy the epitome
of Zen well are you so cute we're gonna
put Bentley's paw over the camera you
ready and here we go papa
nice try buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
