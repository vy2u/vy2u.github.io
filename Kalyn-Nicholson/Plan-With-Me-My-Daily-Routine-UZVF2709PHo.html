Tober for today's video I'm doing a plan
with doing video I'm going to show with
you guys exactly how I plan like my
video schedule as well as how I use my
daily planner which I actually have
right here on me so I'm just going to go
through the way I do it just basically
some tips and tricks that I use for
planning and using my day planner and
all of that fun stuff and little ways
that you guys could maybe like tweak and
change things to fit your lifestyle
better if you guys haven't seen it
yesterday's youtuber video I did a
Starbucks challenge I will leave
something up on the screen here so you
guys can click back and also if you guys
aren't following me already I'm going to
leave my Instagram and my Twitter right
here so you guys can click away I'm
actually doing tweets over on my Twitter
and I'm also posting a bunch of really
fun fall photos to my Instagram so if
you guys want to stay in this fall you
tober October world then it definitely
come follow me and check that it and
aside from that let's jump in so I'm not
going to show you guys absolutely every
single notebook that I use because I do
have a book that's just for like writing
down reminders for the day that popped
into my head and then I also have a
separate marbled notebook that's just
for planning um like full diagnostics of
videos like so when I go to plan out a
video I write all of the details that
are going to go into that video down but
I'm basically going to go into how I use
my day planner and how I plan my life on
this thing as well as on my dry erase
board so in terms of like my work
schedule and life in general I always
start by planning my whole month in
advance and I like to do that by using
my dry erase board so I actually picked
this up from Walmart but you can pretty
much find these like anywhere so
obviously I start out by putting the
numbers on the top of every single
square for the entire month that I'm
planning out in advance for this month I
was planning out September and then I go
ahead and fill in my upload days so
that's always when I start with the very
first week I upload every Monday and
every Wednesday so I'll write down which
videos going live on Monday which
you always going live on Wednesday and
so on and so forth and I'll do that for
every single week that is on the dry
race and that is my starting point and
obviously to adopt this for you guys
that could be if you do YouTube you
could do the same thing or you could put
in like your work schedule what hours
you know you're scheduled for if you
work at nine five or anything like that
you can write down all of your work
hours and then from there I will plan
out what days I'm going to film those
videos and what days I'm going to upload
those videos so I'm usually about a week
to two weeks ahead of time when it comes
to videos especially ever since I've
been filming you Tober what you guys
don't know is I'm actually filming this
at the end of August over is like a
special occasion where I have to be
incredibly ahead of schedule I like to
say about a week to two weeks ahead of
time in terms of my filming schedule and
honestly guys I was never always like
this this has only been in the last two
to three months I was always somebody
that was like rushing to get a video
edited before 5:00 p.m. so I could
upload it that day and filming it that
day or anything like that it just it
became so stressful for me that doing
this like this whole plan with me video
is exactly how I keep my life
so like scheduled and organized and
honestly it is such a satisfying feeling
but always film videos usually two weeks
in advance
I'll pick whatever day I'm going to film
that video and then I'll usually edit
that same video the next day I like to
keep that momentum and I also am
somebody that struggles with trying to
balance too many things at once so if I
know I'm focusing in on one video I will
always edit that video usually the day
after I film it to just get it done out
of the way and then on to the next one
and then of course I will always block
out any days that I'm going to be
traveling or any days that I have like
something special going on that day or
days off but technically I just consider
Sundays to be my days off when I say day
off the guys I absolutely love doing
YouTube so like I never actually take a
day off
so usually Sunday's are for writing
dream catcher or editing videos but it's
just kind of like that if I feel like it
and then along the side of my gyrase
calendar that is where I like to keep
kind of like reminders or things that
are going to be coming up in the
following months I dove my dry erase
board I wrote down every single you
Tober video that's going to be going
live I'm not going to show them all to
you guys because I like to keep the
surprise as well as just little things
that I want to try and get into that
month for this month for example I
really wanted to
read three books and start off my hot
yoga class it's that it's pretty much
the gist of using my dry race calendar
next we will move into using my day
planner I currently have the Erin
Condren planner and I picked this up
actually super recently after I found
out that she had done like a monochrome
inside where all the tabs and everything
are black but first thing I like to do
is flip to the layout of the whole month
ahead and then again I'll pretty much
just copy all of the stuff that I wrote
on my dry erase board into this month
always keep whiteout on hand because
things are always subject to change so
I'll fill out my video schedule right
here and I'll also write down any
birthdays or anything that I need to
remember for the month of September and
then along the side it says goals and to
do's and for their I like to kind of set
myself a couple goals for the month
whether it be like I said reading three
books getting into hot yoga finishing a
certain amount of chapters for that
month and all of that stuff so I'll fill
out my weekly schedule the Sunday prior
to that meet there's a little section
there to put a thankful thought and so
I'll always try and put something that
you know makes me really happy whether
it just be something like coffee or a
song that I'm really loving just tiny
little things that are making me really
excited for that week and then I begin
by filling out my wake up time for every
single day I wake up at 6:45 every
single morning except for Sunday Sunday
I wake up at 8 a.m. and then I'll give
myself usually about an hour to kind of
just chill oh and drink coffee and then
every single day again except for Sunday
I will get ready from 8 to 9 a.m. and
then the next chunk of time that is the
exact same for every single day subject
to Sunday is at 2 p.m. I have lunch so
from 2:00 to 3:00 I'll have lunch every
single day so then from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
this is usually when I will film videos
I'll go out and pick out materials for
videos like DIYs or baking videos or
cooking videos basically anything
work-related between 9:00 and 2:00
that's when I start getting that done
especially any sort of errands or
filming and then from 3 to 5 p.m.
that's after my lunch technically that
is what I like to edit I like to answer
emails anything that's a little bit more
like sitting down things like that and
then at 6:45 I will prep to go to the
gym aka 7 to 8
that's usually when I go work out and
days that I don't work out I will take
that day for a while and then for the
rest of the night to be honest with you
guys it's just kind of like whatever I
feel like doing I'll sometimes edit
during that time period or work on my
book but that's only again one of those
things that I don't schedule in it's
only if I'm feeling like it that way I
don't feel the pressure of having to do
that Sunday's kind of like my day where
I don't feel like I have to go by what
time of the day it is to be doing a
certain thing I just Zen oh and do
whatever I feel and the last one at
least off to the sidebar of the J
planner this is where I put in my weekly
- dues like clean out my car or to
remember to pay a certain bill so yeah
that's pretty much it that's all that
goes into planning my existence so I
hope you guys enjoyed it this plan with
me video I am obsessed with watching
these kinds of videos I know that
normally people that make like their
planners or videos on their planners
they always use the coolest like
stickers and they're so organized they
have these like labels and stuff and I
wish I wish wish wish I was one of those
people but for now just using the
markers and what's already in my planner
is just what's working for me I will
leave a link down below to the Erin
Condren planner if you guys are looking
into picking one up it really helps me
ground my headspace and not feel like
I'm floating around all the time and not
sure what I'm supposed to be doing a day
I started using a dry erase calendar and
a day planner is honestly when I started
getting so much better at utilizing my
time getting ahead of my schedule and
things like that and honestly it just
feels so good to be so organized and
complete I don't know I'm just so geeky
about this stuff wow that was the
longest outro of life so I'm gonna leave
you guys there I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I love you guys to the moon
and back and I'll see you guys all for
tomorrow so you Tober video bye guys
- Shu 3-carat Allah
yes yeah there's no point ahead of me
hope you know I'm cold
yeah go I am so
