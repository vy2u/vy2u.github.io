hard a lot of things lately there's so
many projects going on right now which
one of them I'm about to talk about in

use my time a little bit more widely

it out was that it's an e-book so you
can keep it on your phone go to the
index and you feel if you pick out what
feeling you're kind of having and you
flip to that page and it will give you
exactly time is what you need to hear to
talk you through that feeling this stems
from everything
feeling depressed and anxious to feeling
like happy and overwhelmed and wanting
to just kind of soak up the moment

like how it meditates how to budget
yourself a ton of things it's basically
my entire being and existence combined
as one book so that you can have me in
your pocket at all times so really like
