before and when I went to though I did
it it was completely out of focus if you
guys didn't know it was this photo here
it was like of an outfit and I wrote
that I was doing a Q&amp;amp;A also if you guys
didn't already know I actually uploaded
a couple of blog posts over the last
week but one of them was announcing that
I'm doing an e-book which I'm so excited
about so I will leave that down below if
you guys didn't already know or see the
announcement because I've been working
really hard on it and the main character
I am going to be releasing her kind of
like her description or her write-up of
who she is it's another really fun easy
way for me to create so and it's
something I've always loved doing I love
writing as you guys probably already
know so I'm just going to jump right in
and cut this intro short so Perley e-e-e
asks how long do you usually run for it
and why did you choose to be vegan so
when I'm running I typically don't go
based on the length of time it takes me
to run I go based on the distance I want
to run so what I'll usually do is I'll
run 5 kilometers whether that be outside
or on a treadmill I live downtown so the
area I live in that we're kind of on the
water so I have this like mapped out
area that I know is just over five
kilometers so I'll run that weather that
takes me on a good day like 25 minutes
on a bad day like 32 minutes whatever it
takes me I will run it that day so I'm
going to be uploading a video in the
month of this stuff November sorry that
goes all into like the vegan 101 and
such but my own reasoning behind
choosing to be vegan is also like its
health along with ethical reasons so if
you guys have already noticed I'm
transitioning all my products and such
over to vegan I'm donating a lot of the
stuff that I'm not going to be using
anymore rather than just drawing it out
and yeah it's basically because I just
don't believe in the way that animals
are treated and I don't believe in
eating death if that that sounds morbid
but that's just my own personal beliefs
and I know that this can be very
controversial so it's a very
controversial topic but it is something
that I truly do believe in and I believe
to each their own so I'm not going to
sit and like badger anyone else by the
way they decide to live as long as
everybody can respect everyone else
also at least kind of be willing to look
into it and understand exactly what
people are eating and wearing and what
you're buying into and such so I mean I
could go on for hours but I won't so
it's for the ethical reasons as well as
health reason so Rheem underscore Al
Sieber asks where do you see yourself or
what do you see yourself doing ten years
from now so right now I'm 21 so in ten
years I'll be 31 and if I had to like
look forward into the future I believe
at 31 Ryan I would be married I might
have like a big belly right here and if
not maybe I'm already like I'm already
with bit been number one at 31 that's
probably where I could see myself and
hopefully in a house by then err have a
house by then surrounded by family and
friends and just hopefully still doing
this still doing YouTube still writing
or vlogging your life or whatever like
that's kind of like Ryan and I've been
starting to move in too lately as we've
been vlogging a lot more of our daily
lives because I don't know I can see
that being something we could do for the
long haul so if you guys didn't know
that go subscribe to the vlog Channel
I'll leave it down below but we've been
vlogging a lot more so if you guys want
to see more of our daily lives go check
it out and III
K aad asks if you were a youtuber what
would you mean I think if I wasn't a
youtuber I would either be a writer or a
interior decorator or interior designer
those are two things I could always see
myself doing so Laura
browning as 75 asks what's your best
piece of life advice it's a really hard
question but if I had to narrow it down
to one solid rule I think it would be to
change your mind and that sounds kind of
funny but I mean in the sense of
perspective like the way you look at
everything the way like the way you
think about things and the way you
perceive things is going to completely
kind of mold how your entire life is so
you're a very negative person and you're
looking at everything negatively and
you're always seeing the bad in people
and the bad and things everything around
you is going to continue to be bad and
negative so I think no matter what it is
in life there's always somehow a way to
look at it in a brighter light or in a
different perspective and if you can
change your mind you can
change your entire life so if I had to
choose one solid rule or best piece of
advice for life it would be to change
your mind because it can change life
amber asked what is your favorite day
and if I had to choose one it would
probably be Sunday I just I love the
coziness of Sunday I love just like
puting around getting your laundry done
like making a good meal at home or I'm
just kind of watching shows and movies
all day and yeah I don't know there's
something about Sunday that I just love
April 1 2 3 4 1 3 asks what was your
biggest challenge you faced growing up
it was probably that I always kept every
one when I was a kid up until even
throughout high school and so I always
kept took everybody at an arm's length
and never really let anybody in and I
also just never really dealt with my
emotions so as I got older to being like
the age I am now there's things that you
can't just ignore in your life anymore
and when you have you have a tendency to
ignore things to try and instead of
dealing with them like you get to an age
you're like Kay like you actually have
to learn to deal with the stressful
things in life you have to learn to deal
with your emotions and I grew up always
kind of not doing that so it's a
challenge for me it's something I'm
still kind of learning how to do so
under just like making myself more so
numb or just pretending like I didn't
care all the time and yeah I guess I was
just like my coping mechanism I was
always like the rock I never really
liked I never needed help and I hate
asking for help and all that stuff so if
I were to choose one challenge that was
probably my biggest one growing up
because now I'm like now I'm feeling the
repercussions where it's like hey you
have to actually learn how to do with
these things and how to deal with
emotion and how to deal with letting
people in and knowing that that doesn't
make you weak it makes you strong so
that was probably my biggest thing that
I struggled with I'm noticing there's a
lot of questions about like Ryan or like
what does ride like or what do I like
about Ryan or things like that so if you
guys thumbs up this video let us know if
you guys want a boyfriend and girlfriend
Q&amp;amp;A because we can definitely do that
so Brittany Smith asks what is your top
tip for dealing with anxiety and there's
actually something I've started doing
recently that I have found has really
really helped and so I'm going to share
with you guys no matter how weird it is
or how weird it's going to sound um I
don't really care
because it helped me so maybe it'll help
one of you and so one day I was feeling
really really anxious and I was driving
home from out of town and as I was
driving I was listening to music and I
could just feel the build-up of things
just in my head and like in my chest and
I was feeling really anxious but I
couldn't really figure out why so I was
listening to the music I just started
talking as weird as that sounds to
myself whatever - pretending there's
someone beside me I guess you could say
and I know that kind of sounds weird or
you might be like what the heck you talk
to yourself but like no it actually
really helps to just say out loud what
you're thinking in your instead of just
like thinking in your head say it out
loud and I've even gotten Ryan to be
like why can you just sit there and just
I'm just going to just start jabbering
don't say anything just let me get to
the final like result of what I'm trying
to get to and then talk because the
thing is is that all the answers that
you're looking for in your life they're
all inside of yourself you just have to
like dig deep or like kind of like
figure it out for yourself so as much as
I find writing can help sometimes I'm
going like so fast in my head I can't
write down as quickly as I'd like to so
I'll make these connections that I can't
make what I'm stuck in my head if that
makes any sense so either talk to your
dog talk sit in front of the mirror and
just be like you know what let's figure
out life and that sounds weird but to be
honest whatever I don't think it is just
talking aloud of us just talking to
yourself in your head all the time it's
gonna get everything more out in the
open and help you figure it out more so
Meg Mill XR asks will you be doing
vlogmas
oh yeah I'm going to be doing I guess
you could call it blog miss but I'm
going to call it Christmas countdown hi
babe did you put the groceries away BAM
mirror yeah you should just jump in be a
plan I come to Greece yes what okay yeah
we would definitely go to Greece we
wanted to go to Greece last year we're
talking about going there um but maybe
in the near future who knows belladonna
asked do you want kids yeah lung is we
talked about it actually if you guys
watched our vlog when we went hiking the
pretty much decided our kids name
um well yeah we did what we decided our
first son's name but I'm not we're not
going to tell you guys until it happens
cuz I don't I don't want to give away
the surprise
um but yeah we want kids we've talked
about having to write no we'll have six
two six four we'll have four we're not I
before that's a lot of kids that's a lot
of kids to shove out of your body
we'll have to actually we'll settle for
two makes one zero two eight one two
asks if you don't mind me asking how do
you have money to keep up with your
fashion um I make money from my job so
if you guys don't know my job is
actually YouTube it is my main job
because I get asked that quite a bit so
I make enough money from YouTube to be
able to like supply videos with the
things that I want the videos to be
about I guess so that makes it easy so
um a lot of the times I do work with
some clothing companies so I can get a
few like items here and there from
brands for free but most of the time I
supply my own closet with the money that
I make by making the youtubes for the
video by making the videos forward to
YouTube
she has a lot of free stuff I don't get
that much free stuff I actually say no
to a lot of free stuff you would be
surprised Emily Don Elizabeth 11 asks
what is your favorite childhood memory
oh I have too many to count but if I had
to choose like I can't be specific but a
bad choose my favorite childhood memory
is probably all involved being a PE I we
went like every summer as a kid and my
the island is my family so going to PGI
all the time like being around my
grandparents being around just like my
family my sister my brother my parents
and just we all had like hung out at
these cottages and my grandparents land
and it was just so fun I just loved
going to PGI it's such an awesome area
so if you guys are in Canada or even if
you're not in Canada go is a PGI it's
awesome I took Ryan there - you liked it
really yeah I food really good french
fries really good french fries bacon 20
asks what is your favorite color my
favorite color changes every single day
um if I had to choose I'm going to give
you guys my top four
your colors they are burgundy like a sky
turquoise e blue yellow
what is your fans color and Greg h8 my
favorite color changes every day
alright good knees I'm gonna try and
pronounce this Denise eleuterio that's
pretty good
she says any plans I get maybe a sibling
another pet I mean um I've tried to
adopt many many dogs but for some reason
some of them don't work out other
reasons it just doesn't happen
but it wasn't for me she had fortune no
it's so true I would I would have a
million dogs if I could but I think
we're gonna wait until next year because
we want to get a house or rent a house
or just a place with a backyard you know
it's kind of hard living downtown so
next year I'm planning we're planning on
getting Bentley a Loeb Rutter so by
little we think we're probably like a
medium to larger sized dog for the next
one maybe a sister are you so I was
thinking brother but brother sister
better so I'm gonna answer one more
question and then be done with it if you
guys do want like a full relationship
boyfriend-girlfriend Q&amp;amp;A then again just
sums up this video because we'll do one
that's more so like us related but
decided to throw you in for the ending
of the video you're nice enough to join
okay miss underscore underscore Belle
asks how does your boyfriend handle your
anxiety and depression does it ever make
you feel inadequate or not enough for
him so why do you love thing answer the
question okay so Ryan handles it really
well um the biggest thing I find with
anxiety and just like being with
somebody is especially with Ryan who
doesn't have anything like anxiety or
depression I really have to be open and
explain to him like what it is and
what's going on and what I'm feeling and
a lot of the times he's just as lost and
confused as I am but it's all about just
having like an open conversation and
being like hey this helps this doesn't
help and
in terms of feeling like inadequate or
they're not good enough I honestly don't
think well like I've come to terms with
the fact that anxiety or having a mental
illness doesn't make you any less of a
person or human being so I've never felt
inadequate or not good enough I felt
like a burden sometimes where it's like
I'm a big burden on him it's a lot of
it's a lot for him to have to deal with
but I would never say I would felt not
good enough right now to quit because
just because you have a melts mental
illness doesn't make you any less of a
good person or any less amazing you know
what I mean so I don't know what do you
think I'm just going to be there for you
just talk about things that make her
happy and I think keep your mind off of
it it's good he's good well okay so that
is my cue a thanks to Ryan for jumping
in halfway through and helping you pick
the questions also check out down below

more like I mentioned to you guys so if
