to be sharing a few my favorite
hairstyles for hats most of these are
kind of more well-known or
self-explanatory but I'm just showing
you guys how I do them so for the first
one I'm just going to spur it be
spraying some chasm a heat protectant in
my hair because this hairstyle is
basically just some loose curls left
down and alone and I'm using a one and a
quarter one and a half inch curling wand
I believe it's one in a quarter or maybe
it's just one inch it's probably just
one inch and I took the clamp off myself
and I'm just going to be wrapping my
hair around it um framing away from my
face so on each side curl away from your
face as usual so I just basically do
that all over my head and I don't do it
in layers so it's super natural and kind
of like a messy wave slept on your hair
bed head kind of curls and this will
look good on both long hair and short
hair like I have now
so you can wear this hairstyle with
pretty much any hat but my favorite is
with my black toque and this hairstyle
is super easy and it's nice and textured
but I figured I'd share it with you guys
because it is probably my most worn
hairstyle when it comes to hats
we go
so again the second hairstyle is really
easy and you can do this with your
natural hair but I'm adding hair
extensions seeing as I have recently cut
my hair so I definitely need the length
for this one and you basically just
section your hair into three parts off
to the side and just braid it French
braid it normally down your head until
you run out of hair and continue
braiding it into you get about halfway
down and then secure it into place so
the rest of the braid it's actually kind
of like a mini ponytail you'll see what
I'm talking about
but this is probably my second favorite
hairstyle to wear when it comes to hats
especially the one that I wear in this
video so you'll see I left a lot of hair
down at the bottom which makes it feel a
little bit less of like a little kid
braid and more stylish and I pulled out
two pieces to frame my face and then
just threw this to cons over top and I
love this look with beanies as well so
this is the second hairstyle super easy
but really really cute
and last but not least I got a request
to do this hairstyle from an Instagram
picture that I posted so basically just
pull forward to pieces to frame your
face I find this hairstyle works best
with a middle part but it's up to you
pull the rest of your hair back and then
make your hand into a claw and claw your
fingers through your hair so that it's
kind of messy and that way when you go
to secure it with the ponytail you'll
get more of a messy bun and then just
pull on it and tease it until you get it
as messy as you like and this has been a
hat you guys have been requesting from
knowing where it's from as well it's my
favorite hairstyle to wear with this
kind of hat so I'll leave links to
similar hats down below so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and it gave you
some ideas of ways to wear your hair if
you are going to be wearing a hat and
I'll see you guys all in a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
