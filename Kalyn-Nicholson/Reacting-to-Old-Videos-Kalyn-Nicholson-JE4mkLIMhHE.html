all of my old videos and showing you
live reactions now what you guys
probably don't know is that there is a
whole hidden section of my YouTube
videos that I posted long before I ever
actually did YouTube they have not been
accessible for quite some time now so a
lot of you guys have probably never seen
them but that said as I go through this
video if you guys were around for any of
the videos that I show in this please

means you've seen me go through so many
awkward phases it's kind of
uncomfortable so without further ado I'm
going to jump in and share with you guys

let's watch the first ever video that's
on this channel I feel like we should
start with that one so I actually
technically made this channel in 2012
but I didn't start using it as my
youtube channel until 2013 don't know if
I'm fully ready for this you guys might
not even recognize me in these because I
had brown hair my first ever video was a
flawless foundation routine shall we see
how flawless it is I'm a little
concerned

bit first video that I actually ever
posted posted as like okay I want to
start trying to be youtuber I want to
start trying to eat you after high
school I went away to college and when I
was at college I had a photography class
that I had to buy a DSLR camera with and
so that was when I really started like I
made my first what I would consider my
first video on this channel and it was
the I heart fall tag and I have not
watched this since like that years so
I'm just gonna kind of skip the whole
thing because I'm back I would have
never watched me I had felt a and yeah I
heard fellow tech this actually is
painful and I'm going to be making a lot
more videos now College so I mean it's
kind of taking a little while for me to
get back at it

like I'm so sorry you missed me but I'm
back

I was filming in this place I was trying
to be so quiet because I room I had a
roommate that wasn't connected to my
bedroom like all of us lived upstairs I
lived with all guys and we never really
knew each other before I moved into this
house so it wasn't like one of those
things where I'd be like yeah I some
