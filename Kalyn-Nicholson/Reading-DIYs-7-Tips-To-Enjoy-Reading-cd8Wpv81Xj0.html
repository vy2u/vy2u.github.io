you guys in the video hey guys so for
today's video I am going to be doing a
really fun really different like DIY
style kind of video so it's always super
highly requested that I do videos that
are more book related and though I do
some like bibliophile playlist books on
my second channel where I like talk
about what I'm reading lately or things
like that I decided to do um like a DIY
style slash tips on how to enjoy reading
video on this channel for those of you
that might be interested in this kind of
stuff I don't know this is the kind of
stuff that I'm into so I figured I would
somehow incorporate it into my main
channel I'm also going to tell you guys
or release my 2016 a reading list for
the year so I will leave a link to that
down below so to begin let's start with
doing the DIYs
so I actually picked up this little
daybed from JISC but you could use floor
pillows you could get really creative
with this and use beanbags
or just use some cushions that you put
on the floor so I was really lucky to
find this but you could really try it
and find anything that's just like
cushiony for you to sit on and then just
pop that in a corner or again you could
use beanbags
so then I decided to grab these little
boxes but again you can get so creative
with making these little DIY nooks and I
do like recommend looking these up on
Pinterest and stuff but you could use
bookshelves on either side but I decided
to go with these because they're really
really good for storage and they're kind
of like two little night tables for my
little nook and then I grabbed this
little canvas but again you could do DIY
wall art you could get so fun and
creative and then I am obsessed with
having bunch of pillows and like
blankets when I'm cuddled up and reading
so I definitely needed a lot of pillows
and blankets and I threw those on as
well and fenty liked to claim this spot
I think he thought it was like his new
bed or something but then on each side
I'm just like popping a candle and a
couple bucks making it a little bit more
cozy and a little bit more decorated for
when I decide to sit and read and then
of course what is a reading nook without
cozy lighting so that was just the easy
little DIY reading nook that I made in
my office but again you could do so many
creative different things with this and
then as for just a couple other DIYs I
decided to make some DIY bookmarks so I
made these on PicMonkey and I'll leave
exact descriptions in the description
box on how I did it but I'm just using
an exacto knife and a ruler to cut out
but again you can use scissors you can
really simplify this and make it like
lazy girl edition if you need to and
then I'm just taking some cardstock and
some packing tape and I'm going to
laminate it myself just with the tape
and just make sure you put a lot of
excess tape on either side and then
again just taking the ruler I'm going to
mark out even margins on each side of
the bookmark and go ahead and cut it out
and then I was sure to print a doubles
of each picture so I'm just doing the
exact same thing to the other side and
using excess tape on each side and then
just cutting off the excess tape and
then you have your little bookmark so
you can just stop there but I decided to
go ahead and take a hole punch and some
yarn and create just a little bit of
like a dangle I don't even know what to
call this but like a yarn dangly thing
from the hole punch I that is like the
worst description ever but you guys know
what I'm trying to say in the space it's
me
your body and so that is all you have to
do to make your own DIY bookmark now you
can get really creative with this and
come up with all different designs and
quotes and I even put a quote from my
upcoming ebook on the one you're looking
at right now the colorful pink one has a
quote from one of the main characters
but yes so this is so easy to do and
just so creative and yeah you can make a
whole bunch and give them out as gifts
for Christmas or for friends or just for
yourself so now that you guys know how
to make the really fun DIY bookmarks I
decided to show you guys how to make
some fun DIY mugs as well so what is
reading without a good cup of tea or
coffee so I actually got these specific
markers from Michaels they were a little
bit more on the pricey side but they are
the ones that you can use on glass
without them washing off in the
dishwasher so on the first one I decided
to just do a little deer like silhouette
and then write oh my dear I love you and
then just draw some little evergreen
trees on the other side so this is just
a fun little one that I thought would be
really cute and I really like it but if
you wanted to stick with the book theme
you could really do anything with this
but I decided to go with Harry Potter a
good old classic so I'm just drawing the
Harry Potter glasses and then just
drawing like a little star and Harry
your wizard or your wizard or whatever
just writing a little Harry Potter quote
and these are really awesome because you
don't have to bake them or anything they
just once they're dry they are on that
mug for good so try not to mess up when
you're designing your mugs
and that is all you have to do to get
the perfect mug the perfect bookmark and
the perfect little Reading area in your
room or house
so now that the DIY portion is over I'm
going to share with you guys just some
tips and tricks on how to enjoy reading
if you're someone that normally can't
stick to reading now I feel like there's
definitely like some people that could
just get super into books and read all
the time and then there's other people
that just kind of struggle to be able to
sit down and read books maybe it just be
that their life is really busy I can be
one or the other sometimes I'm super
into a book and I can never put it down
and then other times I'm like struggling
or forcing myself to finish a book so
I'm going to share with you guys some
tips that have helped me kind of force
myself to read and get into reading as
well as just tips that will help in
general if you're someone that normally
doesn't read at all so my first tip is
to set aside like 15 to 30 minutes a day
or maybe every other day to read and
this could be right before bed this
could be first thing in the morning
whether you have to get up fifteen to
thirty minutes early or just stay up
thirty minutes later than you normally
do it's really not that much time and
right before bed is a really good time
because reading can kind of make you a
little bit tired so when you're reading
then you're like okay I got through this
chapter and now I'm going to go to bed
and you slowly just work away at the
book that you're reading or whatever
book that you're reading by just setting
aside like fifteen to twenty minutes and
I actually write this down in my agenda
days are like okay I need to read so
I'll write down like this day I'm going
to read 20 minutes this day I'm going to
read 30 minutes and sometimes I won't
write that down if it's going to be a
super busy day and on the topic of
setting aside a time set aside some
space so obviously with the DIY reading
nook that I'm sitting in right now um
you can find a little corner in your
house or even if it's just a specific
chair or anywhere it could be you could
read in your card everybody can have
like a spot and if you have like a
specific spot where you sit down and
read that's just like your you time your
cozy time you're comfy time so with
making like a little reading nook like
this or maybe it's just a specific chair
in your house or maybe it's in your bed
where it is designate like a spot to
reading and then when you go to there
you're just like you're already you're
cozy you're all bundled up and you've
got your book and you're ready to read
so my next tip is to find a book that
you know you're going to enjoy and
that's kind of like pretty lately
obvious but I just mean if you are real
struggling to get through books then ask
yourself what was the last book you
remember reading where you were like I
could not put that book down and then
find similar books to it and then odds
are you'll probably want to read those
types of books more so for me it's like
I like dystopian books and I also like
like spiritual sort of books like The
Four Agreements or the Law of Attraction
things like those those are the types of
books that I cannot put those types of
books down so I know those are like my
two favorite genres so when I find
anything that is like recommended by
from reading those or related to those
then I will usually probably just trust
that I'm gonna love it and get it and
then I usually read those kinds of books
so you don't know how to find like
recommendations based on what you've
read in the past I suggest trying like a
website like Goodreads Goodreads I have
a Goodreads account so if you guys don't
follow me you can but you can like write
in and put in the books that you've read
before in the past and you can rate them
and based on that it will give you books
suggestions on similar ones to the
highest ones that you've rated or ones
that you seem to have liked it'll give
you other suggestions related to those
books my next tip is might not be for
everybody but it is definitely for me in
the sense of making a reading list and
this is something that you can do so
easily I like to do it on the computer
so that I can swap around like if I
really end up enjoying a book and I want
to read the second and third I can push
my list down and add those books in but
I love having a reading list because
every time I finish a book it's so
satisfying to cross it off a list it's
like to-do lists for me I get so much
satisfaction out of doing that if you
make like a full list whether it be for
the month for the year or whatever
you're gonna get so much more into
reading because it's just so fun
scratching it off and if you are reading
a book and you're struggling to get
through it something that I find it
definitely helps me is looking up the
audiobook so there's most books you can
find like most bigger books you can find
audiobooks for free on YouTube there's a
lot of people that'll do like their own
voiceover or they will have like free
audiobooks just online so you can look
online err on YouTube and sometimes if
I'm really struggling to read a book or
I'm really tired if I have the audiobook
going in the background it's a lot
easier to follow along I don't really
see that as cheating I think it makes it
a lot easier and sometimes just more fun
if it's a really really dry book or I'm
really struggling to read through it so
try audiobooks or if you
don't really ever enjoy reading that
much you could just try audiobooks every
single time and follow along with the
audiobook and it makes it a lot more
easy to kind of stick along and like
keep your mind from like racing on to
other thoughts when you're hearing it at
the same time as you're reading it in
your head if that makes any sense
another thing that I do is I make myself
these like bibliophile
reading playlists and I will leave them
down below and drop them on a chats but
having like some soft music or like a
playlist in the background and a cup of
tea like just getting yourself kind of
put together to get cozy and just relax
and read like getting in that mindset so
whether it's brewing a cup of like
peppermint tea or putting on some soft
music or both like bring a little mug
into your reading nook and put on some
music and just sit down and read and
like getting into that kind of mindset
having this little routine right before
you start to read can also help you you
know get more excited about it just get
more like cozy and it also just makes
reading so much more fun and then my
last and final tip to like learn how to
enjoy reading more if you want to start
reading more is to find books that are
comparative to your life so if you have
you might have to do some research on
this but look up books that might have
like a similar storyline to something
you might be struggling with in life
right now whether that be like things
like anxiety or you could look up books
that have like a similar love story to
yours or things like that but when
you're reading them like you almost
relate with that character you you
resonate with that character and what
they're going through you almost have
gone through in your own way and I find
when you read books like that you're
more prone to like continue to read
because you want to know how this
character dealt with something that
you're almost kind of dealing with
yourself so those are my tips on how to
enjoy reading more and some really fun
reading DIYs I hope you guys enjoyed
