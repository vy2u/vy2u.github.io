channel and might I say it feels
actually very good to be sitting down
filming with you guys again for today's
video I have something really fun for
you guys I kind of got inspired after
filming my reacting to old videos video
so I thought it'd be really funny to go
through my old cringy and journals I
haven't gone through these journals and
honestly I don't think in the last year
I've gone through these at all at least
not my most like older ones I've gone
through the more recent one but see how
far we get in the eras of journals
really I think if you guys aren't
following you already I'm gonna pop my
Twitter my Instagram up on the screen
I've been posting a lot more festive and
holiday stuff and I've been planning a
bunch of stuff for the 12 days of camus
so if you guys have any video requests
for the holidays definitely be sure to
pop them down below and aside from that
if you guys want to see or hear my
cringy ascents written down by yours
truly then just keep watching ok so I
actually started journaling I was always
like super into like notebooks and
journals when I was a kid but I didn't
really actually start journaling until
high school tell you actually the exact
date my first ever journal entry that I
had Friday March 19th 2010 over seven
years ago is when I started to journal
face to face in person I'm not as like
sappy I I definitely have a bit more of
like a cringy sappy side to me I have
written all of it down for us to go
through I'm gonna start with my high
school journal will skim through some of
these pages and I don't even like I have
no real plan on how far we're gonna get
in these journals and what we're gonna
read in these journals but I feel like
we're just gonna go with the flow
literally enjoy all the cringe iasts of
my teenage youth to now so the first
journal I ever had was this one here
this journal is my high school journal
um it's totally not decorated
it has like a string on it and you open
it and I don't even know if they written
anything on the first page oh this
journal belongs to Calum Nicholson and
then I signed it I guess we'll just
start with the very first page so on
Friday March 19th 2010 I started my
journal entry with a quote that said
well I feel like that's such a
foreshadowing of my future when I
started it with a quote that said maybe
I will never be who I was before maybe I
don't even know her anymore sometimes
you have to ask yourself is it worth it
is it worth your reputation your heart
your dignity your breath your happiness
spelt H a P P Y and e SS your friends
your love your life sometimes we're
blindsided by what's happening in the
moment and what we want at that second
that it's too late we never got to think
if it was worth it because we were too
selfish so I asked myself is he worth it
we were you know we weren't doing too
bad there oh boy okay is he worth the
pain the time the whispers I wish it was
enough but it's not I can't be selfish
he messed up so he has to pay his words
his kiss his spell it just not worth it
and then I I I went on to to make a
hangman picture the letters are you're
not worth it you're spelt y ou you are
and dang man reads out it's too late
cherry on top I signed my signature at
the bottom you know what the beginning
of that I was like wow this is actually
really deep and methodical yeah turn
into being about a boy which I feel like
I should have known oh right oh that's
too good but a week later exactly a week
later I wrote Friday March 26 2010 poet
at the beginning says learn from the
mistakes of others life is too short to
make them all on your own
I plan many things with my life I plan
to travel the world marry an amazing man
okay I'm like 15 chill have beautiful
kids live in a nice home donate to
charity become a teacher make a change
save someone's life fall in love grow
old with my husband make a difference in
someone's life and have no regrets
that's a lot that's a heavy it's a heavy
playful I plan to do a lot the
reputation I've made for myself though
is not what I planned
I need to stop making bad decisions but
bad decisions was that making at 15 be
good to my true friends not care what
people say not care what I look like or
where stay out of the drama right more
worried about my own life
only I forget the girls who don't treat
me right be good to myself and values
respect myself focus on school spend
more time with family and volunteer more
oh look I feel like I just they got
always told you guys that I was going to
a bit of like anxiety and depression in
high school so is this like a really
weird step inside of that version of me
it's kind of odd but I mean that wasn't
so bad I felt I was putting a lot of
pressure on myself though Wow oh my god
Nick art why would oh the next pages
songs to remember okay I'm grabbing my
phone for this are we ready enough for
now by the fray you guys are about to
see how Evo I used to be I thought about
the song
good song you know I might make a
Spotify playlist of these songs oh my
god I'm gonna make a high school okay
I'm gonna make a high school they list
right now I will link it down below for
you guys
hey what's next still by Tim McGraw we
got some Hannah Montana in there oh my
god good old Keith Urban how at 15 did I
resonate with adult feelings high school
me was alone in this house again tonight
on March 28 2010 I wrote happy non seven
months sometimes the best days spent are
the ones where you just lay in your bed
clean paint and stay disconnected from
the world because those are the days
where you reconnect with yourself
I still strongly believe that Tom
freezes for a while and you have time to
forget about your worries your fears the
drama and just get lost in a world where
none of that exists and although every
hour so something reminds you that life
is still out there happening and you
feel like you're putting off dealing
with it it's still worth a few hours of
just pure joy and being yourself maybe
that's what happened will be like a
never ending day of no fears and worries
painting the sky laying in the clouds
and cleaning your soul those are the
best days I painted like layers and
layers on like my my bedroom that I grew
up in I think I repainted that one in
high school at least six times okay and
a skip few skip forward a few oh my god
I wrote a rap oh here we go
this is the jackpot I wrote a rap on
April 8 2000 if you think you faze me
you're not even close
I don't waste time on two-faced so if
you're trying to get at me here's some
good luck cuz in case you haven't
realized I don't really give up get your
own life and stop worrying about mines
rethink your habits maybe you'll keep a
few dimes and as for you Cindy Lou no
bigger than two shut your mouth cuz I've
had it with you so if you're confused
I'll give you the facts some girls are
shady
but you bitches are pitch black
now I was angry honestly I feel like you
know I'm quitting YouTube and starting
my rap career okay April 20 April I came
April 20th 2010 I coded at the tops
through music we live music is life it's
our fears regrets happiness experiences
emotions and lives put to a beat hearing
a certain song can take you to a place
and another can bring you up when you're
feeling down music is the flavor of life
it is the one thing you can rely on at
all times it brings people completely
different together and could take
something so confusing it makes sense of
it all
it can help you get over things or get
lost for a while and forget about life
music is an ever going soul within
everyone it gives us identity and
sometimes something to believe in music
is life music is life I agree Highschool
me on June 8 2010 I was loved how can a
single person have such an incredible
impact on your life it starts out as a
game sealed with the innocence of first
kiss after that it was a tie tail of
emotions feelings an unbreakable force
of nature that tied me into your every
blissful move and sparkling touch and a
short battery time a relationship people
search a lifetime for stirred up and I
found my other half I was 15
emotionally I was vacant constantly
whirled up in something as beautiful as
your kindness with children and a dying
want and knowledge of what's out in the
world and wanting to grasp every part of
it like a sponge I soaked up the love
for you I had never experienced before
and your kiss that I would have battled
the worst of hell the taste forever what
that is a good
what this aggressive I have never been
so comfortable around anyone
probably because you're 15 you give me
this thrilling high that I haven't and
never-ending require require II fourth
and for this I know no matter what life
brings I will always feel this tight
grasp of your fingertips every inch of
the way well sorry to burst your bubble
but know you won't
alright I'm generally got one there
let's get going on July 22nd 2010 I row
look up at the moon and remember someone
is doing the same legs burn air escapes
my throat as I'm taking deep breaths
thudding my feet against the pavement I
won't stop not until I reach it and when
I do all I am that same intact area
shadowing our careless Souls just a year
ago as we stared up at the stars
wondering what was to become of us and
it was this exact moon that I dazed on
when the truth finally hit me and now a
year has passed and I lay on this hill
breathing in the same sweet how do you
smell the damp grass beneath me and I
think of you and this moon brings me to
a new truth that I must find so I search
for you and once I find you you're a
different person all together and as I
leave you with a soft palate an attender
goodbye I go back to the love that I
have now and with him I look to the moon
which is shining brighter than ever and
I know I've found my truth there's some
things in this life that you just have
to let go of in order to realize that
you've got better and there's still a
million more memories to come damn I
thought that these were gonna be a
little bit more cringy but this is this
is like high school coffee talks I might
release these I should like type these
out number one read 300 books I don't
think I've done that to stop gossiping
five write a novel and learn piano and
keep with the guitar I did end up
learning piano but I don't remember it
anymore do what I want
whether my peers like it or not dress
how I want a dress never let anyone spin
ioan make me second-guess myself work
out but love my body however it looks
never do anything I'm not comfortable
with write as much as possible start
saving money expand it aside my friend
group do something big for charity not
confine not confide in my phone so much
apparently I was having deep talks with
my phone never judge what's going on in
someone else's life because it's not my
business trying to do a good deed every
day and never let myself believe that I
am better
anyone else I quoted a Taylor Swift song
at the baby top I wrote wasn't it easier
in your lunchbox days always a bigger
bed to crawl into wasn't it beautiful
when you believe in everything I missed
that song yet we're adding that to the
playlist
I feel like this playlist is gonna be
everything sometimes I want to be a kid
again back when I was pure and innocent
and my biggest worry was breaking the
crayon I didn't have to worry about what
I wanted to be having enough money
looking good and trying to make everyone
happy just go back to a time where it
was just me and my imagination when I
was so lost in my own world that no one
could catch up to me a world of
perfection guarded by a wall of love and
youth fall leaves or summer breezes
didn't make any difference when life was
a never-ending chain of Days full of fun
and nights full of dreams the worst
thing I was aware of were timeouts and
everything in my range of mind was
possible no one was out to hurt my
feelings and and every problem could be
fixed with a hug from dad life's so
serious and difficult when you grow up
that you're still a kid and the things
you miss most is being young and free I
want to go back to the field behind
Nana's where each step I took was a new
adventure and the most hurt I ever felt
was scraping my knees lesson of my high
school journal that just took me so long
that I won't bore you guys any longer if
you guys liked this video let me know
because there's still so many entries
that I've skipped over or can still go
through so if you guys want to part two
or you want me to make this a series
then we can totally do that I don't I've
just been writing my own version of
coffee talks my whole life that is it
for today's video and reading my old
journals I hope you guys enjoy my only
opinion of our advice to give would be
that as cringy as reading some of these
is it is so cool to look back and watch
kind of like how my mind set and the
things I was learning through life
changed over time and to go back and see
where I was wrong and see where I was
right or where I was like moving towards
the right things and moving towards the
wrong things like the pressures of
having a perfect marriage at 15 and with
that I love you guys to do that thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you guys all next time
