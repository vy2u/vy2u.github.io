laundry sweating I literally looked for
pants to switch into to start my blog
and I don't have any pants thought of
putting jeans on right now is not
happening the thing that sucks about
doing laundry in my apartment building
is that you have to have loonies and I
have to have like two ladies for one
load to lynnie's for a second load holy
crap I just realized that so many of you
guys are probably like what the hell is
a loony in America they have like dollar
bills we have dollar planes anyway
that's totally besides the point I don't
have pants and that's just not gonna fly
and repeating jeans on
this is the one and only thing that I
hate about winter
if I have a wish
she's been gone since that summer say
that some hip-hop mama name speaking
span bitch you want summer and it all
began you're the best girl that I ever
did see the great Larry Bird Jersey 33
where you take a sip you buzz like a
horn it really shakes beneath which you
guys remember from my California blog
and my like weekend getaway vlog as well
as my friend Kristen and her mom we're
all doing this like big gilmoregirls
party where we're bringing food and all
that so I am bringing cookie dough dip
Oh nope
don't like that at all
let me know if you ended up liking the
revival or not I'm sure I'm gonna let
you guys know if I ended up liking it by
the end of the swap it is now Saturday
we ended up watching the first three
episodes of the Gilmore Girls revival
last night but was so tired like my
sister just left so I'm going to watch
the last episode of Gilmore Girls
revival hence why it's up on the screen
right now I'm doing all of like the mom
type things today I really need to clean
my apartment and it's funny because I
feel like every time I vlog I say that
to you guys I'm gonna do my workout from
yesterday since I didn't get a chance to
get it done you excited hey I was doing
just fine before I met you I drink too
much and that's an issue but I'm okay
hey tell your friends it was nice to
meet them but I hope I never see them
again I know it breaks your heart no to
the city in a brokedown car for years
though cause now you're looking pretty a
No
no you can't
No
look as good as the day I met you I
forget just where I left you I was
insane
hey that's like running me to some
calories though it has been so long
overdue that I've been wanting to change
around my apartment but I felt so like
stumped on exactly where to put
everything
that I didn't end up doing it for a
really long time last night I just kind
of got this like inspiration to just do
it to just change everything I find if I
keep things the same especially my
environment especially the environment
that I work in
I get really creatively stumped three
other aspect of my life since I've come
back from LA has been like sky high
compared to what it was before like I'm
feeling so good within myself and so
good about you know just like how I'm
taking care of myself and a lot of other
things but creatively I was still
stumped but seriously guys like I highly
suggest such a simple project for you
guys to do if you're feeling kind of
like weird in a slump or like very
uncreative or uninspired by your
atmosphere is to change it you know you
don't even have to move around your
furniture you could change your bedding
you could change the pillow yeah I feel
like coming back from LA like this was
like the perfect second step for second
phase into this whole like new like
energy or new kind of mindset I guess
I'm trying to live by and also we
haven't even talked about the revival
okay so for those of you guys that have
not seen the Gilmore Girls revival skip
past this I'll put something here on the
screen to tell you what time to go to so
that you don't hear any spoilers here's
my breakdown of it is I read this
article that kind of connected why they
did that as the ending why that was the
way it all went is because the whole
four episodes they talked about things
coming full circle Logan is like
Lorelei's Christopher's so for Rory
that's who Logan is it's like you know
someone that is kind-hearted but really
spoiled and really rich and like means
well but isn't her true love and that
jess is her Luke
we've already watched all the seasons up
until now which tell us exactly how that
story goes so one way I'm like okay
amazing like really cool that they did
that full circle
and get the whole theme now Rory is
basically going to repeat the whole
story all over again that's also kind of
what makes me mad is that like the whole
show was about Rory
like really building up this amazing
life for herself and then I found like
the last for like revival episodes
really sold Rory's character short and I
think we didn't get to see her killing
it at life and that's like I just wanted
more for her you know I wanted her to
have a bit more of like a happier ending
and last but not least if you guys are
curious there's this new app called
tapas where you guys are going to be
able to now watch my videos on there so
I wanted to let you guys know about it
the system behind the app is that it
will recommend videos to you based on
who you already watch or who you already
like what your interests are things like
that so if you guys like my videos and
you go watch them on this app it's going
to show you a bunch of other creators
that are very similar or similar video
style similar video vibes and the cool
thing too is that it's not just for
videos like there's articles on there
there's gifts or gifs you say gifts or
do you say gifs and yeah just a bunch of
other awesome stuff so definitely click
the link down below come check me out on
top buzz and I think from there this
pretty much concludes the vlog I am like
99% sure this vlog wasn't as interesting
as most of mine but to be honest it's
the reality of my life so I've made it
such a huge you know like personal goals
and myself that I really do when I get
back into weekly vlogging with you guys
so you guys are gonna see everything
from the absolutely boring into
traveling the world and all the other
crazy things that I really want to be
doing with my life in my time you guys
could see all behind the scenes this
November a lot of things throughout 2016
have really come full circle for me
certain circumstances in my life that I
didn't understand then and I'm starting
to understand now I guess just in
general I don't think I've ever felt
more sure within myself it's a good
feeling to feel especially going into
2017 I have such a good gut feeling
about it and I'm excited for it and I
can already feel it kind of seeping into
the end of 2016 like things just there's
like a shift going on and that's all I
can that's the only way I can explain is
that I feel like I'm in the middle of a
shift I'm really excited to kind of see
where it takes me hope you guys enjoyed
this video
have to head out now to go decorate my
mom's Christmas tree with my sister and
my brother and I'm pretty sure we're
getting takeout so with that said I'm
pretty damn hungry I'm gonna leave you
guys here I love you guys to the moon
back and I'll see you guys all in
Wednesday's video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
