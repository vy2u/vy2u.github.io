and I was scared of pretty girls and
starting conversations oh my friends
what's up guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I wanted to do
a bit of a refresh refuel recharge
routine so many ours being that I am
kind of in the in-between of my
Coachella trip and my Thailand trip and
I just was on two trips and then going
to another one I'm kind of getting a
little sick and was just in general I
feel like I haven't done one of these in
a while kind of recharge your soul how
to get yourself feeling all sparkly and
good again when you're feeling just like
really sluggish and tired which is
exactly kind of how I've been feeling
last few days I am so low on sleep my
skin needs a good face mask my hair
needs a decent hair mask and just in
general my spirit is needing just a
little bit of a recharge mood boost so
I'm going to include all of that in
today's video I actually just got back
from the park that Lee and I I didn't
vlog it or anything Bethany and I went
over to the park it's right across from
the CN Tower I was snapping pictures of
Bentley which if you guys didn't know
Bentley has Instagram and put them up on
his insta so I just got back from that
because we were meeting we were meeting
the girl that's gonna be watching
Bentley while I'm away at Thailand she's
so so sweet and so they had their little
meeting and he liked her which is really
good so we did that we got that out of
the way and also this morning I just did
like my normal it felt kind of nice
actually because I haven't done it in a
while but just my normal like wake up
make myself some French press and read
my books
I just wanna know
if you're gonna stay I just gotta stand
out that I'm back off told you I needed
to recharge I'm just gonna take today to
kind of just you know recoup my life and
just get things back to feeling just
serene and calm and peaceful but also
happy and charged and all that next I'm
thinking what I really want to do is
some yoga I want to roll it went back
get some stretches done and then I don't
know I'm just gonna kind of take today
as it comes someone wrote on my and
stuff because I asked you guys what
exactly you wanted to see in this video
and there are lots of requests to make
this a long video so I'm taking said
request and we're gonna have lots of
life chats with cool pyrrole in between
and merged we're just gonna hang out
today so welcome first things first
let's roll out the yoga mat and get all
stretchy until we're feeling ourselves
again
by Luigi Wirthlin naka Jordan River
things magic Palace 7c or you've never
my mother my cat the duck face the flag
the next big steak loves game wanna play
I can feel that nothing
rumors and all of that so met with sweet
friend as you see how this earth
so one thing one really really big thing
is I feel like first maybe I should put
a little disclaimer here I feel like
because meditation in yoga has become
such a really big passion that I've
recently discovered that I've been
talking about it a lot more than usual
with you guys I hope that it's okay that
I've been talking a lot more about
meditation in yoga and I hope that it's
you know peaking some sort of interest
maybe you guys are getting into it too
and we're all kind of just getting into
it together at the same time but I feel
like I just want to throw that
disclaimer in there because if you guys
do ever get sick of hearing about it
or you want me to kind of shift some
focus on some other topics and videos
then definitely let me know with just
any recommendations down below and I can
totally do that
but that said I'm gonna follow that up
now with a little chat about with
meditation in yoga when it comes to
resetting my mindset especially I find I
have to get into some sort of headspace
like I've had it happen before too from
writing or reading or just any sort of
kind of quiet piece of something that
you have for yourself meditation doesn't
necessarily have to be sitting on a
giant floor pillow closing your eyes and
listening to like nature sounds it could
even be you painting or doing crossword
puzzles like I think that everybody kind
of finds their own sense of peace of
mind in different areas so I would
definitely say venture out and try
something try all things try everything
lately meditation has been the fastest
way for me to get there and the fastest
way for me to kind of check in with not
only just what I'm working towards or
what I'm working through in my mind but
was I'm actually on right now and where
my body's out like how my body's feeling
it my feeling it's high every day my
feeling thirsty like those are things
that I never used to notice about my
body and I never used to notice about
myself until I kind of started to
meditate and do yoga and I gave myself
the chance I guess to slow down enough
and kind of check in with where I'm at
the only way I can describe it is if
you've ever had one of those days where
like you're super emotional and you're
not sure why or like you're super
irritable and you don't know why are you
super anxious and you don't know why
those days used to happen to me all the
time
and then it would stress me out because
I'd be kind of an angry that I couldn't
figure out why I was feeling that way
and so even meditating and doing yoga
for that I find that I'm able to not
only just check in with how my body's
feeling the kind of check in is what
emotions I'm feeling and why they're
there and kind of creating the links as
to the root problems so that I can just
fix the root problem and stop focusing
on the emotion or like feeling sorry for
myself for whatever it is that's making
me like angry you're impatient or
whatever even if it's just like simple
stresses it's just like I realized the
root problem is a simple stress and I'm
like are you really gonna waste your
time being in a bad mood today and like
taking it out on the person that cut you
off on the road or are we just gonna fix
this simple stress or realize that it's
simple and stop letting it kind of
Harbor that make sense
I think with a lot of traveling and
jumping around my lack of sleep and such
can create these mindsets where I'll
start to fall into them and I start to
feel like I'm a little drained and I'm a
little more stressed than usual or I get
a little bit more overwhelmed and so for
today I really wanted to set aside like
a good chunk of time to just like really
kind of play with yoga and to be able to
just have some time to meditate and see
if anything comes up and just see how I
feel afterwards the funniest thing about
it too is like every time I go to sit
down and meditate unless I'm having like
a really good couple of days where I
feel very in flow and in line with like
the universe the last couple of days I
think I've just been so tired and I've
been trying to get so much done that I
haven't felt that kind of feeling so
when I go to throw out my meditation
pillow I'm always like this isn't gonna
work I can already tell which is a
really bad context to put on meditation
as you're about to sit down and try and
meditate for some reason I find a way to
break through that wall and even right
now like I just finished my meditation
five minutes ago and I feel I feel
better I feel happier I feel lighter my
problems don't seem so bad
instantly I can already tell some of the
things that my body's needing like my
body definitely is gonna need a nap
today I missed a whole nights worth of
sleep coming home from Coachella so I
definitely feel like it's catching up to
me now that I've been home for three or
four days I'm also kind of hungry
I'm gonna make some lunch so that's
gonna be the next thing up and also just
in general I think that I just need to
have a chill night tonight it's kind of
figuring out like it's Friday so I'm
going to get up I'm gonna make a Tofurky
pita which has been on my latest
favorite lunch I'm definitely going to
shower and put a hair mask and stuff in
my hair and then I have some work I have
to add a few things but we're gonna have
a very chill day guys we're gonna we're
gonna feel so refreshed at the end of
this video
that'd be like the same place
- since everyone has different
I did what they think is right but I'll
be doing it right are we doing it right
is supportive of this are you ready to
fight are you ready to fight cuz I know
when we succeed the ceiling and you
light the ceiling light everyone has
their own beliefs
everyone has war in peace
I hope you know what you got into cuz
ready to fight in
like
it was getting a little bit later in the
day I was doing some editing I recorded
another podcast today I was just
basically getting some work but it's
very dark in here oh my god that's so
much better
that's it no it's dinner time before I
know how to make dinner I was gonna give
you guys a little tour of what's in my
fridge because I don't think I've ever
done that for a video before I stocked
up on some groceries today to make
myself some meals from now until I go
I'll give you guys a good example of
kind of how I do like a buildable which
is what I've been using for dinners and
stuff to make bootable is every night
one of the things that I think is super
important for me when it comes to
refreshing recharging and just like
recouping especially with all the
traveling I've been doing and just being
home what about home I really really
like to eat as healthy as possible it's
just something that makes me feel really
good it's something that didn't
initially make me feel really good it
took me some time to fall into a rhythm
with it and get my body should be
accustomed to it before I actually
started to crave it I love to eat
vegetables I never crave pizza I crave
Pizza I just like if I'm gonna have
pizza I'll wait to have pizza what I'm
hanging out with friends or what I was
like when I'm with people you know but
if I'm just at home cooking for myself
then why not eat healthy on top of that
I actually have come to really love
cooking different types of vegetables
and finding different combinations of
like Buddha bowls and stuff to make and
it makes me feel so good like I wake up
and I feel refreshed and I find you what
I'm doing like my yoga I'm what I'm
doing meditation and sometimes I'll do
yoga at night too I can tell that my
body feels good when I eat these foods
versus like there's been times I've
tried to do yoga after eating like a
heavier takeout meal and I can instantly
feel like the indigestion
long story short one of the best ways I
find for myself to feel refreshed
re-energized and recharged is to eat
like Whole Foods and eat healthy food
yeah
that's quick tour of my fridge and then
throw on some tunes and make myself a
bootable look if you guys look at
general overview right now um I'll do
one of these again when I'm back and I
really fully stock everything's just
Bentley's meal prepped I've got some
hummus some garlic hummus this is like
one of my favorite favorite favorite
favorites
I feel like cuz it kind of has like a
cheesy taste to it and then I made these
little snack with Me's if you just want
to leave it open and he
have cut-up celery sticks and I did have
baby carrots tube and then in this one I
just have pineapple chunks and the next
shelf I just have some vegan butter
normally for like when I make popcorn
these two tubs are protein and fresh
fruit so in the protein one I just have
like Tofurky slices for sandwiches and
pitas and then I have tofu so right now
my fresh fruit is Kiwis strawberries and
blueberries last week it was pears and
apples and I'll just like keep again
just like stops fresh fruits and veggies
all the time so I can just snack on them
whenever I'm hungry then moving down
here I finally like every time I go to
my grocery store my favorite coffee
creamer is always never there so not
only was it there today but it was on
sale so I picked up two extras even
though my coffee creamer section over
here is already full you can never have
too much especially when it's constantly
sold out behind there I just have some
drinks for like when guests come and
then I have some pickles for the
sandwiches I've been making it this is
just my water bottle got some hot banana
peppers and then some vanilla almond
milk this is my favorite favorite brand
you guys could literally drink this
straight from the carton and it tastes
like a milkshake and I just have my
Brita water filter because the water in
this building kind of tastes a little
metallicky and a bottle of wine from
when Christine was here and then on the
bottom shelf I just have and here I like
to keep there it is it says well it used
to say fresh veggies but in the air I
just like to keep all of like the
veggies that I'm using for my buta bowls
so there's sometimes like chopped
carrots I have a portobello mushroom I'm
gonna use up tonight some red pepper
some baby cucumbers some zucchini so
basically any veggies that I've been
using for the week will go in here so
that I make sure that I'm cooking them
up before they go bad and then in here I
like to keep my greens like a bag of
spinach and a bag of kale and the
crisper I don't keep very much I just
have alfalfa sprouts which I've been
using for my bootable and then a ton of
zucchini because I'm on a big zucchini
kick which I guess could actually start
going up here because I really need to
use these up and then I just have a
Tofurky roast so I don't know when I'm
planning on having a roast but
apparently I'm planning on having a
roast sometime soon
so I'll usually just keep extra veggies
in here that I'm not cooking yet or I
haven't started to use yet and then I'll
kind of cycle them up here once they are
cut up and they I'm starting to use them
but because I'm
leaving next week there's not very many
veggies stock down there and then in
terms of my actual fridge door this just
says condiments to which I have you know
like vinegars and hot sauces and pasta
sauces and mustard and more wine I have
my coffee creamer these are some cooking
needs so I have this pineapple mustard I
got in Hawaii and then I just have my
chopped garlic that I used to cook and
some apple cider vinegar and then last
but not least at the very top I have
these little hot sauces I got from when
I was in Mexico and I actually been
using these up so much they're so good
and I have a little thing of lemon juice
I like to use to bake and cook with I
have some Frank's Red Hot Sauce that I
bought when I was on my road trip with
Bentley and then I just have some
homemade peach jam I've been feeding
like a good old PB&amp;amp;J sandwich gonna have
to make that happen
and so that's kind of like a little tour
of my fridge and then to build a bowl
all I do is I cook up some protein I
cook up some veggies and I put a base of
greens and then I usually make rice or
pasta or potatoes take a bowl and I put
all of the things in the bowl which I'm
gonna do right now
now we're gone and it's real my heart is
racing
that I feel easily
getting used to it
and we know there's no turning
my name's Raghu I just woke up a few
minutes ago I can a face mask on I'm not
sure if you know actually no I haven't
take it all night wait here we go so I'm
about to do some of my morning meeting I
did my face mask this morning my skin
feels incredible put on a good layer of
like eye cream and face cream when I
went to bed last night so my skin my
skin is feeling good and then after I'm
finished reading and drinking my coffee
I'm gonna shower and get ready wash the
coconut oil out of my hair and just
basically feel like a whole new person
these are all things that I really
wanted to get to last night but as I
kind of mentioned you guys getting a
good amount of rest last night was also
really important to me because of
missing so much sleep over the last week
so I kind of started to run out of time
last night and decided to just go to bed
and do it all this morning and I'm glad
I did because I feel so much better I
went to bed at like 10:30 I I I can
still feel a bit of like my cold in the
back of my throat I also got that new
little plant yesterday I'm thinking that
I want to name it ivory because it is an
ivy plant and also because ivory comes
from elephants let me show you I knew
you'd be guys a little introduction so
this is ivory is so cute I left out my
tarot cards from my reading last night
because I wanted to this is gonna sound
so weird but I wanted to like I don't
know leave them out with my plants and
stuff to like charge them the reading
was so freakin accurate that I can't
even I can't even describe to you guys
so yeah my tarot card reading last night
was one of those things that was like so
eerily accurate
that like as I was flipping the cards
and reading what the cards meant I was
like gasping you're in a playful mood
this morning that you even though I'm
still a little sniffily it's a little
bit a little bit up there um I'm feeling
it so much better yesterday was one of
those days that was so needed it's the
first day I've had in a while that I
just kind of took things easy and just
hung up by myself and kind of recharged
my spirits recharged just like how I'm
feeling about it I made a bunch of
giveaway boxes I got to get some reading
done and I got to get some work done I
got
get some writing done all of this the
little things that were just so simple

and a half and it's gonna be a ten as
soon as this little as soon as that goes
