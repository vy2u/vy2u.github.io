back to my channel today's video I'm
going to be going on a road trip with
you guys and taking you along with me
I actually got the opportunity to
partner with Gallade for this video they
asked me if I wanted to do a road trip
around Toronto and their surrounding
areas while testing out their new air
freshener basically the idea or the
premise behind it is that each scent
ties into one of like these secret
locations on my road trip today wow it
was dropped so the accepting a challenge
I'm going to go to all of the new places
hey we're gonna try some foods we're
gonna have some live chats I made a
playlist I have my podcast it's kind of
like gloomy and chilly air today which
is gonna be perfect for snapping photos
and as for my outfit my road trip f8 you
guys have seen me wear the sweater
before it's just like this massive baggy
black sweater and then I am wearing
leggings so basically we're taking
coffee stalks we're taking road trips or
taking live chats we're taking food and
we're combining them all into this video
so without further ado let's make a
coffee let's hop in the Jeep and let's
get going
okay about to take off I think so it's
kind of cool it's like a scavenger hunt
I get like tips on where I might be
going and I feel like the first place
might be like a bakery or some sort
we're starting off with the first scent
come so this one's new car it actually
works out nicely because it's officially
like a year old so that new car smell
just started to disappear hey we got it
give it let's give it a sniff oh that's
nice I am like I'm such a I never I'm
really bad at opening new things oh we
did it you'll be gone not bad okay so I
have the destination in gonna put on
some true crime let's do this
we are officially up a first stop it is
a bakery so I'm going to go in and see
if they have
they had a bunch of vegan stuff which
was kind of insane I got this I don't
even know what it is it looks
frightening glorious turn on that pie
this is what I got it's like a cake stir
and it's pretty much just like it's
literally a mini cake oh my god there's
cookie dough holy crap that's like
messed up that time I'm trying to
actually take a bite this might be hard
like I want to get a close-up of this
guys need to see what this actually
looks like
I believe the idea behind this being the
first stop on this like road trip
scavenger hunt might be that it's like
you know sweet flavors because it's
hiding that into delicate vanilla I'm
gonna switch this into my my little
Center which I turned it up on full
blast cuz like I'm like a big scent
person I like really strong scents so I
there's like an adjustment on the bath
and vanilla is my favorite so I'm gonna
take a bite of this switch this into the
vanilla and get going on a road trip
stuff to have like chats we haven't even
started those yet damn alright
that was so good I was like messed up
shouldn't have been that good good okay
oh it was definitely my favorite
oh yeah I have a roadtrip snack mm-hmm
done I think there's a really cool place
around here true that has like a pretty
nice view of the city so maybe we'll
check that out and then head to our next
coordinate let's do it
next place we're going is called two's
Falls I've never heard of before I feel
like it's probably because the next one
is aqua exhilaration which makes sense
somewhere with water I feel like it
might be a McCall it's waterfall which
would be really cool so an hour drive
ahead of us tango road trips are
actually like my favorite thing ever I
feel like that's one of the things that
I love about the fact that I moved to
Toronto is that I still have to take
like road trips to go home all the time
I feel like I get my best thinking done
on the road like I come to all of my
major life decisions and calculations
and have all my best conversations like
via road trips so for the last like hour
I didn't end up putting on my my podcast
I ended up going with Christmas music
stability Christmas music for the last
like 30 minutes only really just
planning all the stuff that I want to do
for Christmas this year I'm actually so
excited it's one of those things where
all of my normal Christmas traditions
going up are going to be completely
different this year like childhood house
actually just sold so we're not even
gonna be able to go like home home for
Christmas we're just gonna be weird I've
been like forcing myself to get extra
festive this year and just create a
bunch of new tradition and just try and
make the most out of Christmas this year
that's like my goal and so that's why
I've literally been listening to
Christmas music every possible moment
that I can also I can't tell if it's
literally the cupcakes or the air
freshener but it smelled like my entire
Jeep which smells like cake right now I
think over the last 30 minutes I'm like
Christmas out so I feel like now I want
to put on my podcast a beginning so
addicted to podcasts lately I don't know
why it's just like it's like a it's like
that little story time that you don't
have to like pay attention to with your
eyes you know
like I should be to the road right now
and I have I've always thought a big
obsession with true crimes but like
listening to it sounds eerie but
listening to like stories of serial
killers I don't know why I'm so addicted
to it's just so entertaining I got super
into it right before Halloween which
made sense but even now that Halloween's
over I'm still obsessed with it podcasts
start even better because you can like
listen to them while you clean your
house you can listen to them while you
go driving and so each episode is about
thirty minutes and two episodes is for
one killer so I have about you know
enough time to listen to one one whole
killer so I'm gonna go ahead and switch
my car freshener for this one this one
is supposed to smell like natural herbs
and crisp lavender notes
I mean I'm switching these really fast
too but I'm a little sad to take the
vanilla one out though cuz I feel like
the vanilla has been my favorite so far
okay actually maybe not I some kind of
smells like like Jolly Ranchers a little
bit okay so let's go check out this hike
and see
we ready neat I'm actually getting
really hungry so I'm like hoping that
there's food the next one I'm pretty
sure it's a restaurant
we are now here at the Lake Coast
restaurant and it is the last and final
destination on my scavenger hunt tour
and it's supposed to go with the
Hawaiian breeze funny enough though it's
making me really wish I was still back
on tropical vacation which I don't even
think I showed you guys the footage of
yeah I took a bit of footage while I was
in Mexico if you guys want to see it
okay work it may get all your angles
I'm hoping that this scent brings me
back to a time where pina coladas we're
a daily thing oh this one's my favorite
huh get in
it smells like I'm still in Mexico
oh my gosh I am finally home soon also
lucky wish and I didn't eat that full
cake stirrer because I want the rest of
it now so there you have it folks that
was my little tour around the Toronto
and surrounding areas you guys got to
virtually go on a road trip with me
today it was quite fun I thought it was
a cool little scavenger hunt that we did
give me you guys a little update on what
Mexico was like amongst so many other
things it is only 7 p.m. but I am so
freaking tired that I honestly think I
might go to bed look am i I'm gonna try
and push it to like 9 you don't even
realize how tired driving makes you
until you do it for a whole day also
like really pumped now that I get to
play around with all of those Carson I
think they last like 60 days so I'm
gonna have pretty much a car sent for my
car for the next like eight months so
without further ado thank you guys so
much for hanging out with me today and
in today's vlog and other than that
we're gonna go sit and bask in the light
of our Christmas tree and try really
hard not to fall asleep watching the
ranch but wasn't so tired I Drive back
out and get another Pinkster alright bye
guys
I'm hoping that you understand you ain't
the man I tell you into man just pray to
God keep you in the plan
you ain't the man to tell you when it
droplet I've been on a mission since the
day we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
