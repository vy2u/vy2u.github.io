when you first walk in this is the
general view you'll get to see I do have
double doors so I can open those up when
need be but I usually keep this one
right here shut but when you first walk
in and we see Bentley's toy what are you
two doing here
so I will start left when you look to
the left here it's just my bed area
nothing too crazy or special about it
but the nightstand and bed that I have
are from JISC
or usque and it has under the bed
storage and then the matching drawer
there which is awesome so on my
nightstand over here I just have my lamp
and that is from Target I have this
little reindeer guy here which I'm
obsessed with it's probably one of my
favorite things in my room and that is
from Walmart the candle is the caramel
pumpkin spice or caramel pumpkin
swirl and then the little kiss make at
night is from at the market place from
my town where I live I am downtown so I
went to the market place this summer and
picked that up so that's in the drawers
this one literally has nothing in it
because this bed is so relatively new so
I haven't felt it yet
and then this one here just has my
journal it has my passport in the back
there Maggie and I have walkie-talkies
so yeah cuz we're total dorks and her
bedrooms downstairs so we'll talk on our
walkie-talkies I have two hand creams
here cozy vanilla dream and crisp
morning air my remotes my old cell phone
my ID
underneath that is just another notebook
for meeting lists and then I have a
lighter for my candles and Bentley's
bone that he likes to chew when he's
laying in bed I don't know I just kind
of threw it in there so yeah that's
what's in the drawer and then this thing
right here is probably my favorite thing
ever it's from Target it's a bed tray
and I use it all the freaking time I use
it if I'm just writing in my journal in
bed or if I'm just like on my laptop or
just whatever if I'm eating in bed or
whatever I'll use that so as for my
bedding the actual comforter itself is
from Target the love pink is from
Victoria's Secret this pillow is from
society6 and it matches the actual rug
that I have there so I bought those
together and then the blanket at the end
here this blanket here is from Target
and then this little faux fur throw is
from home scents so also I get asked a
lot where my tapestry was from and I
believe I found it on Etsy if I can find
a link I'll leave it below but you can
find all different kinds of cool
tapestries on society6 too with all
different cool designs so then I just
have some lights in that corner and then
these little campus's that I made in a
video and I will link the video down
below it's just like a tie-dye video I
did and I love if you guys can't tell I
love like kind of galaxy prints or
whatever just like ombre ish and then
that mirror there that was like drilled
into the wall when we moved in so I just
left it in this room is just my walk-in
closet so I'm not going to go into that
just yet because I will do a separate
video but then right beside there or
across from there is just my little
bookshelf so above my bookshelf I just
have this dreamcatcher
I got it from a store in town so that is
the little dreamcatcher I have there and
then down below I have these three
images those three frames are actually
made in a video from my old apartment
and I will link it down below right here
I just have sweater weather pumpkin pie
and a faux plant with a plant pot that I
made in the same video so again I'll
link it down below and I
warned you guys I have an obsession with
candles so over here I have two more
fake plants with two more plant pots I
then have autumn by Bath and Body Works
and this little elephant guy here he's
made out of coconut and I caught him and
I was in Dominican with my sister so
then on the first shelf I just have
leaves and mahogany teak wood and then
in that little container there I have
jewelry one more lower I was gonna clean
that up and put it away but then I
thought no I'm gonna leave it because it
is the truth of what is my room
I actually have just a bunch of bills
and stuff and just random miscellaneous
things and then in that one there I have
just like craft glue and stuff like that
and that little grey basket there in the
Lulu's box I hold all of my sunglasses
so yeah in this box I just have like all
of my sunglasses if you guys can see
that it's just like all the sunglasses
and sunglass holders and just stuff like
that just like crazy amounts of
sunglasses that are totally unneeded and
then on top I just have like a journal a
sunglass case from play and another
sunglass case from urban planet so that
is that and on the bottom shelf I have
my collection of the Bath and Body Works
candles that I don't have kind of like
scattered out around the house or the
apartment so that is it for what is on
this first bookshelf
then just in the middle of the wall here
I have my fireplace with my TV system
and such and then a little bookshelf on
top so on this bookshelf I have a little
five-year QA I have a mug with some full
flowers in it and mason jar pumpkin
pecan waffles candle and then two
candlestick holders that I got from
Walmart and the Shelf itself is from
Walmart - and then my TV I got it from a
warehouse store that kind of has like an
over surplus surplus amount of things so
I got it from pretty cheap so the brand
is element but I have our Netflix open
and then just like our TiVo box and this
guy right here this guy is a little
elephant monk that I got from Urban
Outfitters and I just have a little fake
cactus inside from Walmart so that is
what's beside my TV also the fireplace
itself is from Rona for those of you who
might be wondering and over to the side
here I just have this Target Vey
it's just got like gold polka dots on it
and three fake flowers two white roses
and some purpley thing and then my
mirror is a bigger set mirror that I got
from yes gorgeous and then there's me in
my sweat pants so you know what else is
new so down here we have Bentley's
little corner right beside the mirrors
so it's little kennel is right there and
I never ever closed the door like
literally ever I just leave it there for
him to go in and hang out when he wants
to but he usually sleeps in the bed with
me and then he's got this little bed
here a bowl of water and a toy and this
is just where he kind of like lays down
when I'm on my laptop and plays with his
toys so that has been his little mini
corner so then beside my windows I have
bookshelves so I'll go into what is in
each shelf and I will forewarn you guys
I'm not finished decorating so don't
judge so in this first shelf I just have
a little black phase with some purple
flowers a little black bird from Target
I have the vanilla pumpkin marshmallow
candle and then just little prism this
little prism was from Urban Outfitters
and I just put fake little
battery-operated lights inside so you
can flick it on and that's what it looks
like if you like click on the switch
then on the next shelf I just have this
Pandora bag and that was from Ryan when
he first moved away and yeah so it has
the charms and my actual bracelet is
inside too and the charms that I have
are from my best friend and my boyfriend
in there it's just a bunch of like
technology stuff like chargers cords
cameras all that fun stuff and then I
have two candles here summer boardwalk
as well as just like a strawberry like
strawberry shortcake one I believe from
the dollar store so then moving on to
the next shelf I have this little horse
head from Walmart a candle from Target a
candle from Bath Body Works it's mildly
teak wood a digital picture frame that
I'm currently not
and then in the back there you guys can
see it's an old photo booth picture from
my Nana and Papa when they were super
young and yeah so I just keep that there
because I like to see it and then on the
last shelf I just have a little Paris
thing going on it's just a ceramic or
like glass paris eiffel tower from
Walmart and a bunch of candles so then
moving onto my desk this is my little
desk area sorry about the tea I was
working on some stuff earlier and I just
left it there
so this chair is actually from Ikea and
the desk itself is from Walmart and a
really easy tip for you guys if you're
changing around your room it's just to
you spray paint to add like a little
oomph to whatever mood it is anyway the
legs were initially lime-green but I
painted them to match my room so I
painted them like a baby tiffany blue
then on my desk is just I cleaned out a
candle from leaves and put all my pens
and highlighters in it and then I have
just like a little light-up crystal
which it's hard for you guys to see
right now because of the Sun but it does
change color my tea this is my laptop
and I have talked about it before where
my case is from and how I made it but I
will leave the video and the link to it
down below and then I just have my two
books here this one do all things with
kindness is where I plan out my videos
and this one is just my agenda so yeah
that's my dad
and then last but not least I just have
this shelf here some with my door so
then there's just these shelves so on
this shelf I just have a thing of tax my
two pumpkins aren't from Target I got
them last year and this frame is from
HomeSense and I'm putting a picture of
Bentley in it that I already have ready
I instagrammed it the other day so you
guys can guess what picture it is let me
know but I'm printing that out and
putting that in there and then the next
level is just a bunch of books these are
not all of my books like all of my books
are downstairs but I left a couple of
them up here or ones and I'm planning on
reading soon and then I have this little
birdcage candle holder from the dollar
store this next shelf is just kind of
random in there it's just a bunch of
medications and such and then I just
have candles and my little sock monkey
that I named deadly if you got to
remember him from a past room tour then
be sure to let me know down below cuz
that means you've been watching for a
super long time and then this last shelf
is literally just randomness like so
much randomness and I was gonna get it
again clean it up and stage it for you
guys I have like Lysol wipes spray paint
my mom's crystal cuz I got her one too
some books my sketchbook and just a
bunch of random stuff so no shame and
then I don't really know how much you
guys care about this but then there's my
waste bucket and we're back to the front
door so that is my room tour I hope you
