we are currently in a non-metal a bit
currently in LA we just flew in we are
about to go rent a car we ran like the
bus was taking it to enterprise to rent
our car that were drives in San Diego we
still have another five hours of travel
ahead what we made it so far we look for
da fireplace it's not too bad
so we rent our car we're going to drive
to San Diego and were there until the
30th and then we're driving back to LA
though
Logan's McDaniels log in service get
very very amusing starting with how the
heck do we get specific
literally fucked all this yesterday but
it's okay that's living like a moment
when they're out of standard cars so we
got an upgrade to a Jeep tell me though
that's not the universe of course we're
in a Jeep
we are officially in San Diego we just
made it to our room we are staying at
laughs oh yeah rooms a little might I'd
say basic we might not have air
conditioning but this is the whole room
so you have everything you see here is
is the room we aren't sure if we have
air conditioning and there's no
full-length mirror which is such a pet
peeve for me when it comes to hotel room
so I'll just the adventure part of the
adventure so I think we're going to like
re you know compose our faces and might
go out in the center we are right on the
beach guys we don't have the view
because we wanted to save money to do
other things but we are literally right
on the beach like mo being the
well-organized person she is pulled a
bunch of you know pamphlets so we want
to be like the wine-tasting we were
thinking about maybe doing like I
definitely not high action or kya yeah
kayak tour ziplining possibly donnelly
knows there's so many options we'll be
back with with more questions
you're on your way
Oh
you ain't enough oh me too much for you
alone baby Gunderson Davis had bring ma
know the Jets on me

and welcome back
well I guess not welcome back just good
morning so this morning we woke up
pretty early for a run I did a 5k this
morning grab some breakfast and then got
ready we're about to go kayaking just
add you know the fitness regiment of the
day we're going to go do a two-hour
kayak but it's going to be a pretty
decent day I mean the day's been it's
already been started for quite a while
now I feel like we've already been
pretty accomplished which is a good
feeling I'm going to like ask how like
comet is let's tip because if it's tips
often first of all I will not be okay
because large bodies of water terrify me
to let will not be okay because sharks
and three I will not be okay because I
will lose my blog camera so we'll see
what I can do in terms of logging it but
aside from that I'll blog pretty much
the rest of the day I feel like that's
really the only update I have for you
guys right now popping off the kayaking
and then see where else today success my
dad
get safe
we are now at the site called Michaels
and we just got a buncha tacos they
aren't here yet and looks like I have a
mustache unless unless associated the
kayaking was insane on the client really
badly every home with incredible hotel
freezes it was so cool they showed us
like weird opportunity slip we even knew
that dr. Seuss is from San Diego was not
me and we got to see a bunch of likes
more see lines and fields and also we
got to like enter this cave and my
footage of that was actually really bad
I'll show to you anyway the struggle was
real trying to vlog that but at least I
have some footage with all that matters
now we're starting off our journey of
the day we're going to like start our
lunch here grab a drink and then we're
going to go to OB and we're going to go
to PB Ocean Beach we're going to
specifically enjoy now we could be like
we're going to go beep some TV acting
like an old gold like I know what that
means
we're going to check out a bunch of
really cool places less of her old
scrubs the kayaking place oldest vote so
currently our plans but I'm personal
priorities people falling asleep
I'm not thinking about who is wanting in
the house key will be first lunch and
open B and here's a bunch of people
doing flips and stuff
good morning guys and welcome to day two
of San Diego it is currently at 9:30 in
the morning we're getting a little bit
later of its day it starts when we did
yesterday I woke up this morning he did
another another 5k it wasn't sure if I
was going to run or walk but then I was
just like screw it I'm already out here
so just went ahead and did it and then I
like sat by the oceans you guys on my
snapchat and like zoomed in on the
seagull that was just chillin so hard
and then we went and grabbed some
breakfast at like bananas oatmeal
actually a tuple bananas oatmeal and
orange juice and then some peppermint
tea we're just lets it get ready to go I
think were going to be like Balboa Park
and maybe like downtown San Diego today
we're not really sure we're just kind of
rolling with a day and I have a
livestream going at 11:00 its mo was
just in the shower and I was just like
scoping through the internet as I as I
do you know just surfing the web the
interweb and I was looking up like ways
to help elephants because I was one of
the like articles I read was about how
like the elephant population is really
different lately
then cuz I was looking up on like how to
help elephants because I was like okay
I'm reading about this dip in the
population but what can I actually do
about it and I found this this article
I'll link it down below for you guys but
one thing that it mentions and this is
something I totally didn't know mind you
I'm going on week two of being caffeine
free coffee and timber crops are often
grown in plantations that destroy
elephant habitats so you just have to
make sure to buy something that is it
has like SSC on it which stands for
forth stewardship council and that's
certified timber and certified Fairtrade
coffee so I totally didn't know that and
you guys know how much coffee I used to
drink it's making me a little sad that I
wasn't buying like Fairtrade before so I
know that my from now on like when I buy
my decaf I'm going to be buying
Fairtrade and also I didn't know you
could adopt an animal that's kind of
like what I was trying to get at this
is that I'm currently I'm currently
about to an adult an animal I don't know
which one I want to choose there's a
Snow Leopard a polar bear a penguin
koala tiger panda elephant endangered
animal or adopt a turtle guys I want to
just adopt all of them I might tweet
this out and ask you guys to help me
pick because this is like this is going
to be the hardest decision all ever I'll
ever probably make my life so that's
where our mourning is after that I'm
going to do a quick shower get ready and
then we're going to go explore Balboa
Park and all the other places I
mentioned so current update that's all I
got so far
myself in a CBS okay and for those of
you watching from America you're going
to be like okay this girl needs to chill
but we don't have this kind of shit in
Canada let me just say every time I go
to the States
I pick up my dad's really cool recent
piece of stuff like you guys have recent
pieces like many like many cups with the
pieces actually in them that is insanity
and I would have loved to bring these
home for him too because it's a big
peanut butter guy but being that I'm his
daughter I'm also a big peanut butter
gal I'm also a big Oreo gal and Oreos
are vegan and so this kind of blew my
mind
my sister and I were superior kids we
would sift our Oreos and peanut butters
so this needed to happen America this is
quite quality we are we have Canadians
are behind you a little bit in this in
our in our Oreos modulus and a banana
milkshake I plunge it up with frozen
bananas I don't really know it's our
last night in San Diego which is really
sad because I actually love it here but
we're venturing off to LA tomorrow means
this vlog will be ending soon I'm sorry
it's so long has been a lot of tacos and
like Oreo updates and I just needed to
talk about this because this is like my
childhood in a box there's an epic time
I hope I've made you all hungry
I'm here to let you guys in on the fact
that we are now leaving San Diego we're
about to drive to I think we're going to
go to Laguna and then we're going to
drive to LA San Diego's incredible is
like one of my favorite places I think
I've ever been especially in California

adventure I hope you guys enjoyed
venturing around with us and in the slog
and other than that I will see you guys
