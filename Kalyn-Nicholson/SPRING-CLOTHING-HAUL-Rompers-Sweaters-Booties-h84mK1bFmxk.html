you guys are writing such a nice stuff
on my pictures hey guys how are you I've
missed you so much I feel like I haven't
filmed a video in so long they I'm going
to be doing a spring clothing all the
time promising for you guys for so long
because I did like a big spring shopping
spree with a bunch of fun spring clothes
because I really want to get back into
making blog posts and stuff it's a
little bit harder to make blog posts in
the winter time here because it is so
flippin cold also a quick side note is
that I just bought all of my friends in
my apartment and guys I'm so excited I'm
going to be doing an apartment to Korhal
eyes request and I'm gonna be vlogging
the whole moving into my apartment all
of that fun stuff I'm gonna be taking
all bunch of footage and clips and all
of that so I'm sure you guys are really
excited about that too because I know I
am and I'm so excited to show you guys
my apartment once it's fully decorated
it's gonna be so cute I'm gonna stop
rambling now I've had a lot of coffee
this morning I'm really sorry I'm so
talkative and I'm now gonna show you
close I promise gonna start with shelf
Oh so I recently just picked up two
different things from show PO one of
which has been in one of my Instagram
photos and you guys were asking where
it's from
so this is the first dress that I picked
up from show PO this is what it looks
like if you guys have never noticed
before I'm like obsessed with whatever
this print is it's just like an ombre
galaxy mesh of baby blue baby pink and
lilac like honestly I swear to God if
you split me open and found my soul and
you looked at the colors of it this is
what it would look like this is what my
soul looks like this is the colors that
represent Who I am as a person I don't
know why I'm just obsessed with it I had
to get this dress because it was
literally perfect in terms of like the
coloring and the pattern and all of that
and I just thought it was so cute so
this is from shelf oh it's got to be I
think it's called mock nuts but anyways
it comes up really tight around your
neck and then it's got this cute little
crocheted detailing around the like top
boobie area and then it just flares out
I have to iron it it's a little bit
wrinkly but that is the cute little
dress that I got it's also got the
crochet detailing around your neck too
and I just think this is so cute for
spring it's gonna be my Easter dress
this is the other dress you're gonna be
like that looks like a skirt probably
because
is the skirt portion of the dress so
this is like a dusty rose color and it's
this beautiful material I don't even
know what material this is anyway it's
like silky spandex that's what this kind
of feels like but anyway so this is the
skirt portion of it and so you'd put it
on and then the cool part about this
dress is that the top just has two
really long bandages if you guys can see
I'm probably doing a really bad job at
showing you guys this but basically you
can wrap these any which way you want
and you could design this dress like the
top portion of it you could do it like
strapless you could wrap them around so
that they crisscross on the back you can
make it so they crisscross on the front
there's literally like a billion
different ways that you can wrap and tie
this top part the top portion of this
dress and I just I have two Maxie's like
this and I really wanted like a shorter
version of a dress like this so I picked
this up from show PO and it is the
coolest thing in the world so that was
all I had to show you guys from show PO
moving in to UM sabol skirt that is the
second place so the first thing is this
romper and I think it is going to be the
acutest thing ever for the fall time
what so this is what it looks like here
it's just got like a little button that
keeps it close towards the top and it
just looks like cotton material it's
really light and airy and then I grope
in the middle so you can tighten it and
then shorts on the bottom it's just a
really cute like t-shirt style romper I
love the material of it and I really
like this color I feel like it's really
really cute for spring this look really
really nice I like grey booties and then
like I don't know like a pop of color on
your lips like maybe baby pink or
something I just picture that outfit all
pieced together and I'm gonna make it
happen now and then the second thing
that I picked up from szabo skirt I
think this is in their sales section but
are these shorts they're just like a
royal blue with the big giant chiffon
like bow in the middle and they are this
crochet detailing and then the lining
underneath stops shorter than the
crochet so you'll see like more of your
skin color kind of peeping out with the
crochet I will try and find the link and
leave it down below I just think these
are so cute and these are gonna be
really nice for both spring and summer I
really want to get to Greece preferably
sooner than later and I feel like these
would be such a cute little pair of
shorts to wear in Greece I don't know
why it's just where I picture myself
wearing these shorts so basically what
I'm trying to say here is that I need to
book a trip to Greece
starting with Charlotte Russe one of the
recent items that I picked up and these
are probably going to be my most worn
thing for the next like six months of my
life I had been hunting everywhere for a
really really long time for gray boots
so when Charlotte Russe uploaded all
their new booties I got a little email
that said hey we've got all of our
spring stuff in stock and I was like hey
I need me some great booty so I finally
found a cute little pair these are what
they look like they're from Charlotte
Russe I love the fringe I think these
just screams spring they've got like the
wooden heel and it's just like a bit of
a chunkier heel it's got a peep toe as
well as like the back of your heel
sticks out and then it's just got all of
this fringe right on the front I just
think these are so cute and they're
gonna be adorable with like cute little
spring dresses or like spring outfits in
general okay so next I picked up this
crop top here this is what the crop top
looks like it gives you like a zipper in
the front it's a little bit more of like
an athletic style crop top if that makes
any sense whatsoever and then on the
bottom okay so then the bottom is like
this if that gives you any better of an
indication so it's got little cutouts on
each side and it's got like this like
rubber banding on the bottom so this is
just a cute little crop top that I got
it's like a taller neck long sleeve and
I actually picked these up with a pair
of pants and I thought would go really
cute with them so these are the pants
that I also got from Charlotte Russe and
okay hair this is what they look like
they're just like the looser style fit
and they go a little bit tighter around
your ankles and they're just like that
light pant material I have like the begi
kind of bagginess to it and I just
thought that would be really cute with
that crop top and then I actually posted
a snapchat snapchat story where I was
wearing those together with like neon
pink heels I think was like a week ago
and yeah so those are the pants that I
got and they're like slouchy with
pockets which it just is the comfiest
thing in the world so those are the
pants and the crop top that I picked up
and then last but not least this is the
romper that I wore for my birthday and I
picked it up from Charlotte Russe as
well this is what it looks like it might
be a little hard for you guys to see on
camera but basically it just got like
the shorts on the bottom and then it's
got long sleeves but the sleeves are all
lace and then down the middle in between
your boobs is also
like black lace and then it's just got
this same material kind of going over so
that you're not giving everybody a Peep
Show
this one goes high neck as well and I
actually wore this for my birthday and
it was so cute and I actually really
really liked it I feel like it's always
good to have like one good black like
go-to ensemble in your closet and this
one is like the perfect amount of
elegant as well as like chic and kind of
sassy and I just I just like that I like
that about a romper you know what I mean
just like it ticks off all the
checkmarks of things that you could just
want in a romper the next pair of
booties I have to show you guys are from
Charlotte Russe as well and this is what
they look like they tie up in the front
just like a wooden or style like wedge
or whatever and then they're kind of
like a suede material and this is what
they look like down the front they also
have the peep toe and like your heel
also sticks out in the back too so I
think these are really really cute I
think these are like a good festival
bootie so I'm probably gonna be placing
a lot of outfits together both sigh
behind these booties around these
booties with these booties will just say
that the next pair of shoes I have from
Charlotte Russe are adorable like the
cutest things you'll ever see so look at
these bad boys i snapchatted these the
other day too and I'm pretty sure like
40 of you guys screenshotted it again
this is what they look like they're kind
of like a suede material I want to say
that they're red maybe I'm just a little
bit colorblind but they're coming across
a little bit more Coralie red to me but
I mean tell me if I'm crazy because I
don't know if I'm just seeing that wrong
they're just like the stiletto type
he'll a little pointed toe and then the
strings here you can wrap around your
ankle a couple times and tie and
interesting these are such a cute pop of
color especially with summer coming and
for spring like these with that black
sassy romper I was just talking you guys
but I feel like that's just such a cute
little outfit so these are the suede
heels that I picked up or faux suede
yields it's both suede heels that I
picked up and last but not least for
booties I have to show you guys if you
guys follow me on instagram you already
saw them but these little brown booties
again which i think are gonna be perfect
for festival season they've just got
like this cute little like wooden style
um heel again and then they've got all
of this like crocheted caught up faux
like tan leather detailing and then
again with the strings to type at the
top but the easy thing about these is
that they have a zipper in the back
to get in and out of and again with the
pizza I feel like pizza is a very common
trend this year or maybe it's just my
own common trend this year but I'm
loving pizza and I'm obviously loving
booties so now we're gonna be moving on
to forever 21 so for starters I picked
up a maxi skirt from forever 21 so this
is what it looks like here it's like a
black lace maxi skirt and it's got
built-in shorts underneath so they're
like short shorts and then everything
else like you can literally see right
through to your legs which might not be
everybody's thing but I just find these
I think this skirt is like the coolest
skirt that I own I think it's the
coolest thing in my closet so I'm gonna
pair so many outfits with the skirt and
I am just really excited to style it so
this is what it looks like it's got a
little bit more of like the crochet
detailing or lace detailing on the
bottom and it's just like a high-waisted
maxi with the built-in shorts and this
was a 29 90 from forever 21 and it's so
cute and I'm really excited I can't wait
to find an event that I can actually
wear this to and then another thing that
I picked up from forever 21 is this
sweater I just find forever 21 always
has like the cutest sweaters and always
fun like one that just completely fits
your life and that's exactly what
happened to me
I was scrolling through forever 21 and I
found this sweater it's just kind of
like a little bit of a consultant pepper
detailing it's like grayish whitish
coloring I don't really know greys
should we call it grayish let's call it
crazy friend says Wi-Fi and caffeine so
basically the story of my entire
existence I thought this was just such a
cute little hoodie and it's so cozy and
comfy and just easy to throw on and I'm
I'm like a sucker for hoodies especially
in the springtime like we're in this
really awkward transitional period in
Canada where there's still snow outside
but it's kind of climbing up to being
like 1 to 5 degrees so like I go into
full denial mode and I stop wearing a
jacket so I really like having hoodies
and I never ever doll up on a day-to-day
basis I'm always in like leggings and a
sweater so I added a new cute sweater
with a cute saying to my sweater
collection and then also from forever 21
I picked up a pair of gladiator sandals
because I don't have any I'm not too
sure what happened to all of my
gladiator sandals but I can't seem to
find any of them so I picked up a new
pair they're kind of like the booties
that I picked up from Charlotte Russe
but this is what they look like they
have the tie up along the front the peep
toe but these ones are flat so they're
gonna be real
really easy to wear and good for those
days where you don't really want to wear
much of a heel or have like much height
or extra height to you so these are
gonna be really really cute and comfy
shoes match a and then last but not
least in forever 21 I picked up this
cropped sweater I have a new addiction
to cropped sweaters I don't know what it
is but I just love love crop sweaters
this is the one that I picked up it says
fierce I don't know why it reminded me
of Beyonce and I just feel like this is
something that Beyonce might wear so I
like to pretend sometimes that I am
beyond save so I pick up sweaters that
remind me of Beyonce just like a cute
little grey cropped sweater it says
fierce across the front and there's
literally not much more to say about
this sweater than that other than the
fact that it's really really comfy and I
just feel like my thing this spring is
either gonna be like romper or like
straight-up sweater and leggings like
there's not gonna be any chill period in
between it's just going to be one
extreme or the other I think that's it
so that is everything I have to show you
guys for the spring haul be sure to let
me know down below which item from this
haul was your favorite or if you guys
have been doing any spring shopping
yourself be sure to let me know down
below what you guys are loving
purchasing all of that fun stuff for me
it's definitely been like booties
cropped sweaters and rompers I feel like
that's been like the overall theme of
things that I cannot stop buying and
other than that I will see you guys all
in my future videos there's so many fun
spring videos coming this month guys you
have no idea I have so much planned for
you and I like as much as I can say
right now but I'm just really excited
because I've been really excited for
spring I'm so done with winter I'm so
done with like the doll cold
I just want there to be color and Sun
and just like happiness I'm not that I
just sounded like that girl from Mean
Girls where she's just like I wish we
could all just get along I don't even go
here than that I will see you guys all
in a future video I love you guys to the
Munim back and I will talk to you guys
