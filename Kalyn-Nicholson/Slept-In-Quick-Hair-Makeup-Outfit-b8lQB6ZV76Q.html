beedo beedo beedo beedo beedo beedo
beedo beedo beedo be hey guys so for
today's video I'm going to be doing my
routine basically for when I'm running
late and in total this usually takes me
about 15 minutes it's going to seem
longer in the video obviously because I
was filming a video for this so I
usually don't take as flow of a time
doing the process but yeah so I usually
start out with just doing my foundation
I'm gonna link all of the products that
I use when I'm in a rush below but I'll
just start out with putting on a pretty
thin layer of foundation and then just
concealing quickly under my eyes with
something that's easy to just kind of
dispose of out of the packaging and then
just blend it in nice and quickly and
then of course I set it all into place
as quickly as possible with just a
transparent setting powder
one thing I never skip over is brows
because I feel like even though and I'm
not wearing a lot of makeup I have to do
brows just to make sure that my face
looks defined and then I skip eyeliner
and eyeshadow and all that long process
stuff and just go straight to mascara to
make it look like I tried without fully
trying and then I use my Dior lip
product and basically it just goes to a
certain shade of pink depending on your
complexion so I like that it gives you
color nice and quick without having to
pick something out and then I just
quickly contour my cheekbones and just
around my face to add a little bit more
structure and that's pretty much it for
the makeup when I'm running late and it
comes to hair I go to two main go to
hairstyles the first one is usually just
a ponytail where I just kind of split
all my hair back with my fingers and
then just put it into a ponytail and
shimmy it up higher onto my head adding
a bit more volume to the top so that's
basically the ponytail I'll do when I'm
running late
and these second hairstyle is usually a
messy bun where I'll just throw all my
hair on top of my head stick my fingers
through it like a claw and then just
wrap the elastic around it nice and
quick to make sure that it's super messy
but still looks really cute so that's
the one I decided to stick with for
today and then when it comes to picking
out an outfit nice and quick if I'm
running late I like to keep it comfy but
kind of casual so it usually ends up
being leggings and a tank top or a
t-shirt with a tied plaid shirt just
because it's an easy go-to and it looks
cute
so for those wondering my boots are from
Charlotte Russe my top is from forever
21 my leggings are Lululemon plaid shirt
is from urban planet and the bag is from
forever 21 as well so I'll leave product
links down below if I can find them and
that is basically it for my running Lake
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you in a future video
