dramatic line
also not ball just have a button going
on in the back of my head hey guys
what's up and welcome back to my channel
for today's video I'm gonna be doing
this video a little bit differently than
usual yes I'm still gonna be sharing
with you guys my Arizona vlog so don't
worry but the whole reason why I decided
to come to Arizona and a lot of you guys
are asking me like why are you coming in
June like it's so hot and one I didn't
fully know that when I booked it because
I booked this trip a little while ago
but two I also just I heard so many
amazing things about coming to Arizona
in terms of like meditating just being
out in the desert and for some reason
that was just like calling me my main
intention with coming here was to work
on some projects but mostly to work on
myself like I felt like I needed take
Bentley with me and just escape away to
the desert and do some kind of
soul-searching just some tuning up
inside you know and it's weird because
when I got here even though I was
meditating a lot and doing a lot of yoga
that you'll see in this video I did a
lot of journaling I really did feel like
I'd ov into just like my inner workings
lately and just how I've been feelings
and things that have been changing in my
life I also felt this overwhelming
pressure to kind of and and by all means
I was puttin it on myself but I felt
this pressure to do Arizona right and to
kind of capture this vlog that would be
like super fun and super uplifting and I
kind of unknowingly and I only really
discovered this last night because last
night was the most enlightening night of
this whole week but even when I was in
Thailand too this happened a little bit
but I was pulling away from my
experience because I felt this pressure
was putting this pressure on myself to
capture the experience rather than to
enjoy the experience you know I did
still have tons of fun I loved Arizona
and I'm definitely gonna be coming back
I did not get to do Sedona and I want to
do it photographer I met back in
Nashville she was telling me to to go
check out this like Natural Bridge so
first of all definitely gonna be coming
back and coming back in the colder
months so that I can explore more I
think that was trying
to balance capturing the footage and
capturing the vlogs but also working on
myself it was almost like a giant
metaphor for what's been going on
even back at home with my life
especially last night I can't explain to
you guys I just had this overwhelming
feel diving into how I feel and just
really pulling things up to the surface
and dealing with them and I needed it so
bad so with that said let me start by
showing you the journey of the Arizona
vlog and then we'll wrap it back up
right here with my end conclusion on the
soul-searching I did in the desert over
- I don't wanna no no no no loving you
Sol Sol Sol Sol way I used to love you
no I don't wanna know no no no who's
taking you home oh oh
my loving you so so it's also the way I
used to love you or I don't wanna know
where did more I drink the more
where are we just literally picked up
our car five minutes ago I'm in a
Walmart parking lot updating you guys
and letting that link ope I don't know
what 91 degrees Fahrenheit is in Celsius
because I'm a Celsius Canadian I'll pop
it up on the screen we aren't coming
back to Tucson we're just going to
Phoenix first hopefully that gets us
there around 3 or 4 this was Bentley's
first time flying it you were so good
and now we're about to make our trek to
maybe to Phoenix come here oh yeah you
made it to another new clone first
things first
it is so freakin hot out might not look
the question of the change but I'm gonna
dress now second I'm gonna go see if
there's like a grocery store or
something nearby we need to get the
essentials you know coffee vegan coffee
creamer that leaves dog food like
legitimate just food in general because
I'm thinking work tomorrow night and
make a dinner here but either way I'd
rather like grab some stuff even for
breakfast and lunch tomorrow and second
things second now this incredible place
called sprouts it was like a food market
farmers market type of thing every time
I come to America it blows me away the
vegan options you guys have here maybe
does a little a little mini hold of some
stuff I got today we got two spiral
noodles watch this by removing kimchi
I'm obsessive kimchi right now spiral
noodles coffee because priorities should
carrot gaining base I have been wanting
to try this
ever since I've watched cowspiracy maybe
but it's the guy that wants to be on me
I'm gonna try to be on meat chicken
he'll marry cookie dough bites this
caramel sea salt it was really clearly
made with coconut oats and nuts maple
syrup that's some pop chips that was
snapped on be good to go I'm gonna go
get tacos tonight go look through my
list of restaurants that Zoe helped me
find an apple fruit just randomly stuff
now I'm not even telling you guys
anymore oh my god this I got this on a
road trip from Bentley and I went to
Florida and so I had to pick it up again
Jesus I can't find it in Canada you can
only find like the vanilla one the
caramel one was the one that I got the
olive bar got some shish kebobs
strawberries that lots of stuff I'm
gonna head to dinner in about an hour
I'll just cut to that be
where can I do this oh oh this lighting
works what's up last night I decided I
was just having a moment I was doing my
Tarot and I decided that each day I kind
of wanted to theme my sort of personal
whatever for every single day so that by
the time I go home I've fully released
all the things that I want to let go of
this would have been kind of almost like
my own little retreat last night was all
about the things I was letting go of
things in my life that just no longer
served me and today is all about self
love I woke up today and I read drank my
coffee and I felt so well rested this
morning I feel so vibrant today so today
and with it being about self-love I want
to just kind of do what I feel inspired
to do and do what makes me feel good
work is doing something I'm passionate
about and so today I am going to head
right now I just finished filming that
video there's this place called flower
child where I want to go grab a bootable
then once I get back I'm gonna edit and
then we're gonna go for a little sunset
hike and just kind of focus on with
letting go what I needed to let go of
what I want to replace those things with
good habits good mindsets good
perspectives and just kind of you know
just taking a day to work on some of
that stuff I was meditating last night
outside blistering hot and just so
sweaty
and then when we were driving to and
from the restaurant to eat I was
listening to I made a new playlist it's
I don't know if it'll be out yet but
it's a different summer playlist that
music that gets you like staying kind of
up late or just thinking about life it's
kind of like a vibey playlist I was
listening to that the windows down and
it's just cue a good-ass bootable and
the rest of today let's go
most beautiful things I think I've ever
witnessed in my life
so I walked up and made myself a coffee
and I've just been chilling not too hot
this morning it's supposed to get very
very hot today basking in the Sun this
morning with Bentley and I've been
keeping you guys up to date on the whole
each day kind of having a different
theme today's theme is all about kind of
exploring having fun
theme or motto today it's to say yes to
everything make a memory and basically
create an adventure I was looking up
things to do in Phoenix I was thinking
of taking Bentley downtown since I
haven't been downtown Phoenix yet come
back here and then a meeting with a
photographer I think around 3:30 there's
this cool place he mentioned called the
two hippies and it's like a Volkswagen
van and I'm like yes we're gonna go
shoot some photos there just the other
day I was saying to a friend of mine I
was like I want to see maroon 5 so bad
and concert a or literally the epitome
of a summer vibe I'm like well things to
do in Phoenix
boom boom fives playing tonight that's
an adventure that's making a memory but
saying yes and it's just like that
sounds like so much fun
I got general admission too so I'm in
the pit so that way I can just like
dance around and just like not care that
I'm not with anybody I'm gonna challenge
myself today to go to a concert by
myself it's gonna be different I'm so
excited
and then tomorrow we leave for Tucson
we're now in Tucson and we got here a
few hours ago I wanted to verbally
update you guys this morning but I was
working and then got here was still so
tired I even though I got home
relatively early last night so I went to
bed at like 11 ish 11:30 and we made it
to this Airbnb I pretty much just took a
nap woke up headed the Trader Joe's
grabbed some stuff to make dinner
tonight I'm gonna make some noodle bowls
and some tofu spring rolls I also picked
up some kombucha and this one is the
synergy organic kombucha trilogy
it says renew backward balance rebuild
reclaim rekindle and recharge my sister
got me on kombucha I didn't like it the
first few times I tried it but then when
I was with her I bought it on tap
actually at the flower child place that
you guys saw on this wall she got me to
get it on tap in Toronto and now I'm
like obsessed thumbs up okay that one's
good Wow
oh it says do not Shae definitely shook
it I wanted today to be more about kind
of checking out I've been trying not to
be on my phone so much which has been a
bit more of a struggle but tonight I
definitely want to take a break from my
phone don't in I have some stuff to work
on some projects to work on but there's
like a month left before catcher comes
out it's oh my god but also outside let
me show you ten things out here right

freaking an amazing like can we just
definitely gonna take a photo in front
of that tomorrow so yeah like I said I'm
just going to kind of have a bit more of
a Zen night today class I'm really
excited to kind of cook a really good
beautiful the place that I went to today
was called the urban fresh it was so
good but I feel like I might want to try
like challenge myself to do like a week
of raw foods or something I feel like
that would be a really fun video and see
if it makes any difference slowly just
cuz I'm curious like I know that there's
a lot of people that do the whole raw
thing there's so many I feel like
there's so many recipes I could play
with so if that's something you guys
want to see
let me know definitely feel like it
could be a really fun challenge that
said the stuff that I grabbed for
tonight is to make like a giant yummy
bootable she kind of want to cook some
good foods just kind of Zen out so I'll
put on some good you know chill music
give you guys some vibe me b-roll and
we'll just let it be roll into tomorrow
that was a really bad joke that was like
a dad joke literally let it roll it
good morning and welcome to our last day
in Arizona are you sad I'm a little sad
update you real quick so it's currently
about 9:00 9:45 in the morning I just
got back from pressed I went and checked
out this place it was like a little cafe
and planned out all the work I need to
get done when I get home this week I'm
feeling very inspired and my creative
juices are flowing again which is
exciting because when I first left for
Arizona I was like I have so many
projects on the go right now that it's
easy for me to burn out sometimes
feeling just a little bit burnt out and
now I'm like okay I'm ready the plan for
the day is we're gonna head to the
Botanical Gardens one you can bring your
dog there's this place called cashew cow
but the guy that works at urban fresh
told me about it's all vegan ice cream
so I'm thinking of hitting that little
opps for Bentley because is instigating
has been poppin since we've been here
roll the tape
all my carpet in my basement silence pin
the roof like a cigarettes and makeup
make don't get us high like they used to
so many people
try try to make things right
oh it's coming to work
you just
me and you cheated that you
messed up cuz I need
with too quiet let's start screaming
just said
so as you guys can see as you could
probably tell I had a ton of fun ate a
bunch of amazing food for real and so
taking it back to last night I had this
overwhelming feeling this is your last
night here this is your last chance
before you go back home to really lay
everything out on the table when things
are bothering me I tend to harbor them
up and suppress them down until they
kind of overflow and yesterday I felt
very irritable
I felt very I can't even describe the
way I felt I was just running a million
hamster wheels in my mind and I felt
kind of scattered I'm working on a ton
of different projects right now trying
to do a million things at once and when
we try and do that we branch our focus
and we branch our ability and our
capacity to be present in a million
different directions I'm a very
sensitive person I get overwhelmed a
little easily sometimes I deal with
everything on my own and I love to deal
with things on my own but it also makes
it so that sometimes I can be my own
worst enemy and not allowing myself to
just feel the way that I feel like I
must try and force myself out of feeling
annoyed or out of feeling angry or
stressed out or whatever so I turned off
all my technology last night and I
decided to just sit outside staring at
the stars there's like a mountain right
there to that I was just like looking at
and I was just like you're gonna sit
here until you let everything come up to
the surface and you deal with it and it
was the most I've never done I've never
dealt with something that way before and
it was honestly let me tell ya thing has
definitely boiled to the surface hey now
I know so I can let it go everything
that boiled up that I didn't even
realize I was feeling because I'd
suppress it so far down when it came up
I was like now I know and now I choose
to let you go that is what I mean when I
say it was one of the most enlightening
experiences literally just scorching
sweat because it was so hot even in the
night guys I fell into a trance I slept
for like 11 hours last night
I can't think oh my god go to the desert
if you need to like get some get some
things off your chest and if you can't
go to the desert just sit down and tell
yours
if you're not allowed to get up until
you feel everything you need to feel and
get it all out when we have things
lingering above our heads we don't deal
with them they become our fears and our
fears become our limitations and our
limitations become our anxieties because
then we seclude ourselves to this safe
space and that is a really bad habit of
mine and so I think it's so important
every now and then to just sit and feel
the way you feel it's okay to be
frustrated it's okay to be disappointed
in other people in yourself and when you
face that feeling and you own it you can
then say okay now I know why I feel this
way and now I can let it go now that
it's boiled up to the surface I'm
choosing to let this go you will
literally feel it melt off of you mind
you it was probably the sweat melting
off of me so that is why this vlog is
being filmed a little differently that
is why I wanted to say and kind of
preface and conclude this vlog this way
in a weird way you guys just kind of
watched the journey I was going through
from beginning to end
yeah so with that I hope you guys
enjoyed this Arizona vlog Bentley and I
have about a few hours before our flight
but we need to check out of this air B&amp;amp;B
so I'm gonna go back to that patio try a
different meal there read a bit more of
my book and then we're gonna hit the
flight back home and I will see all of
you guys back in the lands of Drake and
Canadia
bye guys
you thought you let me did you when you
lie to my face I could see the truth
every step of the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
