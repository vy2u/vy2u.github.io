look I can't get ready right now so
you're getting me on my Saturday morning
best first of all welcome back to my
channel for today's video we are doing
the third and final video in my spring
cleaning series if you guys didn't see
the other two I'm going to link them
down below and the first video we moved
things around and got like a new feel in
the second video we redecorated and did
some DIYs and then in today's video this
is like the finishing off not only like
the reorganization and the labeling but
I'm also going to be doing some spring
bucket-list stuff in this video with you
guys it's gonna be a very spring video
it's all I'm getting that kind of out of
my apartment for over a week now I'm
ready to commit myself to this mess we
give you guys let me show you guys what
I'm working with okay so first things
first this room is just like like
there's just stuff take everything down
all my furniture is like over here and
just basically they needed to do work in
the kitchen and the two bathrooms so
everything is just so messy it's so
dusty that's what we're working with we
have a lot to do if anything is kind of
just giving me an opportunity to really
go through everything I've been really
into the idea of minimizing my lifestyle
and just like only owning the things
that I actually use and now that I'm
back I'm ready to whip this apartment
back into shape get back into a spring
mood just refresh like hit the refresh
button put everything back in its spot
starting with furniture so first what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna clean the
sweep I'm gonna mop and then I'm gonna
move up my furniture back and then I'm
gonna start you know organizing and
labeling if I don't verbally tell you
guys what I'm doing I will pop it up on
the screen and let part three
commenced oh my god didn't take me so
long
the day is warm
a northern clouds pain storm she's late
July I'm falling in love with the summer
sky distant thunder
never sound it's so good before July may
I
asked you to steal why
her legs alone
long like a sixties Motown song high as
they shine
they shine like a fancy glass
lovely
could only tribe also July me
groans alone
she said
away
she says goodbye
she's walking out the door
[Laughter]
so we are now done the organizing and
the cleaning portion of the spring
cleaning I can't believe it's finally
done I feel so cleansed I feel so Zen
just even opening my fridge right now or
pulling open cupboards I'm like I feel
like Monica Geller would be proud so
really quick before we jump forward I'm
gonna be sharing with you guys my spring
bucket list but there's still a few
things that I want to check off going
over it right now I'm just seeing what I
still have left to do paint with
watercolor plant a garden baked pancake
donuts grow vegetable read five new
books go on a spontaneous road trip do
yoga in the sunlight spring clean and
refresh my apartment go to a farmers
market and get a tarot card reading I've
obviously it's on my whole garden series
behind me with you guys I also just got
a new plant today to which I asked you
guys on insta if I should name him
Marley or Arlo and guys have it on 5050
right now this is him
anyways let's when you plant family so
that one is done I did bake my pancake
donuts
I spring cleaned and refresh my
apartment I booked a spontaneous road
trip which if you guys haven't seen my
plan with me yet I'm doing quite a few
trips actually in April but one of them
is a road trip that I've planned with
Bentley quite spontaneously read five
new books to finish take her powers and
now I'm reading the power of now grow a
vegetable to which we're gonna get to
we're gonna plant my cilantro herb paint
with watercolor still have to do that go
to a farmers market which I'm gonna be
doing on my road trip yoga in the
sunlight and a tarot card readings and
get a cute spring bite I actually got an
email notification that my bike is ready
to be picked up so pick up my brand-new
bike share with you guys cuz I'm gonna
need your help
naming it and then I'm gonna try and
check off as many things left on my
spring bucket list to the rest of this
videos
planting some cilantro and let's let's
do all the spring things shall we
three little birds sat on my window and
it's only I don't need to worry Sam
became like cinema so sweet little girls
double dots and a concrete maybe
sometimes we've got it wrong but it's
alright
the more things seem to change the more
they stay the same
oh don't you hesitate girl put your
wrinkles don't tell me you favorite song
you go ahead in your hair down sapphire
faded jeans I hope you get your dreams
just go ahead let your hair down you're
gonna find yourself somewhere south well
Wow feeling very spring accomplished now
actually got a lot done off my spring
bucket list it's people mind that I
haven't painted in a very long time if I
put a little bit more time and effort
and practice into it I feel like I could
create something a little bit better I
also planted up my little cilantro buddy
but we have to name him if you guys can
think of anything pop it down below I'm
like impatient about it I'm like Kay
grow like why haven't you grown yet
sprout Solange was like my favorite
herbs so to be able to actually like you
know season a dish with cilantro that I
grew myself I feel like that would be
one of the most satisfying feelings
check that off the bucket list I cooked
some more pancake doughnuts which the
recipe will be going up on my blog on
Friday so definitely watch out for that
I'll be posting it to my Twitter my
Instagram once it's live so definitely
check that out I'll leave links to those
things down below so you guys can be on
it with the pancake donuts you need you
need a pancake joint in your life I've
had one this morning was my coffee and
when I was reading my book and like
dunking a pancake donut into your
morning coffee I've been eating it and
it's so simple the juice of the one oh
my gosh it'll change your freakin life
the pancake doughnut is this random
invention that I came up with nice too
lazy to make donut dough and figured why
not try pancake mix update it works so
there's still a few things on the bucket
list that I'm not gonna get to in this
video but they're gonna be in upcoming
videos obviously the spontaneous road
trip belly and I leave not tomorrow but
the next day so hopefully gonna get my
sunshine yoga in
that way and getting fresh fruits and
vegetable market checked off the list on
that road trip but as for a tarot card
reading I'm gonna finish off this vlog
doing a little tarot reading myself I've
been seeing some requests to talk more
about it so we're gonna finish the vlog
off with that when I get back Kat and I
are actually gonna go to the rock store
and get like actual readings done but I
figured for the sake of this vlog I
would pull some cards with you guys and
because I haven't done a tarot reading
in a few days maybe the universe has
some backed up messages to send me every
time I go to do a tarot reading I always
just kind of do whatever feels right in
the moment like for instance for some
reason I'm feeling like I need to
shuffle four times so I'm going to
shuffle four times and any time that
happens I've started picking out cards
that do that so while I was shuffling up
any card flips over and jumps out at me
I take it out of the deck and I figure
out what it means because the seven of
cups which I don't think it's a good I
don't think that's a good indication
then I'm gonna split the deck into three
and then combine them so first things
first I want to find out with this why
this jumped out at me it's seven of cups
still working on memorizing the stack so
I have to go to my guide book to figure
out what switch means Kim Krantz she
said she doesn't really do the whole
flipped upside down card thing
when this card jumped out though it was
flipped upside down sometimes me and
that it's the opposite meaning of what
card it means itself so right-side up
seven of cups it usually means illusion
and deception the seven of cups is not
the most welcomed card indicates you'll
face temptation in many aspects of your
life you'll soon realize that you've
been building a house of cards and you
need may feel as though you can't see
clearly can't judge right from wrong up
from down this is the spell of the seven
of cups it's best to remove yourself for
a while step back until you can see
straight again but that's a little
alarming I'm actually reading I'm gonna
pull two cards I want to know the route
of where my life is I and the direction
that my life is going so those are the
two cards that I want to pull right now
that's what's popping in the head so the
two cards that I pulled for the route of
where my life is that right now I pulled
the father of ones for the direction my
life was headed I pulled the moon I love
this stuff
like I love it but I'm such a beginner
so I find it really cool whenever I talk
about this stuff in videos some of you
guys are experts at this stuff give me
such good Intel and information so let's
find out what my reading says shall we
father wants is what I pulled for the
route of where my life is at right now
so lawns are actually ruled by fire and
they represent your inspiration in your
creativity in relation to your ambitions
goals and dreams so being that it was
the father of swords the actual reading
itself means charismatic and creative
the father of Wands is a man of mystique
and charisma others are drawn to him
naturally and he welcomes them with an
open and loving heart usually you'll
find him involved in the healing arts as
he's deeply compassionate and in tune
with life in nature he is able to hold
steady and still during conflict so that
is apparently the root of my life right
now and then in terms of the direction
my life is heading I pulled the moon the
moon means of vivid dreams and fears in
many ways the moon card encompasses the
idea of the wild unknown it is the
shadow realm the place where dreams
fears and mysteries are born but
darkness can linger here and if you
aren't careful this can lead to periods
of anxiety and self-doubt many great
artists have roamed this inner landscape
it's where imagination and creativity
drift freely upon the midnight air
basically my life is headed in a
creative way but just be careful very
interesting I pull to two cards with
moons on them if any of you guys are
tarot card readers help actually so
excited to bring my tarot deck with me
on this road trip and will touch all the
rest of this bucket list in the road
trip vlog but aside from that
that completes our spring cleaning
series got some sense over so even
though this spring cleaning series is
officially complete I'm still gonna be
doing a lot of spring content on my
channel videos will still be going up
