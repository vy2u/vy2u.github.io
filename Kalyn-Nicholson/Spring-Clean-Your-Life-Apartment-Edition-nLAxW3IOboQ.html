I'm coming for your farm I'm coming for
your heart because anything goes I guess
I'm Josh
you're scared because somebody comes up
for the morning so yet oh that was a big
yawn I thought it would be a really cool
idea to vlog a little how to spring
clean your light educating today to like
getting things done feeling reorganized
tackling a bunch of tasks refreshing my
entire existence I'm going to bring you
guys through all of the little steps and
things that I'm going to do today to
kind of freshen up my life for spring so
it's still pretty early it's 9 am I woke
up at 8 o'clock but I had some work to
do on the computer that I made a nice
little list back there of all of the
things that I want to try and get done
today and it starts with taking this
little guy / waa okay if I say the word
right now he's going to go bananas and I
don't have pants on so I'm not regular
banana yet
Oh
okay hello we're back so I actually just
had to the grocery store after taking
Bentley for a walk and picks up a crap
ton of cool meaning supplies first thing
I think of when it comes to spring
cleaning is well duh cleaning actually
one of those people that find cleaning
weird be therapeutic so usually I keep
pretty on top of keeping things clean
but I haven't done like a good thorough
like baseboards bath tub pretty much
since I moved in here so I picked up a
bunch of materials I'm going to play
some like sweet beads put on something
like fresh and airy for spring I'm going
to open up the patio doors fail the
patio doors get some fresh air in here
and clean the crap out of this apartment
the old lady and me has never been more
excited
you
you
I'm officially done cleaning although my
bedding is still in the laundry I have
to do a load of towels as well but I'm
pretty much done say a little Enlil
friend instead of neil clapping lately
I've been doing this new thing where I
actually food prep instead of meal prep
being that I am vegan and that I just
like to eat a lot of vegetables and
starchy goods I find it so much easier
to food prep rather than meal prep so
what I end up doing is I spent like a
few hours yesterday just cooking up a
bunch of food I cooked sweet potatoes
tofu asparagus roasted vegetable roasted
eggplant like I'll basically make like
nine to ten different things I cut up a
bunch of cucumber I prep a bunch of
different things so that I can then make
my own custom bootable every day to make
my base salad like I did today or rice
or quinoa and then I throw in potatoes
and whatever vegetables I want and then
today I put apple cider vinegar a little
bit of salt and pepper
and some balsamic glaze but other days
I'll put mustard I'll put comments and
so that's the salad I'm having today it
keeps me eating so healthy but it also
makes it so that every time I'm hungry I
can make a different Bowl each time and
every time I grocery shop I buy
different vegetables but every single
time is different it's like my new
obsession and it's especially good if
you live alone so I'm gonna start this
salad down and get some work done while
I eat the salad I'm actually going to
clear out my email clear out like the
storage on my iMac and do all of that
fun stuff so that would be another good
tip for spring cleaning your life all of
your pictures all of your storage and
clean it all out that is going to be my
next project as I eat this salad
I'm officially done cleaning which is a
good feeling because I've been cleaning
for I'm not kidding you guys about four
hours my bedding is now in the dryer
it's almost done being dry so I'm just
waiting to put that on my bed I'm just
throwing some dr. Phil and made myself a
macho obviously you guys know I'm
obsessed with my coffee but lately I've
been like really digging matcha teas
again if you guys don't know what matcha
is it's basically just roundup green tea
leaves got like 10 times the
antioxidants of just normal green tea
it's like it's incredible s it looks
great any time you drink anything that's
green you just feel instantly healthier
so next I'm just going to paint my nails
I figured since we're doing some spring
cleaning why not paint our nails and my
spring colors long-term forever 21 I got
this like forever ago it's in the color
princess put this gel coating on top
they're like aggressively chips right
now I was going to do a workout on
camera with you guys but I actually have
soccer tonight at 6:00 so instead I
think I'm just going to let soccer be my
workout how I'm going to unmute dr. Phil
find out what he's got to say about life
right now and paint
so there were a few things that I want
to get done in the spring cleaning like
seemd vlog but I totally ran out of time
and didn't get the chance to so before i
top off this vlog i'm thinking maybe we
could make this a series for spring
where we spring clean the crap out of
our lives so in phase one cleaning the
entire apartment really helps me cleanse
my soul from being honest and just like
adding a few new things like the plant
the new lamp and just tiny little things
it honestly makes the world of a
difference I woke up this morning and
just have like a complete new energy
from the exact same space I was in just
the day before it it's super corny but
I'm a strong believer that like you
generate energy from your environment of
you're feeling low and you're not
feeling yourself or you're needing some
change or some inspiration in life I
highly suggest you change where you tend
to spend the majority of your time so
phase one of spring cleaning my life is
complete outlet if you guys want a Phase
two three four we could just keep this
going for the hole Springs we really
want to then just thumbs us up or leave
a comment down below if you guys have
any specific ideas I'm thinking I can do
like a spring cleaning meal prep and
working out or like good habits to pick
up for the spring an outfit or closet
version we could just there's so many
things we can do
April is going to be a crazy month I'm
going to be traveling a lot this month
so there's going to be so many really
fun vlogs coming up that we didn't have
a bad winter it felt like it lasted
forever so I'm welcoming April with open
arms I have a bunch of dream catcher
updates coming so I'm going to leave you
guys there after generating all that
hype so you guys know that there is a
ton to look forward to this month I am
very excited Corner if that's how the
guy came up with uber and other than
that I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I love you guys to the moon and back and
I'll see you guys all on Wednesday
bye guys
