my channel for today's video we are
doing the first part and a two part
spring cleaning series that's starting
today guys I put off this whole spring
cleaning thing for as long as I possibly
could the sun's been coming out the
temperature is been rising and like I
just I can't wait any longer
plus my apartment was feeling like such
a hot mess I'm so easily affected by my
atmosphere and everything just started
to feel really sluggish I like I
couldn't concentrate I couldn't get work
done and it felt like it had just been
way too long since I had kind of move
things around gotten like a new feel a
new vibe and I wasn't now I'm only
halfway done but things are getting
mighty exciting so if you guys are
wondering this 2-part spring cleaning
series starts today today it's all about
getting like a new vibe a new feel for
your space and also decluttering and
getting rid of things that you no longer
need and part two will be all about
redecorating and DIYs that you can do
for the springtime the end of this video
I'm going to be giving you guys a
updated apartment tour so you guys are
gonna be able to see this apartment
possibly potentially for the last time
although you'll see it in part two this
is gonna be a look at the last tour I
think for this apartment it's the
overwhelming feeling that I have I feel
like I'm not gonna be here very much
longer I think that and redoing the
place for the spring and getting a whole
new feel to it will make it so that I
can you know nestled in for a few more
months but I'm starting to kind of scope
out see what my options are and see what
I might do next
so that said you guys are gonna get an
updated apartment tour of this place and
you're gonna get to see kind of you know
a little mini routine I do when it comes
to moving things around decluttering and
reorganizing everything you'll need to
know will be hot down below including
that my Twitter and my Instagram and my
blog on there I'm gonna put a little
template to follow along if you guys
want to spring clean at home so with
that said if you guys want to see an
updated apartment tour it slash start
your spring cleaning with me and then
just keep watching okay so I'm starting
off with this I just basically took my
bullet journal and mapped out the two
different bedrooms that I'm changing I'm
basically switching my bedroom back into
the master bedroom and
my office back into here kind of themed
each room so this room is going to be
themed as like an office slash Zen space
this is gonna be like my creative space
my workplace but also kind of where I do
yoga because there's going to be a big
opening now for me to kind of put up
yoga stuff the other room is going to be
my closets last bedroom I'm gonna have
to get very creative with that room
because there is such it's such a small
space but I think I've just kind of
accepted that having a city apartment
it's always a little tight with
furniture so we're just going to work
with it so I've right now basically if
everything goes according to plan
because these are not proper
measurements but I've written out where
I think I want all the furniture to be
so all that's really left to do now is
to you know throw out some tunes and
start moving furniture the goal of the
night is to get all the furniture
rearranged let's get this party started
you hover on the edge everything
I should try to keep track you're so
close
I can't find my way back
on the horizon and out of reach you want
me to wait back here on the beach you
wanna stay together and be free
try to keep check so Shh what's up guys
it is now day two in the for day 2 part
spring cleaning series I never stand up
so late let's say I pretty much was
reorganizing setting everything out and
I didn't film too much of it because the
lighting was really dark but that said
I'm so so so happy with how this is
turned out I've been kinda itching to
move I've been wanting to like start
looking at buying new condos I'm like
there's another vlog coming up soon that
I'm gonna go try different areas of
Toronto and tax season coming up and
there's some other things like COEs that
I'm putting some money towards and
catcher that I'm putting some money
towards and so I just want to make sure
that I'm like a hundred percent as
impulsive as I usually am I'm trying to
be very adult about this decision
because I feel like it's one you got to
do right so redoing my apartment and
just like spring cleaning it's making
the whole thing feel so new again which
might give me just like a few more
months of stability here and ease that
little itch to get out of here so
today's day to all of them moving around
of furniture is pretty much done and I
feel like that's always the first step
because you want to revamp the energy in
your space and I feel like the best way
to revamp the energy in your space is to
move things around and gain new function
of I believe that everything has energy
and that even the things that we think
our thoughts and our perspectives our
energy and so when you walk into a room
you kind of perceive the way things are
there's like a vibe that comes from that
so I've Fung Shui everything and I'm
very happy with the changes of all the
furniture and now today I'm gonna be
mainly focusing on decluttering
reorganizing the biggest thing that I
did last night that was a huge help was
taking everything out of its place and
putting it in a central area so the
central area for me is my living room
really quick before we do that though I
am going head for brunch I feel like
it's always important to to take a
little break in the middle of your like
disaster tornado of changing up your
entire place or space and so now that
Bentley has been shred and walked and
I've had a coffee and we're at a bit of
my book
I'm gonna continue putting all of this
on pause go for brunch and then come
back you know refresh
maybe go get a mimosa and get things
cracking lock with better word
oh so I've switched into my just sweater
I have taken all of the clutter out of
the main areas in both rooms and put it
in a central area a kay here and as you
can see there's a lot to go through I
have parcels that I need to open I have
stuff that I either need to donate and
get rid of or find a new way to organize
it and replace it have a lot of
decluttering and stuff ahead of me but
luckily I have the sectioned off all of
the rest of today to basically do it
hence why I needed this just sweater I'm
waiting for my mugs I've just through
load on in the dishwasher like I've
started already waiting for the months
to clean so I can brew myself another
cup of juice juice diving into this pile
let me show you like so many things did
that look at that hot mess I get anxiety
just looking at that
diving in my car just chasing pavements
died here with you cuz lonely nights and
drunken fights just don't read us off
like they used to
don't make me dinner
to try
I find like I said putting everything in
a central location makes it so that when
you go to pick it up you either have to
put it away or be away with it if you
can't find a place to put it you have to
ask yourself if you really need it and
if the answer is no then donate it or
get rid of it somehow recycle it
whatever you have to do okay I got rid
of my second desk and my second computer
chairs one thing at a time that way one
things don't seem so daunting because
there is still a lot to organize but
also to if you just take things one
thing at a time gives you the ability to
really ask like is this something that I
actually need things that I would
normally hold on to for no reasons for
that just in case detached from that and
thought if this doesn't serve a purpose
in my life now then I don't need it
decrease the amount of things that I
have attachments to to minimalize the
stress in my life and makes for
organizing and keeping things clean and
tidy easier because the more stuff you
have the more place you need to put
things and after winter I tend to like
hoard a lot of things especially after
Christmas and the holidays and my
birthday so it's just a good time to
kind of go through everything to be
honest with myself if I'm actually gonna
use it if I actually need it simplifying
tell me that you cheated that you messed
up
so quiet the Start screen
okay mission halfway accomplished now
that part one of the spring cleaning
/ redecorating is done I'm going to give
you guys a mini updated apartment tour
to top off this vlog this is the new
view when you walk in the door I have
officially made this little shoe shelf
which was so needed this normally won't
be there that's just recycling and a
gift that I have I have just like my
main shoes like I used those to go
downstairs or like take out recycling my
running shoes my favorite pair of black
booties right now and then rollerblades
because Yolo I have my hot yoga mat and
behind that I just have my umbrella and
then on top I just put this plant a
vintage camera this plate which has a
bowl as my keys in it and my sunglasses
and then hers that I got in Paris last
year it's vegan and we kept the skulls
because they're just they're epic not a
whole lot changed in the kitchen but I
did put this here now this might be
subject to change but that is there and
then I am collecting dried up flowers
for the DIY and part 2 of this video so
that's the beginning of the collection
now this area is completely open which I
feel like gives so much more space to my
living room I put my fresh new flowers
one of them here along with this little
elephant guy I got him in Dominican and
he's supposed to bring your home good
luck and the little hand palm thing on
the other side of the couch I just put
the fireplace this up here is changing
that's one of the DIYs I'm going to be
doing is a piece of wall art that's
gonna go there on the actual fireplace
itself I just have another vintage
camera some of the books that I want to
read over the next little bit and then
more candles plants and flowers and then
looking backseat look how I just can't
get over that front area it just looks
so much better now this room which used
to be my bedroom is back to being my
office so when you walk in I just have
my guitar and then I put these
bookshelves kind of like the ones at the
front just some of my favorite things
and also stuff that I kind of wanted to
be in the background of video since this
is gonna be where I film now I still
kept the string lights up and then as
for my office space it stayed pretty
much the same I just transported it into
here the only difference is is I
reorganized like all of my
drawers again and when I was putting it
all back in I made sure to like put it
back in like one thing at a time to keep
it all organized and then on my desk I
just have the OG COEs coffee talk mug
with my pens in it another vintage
camera my feather from Diagon Alley in
Universal and then on this side I just
have some little cacti the features in
the palm of your hand and then this lamp
that was beside my bed before and then
this area is the part that's still kind
of a work in progress this is what I'm
gonna focus on for part two I basically
want to fill this mantle with plants
kind of keep like a little yoga section
right over here but for now I just have
the plants that I do have my infuser
some crystals more of those flowers that
I picked up I have this little Buddha my
yoga mat and then I have more plants on
this side house add my bonsai tree is
you guys know how to bring this guy back
to life please tell me because I've
tried everything right here I just have
this is a box of makeup that I need to
go through and this is just extra Co
sweaters that I need to send out and
then me so that's basically the biggest
changes in this room and then I'll show
you guys it's my bedroom now so this
room turned out so much better than I
thought I put that first tool that used
to be at the front here and I just have
my Google Play on top of it I put up the
three pieces of wall art from society6
and the other thing I love about it is
that the Sun actually comes through this
room a lot so it's nice in the morning
time and then over here I kept my closet
section there but I actually put my TV
inside and then plugged it in down there
so when you're lying Abed can watch TV
this actually I don't know why I love
this so much but it's just so cozy to me
hello and my breakfast tray so that when
I'm having coffee and reading and here
in the morning which I've been doing the
last two days since I've rearranged this
place amazing and then just on this side
this is usually not here I just put that
there because Bentley wanted to sunbathe
usually goes there so that has been put
there have my little fur rug and then I
have a little secret going on underneath
the bed more shoes because I couldn't
get rid of them we've got our good vibes
only light which actually makes this
room look so cool at nighttime and then
this patio is like another huge thing
I'm gonna completely redo for part two
so stay tuned
for that I'll give you a nice before
it's completely empty there's still a
lot of things that are gonna change and
that's all coming in part two but I want
to show you guys basically where we're
at so far and also if you guys decide
from this video just spring clean and
like spruce up your space send me some
pictures because I want to see what you
guys come up with the thing about
changing up your furniture and changing
up your apartment or changing up your
bedroom whatever you're doing kinda have
to get creative with the space you have
and creative with the things you have
and that was kind of the whole premise
of part one of spring cleaning is
getting creative with what we have and
getting rid of what we don't need
anymore I'm like absolutely obsessed
with this layouts I know welcome to the
new filming setup this is just oh I'm so
excited I love that this workspace is
now in here because it's so much lighter
and brighter I felt like I was so
hibernated with my office in the other
room and I've decided that for spring
and summer
I wanted to switch it up and make sleep
my hibernation and make work my Sun
filled window filled office room and now
to finish it all off I'm going to sit
down and basically plan out what I need
to do to finish off my spring clean it's
time to get into the deep cleaning and
the redecorating which is so much fun
guys I'm about to Pinterest I'm about to
plant first things first chill buddy
chill okay this is where things get fun
if you have a little bit of money to put
away towards like redecorating and even
if you don't there's gonna be some
really cool and like relatively cheap
DIY so I'm gonna be doing in the second
part of this series I don't want to give
away what they are but they're dope
there are two main areas that I want to
completely redo first one this room so
my office space is also my like yoga
slash life style space a couple weeks
ago I would have been like that's a
class you can't have your relaxing yoga
space in the same space that you do work
I feel like I've found a yin and yang
inside of myself lately and I like the
idea that if I can coexist like
relaxation and yoga with creativity and
my work simpatico in this room and I
feel like work will be less stressful
and yoga I'll take more seriously we are
the mantle along the window I want to
fill it with plants
I decided 24 will be the year that I
learned the green thumb I'm literally
just gonna write pants dance yes
need some in SPO whoo I love that okay
it's the other thing I want to do I'm
gonna get like a little basket Crystal's
if I run into them I like crystals to
come to me and then last but not least
is do I want to change this because if I
if I find the better chicken wire maybe
I'll change and then the last thing or
the second thing that I want to
completely redo is the patio that leads
to my now bedroom feel like it's a smart
thing to do to kind of just pick one or
two main areas that you really want to
focus on that way one you're not
spending too much money
and two you can actually feel like if
you put your full attention and focus
there you can take an old space and make
it feel completely new we need to get
creative
it's a decently small patio the biggest
thing that I want are the chairs to be
comfy I know I definitely want to find a
way to string up some lights and I wanna
be furniture I'm gonna plant an herb
garden house a lot lots of flowers oh my
god some of these are insane candles I
didn't even think about it I am so
excited yes all right
I'm feeling I'm feeling the vibes so
this concludes this apartment spring
cleaning slash updated work and also a
little plan with me for redecorating up
my space for spring I'm so excited

magic so I hope you guys enjoyed today's
