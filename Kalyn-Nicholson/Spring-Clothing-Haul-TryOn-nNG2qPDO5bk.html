to be doing a spring haul and this was
actually requested I did do a haul
recently but there are some newer things
again that I have because of videos
coming up and blog posts coming up and
because it's spring and you guys know I
have a shopping problem so basically I'm
going to be showing you guys now just
more spring related things that I've
recently purchased also I'd like to
apologize for my wet hair I just
showered and I try not to use heat on my
hair when I can so I decided but I
didn't care and I was gonna film this
video anyways with wet hair okay so I'm
just gonna jump right in and I'm gonna
try to try on as many things as possible
so when I do you will see a little clip
pop up right here of me wearing the item
so I'm not gonna try absolutely
everything on but I will show you guys a
lot of this stuff I'm going to start
with a show post so these are the things
that I basically recently got from show
PO one of the things I'm not gonna be
able to show you guys because I wore it
and it's in the wash now and that is
basically just the top I was wearing in
my coffee with Kaelyn video and in my
latest selfie so that was also from show
PO and I'll keep the link to it down
below but I'm going to show you
everything else that I got but basically
these are the pants that I got now they
kind of are showing up a little bit
funny on camera but they're supposed to
look a little bit like not fully like
fake leather or faux leather but they
are like shiny and there are very
different material I don't know I just
find they look very kind of edgy when
you wear them and they're nice and
stretchy in the leg and super
comfortable to wear when I went through
my birthday dinner with Ryan we went
somewhere a little bit fancy so I wore
these with like little wedged booties
and a cute top and a scarf and it was
really cute so these are the pants that
I picked up next I got this pair of
shorts and I love the fit of these so
they're nice and tight around your waist
and they just zip up right in the center
but I love how much they flare out if
you guys can see that
they definitely flare out at the hips
and I find it gives you more of like
that little hourglass figure or the
illusion of kind of having more
voluptuous hips so
I'm not someone that has very fill into
his hips so I'm glad to get these
because I find they give my body more
kind of curve appeal the next thing I
purchased is probably one of my favorite
things that I officially own in my
closet and it is one of these casual you
guys know how I like my graphic cheese
or like my tees with stuff written on
them so it says it's sleep blog repeat
and that is pretty much my life I eat
sleep blog slash YouTube and repeat so
um I just absolutely love this and I
love the like I just love that it's so
big and cozy and comfy and then in the
bottom and pink it says hashtag I love
show PO next is this cropped white
knitted sweater and this is just gonna
be really cute for throwing on even over
like your bathing suit in the summertime
or just for snowing on on top of a
little bra let and some something
high-waisted it's very versatile and
really cute and cozy so that's a little
sweater and then last but absolutely not
least is this two-piece and I'm obsessed
with it this is probably my favorite
thing out of this entire haul so these
are the shorts and again they flare out
making them look nice and cute and
they're just so adorable and then they
have this crochet detailing around the
bottom and then the top is just like a
little bra let it's a halter top so it
ties around the top like this and then
around your back obviously and it is so
flattering and so cute and it's gonna
look so nice with a tan in the summer
and even in the spring once it starts to
get warmer in the spring so next I'm
moving into Shug Allah Troost and I've
got the box here so I'll show you guys
everything I got from there um this is
kind of like on the topic of bra let's I
got and this will be nice and cute and
it's cropped and it's nice just to put
again under something bag here or once
it starts to get warmer out you could
wear this with high-waisted jeans and
such or high-waisted shorts so there's a
lot of things you could do with
something like this but this is the
little knitted bra let top that I got
next I got this skirt and I have a blog
post and mine for this one it's a little
bit different than something I'm used to
wearing but that's why I think I like it
so much and it screams the spring so
this is the skirt that I got it's
actually
a miniskirt and it just reminds me of
like the 50s and 60s when people would
wear skirts that kind of like poof it a
little bit but only go to their knee so
it's white and hot pink and the material
is nice and stretchy and super comfy and
I have a really cute spring outfit in
mind for this skirt next is this top and
I love the print of this it's kind of
like a paisley print and again it's
another halter so you tie it around your
neck and it flares out a lot around the
hips which again I find gives more of an
hourglass figure which I obviously
really like and my favorite part is the
back the back literally only has just
like this little thing it's like a
stretchy strap that's holding everything
together and next thing I got is a dress
and I've thought I've been looking I
looked at this chest before I chose last
time and I didn't pick it up and then
when I went back on I was like hey I
just need to get it because it's so
pretty
so it's this dress here it's just white
and black and the material it's not like
quilted but it does have a bit of a
texture to it and then it zips down the
back of course and then right around the
waist is the skirt part or the bottom
part of this dress it's kind of like the
envelope style so I just think that this
is so flattering and I love skirts and
dresses that have material that kind of
goes lower on one side because I find it
it's just really really flattering for
your legs next I picked up just one of a
staple pieces and it's one of the high
neck kind of crop tops but in white I
have a couple of these with some designs
and some of them without designs but in
black but I don't have one of white a
lot of the things I've been trying to
style lately I've needed a white ones so
I picked this up and I think it was only
like $6.99 so it's nice and cheap and
then next I have another two-piece to
show you guys and this one is so cute so
this is what it looks like here it is
white with black palm trees all over it
and that is the skirt it's just a basic
skater skirt and then the top is another
one of the high neck tops or high neck
cropped tops
and this is what it looks like here so
obviously you could wear it as a
two-piece or you could wear it
separately with different items on the
top or bottom as for shoes the first
pair of shoes that I picked up is to go
with a certain outfit for a blog post
and they are these
pink heels get rid of the bad stuff so
they're just these little pink heels and
these are gonna be really really cute I
think for kind of more fancier things
going on this spring and summer it's
always good to have like a bright shoe I
just find you could wear like all black
and have it's just a super super bright
shoe and it just I just ride it look so
good
I just love the look of it and
especially with like a nice tan and I
love this like magenta colors and then I
also picked up a little pair of booties
as well and the booties that I ended up
picking up are gonna be so cute for the
spring these are with the little booties
that I picked up look like and I find
these are so cute for spring and I don't
I have one other pair of tan booties but
I like that this had like the chocolate
brown or the like warm medium brown faux
leather detailing on belt buckles on it
and then the next thing I got from
Charlotte Russe is this jumpsuit here so
I know kind of it's hard for you guys to
see what it looks like and it looks
really um out there or crazy on camera
but I have a specific way mine of
styling this so this is the romper I
picked up and it is in like a chiffon
type material my one of my favorite
parts about it are the arm slits and I
just think that that's really pretty and
then it kind of just like ties off in
the front and then it just has the open
kind of relaxed short seeing next little
pair of booties I got again I've been
seeing this style everywhere - are these
black ones and you may have seen these
in an Instagram post so these little
black booties they are just like faux
leather I got them Charlotte Russe and
then I have the belt the belt buckle and
then my favorite part is that they have
the cutout heel so when you're wearing
them you can see the back of your foot
I've been seeing that sound a lot lately
and I just think it's so cute and these
are so versatile and there's so many
outfits you can wear them with and I
just love like the edginess and the
cuteness of them and of course you guys
know already by now how I like my high
net crop tops so I picked one up in
stripes as well because again they're
just super cheap and they're so
versatile and really easy to pair with
cute bottoms for the spring and summer
so I picked up a striped one as well and
then the next two piece I got was also
from Charlotte Russe and
a floral 2p so this is the top here and
it's just got such pretty pretty colors
in it it screams Springs so this is the
top part to it and then the bottom again
is another more of like a midi skirt
it's not it's not very short and it has
the envelope detailing on the bottom too
I don't know if you guys can tell that
but it does have the envelope style
bottom and then the last thing I have to
show you guys from Charlotte Russe I
promise are these shoes here and these I
got for the outfit with this two-piece
they're just another pair of bright
heels because I mean a girl can never
have too many high-heeled shoes well
depends on who you're asking but these
are the second pair and I just love how
it like folds over in the front and has
the zipper and then the little peep toe
and these are so easy to walk in because
they completely cover the top of your
foot I find them so comfortable and easy
even though they have like this diletto
heel so they last place that I'm going
to be showing you guys some stuff by is
surprise surprise forever21 you guys
know I like to keep it like cheaper when
I'm shopping so that it's affordable for
all of you guys and miss because I find
it easier to follow the trends when
you're spending less money on them so
let's move into forever 21 the first
thing I have to show you guys which you
guys already know how obsessed I was
with the first one I picked up so I
ended up grabbing it in another color
and it is the plaid dress so if you guys
have been watching my videos or my blog
post you'll know that I already posted
an outfit with a plaid dress in it and
it was just it's just so easy to throw
on and it looks like you tried super
hard on your outfit but you really
didn't so this one is really cute it's
got the brown belt again and this one is
in more of like a red and navy blue
color so this one's obviously a lot
different coloring than the first one
and it's been my go-to lately to throw
on when I don't know what to wear
next I ended up picking up a spring
jacket because I realized that I don't
actually have one other than I have a
great one but it's kind of ripped so
this is just like a trenchcoat style
jacket from forever 21 but it's nice and
thin and it's black and I just find
blackberry burst I almost got it in tan
or taupe but I was just afraid that I
wouldn't be able to style it with a lot
of things whereas black of course is
such an easy color to go with and I
always end up buying everything in black
and then the one thing I end up liking
about this is that it's actually got a
little bit of padding in the shoulders
so it gives you more of like that high
fashioned type of luck without having
too crazy of shoulders next it was
relatively cheap and I wanted to have
one just as a good staple piece but I
ended up picking up just a black pencil
skirt like a MIDI one that goes down to
your knees and then last but not least I
have two bags to show you guys from
forever 21 because I have a recently
acquired a bag problem I just like
having lots of options of bags to match
with your outfit so this is the bag that
I picked up it's in taupe and black so
it looks like this it's got the faux
black leather on the bottom and then the
rest is a more matte taupe and then it's
got black outlining on the straps and
around the top last but not least I know
I have this bag in taupe already but I
had to get it in white because I was so
obsessed with it I actually have an
issue I had a little bit of extra money
to spend this month and I really wanted
to get into doing a lot of really fun
videos for you guys for spring and a
little really fun blog posts so that's
why I kind of went all out this year but
I picked it up in white because I got it
in taupe and I was so obsessed that I've
been using it as my go-to so I really
wanted to have it in another color for
different outfits so I ended up picking
up in white as well since I already have
one that's very similar in black and
then also from forever 21 I picked up
this hat that I have in mind for a blog
post as well so it's just one of the
wide brimmed hats and I got it in gray
since I don't obviously have one in gray
so this is the Hat that I picked up from
forever 21 so that is everything I have
to show you guys for this spring haul I
hope you guys enjoy I'm super super
excited to style all these things for
you guys thumbs up if you guys like
hauls because I definitely like filming
holes because I personally love watching
other people's homes it's just cool to
see what other people about what other
people are buying and what styles
they're loving so yeah so I hope you
guys enjoyed this haul and it inspired
you for some things you might be looking
for this spring season and other than
that I will see you guys all in a future
