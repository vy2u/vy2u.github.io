two of my spring bleeding series if you
guys haven't seen part one I will pop it
up on the screen or post it down below
but basically I decided to do a little
two part series in spring cleaning
because one my apartment was in some
desperate need of it and two I was just
feeling inspired to kind of spruce up my
place
so if today being part two it's all
about redecorating DIYs and cleaning so
travel mug take a seat
this is gonna be I'm really saying this
is gonna be a fun video if you guys
aren't following me already I was
posting little peeks and hints at all of
the decor and stuff that I did for this
video on my Instagram I'll profit on the
screen and I also posted a blog post on
Friday that is a spring cleaning
checklist and a bucket list for spring I
also included two playlists and the
books I want to read this spring so
definitely check out my blog too I'll
put it down below if you guys didn't
already my two main projects for this
like redecorating revamping video was
one this room I wanted to do the mantle
and kind of create more of a Zen /eo
this Basin years since the office space
is pretty much done as you guys can see
so I really wanted to like get a bunch
of plants get a little like yoga basket
stuff like that the second project was
the bigger one and it is my patio that
leads off of my bedroom I really wanted
to create a space that I can sit outside
I can read my book I can drink my coffee
in the morning once it starts getting a
little nicer out so those are the
projects that I was focusing on along
with I need to just stand ahead some
DIYs that I wanted to do for the
springtime since I feel like spring is
such a fun time to get crafty Schlemmer
and overalls I feel like these are also
very spring first
first there were a couple DIYs that I
wanted to do from planters to dream
catchers to driftwood you guys want to
get paint all over your hands and do
some fun spring DIYs with me then let's
just you know
all my carpet in my basement silence
spin the roof like a cigarettes and make
a baked on that bus high like they used
to
so make me peace
try to make things right
to work
you just tell me and you cheated that
you messed up cuz I need
I went to quiet let's start screaming
just say
driving in my car just chasing pavements
static here with you cuz lonely nights
and drunken fights just don't read us
off like they used to make me
try
okay
use your survey
and you cheated then you messed up
because I needed
- quiet let's start screaming
just say tell me
messed up
I saw it straight
just said
those
now those the DIYs are done there's a
lot of stuff in my living room right now
because of all the patio stuff that I
bought let me give you guys a little
look bags and planting stuff and just
just basically things everywhere in a
ladder so I'm just gonna you know pull
up this patio chair and share with you
guys a quick little mini haul I'm not
gonna show you guys everything I thought
but I want to show you guys some of the
favorite things that I got for my patio
first of all how like this pillow I
already had two pillows for my patio but
then I saw this one today and I just I
couldn't put it down I'm gonna try and
fit two pillows on one of these chairs
everything I'm showing you guys right
now is from home since I got this little
Buddha for my outdoor patio slash it's
gonna be like a garden up there -
there's gonna be a wack ton of plants
I bought fake plants to show you guys
kind of the before and after of what my
patio is gonna look like but it's still
a little early to actually be planting
things out there considering its snowed
like two days ago but once it starts
getting nice you're out I'm gonna put so
many plants I want to plant a garden I
want to plant herbs and vegetables so
happy and then in the midst of leaves
and plants and things I also because
I've been cooking and baking lately I
saw this at home sense and didn't even
realize I needed it so I bought it it's
this little thing that says spoon you
put your spoon on there as I'm sure you
know but it keeps your like counter from
getting dirty also got a new French
press so the French press I've been
using I got it from indigo a while ago
and it was actually I was using it for
decor and I love it but it's really
really small and since I've been
traveling a little bit I have some
travel coming up I've been really
enjoying bringing my French press with
me to make like my coffee wherever I go
do I wanted to pick up a new one that
was a bit bigger so I can make bigger
cups of coffee because I don't I don't
play around when it comes to drinking
coffee and I liked it cuz it was like
white I found this candle and it looks
like it's in like a crepe barrel and it
says Chardonnay it smells so good so I
think I'm gonna put this in my office
slash yoga space even though like
Chardonnay isn't very zen actually
Chardonnay is so Zen whoo
coming from the green grape variety
created from the influence of terrier
and oak
speaking of wine this is another thing I
found and I didn't realize I needed it
until I saw it I actually cracked open a
bottle of wine last night and then
realized that I didn't have anything to
cork it with afterwards and then saw
this today and it was on sale not to
mention it's an amethyst which is my
birthstone and it's just a sort of like
wine stopper to the other candle I got
is this one here and it's ambered musk
and again it smells like it just smells
so oaky smells so good so I'm gonna put
that one in and it kind of goes nicely
with this one so I'm gonna put these on
the mantle with all my plants in my
office slash to yoga room then since
I've been using literally like a pot
that you bake past in I don't have
anything to boil water
so I finally picked up a kettle I wanted
to try and find a kettle like in my
staycation vlogs had a lot one of the
Airbnb s was baby pink and it was so
cute and I looked everywhere and I could
not find one so I picked this one up but
my elephant also got this guy it how
cute heels I'm hoping that putting this
out is going to help the law of
attraction of me you know going to
Thailand and petting an elephant like
we've already talked about because I
just I love elephants they're so cute I
just thought he would look cute amongst
all the plants this was also on sale and
I got it for outside I'm gonna put this
it's like a marble or like a cement slab
with court my table outside for like
drinking coffee and things like that I'm
also going to put a plant in the middle
two more things that are kind of cool
that I want to show you guys so this I
found at the dollar store and it's the
cutest thing ever and it's making me so
excited to start gardening host plant
tools that I picked up from the dollar
store epic fun and then these I'm really
excited about these are one of the two
types of string lights and I'm going to
be putting out on my patio I found these
at Michaels they're little mini mason
jars string lights and I just think
those are gonna look so cute out on the
patio and create such a size the bottom
kind of going for outside is like really
cute and like spring and summer ish but
also a little bit a little bit rustic I
got this - it's silver and it's supposed
to look like like like the trunk of a
tree so it's kind of like a mixture of
girly
you modern butt was a bit of restiveness
you feel I don't know what vibe I'm kind
of going for but it's creating itself so
now with that said give you guys a quick
before shot of what my patio look like
and then speed up the process do some
cool be role throwing some music
decorate the path
maybe 10 years you'll call me on the
telephone wonder if I'm all remember how
we knew each other in 10 years
everyone's way down the line and we fall
into the fire I know I know your number
I used to love you like the world there
here's to love you like a child thing
about people's they change
when they walk away
then you stop real slow
things no one knows I hate to be bring
flowers draught and glass the final hour
and life rose it's all so fast just
slows we cried that night
Carver realized we let go
I used to love you like the world used
to love you like child
thing about people's a chair
walk away
so it's actually Sunday I have just been
editing a video for most of the day
uploaded it and then I'm just started
making my carrot cake I finished off the
rest of my mantle this morning I headed
to the store to pick up two new plants I
got Bo and Billie oh I'll show you guys
in the final tour of all the update and
then I just put a carrot cake in the
oven I'm so excited I don't know why but
I'm just a like Fenian carrot cake I
think it's because it's spring and
spring makes me think of bunnies and
bunnies make me think of carrots and
carrot cake goes good dunked and coffee
and so all of that just made so much
sense to me I've been putting the recipe
to the carrot cake on my blog on Friday
so definitely check that out if you guys
want to make it it's a vegan carrot cake
with a buttercream icing I will give you
guys some b-roll and updates when it's
done as for the rest of this afternoon
it's going on 5 p.m. because it is a
Sunday and it's a just day I'm gonna
order myself in some takeout I'm going
to do a quick hose conference call with
my sister and then I'm gonna clean my
apartment and pack up again because
they're doing more construction of my
apartment this week this is actually the
tear up portion of my apartment so
unfortunately all of the spring cleaning
and spring decorating I just did I'm not
gonna be able to fully enjoy it until
the end of this week there my apartment
from Monday to Friday I'm packing up and
heading to my hometown for a few days
because I have to pull everything out of
all the cupboards and drawers I'm gonna
finish with like organizing and labeling
everything if you guys want a video on
that I mean it's kind of lame but let me
know and I can I can make this a three
part series but as for the decorations
I'm now gonna give you guys a final like
look / tour of my garden make my indoors
and spaced garden and my patio let's do
it this is what my mantle / Zen space
looks like after it's definitely not
finished yet but I feel like we got a
very good start on the plant collection
starting off the little mantel tour I
just have this this is from HomeSense
it's meant for I think like baked goods
and stuff like that and then on top I
just put my crystals and then this
cactus planter is from HomeSense and
inside I have my he's from he's from the
rainforest just says tropicals but this
is my my one plant he doesn't have a
name yet and then I just have some fresh
flowers I have two candles
two more crystals I picked this up from
the rock store in Toronto and then I
picked this up at happy soul I have my
Buddha my new DIY planter I'm obsessed
with how this turned out I think it's so
cute and so spring this guy I got today
this is Bo and he's just like in this
little china mug I love succulents I've
come to the conclusion that I feel very
drawn to the succulents in terms of
plants and then this is just a little
glass cactus I got from chapters and
then all the flowers inside of that are
fake and this is where I ended up
putting at the Chardonnay candle this is
Billie is so Billie and Bo are brothers
I got them together this candle I ended
up putting here the amber musk we've got
Ollie the elephant just chillin telling
us to come to Thailand I have my orchid
which I just put ice cubes in so I'm
trying to regrow it this cilantro kit
I'm gonna start it after I get back
since I'm gone all week I want to make
sure I'm here to tend to my little
cilantro plant and then I think
eventually I might pop him in my mini
garden with another herb but for now in
my mini garden I just have these two
little plants my rose bush and then this
is a Romeo Romeo plant again don't
really know what I want to name these if
you like this one I will kind of want to
name it indigo or Nova and then this one
I don't know yeah I can't think of
anything creative right now so if you
guys could name think of a name for the
little mini rosebush pop it down below
then I have these succulents that I got
from benefit for my birthday and then
this guy here and then damn I really sad
Tiki this is Tiki the bonsai tree and
we're trying to revive him back to life
but it's a work of progress then I just
have my incense my diffuser and then the
basket that I ended up picking up for
all my yoga stuff I have my yoga mat mat
yoga blanket and the yoga strap that I
use and I also have my massage balls in
here somewhere so that's like a final
look at what happened in this room and
I'm so happy with how it turned out like
especially when I pull out my yoga mat
and do yoga and stuff tonight I'm gonna
take some string lights and string them
all through here but that's what we've
got so far
and then in terms of showing you guys
patio also I'll show you guys blah just
like after shots in here too this is
where I ended up putting that DIY which
again I love but I'm also debating
hanging it from a roof hook right here
undecided we have a very Sunday Bentley
and I have all of my like hanging plants
now don't like my cupboards I'm in the
middle of baking I love to look at this
from all angles in this apartment it's
just it's so cute Inc this may have
turned out my favorite out of everything
I can't wait for it to be warm enough to
go out and just like hang out there at
nighttime if I have friends over I can
have a glass of wine out there I can
read my book out there in the mornings
of coffee it's just gonna be it's gonna
be such a cute little Zen spot I'm
definitely not done with my patio I want
to put a bunch more plants especially in
the front area like when you first look
out again I feel like this is such a
good start considering how much time and
how cold it kind of still is out and
come May when it's a good time to start
planting seeds and stuff this is where I
want to put like a little vegetable
garden and all of that but for now this
is the current situation we have going
on in the patio so I'm now going to
finish off the carrot cake piece it
together and take the last bit of photos
for it for my blog FaceTime my sister
and I'm going to clean this apartment
pack up and get ready to leave tomorrow
so I definitely have some Justine to do
tonight I have a lot of laundry to do I
have to string the lights in here and I
have to clear out all of the cupboards
so that they can get into the piping
system so I'm having a wild Sunday aside
from that I hope you guys enjoyed part
two the DIY / tree decorating portion of
the spring cleaning
series if you guys want me to film and
record the part three where I pull
everything out of coverage label
everything of cupboards and my closets
and stuff like that then just let me
know down below I'm just not sure if
like the spring cleaning redoing
reorganizing thing is getting a little
old for you guys now so I feel like a
lot of my videos have been based around
that but if you want it
other than that thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you guys all
