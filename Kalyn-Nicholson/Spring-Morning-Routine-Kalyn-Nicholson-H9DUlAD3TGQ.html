routine it's been a while since I've
done one of these but I figured I would
do an updated version system so highly
requested lately I've been trying to get
up at about 6 a.m. but sometimes I do
sleep in mind you but the days that I do
get up at 6 I get up make myself a
coffee let Bentley out and do all the
little things I'm used to basically
before I go for and
so for those of you guys that follow my
snapchat you may already know this but I
recently switched my bedroom over into
the second bedroom that's in my
apartment so I'm really enjoying it in
the sense of it's a lot more daylight
and I like the view and I just wanted to
change things up you know
also to all of my fellow coffee
connoisseurs I highly recommend picking
up this soaked coffee creamer is in the
hazelnut flavor I've been using it
recently and it's on so addicting you
have no idea which your coffee tastes
like heaven and then while I drink my
coffee I've been trying to do this thing
where I answer emails just stay on top
of everything and I also check my
planner I've been using my google
planner again I can do a plan with new
video soon with you guys but you add
check my calendar answer emails and then
I get ready to take Bentley for a quick
little walk and then I head to the gym
I feel like I'm ready I said I can make
it better than any long is too long for
any rate as my reason I stayed I thought
we were on a very biological and
something I've been trying to do lately
just to stay a little bit healthier than
usual is taking the stairs instead of
the elevator and then after that I'll
either hit the gym or I'll run outside
it really depends on the weather if it's
raining out I will hit the gym or if I'm
doing strength training all hydrogen but
if it's nicer out or if it's like warm I
will usually run outside and like run
around you know the buildings and towers
unsure on
and then I'll usually start my like skin
routine so lately it like you guys know
from watching my last vlog I'm doing
like a bit of a trial with the biotherm
like plankton and then so I washed my
face with that after my shower and then
I just moisturized and after that I will
brush my teeth I know it's weird too
wasteful on the brush my teeth but I
mean over 20 tonight so it doesn't just
pop me in the morning but sometimes I'll
brush them before I run I don't know
what I do feel the same way to the crazy
laughing you are so depending on how
hungry I am this is usually when I'll
make breakfast I without a doubt make a
smoothie most mornings so I like Sato
pika
protein powder I have the chocolate one
and then I use the maca powder too which
is supposed to stabilize your hormones
and let me tell you it works as I had a
banana some water and some strawberries
whatever I'm feeling like throwing in my
smoothie sometimes all spinach and such
and if I'm extra hungry or if I actually
have the groceries for it sometimes I'll
make myself some oatmeal or some cereal
or fruit full on the side but I needed
to get groceries today so I didn't do
that and then take me through the into
my room and usually work on my laptop
for a bit and hang out with Bentley
before I get ready
me
me
so that concludes my most recent updated
morning routine I hope you guys enjoyed
