after I'm finished work that day or
lately I have been going out and hanging
out with friends on patios and stuff
just because the weather has been nice
so I'll normally come home kick off my
shoes and hang out with Bentley for a
little bit because even if I'm only gone
for like 30 minutes he goes crazy
whenever I come home so I like to hang
out with him a bit and take him outside
so he can go to the washroom and all
that fun stuff and I've been super
addicted to going to the gym and working
out again
so I will usually turn on my Spotify
which I'm obsessed with because I can
play it on my computer from my phone and
I have a summer sixteen like body summer
16 playlist and I'm obsessive and so I
just usually throw that on my computer
to kind of get me pumped up to go to the
gym and then as that's playing I'll turn
it up nice and loud just not loud enough
that I get complaints and then I'll go
into like my Beauty room closet room
whatever you want to call this and I'll
get my workout gear on and I'll usually
start heading for the gym and grab my
headphones and some water and sometimes
I'll hit to the gym other times I'll
work out outside normally it wasn't as
late as it was when I was filming this
but it's really all what I'm feeling
that day
so then normally after my workout I will
kick off my shoes finish off whatever is
left in my water bottle and then fill it
up and put it back in the fridge so that
it is ready to go for dinner and then
grab a towel and of course you know
shower because I'm normally all sweaty
and gross because I actually sweat
disgusting amounts like more than the
average you know female should but yeah
feeling in the space it's me you gotta
kill yourself
and something I've been obsessed with
lately that Maggie showed me is these
little like waterproof cell phone cases
that we got off Amazon so I got one for
my new apartment I usually put my phone
in there and I do not shower without it
because I don't know it's just so much
more fun to shower when you got music
going so normally at this point I'll
play some country music and take way too
long of a shower because I'm normally
jamming out and then I will throw with
my clothes in the dirty hamper and then
throw on some pajamas
so by this point I'm normally pretty
hungry and I don't normally like to eat
before I go to the gym or workout
because I get really bad cramps when I'm
doing cardio so I decided to make myself
some pad thai this night but whenever I
am making dinner I make a super large
amount so that I can kind of meal prep
for two days following the day that I
cook so I decided to make this like
really easy Pad Thai I just boiled some
vermicelli rice noodles and then I
cooked up some tofu red peppers and
mushrooms and some green onions put some
pad thai sauce on it and yeah that was
pretty much it and some like fresh green
onion it was really really easy to make
and I'm going to be doing a video soon
of a bunch of really easy vegan dinners
and like how I kind of meal prep but I
also have a vlog coming showing a lot of
the foods that I eat as well but yeah so
that is why I cooked for dinner that
night and I made a bunch of extra and
put it in a Tupperware container in the
fridge for the following two days
so then I'll grab my water bottle in my
food and normally eat this in the living
room if I'm by myself if I have company
over sometimes I'll eat at the dining
room table but I'm not gonna lie I
normally eat with TV it's a really bad
habit but oh well I live alone so and
lately I've been obsessed with How I Met
Your Mother I'm watching it for like the
billing at the time so that is what I
threw on as a my pad thai I normally
kind of chill on my phone and stuff
because I've seen how I Met Your Mother
before so it's a good like background TV
show
bring to ourselves
and then maybe not every night but
normally I try to do some of the dishes
right away so that they're not sitting
overnight because if I wait till the
next day it drives me nuts to wake up to
it a dirty kitchen it's like a pet peeve
of mine so I will do some of the dishes
and leave them out to dry and then yeah
so at this point of the night it's kind
of a free-for-all sometimes I'll work on
my book like dreamcatcher sometimes I'll
edit videos if I'm behind or sometimes
I'll just kind of surf the Internet it
really doesn't like it's kind of
different every single night but I like
to hang out at the counter for this one
for some reason I don't know sometimes I
just like to prefer being on my macbook
as opposed my desktop computer so I'll
surf the Internet all that fun stuff
I'll make a tea and again I've been
still obsessed with peppermint tea for
like ever and ever which I'm sure you
guys aren't surprised so I'll make
myself like a peppermint tea and I've
also been like not even intentionally
but I've been trying to kick the habit
of TV that sounds weird but I haven't
been watching as much TV lately I've
been more into like kind of reading or
late at night I'll normally FaceTime
like Monique or Maggie and stay on
FaceTime for like hours and hours so
that has not only been like the routine
ever since I've moved into this
apartment I FaceTime people like every
single night it's kind of funny but yeah
so that's kind of what I do at this
point of the night
so once that's done and it normally
takes a few hours and again sometimes I
will watch some TV or play some Halo or
something I will blow out all my candles
and kind of put some things away and
then head to the bathroom to brush my
teeth and do all of the fun stuff that
you normally do before you go to bed
and then again right from here it kind
of differs depending on the night but
lately my obsession has been falling
asleep to my dawn golden record so I
will plug my phone in and no I don't put
my phone right beside my bed because
otherwise I wouldn't get up in the
morning and most nights I will put on my
record player and again I'm listening to
the Don Golden Record but sometimes I'll
also just watch TV or put on country
music again it kind of differs every
night and then that's pretty much it
I'll climb into bed flow throw off my
slippers and normally I will throw off
my sweater - and then cozy on up and
flick off the lights so I hope you guys
enjoyed my night routine and I will see
you guys all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
