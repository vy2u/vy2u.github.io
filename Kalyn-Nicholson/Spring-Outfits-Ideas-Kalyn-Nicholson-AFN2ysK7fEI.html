be sharing with you guys five different
spring outfit ideas and this first one
is inspired by like a spring party or an
event or a date night or anything like
that so I'm just wearing this really
cute romper from Lulu's and you can tie
the bandages all different ways you
could literally wear this dress a
billion different ways and then I paired
it with a leather jacket some black
booties and a little black satchel and
then this next outfit is inspired by a
spring date night or maybe you have like
a nice dinner to go to so I just paired
it this really cute baby pink umm maxi
skirt with a cropped cream-colored top
from Urban Outfitters and again with a
leather jacket a leather jackets always
like my go-to for almost every single
outfit and then I just paired it with
these cute black box
and of course you can't forget a girls
day or a shopping day so I got this
really cute black t-shirt style dress
from another planet paired it with this
Jean type button up and just some cute
flats and aviators this is such a cute
casual spring outfit that you could wear
pretty much anywhere and for the days
you're looking for something more
comfortable casual and you kind of want
to feel a little bit like a badass I
paired these ripped black jackings with
a plaid shirt and then I just thrown a
ball cap and some Nikes and honestly it
just he just feels so cool in this
outfit and it's super comfortable and
super casual
and we can't forget that Easter dress
but let's say Easter is over you could
wear this for church or maybe like a day
date but I just got this really cute
cotton candy dress from show PO paired
it with a long gray cardigan and some
gray fringe booties and I'm just this is
my favorite outfit I am obsessed and I'm
definitely wearing this for Easter
