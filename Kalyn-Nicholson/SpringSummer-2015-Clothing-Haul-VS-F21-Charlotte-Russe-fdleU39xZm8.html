finally doing the hole that I promised
you guys I know on instagram around
Easter time I said how nah but you guys
be if I filmed another hall and you guys
all really wanted it so today I'm here
and I'm gonna be filming that hall for
you guys today
and let's just say I have a lot to show
you that said keep in mind a lot of the
things I purchased were for the vacation
I'm about to go on with my sister four
videos that were coming up blog posts
that were coming up and all that jazz so
normally I don't shop this much that's a
lie
usually I try not to shop this much but
that said at least I can feel a little
bit less guilty by showing it to you
guys so I'm just trying to hop right in
because I do have quite a few things to
show you also guys don't worry you'll be
seeing a lot of pictures and videos and
all of these clothes that's why I didn't
do a try own version of this haul
because pretty much everything I'm
showing you guys right now is going to
be in either blog posts videos or on my
Instagram so just hold tight you're
gonna see lots of pictures and videos of
all of this stuff soon okay I'm gonna
start with one of the things that I was
most excited for so I'm following this
Twitter that has like bohemian pictures
and bohemian stuff all the time
and they tweeted about this company
called the elephant pants and so me
being like the classic target clicked on
the link ended up on the website and of
course made in order because I could not
refuse for those of you that don't know
my favorite animal is elephants I am
obsessed with elephants I find them so
cute so giant but so humble and I just
love them so when I went on and I was
looking through their elephant pants
which I'm like obsessed with they're
like the big baggy bohemian type pants
and they're so fun for just lounging
around in the summer or the spring and
you guys are soon gonna find out that
I'm quite the hippie
I looked it through and it turns out
that they actually donate one or two
dollars from every order to the African
Wildlife Foundation so they help keep
elephants out of harm's way and save
them from bad situations and all that
stuff so I couldn't refuse so that is
the first thing I'm gonna show you guys
now if you follow me on snapchat you
would have already seen them but they
are these little baggy bohemian elephant
pants so they're like nice and tight
right around your waist and they're
quite like there's like this much of the
tightness so
they're really flattering and then
they're just super baggy after that and
then my favorite part is that they're
tight at the bottom like I'm really
weird about like big baggy pants like
this I like it when they tight tighten
around your ankles and then of course
huge slouchy pockets that's one though
I've said to check it out these ones are
the purple ones but they have a lot of
different styles and then the other
thing I got from there was also just a
bracelet but it was too big for my wrist
so I wrapped it around twice and made it
an anklet this is the little anklet that
I got and it's I got the one with brown
little beads on it and it's just got a
little elephant on the side so it's
super cute also I'm gonna leave links to
a lot of this stuff on my blog post so
just check out for that link down below
moving forward I'm gonna go into
Victoria's Secrets so recently I went to
Victoria's Secret and again some of
these things you guys may have seen this
is more of a collective haul one of the
things being my cell phone case that was
one of the things I picked up that day
and it's the pink and white stripes with
the Victoria Secret at the bottom and
I'm in love with it so that is the phone
case that I picked up from Victoria
Secret next my workout gear was in need
of a little bit of a refreshment so I
picked up a pair of leggings and these
are just from the pink like the McCoys
Iker pink and I have this weird thing
where when I work out I like cropped
legging so I don't like liking seco all
the way down to my ankles so I just got
a standard pair of cropped Victoria
Secret leggings and I just they have
like the front pocket for your keys or
anything or sometimes I'll put my ipod
in there if I don't have my armband so
those are the leggings I got next I got
a new sports bra and this is from
Victoria's Secret brand not the pink
brand and it looks like this and it's
got a bunch of neon like geometric hole
print all over it and it's neon green on
the inside so that is the sportswear I
got and then in the back of the straps
actually crisscross which is really cool
and then from the sale rack I picked up
this little t-shirt it's the Victoria
Secret pink and it's got like the
sequences all over it it's like gold
with silver on the outside and then it
says 86 on this black sleeve so that is
the t-shirt that I got from the sale
rack next to my Canadian folks you guys
will know what urban planet is but for
those of you that don't open planet is
in a way kind of like a Canadian version
of Charlotte Russe kind of again you may
have seen these
my snapchat I picked up these really
like cotton tie-dye shorts and they just
got like the Rope the Rope tie at the
front and I just thought these would be
nice for going to the cottage or just
your like a relaxing lazy day in the
summer or the spring and I've just been
obsessed with tie-dye which you will
notice so those are the shorts that I
picked up and I believe they were $12
the next pair of shorts I picked up I'm
obsessed with and they are these like
crochet shorts here and again they have
like a rope tie at the front with little
beads on the end and they are so comfy
super stretchy and gonna be so cute with
almost any crop top for the summer and
these were I think twenty dollars and of
course next are another pair of shorts
as you can see this is kind of like a
spring /summer haul since I'm starting
to pick up things for the summertime but
I needed a new pair of just like
distressed jean shorts so that is what I
picked up next and they just have like
all the ripping in the front but then
the pocket covers it up so you can't see
through obviously and they are just
high-waisted cropped shorts and they're
like the acid or light wash and of
course another new obsession of mine is
kimonos so the kimonos that I picked up
were these two here this one is just
like a black kind of knitted or
crocheted kimono and then my favorite
part is that it's got the fringe on the
sleeves and it also has the fringe at
the bottom and this one's nice and
slouchy and they're just gonna be really
cute for throwing on outfits especially
for the spring where it's not warm
enough to go it without a coat just yet
and then the next one is nice and
tropical and you'll definitely be seeing
this in my videos from my vacation that
I'm going on with my sister but this one
was twelve dollars and it's just like
chiffon type material and it's got white
with like the poem leaves and pinky of
magenta ish flowers all over it and this
is my obsession right now like this is
probably one of the other favorite
things that I got from this haul and I
absolutely love it
so speaking of vacation who can go on
vacation without some bathing suits
so speaking of vacation who can go on
vacation without some bathing suits so
these are the two bathing suits I picked
up they are both from triangle and I
will show you the styles that I decided
to go with the first one I got was this
one here it's the one that zips up in
the front and I got it I believe it's
strawberry kiss but I incase I'm wrong
on that I'll leave it down below but
this is what it looks like it's got like
a hot neon pink with a coral up top it
might not show up as bright on camera
and then in the back it's got like like
a light baby pink and it's all outlined
in black and it zips up in the front as
well as it clips in the back I think
it's like strawberry lemonade kiss or
strawberry kiss or something like that
and then the bottoms look just like this
and hema but it is the material from
triangle and they are so comfy and just
really flattering and again they have
the same color scheme so that is the one
bathing suit that I got the next one is
another one that I'm obsessed with and
it's this one here if you guys saw like
my pictures and stuff from Cuba you'll
know that I picked up the same style in
baby pink so I decided to get a royal
blue since I find this color looks so
nice against tan skin so I picked up
this one and it's just like the typical
triangle top and then again just the
standard bottoms but in the blue color
so next I'm gonna go into Charlotte
Russe and I picked up a little bundle of
joy from there the first thing I'm going
to show you are these boots they are
these like suede tan colored boots with
a little bit of fringe on the side and
then the my favorite part is that the
heel is like a dark chocolate so it like
really stands out and these are gonna be
really cute for the spring and you can
pair this with almost any outfit and
make it just look so nice and I just
love the light tan or light gray color
booties for like the springtime because
they're just a lighter color next I
picked up these shorts here and they're
just like light baggy or shorts and
super comfy for the spring and the
summertime and they have just like a
Paisley navy blue and white print and
then on the bottom they have this
crochet detailing on each end so those
are the shorts that I picked up next is
this romper and I've already uploaded
the blog post in this romper so I'll
leave a link to it down below if you
guys want to see what it looks like on
or styled but this is what the romper
looks nicely or like boho print all over
it in navy blue and burgundy my favorite
part is that the sleeves are like the
big giant bell sleeves and then in the
back again my favorite part is that it's
like a nice open back next is this
little crop top or bust EA or whatever
you want to call it but it is this
little tank top thing here
and this I was present pleasantly
surprised actually fits perfectly and
holds my girls up which is like such a
find in my situations all along the
bottom has that cage detailing and the
back just zips up and it actually is
really really flattering the next little
romper I have to show you guys is this
one here it's got like a nice floral
tropical print and some crochet at the
top and my favorite part is that it
actually hangs off your shoulders so if
you were to wear it it me to go on like
this and you have a whole open neck and
shoulders and it fits kind of slouchy so
you can wear it if you're bloated or you
can just like eat all day and not have
to worry about it because it's not tight
and it's so cute the last thing I have
to show you guys from Charlotte Russe is
a pair of shoes I got here so I just
picked up these little white sandals
with like a shorter wedge and they I
just aren't so comfy and I just wanted a
nice pair of like white shoes like this
that were comfy for the spring and
summer because you can style it with
almost any outfit and it will look cute
so now moving into my package from
forever 21 the first thing that I picked
out was this hat here and the blog post
with this hat is going to be going off
in just a couple days and it's a flat
brim so you wear it like this and oh
there we go it's a flat brim so you just
pop it on and it looks so cute with so
many outfits and I just kind of find out
adds a little bit of that edge to like
most of your outfits I've been obsessed
with hats lately if you guys haven't
noticed so the next thing I picked up is
another fav of mine from this haul and
it's this giant like poncho style dress
this dress is my life and I was so upset
because when I went back on the website
I think it might be sold out I can't
seem to find it anymore
they have similar styles though which is
very good but this dress you just kind
of pop it on and then in the very middle
it's got strings so you can tighten it
nice and tight this dress is so
flattering but it is so cute and very
very boho and I'm just so obsessed with
it so these are the little booties I
picked up from forever 21 again they
have this little fringe detailing and
they did have these boots and quite a
few colors so again check out the link
as they have darker Browns lighter
Browns grays and this is like the
grayish taupe color they have and I
found it matched nicely with that hat
like I just told you I have a new
obsession with hats so this is the next
time I got it's like a big giant floppy
hat gonna be
for the beach so you just like pop it on
and it's got like the obvious like
wicker material but it's got white
detailing around it as well as around
the rim and this is just gonna be so
cute with like a nice maxi dress or a
nice maxi skirt for the spring and the
summer and like I've already mentioned I
am obsessed with elephants and I picked
up this shirt from forever 21 because I
just couldn't say no it was this little
tank top shirt here and it's got again
some white crochet along the bottom rim
which is such a cute detail and it's got
little baby elephants all over it and I
just love it and it's such a
comfy relaxing tank top to wear like
pretty much anytime so I've been wearing
this quite a bit and I love it and again
on kimonos I got this kimono from
forever 21 they were close to selling
out on it so I ended up just getting it
in a bigger size because I find kimonos
look better the bigger the bag ah I find
kimonos look better the begi er they are
anyways so it's this little kimono here
and it's got like a red purple orange
cream kind of theme going around with
the next thing that I got from forever
21 is there's this tie-dye print dress
here which again like I said you guys
wouldn't see it that I have an obsession
with tie-dye I got a nice like v line in
the front and it's got two straps that
go across to the back and it's this
tie-dye print it's really really
flattering it's gonna be really nice for
like the beach or anything in the summer
and then in the back it's just got like
a strap and a little bit of an open back
right here and then last but not least
one of my favorite new obsessions are
these shorts and they are just like
baggy comfy shorts and they're red and
you can get these again I think in a
couple other colors and these were also
on sale for about eight or nine dollars
