Oh
but hey guys and welcome to day three of
you Tober for today's video we are going
to be making some freakin scrumptious
Starbucks recipes right from home
I love making you know really yummy
fall-related drinks around this time of
year and there's a few recipes that I
already had myself so all I did was
search up a couple other ones and came
up with five different Starbucks recipes
well one of them isn't necessarily a
Starbucks drink you could get it at
Starbucks if you really wanted to there
are also some options for those of you
that don't like coffee also if you guys
are following me already I'm going to
leave my Twitter and my Instagram right
here so you guys can go click away I am
doing tweet tober on my Twitter where I
post a photo every single day for the
month of October and a lot of those
photos usually end up on my Instagram as
well as like some really cool fall
fashion photos so be sure to go check
out my Instagram as well and other than
that if you guys want to find out how to
make five delicious
fall drink recipes and just keep
watching so the first drink I'm going to
be showing you guys is a cinnamon Dolce
latte what you're going to want to do is
start out by making yourself a cup of
coffee but even better if you have a
special shots to make one of those as
well but if you don't just go ahead and
make yourself a medium cup of coffee on
your Keurig or Tassimo whatever it is
that you own and even just use a kettle
so once your coffee is made you're going
to want to add your favorite creamer I
like to use vanilla almond milk but you
could use coconut milk or whatever you
have and then I'm adding some cinnamon
in on top as well as some vanilla
extract to give it that you know vanilla
flavor then I'm adding some brown sugar
and some nutmeg to the mix as well and
there there are like actual increments
of this that you could use but I just
like to add it until it tastes the way
that I like it
mix it all up together and then on top
you can add some coconut milk so what
you're going to want to do is take a can
of whole fat coconut milk and put it in
the fridge overnight and it actually
creates the consistency of whipped cream
if you add some icing sugar and some
vanilla extract to it and then I just
sprinkled some cinnamon on top and there
you have your own at-home cinnamon Dolce
latte which is super super easy to make
and I'm actually going to show a
different cinnamon Dolce syrup later on
in the video as
and for those of you guys that don't
like coffee just go ahead and make a
giant cup of hot chocolate but if you do
like coffee then I suggest making this
as a mocha all I did was make a very
small cup of coffee and then add the hot
chocolate mix into it but like I said
you guys couldn't just make the normal
hot chocolate if you'd rather just have
a salted caramel hot chocolate and then
the brand amusing his Camino which this
is actually a vegan hot chocolate super
yummy and then I'm adding some almond
milk some caramel extract and some
vanilla extract and caramel extract is a
good dupe for those of you guys that are
vegan and can't use any caramel syrups
and then I'm going in with the hazelnuts
syrup from Starbucks which is actually
relatively pretty cheap if you guys go
and pick that up and then I'm adding
some sea salt mixing that all together
and then again I'm adding my coconut
milk whipped cream and some sea salt on
top super easy it's salted caramel mocha
or salted caramel hot chocolate and this
is friggin delicious it was so good next
I'm going to show you guys how to make a
pumpkin spice latte because what would
small drinks be at home if we didn't do
a PS L so I'm going ahead and making
myself a giant cup of coffee or again
you can use espresso if you would rather
do that as well and then I'm going in
with pumpkin pie filling a lot of people
will make this recipe with puree but I
find using the filling it just adds all
the sweetness without all of the
ingredients so it's so much easier then
I'm adding my almond milk and some
cinnamon as well as some pumpkin pie
spice which I just picked up from
Walmart it was like three dollars super
cheap and then sprinkling some cinnamon
on top you guys can go ahead with the
whipped cream again but I was actually
drinking all these this day so I didn't
want to add whipped cream to every
single one and a really easy way to make
a spin off on this too is to add the
caramel extract if you want to make a
caramel pumpkin spice latte super easy
and so good
and the fifth and last recipe is the
caramel apple spice if you guys have
ever had that before so this is a really
easy way to make some cinnamon Dolce
syrup at home which you can use for the
cinnamon Dolce latte as well so you're
just gonna want to boil some water with
a ton of cinnamon sticks crushed up into
the water bring it to a boil and then
let it simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes
and it's going to create this like
darker you know I don't even know how to
explain it just basically darker water
and then I'm adding about a cup of brown
sugar putting that back on the oven for
a little bit just until the brown sugar
melts and then that's a super easy way
to make cinnamon Dolce syrup at home
which is what they actually use in the
caramel apple spice and then I'm going
ahead and adding some apple cider you
guys could use apple juice for this too
but I prefer apple cider and then adding
my cinnamon Dolce syrup and you guys can
put the rest of the syrup into a
container in the fridge and let it cool
and then use that whenever you want for
your coffees as well and then yeah once
you've just warmed it up again you can
add some whipped cream and some caramel
drizzle on top or just drink it as is
and it's super super easy and the
yummiest care mapa spies ever at home
and you guys can save money on all of
these drinks making them at home so yeah
that's all of the recipes that I had to
show you guys

recipe you guys are going to try out or
