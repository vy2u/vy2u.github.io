for today's video I'm doing a vlog with
you guys I've been really getting into
vlogging lately I don't know why but
like any day that I'm not vlogging it
just it feels like morally wrong inside
but that said I have been vlogging blast
today it's gonna be blogging today and
vlogging for the rest of the week
because it is the first week of January
and today's video is gonna be all about
the new habits that I'm trying to deeply
ingrained into myself for the new year
as if we haven't already done enough new
year I'm back at it with another vlog so
in today's video I'm gonna be sharing
with you guys the first week of
basically my New Year's resolutions so
if you guys haven't seen it yet I
actually posted all of my 2018
resolution just on my blog which I will
put a link to down below won't come here
but people want to see you so if you
guys want to read up on my resolutions
because there's a few of them that I
can't do in this video because they're
not necessarily habits they're more like
things I want to do definitely go check
that out this week the main things that
I was trying to focus on is
incorporating daily meditation going to
bed at 11:00 and waking up at 7:00 which
is been the biggest one of how to
struggle by working out five times a
week writing everyday going to yoga once
this week cooking all of my meals I'm
gonna know take out this week anything
I'm craving that day I have to make from
home and try and make it as healthy as
possible so I've been cooking and then
just overall some little things that I
can do this week that contribute to my
overall big goals for 2018 they might
not be like daily habits but things like
researching condos researching podcasts
working on dream catchers things like
that so that that that's what I've been
documenting I'm currently on the third
day of all of these daily habits and so
far everything is going pretty well the
only thing that I haven't done is going
to sleep at 11:00 and waking up at 7:00
that one that one we need to fix it all
the other ones have been going pretty
well so right now I'm just about to
start my workday and I have
pretty heavy workload today and a lot of
things that have been kind of stressing
me up and I really need to do so before
I do anything the first thing I want to
do today is my meditation just to kind
of go in to like a work headspace
feeling a little bit more calm and not
so like not acting so much out of stress
but instead acting for more of a place
of like calm and collective and cool
energy I think for today's meditation
I'm going to use the headspace app the
very first day I did my meditation via
tarot cards I think I told you guys that
I got tarot cards for Christmas from my
sister and so that's kind of how I
decided to meditate on the first day for
me meditation is just anything that
helps you kind of just like play through
your mind or just like take a break and
and feel just like connected within if
that makes sense and so so that's how I
decided to meditate on the first day and
then last night I did my meditation with
the new app headspace I'm sponsored just
totally recommended to me by multiple
people
okay I can't I can't feel my well I do
so I decided to try that out for days
that I want to do more like guided
meditations so I did one last night and
I felt amazing afterwards
so before I basically enter work mode
for the day I'm gonna do a quick ten
minutes of a headspace on Taoiseach so
I've been using the air pods that Gregg
got me for Christmas when I do these
meditations because I feel like playing
them out loud sometimes I can hear too
much outside noise yeah there think
about the headspace app is it tells you
that it's better if you're sitting down
but meditation or anything in life is
what you make of it so for instance I
don't know I just like meditating laying
down I feel like it's easier for me to
relax into like the floor or into my bed
than it is for me to be sitting because
I'm very conscious all the time of like
punching my bat so that's a really long
explanation as to why I think it's okay
to lay down when you meditate but I'm
gonna do a quick 10 minute so that you
cannot do this while filming because I'm
very aware that there's a camera on me
I'm gonna pop these bad boys and do the
meditation they'll be back to update you
okay so that's two days in a row and I
have to say sometimes the guys voice
starts to bother me because I'll end up
getting into these really cool like head
places I'm very like calm and very at
ease or like I see something like I'm
kind of in a happy place and then his
voice comes through and I'm like no I
should have done the headspace app in my
meditation challenge maybe I'll do a new
one but damn they are really really good
they're really good for like helping you
relax in the moment and like be in
connection with
where you are let your brain just kind
of float and and see what thoughts come
to you and let them pass he brings you
back into like reality again and it's
just you feel so calm and insanely like
like I feel so insanely connected now it
sounds so cliche but it's true no I'm
gonna make myself a coffee so I can
combine that calmness with a little bit
of juice juice so that I have the
perfect duo just start getting some done
today
you
it's now getting close to five there's
still a few more things that I need to
do but I have about an hour right now so
I figure I'm going to go ahead and do my
writing for the days Lighting's bothered
me too much oh my god that's so much
better so one of the other really
important daily habits that I wanted to
start in greening into my everyday
routine is writing every day whether
it's you know writing in my journal
writing a poem writing music writing my
blog writing something for my books like
anything like that I basically just want
to ingrain the habit of writing
something every single day even if it
sucks I honestly love writing it's
something that I've done for as long as
I can remember when I stopped writing I
noticed that it actually starts to
affect like a lot of my happiness and
even just a lot of my creativity I think
with making it a habit to write
something every day even if it's not
perfect it kind of breaks that like
thought process where I put too much
pressure on what I'm writing that I stop
myself from actually writing I think the
first day I just wrote in my journal and
then last night I went through my yearly
horoscope and wrote out like a lot of
the stuff about it into my journal and
I'm not feeling like journaling right
now so I'm just gonna work on my blog if
you guys didn't know I've been posting a
lot more to my blog now and blog posts
go up every single Friday I don't think
that this blog post that I'm about to
write will be live by the time this
video is but if you end up creeping my
blog maybe in the next week or so you'll
see it
oh my god totally forgot to take a clip
while I was running but it is the first
run of the new year and I I just ran do
that see that right there that was my
fastest that I've come um there was one
point that I thought I was kind of maybe
gonna throw up so I slowed down a little
bit but how do I not slow down I think I
could have ran it in 25 so that's gonna
be my goal possibly for tomorrow if I
don't do hot yoga but I'm very I'm very
pleased first start of the new year and
it's my fastest 5k track pretty good
pretty good start to 2018 if you ask me
good morning guys what's up and is now
again your e6 I woke up just a few hours
ago and right now I'm actually just
throwing on my runners and my workout
gear to go for a run I am like feeling
very very tired I slept in a bit today
because Saturday how I could have kept
sleeping for like ever ended up making
myself get up at like 9:00 I'm gonna go
for my workout right now which will be
my fifth workout of the week got the
last 25 bucks in my knee jar to spend
some research on some stuff I want to do
today for my bigger goals because a lot
of that got pushed off throughout the
week I did some research on condos but I
want to research the things on podcasts
I'm gonna share with you guys what I've
been reading all week day actually marks
the one full year that I've been living
in Toronto tonight instead of tomorrow
night being my take out night I think
tonight's gonna be the first night that
I don't make a meal at home Greg and I
might go to the restaurant that I went
to the very first night I moved in that
might be the only break in my habits for
this video we're just gonna do a 5k
however long that takes me I'm not going
to try and force myself to do like a
super fast 5k that's gonna be today's
workout and then I'll touch back with
you guys when we move on to the next
habit of the week so now about to
partake in the meditation portion of
today's habit for me the meditation I I
think I've just jumped fully over into
headspace because even though like I
found that tarot cards and stuff kind of
like my own form of meditation the
headspace out I definitely have found to
make the biggest difference so I've been
doing them for about 10 minutes a day
and honestly I found this to be one of
the biggest habits that I've formed this
week that I think is making the biggest
difference every single time I do when I
feel so I feel so like weightless
afterwards things that I would normally
be very stressed about this week are
like not bothering me as much and I
especially find that the meditation has
been hopping when I feel like I can't
really focus the only thing is that I
truly cannot I cannot vlog myself doing
this because I'm so aware of the fact
that I'm a filmmaker we'll be back
I'm hoping that you understand you ain't
the man to tell you into man just pray
to God keep you in the plan
you ain't the man to tell you when it's
God but I've been on a mission since the
day we brought up every time we drop in
and we know they thought of ways to
bring me down but when they hit on here
with sound cuz that's the way you gotta
Ackman up and realize been around me on
my own I got a team on my own
so what you're trying to do see a common
foot squatting by you panel oh those are
now officially Sunday January 7th which
means yes it is a Geist day and I have
very well been jesting I have a few more
hours left to do some cleaning I need to
finish off some laundry and then I'm
actually gonna do some of the bigger
term goals that I was talking about
earlier like cleaning off my bathtub
like scrubbing the crap out of my
bathtub I'm doing that today I'm also
reading my second book of 2018 I
finished this book this week it was big
magic one of the other big resolutions I
have is to read two books every single
month ie
a book every two weeks so I actually
ripped through this one so quickly it's
called big magic creative living beyond
fear by Elizabeth Gilbert she also wrote
Eat Pray Love
you need like you need to get it you
need to read it it is the most amazing
thing I ripped through it so quickly and
now I'm also reading I like to read a
fiction and a nonfiction at the same
time so now I'm just trying to finish
off Harry Potter in the order of Phoenix
and yeah I also picked up some new books
and I think they're gonna be in a 2018
reading list or a they're gonna be in
another video so I'm not gonna show you
that I mean that's pretty much it there
you have it folks that was my first week
of resolutions turned into habits
definitely miserably failed on going to
bed at 11 waking up at 7 that's gonna be
the biggest one that I think I need to
work on if you don't make your habit a
daily thing it's not going to deeply
ingrained like the first two nights that
I didn't go to bed at 11 it made it so
that the rest of the week I was like
whatever I didn't do it the first two
days the ones that I did every single
day it was like if I stop now that I'm
gonna lose my daily streak I've also
done a whole video before on habits
which I will link up on the screen or
put down below aside from that I feel
like this videos already gonna be pretty
long so I will let you guys go I hope
you guys enjoyed this little habit
challenge we cover the news you guys
stick to your news resolutions this week
or have you already tanked them like my
11:00 p.m. 7:00 a.m. and other than that
