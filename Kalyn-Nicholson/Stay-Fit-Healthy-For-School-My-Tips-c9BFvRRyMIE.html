to be talking to you guys about how to
stay fit for school I'm also filming at
a new location I'm just gonna kind of go
back and forth between where I film
whether it'll be in my office or in my
bedroom and yeah so that's the only
reason the only explanation I have for
you for why I'm sitting here today I
don't know why I just suddenly had an
accent there but yeah um anyway so I
asked you guys in an Instagram video
what I asked you guys in an Instagram
picture whether you guys wanted to see a
stay fit for school or how to find
motivation to get fit and healthy and
the majority of you guys said how to
stay fit for school a lot of you guys
also said both and a lot of you guys
also said motivation but the biggest
amount I noticed was the stay fit for
school but don't worry guys hold tight
I'm gonna do both videos so this video
though it's just gonna be this date fit
for school but the - motivation one is
coming so one really easy tip to help
stay fit or healthy or even if you're
just looking to get fit and healthy for
school is to pack your lunches at night
don't be that person that tries to pack
your lunch in the morning because we all
know you're gonna sleep in you're gonna
be running out the door going to grab
food and you're either going to grab
junk processed food or even where she
will just grab no food at all and you'll
starve all day and nobody wants to
starve all day okay if you prepare
yourself at night even if you have to
take an extra 15 minutes before you go
to sleep go to sleep 15 minutes later
and go downstairs and just make yourself
a nice like whole healthy lunch a really
good idea you can do too is like let's
say Sunday's you can meal prep your
lunches for the following week so this
is something I especially did in college
but you could do this in high schools to
just like make yourself a pasta salad
and make a huge batch of this pasta
salad and put a lot of veggies in it or
whether it's rice salad or like a quinoa
salad whatever you want to do then you
have it for Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday and Friday and then all you
have to do when you go to pack your
lunch is just throw some snacks in there
so that's a really really good way to
kind of you know make sure you're eating
healthy throughout the week as well as
just
killing two birds with one stone I hate
that thing I don't want to kill birds
it's like you know getting two things
done at once that's not any better so
pack your lunch at night or better yet
meal prep and then pack your lunch at
night was just a few snacks and yeah
then you're set to go and you're making
sure that you're being conscious of the
things you're eating my next tip is to
bring a reusable water bottle not like
if you can't use a plastic water bottle
if you plan to reuse it cut down on the
plastic bottles that are going in the
landfills and get a reusable water
bottle you can find them at like pink
you can find them at Walmart if you want
to just get a really cheap and
affordable one and bring it to school
with you every day even if you're not
allowed to have water on your desk keep
it in your bag keep it in your locker
keep it wherever and just constantly for
you fill it throughout the day so you're
keeping yourself extremely hydrated and
nourished and it's just gonna help your
brain when you're at school it's gonna
help your body you're gonna feel better
you're gonna feel more awake
you're gonna feel more just alert so yes
I know I probably sound like your mother
right now being like bring water and
drink water but it is actually so
important so I know with school
schedules you can be really super busy
and it can be really hard to find time
to work out so if you can just take like
30 minutes out of your night or 30
minutes out of your morning and just go
for a run and if you can't go for a run
go for a walk or hike walk your dog just
you know get out and just get moving
like don't put so much pressure on
yourself with going back to school and
having a busy work schedule to feel like
you have to do this crazy workout all
the time not telling you guys to stress
out about getting like a gym membership
and having to go to the gym every single
day and do this killer crazy workout
like if all you can do is just take your
walk take your walk for a dog all you
can do is take your dog for a walk
that's still better than just sitting
around and not doing anything at all if
you have time to do that do it but if
you don't just take like 30 minutes and
just go walk your dog or go for a quick
little jog around the block even or
whatever just go for like a little hike
or something or walk to the store to get
something instead of driving there you
know just get a little bit of a workout
in so yeah another option you could do
too is just like quick little circuits
inside your house so when you take study
breaks if you're taking like a 15-minute
study break just do a couple quick
bodyweight exercises just
in your bedroom you don't need any crazy
equipment you don't need a gym
membership you don't need anything you
can even do it naked if you want to all
you have to do is just like a couple
sets of squats you could do a couple
sweats of lunges you could get just
little mini weights which is something
that's good for those of you that might
be going to college or in dorm rooms
just get those little mini hand weights
or ankle weights and just do quick
little circuit exercises in your room or
if you're at home and you're going to
high school you don't even have to leave
the comfort of your bedroom you know
just just make sure you stay off the bed
because if you stay off the bed then
you're less likely to just kind of flop
there and be like hey I'm done I did one
pushup just you know get on the floor
get down there and just workout just do
a quick little 15 minute if you're only
taking about 30 seconds between each set
and you're moving on to the next one or
the next one or the next one that's
actually even a little bit of a cardio
workout too because you're constantly
moving so you can do a bit of cardio or
you can just do circuit and cardio
whatever whatever it is or find some
YouTube videos do some yoga in your
bedroom there's so many options you can
do without even leaving your room if you
guys want a video where I can show you
guys just some quick circuits you can do
in your room just quick little workouts
that are super easy quick 15 minute
workouts then just let me know and I can
definitely do that for you guys the next
tip is don't you dare skip breakfast I
used to be that person that skipped
breakfast
trust me I used to be like oh yeah well
you know breakfast kind of makes me feel
sick or I don't really feel like good in
the morning or I'm not really that
hungry in the morning and then for some
reason I couldn't understand how when I
get home from school I would binge like
crazy I would binge like I'm talking I'm
mixing Kraft Dinner in high school while
eating Oreos and peanut butter and I
have a PB&amp;amp;J on the side like I would
binge like crazy binge or even if it's
not right after school you might notice
you're binging really late at night
right before you go to bed you're like
all the sudden scarfing in all this food
and you may not think it's because of
breakfast but I can pretty much put
money on the fact that if you're
skipping breakfast you're going to be
binging later on in the day even if
you're not hungry just have a quick
smoothie i buy these are their smoothies
from the grocery store a piece of toast
just some oatmeal just a smoothie a
piece of fruit have a couple pieces of
fruit have a pint of berries or have a
couple
anas just anything that's going to give
you a little bit of nourishment in your
day it's not only going to help boost
your metabolism in the morning but it's
also going to help you keep from binging
later on in the day so eat breakfast
also with back-to-school especially for
those of you that might be in like
college or university or even just in
high school and finals or exams or tests
those words just like release the stress
in your body and all of a sudden you're
like study study study right and so you
drink a lots of espresso and coffee and
energy drinks and all this stuff that is
completely terrible for you so you are
speaking to a lover of coffee here try
drinking tea if you're someone that's
been drinking a lot of coffee a lot of
coffee at school a lot of coffee before
school try switching one of two of those
out for tea instead this is something
that I've been doing lately and y'all
know how much I'm obsessed with coffee
but I've been switching on my coffees
for decaf and I've been drinking teas
instead of coffee all the time because
just all that caffeine in my body it's
not good for me it's not something that
I'm supposed to be ingesting a lot of so
I have tried to kick a little bit of
caffeine which you guys should do too
because caffeine is terrible terrible
terrible for your body and if you read
the book Skinny Bitch it actually says
that drinking caffeine can actually
cause weight gain just try it it's not
gonna be easy but we'll all try together
and since I'm sitting here telling you
guys you know how to stay fit and
healthy in the school year I'm also
talking about your mental health you
need to take like 15 minutes of your day
and just just de-stress just do
something that is just for you and
de-stress whether it's meditating if
you're not into meditating maybe it's
reading maybe it's you know watching a
TV show or you know just 15 20 30
minutes however much time you can I
always like to do this right before bed
I usually just like light candles and I
play music and I'll either write in my
journal or I'll just like I'll do
something like like a mandala or I'll
draw or alright or watch just like a
quick episode of friend it keeps the
sane and it keeps us level it keeps us
from like exploding with stress and
pressure all the time and it's just
having that little chunk of time to just
do something that's just for you and to
relax and decompress and de-stress it's
just so important for your mental health
so please
take care of that guys take care of
yourselves and take care of your brain
and yeah remember not to stress too much
about how you look and just go by how
you feel okay the biggest thing with
these fitness videos is I never want you
guys to obsess over what's on the scale
or what your measurements are or
whatever how you look just try and go by
how you feel and if you aren't feeling
good or you're not feeling like
comfortable or confident in yourself
then first ask yourself why is it
because of a superficial thing or is it
because that the inside of you just
doesn't feel that good and then once you
figure that one out if it's superficial
you need to let it go you need to fight
that you need to fight that demon and
you need to let it go and if it's not if
it's just that you don't feel healthy or
you don't feel good on the inside then
do something to change it but don't ever
stress about how you look or what
numbers on a scale or what number your
measurements are because there is no
definition to what is perfectly healthy
or what is perfectly fit there's no set
way to look there's no set way to feel
only you will know what you are at your
absolute healthiest everybody is
completely different everybody feels
different acts different looks different
so you just have to go about what makes
you feel the best about yourself both
internally and just how you feel about
yourself on the outside - you have to
love yourself for what you are and what
you look like and who you are so yeah
that's my rant for the end of this video
and other than that I'm wishing you guys
all the luck in your new school year or
your new work here and I love you guys
so much and I'll see you guys all in a
future Fitness Friday or just in another
video so yeah bye guys
