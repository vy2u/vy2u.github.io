showing you some summer date night
outfits and makeup so starting with the
makeup I am using the Maybelline fit me
shine free foundation stick this is
going to keep my face nice and matte all
night and just blending this in with a
blending brush to conceal my dark
circles I'm using Maybelline instant age
rewind and just blending this in with my
middle finger with light patting motion
to set everything into place I'm using
NYC's smooth skin and just buffing this
in all over my skin
now I'm using Annabelle's eyebrow pencil
to fill in my brows because I have a
very very sparse brows and just
reshaping them as I go since this is a
date night look you can go a little bit
more edgy with your brows than usual and
then I'm using Maybelline's great lash
to set it all in place for eyeshadow
primer I'm using I heart stage by
essence I think it was like two or three
dollars for me to buy and then just
blending this in with my finger I'm
using all the colors from this Rimmel
London HD eyes in English rose and I'm
using the big baby pink color just
putting this all over my lid and up on
my upper brow bone and this is going to
make the blending a lot easier then I'm
taking the lightest taupe color and
blending this into my crease with a big
blending brush and then I'm going in
with the second color it's more of a
Primrose taupe and putting this into the
crease as well and then taking the
darkest purpley and putting this on the
outside and then of course blending this
all in and you want to blend a lot a lot
of life just to make it look a little
bit more seamless and smoky
then I'm using that same dark purple
taupe and putting this underneath my
lower lash line then I'm rooming my
bottom line my bottom lash line with a
white eyeliner from maybelline and then
I'm going to go in with my favorite
L'Oreal linear intense liquid eyeliner
and just doing my natural everyday
eyeliner you guys can skip eyeliner if
you like but I decided to do it
then we want some romantic lashes so I'm
going ahead and curling my lashes and
then using L'Oreal telescopic two coats
sometimes three coats of this it really
all depends on how big and balumptuous'
you want your lashes but this really
separates and lengthens um so I love
this mascara and then I'm going in with
my Rimmel natural bronzer this doesn't
have any shimmers or anything into it
because I wanted to keep it nice an
actual since we used a lot of shimmer on
the face and I'm just contouring my face
with this on my cheekbone and then I'm
going right over top of that just on top
of it with NYC's color wheel this is a
really natural-looking blush and just
popping that Freight on top and blending
it in for lips I'm using Strawberry
Shortcake by Revlon it's this really
pretty versatile pink color and putting
this all over my lips and then I'm going
over it with a baby pink lip gloss from
essence which again I think only costed
me like two or three dollars
so now that our makeups all set let's
move on to outfits for this first outfit
I decided to go a little bit more sexy
by wearing these silk cheetah shorts and
I have a black tank top over top of it
with lace detailing I wore a gold cuff a
little satchel that I have with a gold
chain and my nails are a really pretty
color from a Walmart that I'll post down
below and these heels are from Charlotte
Russe so that is my entire first outfit
yeah the next outfit I decided to go a
little bit more flowy and pretty for
summer so wearing this high-low dress in
a coral color with these bracelets that
I've prepared all together and then for
shoes I am just wearing these white
flats from Lulu's and that is the
complete second outfit and then for the
third and last outfit I decided to go
with high-waisted shorts and a little
busty a so this busty that you see me
wearing here is actually from forever 21
and I'm obsessed with it and it's a
really pretty summer pattern and then I
have these high-waisted base shorts to
go with it and these white shoes from
what sale so those are all the outfits
and the makeup tutorial for your summer
date night I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you all soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
