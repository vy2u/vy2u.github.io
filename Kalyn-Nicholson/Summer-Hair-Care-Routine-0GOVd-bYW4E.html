sharing with you my summer haircare
routine so I'm going to start out with
showing you guys exactly what I do when
I'm in the shower and when I get out of
the shower and so the products that I
use so because I am blonde I do use this
shimmer lights toning shampoo but my
regular shampoo is long-term
relationship by hermel essence is I'd
like to use 3 minute miracle by Aussie
and I like to use this coconut proclaim
that I got from Sally's Beauty Supply
all of these products make my hair feel
nice and soft and keep it from getting
too tangled or dry in the summer time so
my next tip for you guys is to always
use a thick tooth comb when combing out
wet hair you never want to use a brush
using a wide tooth comb prevents hair
breakage although you still will always
get some of your brushing your hair when
it's wet it easily do tangles and all
hair types need it so I try my best not
to use heat at all in the summer so I'll
usually just do my makeup or sleep on my
hair so it dries but if I have to use
heat I use heat protectant so I will
list all the heat protectants and anti
humidities that I put in my hair down
below and then I go ahead and try and
blow-dry it when my hair is as dry as I
can possibly let it from air I like to
use the coldest setting on my blow-dryer
as well just to make sure I don't use as
much heat on my hair adds normally so
next I go ahead and put in a foil or
cream into my hair this is to keep my
ends for me to dry and unconditioned in
the summer so two of my favorite non
heat hairstyles are the top not bun so
you just pull all your head all your
hair sorry on the top of your head and
tie it into a little top knot and go
ahead and set it into place with an
elastic this is probably my number one
go-to when I don't want to use heat on
my hair
and the next one is a normal braid so I
like to put in my extensions for this
one so my hair feels super long but I
just go ahead and braid my hair so doing
this hairstyle again uses minimal heat
and it looks really really cute for the
summertime and pretty much goes with
everything
and last but not least of course I take
my hair by dimin Caesar hair bits I will
leave a link to them down below if you
guys are interested they just help your
hair grow and keep it nice and strong so
I hope you guys enjoyed this and I'll
see you guys on a future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
