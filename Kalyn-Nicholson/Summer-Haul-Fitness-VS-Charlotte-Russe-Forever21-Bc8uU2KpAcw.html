fitness haul for you guys since I
recently picked up a few items of
clothing for like working out and stuff
but then I realized there wasn't that
much fitness stuff to show you guys and
I was planning on doing another haul
later on that was kind of more of just
like summer clothing and just stuff I've
purchased in general lately so I decided
to kind of mesh the two together and do
one big haul
I'll start with the fitness related
things that I got first also please
forgive my hair I showered and I'm
leaving really soon for out of town so I
didn't have time to like do my hair for
this video so I'm rocking the au
naturale so hopefully you guys don't the
first thing I'm going to show you guys
is the fitness stuff that I got from
forever 21 I really like forever 21
because I like their quality of fitness
clothes based on price sometimes I will
splurge and get like things from Nike or
Lululemon but lately I've been kind of
sticking more towards like forever 21
the first thing I got was this sports
bra and it's like a double lined sports
bar I just got it in plain black um it's
basically their maximum support sports
bra and it was only seventeen ninety and
basically it's like double line so it
offers like maximum support which is
something I kind of need because I
normally double up on sports bras
especially if I'm running or doing any
sort of like up and down cardio in the
back it's like crisscross straps next
I've been getting into running outside
again picked up some running shorts from
forever 21 which are kind of like a
two-in-one so they have like a lining
underneath Wow these are not showing up
as bright as they actually are in real
life these are like neon neon orange
like the spandex II type of material and
underneath they just continue down like
that until like spandex shorts but then
they have this like lining over top of
it that's loose and again this is like
waterproof material so it wicks away any
moisture if it's raining and the cool
thing is it has a zipper in the back
this kind of reminds me of like a little
lemon pair of shorts but they have the
zipper in the back you can put like your
keys or your phone in and yeah they're
just like a nice pair of just running
shorts and I go out them in bright
orange and then I actually got two pairs
this one's a little bit different
these ones are black and they don't have
the spandex material on top it's like
the cinched material on top and
they do have like strings inside if you
want to tighten them but they do have
the spandex type shorts or Spanx
underneath like this but this one's like
a salt-and-pepper one and then the black
material over top and that is what they
look like and then these ones were 1990s
next I am in desperate need of like tank
tops and workout tops so I picked up a
little tank top so this is the one I got
from forever 21 it's like really low
scooped back or whatever on each side
it's just like a really thin piece till
pretty low so it keeps you nice and
breezy and this one was only $12.90
and it's hard to see but it's kind of
see-through and it's like striped white
mesh so that is the tank top and the
last Fitness related item I have to show
you guys is from Victoria's Secret I
went on their semi and semi-annual sale
and picked up a pair of leggings so they
have these leggings on sale and I love
Victoria Secret leggings and I love
cropped leggings like I'm someone that
when I work out if I'm wearing leggings
I have to be like cropped like right
there like I can't do like all the way
to my ankle for some reason it just
bothers me so they're like a Tiffany or
like a robin egg blue on top which isn't
showing up very well on camera but
they're like an aqua kind of color and
then they go down in they're cropped and
they have little aqua stripes and then
just a little puppy dog for Victoria
Secret pink okay now I'm just going to
jump into the rest of the stuff that I
have to show you guys which is quite a
lot so I hope you guys are in the mood
to look at some clothes so I'll show you
guys everything else from forever 21
first next thing I got is just this
bathing suit top here and I'm like kind
of obsessed with this style of bathing
suit top at the bralette type bikini
tops and this is what it looks like here
it's like neon and floral and the cool
thing is is that the back it's like all
these kind of like straps and then you
tie it off and you can tighten it here
and I just like the way it looks I find
it's like the most flattering bikini top
that I've found for like my body type so
that is the little bikini top I got next
is this romper here and it's got like
the tight neck that you guys know I'm
kind of obsessed with where it's kind of
like Ray
to your neck and kind of highs like more
cutout of your shoulders here and the
top part is nice and stretchy and then
you can choose to tighten it how tight
you want in the back with this strap
here so it's kind of like a little
halter top connected to shorts of the
same print obviously because it is a
rubber and it's kind of like a purpley
orange print and it's definitely very
tribal boho which is totally me so that
is the romper that I got the next thing
I got was this little pair of shorts
here and I love the material of them
they're kind of cottony which is
different because I thought they're
going to be more like the material of
the romper I just showed you guys but
they're more soft and cotton so I really
like them and they have again just kind
of like this tribal print going on and
nice and tight at the top but like like
really baggy so they're just super comfy
for the summer so next I got this maxi
dress for 2990 and then you just tie it
around the neck it's a lot like the
other one I just showed you at the top
where it's like a kind of like a crew I
don't know what the top of this is
called but it's like you tie it tight
around your neck and then it halters
again and it's got the stretch of your
material this is like a floral white red
and black pattern and it just kind of
goes all the way down and it's a maxi
dress so I've been really obsessed with
maxi dresses because they're really easy
to just throw on in their company
especially for like traveling and stuff
so the next thing I got was something
I've been like waiting to got it for a
little while now and it is just this
little Calvin Klein duo so I got the
sports bra like this it's just a white
sports bra with the band and then the
bottoms to go with it that's kind of
weird is this weird I don't know but
anyway these are the little bit bottoms
that I got and they're like just like a
matching set and they're just comfy for
kind of lounging around and I got these
from the bay and I actually got a set in
like a Tiffany blue color too but the
top bra part like a bra or sports bra or
bra let however you want to call it
hasn't come in yet but this is the other
pair that I got next I will go into
Victoria's Secret and this is the little
beach bag that I picked up for Victoria
Secret I have a lot of Beach related
videos that I plan on coming out with
this summer like tons of them are
planned so I needed a nice beach bag to
hit hit the beach with so this is the
beach bag that I got
in Victoria's Secret it's kind of like a
neon palm tree pattern and I'm obsessed
with palm tree pattern so I'm like
everything the straps are black and in
white they say pink all over them they
have like a bunch of pockets on the
outsides and then when you open it up
it's just like nice and big and it's got
that material that's okay to kind of get
wet so if you have to like wash it out
with sand and stuff from the beach this
is the beach bag that I got so the first
thing I have to show you guys is a
bikini and this one's really cool
because it's one of those reversible
style bikinis this is what it looks like
here this is the top it's kind of like a
tiffany blue or like a robin egg blue
again with purple detailing like lilac
purple and then it's got these tassels
to tie and the thing I like is that you
can like choose how tight you want the
little woven part in the Middle's and
it's just kind of like a halter and it's
one of those style bralette style tops
again so I find it super flattering and
the other side is the reverse and it's
like the purple color and then the
bottoms are very similar they're like
the purple with the tribal print and
then you can reverse them but I like to
wear it so that the bottoms are purple
and the top is the tribal print the next
thing I picked up was just a little one
piece because I don't have a one piece
bikini or one piece bathing suit I guess
and Ryan I are planning on doing some
traveling so I wanted to pick up a one
piece just for like certain things I
plan on doing and this is what the back
looks like it's a really low back and it
just has like a strap of material going
down and it's just like a standard black
one-piece from Victoria Secret this
one's on setting for like 20 dollars so
that is why I picked it up and you just
can't go wrong with having just like a
good one piece in your closet the next
thing I picked up was also a pair of
high-waisted bikini bottoms and I've
really wanted to try out the
high-waisted bikini bottom look and I
just decided to pick up a pair so this
is what they look like sorry this is
like a really weird way of showing you
guys but they have just like a bunch of
straps on the sides and then they go up
into like a high waist and then last but
not least I just picked up this little
like tunic throw over hoodie type thing
it's really light which is nice for the
summer so when Ryan and I we go to the
cottage or wherever we end up doing if
I'm just like outside at nighttime it's
a chilly or night
just like a nice throw over or pullover
sweater but
nice and loose and it's a thin material
and then last but not least is Charlotte
Russe so I'm going to show you guys the
things that I picked up from Charlotte
since you guys know that's like one of
my favorite places to shop online the
first thing I got was this maxi dress
here like I already told you guys I've
been kind of obsessed with maxi dresses
this summer and this is what it looks
like it's red and it comes up nice and
high around your neck and again it kind
of has like the cutout shoulders here
and it has like a tie in the front and
you can tighten it or loosen it I guess
like you would with a tie I was kind of
a pointless thing to tell you guys and
it cinches right around your waist area
and then it just goes down into a normal
maxi dress and it does have a slit
coming up the one side which I kind of
find flattering with maxi dresses and
also just more comfortable when it comes
to maxi dresses so this is the little
red maxi dress that I got the next thing
that I picked up was this little dress
here and I just loved the print of it
and like the style of fit was so again
like you guys already know I love the
like higher neck kind of style dresses
so it kind of buttons up around your
neck and has the cutout shoulders and
then it's just this really nice white
blue and like aqua floral pattern and it
has like the fit-and-flare style open
back area which will be very difficult
for me to find a bra to wear with this
but that is the dress that I picked up
then the next maxi that I picked up was
one that was in the sales section and
this is what it looks like here it's
just like white and it has a and has a
white insert underneath it might be hard
for you guys to see but it's white lace
with a white insert on the inside and it
ties up in the back and then the insert
stops right about just mid thigh and the
rest just stays lace so you'll be able
to kind of like see through the bottom
to the words like your legs but the rest
of your self is covered obviously and it
was on sale I believe for like fourteen
or fifteen dollars I also picked up some
shoes from the Charlotte Russe website
so the first pair picked up or these
ones here and they're just like standard
black gladiator sandals a
I needed a nice pair of black sandals to
the summer because I can't seem to find
any of my gladiators this year I don't
know what happened when I moved but
everything suddenly disappeared so these
are what they look like they're just
like a standard like small or ankle
style sandal and I just thought think
these are nicer to wear with like maxi
dresses or skirts and stuff when you're
looking a little bit dressier than if
you just don't want to wear flip-flops
so those are these sandals that I picked
up and then another pair of shoes that I
picked up for these wedges here and I
don't have like a nice pair of like
brown faux leather wedges this is what
they look like they just kind of have
like the wood style wedge and then like
a faux leather brown on top and they
lace up around the top and then they
have just a little gold buckle they're
just like nice for the summertime for
wearing with a summer dress or a maxi
dress so next I pick up this little
black romper here and I picked this up
specifically it to wear for a date night
but haven't had the chance to yet so
when I'm around I get around to having a
chance to go on a date night this is a
little romper that I picked up for it
and it's like a nice stretchy material
and it's black and it has a really low
cut in the front which I'm sure Ryan
will like and the criss-crossing
straps in the back with like a little
bit of like an open area on your back
here so this is the little black romper
that I picked up and then of course the
bottom is short so as you guys already
know I'm obsessed with two pieces so the
two piece that I picked up from
Charlotte Russe is this one here
probably my new favorite the bottom is
just like a flare style skirt and it's
got like the white red and blue tribal
prints all over it which I find so nice
and I just really really loved the like
print and style of this and the top as
I'm sure you guys will not be surprised
is the one that kind of goes tight
around your neck and then a little loose
everywhere else it's got just this
strappy detailing in the back here so
that is the little two-piece that I
picked up from shellers and then the
last article clothing I have to show you
guys is this one here the tighter style
skirts and they're totally coming back
in so I picked up one and I just picked
this print here so I thought it was like
oh no it's kind of funky and I know
couple tops already that I have that I
could wear with this it's like a longer
tighter style skirt but it feels like a
material that's not too tight that it
would be unflattering so this is the
little pencil skirt that I picked up and
then last but not least I picked up two
body chains and if you guys don't know
what body chains are which I'm sure most
of you guys probably do by now they're
just um chains that kind of come around
you and then go around to the back and
they're nice just for the summertime
with like certain outfits or if you're
going to like the beach or something and
don't plan on swimming I guess you could
wear like little body change so I picked
up two different little gold wines I
pull them out but honestly you guys
probably won't be able to see the detail
and too much but they will be in videos
very soon so hold tight because you guys
will see them so that is everything that
I have to show you guys for my haul
today always everything you guys saw in
this video is probably going to be an
upcoming blog posts videos or just even
on Instagram post so you will see what
it all looks like on I'll leave all the
links down below on my blog so go check
that out so other than that that is my
