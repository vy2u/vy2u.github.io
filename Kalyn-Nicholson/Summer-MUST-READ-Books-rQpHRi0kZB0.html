trust you everybody
hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so about a new allocation today just
because I want to start giving my
background I want to give up my videos
especially going to summer a little bit
more diversity when I'm sitting down and
talking to you guys and also because I
hung up my good old glorious James Dean
skeleton who's being half cut off in the
frame right now but I don't know I just
like I like the thought of him watching
down over us as we film my summer
reading list because that is what this
video is all about if you guys are newer
to my channels and you might not know
this but I filmed this video last year
in the year before I'll link them down
below or somewhere up on the screen
recently fell off of the whole like
reading bandwagon for a while there I
got super busy and was traveling and
just all the different projects that
I've been working on reading kind of one
on the back burner for a bit until I
picked some Red Queen and then I I
blazed through that pretty quickly
finished that book on my Garrett trip
and then all of a sudden I'm addicted to
it again like I just want to read all
the time all over again so I made myself
a reading list this time I was realistic
about it and I made myself six books
which is two bucks a month and yeah
let's let's jump into it shall we
so I picked out six books that I want to
read this summer I'm going to give you
guys some brief descriptions about them
they are all pretty pretty different and
I'm also going to leave the links to
them down below so definitely check that
out one of the first ones that I want to
read and it's probably going to be the
one that I start reading tonight is girl
boss
the other day I came back from where was
I my hometown I believe it was really
late I joke home really late and I had
like an hour before I wanted to go to
bed I was in one of those movies where I
wanted to watch something new so I threw
girlboss on on Netflix and honestly I
threw it on because so many of you guys
have tweeted me being like you need to
watch it you need watch it it's safe to
say that I was instantly obsessed and
I've already finished the whole season
all the OSI references and like the 2006
like early 2000 references and oh my god
it is just the most glorious show and so
it inspired me to pick up the book that
the whole series is based off of girl
Hoss is actually like a really loose
story like a loose a loosely truth story
about the girl that created Nasty Gal
like the clothing line and so I picked
up the books I really want to read the
book as well and just to tide me over
until the second season a girl boss
comes out which I don't even know
confirmed but I'm confirming it because
if they don't create a second season
I might not I might not be alright with
that I'll read you guys like the blurb
about the book the first thing Sophia
Amoruso sold online wasn't fashion it
was a stolen book she spends her teens
hitchhiking committing petty thefts and
dumpster diving by 22 she had resigned
herself to employment but was still
broke directionless and working a
mediocre day job that she had taken for
health insurance it was their thoughtful
tu decided to start selling vintage
clothes on eBay eight years later she's
the founder CEO and creative director of
Nasty Gal plus 100 million dollar online
fashion retailer was more than 350
employees so he has never been a typical
CEO or a simple to anything and she's a
written girlboss for outsiders and
insiders seeking the unique path to
success even with that path is that
winding as all hell and lined with
naysayers girl loss includes Sophia
story yet it's infinitely better than
Sophia it's deeply personal and yet
Universal Phil this brazen wake-up call
cutting Frank's observations and
behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty Gal
meteoric rise it proves that being
successful isn't about how popular you
were in high school or where you went to
college if you went to college rather
success is about trusting your instincts
following your gut and knowing rules to
follow and rich rules to break expecting
to be more obsessive the book because I
always tend to like books more than
movies and shows anyways I am a book
snob that way so yeah that is number one
on my summer reading list the second
book on my summer reading list is called
as a problem with forever
it is by Jennifer L Armentrout I
probably butchered that name I will read
again the inside blurb so that this
video isn't like ridiculously long with
me just jabbering about things that are
unlike unreal 'van just like I am doing
right now at the second for some people
silence is a weapon for Malory boost
dodge is a shield
growing up she wanted the best way to
survive was to say nothing and even
though it's been four years since her
nightmare ended she's beginning to worry
that the fear that holds her back will
last a lifetime now after years of
homeschooling with loving adoptive
parents Malory must face a new milestone
spending her senior year at public high
school but of all the terrifying and
exhilarating scenarios she's Madden's
there's one she's never dreamed of that
she'd run into Ryder start the friend
and protector she hasn't seen since
childhood on her
very first day it doesn't take long for
Mallory realized that the connection she
shared his Ryder never really seeded yet
his deeper their bond grows the more it
becomes apparent that she's not the only
one grappling with lingering scars from
the past and actually watches Ryder's
lifespan I was control Valerie must make
a choice between staying silent and
speaking out for the people she loves
the life she wants and the truth that
needs to be heard so I mean this book is
definitely like it sounds like it's
about deep or personal things going on
in your life but I kind of like books
like that
I'm super geeky over teen fiction novels
like the book I wrote is pretty much a
teen fiction novel so this is totally my
wheelhouse
I try not to look at the reviews but it
did have pretty good stars on Amazon
Prime which I discovered recently I am
such a judge a book by its cover kind of
gal and then it just screen it looks
like summer you know what I mean it's
colorful I feel like it should smell
like coconut yeah so that's the second
book that's on my reading list and third
as I mentioned I recently read read
clean and I finished it when I was on
the plane over to Scotland and it's so
funny because I didn't get a chance to
read this on the trip but I actually
brought this with me on the trip in
Atlanta brought the exacting book and we
did not know we were even reading the
same series so it was really funny this
is just blackboard this is the second
book to red queen red queen is really
good I find it's a bit of a combination
of like the selection series and like
Hunger Games a little bit I prefer the
selection series I could further be
author that wrote the selection series I
prefer her form of writing that says
though like once I start a series I have
to finish it all so just you kind of
want to know what's going to happen like
I need to know what goes on with the
characters I get so intertwined with
like what happens next or who ends up
with you or like what if I really
connect with a character like where
their personal growth ends up going and
so it can be a little choppy and a
little all over the place but I just
really love the characters in this book
and then this series so I picked up the
second one it's about how like there is
kind of a divide in the world where
people have silver blood or people have
red blood and if your red blood your
life considered kind of like the
peasants and if you have silver blood
you're considered more royalty so
definitely check out the Red Queen if
you haven't already it is the second one
to that and it's
must summer English which I feel like I
should probably stop saying you probably
know that by now so the next book on my
summer reading list is called leave your
mark it is by ELISA Lynch
so once the cover pretty freakin cute is
this one's not like a fiction this one
is more like a motivational book
obsessed with my motivational books like
you are about asked the settler until
this so I didn't leave your mark is
about landing your dream job killing it
in your career and rocking social media
yeah I know I'm a huge nerd that's okay
I embrace it I love this kind of crap
give you guys a little bit of an insight
to what it's about leave your mark isn't
an advice book it's a mentorship in 288
pages ELISA is the social media
superstar she's the voice behind the
wildly popular DKNY PR girl Twitter feed

particular emphasis on communicating and
building your personal brand ELISA is
your sassy knowledgeable guide to
contemporary working world where
personal and professional lines are
blurred and the most important thing you
can have is a strong sense of self this
is a good one to pick up if you guys are
wanting to like become youtubers or work
in social media or anything like that or
if you already are I'm already more to
doing this stuff but I love learning
more about it I love hearing like other
people's perspectives of it I'm a bit of
an introvert and I love the friendships
that I have where we get to talk about
this kind of stuff but that's not every
single French or every single
relationship that I have in my life so
reading these types of books especially
about the types of things that I'm kind
of working in or about social media
about all the things that I get super
geeky and super nerdy over is so fun
because it's beneficial it's helpful and
I'm allowed to like you go over it
without boring the crap out of anyone I
just love reading about like it's kind
of like with girlboss where I love
reading books to those girls in the
world that are just playing the game you
know I mean killing it and then writing
books to tell other people how to kill
it
I just think that that's awesome
freaking girl power let's move on my
next one on my list and I'm pretty sure
it's so funny I think this may have been
on my one of my last summer reading
lists or maybe even my fall one but I
never got around to reading it and it is
the to all the boys I've loved before by
Jenny Han total geeky like thirteen year
old girl teen fiction so up my alley
though and if you guys are wondering
notice about it says when I write I hold
nothing back I write like she'll never
read it because he never will every
secret thought every careful observation
everything I've saved up inside me I put
it all in a letter and when I'm done I
feel it I adjust it and then I put it in
my teal hat box oh my god I'm so lame
they're not love letters in the
strictest sense of the word my letters
are for one I don't want to be in love
anymore there's a goodbye because after
I writes a letter I'm no longer consumed
by my all-consuming love I can eat my
cereal and not wonder if you like
bananas over his Cheerios - I couldn't
sing alongs a lot of songs and not be
singing them to him if love is my
possession maybe my letters are like the
exorcisms god I love that my letters set
me free or at least they are supposed to
and basically what like I'm not ruining
it it says it on the inside but there's
a day that all of her secret love
letters get mailed I don't know how she
is fallen in love with so many people in
her short young life but it sounds
really cool there's a sappy love
obsessed little teens still inside of me
and so that is why I love reading these
kinds of books this is like the lightest
read this is one of those ones that I
don't have to be like super consumed by
so when when this summer things ever get
really really busy or I'm traveling a
lot and I just want something to bring
with me to like kind of read lightly
this will be my gal you know and as for
book number six I've read this book
before I've talked about it on my
channel before but not for a while I
want to reread The Four Agreements this
is a book that I read when I went to
Dominican like two years ago just over
two years ago I loved everything I
talked about I loved hearing about like
the Toltec path and like all of those
types of things it's a little bit
different than my usual like
motivational like girl boss kind of
books but this one is more about you
like your spirituality and and how like
the universe is about it's a little bit
more
it's a little bit more hippie if it's by
Don Miguel Ruth and the Four Agreements
themselves are like be impeccable with
your words don't take anything
personally don't make assumptions and
always do your best and it goes into
depth about those four agreements and
how like abiding by those four
agreements can change your life and make
you like a more like syllabus more light
and more love it's a little different
than everything else in my reading list
and I have read it before but it's so
not fresh in my memory anymore and I
just remember when I finished reading
this it was like something shifted in me
and I felt so connected to the world and
I'm kind of lacking in that a little bit
lately I feel like I'm very in touch
with a lot of things going on in my life
but something that I want to get back
into is feeling a little bit more in
touch with my spiritual side I've lost a
little bit of that in the last year I
would say as much as I loved my like you
know own it kill it go after it kind of
side I also love my peaceful like
spiritual side and I want to nourish
that a little bit more as lame as that
sound that is why this is the sixth book
on my reading list for the summer this
whole video is pretty much me openly
admitting how geeky I am okay embrace
your weird you know so that concludes
that my summer reading like those are
the six books that I have so far if I
end up updating them you guys will know

reading a new book which I plan on doing
tonight because girlboss is going to be
the first one that I begin with let me

lately or what books you might have on
your summer reading list because I'm
always adding like want to read to my
