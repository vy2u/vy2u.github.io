was we were cold so I'm usually woken up
in the morning just like this from
Bentley attacking my face cuz my alarms
gone off and woken him up so he wants me
to get up and I try and stretch it out a
little bit before getting out of bed and
making my bed which is a routine that I
try not to get rid of because it helps
me feel a little bit more clean and just
organized I guess for the day I don't
know I just don't like coming into my
room and seeing an unmade bed I guess it
just makes my bed look more clean than
today
we wait for you
then after I make my bed I head into my
closet and just change into some pants
and it's usually I have to take that me
out right away in the morning and I
throw in some slippers because it's
usually pretty chilly in our apartment
in the morning
so I grabbed Bentley's leash and I take
him on a little mini walk outside so
that he can go to the washroom
and yeah between the trees
so once we're back inside first things
first is slippers and then of course
what is morning without my coffee so I
make my coffee right away and I just put
a little bit of almond milk and stevia
in it
well for you
and then I carry my coffee back upstairs
and I like to hang out in my little
window seat or window bench and just
kind of creep up on my iPad and just
search what everybody's up to on social
media and just kind of catch up on
whatever happens the next four
to
I then usually just head into my office
and I will open up my computer and play
some music and then just check on my
channels or maybe upload or work on a
video and definitely answer some emails
I then usually grab my agenda open it up
and see what's in store for the day or
I'll add some extra things and I need to
do that day or throughout the week I
just kind of touch up on my agenda and
get checking on what I'm supposed to be
doing that day and then I bring my
coffee cup back downstairs and wash it
since usually by this point I'm finished
with my coffee
I'm dreaming one away
this is and then by this time I usually
make breakfast since I can't eat right
away in the morning since it gives me an
upset stomach so I'll usually make some
oatmeal or toast or a big big smoothie
but today I decided to go with toast
since we needed to do some groceries so
we didn't have very many options so I
just put a little bit of vegan butter
some tomato and onion and then sprinkled
pepper on top I know that sounds weird
but it's actually super delicious and
I'm someone that likes a lot of savory
food I'm not a big sweet person so this
is like my ideal breakfast and then I
throw on our stereo which is usually on
country and just kind of jam out while I
eat my breakfast and have a big glass of
water
and then once I'm done I'll usually just
do those dishes right away so they don't
sit in the sink and then I head over to
the bathroom and start brushing my teeth
we waiting I feel like there's a big
divide in people that brush their teeth
first thing in the morning or do it
right after they eat breakfast so
comment below which one you are
and then I'll usually just use a makeup
wipe to wash off my face from whatever's
there because I wash my face pretty
thoroughly the night before so I just
use a quick makeup wipe and I'm using my
Olay fresh effects since they have
little exfoliating beads on them so I
find it helps make me feel nice and
fresh and have a slick face for some
makeup so then I go upstairs and usually
head into my closet and pick out what
I'm gonna be wearing that day and then I
head back into my office and this is
also where I do my makeup in my hair so
then I'll usually just put on a little
bit of makeup especially if it's a day
that I'm not filming I like to keep it
with just some foundation and I'm using
my covergirl stay luminous this is my
new favorite because it's nice and light
but it gives a good coverage and it just
makes my face look nice and radiant for
the summer and then I'll just put a bit
of pressed powder over top of that I'll
fill in my brows a little bit and then
just a little bit of mascara I like to
keep my makeup nice and light when I'm
not filming or anything just because
it's so much easier and I don't like to
get used to wearing too much makeup
every single day and since I was
planning on heading to the gym this day
I decided to just use my Pantene blowout
extend dry shampoo which has been my new
favorite dry shampoo of mine because it
just adds a little bit more volume and
takes away any of the excess oil or
anything in my hair that way I can just
shower up with the gym
so then I headed to the office store
just a few doors down and my project for
today was just to get something for the
wall above my computer in my office so I
decided to do this really easy little
DIY project I just picked up some frames
and a little clock and some smaller
frames from a dollar store and I found
these little pictures online and I can
link them down below and I'm just
cutting them out and just putting them
in different orders all over my wall
above my computer I was just kind of
feeling like I needed a little project
for the day so that was my project since
I'd just recently moved in I wanted to
find some really cool wall art to do
above my office so this is really really
easy and I'll leave the links to these
pictures down below for you guys so I
hope you guys enjoy my morning routine
and I'll see you guys all in a future
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
