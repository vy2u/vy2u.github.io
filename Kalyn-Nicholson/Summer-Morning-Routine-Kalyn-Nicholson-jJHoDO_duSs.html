most recent morning routine I would say
this would be my morning routine for the
summer or ever since I moved into this
apartment and it normally starts out
with me turning on Spotify and blaring
it through my whole apartment I'll put
on country or whatever playlist I'm
feeling and then make myself a good old
cup of coffee
you
so with my coffee I normally like to
chug a full water bottle of either lemon
water or just cold water from the fridge
but my water bottle was missing this day
that I filmed this so I couldn't find it
but then I will go sit on the couch hang
out with Bentley and then take him
outside and it's nice because I'm on the
bottom floor of my building so I can
literally just hook him up outside and
he can go out and hang out there as long
as he likes and then I will normally
start drinking my coffee and creep
through my film
and because benleah is such a chubby low
monkey he knows his routine well enough
to know that when he comes back inside
he gets his food so I will pour him his
bowl of food and make sure that his
water bowl is full and then this is
normally the time that I'll kind of sit
back down and either make a second
coffee if I'm feeling it that day or
drink some more water and kind of just
hang out on my laptop
I'll answer emails I will respond to
like YouTube comments or come up with
video ideas or surf We Heart It and I
like to get up relatively early so I
have a good chunk of time to do this in
the morning because morning is like my
favorite time of day and I like to have
like my veg time
so after a good chunk of time has passed
I will normally then make my breakfast
I'm somebody that if I eat right when I
get up it kind of tends to make me feel
a little nauseous but I still like to
eat within the hour of waking up and
this could be smoothies oatmeal it
really changes depending on what I'm
feeling that day I have these like
little cinnamon organic cereals and I
made that with banana cut-up bananas and
almond milk but again my breakfast
differs every day sometimes I'll make
banana ice cream and then sometimes I'll
FaceTime my friends or I'll just
continue to creep on my phone or listen
to music whatever I'm really just
feeling that day this kind of differs
every single morning and ever since the
weather has been getting nicer I have
been enjoying kind of doing my workouts
in the morning as opposed to later at
night or I'll go for like a hike with my
friend and so this is what I normally
end up doing at this point of the day
even if it's just taking Bentley for a
quick walk or going for a hike with my
friend or sometimes I'll do my workout
or my run so I will normally switch into
some workout gear head out and go do
something active even if it's just like
a quick walk around the block but for
this day I decided to go for a run so I
went and ran my 5k and then came back
yes a fee your skin
your skin on my wife in your skin your
skin
and then of course I will hop in the
shower and use my little like phone
thingy so that I can blare music and
spend way too much time like singing and
dancing and then I go into like my
closet room I normally light a candle
especially if I'm going to be doing my
makeup and then I will blow dry my hair
if I shower and I need to do something
that day or if I don't I will let it air
dry this day i blow-dried my hair I turn
on some music from my phone and then I
just go ahead and do my makeup and this
kind of differs everyday and for those
of you that are like wow why didn't you
do a tutorial there is one coming don't
worry that's why I didn't do it for this
video or else it would have been super
long and then I will then again just go
ahead and do my hair and this day I was
curling it whoa fee your skin
your skin oh my yes of in your skin and
then last but not least and my favorite
part of the day is I will pick out what
I'm wearing depending on what I'm doing
that day if I'm filming or if I'm
heading out to meet some friends or
whatever it is so I will normally switch
into my outfit and then that's pretty
much it so I hope you guys enjoyed my
morning routine and I will see you guys
on my next video bye guys
let me know that I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
