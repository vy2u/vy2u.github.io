to be doing a summer party sort of look
this is definitely a heavier look than I
usually do but I find makeup really fun
and I like to play around and try out
anything if you're looking for a fun
versatile I look to do with pretty much
any lip color or if you're just looking
to recreate this whole makeup look in
general then just keep watching so I'm
starting out by priming my skin to make
sure that the makeup stays on all night
and I'm going to list all the products
that I'm using down below and then I'm
going in with my covergirl outlast stay
luminous foundation this has been a new
favorite of mine because it gives the
perfect amount of coverage without going
to cakey and I just love the luminescent
look it gives especially for the
summertime so then I'm going in with my
NYX concealer and I'm just putting this
under my dark circles on top of my dark
circles on my eyelid at the bridge of my
nose and just anywhere I want to
highlight and then I'm using a damp
Beauty Blender to just blend it all into
place and pick up any excess that I
don't need and then I'm just setting
everything in place with a translucent
powder
to be the one with
for my brows I'm just going in with this
Annabelle brow pencil in a light blonde
color
so tragic
and then I'm just going in with a matte
bronzer that I plan on using on my face
later and just putting a little bit on a
fluffy brush and blending this into my
crease as my first color to help
everything else then I'm going to be
doing on my eyes blend a little bit more
seamlessly and it was just the perfect
matte color that I was looking for said
sailing like a character in a book for
eyes I'm just going in with this makeup
forever palette and I'm taking a small
pencil brush and taking a little bit of
that this black here and just putting
this on the outer V of my eye and then
I'm going to go in and blend it all in
with a big fluffy brush
I'm then just taking this golden
champagne color on a damp makeup brush
and then putting this all over the lid
using a damp brush is going to make the
metallic a little bit more bright and
then I'm just taking the one next to it
with just which is just a little bit of
a lighter champagne and using this as a
highlight in my inner tear-duct as well
as under my brow bone then on a pencil
brush I'm taking this metallic bronze
color and I'm just popping this on my
lower lash line just on the outer third
of my eye and then to complete the look
I'm just going in with some gel liner
and I'm just lining my eyes I usually
don't pull on my eye when doing eyeliner
but I was going for a really thin crisp
line this time so I suggest trying not
to pull on the eye but I'm just working
on getting better at it and then I'm
winging it out just a little bit and
filling it all in and then I'm going in
with my covergirl super sizer mascara
and just putting on a couple coats
before some falsies
gross that is
to come through my face I'm just using a
matte bronzer since there's a lot of
shimmer going on on the eyes and I'm
just taking a really giant fluffy brush
and blending this into the contours of
my cheeks as well as around my hairline
and my jaw line and then just taking a
smaller brush and contouring my nose and
then for blush I'm just taking a more
peachy pink for the summertime and
popping this on the apples of my cheeks
and then falsies are obviously optional
but since this is more of like a summer
party look I decided to get some flared
and full lashes you got the shoes in
hassle time and this eye look you could
pretty much wear with any pop of color
on your lips or you could go with nude
but I decided to go with a bubblegum
pink just because I thought it was
really summery and a nice bright color
for the summer so I'm just going in with
my covergirl lipstick in enchantress
blush and then that is the color that I
did on my lips so as for my hair I'm
just taking it out of the bun that was
in my head and adding in my extensions
and then I'm just using about a one to
two inch curling wand and curling my
hair away from my face with the
extensions in
so grab somebody dosage Oh laughs a
dance or don't you know
once then just take a chunk from the
thicker side of your hair if you're
wearing a side part and then just create
a braid and braid it all the way down to
you reach the end of the chunk and then
what we're going to do is while holding
it with your hand at the bottom you're
going to want to pull pieces out to make
it look more full and voluminous once
done just go ahead and secure it into
place and then we're going to pull all
of our hair up into a ponytail and then
just add the braid once it's in the
ponytail just play around with the hair
till you get how it looks and that's all
you have to do for this little party
ponytail and it's perfect cuz it gets it
off your face as for the outfit you can
find this top from the lookbook store
and I'll leave all the rest of the
details down below I hope you guys
enjoyed this party video and I'll see
you guys all in a future video bye guys
