primer and putting this all over my face
to make sure that my makeup lasts all
night and keeps my skin from being oily
and then as for foundation I'm using the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi by the way guys
I'll leave all the products down below
listed in the description bar for you
guys so since I used the primer I first
pressed the foundation into my skin and
then blended it then next I'm going to
be using a concealer from covergirl and
just highlighting my face as well as
concealing my dark circles then I'm just
using in the NYC at loose powder to just
set everything I just did into place and
then moving on I'm going to start with
eyebrows so I'm using my brow bar to go
by white and lightening and just using a
little brush that came with it just
filling in my brows and then using the
gel to put it in place and then I'm
going into my Naked basics and I'm using
the color Naked 2 and just using a
blending brush and pushing this into my
crease to make sure that the color that
we're going to use next goes on nice and
smooth and blends nicely and then
spraying my brush with my matte fix
press spray to make sure that this color
Pepsi coral from L'Oreal available goes
on nice and primitive and very very
bright and then I'm just taking mary-lou
manizer and using this as a highlight in
my inner tear duct and just patting it
on a little bit into the color to just
to blend it in nicely then I'm going to
take some blue eyeliner and just line my
bottom lash line and this
going to be our pop of color with the
coral the blue in color the blue and the
coral go together so nicely then next
I'm just going to line my lot eyes with
a liquid eyeliner as I normally do after
curling my lashes I'm taking L'Oreal
telescopic and just spending a light
coat on my top lash line since I'm going
to be using false lashes you don't have
to use false lashes but I decided if it
was going to be a party look you go big
or you go home so I'm just using these
spidery lashes that I got from a
four-piece set from ELF and then of
course I'm going to do the same thing to
my bottom lashes but just with the
mascara then moving forward I'm going to
be putting on soft nude in color zero
seven zero from the revlon colorburst
lipsticks and then using coral craze by
color your smile and putting that right
on top and then as for contouring my
face I'm using Rimmel's natural bronzer
because it doesn't have too much shimmer
so I didn't want to take away from the
eye look since it's nice and shimmery
and I'm just contouring my cheekbones
underneath my chin and my hairline
then sticking with the coral theme I'm
using sunset glow by Annabelle as my
blush and then highlighting my face with
whitening Lightning's BB + illumination
and blending it in with my ring finger
so that is all there is for this makeup
look it's super simple but still very
summery and has lots of pops of color so
let's move on to the outfit the dress
that I'm going to be wearing is a
bandage dress from dollhouse so this
company basically just makes celebrity
in style inspired bandage dresses but
it's really really good quality so I
chose this blue one it's super super
pretty and I thought it was perfect for
the summertime and so I went ahead and
put this on and then my wedges are from
shoe dazzle so I'll leave links to both
of those down below too so this dress is
really really good quality and I thought
it went really well with the pop of blue
underneath the eyes so that is it for my
makeup perfect outfit and cute shoes for
a summer party let me know down below so
you guys enjoyed this and want more
looks like this and I will see you guys
all in the future video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
