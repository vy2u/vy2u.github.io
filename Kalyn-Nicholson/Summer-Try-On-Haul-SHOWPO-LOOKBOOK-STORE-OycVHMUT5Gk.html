to be sharing with you guys a summer
clothing haul and yes I am going to make
sure it is a Tryon clothing haul
normally I don't because I like to put
them in like look books and blog posts
and all of that fun stuff but you know
what I gotta give the people what they
want you know okay so first we will
start with show PO I have a few things
from show PO that I recently received
the first thing that I picked out was
this place ooh it's in like a baby blue
which I think looks so nice with like a
tan or just for the summertime I don't
know I'm really diggin this color so
it's actually an off-the-shoulder so it
goes like this
and this is what it looks like it's kind
of got flared sleeves as well I will do
a cutaway clip here of what it looks
like on and then it's got it singed in
the middle and it's got pockets as well
as this little tie up that you can like
make a little bow with and I just think
this is so cute I really really like the
material and play suit slash jumpers
like this are so easy to just throw on
when you're going up for lunch I
absolutely love jumpers for that reason
and this color is killer okay so the
next thing I picked up was this crop top
here it's in like a grayish
almost like off-white purple color I
don't even know how to explain that that
probably made no sense it comes up right
tight around your neck and then it's
just got like a slit down the middle and
then the back ties up and the cute thing
about this little crop top is in the
back here it's got like crochet for the
strap so that tie up in the back so it's
really really cute again this is a
really nice color for like if you have a
little bit of a TIA I feel like this is
going to be like a nice top that you
could wear to like the date night or
you're going to something a little bit
more fancy but it is kind of like a
chiffon material so yeah that is the
cute crop that I picked up I've been
really digging jeans lately with like
the tore up front cover like I don't
know and I picked up this pair of
high-waisted well they're kind of
high-waisted I don't know I would guess
they're not really low waist or high
waist or like right in the middle if
that helps um from show PO they are
these light wash jeans they're kind of
like a boyfriend fit I guess you could
say and they are completely tore up and
distressed all over the front and I love
it because the leg that has the most
like tears in it that's where my leg
tattoo is so it kind of gets
peak out which i think is just I'm not
little things like that made me so happy
and then the back is pretty standard
they've got rips on the pockets but no
rips going down the back there's so many
outfits I have in mind for these pants
so you guys will see I also picked up
this killer romper or play suit I don't
know this one's hard to say because it
is technically long so it is in this
like dusty rosy brown type color like
taupe and it's pretty little cut in the
front and the sleeves kind of go up like
a blouse would but we're like a nice top
like a button up top like that's kind of
what the sleeves are like and then there
are shorts let me see if I can show you
you know what I'll just do the cutaway
clip so that it makes way more sense
so there's shorts in the front here but
then the back of the romper has like
this really long cape that kind of
drapes out on either side of you so I
think this is freaking adorable I was
obsessed with this the minute I saw it
on the site so you guys are definitely
going to see this rocked either in a
blog post or a video or possibly both
but this is just like the coolest the
coolest thing in my freaking closet I'm
obsessed with it so the next thing that
I picked up from Shope are these jeans
here so these are not even really jeans
they're more like jeggings
a hundred percent they are the comfiest
pants I own and not only are they so
comfy but they're also so freakin
flattering so these are definitely
high-waisted which is perfect for
wearing crops in the summer and you know
what's going on at nighttime we're going
out for like a date or going up for
dinner with your girls or anything like
that and they are like this dark blue
wash and the material is so stretchy and
comfy so you can eat all the food you
want you can have as much beer as you
want and it will not blow you well
actually that's a lie it will blow you
but your pants will stretch with you in
terms of pants I just feel like that's
friendship goals you know like pants
that stretch with you stay with you so
the next room Shoko I just have this
gray bodysuit so it's kind of like
really low-cut in the front but I
tighten the straps as tight as I can go
so that it kind of holds the girls in I
like it because the body suit portion of
it keeps it from kind of opening up in
the front or you know like letting your
girls out or anything like that and the
material is super comfy super stretchy
and
so really really flattering bodysuit if
you can get it to like if you can
tighten the straps and adjust it to your
liking or like to your body shape but
I'm really really addicted to this and
this looked really really cute with like
the ripped up boyfriend jeans that I
just showed you guys so that is the
little bodysuit that I also picked up so
that was everything I had to show you
guys from show PO so let's move in to
the lookbook store I have a few items
from there for the summer that I'm so
excited to show you guys so let's jump
in I'm like obsessed with the cuff
sleeves on this so this is what it looks
like just a white romper with like
crochet detailing all around the top and
the trim and then it's got like little
cuffs for your arms so it's got like
cutout shoulders so flippin cute and
then it kind of cinches around your
waist and then the bottom has this like
Flair chiffon I don't know I just think
it's really really cute and there's so
many different ways you could like rock
this if you like it's super boho so I'd
probably wear it with like fringe
booties and like a cute hat or something
like that but like I said you guys will
totally see that either in a photo or a
video so stay tuned because it's coming
and if you guys remember from last year
what is a summer with me and without two
pieces I'm like addicted to two pieces
so I picked up this little two piece
from the lookbook store I am in love
with the material so it's kind of like
this I don't even know like business
casual kind of material I don't know how
to explain this but it's got like a salt
and pepper kind of look to it
I do have to get the shorts fitted
because they are they don't really fit
me like the kind of they're all either a
little bit too long or maybe I have to
get them taken in around the waist so
that I can wear them a little bit higher
they are so cute and their flared oh and
then that goes with the matching top
which is like a t-shirt style so this is
the top it's like a cute little t-shirt
style and paired together they are
adorable I love the color of these and
again I just feel like there's so many
different ways I could rock this outfit
every now and then I do see like
pictures of like Kendall and Kylie all
the time like all over we heard it and
stuff like that and this one time I saw
a picture of Kylie and she was running
this really killer red dress it looks so
good on her and so when I was on the
lookbook store I noticed that they had a
dress that was very very similar to it
so I picked it up
course and I just feel like again it's
so important to have a nice red a red
number just sitting in your closet ready
to be taken out ready to feel hot in so
this is the red dress that I picked up
the material this is insane it is such
nice material I was actually very very
impressed with it it's like a stretchy
tighter kind of material it like curves
in at your waist and then the bottom has
like scooped if that makes any sense it
like kind of scoops down in the front
and in the back which i think is super
flattering for like hips and legs and I
don't know and the color of this is just
absolutely perfect just need to find an
excuse to wear it and next from the
lookbook store I picked up this romper
it's kind of it like a khaki color or
material like a tan beige so again this
is an off-the-shoulder Robert kind of
sits like this and it is just again like
kind of it's not really khaki material
but it kind of feels a little bit close
to it and then it cinches in the waist
and it's got this really nice white rope
like tie up so that you can tighten it
and it's again just a pretty simple play
suit Robert thing but I am addicted to
these for throwing on and just running
out of the house and anything that I
don't have to wear a bra with is a
friend of mine you know what it means
and the last thing I have to show you
guys from the lookbook store is this
t-shirt dress if you guys can't tell I I
don't mean to do it but I always buy
like everything in grey or in black so I
picked up this t-shirt dress it won't
look that great on camera but I'll do a
cutaway clip here and show you guys what
it looks like it's just this like
massive t-shirt dress it's a really
really light material which I think will
be nice for the summer time and then it
comes with this little sash like tie up
thing so you can kind of adjust the
t-shirt to fit however you like it's
nice because it makes it a little bit
more versatile and it kind of play
around with it and get it to fit like
your body type nicely so I really really
enjoy this dress for that reason and
again you're gonna see it in an upcoming
video which I'm sure you guys are sick
of hearing me say lucky for you that was
the last thing I had to show you guys
let me know down below which item from
this little haul was your favorite and
other than that I will see all of you
guys in the future video bye guys
