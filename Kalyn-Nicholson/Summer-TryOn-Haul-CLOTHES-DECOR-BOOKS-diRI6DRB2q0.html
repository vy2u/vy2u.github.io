don't mind if I do I start not an
alcoholic
Lloris is coming to meet me in just a
bit but realistic someone gave us she
was so so sweet she gave me this bottle
of Rose a at my Meetup it's the
Woodbridge white sip until she said it
was her favorite can confirm holy crap
oh my god I love summer I love summer
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I am
filming and a new location I decided to
film in my bedroom today because one
I've been really digging the vibe in
here ever since I put up my new tapestry
which we will get to and show up some
lights
I switched bedrooms recently it got rid
of that massive closet thing that I've
had if you've been watching my channel
for a while you'll know how long that
closet has has been with us but I've
been really trying a keyword trying to
minimize my life and so with doing that
I decided slowly bit by bit I've been
getting rid of stuff hey buddy which is
super contradictive to this blog because
it's a haul video let me showing you
guys things I bought but every single
time that there's a shift in season I
tend to just like a little bit of a haul
move some things around and not only
that I feel like this year you know my
vibe is really shifted about a lot of
stuff for the shamah so the three main
little shopping sprees I did were books
home decor and clothing get real comfy
and let me share with you guys the haul
of the current aesthetic of my summer
because realistically at all it all kind
of fits the same aesthetic
first things first I picked up a couple
things one of the biggest ones is the
one behind my head right now I picked up
this son tapestry you guys can't really
tell what it's it's the son tarot card
someone commented recently that they
were getting sick of me talking about
Tarot I'll talk about it too much I know
that I've been really you know laying on
my spirituality side a bit more with you
guys I loved this when I saw it on Urban
Outfitters
sometimes when I'm super anxious or I'm
just going through a bit of a like more
stressful period of my life I feel it
the most when I sleep I will try and get
to bed and I try and get full night's
rest but one thing that I really enjoyed
or liked the idea of was hanging it
above my bed because in a way this is so
lame I look at it as like I'm charging
under the Sun when I sleep you know like
the Sun is protecting me the Sun card
and Tarot it's all about positivity and
good energy and feeling the like energy
of the Sun and so in a way I like to
look at it as like I'm recharging under
the Sun even though it's nighttime the
string lights around it are also from
Urban Outfitters I also picked up this
little planter over here I'll do a
little pan and zoom so that you guys can
get a closer look and in there is my
little plant derby one of the girls that
came from a meet-up all the way from
Jersey with her boyfriend gave me that
plant so I've popped it in there that is
three of the newer things that I bought
in terms of home decor but there's
there's there's more for me to show you
I also picked up a few things from
society6 which if you're curious pretty
much everything on my bed right now it's
also from society6 these three pillows
are from society6 but then this one's
from hmm so if you are looking at my
bedding and wondering where that's where
okay this is adorable the first thing is
this blanket and oh my lord this is so
soft
it's full of cactuses it's like white
with all these cute little cactuses on
it like can we just yes I love it
then I also got two tapestries so hear
me out
I initially was gonna put one of these
up above my bed but then I found that
Sun one at Urban Outfitters so I'm not
too sure what I'm gonna do with the
other one yet but again we're just
fitting the same theme I'm sure you're
not surprised at this is gonna be really
hard for me to show
but white with just like giant palm
leaves you know it just pan
does the one that I'm going to be
putting up in my living room which I
think will look really cute with a
little like cactus pillows and the
cactus blanket then I also picked up
this one and I might put it in my yoga
room and this one's just baby pink and
it's got some cacti the bottom I really
hope you guys can see this we'll find a
place for it I I have faith in us and so
that's the gist of the home decor I
recently purchased all plant related
except for the tarot deck decided to hit
up an indigo I bought a lot of books I
mean it if you guys are following me
since the beginning of this year you'll
know that one of the biggest goals I
have for this year was to really get
back into readings one of like my
favorite little moments in the morning
that I just like make my coffee and I
read chapter of both books all of the
books that I've been reading I like I'm
way ahead of schedule because I've just
been I've enjoyed it so much more
haven't hit a phase yet where I've been
out of it knock on wood I picked up a
few more this one here is called DIY
rules for a WTF world how to speak up
get creative and change the world by
Krista sooo this is what it looks like I
really liked that it was just like
empowering like self care versus self
hell it's not necessarily like the power
of now where my brain is gonna be shook
it it's gonna be like a good way just
kind of sharpen the perspectives that we
have in life and so that's why I like
books like this and I will leave a
review or let you guys know how I feel
about it
after I'm done when I started the whole
fiction nonfiction thing I like to pick
books that kind of go well together I'm
such a book by the cover type of person
when it comes to reading but this is
called love and other carnivores love
another connect turnip Big Love and
other carnivorous plants and this is by
Florence gon selves fans of Sarah Dessen
it's sharp powerful and woody and I am a
closet Sarah Dessen fan she's got some
good summer reads so I thought that this
would just be like a really cute book to
read for the summertime even looks like
summery I love me a good Eat Pray Love
but I also love me a good teen a good
tene fish and you feel me that's my
friend Kristen told me to pick up this
book so what I saw it I grabbed it and
it's called whiskey words and a shovel
I've been getting really
- poetry again and in fact I've actually
been collecting some of my poems I've
been getting really into poetry again I
feel like it's just so I'm so sappy you
know and I always try to find ways to
release that said sappiness without
feeling too immersed in the sticky SAP
so poems have been a huge thing for me
lately even the name of it is amazing so
again I've heard amazing things but
we'll keep you guys posted on what I
think let's just pick let's pick a
random poem and read it that was shall
we she is you and she was driven by all
things that caused her pain as what
failed to weaken her flames became fuel
yes
whiskey words and a shovel my friends
next thought five books okay don't judge
me I decided to pick up this book it's
called Paris for one so I just finished
reading the book called the measure of
my powers and it was about a girl and
she was like obsessive Paris and I went
to Paris I loved it when I saw this book
it's about a girl she's 26 and she's
never been to Paris she plans this like
romantic weekend getaway but her
boyfriend doesn't show up so she goes by
herself yeah girl yeah you did you don't
need no man to take you to Paris but
then it's also just about how she just
becomes like super independent and just
inspired by this trip she takes to Paris
by herself and plus like I said I pick
books that look nice together for
fictions and nonfiction I am that person
okay Alain one more book to show you
guys a hundred days happier so this is
just one that I saw on my way out of the
store and it totally caught me honestly
I'm not really one to grab one of these
like smaller pocket books that you can
just like throw in your purse but it was
again it's just one of those books that
I feel like is so good for just
sharpening your mind every day you can
just read one page a day and it's such
an easy little way to just like set your
perspective for the day especially on
days where you're not feeling as strong
or you're just like mentally like oh not
only that every single page also has a
quote and I'm all about the quotes 100
days happier it's by Dominique
Bertolucci or puta Leakey I don't know
just to give you guys an idea you're
supposed to kind of read one every
single day and the quote let's say for
let's just pick a random let's pick a
random one
to the quote for this one says
regardless of your upbringing or
formative experiences it's never too
late to start believing in yourself make
the decision today to believe in
yourself your dreams and your right to
achieve those dreams it doesn't matter
if this isn't how you felt yesterday or
if you don't have the confidence to know
that you will feel that way tomorrow
just begin each day with this thought in
your mind and watch yourself belief grow
you see what I mean once a day maybe was
like your morning coffee or whatever and
just kind of set that perspective also I
totally forgot about this but I also
picked up this little cloud from the
chapters so this is another part of the
home decor hate when things are triple-a
batteries come on we live in a EE world
but it kind of matches it even matter I
don't know I was gonna put this in my
office but not looking at it on in the
viewfinder kind of fits this room it was
only 15 bucks so okay now do the fun
stuff we got clothes to go through Rosen
break
one of the first things I picked up and
I'm kind of obsessed are these jean
shorts I've been seeing this trend
literally everywhere oversized giant
parachute jeans almost a once in forever
21 like if you look at the top there's
like an elastic band so I think they are
gonna be super comfy if they come with
the belt which I did not know when I
purchased I feel like they'll go with
like most things and they're super
high-waisted I bought these in a lighter
color too and then the next thing I
picked up in forever 21 is this little
crop here so I've been super into this
color lately it's kind of like a burnt
mustard or I guess ravish dark tan
orange many names for the color if you
like this is gonna look really cute even
with the shorts that I was just showing
you guys I've just been digging tops for
like they're not like but they just kind
of rest upon the ladies but hold them in
place you know this dress this is just
like a maxi that I got I've been really
digging dresses and maxi's this year I
keep it kind of natural not really wear
much makeup but throwing a maxi and you
look like you put in a lot of effort
this is just like the top portion of it
and it's got like a Wyatt
it's got like a pretty open back and
then this is the pattern of the material
I feel like this is gonna be super cute
for Arizona so next I decided to pick up
this little two-piece from forever 21
these are the shorts these are so cute
so adorable but also they're so comfy
like blue and white pattern so those are
the bottoms and this is the top which
again is so comfortable with bubble tops
and when you put them together it's like
the cutest little outfit ever
lately despite the fact that my hair and
makeup is done today because I'm filming
with you guys because after Lois that
comes over we're gonna head out so I
love outfits for the summer where if I
put it on it looks like I've put in a
lot of effort but I can leave my face in
my hair just doing its natural thing
because I've really been enjoying that
lately when you can rub your eye and
then realize that you didn't just mess
up your makeup best feeling in the world
all you need is a little bit of tinted
moisturizer and a little bit of mousse
and you're on your way okay so this is
pretty cool it's not really a maxi it's
more so of like a pantsuit I guess you
could say but it is a one-piece and then
the top is got this like t-shirt thing
going on again this is so comfy
forever21 has really been stepping
their game up I must say so the next in
forever21 I decided to pick up a bathing
suit it is this yellow striped bikini
and it's so cute the bottoms are
actually like high-waisted they're meant
to be highway said so the minute I read
that I was like yes and also yellow yes
next I have this top here that again I
feel like it's going to be such a closet
staple shirts like this are perfect
whether you're like going out a little
bit more professional or just like
meeting your girls for some sangria this
white top that you can throw on it bow
ties in the front and the material is
actually quite thick which is nice but
again you can wear these with those jean
shorts that I've shown you guys earlier
or you could wear these with like long
black pants and make it a little bit
more fancy have a lot of like cool chill
everyday comfy casual clothes especially
to like I'm not saying anything but if
I'm gonna start having to go on dates
again I'm gonna need something muscle
well a little nicer you know not that
I'm saying I'm going on dates because
realistically I'm not but when I do that
sure it's gonna come in handy here's the
jean shorts in the lighter color now you
know as I mentioned there's a true
aesthetic going on in this video
so this is a sports bra that I picked up
from forever 21 follow the palm leaves
all over it it's adorable
perfect for yoga and then the other
sports bra that I picked up from forever
21 is just this one it's just like a
plain white one but I liked that it was
high neck trying to branch out and go do
yoga outside more and when I do that I
don't want to be flashing my gals to the
whole world so I like that this one was
a little bit more high neck for a bit
more coverage so these are from forever
21 and they look so much like the pair
that you can get from a low yoga I love
a low yoga but they expensive when I saw
these on forever 21 I decided to grab
them I don't know if you guys can tell
but there's something like detailing on
the legs and seven all about the
matching sets when it comes to yoga cuz
you just you feel good you know
mind you I'm a big believer and I know
that haul videos haul videos are always
kind of weird because I feel like it's
like look at all this stuff I bought but
I like to keep in mind that you can do
yoga and anything you don't have to have
some matching set I've been loving the
shirts like this where there's built-in
sports bra but the actual material that
isn't sports bra goes longer so this is
gonna be good not only for just doing
yoga but I feel like this is one of
those tops I could throw on to just
chill
like easy summer day road trips
traveling things like that my knees
finally healed so I've been running
three to four times a week ago so four
days that it rains and I still want to
run I can wear this jacket comfy it's
cute and it's just like I don't know the
plain white I've been digging that vibe
for some reason it also totally forgot
I'm sorry to jump back a jean rrah of
this video but I picked up this book
from Amazon and it was at the bottom of
that box so I wanted to share it with
you guys finished reading the power of
now and it literally changed my life
Amazon knew that I was the type of
consumer that would totally fall for
this I was buying stuff for my Meetup
and for some reason it was showing me
books by Elkhart toll and I was like how
do you know me so well Amazon I'm a
little concerned it works because I
picked up a new book by Eckhart Tolle a
new truth awakening to your life's
purpose anything by Eckhart Tolle I'm
willing to read I book and I will keep
you posted but the power of now is so
good that I can't imagine anything him
writing it not just like completely
awakening my inner being okay we are
moving over to two small things to show
you from Urban Outfitters and brandy
Melville and then the rest is Lulu's the
other thing that I got from Urban
Outfitters are these pants again these
are so not like me but I love them and I
can't wait to figure out how I want to
style them you guys know the brunch
pants they're still there they're making
their way into the summer months and
these are the newest pair that I picked
up from Urban Outfitters my brunch pants
they read I thought black but apparently
navy blue so there's striped red and
navy blue big bow in the middle and the
material is so different so I just need
to figure out what top I want to rock
this with and then these are going to be
a new set of brunch pants that I rock
this summer Pat and I did some Queen
Street West shopping so I will show you
guys what I picked up from there a lot
of you guys were asking on my Instagram
where this top was from this is the
shirt here it's just got like an old
retro car on the front which is so sick
and then the back says Motor Show so
it's actually from brandy melville and
it comes cropped just like this so from
the Liz I'll start with some accessories
I picked up this hat it's just so cute
might not fit what I'm wearing I'll see
it even does so this is the Hat that I
picked up from Lulu's it's so cute again
for summer and the best
there's a bow in the back that's my
favorite and I actually picked it up in
mind for an outfit with this dress that
I picked up from Lulu so this is just
this gray and white pinstripe a dress I
got the gray one they have it in navy as
well so then this is the dress that I
picked up and I thought it would go
really cute with this hat like I just
want to go I want to go to a winery just
wear this outfit like I feel like Anna
green gables I picked up this hat too
but hats are really weird for me because
I have such a big head so I find
sometimes when I buy hats they don't
look that great I don't know if it I
don't know if I I don't know if I can
pull it off I don't think it's working
so you know how we discovered in the
spring brunch pants we were just like I
don't know why but I want to call them
brunch pants and it just worked and like
we've stuck with it ever since I feel
like I've officially found a brunch
shirt I didn't know that there was gonna
be such thing but I found it guys I
found our brunch shirt and this is it
this shirt is incredible it's got like
the flowy sleeves I feel like flowy
sleeves and flowy pant legs equals
brunch the next dress I have to share
with you guys again channeling those
youtuber vibes so this dress is from
Lulu again with the tan kind of color
going on very boho and it'll just be
like an easy dress to throw on for the
summer this kind of like woodsy vibes
like this color and like plants and
stuff I don't know apparently I think
I'm just like a walking urban outfitters
now which speaking of I also decided to
pick up this tie-dye dress from Lulu
so this is what it looks like it's like
great I diet super open and flowy on top
goes down into this giant maxi and has a
little thing that you can tie a bow tie
on with perfect for summer so cute also
gonna be super cute too just to keep
stocked in my closet for like vacations
and stuff like that I love tie-dye
dresses for vacation last but not least
I'm gonna end this entire wall on some
brunch pants there these navy blue and
white stripes and then the cool thing
about them is they have it's like like
high-low thing going on in the leg
they're just like these super comfy
flowy brunch pants that you could rock
with that brunch top the white one oh
yeah I did that they're stretchy they're
comfy and they're ready for a good stack
of pancakes or waffles and so
there you guys have it thank you guys
for indulging in this little summer haul
with me and supporting my spending
habits those are all of the things that
I bought for this summer I'm gonna try
really hard now to not spend too much
money on anything like article related
