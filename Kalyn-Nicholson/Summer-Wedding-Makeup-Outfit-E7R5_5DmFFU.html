devastated I just filmed ten minutes of
this get ready with me and none of it is
saving - my memory card because my
camera keeps freezing just so cool
annoying so basically what you guys miss
I started out with taking off any
residue off my makeup with the Urban
Decay meltdown makeup remover so I
started with this all over my face kind
of got like an oily texture to it you
massage it into your skin and it takes
off all of your makeup I keep this in my
purse guys just in case I like end up
sleeping over at like my boyfriend's
house or if I'm just like having one of
those days where my makeups bothering me
you could literally go to like a public
bathroom and use this and it would take
all your makeup off it's that good
latest obsession and basically took off
a little bit of like mascara residue I
had from yesterday because I'm going to
a wedding today I wanted to make sure
that like my skin was looking nice and
good because guys if you've been
following my Twitter or my snapchat
you'll know how to hectic weekend I
haven't had that much sleep I put on the
keel calendula and a low soothing
hydration mask so this is what it looks
like it smells amazing and it's a
hydration mask and I've used it before I
leave it on for about five minutes and
during that time I went and like made
myself a coffee and I was talking to you
guys about the candle and burning back
there which is Tiki Beach my bath and
Bodyworks because I just got a new order
in and boom my camera froze and none of
it recorded I used this when I came back
from all my trips and it like
rejuvenated my skin gently and gently
just threw up so um be right back update
that link is okay just got back from my
dad this morning and I have a weird
suspicion based on the throw up that I
just picked up that Bentley got into my
brother's cat food so yeah there's that
we can't just suspend that if it might
weekend a nut shell just throw up but a
great weekend but is it's been a hectic
weekend in my car go jog I got hit by a
truck it's not like an aggressive hit
but like some truck hit my Jeep I lost
at ping pong which is the biggest upset
of the whole weekend and Bentley just
threw up so there should be something a
little harder
than than just almond develop is all I
gotta say really quick I'm going to
moisturize my face with the Kiehl's pure
vitality it skin renewing cream this has
been my a lot of you guys been asking
for my skincare routine so I'm showing
you guys actually a lot of it in this
video this is my wheelhouse to take off
my makeup and this is my baby when it
comes to like nourishing and like
hydrating my skin this is my second
bottle of this guys I'm like obsessed
with it um so I just like I like to rub
this all over my neck and my face before
I go to bed and also before I do my
makeup I'm going to go in and prime it
with the Urban Decay b6 vitamin infused
complexion prep climbing spray I'll
leave a link to all my products down
below and I'm just going to cut in and
out and talk to you guys when when the
timing feels right and in the meantime
I'm going to put on my summer forever
playlist which I'll also link down below
because I need some good guys guys like
while I apply light beat my face you
know
me
Oh
I'm synced with my naked urban decay
heat pallet so I actually recently got
sent this and I was so excited to try it
out literally every single time that I
have used this palette people have been
like your eyes look so blue right now
and I'm like so I've been like obsessive
using these like orange you're like more
warm tones chaser first on a fluffy
brush like a fluffy blending brush I'm
not sure if I'm going to do red lipstick
or not so I kind of want to keep my
crease or like my eye like a little bit
not naked but a little bit more subtle
with base notice and they don't want
some like dramatic cat eye cut crease
god knows what else the starting of
chaser I'm going to put that into my
crease and then we're going to work our
way up to maybe soft and low blow but I
don't think I'm going to go any darker
than those so these are the street I'm
talking about so I'm starting with this
one here might move up to this one and
then that one's like a potential if it
doesn't seem dark enough in your ex
Oh
just you
in your eggs okay so while I let my
mascara dry guys it's going to be the
first time that have worn lashes since
Scott only knows I think the last time I
wore lashes is when I filmed my Europe
haul which was not that long ago mines
you still get me wrong I love gluing fur
to my eyeballs I also find that once I
start wearing them I kind of a look get
like addicted to wearing them I feel
naked without them and I don't like that
feeling but I'm only going to wear
lashes when it's like a special occasion
or like something fun like that so I'm
going to wear them today with that said
so those of you guys that do love your
your fur with your eye furs let me just
say that ever since I stopped wearing
eye furs my lash lashes like my actual
lashes have grown in it's so much
thicker even in just the past few weeks
that said I'm about to fur up my
eyeballs anyway so these are the lashes
that I'm just going to throw on in just
a second I'm using the Too Faced milk
chocolate Soleil because I have like a
darker foundation office I have tanner
on right now this probably won't show up
that dark it'll just give us a tiny like
hint of a shadow I wanted to keep it
soft today this is the what I'm going to
use to contour and I'm just using a big
giant large powder brush
just you
hey in the Rex
rapping system let a little get ready
with me on the lipstick I ended up going
on oh my gosh like 7y i boorish i end up
going on the red lipstick and going the
bit just because once I tried on the
dress I was like okay this needs red
lipstick I can't not I ended up curling
up my hair with the Bellamy I think it's
one and a half inch curling wand and I
took two chunks and just bought weekends
them into the back of my head and that's
literally all I did for mayor and then
after my dress is actually from Lilith
again I'll leave a link to it down below
if you guys want to check it out
question I'm going to be using is this
one here so I'm just going to carrying
this around with me all night and I'm
just wearing it with these shoes that I
believe that also got from Lulu is a
long time ago I'll leave some links to
them down below but that just means
that's black strappy you just kind of
want to keep it basic does this just not
kind of remind you of Archie a little
bit I don't know a lot of this literally
why I chose to wore this dress is
because the floral pattern and the
colors reminded me of Archie and slash
Riverdale's of like you know what this
is going to be my dress of choice oh
yeah that's kind of like my nice
decision-making behind this outfit so
definitely check out all the links down
below for all the makeup products I use
the skin care stuff that I use the
outfit and all of the things in between
I hope you guys enjoyed getting ready
with me sorry this was a more of a
chitchat I'm in such a rush today but I
figured it'd be fun to show you guys
like a little wedding look considering
it is wedding season and yeah other than
that I love you guys tuning in back and
I will see you guys all in my next video
bye
