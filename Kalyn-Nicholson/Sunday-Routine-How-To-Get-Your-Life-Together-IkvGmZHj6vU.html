take map six hello guys and welcome back
to my channel for today's video I'm
doing a kind of like a Sunday routine
but also adjust your teen I just felt
like if I quit just in the title a lot
of people might not know what I was
talking about but those of you who have
been in the coast crew did we just
discover our group name oh my god I love
that okay so for those of you who have
been in the clothes crew for a while you
guys may remember at the time where I
told you guys what this day is and it's
a gyst which means get your
together I've been doing this for a
while since like a year and a half ago
and every Sunday I usually plan out a
just day if you're wondering what it
just say is it's like one day that you
plan either once a week or once every
two weeks to just like literally get
your together to get all of the
things that kind of fell behind through
the week even just like miscellaneous
like mediocre things like doing the
dishes getting your laundry done washing
your bedding whitening your teeth things
like that words like you don't have time
to do these things all the time but when
you plan one day to get all of the
things that kind of fall on the
backburner through all of the other
weeks it keeps you on top of your
you know so since its bin I think it was
last fall I did a Sunday routine with
you guys this isn't necessarily a Sunday
routine because every just day is
different it's whatever has fallen
behind through the week hence why I'm
doing this video vlog style with you
guys so I can verbally update you and
just give you tips along the way but
today I'm going to film a just routine
with you guys where I'm literally
spending all day today being Sunday just
literally just getting things done and
kind of giving you guys tips on how to
do the proper gist you know so first
things first I actually just got back
from Gregg's house I slept at his place
last night we went out with a couple of
our friends so it's actually a little
late into the day it's 11:20 we woke up
at 10:00 because we have got we got like
no sleep on Friday and no sleep last
night because we were just out so late
so we decided to sleep in which is very
rare for me because I know in my morning
routines and through the week I wake up
really early you guys already know that
but on Sundays I like to just kind of
like let myself just sleep until I wake
up naturally Saturdays I still try and
wake up early though mind you but it's
just to keep myself in the routine but
they're kind of like a little
free-for-all so on the way home - I
picked up a decaf latte hey guys come
back on it like I'm not gonna live there
was a long time when I first started the
60-day no caffeine challenge where I
didn't need to touch decaf but now I'm
like I usually drink about one decaf
coffee a day like I'm more than 30 days
in but just can't separate a girl from
her coffee okay if you guys are
wondering what I got I got a grande
skinny cinnamon Dolce latte it's decaf
with coconut milk it's so freakin good I
like to start off by just days with some
some warm beverages some hugs and mugs
and pull out my day planner and then
I'll make a list of all the things that
I need to do on my chest day there's
like multiple categories in my jist day
there's like cleaning planning beauty
food / chill so without further ado
let's jump in I thought the toppings had
before
I feel like you guys can't really see me
with these on should I take a look no
you're only the one so the cleaning
portion of my gist routine is officially
done and might I say I feel fan tastic
there is literally no better feeling
than having like a freshly cleaned
apartment on a Sunday afternoon just
saying that warmed my soul so it took me
a few hours to get it done and I
actually there's some stuff that I
didn't end up blogging or filming on
camera just because I thought the b-roll
would be super boring but I actually
took down the little closet sectional
that used to be here because one the bar
from it was missing it kind of just
became this place where I just threw
things that I didn't feel like putting
away including like Greg's section of
like clothes of he leaves here now it
looked really bulky there and now I feel
like I'm missing something I may need to
get like a plant or something to put
there just look so much bigger so now
that my apartment is cleaned I just lit
up some candles so that the whole place
starts to smell really good although
I've been burning a lot of candles
lately in general I'm always here
editing or writing or getting things
done so I've been burning candles to
kind of like set the vibe for work my
apartment always just smells like
walking into Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it's
frickin incredible I think I'm going to
need a bison McCandles soon but I'm
waiting for the fall ones to come out
but I want to do like a face mask and
like a nose deal and whiten my teeth and
I got this new teeth whitener that I
want to share with you guys but also I
don't know if I won
do that first the work section first you
know I want to do I think I want to do
the beauty routine first then work then
relax I feel like that might be the
holiday nobody literally have the
attention span of a two-year-old anyways
I'm going to do the beauty routine next
and then move into my work routine
I might make like a just you know page
for my tumblr or something or for my
blog and I will leave it down below
check it out it'll have like check marks
on how to get your together day
like things you can do to clean your
house and you can do to catch up on like
your beauty routine and all that fun
stuff
I think I'm just I think I just decided
I'm going to make that so check that
link down below and let's move in let's
move into the beauty regimen of the day
okay
so I'm going to wait make peace with the
white with style I've never done this
before so I'm going to do it right on
camera so it is cruelty free BPA free
gluten free vegan and 99.9% kosher in
case you want to know
so it says teeth whitening instructions
brush and floss before whitening your
team places small drops of gel onto each
tooth impression on each tray
oh
okay so first expert can finally peel
this off this was like not Drive
when the other one other part of it was
I know that's so satisfying though with
a white mighty tire I feel like Ross
kind of from friends when he weighs the
seeds and they like glow like hey oh my
god that was awesome I actually really
liked Scott that was like one of those
things that I've been needing to do for
so long you guys know how much coffee I
used to drink flash has started drinking
again now I like it to look I'm probably
going to buy one of these for Gregg he's
been wanting to witness tea for so long
he keep seemed like hope me plate a
product store this away so I can use it
again I think you guys it looks like you
get about three uses per kit okay so now
that that's done I'm going to throw a
quick face mask on to put my I think
going to put the same ACDC shirt on
cause clean and get back into some comfy
clothes because I'm just still chillin
in my robe
is my so now moving on to the third
slash forth again edge to little size
section of the gist day and that is the
work section so for those of you guys
that obviously may not have works new if
you don't have any homework or like if
you don't have any even just like goals
or hobbies to work on like for instance
if you wanted to start like a youtube
channel you could be doing some research
like I'm doing a bunch of research
because I might be taking some part-time
classes again this fall so I'm going to
be researching some things like that I'm
going to be editing some videos working
on seals a little bit and doing some
emails some suggestions for you guys so
for this section could be even
researching things like how to budget
when making yourself up budget making
yourself like a dream board this could
be a great time to like plan out your
week that's the other thing that they
need to do is fill up my day planner and
my calendar can plan out like my videos
and stuff so you could use this time to
plan out your schedule and or you could
just skip right over this and go right
to the next section which is the relaxed
section of the jist day I think I'm
going to mesh that part with the relaxed
part where I might pop on a movie and
edit a video it's also 6 o'clock so this
look a good time I feel like to start
winding down the night enjoying the
clean apartment enjoying the fresh like
body and face and teeth and just like
sits my laptop and get to work
so it is now 10:30 I'm officially
winding down I ended up watching like
five or six episodes of them being on so
you guys have hi my mother but I edited
two videos which felt so good I ended up
working a lot later than I thought I
really need to get those videos done
despite the fact that I didn't really
get a chance to like read it's called
the problem with forever if you guys are
wondering I'll leave a link to it down
below but I still felt really good to
get all that stuff done that I needed
and I actually ordered my groceries for
tomorrow too so already a step ahead for
my Monday game which just days like this
are so frickin satisfying I am such a
nerd and I know it if you guys are
watching this and you wanna have a just
a check out that thing down below that

jist day and I'm just I'm going to bed
