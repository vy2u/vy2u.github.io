channel for today's video I am doing a
lazy day with you guys because I know
I've done like a lazy day slash just
days with you guys before but I feel
like we've never done a holiday version
one it is currently Sunday it's actually
Sunday December 3rd for I just got home
last night I was actually with Greg and
he had to head to work he's been working
like freaking crazy so he dropped me off
where he was working and then I grabbed
a coffee and joke here it was weird it
is so foggy in Toronto today I couldn't
even see the CN Tower on my overdrive
from there to here which is like
literally a five minute drive but
everywhere was so foggy
um and the latte I got I'm not gonna lie
I got a peppermint latte and it's not
it's not very good I'm a little upset so
I'm gonna I'm gonna I think I'm gonna
toss it and make a normal coffee here
but welcome there's so much juicing that
needs to happen today it's kind of
ridiculous
first things first my hair and my face
are a hot mess I really want to put on a
face mask I really want to put on a hair
mask my apartment
isn't even hotter mask the amount of
like dishes and laundry and just so much
stuff that I have to do I also have to
edit today's video and get that up so
that's gonna take a huge chunk out of my
day we're gonna make cookies like it's
just today's gonna be such a good day
it's actually funny I also have to pack
today in this vlog I'm going to LA
tomorrow from tomorrow until Thursday so
by the time that this vlog goes live
that vlog will already have been up so
if you haven't seen it I'll link it on
the screen you guys want to watch that I
I mean that is already up so without
further ado we have a lot of adjusting
to do if you guys don't know what
justing is or you haven't seen any of my
chest routines before basically justing
is this thing i made up where it's
getting your together every Sunday
I like to gist all my ducks in a row so
that I can start the week like a badass
that is what I'm gonna be doing today I
will link
pass gist routines down below and with
that said let's begin shall we
I definitely need to make a new coffee
because I don't know what it is I think
that all my melt that a lot of like
random I'm half a is used it's just like
it tastes kind of like plasticy in the
gather as always smile bloodhound upon
taking a gander at my schedule I think
the biggest thing that you need to get
done today is definitely edit today's
video so that it's up in time so that's
gonna be the first thing that I tackle
on this just day I mean like the coziest
outfit ever so I think all I'm gonna do
is just take this hat off throw a hair
mask in my hair wash my face put a face
mask on cozy up up on the couch
definitely plug in the Christmas tree
because we can't forget plugging in the
Christmas tree and probably edit for the
next two to three hours it used to take
me like 2 to 3 days to edit a video and
it's crazy just like how much better and
faster you get as time goes on it's
definitely going to be a lot more
cutting and editing for that one so it
will take me a decent amount of time but
that said I can put on a Christmas movie
and be jolly about it that's definitely
gonna be the plan I don't think I'm
gonna change it of this out because I'm
actually super comfy this coffee is a
lot better than the liquid plastic that
I was just drinking I'm excited to clean
honestly I just want to get through
editing so I can get to the cleaning
part of the day because I'm in the mood
to clean
- baby the table under the tree
it's a baby I'm curry down the chimney
tonight
so baby's convertible
Stan's a baby and hurry down the chimney
tonight
 debate these ended up making
another copy and finishing the vlog it's
officially done I just have to upload it
which means that we are in the cleaning
portion of the gist a and my favourite
to be quite honest I have been watching
the home alone from the background while
I was editing which was probably the
third time I think I've seen home alone
this year I'm thinking of making an
entire like movie bucket list that I
want to try and hit all throughout like
the month of December before Christmas
for instance like for my flight tomorrow
I could listen to music or I could load
up quite a few that I want to hit before
the Christmas starts there's a Christmas
story
Rudolph like the old cartoon Rudolph I
don't know why did I love that one
holder Express the Grinch which I have
watched this year but if we're starting
new then the Grinch elf which I also
watched was Greg when we put up the
Christmas tree but you can never watch
out too many times I know I know him I
just watched both the home Alone's today
I don't really like home alone 3 &amp;amp; 4 so
we're just gonna scrap those there's
like a mary-kate and Ashley Christmas
movie that I really like so I believe
it's like to grandmother's house we go
or something like that I could be wrong
Frosty the Snowman a Charlie Brown
Christmas Jack Frost which is also a
really good one I feel like there's
probably so many that I forgot I'm gonna
put these all into a condensed list and
put it on my blog I will leave a link to
it down below if you guys decide to take
on the Christmas movie bucket list then
let me know I also just made a Christmas
playlist which I'm debating listening to
while I clean either that one or I might
listen to I made a cold weather country
playlist probably gonna listen to that
as I clean I have a lot of cleaning to
do today is gone quite smooth
our guess completes the cleaning portion
of the day I mean it is still day mind
you it's only 5:30 at night but it's
pitch black outside now that I get to
stark so early I feel like by 8 p.m. I'm
ready to go to bed it feels so much
later than it is I was technically only
cleaning for an hour and a half but it
feels like I've been cleaning for like
two to three hours so now I'm gonna hop
in the shower wash out this hair mask
and I just could take these off now it
actually makes me kind of sad cuz
Bentley's not here today I don't know if
you guys noticed but I've had like a
little day away from the kids you know
because I leave for LA tomorrow
Bentley's actually in my hometown I
drove him there yesterday
he's staying with my brother at my dad's
house I feel like those moms where the
kids are off at the babysitters or a
daycare ready to have like a hot shower
and a glass of wine
I need snacks about someone staring at
me like please say can I have some mold
I'm also going to plug in all of my
things like headphones laptops and
things like that to charge since I'm
leaving in the morning and I still need
to pack my bag so there's still quite a
few things to do also gonna order dinner
the best thing about Sunday's okay real
quick it's because you clean your whole
apartment the last thing you want to do
is mess it up by making dinner so
Sunday's are like my takeout day and
then I might even try and hit off
another Christmas maybe which would be
three Christmas movies in a day but it's
Sunday so that doesn't feel wrong at all
let's shower scene at home alone where
he's like singing white Christmas in the
mirror basically you're gonna go doo doo
doo doo doo
this my
just like the ones I used to know
treetops
- you took the sleigh bells in the snow
with good
Jamie
Christmas with every Christmas card I
write
no your day
all your businesses
oh yeah
and may all your Christmases so just now
actually 1134 Craig is here he's
actually technically he's passed out on
the couch we made cookies and I finished
packing up pretty much as much stuff as
I can pack up up to this point because
in the morning I'm gonna go for a run so
I still need to use kind of like my
makeup and my hair stuff so with that
said that concludes today's lazy day
just day I hope you guys enjoyed if you
guys haven't seen it already I kind of
did a breakdown where I wrote out
everything that sums up what you do on a
just day so if you guys want to see that
I will link that down below as well as
the playlists and the Christmas movie
bucket list which reminds me I need to
load the Christmas movie aside from that
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you guys are enjoying the V at 12
days of Kanis and aside from that I will
see all of you guys in tomorrow's video
