my channel for today's video we're doing
another zodiac get ready with me and it
is the horses turn if you can't tell
so the tourist element is earth their
timestamp is April 20th to May 20 their
colors are green and pink their
strengths are being known as reliable
patient practical responsible and their
weaknesses include being stubborn which
I know a few Tauruses all of which are
very stubborn because their symbol is
the stubborn bolt do that make sense so
lucky numbers are 2 6 9 12 24 and what
what else is there apparently they love
to be surrounded by romance and beauty
they like luxury things they like nice
clothes they like music cooking all of
that stuff which is funny because all
the tourists I know are also really good
cooks or bakers and so using all that
and drawing off the inspiration of that
and the inspiration of the choices I
know I came up with this get ready with
me look inspired by its a stubborn bolt
I'd never wear any kind of jewelry so
wearing this right now is so weird I
don't know if I can pull it off but the
sake of this video we're doing it anyway
also really quick if you guys didn't
know this already my coffee talk
podcasts have been live for a while now
we have four official episodes already
out there a cash box original and that
they go live on Apple and Spotify too
I'm gonna leave all the links to my
coffee talk podcast down below episodes
go out every single Monday and if you
rate and review it really really helps
get it around you know get it circulated
on the interweb a little bit more for
those of you guys that have already been
listening you seem to be really enjoying
them and all of the feedback has been so
great so thank you guys so much because
it's such a new avenue for me and it's
such
prosze but I'm having so much fun with
it we get to have like a weekly life
chat and I record them while I'm
actually drinking my morning coffee so
in a way it feels like you guys are
sitting there with me in my sweatpants
while we just talk about all things life
we've done a social media of being a
beginner we've done trusting yourself
how to kick ass and achieve goals all of
that stuff so if you guys want to join
the talks of the caffeinated people then
definitely check out the links down
below and aside from that if you guys
want to is check out how I created this
get ready with me for tours with all the
new products that I'm trying for the
spring then just keep watching with
Bentley for a run this morning and then
I had to bike to go see this menu that
I'm using for HR on a meet-up so when I
showered it kind of maybe didn't wash my
hair no though it needs to disappear
forgot it Bentley's okay so I'm gonna
try to make products in today's get
ready with me which is kind of exciting
I had a few parcels get delivered to me
while I was away and some of them had
some new makeup and stuff so I figured
why not try it out oh well you guys have
I think it's worth the price or worth
the purchase but I'm like a makeup
expert by any means see how it goes
some of the things that I will be doing
though haven't changed one of them being
my foundation routine I'm still obsessed
with the bare minerals bare Pro this has
been my baby I would say the past two
months now and lately since I've been
kind of simplifying you know with
traveling and just in general and being
in Thailand where I didn't wear makeup
the whole time I've been getting really
into not really wearing as much makeup
or simplifying my makeup routine it's so
the thing I like about the bare minerals
bare Pro is I just like pumping on my
fingers and just completely like put it
on my face with my hands very old-school
with me because I'm gonna want this
makeup to last all day I have to make it
last into the night thing on the Too
Faced hangover Reimer I'm gonna go on
top with my bare minerals bare Pro and
I'm in the color
Celia has also stayed the same I'm still
using the tarp tarp I've been trying to
drink less coffee guys so I had my 2:00
this morning and then I'm not having any
more coffee anymore after that it's been
like my new goal brings a little finish
like I feel it I'm using my tart shave
tape in the color of light and I'm gonna
use this to conceal to set that in place
and when we use my bare minerals bare
Pro this palette is a little dirty from
being in my makeup bag but it's the
contour palette I'm just gonna take the
color pop and put that over basically
where I just did my concealer then I'm
going to that was a wicked catch
yourself again later but then I thought
I'm going to go in and set my foundation
with the bare minerals bare Pro or
natural and it's also got like a tiny
bit of coverage it's just good for just
like the little bit of break is that I
have going on no that's all out of the
way it's good to the fun stuff I think
for today's get ready with me since
tourists I am going to do some really
cool like Bowl inspired things with my
hair and I also have some jewelry and
stuff for that but for the makeup I feel
like I'm inspired to do something I
don't know like kind of fresh face but
also really cute I want to just
accentuate my features with some spring
like neutral spring colors especially
because the hair and the jewelry is
gonna be a little intense so I'm gonna
start with my eyes I got this sent to me
laws way it's the Too Faced natural eye
palette let's check this bad boy out
trying to use colors that are kind of
like remind me about the coloring of a
bowl this is what the palette looks like
Purdy
this will definitely work so this is
what we got going on in the inside I
think I'm gonna use like these colors
and then maybe this one down here oh my
god it smells so good
I'm gonna use this one just to start
like a bit of a base with everything
Oh forgot to do my brows I hate when
that happens color actually has a lot of
pigmentation it's depressed and we do
put some some more color underneath I'm
gonna take Kashmir bunny which is this
color here and just pop a bit more of
that on the lower lashline you make it
pop a bit more actually I'm gonna put a
bit of Kashmir above me in my crease -
and then I'm gonna take heaven which is
this color here and just put that on the
inner tear duct and then for the middle
of my lid I think I'm gonna use silk
teddy because the tourist color horses
do have some pink like they're cut one
of their colors is pink oh my god oh my
god is some insane transfer that's Purdy
okay so apparently we're not going chill
in the eyeballs but that's cool this is
so like sparkly let's add some honey pot
we're gonna have a tiny bit of honey pot
- I don't know what happened there okay
I like it I'm going to touch up with Kat
for everybody because sparkles got a
little out of hand there so for brows
I'm using my the Tarte double duty
Beauty these guys are here I'm still
using these still obsessed them the
lighter one this is in the color taupe
and when you unscrew it it comes with a
little spoolie and I'm gonna go just
gonna comb those through my brows
and then I'm going to contour my face
and they go back into the same
contouring palette contour my cheekbones
and I think we'll add a few fake
freckles and a lipstick first ahead of a
she want the last name with the rag on
cuz that pulled on him million cash told
up Lancome mascara this is gonna be a
new one that I'm trying to so it is the
bareMinerals mega volume mineral based
mascara just pulled this out of my
parcels today first glance review I
might let that soak in a bit before I
try to add another coat and in the
meantime I'm going to try and add some
freckles
I think might use what we use for my
brows this might go horribly I'm not too
sure but when I think of Taurus it's
spring and I found out in Thailand that
I actually get freckles on the side and
so I don't know the way I'm picturing
things my mind I just kind of want a
little bit a couple little baby freckles
you know
okay probably going to do that second
coat now so I'm gonna highlight my face
really quick I'm using the NARS fourth
the throws it's actually a really subtle
highlight like it doesn't come out super
super strong so I feel like it's perfect
for highlighting like your face more so
because it's not so that BAM in your
face it's like cute and subtle so I put
my freckles right over where I put my
light but then to finish off the look I
have these new NARS like lip stains that
I really want to try I'm gonna be all
makeup professional and give you guys
swatches oh that's pretty
the Freak would oh it's very similar
just a little less go more brownish
tinge to it it's this one American woman
that's pretty good I feel like it's too
dark for what we're going for today that
is American woman and then hop what it
is the last one so I might as well just
watch it since I've done the other ones
now oh that's cute - this one's more
corley so that is hot blooded I think of
all of these though the first two are
probably the closest to what we're going
for it I still look freaked because I
feel like it's a little bit more thing
and then I'm going to go over it with
under arrest
lipgloss okay well that all sets I'm
going to put I got a little fake nose
ring I figured since it was Taurus I
could not get like the bull ring thing
going so oh there we go
for my hair I want to kind of keep that
bull inspired thing going I'm thinking
of doing like two buns of the top of my
head and I just probably put makeup in
my hair so I'm just gonna start by
brushing my hair into a middle part and
then they need to part it all the way
down back as well brush it out alright
just like a little bit of hair towards
the front so that I can curl it I'm
going to kind of comb it all towards the
top and then using my brush like rush it
up and then I'm just gonna twist them
into buns the other quick I'm gonna go
touch up these little pieces on the side
and switch into my outfit and then
you'll get the fool the full update okay
as for the horse outfit because they do
like luxury or like nicer clothes I just
have to of not put on a grubby outfit I
feel like I've got any combination
between comfort and cute and spring
because even those outfits black and
pink I feel like it's like it's if it's
a more grungy spring you know the whole
vibe we're going for right now so first
things first I feel like well hi
the whole of it is the top this stop is
actually formal Essenza it's like a bus
ta or busty or whatever I've been kind
of digging the idea of wearing these
four tops or crop tops in the spring and
summertime so I feel like it's a little
it's a little spicy you know and that's
very Taurus and then as for my cardigan
it is from Urban Outfitters the jeans
that I'm wearing are from H&amp;amp;M and then
my sandals which are the baby pink that
matched the bus da they are from urban
planet and they're so spring and they
just feel like they really pull out the
spring vibes in this effort and then you
know you can kind of wear it with like
you wear it was like one shoulder off of
the cardigan it's a kind of boho with
the buns and the nose ring anyway that
was the vibe I wasn't for this so there
you guys have it
that was my get ready with me for Taurus
I hope you guys enjoyed leave a comment
