for a moment and look at all that goes
on around us things we tend to overlook
every day or we just miss completely
direct vision on our devices but no
device can connect us to the earth like
adjust to Wi-Fi and to our souls like it
says to the feet of others feeds that
feed us nothing but materialism and envy
the earth is not envious no flower is
conscious of a way the other one blooms
it just is in its purest form
we've lost our purest form we've lost
the moment we're too busy trying to
capture it
then we miss it completely we're too
busy trying to fill our voids with
things rather than with life love
sunshine and laughter your family and
friends people to share these moments
we're here
so look up put it down before you get to
the end on the fine you've missed it all
too busy trying to look like you were
living that you never actually lived at
all
grab it feel it love it breathe it in
laugh so hard your stomach hurts cried
something beautiful get to know
someone's soul instead of their social
media the world is still yours you're
still here you have time all you have to
do just put it down
take a walk
you got diamonds in ice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
