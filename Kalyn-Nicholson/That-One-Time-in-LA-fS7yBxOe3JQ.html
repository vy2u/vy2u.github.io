morning guys it is day two in LA the
night got weird but we parked our car at
Santa Monica we wanted to just kind of
walk around and check it out couldn't
tell you where we parked our car and
then I met my manager Katie I met her
for the first time face to face last
night
what happened from there mo to a bar
that was like right on Santa Monica yeah
so then we went to this bar called
bungalow it was so fun and then
basically we ended up just party oh yeah
and then we ended up at a host party and
dance and just have a good time I've had
some breakfast
I had potatoes and a piece of toast of
any kind of bagel and now we're gonna go
goober to our car ring it's still there
fingers crossed
it's the moment of truth
she's still here
and then we're gonna go to the beach
which is why I have my bikini on so this
romper is from urban planet that I'm
wearing if you guys are curious the
bikini is from Victoria's Secret and
then I'm wearing high-waisted pink
bottoms from urban Planet
so let's go to the beach
are you ready for this
Santa Monica now we're gonna get some
vegan donuts and then get ready as a
child and then go out and meet JD and
Jordan and a bunch of other people so
that's going to be really really fun
this is gonna be life-changing if you
want the best for us like up ones
abysmal price this copy is giving me
life subject to what you just saw we
actually surprisingly did come back to
the hotel pretty early it was like
midnight 12:30 happy fourth of July we
are officially gonna get ready go out
and I think we're heading to Newport
Beach today with a bunch of people which
is gonna be super fun
and yes I'm like losing my voice as this
trip progresses but I kind of like it
because I feel like I sound like Brooke
Davis and Brooke Davis is my life goals
change guys so it is feel last morning
in LA we leave today we do the road trip
to Vegas LA was so much fun we got to
meet so many cool like fun amazing
people that just like welcomed us is
like one of their own and we got to go
sightseeing we got to see the Santa
Monica Pier we got to go to Venice Beach
without to go to hun to Newport for the
fourth of July and it was so cool and so
fun and just like nothing that we've
ever seen before I'm just so glad that
we just so very last minute decided to
do this like we decided we were gonna go
somewhere someday we just said let's do
San Francisco let's do LA let's do bad
guys let's just go booked our trip and
came here and it's probably one of the
best decisions I've ever made in my life
our hotel looks like a tornado literally
went through it we were barely ever here
this hotel room is a pigsty Liv you guys
like clips just to prove what I'm
talking about so we really have to
shower get ready as quickly as possible
and then pack up I don't know how we're
gonna do it but we're gonna have to find
a way so that means that this is the end
of this week's my life Monday I hope you
guys enjoy coming to LA with us we have
so much fun
this trip I'm not kidding you when I say
it was life-changing it actually was
100% without a doubt life-changing the
key no and you say your life flash
before your eyes when you die that's
kind of morbid guys I'm sorry
but I feel like it's the defining
moments of your life that would flash
before your eyes and I feel like there's
like not one second of this trip to San
Francisco and to California so far that
wouldn't flash before my eyes like and
the trips aren't even over yet we still
have to do that thank you guys so much
for watching I love you guys to the moon
and back and I'll see you guys all next
week cheers guys is it just me as the
world gone crazy lately
it's going no cannot see the way we're
evolving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
