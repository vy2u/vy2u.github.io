today's video I am finally or we are
finally filming the boyfriend tag so
this is probably it actually this is
definitely my most requested video it's
the most searched video and it's just
something that you guys have been asking
for for a very very long time so here we
are filming it so this is Ryan if you
want to say hello hey guys so we're
going to be answering some up the
boyfriend tag questions I know there's
like two different types of tag
questions so we're gonna do the first
one and then if it comes to be that we
go to film another video in the future
later maybe we'll film the second one of
course I'm just gonna jump right in and
start asking him the questions Ryan if
I'm sitting in front of a TV what is on
the screen depends on the time of day
usually I know it depends with you she
likes to watch a lot of dr. Phil yes I
do like my dr. Phil ah I like a big
abroad yeah Geoff television likes a lot
of television but she likes to pray a
little liars we watch we're getting into
it a lot of sense of Anarchy when I'm
like season six and Ed Walking Dead is
well off it's just you though Oh Oh
Dateline daylight is a big date laughs
and I'm not so much so you lady would
like mystery date line mysteries I don't
know why I like real life crime usually
would have gone a to you when she
watches it so when I come home its usual
ATAR alright most time you're out to eat
what kind of dressing do I get on my
salad ah obviously to be good so
anything that they have that you get
like vinaigrette usually I like dogs
Democrat all static vinaigrette other
than the obvious what is one food that I
don't like Wow other than the obvious
yummy uh some foods you don't like
actually I prefer that you don't like
there's definitely melons in general
right I like melon I don't like I don't
know I puked on watermelon as a kid and
ever since then I just can't eat melons
or cantaloupe or honeydew or any like
anything like that so you guys go to eat
and
I have a drink what do i order Diet
Pepsi
without a doubt you said you didn't why
not white wine I'll usually order a
glass wait maybe two when we first
started dating every soup order a lot of
wine but you know I don't like to drink
a lot but I don't mind like the casual
drink with dinner and it's usually like
a glass of wine started growing herself
this'll be interesting to see if you
know this one so what size shoe do I
wear size 6 definitely almost six and a
half yes I was very close so I'm
actually surprised you knew that if I
was calm if I was collecting anything
what would it be
clothes lots of it if you're walking her
bedroom there's clothes ok we have a
small bedroom and not a lot of storage
and 95% is hers I have a couple shirts
no no not true she obviously likes to
collect a lot of makeup as well yeah I
have teasing that's also a fire
department but I closed a makeup yeah
definitely what is my favorite type of
sandwich so bagels lettuce tomatoes and
cucumbers and pickles had mustard and
that's what you say onions I need to of
course I'm in lots mustard
what what would I eat every day if I
could because I obsess over a lot of
food you do well mostly fruits and
vegetables but I know she'd have sushi
deftly well everybody in sushi every
single day I don't really call it real
sushi but sushi without the meat so
without the fish ok what do people eat

like a trick question because it's
considered cereal but it's not really

as a cereal taffy oatmeal oatmeal brown
sugar to be exact I love oatmeal what is
my fav kind of music this is also kind
of a trick question because you could
say more than one yeah you like her

genre ah that ah I don't see like I like
yes Rd Rd yeah well country funky yeah I
love my country it's not number one but
it's like that's the want us is suppose
another trick question what is my
favorite sports team well she doesn't
watch as much sports as I'd like her to
watch and just watch a lot of hockey
which I'm pretty disappointed she does
watch football or I do like football I
do so her favorite sports team because

to be her favorite is the Philadelphia

so next question what is something that
I do that you wit wait no what's
something you do that I wish that you

actually technically too and it's
probably one of the biggest things that
bothers me about living together and
it's when he gets home and takes off his
socks he just dropped some great by the
couch and when he takes off Bentley's
harness he takes it off and drops it
right by his socks which are right on
the ground right by the couch and does
not thing to maybe I don't know hang it
up somewhere go throw your socks in the
laundry I can't get up late around he
did not he never dies I always do it
that's such a lot where what is my
heritage slash where am i from well you
