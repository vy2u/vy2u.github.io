sleeve right from the start making
memories you had bangs in a Honda Accord
I bought them jeans I couldn't afford
for you a party that today I am double
fisting the trick is that a ton of my
favorite fruit in here so that I am like
inspired to drink the water cuz once the
water drank I can eat fruit really yo
man what's up guys and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I'm doing
another coffee talk with you guys I've
got my coffee here in my juice juice mug
and I got my fruity water I'm trying to
adult today's video has been one that's
been requested by you guys so much and
it is to talk about the law of
attraction manifesting things living
your dream life thinking more positively
just all of that just all of that which
is a heavy topic I was a little
intimidated by the idea of making a
coffee talk on this there's still so
much that I'm learning about it using
things like the law of attraction or
positive thinking abundant thinking
manifesting the things that you want in
your life by visualizing them and then
kind of setting an intention with them
and then just creating action to call
those things toward you it's an idea or
a concept that I've been into for a few
years now I feel like even just the fact
that I'm sitting here in Toronto but I
look Bentley those are all things that
I'm used to you know visualizes are all
things that I used to put on my vision
boards those are all things that I was
trying to attract to me in hopes that it
would create a reality in the near
future or the future in general and it's
for that reason that I feel so strongly
about the law of attraction that said
guys I'm still such a newbie I feel like
there's still so much to learn and I'm
only kind of scratch the surface when it
comes to this stuff but all in all I
think I've summed up a pretty good idea
of my
standing of the law of attraction so far
in my life and if you want to grab my
mug we can sit down and chat about it
part one what exactly is the law of
attraction law of attraction is the idea
or concept that we attract to us that of
which we focus on or think about so the
idea behind it is if you think more
positively if you think at a higher
frequency then you kind of draw more
positive things or higher frequency
things to you just like if you're
thinking more negatively and tend to
draw more broody things or bad things
towards you for instance like a really
really simple idea of guys I mean ever
having a bad day or something sets the
tone of your day in the morning and then
it just kind of feels like everything
that follows that one moment that put
you in a bad mood just turns into like
one of those worst days ever even if
it's just simple little things like
spilling your coffee and then there's
also the example of those days where you
wake up and you're just in such a good
mood and like everything just seems to
happen so perfectly it's like the better
and happier example of the law of
attraction everybody kind of has bad
things that happen to them but it's all
about shifting your focus and shifting
your perspective and almost tuning the
frequency of your thoughts so that even
though bad things might happen like
something as simple as your coffee
spilling some days if you let that
bother you then you turn down the
frequency of your thoughts and suddenly
you start attracting more bad things to
you versus if you look at it as like no
real big deal and you kind of keep your
vibe high you just like brush it off
like it's nothing you turn your
frequency up and you bring your thoughts
to a higher level which then attracts
better things to you throughout the day
I remember when I was reading your about
us one of the easiest ways for me to
kind of wrap my head around the law of
attraction was the author Jensen
sharrows she kind of the way she
described it was it being like a radio
like imagine your brain and the
frequency of your thoughts are like a
radio and you're constantly tuning
whether you know it or not into certain
stations let's say you want to manifest
something that is super healthy or
abundant and joyful but you're tuning or
to something that's more negative or
lazy then it's going to be impossible
for those frequencies to match and for
you to tap into that station you can
shift your brain focus and shift your
thoughts to match the frequency of the
radio station that you're trying to tune
into then suddenly you're listening to
healthy abundant joyful music see now if
your thoughts are energy then that means
that every single thought that you think
which is a lot within the day if all of
those things are transferring energy
even just within yourself then it's
going to have a bigger effect on you
than you think to me everything has
energy thoughts are energy perspectives
are energy the way you interact with the
world around you is energy so what do
you think is ultimately what you create
so you could take the exact same
situation and think about it two
completely different ways and one
version of you could be a lot more open
to receiving better things from life in
the universe and another version of you
could be more doubtful and more afraid
and less trusting and for that reason
you closed your mind off to the
opportunities that kind of just sit and
wait for us to show up you can literally
change your reality at any given time
you can change your reality right now
however you felt coming into clicking
this video you can change your entire
perspective on life in this split second
just based on changing your thoughts
real quick I want to just like slide a
note in there because something that I
used to get really frustrated about when
I first started getting into things like
the law of attraction what I would feel
this like sudden shift to regulate okay
yes I get it like I'm ready to manifest
my life five minutes later I would find
myself brooding or in a bad mood or
thinking about something so be relevant
and so stupid and so almost like petty
and then I would just like you know
icing and cherry on top make myself feel
like crap how come I was just feeling so
good and now I'm back to feeling this
way like I suck at this I'm horrible
it's gonna take time to train your brain
I still feel like I have so much
training to do even though I talk about
this stuff a lot I still have really
crappy days that like I don't
necessarily show you guys or I getting
really bad news some
like it happens but it takes time it's
like a muscle you can't just expect to
get up one day having never ran a day in
your life and suddenly be able to run a
full-on marathon when we understand the
process and we accept the process that
we don't have to judge ourselves or be
hard on ourselves for not completely
clicking it right away it's important to
note that it's gonna take time it takes
training and we constantly have to work
at it to be able to stay in bigger
pockets of time in that kind of
frequency the amount of time that you'll
spend judging yourself and bashing
yourself for getting out of that
frequency just brings you down even
lower instead just be like you know what
I'm catching myself right now I'm in a
bad mood don't need me though and then
just like tune that frequency back up
pay extra for some guac go grab yourself
a coffee paint some aloe do what you got
to do just like shift yourself back
because if you start now if you think
right in a second above everything in a
more of a glass-half-full or it's no big
deal if you literally just decide you're
great in this second that that's what
you're going to do then your training
has already begun and you're already
starting to build those pathways in your
brain that will dig deeper and deeper
and make it easier for you to go to that
conclusion faster than what you're used
to or what your default mode is which
for a lot of us our default mode is to
either not be conscious of things around
us at all or to have a very negative
context with everything that happens
around us
life is great life is abundant I don't
need to be in such a cranky mood that
leads me to part number two how do you
use it
but mostly before you can use the law of
attraction you have to get really really
clear on what it is you're trying to
attract one of the things that you want
to manifest in your life ya get as clear
as possible you even just have a general
direction of the things that you want to
attract in your life or the things that
you're trying to manifest in your life
then you can use the law of attraction
much better and clearer and with more
precision than if you were to just try
and think more positively in general the
biggest things that helped me figure out
the things that I really wanted in my
life the things that felt authentic and
true to who I am the things that I
wasn't just doing for show what I was
doing it for a genuine joy within myself
I asked myself the things I like to do
when I was kid time with meditation and
writing and yoga there's just like this
level of consciousness that you start to
gain with yourself or you're like hey
what's up how we do it like how have we
been feeling lately is there anything
that we're really really feeling drawn
towards is there anything that we'd like
to see in our lives and you kind of
create this dialog in your brain
anything that creates just like I feel
good in your gut you know the feeling
that starts to show you or tell you or
guide you towards the things that you
want or want to attract or want to
manifest some of my best ideas or things
that I didn't even realize I wanted
until it hit me like a freight train
happen when I'm doing even just small
little things that bring me joy like
when I'm baking or when I'm sitting in
the shower
cleaning even like those are the moments
that you need to start generating more
of so that you know what you're actually
trying to attract into your life think
of the times that you've felt the most
bliss like the most happy peaceful state
of bliss was it when you were outside
was it when you were biking is it when
you're surrounded by the most important
people to you or surrounded by your
family is when you're surrounded by dogs
is it in warmer temperatures is it
exploring and traveling is it something
as simple as planting a garden in your
backyard it's visualize yourself
traveling visualize yourself planting
that garden and see the kind of feeling
that gauges within yourself if you
suddenly get so excited that you can't
contain yourself that's a pretty pretty
good indication that might be the
direction you want to start heading or
the frequency
start tuning into it's so clear on the
things that it is that you're trying to
manifest from big to small things
because even thinking about those things
creates a feeling inside of you and that
feeling inside of you when you get happy
and joyful and excited and just have
such a genuine intent to just enjoy your
life and find some bliss you're already
starting to attract those things towards
you and opening your brain to see the
easier pathway to get to those things
faster and so now that you've tapped
into the feeling or the frequency and
you've tied it to things or ideas or
hobbies that create more of that feeling
the next step is to go forth with
actions an author who put this in such a
way that it literally shook it's me to
that core was to gee I just finished
reading sacred powers and in that book
one of the biggest things that I loved
about it there was a huge section where
he talks about attention intention and
then action when it comes to the law of
attraction your attention should be
drawn to the things that you do want in
your life not the things that you don't
want in your life so stop thinking about
the things that you're afraid of and
start thinking about the things that you
would be excited for that's your
attention then you have to set your
intention I intend to whatever it is
even if you have no idea how on earth it
could possibly happen write it down
write it down everywhere write it down
every time you're losing that little bit
of spark because that is you setting
your intention and telling the universe
okay so this is what I want and then he
ties it all together with action where
you let go the attachment so you say
this is what I intend to do and you're
putting it out there that you want it
and then you let go and you focus on
what's actually right in front of you
and hopes that you planted that seed and
the universe is going to bring it to you
you let go of your control you let go of
your attachment to it you bring it back
to the present moment you fill the
present moment with as much good bright
light as you possibly can and he tuned
your frequencies so that you start
attracting it to you faster hand
gestures are very aggressive today there
is no way that any of this can work if
you don't trust if you even have the
slightest bit of doubt that'll create
static in your frequency and it'll
constantly be calling you back to shift
down to shift
to doubt that you can do the things you
want to doubt that you can have the
things you want and then trying to prove
to yourself by not having them that you
were right all along you don't want to
listen to that I trust the universe I
trust myself
I trust the timing of my life only three
things that you'll ever need to trust to
know that your life is exactly on the
right path and bringing you into exactly
what you want or what you need tap into
the present moment with full complete
trust and faith and whatever is already
lined up for you or what you're trying
to line up for yourself and you will
find that things will start shifting and
aligning without your need to let
micromanage or control part number three
you are what you think there's another
big thing that David G talks about in
sacred power is that resonated with me
and it was nourishment versus
distraction for me anyways I find when I
start to become fearful of life or I
start to doubt my life or doubt the
things that I'm trying to make happen I
start to use distraction rather than
nourishment to fill up my time because I
just want to tap out of the fears so bad
when he put it into nourishment versus
distraction it suddenly became so easy
for me to see how I was spending my time
in my life for the things that I was
lining up in my day a nourishment to the
things that I'm trying to plant and seed
and grow later on in my life or is it a
distraction to not have to deal with the
stress when you're thinking lazy when
you're thinking poor when you're
thinking negative when you think ugly
when you think competitive you become
those things versus if you think
abundantly if you think positively if
you think peacefully if you think kindly
if you think happily then you tune out
of the things you were thinking of
before and tune into that version of
yourself and then you will create feel
and attract more of those things to you
and this works even if you think puppy
if you think travel if you think plants
if you think fashion designer if you
think New York City you're tuning into
that version of yourself imagine your
brain as a girl
and you're taking seed and for every
time you plant one of those seeds you
plant one of those thoughts with
intention
you can then water it with action you
can then water it with bringing yourself
back to that intention you could water
it with nourishment you can water it
with doing things of high frequency that
make you feel good and make the people
around you feel good the more you're
watering those seeds and the more that
they'll start to sprout they'll start to
you know grow manifest into these
massive giant sunflowers or tulips or
whatever it is you you planted in your
brain I'm planting succulents planting
the seed you're fertilizing it with your
excitement and then finally you get up
and you jump into action and you start
living your life with that feeling with
that intention only to find that when
you turn around your freakin garden is
bloom but it's not gonna bloom if you
sit and you just stare at it if you
plant all these seeds and then you sit
back and go okay come on you need to
give it room to breathe you need to give
it room to grow with just a little bit
of faith and a little bit of chest
you'll open yourself to opportunities
and two mindsets that will set the tone
in the course of your life it won't come
from force and it won't happen if you
resist
don't try and attach to it just let it
happen enjoy the journey and just watch
it unfold and learn the lessons you need
to learn along the way and bring
yourself back to that higher level of
yourself for the highest version of
yourself as much as you possibly can
without any judgement of how many times
you fall off the words you breathe reset
the intention you plant the seed you
water it and you should get right back
to it that's it so that concludes
today's coffee talk I hope you guys
enjoyed a few of the books that I've
learned a lot of the stuff from that I
can think of off the top of my head
sacred powers I just finished it and I
highly highly recommend it you are a
badass obviously I've talked about this
book so many times but it was like my
first ever actually grasping the idea or
the reality of the law of attraction or
agreements is also really good and if I
can think of anymore I'll pop them down
below even right now there's like
there's quite a few things that I'm
trying to attract into my life or
manifest into my life and one of which I
booked last night if you've been

about all the elephant
trapping elephants into my life and
finally last night I was just like screw
it
I'm booking it I'm doing it lets my trip
to Thailand and I booked my day at the
elephant sanctuary maybe I'll do a blog
post kind of follow-up to this video in
a few weeks and just like talk more
about it I feel like I've been talking
forever so I'm all stop rambling leave a
comment down below letting me know the
things that you guys are trying to
manifest or attract into your life
