specific books now for today's video
because the book club wasn't already

give my review on this book here I'm
doing the power of now by Eckhart Tolle
but stay tuned to the end of this video
because I'm gonna share with you guys

reading so that and you guys can run out
grab it we can all read it together and
then at the end of each of book that I
finished reading I'm gonna post one of
these videos where we talk about the
book or I'll make a video based on the
book itself like I have some ideas for
the next one and yeah that's gonna be
the premise of our book club our koats
book club with a que no I feel like it's
too dark whatever I'm just gonna keep
going for today's video I'm gonna be
talking about the power of now by
Eckhart Tolle and read this book I just
finished reading it actually on my
Thailand trip was the very last day it
was the last night that I was there that
I skinned my eyes across the last pages
and I'm definitely feeling like I might
have to reread this book because it was
so it was almost so simple that it was
hard to grasp like he really does
simplify life and he simplifies
everything in a way that makes it easy
for us to just tune into the now and
live our lives but because it was almost
so simple it made it complicated for me
to fully wrap my head around a lot of
the concepts of this book it's only
because it's like it was that deep you
know it really
it was really a geing my ability to try
and see the world in a new way or see
the world through the eyes of our heart
old terms of this book I've summarized
everything that it's pretty much taught
me thus far
I mean round one I'm gonna have to
definitely reread it for around two in
terms of what I learned from it so far
let us begin number one is that time is
an illusion that was look one of the
biggest things that he talks about
especially the beginnings book I started
reading this via audiobook actually when
I was driving - come on come join us
we have someone joining us today so we
were driving it to South Carolina I was
listening to the audio book and I
remember the stop being one of the
biggest things that kind of stuck with
me and what I was listening to that
portion of the book was that time is an
illusion and this is something that I've
always kind of excused the train going
by this is something that I've always
kind of had an idea about and always
kind of believed in but he put it in a
way that was different than what I was
used to there was one part in particular
where he talks about how the past and
the future don't really exist they're
only mere reflections of the present and
that every moment you've ever lived in
your life has always been in the now
hasn't it and when he said that I was
like oh my god even the moment five
minutes ago was now but now it's in the
past and me thinking about it or even
talking about it right now is using this
moment than now to reflect on the past
it's so crazy because it's so simple but
when you say it like that it sounds
complicated the way you put it was that
when you reflect on the past or you
think about the future the past and the
future are like the moon and you're the
Sun and you're using your energy and
your light to reflect off of the moon
which is then giving the moon light and
it's giving the moon power so in a way
if you look at past present and future
that way the present moment that now is
the Sun the future is the moon the past
of the moon and so every time that you
lived in the pasture you live in the
future you're taking the energy of the
now and the power of the now and
reflecting it off of the future or
flexing it off of the past that made
sense you stress about the future or
you're depressed about the past you're
reflecting the light of the now onto it
even though it doesn't actually exist
even though it's not here and so we fall
into memory or we fall into anticipation
rather than falling into the now and
checking into this present moment right
now and taking everything that comes
with it and making the absolute most of
it so that you kind of stop being
controlled and confined by time and you
start having the ability to just open
your eyes and wake up so your life and
like wake up to right now even I'm like
oh my god I'm filming as simple as it
sounds and as weird as that sounds it
brings such a serene sense of peace to
look at life that way because suddenly
you realize all of the hidden pockets of
opportunity that are sitting right in
front of you at this exact second and
how spending your time and your energy
and thinking about it going or being any
other way is reflecting off of the
energy you have now the second thing
that I learned from the powernow was how
to connect to the now or how to connect
to the present moment he goes into a lot
of different life meditations and ways
to kind of pull apart the things going
on around you to kind of tune into the
now almost like noticing the gaps of
time between sounds even the gaps of
time between the words I'm saying to you
right now is suddenly pulling you into
the present because right now you're
trying to catch the moments of silence
between each of my words and also like
connecting to your body and doing like a
scan of your body from top to bottom to
just check in to where your body is that
because that's also something that we
tend to just run around in life and
forget it and our bodies are just like
tracing behind us and we don't even
realize how we feel we don't even
realize how we think we don't even
realize
know check in with our bodies even and
so even just doing the scan and even
feeling how your liver feels or like how
your kidneys feel it sounds crazy but
when you sit in the moment you meditate
on it you actually can feel it it's it's
it's like a pulse of energy where it
feels you to really go there it feels
like you know I'm a little tired today
or kidneys are feeling a little sad I
don't know how your kidneys would feel
sad but you'll feel it he also talks a
lot about present moment awareness and
doing things with your whole body
and the sense of not only just taking
the meditation standpoint of scanning
through your body but when you're
walking up stairs suddenly being so
aware that you're walking up stairs that
you use every single muscle to actually
put your foot down to lift up and put
your foot down to lift up and you're so
aware of the fact that you're doing it
that you feel muscles in your body that
you don't really recognize or notice on
a day-to-day basis and so doing things
with full present awareness and checking
it to the now it gives you that ability
to not only do things fully but be aware
of the things that you're doing fully
and then because of that awareness you
see that when you're walking up the
stairs you notice something and then it
leads to something else and so you're so
tuned into the present moment that
you're using your full ability and the
full capacity of your life to live it
and then also accepting and surrendering
to what is and this is the part that I
think they need to go back and reread
but for me the thing I struggle with the
most is resistance I don't think I have
a problem tapping into the now but I
think I do have a problem with resisting
it and it tends to boil up into my life
and affect me because I want to resist
what is and I have such an idea of how I
want things to be and I think that that
is where a lot of my anxiety can
sometimes come from and it's aware a lot
of like my self-doubt and feeling kind
of crappy you're just having a bad day a
lot of those times I think that stems
from me resisting what is and not even
realizing that I was doing it so when
reading the book when he talks about
like resistance and how we need to just
kind of surrender to what things
actually are it made it easy for me to
wrap my head around the types of
mindsets that I was putting on things
that I didn't even realize I was kind of
doing it's the one thing in particular
that he said that really stuck with me
was forgiving every moment for what it
is
no I'm forgiving this moment for exactly
what it is so that I can accept it for
exactly what it is and take the pressure
and the energy out of wishing it was
something different so that I can
actually work with it to make something
out of it does that make sense I'm
hoping it does I forgive this moment for
not being what I want it to be but I'm
accepting it for what it is so that I
can try and make it into something that
I want it to be accepting and
surrendering to what is so that you can
make it something that you want rather
than trying or wishing or hoping that it
was any other way and last but not least
the third thing that I really took from
the power of now was how to free your
mind not as like again one of the things
that I want to go back and reread this
book so it's more deeply ingrained into
my core but basically this is what I
took from it through your emotions your
your thoughts and through your pain body
so in terms of your emotions the way
that our mind feels comes up through our
emotions so when you're aware of that
you can catch your emotions and then in
turn figure out where your mind is
actually out to fix said emotions for
instance yesterday I felt so icky I felt
so weird all morning I couldn't shake
this feeling and it was such an emotion
that was so strong but I didn't know why
I was happening because I was so
attached on the emotion that I couldn't
get to the root problem and so emotions
were starting to come out without me
knowing them because I was suppressing
the way that my brain felt about
something and so I decided to just take
the day turn off my phone and go
technology free for 24 hours and just
kind of sit and fester with those
feelings and fester with those thoughts
and fester with those emotions so I
could connect to the root and really
deal with them and find the cause of
those emotions leads you to your
thoughts because our thoughts a lot of
the times are what creates our emotions
and in order to free yourself from your
thought you almost have to become aware
of your thoughts and he talks about
being like a silent watcher which is
cool because
never I do Tarot so I don't know if I
told you guys this before but I need
time I do Tarot I need time I pull the
card the High Priestess that is to me
anyway the connection that I've kind of
made with Tarot is that that's my Higher
Self and so I kind of consider my Higher
Self to be the watcher of my thoughts
whereas I'm like I mean I'm just
bubbling around doing my thang sometimes
I'm gonna good mood sometimes in a bad
mood but my Higher Self of a watcher as
Eckhart Tolle would say it's more
sitting back and just constantly
watching everything I do personally
watching everything I say and sometimes
if I can get quiet enough I can tune
into that part of my brain and I think
that it's something that you have to
kind of work at like a muscle but it's
becoming aware and observing your
thoughts rather than connecting to them
and not judging the way you think but
just watching the way you think in turn
to the school give you the ability to
catch yourself as negative thought
patterns and instead of judging yourself
for it which keeps you walked into those
negative thought patterns without that
sense of judgment you're able to catch
yourself doing it and three yourself
from it rather than judge yourself which
only creates more negativity which only
makes you brood feel like a victim cycle
continues so instead when you become the
watcher of your thoughts and the watcher
of your emotions in a lot of way you
find the root of the problem you don't
judge yourself through the problem and
then you just let it go free your mind
you know and then the pain body of being
the part of you that is holding on to
you know resentment or its kind of
harboring emotions that you haven't
dealt with from your past from maybe
even past lives if you believe in that
that is your painful residual pain from
the past this can be a harder one to
deal with because our pain bodies stems
from a lot of past things that might be
so deeply ingrained into our core
embedded into our core that sometimes it
takes you know getting professional help
to work those things out vegetation or
whatever it is to really get down to
those roots and relieve ourselves from
our pain body but there's a way that he
talks about that you can kind of do it
on a daily basis if that's not something
that you're able to do or you know if
you're looking for a bit more
faster fix while you deal with your
paint body or while you deal with the
bigger things in your life that might be
really deeply rooted and it's becoming
almost transparent this is one I read
this part in Thailand and it stuck with
me so strongly especially for flying
home where I was flying for like 24
hours and of course you start to get you
know irritable because you're tired you
can't really get a good sleep and this
just kept on popping into my head where
he talks about almost making your body
like a ghost in a way where annoying
sounds or little things that might
usually trigger you or something that
might make you feel really upset or
whatever whether they be words sounds
actions you know seeing something
reading something you turn transparent
and you let it float through you rather
than letting it hit you catch and hold
on to it especially when you're feeling
impatient and irritable like in traffic
jam and you got somewhere to be you just
let it float through you rather than
being that density and letting it catch
to you I'm a very visual person so when
I visualize myself as being transparent
and things that bother me are things
that are kind of getting to me going
through me rather than hitting me then
it makes it easier for me to just let it
go
hey I don't know why but it's just such
a serene thought process to kind of go
through even though a car toll talks a
lot about not holding on too much to
visualizations of things that type of
visualization really works for me so I
think I might hold on to that one just
let that negativity pass through you and
continue moving on to the next whatever
and you just you just go on as you is
feeling great so that concludes
everything I learned so far from the
power of now
I definitely like I said need to reread
it but there you have it it's a
life-changing book I highly recommend it
this is calm this is the book we're
going to be doing for the second video
