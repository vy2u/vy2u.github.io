don't even know what I'm trying to say
right now okay let's do this I'm ready I
let you mean so you walk through it's
only been day two hey guys what's up and
welcome back to my channel for today's
video it is the fourth day of Christmas
meaning there is only four days left
until Christmas and for videos left
until Christmas which is very exciting
but also very sad for today's video I'm
actually going to be introducing a new
style of video that I want to start
integrating into my channel but about a
week and a half ago I thought so nerdy
one night and wrote out all of these new
ideas so you know those nights that you
have where it's 2:00 a.m. and you should
be going to bed but you keep popping up
with like all of these amazing ideas
that you just need to get on paper you
know you're gonna forget the next day I
was having one of those days about a
week and a half ago and I came up with
so many video ideas and so many sort of
like series or themes that I want to
start doing on my channel and one of
them is this style of video allowing me
to explain I've done some videos in the
past where I talk about doing like
challenges like I did a 10 p.m.
challenge with you guys I think I've
done a fitness challenge at the
beginning of this year but basically
long story short I'm going to be
launching like a new series where if you
guys want to recommend a book or you
want to recommend a challenge me your
nails are loud the heated blanket time
either one that I come up with or one
that you guys request and actually do
that exact thing for two weeks and vlog
the experience give you guys updates
throughout it and come to an overall
conclusion over whether it's something
that you need to do or you should use in
your life and to start out I figured
with the New Year what better way than
to challenge myself to meditate every
single day for two weeks and see if it
made any sort of difference
so with that I actually ended up doing
the meditations that were from living a
life of awareness so I challenged myself
to read one of the meditations from this
book every single day for two weeks and
I actually brought this book with me
when I went on my Los Angeles ship if
you guys saw that vlog it was there that
I actually started the challenge and
picked this up for the very first day I
was just feeling a little like a little
funky like not necessarily on the trip
but just in like the background of my
mind I had been feeling off lately and
that's kind of also why I decided to do
this challenge I brought this book with
me and decided to start the challenge
while I was there instead of waiting
until I got back because I just I just
didn't want to wait anymore I was hoping
it was gonna make me feel a bit better
so for the 14 days of following that day
I have done one of these meditations
every single day I talked about it with
you guys in my night routine and I think
I've shown it in a few videos now that
I've been doing them so if you guys
don't know her you haven't heard of this
book it is called living a life of
awareness and their daily meditations on
the Toltec path I've talked about the
book The Four Agreements before but that
is one book that I actually live very
much by when it comes to kind of my
belief system I try and go a lot by The
Four Agreements so this was actually
written by the son of the man that wrote
The Four Agreements and these are the
meditations that he suggests reading and
practicing every single day and what I
did is in every single meditation it
always begins with a little bit of
insight and then a practice for the day
so I would take the insight read it over
look at the practice and find a way to
integrate that into my day so with that
I took this book and started the
challenge
practice with awareness notice when you
attach the idea of happiness and to the
future when this happens say to yourself
I won't wait for happiness I choose to
be happy now
interesting yesterday's on quieting the
mind I feel like it really well with but
this one isn't necessarily like I do it
right now kind of meditation I mean it
is I have to drive to Kingston today so
maybe instead of only feeling relaxed
and happy once I make it there why not
make the whole process of leaving
packing up driving there just be relaxed
and happy the whole time that's gonna be
my goal today so it's kind of dreading
this drive to be honest but I'm gonna
download podcasts I'm wearing a comfy
friend sweater I'm gonna challenge
myself to be relaxed and happy
from this moment so sorry be like Tara
Mike I'm super sick right now but I just
did the meditation for the day today's
meditation is all about non-attachment
and basically it just talks about how we
become attached to the idea of things
and kind of create this condition in
which we will only be happier we will
only give ourselves love and acceptance
when we get that outside thing and so in
practicing like non-attachment we
basically go through the day and detach
kind of like your idea around those
things like for instance my oh like me
mind you is probably a good thing to be
attached to your health but even just
thinking like I'm not
miserable day because I'm sick no I'm
not sometimes being sick can be fun you
know like watching alone for the port
sizes here eating Thai soup and just
chilling in my kids so I don't
think that's exactly what it was going
for there I think it meant more
materialistic things but they see if the
only meditations actually helped so
there are these living the life of
awareness daily meditations from the
Toltec path where I told you about the
floor agreement and he basically takes
like the teachings of the floor
agreements and puts them into daily
meditations you can do to just like be
happier these aren't like meditations
these are like a little piece of
knowledge to start your day with and
then a practice that you go throughout
the day with this is the authentic self
make me nervous if you like you're gonna
cheer my favorite meditations that's
about that dig self is a term that
describes the living being that has the
capacity to engage life and then the
practice says with awareness remember
today that your authentic self is a
living being that gives life to your
body enabling you to perceive the
project life the enemy the side body of
your body is you thus your authentic
self and even just in one week I was
already starting to notice some change
so it is currently day seven in the
meditation challenge I'm officially one
week and I've been meditating every
single day for a week since I'm halfway
through I figured I'd give you guys a
little update and just kind of let you
in on basically my midway point one
thing that I have definitely noticed
since I've started meditating every day
is my outlook on not only just life but
like what is right in front of me my
present moment has changed drastically
being positive towards the future it's
even just taking the present for what it
is and not what I want it to be or what
I think it should be if that makes any
sense
over the last week every situation I've
been in I'm a lot more aware of it and
I'm a lot more in tune with it rather
than trying to manipulate it into what I
want it to be so that's like one of the
biggest things I've noticed a weekend I
definitely think it's helping the first
line of today's practice says remember
if you want to change the world the
first step is accepting yourself as you
are in this mode
and change with the freedom that life
gives you if you want to so the way I'm
seeing that is I'm accepting that I feel
sick that I feel exhausted and that I
had a couple speed bumps today but but
taking the freedom that life gives me to
you know go outside my dorm I'm choosing
to accept how I feel but change my
present reality and just go make the
most out of my night regardless make a
memory bring my camera realize that I'm
young time and life is short and I don't
waste it
today's meditation believing at your own
stories so something I've been trying to
do ever since I started reading these
meditations is after I read them I take
like 5-10 minutes to just sit and Mull
it over or if I find that I can't focus
on like what's happening I feel like I'm
not retaining much of it I'll write
instead so kind of like how Greg said in
the earlier clip where he was asking
like is it a sit down like lay down and
think or like clear your mind kind of
meditation you can sit in silence and
like clean your meditation it's kind of
whatever like the person makes it some
people might find like driving and Zen
ting out that way as meditation some
people might find journaling meditation
some people might find like sitting down
clearing the mind what like staring at
candles there's so many different ways
to meditate I've been kind of playing
around with a few of them
sometimes I'll journal after if I find
my like headspace a little too clouded
and reflect in right now or sometimes
I'll just lay and think about it with
that I'm going to read today's and see
what kind of meditation I'm feeling
again
like I mentioned on days where I felt
like things were a little bit more
overwhelming where I was a little bit
more busy or I couldn't seem to focus my
mind I would after reading this take the
practice and kind of write it into a
journal I especially found I did that
more so at the night time and other
times I would just read it and then sit
and kind of just think about it whether
it was with my morning coffee or just
sitting on the couch today is the last
and final day of the two weeks and the
change is actually very very substantial
even though this wasn't the standard
kind of meditations that I originally
thought it was going to be when I first
got into it I thought it was gonna be a
little bit more like uhm I almost like
this better because not that it
necessarily made me feel less stressed
but it made me feel more at peace
with my stress and at peace with the
reality of what my life is and not what
I want my life to be by the end of it I
had either come to terms with whatever
was bothering me or I had changed my
perspective on it to find a way that it
actually worked in my favor
everything from feeling better about
myself that day or even just feeling
more in control over my life and
basically my perspective of everything
is in a real lot of ways my reality of
everything I experienced a huge shift in
just how sure I felt of myself and how
good I felt about my life and that's
what only being two weeks in so now lets
you know enter into our rating scale
basically gonna sum up why I did the
challenge and the overall need or
necessity for this challenge then I'm
going to rate how well it worked on a
scale of 1 to 10 and lastly I'm going to
give a final rating over whether I think
it's something that we all should
integrate into our lives
so first things first I decided to do
the meditation challenge and
specifically this sanitation book
because one it's easy to carry with me
everywhere - it was a bit more guided
meditations versus just laying down and
trying to clear my mind sometimes I
struggle with those ones a bit more and
lastly I think on a scale of 1 to 10 I
was at probably a solid 7.5 in need of
trying out meditation and doing it on a
daily basis and forming that habit
second when it comes to how well I think
at work on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm going
to rate it a solid eight point five for
one reason even though they are daily
meditations I wish that the practices
were a bit more about sitting and kind
of letting a subconscious flow of
thought rather than just taking it into
your day maybe just start off each
meditation with five minutes of silence
or something I feel like that might make
it a little bit better because then
you're integrating both types of
meditation and that would be the only
reason why I give it an 8.5 I feel like
if you do like a five-minute clearing
the mind meditation and then do this
meditation following it it would be a
solid ten and lastly how much I would
rate it in terms of needing to integrate
it into your everyday life I'm gonna
give it a nine I don't think any of us
don't have problems and I don't think
any of us don't get roadblocks in our
minds that stop us from living our full
lives and stop us from feeling the best
about ourselves and the best about our
situations I think we all get attached
to ideas I think we all get attached to
superficial things and that none of that
is necessarily bad but I think it is
through being mindful being aware in the
present moment and also just taking the
time to kind of reflect on a daily basis
that I think we'd all be a little bit
more patient a little bit more kind and
also just a little bit more happy
without doing that without finding that
awareness on a daily basis or at least
as much as we possibly can then we end
up becoming these creatures that by the
end of our lives we look back and we
feel like we were in a fog the whole
time because we're always worried about
the past or we're always so focused on
the future that we're not becoming aware
of the present moment and aware of our
surroundings and aware of how we
perceive our surroundings to know how to
fix things so we end up feeling like it
all just kind of flashes by even
being a little bit more aware in the
day-to-day basis has made it easier for
me to enjoy the moments while they're
happening I can make this moment even if
I'm doing something that I necessarily
don't feel like doing enjoyable and so
it's for that reason that I give it a
solid nine out of ten and with that that
was the awareness meditations challenge
that I decided to do let me know if you
