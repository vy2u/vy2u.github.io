channel for today's video I am doing
another vlog with you guys considering
it it's Sunday
oddly enough I just had a weird
flashback that I'm pretty sure I was
wearing this sweater in the intro of the
last vlog as you can see it's been
making its rounds so for today's video I
wanted to do a bit of like a day in my
life
slash just day because there is a lot of
stuff I need to do today to kind of get
my together for lack of a better
word somebody else felt like hanging out
with you guys - what's up cutie Bentley
has been so needy all morning he keeps
on like barking scratching at my legs
just wants me to hold him and carry him
it's adorable but it's also like what do
you want I wish my dog could talk to me
just tell me what it is anyway for
today's video there's a bunch of stuff
that I need to catch up on like I
mentioned I'm pretty sure in my last
vlog at the end of my last vlog I've
been so busy like editing and answering
emails and filming videos that like a
lot of just the normal day to day life
stuff has kind of fallen behind you know
things as simple as putting on a face
mask shaving my armpits washing my
bedding I know that that's all really
gross but I mean it's okay sometimes you
have to just be a dirtbag to get
done you know for today's video I'm
going to catch up on a bunch of stuff we
are going to gist the crap out of today
so first things first I really need to
wash my bedding I dripped a bunch of
candle wax on it yesterday and I'm
praying it comes out I know that that's
a long shot but we're trying to try and
then after that I'm going to make myself
the best hottest most heaping cup of
coffee because God knows I need it so
without further ado grab your mugs take
a seat and let's begin
guys I know I've mentioned this before
but these dandies like vegan pumpkin
spice marshmallows and putting these in
my coffee every day it's been such a
game-changer so I just finished getting
ready I'm going to spend the first chunk
of my day getting kind of like the
annoying tasks done when I said this was
a Dana life
I really wasn't kidding this whole vlog
is pretty much the epitome of my recent
existence so because there's such a
large amount of videos that have been
uploading this month and a large amount
of videos that have been filming in such
I've been editing a video a day just to
keep on top of everything to make sure
that all the videos are done so I have
to edit a video today that's for two
days from now and I've been making sure
to just do that first thing in the day
so it's just done and I don't have to
worry about staying up late if I don't
get it done throughout the day so that's
normally the plan hence also why I
haven't changed yet I like to stay in
comfy clothes when I add it to it's just
like you just sit on your butt and stare
at a computer for two hours the one good
thing of doing it from the comfort of
your own home is being able to wear
literally whatever you want also the
other thing about all the filming I've
been doing lately guys I've been wearing
false lashes so much that there's a lot
of mascara on them right now but I need
to give my eyelashes a break so bad so
lately I've just been like popping these
on instead last night I also ordered
like a whole new huge stock of these
coming back to coast so that's also
really exciting moving forward every
time I go to edit I kind of have a bit
of like a routine for setting myself up
does I know I'm gonna be sitting down
and just kind of like head down for an
hour to I like to kind of get my vibe
going before I can actually focus it
sounds weird but it can be such a
struggle for me to focus sometimes that
I have to create such a cozy like you
know like good setting so if you've ever
wondered you know how I get ready to
edit
so that was actually perfect time had
just finished not only editing that
video but uploading that video and
making the thumbnail so I was actually
kind of a world record for two hours and
if you hear that beeping that would be
my laundry things are working out quite
nicely so next I'm gonna clean up my
little editing station and I have just
been feeling how do I explain this every
year around this time because of the
amount of excessive time I spent editing
filming and kind of just hanging out
alone because I work alone I start to
get this like weird feeling like I need
to change some things up and I got the
idea last night that I think I want to
change around my bedroom so before I do
anything else today and before I switch
into my clothes of the day while I'm
still in the comfort of sweatpants the
here guy had to come into my apartment
so I put pants on but while I'm still in
the comfort of these clothes I'm
thinking I'm gonna rearrange my bedroom
you know just get a fresh new clean
slate a new vibe for leading into
November
shall we dance
we were victims of the night the
chemical physical kryptonite to the base
and face
this isn't going quite as planned
this
just keep your eyes on me
so I'm now officially done rearranging
as you can see I mean I'm not gonna lie
it's not necessarily my favorite
arrangement of this apartment but I
needed a change I just switched into my
clothing or my outfit I'm just wearing
this white sweater that is from Orencia
I believe the brand though is Wilfred
free and then some jeans that I also got
from a ritzy abut they are Levi's and
I'm heading out to me a Greg at his
sister's house were actually babysitting
his little nephew hanging out with a
little baby for two hours is like
exactly what my soul needs right now so
buried after I'll be sure to pick up
where I left off as we go shopping this
day 20 of youtuber and Greg just
admitted that he's not watched for one
tell me what guess the most popular one
that you know it were do you know so
it's actually now the next day I didn't
end up vlogging too much last night
because after babysitting Greg and I
just grabbed some food but it was really
really good like middle eastern place it
was insane guys the hummus I can't even
and then after that we literally just
hung out and watched some TV I just
realized that we could have watched
Riverdale and we totally didn't that's
upsetting so all the things that I
basically didn't get done yesterday I'm
going to try and get done today
I'm currently heading to go shopping
need to finish my sister's gift I need
to get a new pair of slippers because my
slippers have ripped and I've been
meaning to get a new pair for so long
now and a few other things just because
it is like the last technical week the
fall so I want to embrace it as best I
can and I also am super under
caffeinated right now so that needs to
be the first thing that happens and then
basically I need to film a quick video
today and then I'm heading it to my
hometown so I'm not exactly sure where
this vlog might take us but
I mean down for the adventure of you are
she will go she will go far will shows
no no bring her down no okay I am in
such a rush today I'm just stuck in
traffic for like an hour driving in
Toronto I went okay normally I love to
drive don't get me wrong but the people
in Toronto when they're driving are so
savage they're so ruthless I'll show you
guys some of the stuff that I bought I
also think I went a little overboard
Esther is like just like the coolest
person I know she's also like my best
friend so I was one of those things I
was like I kept finding things that I
just had to get um bailey's came out
with an almond milk I tried to find that
orange scarf that you guys can see back
there that I got from forever 21 I tried
to find it everywhere and they're sold
out so I went and got her an orange one
from Urban Outfitters also the cardigan
that you guys saw that I have from Urban
Outfitters that's orange they didn't
have any smalls there's like a dusty
pink and so I got her this and then this
is hilarious this is just like one of
those really funny things that I might
ask her to give me one once she opens it
there's sriracha two goes and then I
also picked her up an insect's like one
of those PG film printable like instant
cameras I'm always kind of running at
her that she doesn't take very many
photos and that she's gonna want to like
make memories and have photos to look
back on as she gets older so planner for
2018 I got new slippers so I'll share
with you guys the new slippers that I
got I have been obsessed with those
reading socks that I've been wearing so
I went picked up a second pair these are
the ones that I got they're from indigo
and they are furry on the inside I took
my sister a pair as well and I got her
like the light ones and then for the
last little bit of her gift she's also
obsessed with puzzles and Harry Potter
so I got our Harry Potter puzzle Harry
Potter playing cards last but not least
her and her boyfriend are obsessed with
caesars if you guys are from Canada you
might not know what Caesar's are they're
like a Bloody Mary but on crack Connor
Caesar kit with the Caesar Rim
and have to show you guys really quickly
as I picked up unfiltered by Lily
Collins I've been wanting to pick up
this book for so long I actually love
her she's one of my favorite actresses
so so if you guys want me to review it
let me know I'm gonna put my sister's
gift together with some tissue paper and
such last time I was telling you guys
that my armpits were really hairy which
was probably TMI
like I said we're being that real my
legs have gotten out of hand even though
I have to leave for Kingston really
really soon I need to film a video but
before I do anything I need to like I'm
gonna put some coconut oil my hair and a
face mask on shave my face tan my body I
haven't put tanner on my body in so long
because like I said I'm just like
running behind on existing that's my
plan for the day fingers crossed I can
get all of that done and still leave
before rush hour for being optimist at
her would when the father would leave
her in this life for good she don't hurt
when the truth burns
she ain't cold when the seasons turn you
could never tell when his young girls
hurt she might have pain but doesn't
care to be heard she will go
she will go far will shows she carries
through her heart no one know
bring her down no one no one can stop
her now to stop her now
and stop her now you can stop her now
she will not fall she will go you will
go far
the will show tears through her heart no
one no bring her down
no one
they stop her now to stop her now
and stop her now it's nothing now
she will not fall
so obviously you guys now know from the
clips I am in my hometown I'm in
Kingston belly and I are just heading
out we're gonna go to Starbucks and grab
coffees because I am extremely under
caffeinated and very tired right now
it's pretty early in the morning it's
still only 9 a.m. since I've been here
we've done a ton of celebrations for my
sister's birthday there was vegan Oreo
cupcakes involved there was like there's
been so much food and festivities here
and I went to chapter today which I also
showed you guys and then last night we
went out for like a fancy dinner I
didn't vlog it but I did post a bunch to
snapchat and then this morning I woke up
super early because I need to edit I
think once you towbar ends I'm gonna
come and spend like a whole week in my
hometown because it's just been so nice
like hanging out with my family and just
being at home I feel like any of you
guys that maybe have moved away from
home or gone away to school might know
what I'm saying when it's just like
there's such a comforting feeling in
going back to your hometown and being
around like you know your friends and
your family and it's not even in a way
that makes you want to move home it's
just in a way that just like resets your
caliber does that make sense
I don't know I'm probably just rambling
can I get a grande skinny de cinnamon
Dolce latte made with coconut milk
please thanks I have just like this
weird feeling that so much is gonna
change soon and I feel like part of it
is out of my control which is just like
a whole other level of like life chats
that we could have but gonna be so nerdy
for me to admit this to you guys but I
feel like in some ways like the universe
is constantly sending us signs and I can
sense that some stuff is about to shift
and change and then in other ways I am
feeling like I want some shifts and some
changes hence moving around my room and
a bunch of other things the combination
right now of trying to get caffeinated
and trying to have light shots is
stressful and see if you can not Bart
can you be a good boy
thank you so much you too like I was
saying I just I don't know if it's the
time of year I don't know what it is but
I just feel some big changes coming mr.
Mendoza holidays everything oh my god
this tree these trees can you wish
witness how beautifully fall ask that
tree is funny story I'm actually driving
by my apartment that I lived in before
moving to Toronto okay so this apartment
used to be mine
this one on the corner this was my old
apartment those were like my bedroom
windows that was the second bedroom
window and that was the living room well
I think it's a little elderly couple
they're so cute I'm like mad creeping
I'm officially not a newbie to Toronto
anymore I just abandoned ship and within
like two to three weeks had decided it
was gonna happen
found a place packed up all my stuff and
left and so I honestly do believe that
that's kind of the best way to live like
when there's something you want to do
you got to make it happen sometimes and
not thanks too much you're over
complicate the process and that was
pretty much how I went about it but I
think that's why all of the sudden like
ten months later I'm like oh that
happened so quickly and I'm happy about
it and I love coming home to Kingston
and then driving out and going back to
Toronto because I do feel like Tonto is
my home now but I have this right I
don't know why but I get this weird
feeling of nostalgia like this time of
year and it kind of gets me thinking
about just like how fast five flies and
how I'm like super cautious of
constantly wanting to be on the right
track doing the right things making sure
I'm like making the right decisions and
it's just I think that's why I'm so
excited to just kind of shake things up
make some changes start working on some
things that I can't police say yet but I
want to say I don't know what this
turned into this turned into like a
random car life chat so that is it for
today's vlog I hope you guys enjoyed
honey bedding
a paid side of my day-to-day life
whether it's my life in Toronto or
coming to visit my hometown and just
like I don't know like recouping and
resetting my batteries in a way next
week's vlog is going to be so lit I
that's all I'm gonna say but it won't be
going up on Sunday it'll actually be
going up on Halloween there's that and
aside from that I love you guys doesn't
win them back thank you guys so much for
watching and hanging out with me in my
car I kind of I feel like we need to do
this more this feels kind of right in a
way feels like we're I like all on a
drive together anyway I'm rambling for
so long now I'm gonna go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
