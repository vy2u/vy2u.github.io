the president my friend is the first
lady my friend is the first way I am I'm
the secretary Peterson seriously I'm not
to get away from your parents and that's
all Wow who takes it in a job right now
I don't think so we can write this down
I don't know whatever I could I let you
fall by yourself
long way safer come on now easily
and go
together those
anything no sainted I would he just got
back from shopping so everyone Christine
you guys have seen her of multiple times
it's down visiting me right now and we
went out and did some shopping for food
I'm going to do like a vlog hall-style
thing I don't know I shall start with
for 20 months but so this is a shirt I
got from forever 21
it's got like the lacing of the front
and the gray it works and also we're
kind of shoulders which is super nice
that's all I got for everyone and then
hmm I only got one thing from H&amp;amp;M as
well this is like a bodysuit this is
what it looks like it's got like a blush
lining underneath and then it's got like
lace on top next we went to dynamite and
it picked up two different things from
here so this is a tank top I got it's
like soap the soap kind of material and
I really like the color of it it was
like a nice bra and then I got a pair of
pants so kind of like they're not jeans
they're not lagging the leg dress pants
that all at the same time they're not
dress pants I don't know how to explain
this material but they're kind of
stretchy and they're high-waisted so I
figured need to be really really cute
yes let's go I got from bad night and
then last but not least I'm gonna take
your Bourbon planet you would definitely
wear it was like a brawl that or like a
black bra underneath because completely
sheer but and then this shirt it's like
a blazer kind of but again I figured you
could wear with like a black bra let and
I like the bottom of it I feel like it's
going to be super flattering like a pair
of jeans on that is really black blazer
that I got I got this sweater that is
basically just like a cropped sweater
that has like a bunch of holes and like
rips and it lasted at least I bought
this jacket here which I think it'll be
really nice especially in the spring but
you'd have to wait for like a long sleep
because it's like a bat in it it's not
going to look good with my this isn't
even my shirt but my are you sure how
about you all the way it was great I did
graduate with honors and then I went
back for my PhD just kidding I don't go
to school I don't really know what else
update you guys on right now so we don't
really have a plan right now we were
like maybe we'll go to the gym it'll
actually be hilarious to see if that it
can happen

together

drove back to my hometown I was visiting
a bunch friends yesterday I went to
crave which is a place I've talked about

favorite place to get coffee in my
hometown because they do peanut butter
