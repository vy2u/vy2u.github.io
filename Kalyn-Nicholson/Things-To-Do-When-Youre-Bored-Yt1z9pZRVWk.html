be giving you guys some ideas of things
to do when you're bored with summer
break coming up or whether it's just the
weekend or you have some time off no
matter what it is sometimes we get into
those moods where we just don't know
what to do and we're really bored keep
in mind these are some of the things
that I like to do when I'm bored so this
might not be for all of you guys but be
sure to leave down below what you guys
like to do in you're bored or what your
favorite thing was from the video so
without further ado keep watching to
find it some things to do when you're
bored so one of the things that I like
to do when I'm bored is make a playlist
now that might sound weird but you can
do this on a tracks or Pandora or just
on your iTunes and I'll just do all
different types of styles based on how
I'm feeling that day and what my mood is
so I did make a new playlist and I'll
leave it down below for you guys the
next thing I like to do is after I make
a playlist I'll usually blare it really
loudly and then do something like sketch
or just do some art or just something
fun to keep my mind busy and this is
something that I kind of like to do are
mandalas so I kind of just make it with
a pencil first because I'm a bit of a
perfectionist and I don't like to do it
just strictly with the marker but then
you just make all these fun intricate
designs and you can do it in the form of
flowers or elephants or however you like
and then another thing I like to do
while I Blair my new playlist is just
clean so I actually cleaned out my
closet the other day and it might not
sound that fun but trust me if you have
your music blaring and you just clean
and organized it can really be more fun
than you think and it kind of helps you
clear your mind
so this might sound silly but another
thing I like to do when I'm bored is
kind of stock up on some Instagram
pictures so I'll just kind of play
around with things on my desk or on my
bed or outfits and I'll just kind of
snap a couple photos and just have fun
like putting filters on them and such
and then just keeping them in a folder
for keepsake if I'm ever bored or don't
really have anything to post that day
then though that is what I will post so
in case you guys were wondering this is
usually my little setup for my Instagram
photos so I do like to stock up and you
guys can do it too you can stock up and
pick a theme and really have fun and
make your Instagram more fun and bright
and colorful
and as many of you guys already know I
do love to read so this is something I
suggest doing if you're bored -
especially if you're not a big reader
try picking up a new book or look up
some new books I do have book related
videos on my second channel and just try
it even if it's not something you would
normally do I promise you guys reading
is probably one of my favorite pastimes
when I'm bored
and of course if reading isn't your
thing you could always just browse the
Internet so I like to look up blogs and
such that was just the life with list
blog and I'll leave her blog down below
as well as things like we heart it which
is like an inspirational platform for
pictures and I'm on there as well so
I'll leave that link down below too so
those are just a few of my favorite
websites to go on when I'm bored and if
you're getting sick of the computer you
could also make a life bucket list so
that is a really big daunting task and
it usually can take a couple hours so
really have fun and write down all the
things that you want to do before you
kick the bucket and then if that doesn't
take you as long as you thought you
could pull at your laptop or computer
and start researching or making plans to
actually knock some of those things off
the bucket list itself and if all else
fails you could do what we normally all
probably do which is just binge watch
Netflix which is normally my go to when
I am extremely bored and lately I've
been loving Grey's Anatomy so be sure to
comment down below what shows you've
been loving lately
I'm with you so there you have it now
you guys know exactly what I like to do
when I'm bored if you guys like this
video thumbs it up and I can do a part
too and other than that I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys
on the next one bye guys
you need to cut the cord at least for 10
minutes while I film or just sit down on
me that works too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
