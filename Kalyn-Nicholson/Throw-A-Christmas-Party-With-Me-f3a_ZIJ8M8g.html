hey guys and welcome back to my channel
today's video I actually teamed up with
PayPal to bring you guys a how-to for
throwing a Christmas party this holiday
season we're gonna cover all the basics
from picking out gifts for your friends
to picking out decor inspo a for your
place as well as outfit ideas and makeup
for the big day so without further ado
if you guys want to see my tips tricks
and how to's for throwing a holiday
party this year then just keep watching
so first and foremost you're gonna want
to start by obviously decorating your
place for the holiday party or even just
for Christmastime in general this year I
decided to go it's kind of like a red
black silver and white rustic cabin
theme and then I also added a bunch of
super cozy lighting to go around just to
create that kind of like holiday
atmosphere but some other ideas of like
themes you guys could go for for your
party or just for decor in general you
could do like a winter wonderland theme
of all white you could do evergreen
themes with like green and red there's
literally just so many different options
for decor when it comes to decorating
for the Christmas season and in terms
for throwing the party it's also a
really smart idea to to pick up some
nice holiday dishware and like serving
dishes and stuff tie in the whole party
with the atmosphere that you've created
in your home so obviously I picked up
all of my stuff on a line and the
amazing thing about using a PayPal for
this is that there's millions of stores
you guys can choose from so finding
decor that fits your theme from all
different stores is going to be super
easy for you guys to do and you can do
it
so I picked up a bunch of decor for my
party this year and if you guys want to
find any of it again I'm going to leave
it links down below to everything
but next when it comes to throwing a
holiday party it's always really fun to
make sure that you pick up some gifts
for your friends to go home with at the
end of the night so the added benefit of
shopping for all of your friends gifts
online is that you can do it right from
your couch and you guys know how much I
don't like to leave my couch plus it
involves skipping all of the holiday
lines and the hectic craziness that
happens at the mall some of the things
that I picked up for gifts and possibly
some ideas for you guys are things like
mugs books you could pick up like a
coffee press possibly any sort of scarf
or poncho if you're shopping for a
boyfriend or a guy you could pick up
things like video games or even things
like a Fitbit if you want to splurge a
little bit as well as just things like
sweatpants books basically anything that
you could give it to your guests to walk
away with at the end of the night
I think no good food and last but not
least a finding the perfect look for
your holiday party is so essential as
for the dresses I picked them up at
Topshop if you guys happen to buy your
dresses a through PayPal they do a
return shipping on us where they will
foot the bill for sending it back if
it's either the wrong size or you happen
to change your mind so if you guys want
I can do a completely separate video
showing you guys like the hair and
makeup look that I did so the first
outfit that I ended up picking up was
kind of more of like a black outfit
because duh when do I ever wear color
that said I did pick up a nice red dress
this year too cuz I feel like a classic
red dress is just so key for any sort of
holiday party and using PayPal to shop
for all these things online is super
easy because you don't need to
constantly put it in at your shipping
and billing information all you need is
your username and password so that was
it for my holiday how-to first sorrowing
a Christmas party this year if you guys
decide to try out any of the tips and
tricks and throw your own Christmas
party be sure to tweet and Instagram
those at me and also leave a comment
down below letting me know what you guys
are asking it for for Christmas this
year as Matt I hope you guys enjoyed and
I'll see you guys all in my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
