just don't know everybody smile at you
everywhere you go it's like got that
secret that everybody else wants to know
hey guys so for today's video I am going
to be sharing with you guys some tips
and tricks that I have learned that have
helped me deal with my anxiety in my on
and off depression I actually uploaded a
video to my coffee talk channel or my
second channel and I'll leave the link
to it down below but it's basically more
so a background story of just my
experience with dealing with anxiety and
depression I didn't really want to put
it up on my main channel so instead I
decided to do this video that was in
relation to it just because this one is
a little bit more positive and it's more
so ways and trip ways tips and tricks to
deal with these types of things and
these tips and tricks aren't only just
for people that might suffer from
anxiety and depression these are also
tips and tricks that might just help you
if you're having a bad day or if you're
going through a rough time or a weird
phase in your life these might help you
as well so if you guys want to know the
tips and tricks that I have then just
keep watching
revelant your hair
one of the first things I like to do is
make a playlist or have a go to songs
for when I'm feeling just down and sad
so I actually collected all of my go-to
songs and put them in a playlist and
I'll leave the link to it down below the
other thing I like to do is either talk
it out with somebody or if I don't
really feel like talking to somebody or
if there's nobody around then I like to
write how I'm feeling it just helps get
everything out on paper and out of my
head and if you need a journal this is
the little DIY journal that I made for
myself and I'll show you guys how I made
it
all I did was print out some of my
favorite inspiring pictures from We
Heart It or you could get them off of
tumblr and then I just printed them all
out and I cut up cut them all up and
match them with different scrapbooking
stickers and such and then I used cement
glue to just secure everything onto the
journal in whatever pattern I was really
the best part is making yourself a
journal as you can make it as
personalized as you like and put
pictures all over the front that inspire
you and then you have somewhere to go
and just write when you're feeling down
or even when you're feeling happy or
just to write your goals in you could
really write or do whatever you'd like
in your journal so that is the journal
that I ended up making and if you're not
really feeling like writing you could
always just design a little inspo page
inside your journal or you could put
this on like a bristol board and hang it
up on your wall just collect a bunch of
pictures that make you feel happy
pictures of your friends pictures of
people that are important to you
pictures of your accomplishments or
places you've traveled to and just
collect them all and collage them onto a
piece of paper or onto a bristol board
and hang it up and then you can look at
it whenever you're feeling down or you
can just do the craft itself to get your
mind off of feeling stressed or anxious
one of the biggest tips I found his help
me is exercising especially doing
something like running as well as a yoga
so I've been getting really back really
into doing yoga again and meditation so
if you can't find a yoga class you could
do yoga from YouTube at home I'll leave
some of my favorite yoga links down
below and of course if you're going to
be doing yoga another thing you should
try is meditation so this is my favorite
app when I want to meditate and no I'm
not being sponsored by the app I
actually just really liked it so you
choose the background noise and you can
just have it background noise or you can
have it mixed and matched with a
background noise and then someone's
speaking overtop of it just kind of like
encouraging you to meditate and just
talking very peacefully but you can
choose just the noises itself and this
is really good for helping find your
Center and another huge tip that's
helped me is using a day planner or a
schedule on my calendar just keeping
ahead of schedule has taken so much
stress out of my life and made it so
that I'm never wondering if there's
something I'm forgetting to do or
something that I need needs to be done I
always know and of course reading some
inspiring nonfiction
I'll leave a list of my favorites down
below and even just having like 15
minutes to read or 15 minutes to do
something that's just for you that you
enjoy it makes a world of a difference
too so I suggest scheduling some time
out to do something that takes your mind
off of the day-to-day stress and last
but not least have something symbolic
that you can have on you that will kind
of bring you back to reality if you're
feeling anxious or sad or stressed out
or worried so I ended up making little
bracelets and you can pick out colors
that are symbolic to you I looked up
spiritual colors and the virtues that I
wanted to get from this bracelet and
those are the colors that I picked out
I'll leave a link to the spiritual color
list down below and for this one I
decided to do a little chevron pattern
because the arrows are pointing forward
meaning to just keep going so I used all
different colors and what you're going
to want to do is take the outside color
create a backwards four all the way and
do two knots each time until you get the
same colors in the center and then once
you have the same colors in the center
you're going to want to not the same
colors twice you'll notice what I'm
doing here I'll leave a link to a more
descriptive tutorial down below but this
is basically how I did it and then
you just keep going with each outside
colors start nodding them towards the
inside and then once you have both
colors on the inside not them both so
you can make all different types of
bracelets with all different types of
colors and I'm going to be making
bracelets with every single piece of
yarn that you see here and then I'm
going to be giving them all away so if
you guys want to figure out how to add
get into this giveaway just go ahead and
look down below to win a bracelet just
like this one and I'm also going to be
giving away two journals so the journal
that I made in this video I'm going to
be giving that one away as well as
another one so look down below to find
out how to win those so thank you guys
for watching and I hope these tips help
some of you and I'll see you guys all in
a future video
it's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
