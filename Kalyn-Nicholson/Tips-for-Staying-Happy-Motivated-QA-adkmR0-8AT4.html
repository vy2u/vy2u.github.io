to my channel for today's video I am
going to be doing a Q&amp;amp;A with you guys
I've recently posted to Instagram this
photo right here and I asked you guys to
leave your questions down below and you
guys asked some really wicked questions
this time so I'm super excited to answer
them if you guys aren't following me on
Instagram or Twitter already I will
leave them right here so you guys can do
so if you're on a computer you can click
right on them and it will take you there
and other than that let's just jump in
because I've got a lot of questions to
answer
so what Duncan's asks what is your
favorite season um fall ester kegs asks
favorite youtuber or TV show this
changes all the time and really obsess
with pretty little liars lately how to
get away with murder is also a really
good show that I recently watched Frozen
Planet oddly enough that sounds weird
but I watched Frozen Planet religiously
and then after I finished it they came
up with all of these like spin-offs from
frozen planet where it's like the making
of frozen planet and it's like frozen
planet on thin ice and like yeah I watch
every single one of them don't be sucky
asks how tall are you and I am 5 foot 5
and like 3/4 I'm noticing that there's a
big theme of questions in terms of
writing dreamcatcher and like how I
write it and all of that stuff if you
guys would like me to do like a whole
separate video all about writing my book
then it just sums us up I can go into
all of those details about like how I
came up with the characters how I write
it plot development all of that type
thing if you got some want me to do that
then just to let me know down below or
thumbs up this video and I can make a
completely separate video about like how
I wrote dreamcatcher so brandy rebel
eyes asks five places that you would
like to visit in the next year well one
is New York I really want to go to
Lan's I think Tyler it would be really
cool Greece Australia or New Zealand one
or the other or both let's just let's
just say both and okay this is going to
be weird but it's not necessarily a
place it could be a bunch of different
places but one of the biggest things on
my bucket list since I was a kid was to
see the Northern Lights so the 5th and
final place would be to see the Northern
Lights I'm not sure exactly where I want
to do that yet
so Megan hold fir I'm sorry if I
butchered your guys's names asks uh what
is your biggest tip on staying focused
on the journey and process - positivity
and happiness so that you don't get
sidetracked love you first of all I love
you too and second of all Exide in my
how to live your dream life I feel like
one big thing is I'm a very visual
person so making like a dream board so
that whenever I am feeling you know off
or you know negative or anything like
that I can see my dream board and it
kind of just re reminds me where I'm
trying to get so that I don't get lost
in the day-to-day things or like
energies and things like that sometimes
you are just going to be in a bad mood
so it's okay to just let yourself feel
it out get it out of your system so that
it's not always just kind of lingering
in the background like striving to take
over so if you're interested if I'm you
just let yourself be in a bad mood you
can't be happy positive eccentric every
single day you just have to kind of go
with the flow and another big tip to you
would be to have certain things you do
that that reek licks you so for me like
again I know I've mentioned this a
million times before but I noticed too
when my mindset starts to get super
negative or if I'm noticing that that
I'm starting to slip I'll listen to you
are a badass or even just like meditate
and meditating can even just be as
simple as sitting upside taking it all
in and just letting your thoughts kind
of flow until you feel like you've
thought everything else and just yeah so
those are be my biggest tips in terms of
staying on course for life and for
staying positive so Kara when I got a
switch your favorite autumn scent and I
believe my favorite autumn scent would
have to be either leaves or autumn by
Bath and Body Works both of those are my
favorites like I
nobody choose between the two if I had
to but absolutely had to autumn so a
Linoone lineage asks how to maintain a
night / morning routine and keep
yourself organized
I admire your discipline and I struggle
to maintain a consistent routine like
yours PS you're amazing stay that way
you are the sweetest thank you so much
it's actually on my list of video ideas
to do how to like get yourself into a
night routine or into a morning routine
like an organized version or how to get
yourself started on one instead of just
showing you mine so if that's something
you guys want to see it let me know down
below and I can just do a whole video on
that I'll do a part 1 and part 2 night
and morning
so again just let me know if that's what
you guys want to see it's a radical
hippie asks how do you deal with anxiety
and depression the biggest thing for me
is taking care of myself I notice that
when I stop taking care of my body when
I stop doing things that are fun for me
or relaxing or whatever when I start
self-sabotaging in that aspect that's
when I know that I'm starting to get
into a ride and so one is to definitely
just take care of yourself even if you
don't feel like it wake up get up show
up do it work out Epperly my first tip
and my second one is to find something
that gives you purpose find something
that you love to do that's just for you
and for me that's definitely youtube
anything that gets you excited about
life rip it to your knuckles are white
and never let it go whatever gets you
like all giddy about life just do that
sotae dot Nicole asks any advice for
getting over heartbreak I actually
filmed a video before that is all about
getting over heartbreak and breakup so
I'll leave something on the screen
somewhere where you can click that and
go watch that you own s7 496 asks your
favorite song my favorite song changes
pretty much every single day I'll tell
you three songs that will always be
favorites one of them is anchor by Nova
amor the second one is Georgia by Vance
joy and the third one is when summer
comes around by Keith Urban's like I can
listen to them no matter what mood I'm
in
and just feel some type of way you know
Rihanna Robinson asks if you can develop
one trait that you don't already have
what would it be that's a good question
and just that personality trait of being
able to talk to literally anyone or they
can walk into a room and just be friends
with like everyone and anyone and talk
to anyone and they're like they get
right up they ask her some questions
they can like touch somebody's shoulder
like give them hugs and stuff like that
and I'm just sitting there like blown
away because I'm I'm not as introverted
as I like to believe that I am I
actually I did pretty well with like
introducing myself and such but I
definitely hold back a little bit until
I get more comfortable around people and
I wish I was somebody that could just
walk into a room and be best friends
with anybody like I guess I genuinely
love those types of people and I wish
that's a trait that I could just create
within myself Oh Holly Melissa asks how
do I stay happy when my mama is always
shouting at me and calling me useless
and weird really sorry that that's
something that happens to you and the
only advice I can give you is to not
take it personally and I know that
that's a really hard thing to do and
this goes for any of you guys watching
if anybody ever says anything that hurt
your feelings or attacks you or makes
you feel bad about yourself
the best piece of advice I can give you
is that it's them not you
we're not useless you are not weird
you're not anything that anybody says of
you a lot of the times when people lash
out like that and and they get mean and
derogatory towards people it's usually
because they're unhappy within
themselves nobody's perfect
everybody's just trying to make their
way through life and deal with their
emotions and their feelings and not all
of us are best equipped to do so and so
the first thing we try and do is to beat
others down because we feel beat down
try and remember that it's not you it's
them MDD Frank asks what was your first
job you ever had and how old were you
the first job I ever had I was 15 years
old I got a job as a dietary aide at an
old-age home
I loved it like I definitely complained
about the hours and such because I was
15 and and whatever and I did it to the
time
18 but it was like this little mini home
that I had away from high school and I
loved I loved the residents there they
were so kind and sweet and you actually
start to like grow fond of these people
and they get excited to see you when you
would work it was an amazing job I mean
I definitely took it for granted but
looking back now I loved it there amy

Nick Harris 6 asks top things you look
for in a guy first of all I like really
easygoing down-to-earth
type thing and then the second thing is
Drive like I'm definitely without a
doubt attracted to people that have like
Drive and passion definitely a very
passionate person and I feel when I get
really into things I get very driven and
passionate about them and they believe
in something that's just for them and
they love that because I think for me I
found that in light so it's definitely
something that I would say I would look
for in a guy so just to be you know
well-rounded down-to-earth and also just
driven and passionate about whatever
they do so those are the questions that
I'm going to answer today I'm sorry if I
didn't get to your guys's question there
was like so many on there this won't be
the only Q&amp;amp;A there will be more so don't
worry it there will be a chance to ask
again and other than that I will see you
guys all in my future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
