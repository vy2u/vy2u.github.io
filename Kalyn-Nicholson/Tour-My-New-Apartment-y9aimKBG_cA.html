want to do an apartment tour with you
guys because I've been promising it
pretty much since I told you guys I was
moving the mind I'm not completely done
decorating my place yet it's pretty much
finished like it's complete but there's
a video coming up you guys we'll talk
about it later
so without further ado if you guys want
to tour my place then just keep watching
ok so when you first walk into my
apartment you'll see the same doormat
that I had for my last apartment tour
which if you guys haven't seen I will
pop somewhere else on the screen here so
it's the same doormat it is from
society6 and the right side the first
entranceway is where it is closeted
sotomayor closet here and inside edges
peek my to go to winter jacket that
means little traffic flow and walking in
my hat my leash my go to purses things
like that on my shopping bags and then
yeah but super boring stuff and then
what do want in the first thing you see
is my kitchen and living room area and
then starting up with my kitchen on the
top of the counter here I just like to
keep a candle burning and then press
that is my dishwasher we have my sink
itself that I'm using right now it's the
kitchen women and women aside I have
many popular machines which you guys
will probably remember for my last
apartment tour I'm going to decide that
they just a bunch of covers I mean if
you guys want me to do an actual kitchen
tour I can do that but it really could
be super boring here I just happy warm
tobacco-pipe and I got this from home
sentence pretty much burned but I like
the jar of it so I'm going to keep it
off to the side I have like my Keurig
with my mug in it if you guys remember
this from my apartment last department
store let me know but this is like a
wooden relaxing that Meigs and I stole
from a restaurant once and then I have
this hit me with your best pot coffee
press microwave
yeah the same old and then on the top of
my fridge I just have pictures from the
photo booth at B studio 71 in LA and
this is where she
where are you Katie so this is my
manager tape any of you guys know her
from my blogs and stuff like that so I
keep those pictures there because that
was from my la trip if you guys didn't
see the vlog I'll pop it up on the
screen somewhere
I've got my notes inside microd totally
super boring I have wine spinach some
meal prep always melt all the boring
things okay and then next to my kitchen
is my living room area so let me do a
full overview 35 all friends explain the
layout and then we'll go into detail
this door here is actually the doorway
to my office slash closet room this is
the bathroom
this is like the laundry which you got
to see in an ink here is my bedroom so
just so you guys I'm very confused for
the store it just has tools here but I
got rid it like my sign and people took
up way too much space and then off this
side we have another mirror I always
take with my snapchats on the front of
this one that did the string lights all
around it I'll show you guys what that
looks like right now plugged in and I
decide that I just have my nightstand
for the living room it's got this like
blow-up Eiffel Tower a tobacco and oak
candle and then this lamp I believe is
from Target and then underneath I just
have got nice toy box and my charger for
my xbox controllers of course we have my
couch basically this area is pretty much
the thing for my last apartment but
Robbie is drawn like yeah coffee table
is from Ikea
coach system I feel pretty much
everything all my coaches from society6
and then my tapestry from society6 and I
just strung some wire laying around it
on top of my coffee table I have these
fake flowers from home scents and my
laptop because I was working on getting
patch art over to the side I have my
fireplace and my TV on top it currently
a Grey's Anatomy on sitting here this is
also the view that you get a
my leg duty room in my office but let's
finish this area first okay just put
this vase here with fake flowers in it
and then once you're over off to the
other side this is where I keep my
laptop charging all the time so this is
just like a cute little sitting area
where you can like look outside and I
have my record player all of my records
my I love you to the moon back pillow
and then like a lantern with the candle
in it yeah it's just like a cute little
seating area I really want to get
something to put above it I'm thinking I
wanted to do like a bunch of Polaroids
of just like black-and-white photos or
me and all my friends or something out
of them and then I have one of my patio
so this one has my dining room set on it
because I think this one has cemented
you guys will see the other one
afterwards and the Chubby's white sheer
I'll go into my office room first so
this is the one of the bedrooms I'm in a
two bedroom I have this like hook thing
on the door that had my hat my room
basically everything from my last
department store and then when you first
look in there's my guitar definitely was
obviously ripping out the rug and it's
literally from Bentley scratching at me
really really pretty firmly so when you
first walk in I'll give you a full
overview so starting on this side I have
my closet sectional from my old
apartment from Ikea if you guys are
curious and this one here has life
jackets
everything from jackets to like nicer
tops and then my black collection of
boobies and then underneath I have these
are all pants and jeans and then those
are tops and sweaters and then off to
the other side that in most of quick
casual sweaters and like basically non
fancy tops and then this one has skirts
in it and then we have all of like my
tan and taupe colored booties and then
up here we just have like all of my in
season dresses I guess and then when you
turn off to the left a little bit I have
my bookshelf full of my shoes again you
guys will remember this from my last
department store and then the letters
from when I went to the trial Film Fest
with L'Oreal they put these in my hotel
room which was so cool so I kept them
and it
however bookshelves also assign me up
Emily's igloo because if I'm in here but
Lee needs to be in here I have my
cubicles on each side of my desk this
one I still have to find something to
fill the last little cubby here but not
like my makeup brushes my makeup bag a
cute pair of shoes my blanket scarves
and with a mirror and then I just have
this little thick plan dude on top of it
that area which again I was pretty much
seeing a lot of this a crystal that's
like this guy changes color and then
just like people read I have my agenda
which I will also leave a link to down
below bergamot and push the celli
whatever candles yes for my aunt Carrie
other cubicle I have all of my perfumes
vintage camera or lamp book and like
workbooks a makeup bag and then these
are like these are a pair of shoes I got
that I have never worn and I think I
want to save them for my wedding day and
then if I'm on the very top I just have
all of my workbooks and Taylor Swift's
CDs random stuff in the front or circuit
so I got this from Walmart because I
know it's a commonly asked question the
bookends are from Walmart and then off
to the side of that is the last cubicle
this is also for Mike eh just a thinner
one this time I didn't end up putting
the bar in what it actually done is just
put like hooks and all the holes to use
it to what hang up purses and belts and
scarves
I'm not crazy that accessories but the
little one little bit of accessories
that I do I put in here I have all of
like my clutches extra bags and then
this pile here is a pile of clothes
that's for a video that's coming up so
any time I have anything video related
it's usually in this little cubby here
then I have all my flat shoes underneath
my closet is a bit of a gong show it's
super messy but it's because I'm doing
I'm going to be doing a reorganizational
challenge coming out with you guys and
this will be one of the closets but I'm
going to be reorganizing drawers with
like no makeup and but lot of stuff in
here DIY stuff just a bunch of like
basically work for me
related things people always like my
camera equipment and stuff and my
polaroid these are all the jackets and
sweaters and maybe stuff that aren't in
season or that I'm not totally obsessed
with these are like the back-up plan but
I'm coming back out of my office I will
show you guys the other side of the
apartment so following along just over
here two guys missed it I have the three
clocks from my old apartment again you
guys will probably remember that and
then that means those whose dishes

object so I'm just going to get this one

the bathrooms there's two lockers in my
place and turn the light on and I have
vanilla soap in here you know just all
the boring stuff towel shower I like
this bathroom because it's got like
marble in it and I don't know I'm
obsessed with marble and then this bad
boy which has been in every single tour
I've ever done because my dad actually
bought this for me when I was away for
college so I thought it was me too like
every single apartment I've lived in and
then I have a candle that matches it
it's a mint and lemon so yeah super
boring stuff in here and then this is my
bedroom ended up getting a new bed if

drawers underneath this is just a really
low platform bed because I want my bed
to be close to the ground so my bed is
actually from Best Buy and then my
