today it's officially day fourteen of
you Tober and for today's video I'm
going to be doing another fall haul with
you guys I recently picked up some
things from a few stores including
forever 21 Charlotte Russe Oppo I'm also
going to show you guys the dress that I
got for Halloween if you aren't
following me already I'm going to leave
my Twitter and my Instagram right here
on the screen you'll probably see these
outfits they are first before you'll see
them on my channel so be sure to come
follow me since I have put a few things
to show you guys let's jump into the
hall so first and foremost I'm going to
show you guys this dress that I got from
show poem absolutely obsessed that you
guys will have seen it in my lookbook
video this is the dress here it's kind
of like a sweater material and it's got
a really baggy turtleneck and then it
goes down into a flare dress as I'm so
obsessed the fit of this I'll do a
cutaway clip here show you guys what it
looks like on it's honestly just
adorable for fall it's so cute it's so
cozy so next I'm gonna share with you
guys the things that I got from forever
21 starting with this shirt if you guys
haven't noticed yet I'm wearing a Justin
Bieber shirt like can we just take a
second
so this is actually from forever 21 I
purchased it along with the other things
that I'm going to be showing you guys in
this haul and then when I got here I
just kind of like held it up against my
body and cropped it I've been like
obsessed with cropping my shirts and
sweaters lately yeah this is my new
casual Justin Bieber shirt and if I can
find the link to it I believe it down
below so the next thing I got from
forever 21 was this black Bell sleeved
cropped it's super cute it's actually
really really nice material sleeves are
bell sleeves and then it's just I'd like
a slit up the back not exactly sure what
bro I'm going to wear with this yet but
to be determined so the next thing I got
was this skirt here and I've been
wanting a skirt this color for a long
time and I'm super particular on the way
I wanted it to look so I picked up this
one from forever 21 it's actually denim
material
it was $22.90 I had buttons going down
the front as well as pockets and this is
just like the perfect ball skirt really
glad I found one that was like
relatively affordable because I've been
really wanting a skirt like this and I
also picked up this lace dress from
forever 21 as well it's
completely lazy you would have to wear
some sort of like under layer I'm
thinking I'll probably wear it with a
black crop top and like high-waisted
black shorts underneath it's got an
adorable ribbon that bows down the front
so my next purchase from forever 21 is
this cropped turtleneck sweater it's not
going to look very good on camera so
I'll just put up a cutaway clip kind of
like a wooly material but it is not well
it's in the color mode and I just like
the way this fit I think it'd be super
cute with like a tight skirt underneath
eye high socks or you could wear it with
high-waisted jeans and again I've just
been obsessed with cropped sweaters
lately if you guys can't tell so the
next dress I actually picked up from
forever 21 is this one here I actually
got it more so in store for like the
holiday season and I figured I'd show it
in this haul because it is on the
website now but it's this green like
velvet sort of corduroy type of material
and it's one of those over the knee like
tighter body con dresses again like I
said I have some ideas for this for the
holiday season so you guys will be
seeing that very very soon well not too
soon it's not even Halloween yet but you
know what I mean and then the last thing
I picked up from forever 21 is this
skirt here again it's one of those like
tighter at the tops and then it just
kind of a lines it's not necessarily a
skater or a body con skirt it's got this
like lace top detailing it's super kind
of like grungy and I'm just loving it
and it's like a fake suede material
again if I can find the link I'll put it
down below I realized the other day when
I was looking through my closet that I
actually don't have like a good backup
go to like black tight dress so so I
figured I'd get one from forever 21
because it's relatively cheap this dress
was only twenty dollars and ninety cents
and I just feel like it's a really
really good staple to have in your
closet so now moving into Charlotte
Russe one of the first things I have to
show you guys is this jacket that I got
I didn't really have a good jacket or
like trench coat for the Falls coats are
one of those things that I always been
really iffy about buying online because
you never know what they're gonna look
like in person but this coat literally
ended up being so much better than I
thought it was going to be this is what
it looks like it's kind of like I don't
even know it's like trench coat material
this is the first coat I have that
actually goes down to my knees and I
absolutely love it I'm definitely going
to be wearing this so much this fall and
probably this winter too
so the next thing I got from shellers is
also a new favorite of mine and it is
these boots they're so flippin adorable
and now that it's fall it's actually
been raining a lot more and I saw these
on the website and I
we fell in love actually I originally
saw the blue ones and I was like all
those are so cute but I wish they have
them in black and that when I kept
scrolling God answered my prayers so I
purchased them I'm absolutely obsessed
though I think they're so cute and I
have a pair of rubber boots but they're
more like knee-high so I thought it
would be cute to add a little ankle pair
two of my closet this fall they're just
adorable and the insides plaid and
everything about them it just makes me
so happy so the second pair of booties
that I have to show you guys from
Charlotte Russe are these ones here
here's the funny story about these boots
I actually purchased them in burgundy
and they sent them to me in gray and
they were like oh it's gonna take up to
two weeks you just have to send them
back to us which I needed these for a
video so I wasn't going to have time to
every time something gray pops into my
life it's just very symbolic I think
it's kind of interesting that I got them
in gray and last but not least I picked
up this top here from Charlotte Russe
it's just this like cropped bust ei or
bust year or whatever you want to call
it I actually bought this in terms of
two different videos I have in mind but
again it's on the website right now so
any of you guys like it I figured I'd
show it in this haul so that you guys
don't miss out on purchasing it so next
I'm going to share with you guys the
dress that I recently picked up from
Lulu so this dress is actually my dress
for Halloween's not going to tell you
guys what my costume is but this is the
dress that I purchased for it so yeah
it's just like flared it at the bottom
and it's got shorts underneath which is
nice because it is quite short and the
material of it is amazing I'm just I'm
so glad I saw this online I was like yes
it'll fit my costume perfectly and then
the other thing that I picked up from
Lulu's with it is this choker here I'm
so behind on the choker game guys like
this is the first choker I think I've
ever purchased so that is everything I
have to show you guys for this fall haul
I hope you guys enjoyed let me know down
below which item from this entire haul
was your favorite then like a recent
goal of mine to kind of like branch out
and push myself to kind of be more bold
with my style and wear things that I
really really want to wear but like I
kind of get like afraid to or whatever
if you guys know of any stores that you
think I might like let me know down
below because I'm looking to shop at
some new places and other than that I'm
going to go put on some Bieber clean up
this mess and I'll see you guys all in
tomorrow's video
my mother takes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
