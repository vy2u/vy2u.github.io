Christmas right now like fall is life I
know sometimes you wanna go and Gabe you
know eonni ru hey guys so for today's
video I am doing a fall haul as you guys
know fall is my favorite season it's so
much an inspiration from fall I don't
know why I just love it so much I was in
such a foul mood the other night I was
burning all my fault candles like
drinking my nutmeg and cinnamon coffee
and I went on a crazy shopping spree but
as always if I share it with you guys
everything that I bought that I feel a
little less guilty about all the money I
spent without further ado let's jump in
because this probably would be a long
video I have a lot of clothes to show
you guys and how can I forget
it's a Tryon yeah I did it for you guys
don't you worry guys got you all hooked
up okay I'll start with Victoria's
Secret just because there's only two
things to show you guys from there and
they're just workout related so I always
like every single season to get either
like a new workout top or a new workout
pant or something like that because I
find when I do that every season I'm not
constantly buying me workout clothes
having like a new workout top for the
season it just inspires you to stay fit
you know so the top that I got from
Victoria's Secret is this one here it's
just like grey speckled it says vsx and
then the back has like half mesh I love
gray you guys are gonna notice that
there's like no color in this video and
also I picked up a new sports bra from
that so I just got a normal black one
like this it does have like a hook in
the back and I do like these ones
because they're not padded but they're
lying you can work out without having
pancake movies because nobody wants
pancake movies let's get real and next
I'm going to share with you guys all of
the stuff that I picked up from show
pouch Oppo is seriously one of my
favorite places to shop actually every
pretty pretty much the four stores that
I'm showing you guys in this video are
my four go-to places to shop but Shoko
holds a special place in my heart that
was meant to be born I was chilling
because I actually loved the style in
Australia like the clothes there they
speak to my soul for instance its silk
romper it's got a hook at the top so it
halters around your neck
like such and then it singes around the
waist and then it's just shorts on the
bottom and it's the most adorable thing
that exists in my closet so the next
thing I have to show you guys is another
proper again I don't even actually I
might say this one was better than the
last one it's got like this is just
perfect for the end of summer early fall
you know like that transition period
where it's like you want to wear fall
clothes but it's still really hot
outside the colors in this are still
very fall-like but I am obsessed with it
you're gonna notice there's a bit of a
silk theme going on in this video but I
also picked up this silk romper as well
very similar to the style of the glass
dropper I just showed you with the
flared sleeves the flared shorts and
then again with the ribbon that you can
tie up in the back adorable I'm obsessed
with it so the next romper that I picked
up is this one here I'm gonna have to
get like a good nude bra to go
underneath the top is all crochet and it
is see-through so again with the nude
bra love the color of this reminds me of
Cinderella it's so pretty I also love
that baby blue is kind of like a thing
this fall but yeah that's what it looks
like and then the shorts are like
pleated the last but not least I picked
up a pair of high-waisted nude jeans but
yeah they're just like high-waisted and
they're jeggings which is awesome
because they're super comfortable
they're not like the type that you put
on highways didn't you're literally like
dying's or friendly jeans you know they
tell you your butt looks great and they
let you eat all the food and drink you
want because they stretch with you let's
do forever 21 first thing I picked up
from forever 21 is this dress here this
dress was only $22 at ninety cents and
it's probably the best $22.90 that i've
ever spent in my life it's really
stretchy material it goes up high around
your neck and it's sleeveless and then
it's kind of fitted my favorite part
about this though is the bottom of the
dress it's got like the scoop detailing
and I just find that super super
flattering next I picked up this shirt
probably the comfy shirt that I own ever
this one was a little bit more expensive
it was a thirty-three dollars but I'm
not kidding you this is the softest
material I've ever felt in my life and
it's just this massive oversized like
t-shirt thing sweater I don't even know
what this is but it it just needed to be
in my closet
to exist in my life next I picked up
this skirt from forever 21 it was $12
I believe $12.90 I love the material of
this what is this calll that's like
velvet you almost it's this nude skater
skirt and it is in like a velvety
material I hope that's what this
material is because I'm probably going
to be using that word a lot this video
so the next shirt that I picked up was
this one here it was $20.90 it's in the
color mold the material of this is
actually such good quality it's thicker
and it's a bit stretchy so surprisingly
I can wear this without a bra which is
that says a lot really cool thing about
this shirt is the back of it so it's
like all laced up in the back and again
the color is just wicked it's just this
is such a sick color for the fall time
and then last but not least I picked up
a little cropped speckled workout shirt
from forever 21 this was $17 and then I
got the matching leggings they're
cropped leggings though and they have
like mesh on the legs which again and
like it's in like a v-shape so I find
that again it just looks very flattering
for all body types and last not least
I'm going to share with you guys all of
the stuff that I got from Charlotte
Russe this was definitely the biggest
portion of clothes that I bought you
know some people eat their feelings I
was definitely shopping out my feelings
when I did this little bender but I feel
better I do it really mended my soul it
was the perfect therapy that I needed
and now I get to share that therapy with
you guys so the first thing I picked up
were these flats one of them's sorry
they're like these nude suede oh is it
velvet or suede it's more suede it's not
velvet suede
so those skater skirt was also suede I
just wanted to make sure I had like a
good fall stapled shoe that was flat in
my wardrobe and these are just come
figure to walk in dancing so that is the
pair of nude flat foot I got and I love
that it has like the ankle cuff the next
thing I got from Charlotte Russe was
this hat it was like a baby dusty pink
it's fake leather material so this is
the pink hat I got my head guys there's
a fun random tip or fact about me I
think it's also because my hair is so
thick but I don't
big head so hats normally don't fit me
all that well if this one kind of feels
like it's sliding off my head but keep
it we're gonna work with it so the next
time I got was this little peplum shirt
it's got like mesh detailing at the top
which is super cute hooks up in the back
and then again it's just a peplum like
it just flares out so yeah that's a
little peplum shirt that I picked up
from Charlotte Russe the next I picked
up this tan colored dress I feel like
this dress just reminds me of Pocahontas
it's like a t-shirt style dress and
again it scoops at the bottom the only
thing I have to say about this one is
that I wish it was cut like I wish the
hem was a bit shorter so I'm probably
going to take this in just to get it
hand a little bit and then the next
t-shirt dress that I got is this grey
one this one's definitely more fitted
and then it's super cute because in the
back it's got like an open back with a
crisscross this would just be super cute
with like a nice plaid tied around the
waist next I picked up this really
adorable black romper it's the one that
has like the cuff around the neck and
this is what it looks like here I'm
going to do a cutaway because there's no
way I can hold this romper up to make it
look cute but it cuts off off the
shoulder and has the cuff thing around
your neck
super adorable super cute and the
material again on this is really really
good quality I don't wait to wear that
like bro night that I know I'm gonna
meet a hot guy with it being like the
back to fall type season it's always
nice to pick up a new pair of jeans and
I wanted one that had like kind of like
patches and rips and stuff to be honest
with you guys like I never wear jeans I
have I think three pairs of actual jeans
that I also picked up a pair of
high-waisted like black they're kind of
like legging materials are definitely
not workout leggings they are like
actual pants people that say leggings
aren't pants I don't agree with you okay
just let me live my life so I needed a
pair of just like normal black not
workout high-waisted pants and I found
lumps Robert here again it's kind of
similar to the one from show Pope
syndra's at the waist it's black with
like like corally pink flowers and it's
just so cute material is really really
nice and then also the shorts have like
a little pom-pom e not annoying pom-poms
is just like a trim on the bottom so
next I picked up this little set so the
top that I got is this one here it's
like a baby pink
it's got cutouts on the front and it
buttons up at the back of your neck and
it's just yeah it's a pretty standard
crop and then I got leggings these are
high waisted and they match it so it's
like a
said I'm not sure yet if I'm somebody
that can rock a match set but I'm gonna
try maybe I'll have to wear these things
separately but we'll see we'll see
to be determined it also picked up this
pair of skinny jeans they're kind of
blue but they're kind of gray so let's
go with like lay or should we call it
grew let's call it grew and it grew
better I don't have very many jeans and
I thought that this is a really really
cute color even to wear this with the
cropped shirt that I just showed you
guys would be super cute for fall next I
picked up this hat it's a floppy hat
there's not much more to say about it it
barely fits my head from the fact that
you now know I have a massive head I
lost my hats I don't know what happened
to them I lost a bunch of them so I
needed a new black floppy hat and I
thought just little cute this is you see
a person on the street wearing a cool
hat and you instantly want to be their
friend I was feeling some type of way
when I was doing these shopping sprees
because some things are quite similar I
got this silk it's again like a baby
pink nude silk romper it's got like a
low-cut I don't know why but when I see
this all I think of is Ariana Grande
it's from Charlotte Russe and finally I
have three pairs of shoes to show you
guys yeah three I know guys I actually
when I say I have a shopping problem I'm
not kidding so this is the first pair
that these little booties are these not
the cutest things you've ever seen in
your life
black is such a good staple and they
have a little peep toe which I'm
obsessed with I don't know I just feel
like these are those types of shoes that
you put in your closet because you know
you can wear it with pretty much
everything kind of like that suede
material as well again they spoke to my
soul I had to get them they're like nude
/ pink emo dusty pink whatever you want
to call it they're like that suede
material again and then the side has
like this lace up detail with little
tassels they have like a cuff around
your ankle and a little thing around
your toe but their booties they're not
heels so you can actually walk in them
last but not least I picked up a good
staple that I'm actually kind of shocked
that I don't have you I pointed toe
pumps I actually have a specific video
and slash outfit and mine for these
shoes but they're also good to just have
in your closet like you can't go wrong
with this pointed toe stiletto like shoe
that it that is all that is everything I
believe I was also going to show you
guys some candles in this video but I
feel like I've just been talking forever
so I won't bore you any longer so that
was it for my early fall haul let me

obsessed with clothes and shopping and
