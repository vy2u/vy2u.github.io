overdue but I'm basically going to be
doing the Q&amp;amp;A answers that I put on
Twitter so this will be my first Twitter
Q&amp;amp;A so if you guys aren't already
following me on twitter be sure to click
the link down below
I'll leave my Twitter for you guys to go
on and follow me and you guys can ask me
any future questions if yours wasn't
answered in this video or if you didn't
get a chance to see and ask your
questions so this is going to be number
one of my Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so I'm going to
jump right into the tweets and start
answering them my phone is incredibly
slow so bear with me okay so that list
or Elise I'm sorry for said your name
wrong I'm going to put your Twitter
right here so if I butcher your name
guys I apologize
Elise asks or list I'm again sorry who
are your favorite artists I love you
Kailyn so my favorite artist I'm
assuming you mean musician or like
musical artists and I have such a wide
spectrum of tastes when it comes to
music so I would probably have to say
people like Taylor Swift some oh I
really like Drake uhm and then I also
like like imagine dragons I like
Coldplay I like Ray LaMontagne
I like Ron Pope I like Luke Bryan Keith
Urban I like so many different artists
so I could literally go on for hours I
have so many favorites but those are
just a few to name
Dianna's stay Temba or setenta sorry
which is your favorite books or what are
your favorite books so um I have a lot
of favorite books again like The Fault
in Our Stars
I loved the Twilight series I love The
Hunger Games series but the divergent
series but my all time favorite books
right now is a series that I literally
read in a week straight and it was the
selection series so there's the
selection of the elite and then the one
and I read them all in a spin I think of
like six days I was so excessive and
that I was so like depressed or upset
when they were over so if you guys are
looking for a new
our new books to read go check those
books out because they're amazing TIFF
or Tiffany Cho asked why did you decide
to become vegan I've actually became
vegetarian at a really young age I was
like 13 or 14 at the time and I'd wanted
to become vegetarian before that but my
parents were like you need to eat your
nutrients or like I guess just kind of
went by what they knew so they didn't
let me right away but I think I was 13
or 14 when they were finally like okay
like will let you ease into being a
vegetarian and then I always my last
goal was always to become vegan so
ultimately that's basically what made me
decide so
should Dara see blue again or should I
see blue I'm sorry I fed butchered your
name asks when's your birthday so my
birthday is in February its February 28
1994 and I am a Pisces April Montgomery
asks what do you like better shopping or
Starbucks um that is a tough question
but I would probably say shopping
because I love to shop and I do really
love Starbucks but I'm totally okay with
making coffee at home - so I'm gonna say
shopping so Ansel asks or I don't know
if that's your real name or if you just
put that there because in the Fault in
Our Stars but asks how do you like your
to style crop tops by the way I love
your videos
my favorite style crop tops is usually
with something high-waisted like a crop
top with a high-waisted shorts and then
like a cardigan or a kimono over top so
yeah so directioner alert asks favorite
movie of all time
so I feel like my favorite movie of all
time changes all the time but I can tell
you my favorite movie right now of all
time and that is I'm gonna say lately I
have been obsessed with the last song
again so that's probably my favorite
movie of all time right now so joylynn
asks what is one thing or what is
something that you can't live without
and I feel like there's a lot of
material things that I feel I could
probably easily say I couldn't live
without but when it boils down to it
it's probably family and family without
a doubt includes Bentley so I'm counting
him in as family so like my mom's dad's
sister
and dog and Nana and all that kind of
stuff so sandy online asks what's a
makeup product you could not live
without and I would have to say if I
could only have one makeup product it
would probably be mascara so amber asks
your top three favorite quotes so again
I am such an indecisive person and my
favorite things change all the time but
if I have to choose my three favorite
quote quotes right now number one would
be a negative mind will never bring you
a positive life number two would be rule
your mind or it will rule you and number
three some days you have to create your
own sunshine so as you can kind of get
from the moral gist of all three of
those quotes I'm a very strong believer
in keeping a and keeping or maintaining
a positive outlook and attitude because
I think it can change the way you see
life and it can change the way that life
sees you God we're getting real deep
right now there's a car driving by and
it's being really loud so I'm sorry guys
your thought okay I'm gonna try and
smoke over it so charity asks do you
playing it plan on getting married or
having kids anytime soon so um I'm only
20 so I wouldn't say anytime soon but I
absolutely do plan on getting married
when I'm a couple years or like five ten
I don't know I probably want to be
married before I'm 30 so I guess it's in
the next 10 years I plan on getting
married and having a kid or two I don't
think I want more than two kids so I do
plan on getting married having kids but
no more than two and got still far off
into the future so Abby asks you are an
amazing singer how long have you been
playing guitar I started playing a
guitar actually I got my first guitar in
grade five but I never really started
playing it until about probably grade
nine or grade ten my best friend at the
time her name was Mira we decided to
grab her guitars and actually learn how
to play and we like taught ourselves and
we would play all these fun different
covers and saying
and yeah so basically we like inspired
each other to learn how to play the
guitar and so it was pretty much great
10 when I learned how to play the guitar
so I don't know how old are you 10 16 so
like four or five years ago okay I'm
gonna shut my window cuz that is getting
extremely annoying
so Tammy asks if you could go back in
time and give yourself one piece of
advice what would it be I feel like if I
can go back in time specifically to like
when I was 14 or 15 I probably would
have told myself to not question who I
was and believe in myself I guess
because a lot of the times I found that
I made like the biggest mistakes in my
life I would say not really mistakes cuz
I don't really necessarily believe in
regret but I'd say the times where I was
the least myself was when I was always
questioning who I was
or letting other people make me question
who I was so I think if I could go back
in time I would tell myself that not to
let anybody make you second guess who
you are or make you feel like you have
to be any different and to believe in
yourself and follow your own path and do
you and the people that the right people
that are meant to be in your life won't
have any problems with it and will stick
around you no matter what so or elane
asks what kind of dog is Bentley and I
get this question a lot Bentley is a
chihuahua - hound or otherwise known as
chiweenie but with people but people
usually ask I say Chihuahua - OH because
chiweenie sounds funny so angela asks
will you continue making videos as you
get older i really do hope - yeah i'm
actually I'm gonna say yes because I
mean even if only five of you are still
watching my videos like 10 years from
now I'll keep making them just for you
guys because I genuinely like thoroughly
enjoy YouTube that much shakeela Marie
asks your name by the way is very
similar to mine which tattoo is your
faith my absolute favorite tattoo would
probably be the one that I got on the
side of my hand it is really faded right
now and I gotta get a touched up but
it's my favorite because it's in my
papa's handwriting and it's my last
name and it just means the most to me I
think so courtney lynn asks what is your
favorite makeup look and who is your
favorite beauty guru my favorite makeup
look is probably like like simple is
more in a way that like foundation
eyeliner and mascara or just like
foundation bronzer and mascara that's
probably like my favorite makeup look
because i just feel like sometimes when
you put a lot on your face and you're
really trying to like vamp up your
features sometimes it kind of overthrows
your entire look and it makes you look
too done up so I find there's something
really pretty and like simple looks but
that adds such elegance to people's
faces and who's your favorite beauty
guru I have a lot of favorite youtuber
Beauty gears or youtubers whatever Wow
one of my all-time favorites is probably
Carly by Paulo because she just has the
most incredible makeup tutorials Oh
Heidi asks who are your current favorite
tubers so I know I just answered one of
my favorites but I will name off a
couple of her favorites for you guys I
really like Lauren beauty I like bethany
mota I really like niki and gabi Beauty
they're twins they're really cool they
make really fun videos I like mmm I told
you guys I like to cuddle a bivalve and
I really like a lot of youtubers so it's
kind of hard to name off your favorites
because I feel like everybody's just
really cool in their own way so Sami
Taylor asks what is your bet the best
piece of advice you have ever received
and that is probably to follow your
heart and do what makes you happy so
happy bday - I don't think that's your
name but asks if you had to choose your
favorite 1d member who would it be and
why and it'd probably be Harry Styles
because I just find him so like goofily
hot in a weird way like he's so goofy
but he's so hot so it's probably Harry
Styles alright guys so that is my first
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A video so I hope you guys
enjoyed I'm going to
