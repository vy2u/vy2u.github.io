channel for today's video I'm doing a
vlog style where your team with you guys
this has been my most recent like new
year morning routine and it's also I
feel like kind of the routine that I
established for the wintertime solely to
make sure that I'm one still getting up
and getting things done but to also kind
of beating the winter blues and staying
a bit more motivated and like upbeat and
making sure that I have a good day I
just feel like a good morning routine it
can set the whole tone for your day when
the new year began I decided to kind of
you know what's the word Bruce up my
morning routine and then challenge
myself to actually stick to it and I did
it for the whole month of January and it
was probably like 2018 s already been
one of my favorite years and we're only
the second month in just recently this
week I have gotten back into a better
habit of going to bed earlier and waking
up earlier
that's been like a recent struggle of
mine a few things that I did this week
to kind of help push that one of them
was coming up with a bit more of a night
routine which if you guys want that
video to just let me know and I can film
like an updated that routine like
establishing at what point in the night
I need to start doing my routine so that
I'm ready to go to bed by the time that
I should be falling asleep also the
other things are the diffuser that I
have in my bedroom put a little bit of
lavender in that and put it on and it
helps me like relax and fall asleep and
I've been using on my phone there's this
thing called bedtime and so I've been
using this app to to kind of establish
like what time I should be going to bed
and what time I should be waking up I'm
trying to go to bed at 10:30 because I
probably won't fall asleep for at least
15 minutes falling asleep around 10:45
and then waking up at 6:45 which gives
me like 15 minutes to kind of actually
wake up before starting my day at 7
now it's gone and it's real my heart
racing
these are slow it
that I feel I usually
getting used to it
you know there's not
Oh turning
my rap you
turn your places
I said and done it maybe
all along there's a fire on the inside
it's hard to breathe I'm not used to it
I can read all this
my arms refuse that's been my recent
schedule especially for this week and
I've actually finally stuck to it when
I'm walking Bentley I like to kind of
take that time to assess what my mood is
when we wake up and we just like hit the
ground running I feel like we don't
really give ourselves the time to assess
like how we're actually feeling going
into the day just be having like weird
dreams you could have had a weird night
you could have woken up and not really
had the best sleep and without even
fully realizing it you're kind of taking
that mood and going into your date with
it so every time I walk Bentley in the
morning it's like one of the first
things I do I just like take that chance
to kind of gain awareness as to where my
mind sets out where's my mood at what's
my overall feeling and then I come back
in and prove myself a cup of joe and
begin my day something that I've still
been doing checking out my horoscope for
the day which I haven't done yet this is
like a little prequel to my meditation
and then my workout for the day this is
like a good little chunk of the morning
of that my day hasn't fully started yet
but a few things have already been done
like making my bed and walking Bentley
which I know sounds lame but I already
I'm already feeling accomplished so this
is like a little chunk of me time before
my day begins if you're on whatever
latest playlist of me and then I hit up
my horoscope sometimes I'll do a tarot
card reading you know what maybe we'll
do one today just for the sake of the
vlog but this is just like while I drink
my energy juice I just kind of Zen out
and do my own thing on the computer
sometimes I'll work in my planner fun
things like that I'm already loving
today because it's so sunny out that
most mornings I have to plug it in the
string lights around my office because
it's so dark sunlight in the winter is a
blessing other things I like to do
during this chunk of time is sometimes
I'll journal like I said if I'm walking
badly and I'm assessing my mood for the
day and there's something that I feel
like I just need to write out if I feel
like I'm very uh knackered or unfocused
I'll either write in my journal or the
other thing I like to do is I use my
notes on my phone and I'll just kind of
write down my intentions for the day or
just things that I'm noticing or even
just like notes I don't know it helps me
anchor my mind to like a more positive
affirming attitude going into the day
especially if I notice that I'm in like
a bad mood in the morning really quick
I'm gonna go grab my tarot deck and
we'll do a quick tarot reading before
the gym why are you the cutest thing
ever
I'm going to do like a mind body and
spirit reading I started getting into
Tarot just after Christmas after my
sister got me the stack it's just like a
cool way to you know get some messages
from the universe or to make messages
for yourself or just kind of gain a
little bit of insight or inspiration
maybe it'll help trigger a thought that
you wouldn't have thought of or you
wouldn't have seen things that way I had
to not you know pull the reading I don't
know I just like it's like horoscopes
you don't live religiously by them but
they're just cool little ways to gain
some sort of insight or some sort of
inspiration plus it's just fun like
whenever like my sister and I are
hanging out or I'm friends over or
whatever we just do like quick tarot
readings for fun
I'm still like getting to learn my death
so for my mind I pulled the eight of
Wands and that usually means sudden
movement are changed I've pulled this
card a few times of the last like I
would say to eat body I picked the
chariot strong will and triumph I am so
about this card and the mother of cups
is what I pulled for spirit or soul I
get really geeky over this stuff the
mother of cups means insightful and
psychic so I'm gonna stop boring you
guys now I'm gonna finish off the rest
of my coffee put my tarot deck away and
the other thing that I like to do first
thing in the morning is I will leave my
workout clothes on this chair the night
before so that the first thing I have to
do no matter what is change to my work
of gear if I plan on working out the
next day I found to the gym go for a run
do some yoga and yeah we'll catch up
we'll catch up after that
you hover on edge
freezing
I should try to keep track he's so close
I can't find my way back yeah
like it
on the horizon out of reach you want me
to wait back on the beach you wanna stay
together and be free shouldn't try to
keep track so close find my way back
wake up in Seoul
so this new obsession with putting
butter cinnamon and coconut sugar on
brown bread and toasting it and it
reminds me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
cereal which is something that is like
such a weakness of mine I had to stop
buying it because I was eating I was
going to like a box in two days it
sounds really weird but you have to draw
it so usually while I eat breakfast I'll
like go through the notes on my phone
and just start kind of like planning out
my workday
if I have running around to do what my
plan is what my schedule is I'll kind of
maybe set some timers like I want to be
ready within the hour or something like
that
just to kind of get me into like the
more structured mindset of a workday
right now I'm just going through what
the notes on my phone making a plan for
what I have to do today for work really
good to talk with my mouth full
and then sometimes I'll kind of like go
when we Heart It or tumblr anybody is
like one of my favorite parts of the day
is depending on what I'm doing that day
if I want to have like a certain look or
if I'm going for a certain vibe I'll
kind of like look up hair makeup and
outfit ideas before it's getting ready
so I actually don't blow-dry it and cut
my hair every single day but because
today is Friday I'm filming this on a
Friday I try not to wash my hair on the
weekends I try and give it a break
because that's not normally what I'm
doing my workout so I'm gonna go ahead
and curl it now tomorrow I have a brunch
too so I kinda want to have like wispy
like like daytime waves you know so I
feel like if I curl my hair today
it'll be like bedhead ish tomorrow and
then to comb my hair I'm just using a
Bellamy wand this is the one that I
always use it's like I think it's one
and a half or two inch barrel
I don't do layers I just take chunks and
I curl this side away from my face and
this side away from my face and I just
kind of like shake it up
so the last part of my morning routine
is I literally forced myself to have a
dance party except my phone's just like
no not responding to me at all so I have
like there's like a couple songs that
have been my go-to lately but there's
one song that is my particular favorite
and I noticed playlists is feeling
badass and I mean realistically you
could probably hit shuffle and whatever
song came on would be a good pre-work
dance party playlist specifically my
favorite recently has been problems by a
petite biscuit I'm not gonna be able to
play it because of obvious copyright
reasons but if you really want to join
the party I would pause this video open
up the song hit play then come back to
the video and then we'll get this dance
party started I'll put a good tune on
over top of it that said I'll leave a
link to it down below but options yours
that the dance party commits
to anyone that actually put on the song
by petit biscuit you'll load a new
button how can you honestly have a bad
day after following a dance party to
that so that pretty much winds down my
morning your team there's not much more
to it sometimes things shift and change
and obviously depending on whether it's
like a Friday where I actually blow-dry
and curl my hair or other days when I
know that I don't have that much to do
where I'm not filming that day I like to
put French braids my hair and leave hair
masks in and then the next day when I
work out I wash out the hair mask after
like like I work out in the French
braids and I sleep on the French braids
and then other times I'll do guided
meditations sometimes when I walk
Bentley and sometimes before I go do my
workout if I feel like I'm really
dreading working out that day I try and
meditate first so that I can like set my
intention and then go also before
anyone's too concerned I did feed
Bentley I just realized afterwards that
I forgot to vlog it but lately I've been
making this little combo of food for him
if you got something to do like DIY like
dog stuff or dog food or recipes or
things like that definitely let me know
but I've been playing around with
cooking and making Bentley's dog food
and dog treats at home and I'm having so
much fun with it he's obsessed with his
food right now it's just such a good way
to bond you know aside from that thank
you guys so much for hanging out with me
this morning and rolling through my
morning routine all of just this tiny
little changes like I've been forcing
myself to work out in the morning and
not pushing it off till night I used to
think I was someone that liked working
out better at night at my workout done
in the morning I already feel so
accomplished before my days even begun
and no matter how I'm feeling that
morning if I wake up in a bad mood or
whatever it is if I work out and I do
some yoga and some meditation before my
day starts I can feel like a completely
different person going into work which
will make such a difference when I
actually try it and sit down and be
productive and focus on something
anchoring my spirit or my my like
intention of the day it just it makes it
so that like the whole week can be
kick-ass and then by the weekend okay
tomorrow when I don't use my planner and
I don't follow through my morning
routine it's like a little break from it
before coming back into it for the work
week throwing in the dance party and
just doing tiny little changes and
things has made such a diva just that
big fluffy robe like adding that in to
my morning routine every time I get into
the shower it's just such a thing now
it's like a ritual you know like you're
creating a ritual to like go in
the day in a certain mindset all the
time and that's that's that was that's
the combination to my ritual so I hope
you guys enjoyed today's video if you
guys want me to do an updated nighttime
routine just thumbs up or leave a
comment down below also if there's
anything that you guys do in your
morning routine that you think makes a
big difference on boosting your mood and
making sure you have a good day leave
that down below too
aside from that thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you guys are having
an amazing Sunday and you're ready to
wake up and you know kick ass tomorrow
