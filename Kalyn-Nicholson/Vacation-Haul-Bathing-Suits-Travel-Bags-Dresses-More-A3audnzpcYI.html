doing a vacation haul with Christine
because if you guys don't already know
I'm gonna be going on vacation in about
three days so we actually went in
together on getting a few things online
for our trip so we've decided to team
together and do a little haul video and
I asked you seem to be in it so that you
guys can see some of the stuff she got
to so other than that I think we should
just probably jump right in because we
have quite a few items to show you
we'll start with Victoria's Secret so
some of the stuff that I got from this
very secret you guys will have already
seen if you watched my what I got for
Christmas but I'm just going to
basically show it all to you get all
four bathing suits
I'm usually someone who goes first
strapless or something that can become
strapless cuz I'm really big on not
getting tan lines you've got these kind
of babies to talk to what they are is
they're clients that you can wear as a
halter or it'll like kind of go back
into a strappy thing well so you can
wear it either way and I really liked it
and I thought oh this is on sale was it
yeah this was only $15 so I have shown
this bathing suit before but this is one
of my favorite ones that I caught from
the Victoria's Secret website and I
don't think this one was part of the
semi-annual
time to go on vacation so this Sun it
has like a nice tropical floral print on
like the main material of it and then it
is lined with like this cheetah print
and then the straps themselves it has
this like cool 3 strap detailing that
turns it took thicker strap to tie
around your neck of course I also picked
up the bottoms for it as well so these
are just the bottoms and they just the
exact same pattern they have cheetah on
the straps and then the floral in the
middle it's a the same concept where
it's the halter that can go back into
the strapless and I got it in the white
paisley just because I thought it was a
really different pattern and I thought
it was cool and it was also $15 again
don't know what achieve you put this
this one's not as padded though but yeah
so it just looks like that
so my next one again made the same you
see I could getting another push-up bra
one but I actually like the fit of this
one better and I'm not exactly sure why
I think it's a bit different but this
one is in the tiger pattern if you guys
can't tell I have a little bit of
obsession with animal print so the next
top I got again in the strapless just
huge on the strapless I'm my favorite
colors purple and I kind of wanted one
of these tops for a really long time
this one wasn't on sale I believe it was
only like yeah it was good offensive so
yeah it's just this lilac and it comes
with a strap too if you want to but I
probably still wear it strapless yes I
picked up this top here and it is in the
just the halter style and just being
that I am a little bit more bigger bust
and I wanted something that was going to
be without padding that I can wear so
this one I took the padding out of it is
also nice because it doesn't add a lot
of size so this one's going to be really
really nice as well and I love the
pattern so yeah I basically ended up
getting almost the same size that this
moves Rocco Rossi yeah I thought that
was really cool this is the only like
non struck
but I really like it and it's actually
really flattering to and then we both
ended up really liking the one style of
bathing suit bottoms that Victoria
Secret has we actually got the same ones
in both white and black
so these ins I think these ones were on
sale and if they weren't they were cheap
they were like $27.99 or something like
that's something pretty cheap so we both
got them in black ended up getting them
and in white as well and so shopping
online it was if you spent $75 or over
you brought this beach bag with a bikini
bag on the inside so this itself it is
the BB bag which is kind of in Italian
goals we've got like neon tassels on the
front which is pretty and we figured
this would work really well tightly put
our towels and stuff in and like extra
clothes yeah stuff like that it's nice
because Stan won't stay inside of it
because it has with a hole
I just think my own can fit into it so I
figured I would end up using it as a
like a travel make up like so I actually
just have one more bathing ship to show
you guys and if you guys remember or
have been watching my agent for a long
time and I have a bit of an addiction to
buying bathing suits and I don't know
why because I live in Canada of all
places but I ended up getting a triangle
bathing suit I caved and got one because
I wanted one for a little while now it
actually came with this bikini bag so
I'm putting all my bikinis in this for
traveling so it's obviously you're just
like the standard triangle bathing suit
bottoms but the top I ended up going
with was just the standard triangle top
so I want to be like a nice good just
like standard bathing suit and I love
the color of this especially with like a
nice tan from bikini village I decided
to get a few into cover-ups just because
I most of the time when I do vacation on
the beach I always end up wearing a
bikini cover-up for this cover-up and
it's the kind where you can go on bikini
village website and they show you a
million different ways that you can try
it so I got it in red but I also got in
black but I'm
pretty sure I've already packed the
clock went away so I don't have it with
me it's a really nice material and it's
really stretchy so it's cool when you
want to like tie it into a really cool
pattern it's like really nice over top
of your bathing suit yeah so it's just
like that I can easily throw it on and
the back is open back which I thought
was really nice too
you can never go wrong with open back
and I thought the pattern is really nice
too just for going away be nice to make
your lilac bathing suit on that one has
been kings so I really like that so that
was mainly what I got for a cover-up I
actually picked up this shirt here it's
just a light crochet detail top from
Victoria's Secret and this will just be
nice just for throwing over again like
christine said just for throwing over
the bathing suit if you don't feel like
wearing like a fall out outfit another
quick thing that I picked up while on
the Victoria's Secret website as well is
I've been updating a lot of my travel
stuff since I'm going to be traveling a
lot more this year so I picked up just
the little travel set from the trade
secret this one is the luggage tag and
it's the standard pink and white stripes
and then I also got the passport cover
as well and yeah so and then just the
last thing I picked up just for
traveling was just this duffel bag and I
ended up getting this to use as my
carry-on so this is just like a standard
duffle bag and it has the strap you can
throw over your shoulder as well the
inside doesn't have very many prophets
but it's nice and big and I'll be able
to fit everything in it for traveling on
the plane so that is the bag that I got
ok so we also decided to give ball caps
which is kind of like a running joke
we've had for a while but fall caps are
nice even just for like this summer
that's coming up like if you're camping
and stuff out of there just keeping it
off get your hair out of your face and
stuff keeping the Sun out of your eyes
so I said of going with the dark navy I
believe it was and this is just the New
York Yankees ball cap so that's the hat
that I got and we also made sure we got
the snapback so that we could put
ponytails so this is
I got and I decided I really wanted to
get the Boston house red neon it but
they didn't have that and snap out and I
really wanted that so I ended up getting
this LA maybe hat as well but then it
got more relaxed yeah they're actually
decently cheap I that also picked up
actually one more hat - this is just so
more so for like a Sun Hat or when I
have my bikini on or traveling and stuff
so I actually picked this up from
Claire's so this is the Hat I got I know
I have a lot of hats like this but this
one I find it is more so like summery
than the fall ones that I have
so guys wear this hat okay and now last
but definitely not least we picked up a
few things from show PO and they're just
cute little dresses that we have for if
we're gonna go to like a night out for
dinner while we're away and it's my
favorite one cuz again it was my
favorite colors purple ended up getting
this dress right here and it's just a
nice sweetheart neckline
and I really liked it I thought was
really cool and it poops out kind of at
the bottom which I thought would be cute
and this was lots of bright color so I
figured with a tan I would yeah my
matching dress because apparently we're
like five-year-old sisters that need to
have like the same things but like a
different color the dress I ended up
getting is this one here and as you guys
know my favorite colors pinks and so
they actually fit together but this one
is more of like a tighter dress and it's
got like a little tiny slit at the
bottom and again it has that sweetheart
neckline and I just I loved the colors
of this one and I like the fit of it so
I ended up getting this dress right here
okay well thank you so basically it's
like the halter and it comes down
completely in the front but it isn't too
revealing like y'all otherwise you may
yeah and so it just comes out like that
and then it's completely bad I'll say
yeah the second thing I got was I ended
up being like a two-piece outfit and
um I actually was very iffy about this
one but it turned out being I think my
favorite thing that I got in general for
this entire trip so this is what it
looks like here this is the print it's
late dress this is a dress it's really
short but it looks good I swear teal I
don't even know like a teal and like
purple and blue kind of hue and I know
it seems really cropped but the bottoms
that go with it
are very high waisted so it actually
only leaves about like two inches of
skin between the top and the bottom
alright guys so that concludes the
