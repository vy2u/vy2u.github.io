I'm starting off with my Annabelle CC
primer and just rubbing this all over my
face and since I have a bit of a tan I'm
mixing my steal of one step bronzer with
my everyday foundation and I will leave
all the products that I'm using listed
below and I'm basically just mixing
those together with my Sigma kabuki and
just blending this all into my skin and
then using my covergirl and Olay CCI
rehab concealer and fair and I'm using
this to highlight and as well as cover
up my dark circles and then I'm just
blending that in with a small stippling
brush and after blending it all into
place I'm going over with an Annabelle
translucent powder just that way I don't
ruin any of the highlighting and
foundation that I've just done so I'm
just going over that with a big giant
powder brush
and then again I'm sure you guys are not
surprised I'm going in with my brow bar
to go by gerard cosmetics and then just
filling in my brows and creating a
little bit more shape and definition to
them
I'm going to be going in with my Urban
Decay potion primer since I'm doing a
little bit more of a dramatic look and
I'm just rubbing this in with my fingers
all over my eyelid eyelid in my inner
tear-duct as well
I'm going to be using my new tooth
palette for about 90% of the colors I'm
going to be using and I'm going in with
sultry on a pencil eye shadow brush and
I'm just blending this into my crease
and then going over obviously with a
blending brush to make sure it's a bit
more seamless I'm then going in with
standoffish and using this as my lid
color and just patting that all on top
and then just blending one more time
with the sultry for the pink color I'm
going into my Coastal Scents shimmer
palette and I know this looks really
really dramatic but it'll all work out
in the end trust me and I'm using that
pencil brush again to just blend this
right into my crease and then going over
it again with my tapered blending brush
and then back on the new tube palette
I'm going in with the color sexy which
is a deep maroon color I'm putting this
into my crease again and concentrating
it nice and deep into the crease and
then just blending it out a little bit
more
and then to add a little bit of
definition to the outer corner I'm going
in with Sirius and I'm just putting this
on the pencil brush and creating a V on
the outer corner of my eye and then I'm
going to take my blending brush and
blend everything all nicely together
until it's not so dramatic and yeah
I'm then using whatever is left on the
pencil brush to just add a little bit of
color on my lower lash line I'm going in
with mary lou manizer to create the last
little highlight on my inner tear duct
and as well as under my brow bone and
then I'm going in with just a liquid
liner and lining a winged line all on
the top lashline to add a little bit of
brightness and open up my eyes I'm just
putting a bit of white eyeliner on my
lower lash line and then going in and
curling my lashes and for mascara I'm
using my miss manga by L'Oreal big
surprise and I'm just adding a coat or
two of this onto both my upper and lower
lashes
I'm then using my NYX matte bronzer to
shape and contour my face
and then I'm going in with wet and wilds
very shimmer to add to the maroon color
that we used in the eyes I just thought
it would add a nice ruin on the cheeks
as well now obviously this part is
optional but I'm going in with my Ardell
glamour lashes and just putting those on
but you guys could just keep with
mascara if you don't want to put on the
fake lashes and then for lips I'm going
in with my Annabelle lip liner in buff
and then going over it with Mac Spears N
and since this is a Valentine's Day date
night look I'm setting everything in
place with my Mac setting spray and
moving on to hair I'm just going to be
using a comb to create a side part and
just brush out the top and then I'm also
going to be using that comb to tease a
little bit at the back crown of my head
I'm then grabbing a large chunk towards
the front of my bangs on the thicker end
of my hair and just setting that off to
the side while I collect the rest of the
hair and create a side pony that's quite
low and then we're going to take that
big giant chunk and braid it you can
either French braid it or Dutch braid it
whichever you like better I like to
Dutch braid it and then once it's
braided all the way down I'm just going
to tug on pieces to create more volume
in the braid
so tugging on the edges of each side of
the braid will create it to make it look
a lot bigger than it actually is which
is really helpful especially if you have
thin hair and then adding it into the
ponytail and then just taking random
chunks of my hair rolling it up and
Bobby pinning it into place this is a
nice way to do like a little bit of a
bun updo without it looking too formal
so as for my outfit my shoes dressed and
my little bracelet are all from Lulu's
and I'll leave all the links down below
and I actually added a little bow to the
back just to keep the straps up higher
so my entire outfit will be lifted down
below all the details and that is pretty
much it for this hair makeup and outfit
look for Valentine's Day if you guys
want a more casual look for Valentine's
Day be sure to thumbs up and other than
that I'll see you guys all in a future
