answer if I was the music would you be
the dancer if I was the student would
you be the teacher if I was sitting up
would you be the creature would you be
my I still got an attitude like I
legitimate under I still got a lot of
 and learn how to mid and then I can
do it in just another school hi guys
happy Friday it is the weekend and I've
never been more excited in my life
unless my eyebrows look a little more
aggressive than usual today
so it's actually technically 3:00 p.m.
so I'm starting the vlog a little late
in the game but today has been a little
crazy I had to edit a bunch of video
this morning was just SuperDuper boring
and I took down my for it which is super
depressing but I have a bunch of people
coming up this weekend like my siblings
should be here any second packed up BAM
and then tomorrow
Maggie's coming up you guys remember
Maggie I used to live with her but in
case you forgot I'll put a montage up
here to remind you guys who mags is my
dad and his girlfriend are also coming
out tomorrow we're all going to go out
for dinner and then Monday
Meek's coming up and my sister is going
to be here through all of this so it's
gonna be a pretty hectic weekend but I'm
feeling like extremely spoiled because I
get to see so many like important people
so it's a good it's a good busy so
everyone visiting is kind of like a
birthday present within itself the
verdict was to take a team now because
we're lame she got over there blow dry
like this lettuce I always think I want
you but I don't how you lured and you
doing my family's weird
I've been watching for Sun care solution
local drink those sky was a little
orange it was like super orange didn't
even show up that orange on camera but
it was like ridiculously orange the
question of the night so I know a house
with my siblings or should I go like
half white I'm just gonna chill out
so it is not Saturday I'm making this
blog a two day blogs just because I feel
like it is vlog and Duffy yesterday so
now that it's Saturday Maggie is
officially here now imagine how that no
bad might not Bob do this delicious one
is actually really good so kind of put
on like mascara go for dinner I really
don't feel like a man can wear this I've
learned yet I feel you should bring the
blanket and my dad and his girlfriend
just got here so we already know this
job and I don't remember you forgot to
film and outro to the video we're like
my before head oh I'm going to do a
quick tumblr Q&amp;amp;A with you guys it's just
because it's becoming quite a little
routine that we've started hasn't it
okay so an anonymous question says hello
love your videos love the vibe to give
me but I want to know how to make boys
like me I'm a teen and I've never had a
boyfriend never had a date never even
kissed a guy is there any way I can
increase the chances of me getting a
boyfriend so first things first I
wouldn't make your objective be getting
a boyfriend because I mean first of all
your value is way more than whether or
not you have or can get a boyfriend
trust me you can totally get a boyfriend
you were already likable just the way
you are the personality that you have
the hobbies that you love to do any guy
would want to get to know you it's just
a matter of opening that door so that
you seem approachable to guys open just
to go for it just literally Oh
in that door you're looking for a love
interest if you're letting looking to
let boys or like a relationship into
your life be confident be a strong
independent woman and go for it and even
if it doesn't work out it'll show other
guys that you're someone that is
interested anonymous wants to know what
type of Nike shoes you have and I have
Nike Free Runs just like the standards
they're super dirty some bones says I
love seeing the books you're reading
fiction and nonfiction would you ever
consider doing a book club or organized
read along so I wouldn't say that I've
thought about doing like a book club or
an organized read along but if that's
something you guys are interested in let
me know down below because I could
totally but we could make that happen
but one thing I did I do have an idea of
or really want to do is every time I
finish a book like write a little
message in it and send it out to one of
you guys and every time I finish a book
I can send it out to a new person and
then whoever gets it could write a
message in it and pass it along or keep
it or anything like that I like The
Sisterhood of the travelling book so
I've got something also that you guys
are interested in this is an idea that
I've had for a little bit now and I've
actually given three books away already
so if you guys want me to start doing
that then thumbs up or let me know down
below because we can start that like
ASAP rocky and the last question is from
an anonymous person and it says when
moving to a new city like you did how
did you meet new people and making
friends did you already have friends in
Toronto couple people that have met have
been through YouTube with your work
there are some friends that I already
had in Toronto some people that are
already new and also just going out and
doing things like getting to know
friends of friends I also joined like a
soccer team and hot yoga just pushing
myself to go do things where there's
going to be all different types of
people pushing myself to go to like
events that are related to YouTube and
things like that and I mean it's not
easy I feel like especially in this
generation and also at this age it's
really hard to make a whole new set or
like group I kind of am up for the
challenge I like the challenge and I
also I'm just I'm really enjoying
getting to know new people and all
different kinds of people it's really
cool to see how you are when you meet
new people because I find every single
person kind of pulls out a different
side of you I feel like it's always
important no matter whether or not
you're moving to a new city or you feel
like you have the best solid group of
friends ever I don't think you should
ever stop trying to meet new people and
make new friends
those are the things that
I did too making friends and honestly
it's been a challenge but it's been a
good one
now that this outro is filmed I will see
you guys all in tomorrow's video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
