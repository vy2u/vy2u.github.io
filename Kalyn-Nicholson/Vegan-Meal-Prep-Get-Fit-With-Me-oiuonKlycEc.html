voice described soul Arthur I'm so tired
it's gonna go ahead and like you know
take a seat first of all it feels so
good to be walking again I haven't been
vlogging up velocity days well that's
why I've lost like a couple montage
clips that I haven't blogged since my
birthday it feels so good to be vlogging
again that like I'm just the best
whatever the last few days I've actually
been in Miami if you guys were following
me on snapchat you might already know
that Miami palm trees in the breeze
you know the sweetest but I went on a
birthday trip to Miami Florida it was
only for like four days so much fun and
I actually got home last night I like 1
o'clock in the morning I'm so tired I'm
definitely feeling a little free
surprised I'm a little tired of 8:00
8:30 in the morning and so I have a lot
of things to do today actually it's
basically going to be a massive Geist
day first things first I need coffee I
went to go make a coffee this morning
literally have no coffee that is
honestly like a death sentence to
someone like me
I'm putting pants on I'm gonna run
downstairs grab a copy copy not is how
tired I am grab a coffee then and then
I'm going to get my together
come on I may have gone a little
overboard with the coffee
so I'm suddenly not feeling so hot like
at all sweaty and over hot but not
feeling so good that said I just went
picked up this parcel this is actually
my birthday gift from my dad and my
brother and my sister they got me an
espresso machine and I've been wanting
an espresso machine for so long
oh my god best thing ever so it is now
at 6:00 p.m. like literally right on the
freaking dot I'm actually feeling so
much better now I have a few things left
to do on my to-do list for the day and
Bentley nice still hasn't reunited yet
which is kind of bad but he's going to
be here soon
so that is super exciting in the
meantime I think I'm going to meal prep
Berg I think I saw I went out and
grabbed groceries today and I'm going to
leave my actual meal prep down below
like some meals that I made and I just
kind of made this one up I didn't really
go off of Pinterest so I'll write down
just like a very easy simple to follow
like recipes for everything down below I
really want to get back onto my meal
prep and like my workout routine I feel
like I really dropped the ball in terms
of like my health as soon as I have
coachella in like a month so I want to
get like my Coachella bond I've still
been generally working out pretty
consistently but my feel prep game has
been so week guys my over each game now
had been on an open high let me tell you
so with that bad I'm going to start
getting back onto a really good like
routine in terms of like my health and
my fitness and the best part is is
because I'm vlogging all month I'm going
to document it all with you guys shall
we meal prep or shall we meal prep I
know science
I wanna go play occasional moments
later
that many you guys won't you dance with
me time that they know that you can go
on you dance with me
good morning guys I'm 30 in the morning
and I'm about to head to my yoga class
we really have has been in so long like
it's been a few week I really come back
from vacation I feel like I'm so like
reset and just like re inspired to do
all of the things again I don't know I
feel so good after doing hot yoga it's
so good not only figure like your body
but just your mind too I have soccer
tonight so I don't want to do like a
hardcore workout so about the grandma
yoga mat and head says that still like
kind of justing from yesterday grab my
water bottle grab my yoga mat and I'm
going to hit some high
oh my all the days spent on critical
morning guys now Friday morning it's
been 10 21 so I still have a few things
on my to-do list today a calendar on my
laptop and answering some emails there
still a few things on my to-do lists
that are from when I got back from my
trip but I just still haven't done yet
yeah workout in my body is so sore today
from hot yoga and then I also had soccer
last night at like 7 p.m. so yeah like
I'm trying to get really hardcore again
with working out meal prepping using my
planner getting dreamcatcher done
there's a deadline now for dreamcatcher
there's just a bunch a little like tasks
and rules and things that I've been
changing around here just feeling like
super uninspired I'm motivated to get
done the things that you know you have
to even if you're planning them like
working out and eating healthy and you
know it's going to make you feel better
for whatever reason you still can't seem
to get on like the bandwagon I highly
recommend changing up your routine doing
things a bit differently whether it be
cooking different meals for meal prep or
doing a different kind of workout like
going back to hot yoga Pilates boxing
changing up little things like that is
huge getting so much more done this week
then I got done in the weeks leading up
to going to Florida so it's just been
very refreshing
it doesn't suffer I mean well I wish it
did
I'll better go pick up my friend cat as
something I actually haven't mentioned
in this vlog yet is that I think I'm
going to like redecorate pretty much my
entire apartment in starting with the
living room few things that I've ordered
online that should be coming in in the
next week or so I debate right now is
between what everything comes in just
kind of going ahead and decorating it
all like right away because I've already
moved some stuff around or waiting and
doing it all at once so that I can film
it with you guys and show you guys kind
of like the process of redecorating and
then doing like a before and after
because if that's a video you guys would
want to see then I would totally just
wait and decorate it on your watch you
know have been punished so god I get the
cabbage crackle pop song pop up on it
and around in Java throw up and drop a
comment I'll get these out here my a
mission wipe open no daredevil Dennis so
not only to be dumbing down so we're
also getting Taco Bell now Friday we
deserve this neither of us would ever

experience I got a I got a vegan
