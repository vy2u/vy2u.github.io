every part was true hey guys and welcome
back to my channel for today's video I'm
doing day 10 of youtuber and if you're
wondering why we're in my kitchen we're
gonna be baking today I'm sure you guys
know if you've watched my past eat over
is that I love doing a fall baking video
solely for the fact that I get to eat it
all afterwards and I'm not kidding you
guys I literally ate all the doughnuts
so I figured I would make a few fun
vegan recipes for the fall time that you
guys can make at home if you decide to
definitely be sure to tweet and forget
about me I will pop up my Twitter my
Instagram up on the screen here's to
definitely be sure to tag me if you guys
decided to try any of the recipes and
aside to that we have a lot of baking to
do so let's get to it
you don't wanna upset a child
so first things first I decided to make
pumpkin spice doughnuts because one who
doesn't like doughnuts into pumpkin
spice doughnuts is just like every basic
girl's dream so I'm going to put text
overlays of all the ingredients but you
guys are gonna see here I just combined
everything from the Pinterest recipe the
only thing that I changed is instead of
pumpkin puree like you see there I
actually use pumpkin pie filling
I just find it adds a little bit more
sweetness to the recipes but you guys
can just go ahead and do the pumpkin pie
puree if that's all you have I'll leave
all of the links to all of the recipes
down below as well but the donuts were
probably on my all-time favorite because
they were amazing with like a morning
coffee so I highly recommend and I'm
also gonna leave a link down below to
the doughnut tray that I bought I got it
off of Amazon and it ships like
overnight so if you guys are looking to
make donuts these could be a thing in
the near future
ie in a day or two thank God to Amazon
Prime
and so while they bake there's so many
different options you can do for a
topping it to the donuts but I decided
to do there was like a maple glaze so I
thought that sounded super good but you
could also just do like frosting or
leave them you know naked however you
like your doughnuts no one's here to
judge
oh so if you guys don't end up picking
up an actual donut tray you can always
make these as muffins to it but these
were by far my favorite in this whole
video second I decided to make some
pumpkin spice the chocolate chip cookies
which I mean it doesn't get much better
than donuts but this is like a pretty
close second so again I'll put all of
the text overlay of the recipe but this
was also super good I mean I went a
little chocolate overload I'm not gonna
lie maybe next time I put less vegan
chocolate chips but I mean there's also
no such thing as too much chocolate
so after rolling all the cookies into
little balls on the tray I actually just
sprinkled them with a little bit of
brown sugar and then halfway through
baking them I press them down just so
that they were a bit more flat because
the dough is a little bit thicker and
this is how they turned out again they
were amazing another really good choice
to have with your morning coffee or you
know just in general because they were
pretty Baltimore
now this is something you can make
whether you're vegan or not but if you
are you probably know the struggle of
the fact that it's really hard to find
like vegan pumpkin spice lattes anywhere
so this is a really easy creamer that
you can make at home and add to your
morning coffees every day and it
literally creates a pumpkin spice latte
at home super easy to make super
delicious and also it's just gonna save
people waxen of money because you won't
be going to Starbucks all the time you
know
and then once it was done I just added
it to a mason jar and kept it in my
fridge and then literally just add it a
bit to my morning coffees to create like
a pumpkin spice flavoring it's quite
insane and then not only that I actually
found some online vegan pumpkin spice
marshmallows I am there's just no words
so I've been adding those to my coffee
too which is probably not the healthiest
but it is quite delicious I'm not gonna
lie and I obviously couldn't do you know
a full baking video without making a
pumpkin loaf because I freaking love
pumpkin love it's like my favorite thing
to eat in the fall time so I decided
this year to make a pumpkin spiced
chocolate marbled pumpkin loaf which is
just a whole new level of insane so this
is how I made it you have to make the
pumpkin spice batter and the chocolate
batter separately and then you literally
just Marble them by taking a chunk by
chunk into a loaf pan and baking it up
another one of my favorite things to
have with a morning coffee I brought
this home with me for Thanksgiving
weekend and it looks like it's safe to
say it's completely gone
so that is it for my fall vegan baking
video I hope you guys enjoyed if you
decide to recreate any of these be sure
to tag me in them and I'm gonna go take
the leftover loaf to Gregg's so that we
can watch Halloween movies and feast I
hope you guys enjoyed today's you Tober
video and I'll see you guys all tomorrow
bye guys post a bit got no job but I got
these songs to sing and that can't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
