to do a what I eat in a day because it
has been so highly requested and I can
do more of these if you guys end up
liking them just thumbs up do keep in
mind though I tried to stabilize this as
much as possible but the next one I film
I'll try and make it a lot less shaky so
I'm just going to apologize now because
it is a little bit cheeky throughout the
entire video so one of the first things
I like to do when I wake up in the
morning is chug back some lemon water so
that's usually the first thing I'll grab
and then while I'm drinking that I will
make my coffee and I usually just use
one of these little like reusable K Cups
and because they're better for the
environment and yeah so make myself just
like a Folgers coffee with a little bit
of vegan coffee creamer and I do use
sweetener I'm not going to lie but I've
narrowed it down to just one sweetener
coffee so it's my little treat you know
so that's usually what I'll start off
for in the morning because I can't
normally eat right when I get out of bed
so after my coffees done I'll usually
make myself some breakfast and for this
day I decided to make myself a smoothie
so I just put two bananas in and then
some frozen strawberries that I had in
the freezer but it ended up being a not
very thick so I added a few more of the
mixed berries and another banana and
then I just blend this up with a little
bit of water
and then so every couple days I try and
do some meal prep so I had this meal
prep teriyaki rice with tofu and
vegetables in my fridge so that's what I
had for lunch and I just sprinkled a
little bit of cilantro on top and warmed
it up in the microwave and yeah super
easy and I normally like to have some
leftovers waiting in my fridge for lunch
because I don't really like to cook in
the middle of the day and also
throughout the day I try and drink at
least three of these water bottles and
that's not including the water I drink
when I normally exercise and for this
day it was an off day for the gym so for
like the form of exercise I did we just
ended up going me my friend went for a
3.5 kilometer walk because it was an off
day so yeah and then for dinner
I made a vegetable fajitas with Meg's so
I warmed up some mushrooms peppers
onions beans and broccoli and a little
bit of carrots in a frying pan and then
as that was warming up I just warmed up
some fajitas and then I added a little
bit of fajita mix it's like got some
spices and stuff in it and yeah that was
pretty much it and then I just threw it
on the fajitas with a little bit of
salsa and some guacamole and cilantro
and I ended up eating about five of
these so yeah that was my dinner
and then I normally like to drink a cup
of tea before bed and I'm still addicted
to peppermint tea so that was how I
ended the night with a big old cup of
peppermint tea which is also super
settling for your stomach so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed it this what I eat in a
day plus daily exercise if you guys want
to see more of these just let me know
down below and I can totally film them
and put them up on Fitness Friday and
other than that I will see you guys all
in a future video bye guys love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
