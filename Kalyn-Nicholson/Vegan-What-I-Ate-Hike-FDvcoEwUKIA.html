vegan what I ate in a day this got such
good positive feedback from my last one
so I figured I would film another one
with you and the awesome thing about
this one is actually a collab with a
really good friend of mine Marissa Leigh
so be sure to go check out her channel
she is the freakin bomb she's all bit
like self love and she's doing a vegan
challenge which is so awesome so be sure
to go check out her would I eat in a day
as well and of course what is morning
time without coffee I'm sure you are all
not surprised that this is how I started
my morning so
yes
right
Oh
so I had a pretty late night before I
had filmed this so I ended up having two
coffees this morning and I did drink
some water too but I didn't film that
and then for breakfast about an hour
later I made myself two packs of
porridge because my bananas were not
ripe and the challenge and the struggle
was so real so I had to have oatmeal
instead and I just made two packs of the
maple brown sugar oatmeal and put a
little bit of almond milk in it
especially this is a good work like meal
to have before you're going to be doing
any sort of exercising which speaking of
I ended up going for a 5 kilometer hike
with my friend at this place it's pretty
close to where we live so we got to hike
to the top of this leg I wouldn't even
call it a mountain but I guess you could
say mountain and I don't know it's just
like a really really pretty trail and
it's actually quite a vigorous hike and
then once you get to the top the view is
absolutely insane so that is what I did
for exercise that day
and then after my hike I made myself
some leftovers from the night before I
just had this leftover like vegan
chicken teriyaki stir-fry that I made
the chicken strips are from I don't
remember the brand but they're just like
vegan chicken strips and then I tossed
it up with some vegetables and stuff so
that was what I ended up having for
lunch and then as a snack I literally
ate this entire bag of snappy crisps
which I'm not proud of but yeah I ended
up dipping some of them in hummus but
these crisp things there are absolutely
just freakin amazing they're so good so
yeah so that was my snack for the day
and there was a snack in my last video
my last what I eat in a day by the way
guys but I forgot to film it and so many
of you were concerned um and then for
dinner I ended up getting a bag of red
potatoes and I steamed them so that I
could make garlic mashed so I added a
little bit of almond milk some salt and
pepper and some garlic powder and mashed
it up and ate this with a whole whack of
green beans and I steamed the green
beans as well and just put a little bit
of salt and pepper on them and I ended
up having about two portions of this for
dinner so yeah that was what I ate
and then my water bottle count for the
day was four so I hope you guys enjoyed
this what I eat in a day and exercise be
sure to check out Marissa's video and I
will see you guys all in my next one
love ya
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
