Hey
hey guys the 1/7 welcome back to my
channel for today's video I promise you
guys on Twitter that I would do a haul
of the things I picked up while I was
traveling because Alan and I got to
shopping quite a bit isn't it like an
extensive hauling massive or anything
but I did get quite a few little things
so I thought it would be fun to share
them with you guys show you where I got
them / the story behind them and also a
lot of these things are from places like
Topshop and H&amp;amp;M so even though I was
like in Europe when I purchased them you
could probably still find them online or
if I can find links to them I'll leave
them down below so those are their new
let's jump in because I am excited to
show you guys absolutely things I go
Tector shall we start with probably the
most monumental thing I purchased while
overseas is good old trusty and you will
know exactly what it is if you're
following me on Instagram hat this hat
became quite a little single in my
wardrobe while in Europe I actually get
this up in Paris I forget the name visit
Lafayette I think laughs I it but I was
like a little mall shopping area we went
to and we walked around it was one
section that was all thrift stuff like
all used and stuff I thought they had
tagged the limits of youth thrift
whatever this hat was there and I was
like oh my god I need you in my life
it's just I needed you know you know let
me just it was one of those things that
like it fits perfectly to my head and I
have a big head okay and it was like
every single outfit that I wore and I
just like it's one of those things that
I didn't know there was something
missing in my life until I found it
you're going to see me in this hat a lot
and now that I've officially shown it to
you guys for this haul I'm just going to
go ahead and leave it on for the rest of
this video and then next if you guys
have been following me for a while
you'll also know when my favorite mugs
that I have I picked up in New York it's
like that Starbucks mug that I use all
the time and it's like all the buildings
and stuff like that so guys they had a
Paris one I think this is going to
become a thing where if they have this
style in any city that I travel to I'm
just going to go right ahead and pick it
and this one's so cute it's cuz it's a
little echo power and the little
Starbucks symbol members bedroom side
it's so cute like it walked right into
my knife stuff I don't haven't showed
you guys any clothes yet but I figured
since we're already talking about
parents I'll just show you the last
thing that I think that while I was
there so Elena and I we kind of had this
idea that while we are in Paris you're
like you know what I kind of want to
splurge on like a nice bag I've never
done that before I've never like put
that money into something that's just
like you know a little gift to yourself
and so they actually had a civil
McCartney at the Lafayette mall and so
so much hartney if you guys don't know
it's like cruelty free it's not real
leather but they're like designer bags
and so I decided to splurge Ted and get
myself a bag and again oh my god this is
one of those bags that I was looking
through the bedroom with okay let's
maybe I'll go with this one and a half
as a bird on it and I was like okay with
the birds and she was like oh wait we
have this other one too and she pulls it
out from the back and it's the only one
there oh but can we just what I swear to
god it's me in a bag I just this is so
perfect kind of hurt when you saw it
converted into Canadian dollars but it
is so worth it because it has officially
become my pride and joy and I wasn't
sure if I was going to put into this
haul because I didn't want to come
across the wrong way but I also just
wanted to share the fact that there are
designer vegan bags that you guys can
invest in so if you're ever looking to
kind of splurge on yourself or just
spend a little bit more money or like a
graduation gifts that you're asking for
or anything like that
that's what not lady to check out the
Stella McCartney bag I love it it's
cruelty free and kind of change that
like idea in the high fashion world and
they also just like this design it's
just I can't I can't I love it that was
everything I got from parents let's
backtrack and go to all the things that
I got from Scotland which pretty much
everything else in this haul aside from
one thing you know let's do Amsterdam
then I think that's one thing in
Amsterdam Alayna showed me the store she
knew of called we are labeled I believe
it was called and when I walked in we
were like scoping around and I
this on the rack and I just grabbed it
and I was like oh my lower this is the
sweater here it needs to be iron because
I just pull the bed of the dryer but
it's just Levi's sweater the material is
like a nice material for summer where
it's not that thick nice on the inside a
little bit more like not scratchy but
just like I'm really bad at explaining
clothes guys cropped perfectly so you
could wear it with like high-waisted
jeans or with leggings and yeah just as
Levi's across the front pretty standard
the next thing I picked up in Scotland
we went to an H&amp;amp;M there and I know this
is going to just be comical because of a
what I'm already wearing and B the fact
that this is the last thing I need in my
closet but I grabbed this shirt from H&amp;amp;M
it's an ac/dc shirt pretty similar to
the one that I'm wearing but this was
caught like a grey distressed like
vintage style almost to it there's a
knot in the front from when I was
wearing it um
t-shirt dots not included and the last
thing I need in my closet but one of my
favorite things that I probably picked
up if I'm being honest is you guys so if
you guys have watched my Edinboro or my
I think it's titled I jumped a flight to
Europe if you guys watch that blog
you'll know that I also checked out a
record place in Edinboro and it was
called Kota music I believe it was just
at the edge of old town and when I went
in I was like flipping through all the
records with such a cool little store
and I actually found daughters records
out I don't know if you guys listen to
daughter I have heard on a bunch of my
playlist on Spotify which always links
down below if you guys want to check
that out she's definitely more rainy day
vibe I've been really working on
increasing my record collection and this
was one of the ones that I wanted so
badly on vinyl it has all of my favorite
songs from her including one called
Amsterdam I found it I I couldn't put it
back down it was a little expensive 17
pounds which converted to Canadian is
over $30 I mean I could have got it off
Amazon but the story behind getting it
into Edinboro it just felt so much more
right if you guys want I can do a whole
like record collection video I feel like
that would be kind of fun to show you
guys like all the records that I've been
collecting and some of my favorite songs
/ artists yeah that's not that videos
comment down below and yeah I'm going to
probably right after I finish rolling so
all the other clothes in this hall are
from Topshop and I was looking for a
black crop top to wear while I was there
I didn't actually end up wearing it but
it's one of those things that I knew I'm
still going to wear for summer so I
didn't return it it's this one here I'm
a little afraid of what it's going to
look like on because of the girls but I
guess we're going to find out I feel
like if it does end up working this
would be super cute with like maxi
skirts and this hat and the next thing
that I picked up from Topshop were these
shorts here again I just feel like
everything I found on this trip spoke to
my soul in such a way that it was like I
needed to come home with me you know so
these are the shorts that I picked up
they are like these high-waisted light
wash jean shorts with these almost like
orangie red floral designs they have
them on the one side and then along the
back as well luckily these are one of
these things that I've purchased and
tried on right when I got back so I knew
that they would fit and they're like
this is going to be such a staple this
summer I can just feel it in my bones
you know next I got asked a ton on the
Instagram and in my blogs wear my
sunglasses flash glasses work and I
actually picked up both pairs of these
at Topshop in Glasgow so this is the
first one I got access on my one
Instagram where I'm like I'm holding
onto a copy probably not with this
outfit actually knew it this might work
these are the first they're they're kind
of that tortoiseshell outlining I feel
like it's also one of those pairs of
glasses where if I pulled up in a creepy
van I would tell you that I have candy
and try and invite the children and I
might actually see if there's any chance
that I can pop out these lenses and
replace them with my actual prescription
so I can wear these and actually see
better but in the meantime they're
perfect and I'm just going to keep
rocking them anyway because I absolutely
love them especially the days that I
don't have makeup on I just throw these
on and I'm like hahaha
you can't tell that my eyes are naked
those are the first pair that I picked
up and then the second one I wore these
when we climbed Arthur's Seat and again
on my Instagram so many of you guys
asked me where I purchased them so
they're from Topshop and it's what they
look like I feel like I feel like Lady
Gaga with an
which is you want look so funny I got I
got like twice over that trip people
were like right here anaconda and I was
like I don't think I look anything like
any God got me and I wish I had her back
at home you won't maybe I am Lady gaga
you were born this way next I picked up
this crop top here as little as ones
that I was like kind of debating whether
or not I wanted to buy it but then Janie
Genevieve was like no girl you have to
get it I can't do her accent but I love
her and she was like you need to get you
need to get it but like okay fine let me
just continue to spend my maple dollars
so this is the top here is crops
hopefully I can't really see in the
viewfinder right now but hopefully you
guys can see the like floral it's just
completely punched out black so it adds
a little something than it just being
like a plain black crappie and as I
mentioned anything with floral on it
lately I just it just it's completely
justified the floral justifies my need
to purchase it continue to bully my bank
account and then next I picked up this
romper which was also on my Instagram I
wore it when I was in Amsterdam but I
picked it up in Scotland it's just this
little tie dye romper here see it's just
every time I every time I hold any
outfit up with this hat I'm just I can't
it makes so much sense
again super cute for summer a little bit
low-cut but you can tighten it at the
top where the string is and it like
cinches it up so that you don't have to
have it too low kinda cutout shoulders
and really like pretty exact ease please
and then last but not least this is also
something I got asked a ton in my
Edinboro blog and it was where I got
this sweater so I actually purchased
this at the top shop too and someone was
like I've been looking for examined
adidas sweater everywhere but they only
have it in guys well let me tell ya I
don't know if it's like at all the top
shops but the top shop in Glasgow had it
in girls so I would definitely check
online and again if I can find the link
I'll leave it down below but I picked up
this salmon-colored adidas hoodie which
is just life it's so comfortable I have
tried to go all the back of it because I
bought tanner on it so I mean pray pray
for the adidas sweater because let's
just please let the Tanner promote that
is the last and final thing that I
picked up and it really
good purchase if you ask me because you
know it's not like I don't already have
three of these sweaters so that
concludes everything that I picked up
while shopping on my trip I hope you
guys enjoyed and that is a builder need
to know what I was spending all my money
on overseas let me know if your favorite
item went down below / if you guys want
me to do that record collection video
and yeah if you guys haven't checked out
the blogs from me traveling I will link

the new back and I will see you guys all
