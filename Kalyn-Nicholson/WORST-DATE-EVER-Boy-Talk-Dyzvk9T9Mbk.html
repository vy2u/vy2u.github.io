for today's video I'm going to be doing
a boy talk Q&amp;amp;A with you guys I asked you
guys on Twitter to send me all of your
boy related questions so you guys are
following me on Twitter then go ahead
and follow me I'll pop my Instagram up
on the screen as well and also if you're
new to the family be sure to subscribe
I'm currently doing youtuber or I upload
videos every single day for the month of
October there's still 11 videos to go
guys
11 video so without further ado let's
jump in to the boy toss is going to be a
very fun video the proud mum Liz says
how to get over breakups so I actually
did a full video all the breakups and
getting over heartache and all of that
fun stuff so I will link it on the
screen somewhere Sydney door asks
longest relationship so my longest
relationship would have been my
relationship in high school which was
about two and a half years long I think
so Raya Vout Sheva asks the worst and
the best date you've ever had let's
start with the best date I've ever had
we're talking just like first dates or
what I can't choose one in particular
where it's like the best date ever one
of the best like first dates I ever had
was honestly just one of the best first
dates I've ever I can see had an accent
and I'm such a sucker for accents I just
like swoon be honest the whole time he
was talking I was just kind of like oh
my god
Gerard Butler what is up as for the
worst date I've ever been on
in high school I went to a movie with a
guy and it was the first date and it was
just so bad don't ever go to the movies
on a first date because we couldn't talk
and I was really really shy in high
school so it was one of those things
where it was like hi and like his dad
picked us up and the car ride was dead
silent
the movie we didn't really talk he like
awkwardly held my hand and then after
the movie his dad was already waiting
outside so it was just like a silent
drive home so I am that's the worst date
of my life
brie is sick sorry if I messed up your
name
asks the song quote or character from a
book which perfectly describes or
reflects your boy ideal wow that is a
heavy load
question I am afraid to answer it for
fear that I will miss or forget of
another quote or another character okay
so I think for movie or show wise my
perfect guy would be like Enzo from
Vampire Diaries mixed with Julian from
One Tree Hill if any of you guys watched
One Tree Hill Julian is the one that
ends up marrying Brooke and I loved just
how like nerdy and goofy he was but then
I'm also super attracted to like Enzo
who's like kind of more badass and
mysterious so I guess if I could just
take them and match them together that
would be my ideal boy then if I had to
choose in my perfect book boy it would
be Caden from Unleashed or Noah from the
unbecoming of Mara Dyer either one of
those either
or both so Madeleine bandy asks what to
do when you're scared to start a
relationship because you've been single
for so long so this is actually a really
really good question because I this is
the longest I've actually ever been
single so I get it I get like the whole
fear of kind of letting a relationship
back into your life when you've become
so accustomed to being single you know
go with the flow if someone walks into
your life that seems interesting to you
or you seem to enjoy or have a crush on
give it a chance but don't don't think
too much about it don't think about
whether you're single or you're not just
try not to think of it as you have to
either be 100% single or 100 set in a
relationship just kind of feel things
out and see where it goes try not to
overthink that process and just let life
kind of happen as it does so see it dot
asks do you have a one that got away
if so details I I don't think I actually
have anyone that I would consider to be
like the one that got away the great old
White Buffalo
I feel like I've met guys where it's
been like we have a connection but it's
just either the wrong place at the wrong
time but I wonder what would have
happened had it been the right place
right time but I wouldn't say that
there's anyone though that I'm like oh
damn you're the one that got away
so is cute asks eyes or lips hmm I'm
gonna go with the eyes sucker for like
if someone holds really intense eye
contact with me okay damn you got me
pumpkins but as Chloe asks how do you
not blush when talking to boys girl let
yourself blush that is like actually
part of our human nature is the reason
why
females blush around guys is that the
pigmentation in your cheeks is supposed
to attract a boy he'll think it's
endearing and cute you know
so Rhea velch ever asks are you into
someone right now
I mean someone real not Drake or Enzo to
be honest with you guys no there is like
nobody I'm into right now and it's often
like a lack of trying like I've gone on
dates and I've met people I'm just
really enjoying my independence in my
single life right now as much as I
complain sometimes as much as I make
jokes about being like forever alone and
single and moreso stems from the fact
that like everyone around me is sad from
two people is in a relationship in my
life and so I'm just kind of like the
odd man out that's just chilling you
know kind of like that fifth wheel that
little head floating in the background
of the cute couple pictures that's me
leaving that door open that said
honestly I haven't met anyone that's in
a similar headspace or like I don't know
just someone that tends to click and
until I do I'm not going to waste anyone
elses time or my own Christina asks when
did you have your first boyfriend and I
was 15 I was in grade 9 Sadie asks how
to ask a boy out when you're awkward AF
love you by the way I love you too okay
so how to ask a boy out I am myself in
my awkward AF so I get it but when it
comes to guys confidence is key no
matter what you say or no matter what
you do just be sure of yourself this guy
is not the prize you are if you go into
it with that kind of mindset
odds are you're going to be super
confident you're going to be you know
approachable and also you're going to
put yourself out there and if he rejects
you then you're already in the mindset
that was like whatever I was just doing
you a favor ask him if he's really good
at pool and then challenge him to pool
sometime if he's really into coffee be
like oh my gosh no way so am i we should
go get coffee sometime if he's really
need a beer oh my god I'm real also
really in the beer we should go get a
beer sometime and keep in mind that even
if he says no he just did you a favor
because he was gonna be a waste through
time so I'm just a girl 8 asks do you
have any ideas for a birthday present
for a boyfriend when he doesn't tell you
that he wants anything if he's saying
that he doesn't want anything then
instead of buying him an actual present
get something that you both can go to
together whether that be you take him
out for a nice dinner or don't you take
into one of his favorite sports games
find something that he's into whether it
be sports or you know video games
like that and find a way to kind of gift
him in that sense
Galen McKenzie asks what do you look for
in a guy um one of the first things I
look for is maturity Sekou and it would
probably be either like Drive or passion
someone that's super passionate about
something or has a lot of like
motivation and drive for themselves and
last but not least would be someone that
doesn't take themselves too seriously
because then I know that I'm going to be
able to be my weird goofy self without
being judged
Mia asks the number one way of knowing a
guy likes you
okay here is a lesson that I wish I had
learned when I was younger if a guy is
into you you will know he will make an
effort he will want to talk to you he
will make plans with you if you're
getting mixed signals or you never hear
from him or you're always the one
messaging first or you're always the one
putting yourself out there and it's
never reciprocated odds are he's not
into you if a guy wants to get your
attention he will find a way to get your
attention if you're not hearing or
getting any sort of signals whatsoever
could be shy and the only way to find
out in that type of circumstance is to
put yourself out there and you'll be
able to tell on the way that he you know
reacts whether or not he's into you and
if he does like you and he doesn't make
an effort especially if you have made an
effort then he's an alien so that was it
for my boy talk Q&amp;amp;A I hope you guys
enjoyed it let me know if you guys have
any other themed QAS that you want me to
do down below and then that I will see
you guys all in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
