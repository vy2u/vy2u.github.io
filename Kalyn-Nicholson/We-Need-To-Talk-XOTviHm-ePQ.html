I said that to me nah all right you guys
want to go through on some sweatpants
and just you know grab a cup of tea got
a cup of coffee take a seat
cuz we're about to have some life chat
so feel like it's just so overdue for me
to just sit down and just talk to you
guys about all this stuff and yeah so
that's what we're here to do today I'm
just gonna basically tell you guys what
the heck has been going on in my life
for the last few months and like just
explain a lot of things and hopefully
give you guys a better perspective as to
where my life has been that and show you
guys that I swear to go on the lack of
videos the lack of consistency the lack
of just just everything it's just it has
nothing to do with my love or passion
for doing YouTube and everything to do
with just me what's been going on in my
life the circumstances surrounding me
and just me getting in my own head
things have just been kind of weird over
the last few months just like my overall
perspective of life has just been I mean
I think you kind of have to go through
the parts of life
to be able to kind of enjoy the better
parts and I think no matter what happens
in your life whether it be good bad
hurtful or paradise whatever it is you
always can take something away from it
you can always take a lesson from it you
can always learn from everything's but I
just made in terms of just where my
headspace is that I'm just I'm feeling a
lot better and I'm feeling like I'm in a
good place to sit and talk to you guys
about it and also it's Friday and I just
have butternut squash soup so I'm just
like I'm really ready to party you know
okay so it's been brought to my
attention more than once that the
consistency of my videos hasn't been as
great um the quantity of videos as in
how many I'm uploading isn't as frequent
even to me in myself I've brought it to
my own attention that I just for a while
there I would wake up and I would just I
would dread thinking about what I had to
do that day and I was just in a really
weird spot and I'm talking like I think
this kind of came to be right after fall
and I don't know if you guys notice but
as like winter started to carry in I
just kind of dropped off and I stopped
vlogging and I stopped kind of putting
up as many videos and
I did put up videos I wasn't really sure
about them and I wasn't really feeling
all that great about them but I put
something up just so I had something to
show you guys and I don't know it was
just I I mean I know that I am somebody
that I do fall into a rut normally
during the winter months just because of
the weather and it just sends to kind of
bring me down sorry my phone is on
normally it's not as bad as it was this
year and then as many of you guys know I
went through a breakup and and it was
just like I've been moving and then I
broke out in this really bad skin
condition that scarred my body and I had
a really really kind of tough Christmas
I had a pretty tough birthday I just
have been in a weird spot for a little
while over the last four years of my
life there's been a lot of family stuff
going on for me and it's extremely
unfortunate but also I've come to
realize that it's not my responsibility
and it's not necessarily my burden to
carry though it does affect me and that
has been one of the biggest things that
I have come to realize that that was one
of the biggest things that has been
weighing me down is my family situation
isn't all that great and I've never
talked about it with you guys before and
it's so funny to me because it's taking
up one of the biggest portions of my
life and a huge chunk of my energy and
my time and my stress and I have never
talked to you guys about it and I feel
like I didn't because one it affects
more than just me talking to you guys
about it here on the Internet I mean I'm
openly disclosing a lot of personal
information about people that are close
to me and that's not really something
I'm all about but at the same time I
feel like it's important for me to let
you guys know that my family situation
has been completely like it's just been
 and I'm sorry for that language and
I'm lack of a better word but I just
mean it is literally it has not been a
fun time over the last four years it has
been extremely stressful and I really
threw myself into it almost too much and
put too much of my time focused and
energy into it and felt the need to be
this like rock or the stability for a
lot of people that hasn't been a fun
time and I mean it's still going on and
unfortunately I don't really know when
there's going to be an end to it but
I've come to the conclusion of the last
little bit that when it comes to fan
maybe some of you guys are watching this
thinking that there's some stuff going
on in your family life too just because
they are your blood doesn't mean that
you can't withdraw from certain
situations and that has been where I
have been at I have been really pulling
back and pulling away from it all
because though it sucks and though I
love everybody in my family to death
I'm just I'm done with it I'm done with
letting it consume such a huge portion
of my life and yeah that's basically
where I'm at with that so that was a big
thing for me it was a big thing that I
hadn't really told you guys so it was
really hard for me to kind of balance
that out when I felt like it was so
separate from my job and it is still
extremely separate for my job but I mean
in terms of waking up and having the
energy and the motivation to do things
throughout the day it can be very soul
sucking it can be very energy sucking
and it just it's really hard for me to
explain to you guys why I've been in
such a weird spot without being able to
fully explain to you why so I mean
that's what I'm going to leave that one
because I don't want to get into full
details for the reasons that I
previously explained I mean just in
terms of the last year I've gone through
a breakup and I lost a best friend of
mine and one of my longest best friends
and I really and just in general over
even just the last few months have
really come to realize who my true
friends are and who the people that are
there through thick and thin and people
that I can rely on and people that are
just I've just I've had a big life
epiphany I guess when it comes to people
in my life and I think it's extremely
important but it can also be extremely
sad when you see these things happening
or you come to terms or realize who is
in your life because they are a good
person or they are a good friend or they
really care about you and and who's in
your life just because of the sake that
you've let them be there I mean it
really sucks to see how many friends I
have maybe lost over the last bit and
I've gained a lot of friends too which
is really cool and I've really come to
realize who my real friends are but just
in terms of this portion of my life
don't be afraid to cut negative people
out of your life because I'm telling you
it works wonders and feel sad or
nostalgic towards I mean memories you've
maybe had with some people or people
that you really thought were going to be
there through thick and thin because I
feel like friends can sometimes even
be more so your family than your family
and especially at this age of my life
but I think it all works out for the
better and I've met and made a lot of
new friends and reached out to a lot of
new people and I think that that has
been huge for me
yeah it's just been it's been a weird
time and that such situation of my life
and then all in all just as just me and
who I've been I mean I made a video for
you guys called Who am I and that was in
December I think November December time
and I was so consumed with trying to
figure out who the heck I was that I get
I spend so much time over thinking and
over analyzing a lot of things and a lot
of you guys might be able to relate to
that but I don't know if it's just my
anxiety or just who I am as a person but
I tend to sometimes almost think the
crap out of something like I think and
think and think about it to the point
that I create problems that aren't there
I start asking questions that I don't
really need to be asking myself or I
start making connections that really
aren't there and it can it can really
consume you and it takes a lot of my
energy away and it really sucks because
I'm someone that truly believes that you
should spend your time doing things and
experiencing things and enjoying as much
of your life as you can because that's
really the only purpose of being here is
to enjoy the ride and I really I get
resentful towards myself with how much
time I spend you know creating problems
or thinking about problems or just
focusing on the negative rather than the
positive and and I start to get almost
resentful towards myself and then I
start to question myself and and it just
it's a really bad spiral it really is
and I really have come to resent how
much I have second-guessed myself and
become so insecure over the last bit
because that's not normally Who I am I'm
someone that I'm pretty sure of Who I am
and I'm somebody that I don't really
believe that there's any point in not
being there for yourself or not being
tough for yourself because I mean when
it boils down to it at the end of the
day you're the one that wakes up every
morning with yourself you're home that
goes to sleep every night with yourself
you're the little voice inside your head
if you're not going to take care of
yourself you can't expect anybody else
to and I'm a firm believer in that so it
really sucks about how much I feel like
I have been beating myself to death or
really been letting myself feel defeated
by no one other than myself and it's
really
fortunate and I don't like that I've
been in that kind of mindset and been
that kind of person that's where I've
been at and I really had a big huge kind
of moment over the last little bit where
I took a step back and really saw my
life as a whole and not just my life
because generally I'm a very logical
person in terms of situations in my life
I can give you the logical answer as to
I know I'm not damaged I know that I'm
not insecure I know all of these things
and I know I learned a lesson from that
crappy thing that's going on in my life
or I know that everyone's going to be
alright and figure themselves out but
emotionally I'm not connecting that
connection logically I know these things
but emotionally I'm not following it up
emotionally I'm acting as if something
is damaging me or something is making me
feel insecure or I am acting insecure
even though I don't feel like I am an
insecure person emotionally I'm acting
that way if that makes any sense
no matter how much I kept on trying over
the last bit to change my surface
behaviors you know to work harder put
more of my energy and time into the
things I love to do like YouTube and
photography and music and all of these
other things that I absolutely love
fashion writing and spending time with
friends and and really just being with a
happy vibrant person that I know I am no
matter how much I try to change that
surface behavior every time I'd crash
and burn and end up back into this weird
rut because no matter how much you try
and change the surface you have to go
real down and change like the core the
source of what's making you do these
things and I didn't want to have to deal
with those those source things because
dealing with them isn't easy
it's you have to get really real with
yourself you have to maybe cut a lot of
people out of your life you have to
really catch yourself doing certain
things or thinking certain things and
stop yourself dead in your tracks and
and really reroute yourself and make me
extremely difficult because for me
anyways I've been so I've been in this
cycle for so long that the longer you're
in it the harder it is to get out of it
and I think it's not an easy thing to do
kind of rambling here I'm not really
going in any set direction I apologize
but and I didn't I don't want this I
don't really don't want this video for
me to be like a sob story and I don't
want crisis pity or anything there's
no excuse for me to not have been
working as hard as I should have been
but it's just I feel like it's just so
much easier for me to sit down and
explain this to you guys because no
matter how hard I was trying to get
videos done it was like I couldn't just
I just couldn't catch a break and I
couldn't I couldn't just the world I
just needed the world to just just pause
for a second so I can catch catch up you
know what I mean
I don't know if that makes sense maybe
some of you know exactly what I'm
talking about but it felt like
everything was moving so fast and all of
these people were moving on and doing
all these amazing things especially in
terms of on the internet I mean I'm not
the only youtuber obviously there's so
many out there and I'm watching
everybody do all these amazing things
and I even got to the mindset of
starting to compare myself and
questioning myself was I good enough for
this job am i interesting enough to even
be making videos what do I even have to
say like why are people following me I
don't know why people follow me and I
mean it that was seriously where my head
was that and it's just it's it's weird
that I've let all of these outside
circumstances of my life really affect
the way I was starting to see myself and
I really really started to resent myself
yeah again I'm not here to just like
give my sob story I'm just here to tell
you guys that that is where I have been
at and I feel like this video has been
so overdue I should have been telling
you guys all along what was going on but
I just felt like I felt this
overwhelming need to make it seem like
everything was okay all the time for you
guys because a lot of you guys come to
me with your problems your anxieties and
your your insecurities you watch my
videos and it puts you in a good mood so
I just I felt like I had to live up to
that without realizing that you know
it's probably a lot better for me to get
real with you guys because the more real
I am with you the more connected I feel
that you guys know when you're just like
like up until recently a couple days ago
I mean mind you it was like my my female
time but I had a super emotional day I
was feeling wickedly insecure again and
just it all kind of came back on me like
a tidal wave and then I kind of had to
like the next morning I just kind of had
to stop myself and reevaluate yet again
and I don't think it's going to
easy I don't think I'm just going to
flip the switch and be totally cool
again I think there might be a couple
more tidal waves coming my way I'm sure
there are but it's all about just taking
that second to sit back
reevaluate yourself and and really see
how you know what you're doing all right
you're doing fine and I I kind of took a
couple steps forward in terms of other
areas of my life and I wrote myself out
this massive email that I'm going to
that basically was like read me whenever
you feel like is hitting the fan
and so I sent that to myself and I
pinned it to the top my email so that
way you know when I'm feeling those ways
when I feel so kind of defeated I guess
you could say if I read that email
that's me being like you're not defeated
like stop get out of your head stop
having to be throwing yourself a pity
party for one and just stop like it's so
ridiculous how much time and energy I
was spending on these things
and letting them weigh me down and
letting them stop me from being the
person I am and stop me from doing the
things that I love and I really don't
want that to be the case anymore
but I thought the only way to end that
chapter of my life as a whole was for me
to sit down and film a video and explain
to you guys because you guys are so
immensely important to me you have no
idea I tell you guys a lot more than I
tell people that are even extremely
close to me and I mean some I think
that's weird but to me it's just like I
felt I feel very accepted by you guys
and I feel like I can I can get real
with you guys and tell you guys what's
going on in my life and sometimes it's
weird for me to film a video like this
because I know there's people that are
in my town or people in my family that
watch these videos - or friends I know
or friends and friends and that part can
be a little weird for me because like
they see these videos they'll know so
much personal information about me which
is so weird that I'm very willing to
give personal information to you guys
who I mean hopefully one day I could
meet you guys face to face but moving
away from all the heavy stuff guys I'm
feeling like the only way I can explain
it is like the cloudiness in my head is
finally kind of you know moved away and
I really kind of shut a lot of chapters
in my life and closed a lot of doors and
and in terms of family like I just don't
dwell on those things anymore and then
the last hurdle for me is just getting
right back into my mindset when it comes
to work and I feel like I'm finally
ready for that and no matter how much I
was trying to force it before I was
never fully really ready because there
was a lot of going on in my life
that I really needed to deal with but
now I feel like I'm finally ready to go
straight back into it with the right
mindset and I'm gonna try and balance my
life but I'm getting back into vlogging
there's a vlog going up on Sunday I've
been vlogging all day yeah that's where
I'm at I'm just really excited I'm in a
good spot in my life right now and I
just needed to explain that to you guys
and you can either let the weight and
stress of things that are going on in
your life paralyze you or you can let
them empower you and that is exactly
where I'm at I let them paralyze me for
so long that I'm just I'm ready to kind
of flip that around and use that as my
drive to you know thicken up my skin and
really push forward enjoying each moment
and focusing on the moment that's in
front of me and thought you know
stressing out about the past or worrying
about the future so yeah and other than
that thank you guys so much for letting
me ramble to you and thank you for
sitting down and having this life chat
with me guys like this is I just feel
like this is how I talk to like Meg's
like when mags and I have life chats we
sit down like this we're usually in
sweatpants with you and wine or coffee
and we have live life chat sometimes we
cry though I mean I didn't cry it out
with you guys today but I just I feel
like I got to get really real with you
guys and I really appreciate your guys's
time in watching this video and your
understanding in terms of me being able
to tell you guys all this stuff that's
going on in my life I literally actually
can physically feel the weight lifted
off my chest right now for you know
being patient with me and understanding
and for your constant love and freaking
support guys it is insane
you've no idea how much you guys don't
mean to me and I am always just as much
here for you as you guys are for me as
much as I totally can be
so again if there are anything that you
guys want me to elaborate on or make a
comment on video on or have a life chat
with let me know down below maybe we'll
call them life chats yeah so let me know
down below and I can totally start
filming these and love you guys to the
moon back and I will see you guys all in
a future video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
