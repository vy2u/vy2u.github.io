another episode of coffee chronicles for
today's video we are going to be doing
some adventuring we're gonna explore
Toronto a little bit it's gonna be fun
weekend it's currently you Thursday May
17 yes the 17th and actually just too
much ahead at the door I've packed up a
couple blankets some like
battery-operated string lights some
pillows I'm about to switch into a copy
sweater because Bentley and I are going
on a doggy date I ended up finishing off
work a little bit early today so I was
looking up some stuff that I could do
tonight and originally I was like you
know what maybe I'll go see a movie
because it's been something that like I
want to get more confident and just
going out and doing things like on my
own and I'm into the drive-in in years
so I'm super excited Deadpool 2 just
came out today so I figure we'll go see
that if it's not too busy snack on some
popcorn which I checked with the
drive-in and they use oil like oil-based
fake butter pretty much which is kind of
gross but treat yo'self
and we're gonna go we're gonna go see
Deadpool cuz why not you know why not
let's pack some stuff up are you excited
for our date there you go
got your power you've got your cheese
tied to me tight time
who's got
so you like
sweet
for you out
and to me it's starting
good morning good morning happy Friday
hello going on nine o'clock in the
morning I've been up for about an hour
half and ended up sleeping in a bit
because Bentley and I got home pretty
late from the drive-in so I slept until
7:30
instead of 6:30 isn't really sleeping in
let's be real woke up made myself a
coffee and was doing my reading this
morning and I actually finished calm you
know the book that we are doing for the
next book club video so I started a new
nonfiction and I'm trying out numerology
by aunt Christie this is what the book
looks like where she shows like the
number chart on how to figure out like
the numeric value of each letter I
wanted to do my name but I figured I
would do it with you guys on camera
because I'm gonna pop up the number
chart so you guys can do one two an easy
way to figure out different things about
you you're supposed to do like your full
name so let's do Kalyn Marie Nicholson
now let's see what we got here Oh two
one three five nine three and you add it
all up over my calculators I'm not it's
way too early to do math so 18 plus 28
46 so then you add those three numbers
together so I'm adding 18 plus 28 plus
46 and I get 92 so that what you're
supposed to do is you're supposed to add
those numbers together until you get a
one digit number so 92 I would add 9
plus 2 and 1 plus 1 equals 2 so my
numerology number is 2 some reason I
thought it was 8 so you understand the
vibrational energies of your of the
numbers you can choose to wear certain
colors to tap into them hell no I'm not
wearing dark green actually I've got
green booties and they're my favorite my
vibrational energy is the emotion number
2 the energy is caring my planet is moon
sinus and cancer and key word is
feelings and then basically the rest of
the chapters are like going more into
your number but I just thought that was
cool
try day things get some work done
and hit up like a yoga class there's one
at noon so I'm thinking maybe you might
do that I haven't committed yet and then
later on tonight I'm meeting up with
Kath we're gonna go and hit up a patio
if the wind dies down for a drink it is
so freaky when do I just walk Bentley
and I swear to god we almost flew over
like five times gonna let the day kinda
progress where where it naturally does
and I'll keep you guys posted so leave a
comment down below if you guys did the
number chart what was your number
before I go I'm not sure how much all
end up vlogging tonight but I wanted to
show you guys my outfit so I'm wearing
these black jeans are from H&amp;amp;M and they
have like rips and then and then over
top I'm just wearing this white shirt
that I got from forever 21 and I just
tucked it in and through like a black
bra that underneath and then this jacket
has been this jacket has been on my
channel like a million times this has
been an OG jacket of mine for so long
and it was like 20 bucks that are
implanted you know it's cute it's
flattering and if I ever lose it I'm not
gonna care because it's like I've gotten
such good use out of it and it was so
cheap on the jeans I'm just wearing this
belt which is also from I think from
forever 21 urban planet and for shoes
these booties I got from forever 21 this
is like a very affordable outfit I'm
wearing tonight except for my purse my
purse will be the expense of the whole
life I'll shake my expensive item and
then a bunch of you guys are asking
about these sunglasses they are from
Quay or key or however you say it I was
wearing them on my last vlog and a bunch
of you guys were asking questions about
them if I can find them I'll link them
down below anyway this is my sangria
sipping outfit of the night happy Friday
but the free pouring seem really
it's just
post spin juice green juice actually
trying to replenish my vitamins before
heading to the catering taste testing
the venue that I'm hosting the meetup
back next weekend because I'm testing
the food that's gonna be you know
catered and the lattes I do have to say
though I think spinning is gonna be my
new Saturday thing it was so hard want
to be one of those people like in the
front of the class that just like stay
up the whole time I was like I'm a
pretty I would consider myself a
decently coordinated person but it was
it was I was a hot mess
literally and figuratively shears to new
Saturday spinning rituals and vegan
caterers how do you have makeup on and
you got ready so quickly
yeah she's a masha and this is
it really goes
again
and happy Sunday is the poor thing I
just got back from the starving artist I
went in that up with my friend Megan
she's also a youtuber I will leave her
YouTube channel down below we just
caught up I haven't seen her in a while
we're gonna hit a patio Leroux's week
cuz sangria season is upon us tweeted
that earlier caught up a parent the star
goddess is this really cool restaurant
in Toronto there's two of them actually
but you can get vegan waffles and you
can also get potato waffles that are
vegan and they're to die for like in
credible and I needed that brunch
because last night oh my god guys last
night was hilarious I didn't end up
blogging that much because hey I don't
go out okay let's let's just like put
that disclaimer out there I have not
like a club scene kind of person I feel
like we've talked about this before but
we ended up kind of I don't even think
we meant to you're initially just kind
of gonna go for drinks and then it
turned into like we kind of ended up
going to like clubs not really clubs but
we went to bars and like hit up the
dancefloor and I'm not keeping you I was
sweating buckets and I could talk about
this in another video cuz I don't want
to like burn up too much of you guys
it's time so I don't know how long this
blogger he is but I'm somebody that like
I don't like to drink very often and
when I do drink I don't drink a lot like
I don't get drunk very often at all and
it stems a lot from an anxiety that I
have which is again what I mean when I
say we can talk about that in another
video if any of you guys want to hear
more about that or if you relate to that
at all I can definitely make a video on
it but it just like it's something that
it's like an out of control thing I
don't like when I'm too drunk and it's
not even the drunk part it's the knowing
you're gonna be hungover knowing that
the next day is kind of just completely
torn and I don't do well with that for
some reason but I had so much fun last
night and this morning I woke up and had
one of those moments where I was like
waiting for it to kick in waiting for
that anxiety and it just didn't it's
like I'm gonna get super mushy with you
guys right now because we still have
some interesting
today I haven't tore up an answer like
that and so long and just like hung out
with some some gals you could tell like
all four of us were just having a blast
last night and I just like I needed that
I still needed that dance party but I am
a long hungover today it's the moral of
the story and surprisingly got some
ovaries I thought it was gonna be but
I'm a little hungover I'm very excited
that it's Sunday because now that I have
waffles and my belly potato waffles to
be exact I'm going to just basically
spend the rest of today jesting about
lean I just went for a nice long walk
it's beautiful and shantou which makes
me feel a little guilty about not going
and doing something but the last four
days I feel like I've just been like
filling out my schedule today I just
wanna like zone out do some laundry you
know prep myself for next week and end
off this vlog was a true gist because
would it even be a vlog on our channel
if we weren't jesting let's be real
there you put a hair mask in my hair and
yeah we're just gonna have literally the
chillest day ever the last few weeks in
general I feel like my mentality has
been challenged my spirit has been
challenged because obviously dove is
going for a breakup and like just in
general there's always gonna be growing
pains when you have to like separate
from something you're used to in your
life and so this week it's been
challenging but this week has also been
so rewarding and so today I just feel
like I wanna bask in that energy and
just let myself be a little hungover and
I think that's important I think we
should all do that and just just then
today I'm just gonna say it ends the
very first week of me vlogging every
single day
when I said that these videos we're
gonna change my life it's already
happening in front of me right now what
you guys can't see I pulled a tarot
reading last night I'll show you this is
my tarot reading it's a very very
intense one I literally left it out to
charge in the moonlight that I am that
person everything coming through is
basically saying getting seeds of change
that there's been like an end of an era
in my life and I need to just push
forward from pushing forward I'm like
and from talking about it and also a Moo
there's like multiple cards that says
I'm gonna be moving and the wheel of
fortune which means destiny apparently
destiny is at play right now and then
this card is my favorite this one keeps
popping up and it's all about friendship
and I think that this one that's kind of
good my goal lately you know to just
like really build all my friendships and
just hang out with some fun people and
like good people and just surround
yourself with that good energy and
apparently destiny is just gonna take
care of the rest
so I've been getting really back into
Tarot again it's kind of like reading
your horoscope it's just like a cool way
because you you can interpret the carbon
in a way that fits to your life and so I
think this week I might go get an actual
like tarot reading done at the rock
store you know I am gonna do that I'm
gonna make that a thing this week I need
James just like read my fortune or read
mine at least read my Tarot
I guess not my fortune but in the
meantime just
carbon is clean my name is Sun
tarot-card tapestries up you guys will
see like a full review on both of these
things I have a summer haul coming up of
like decor clothing books and all that
stuff so those will be in there but
they're actually from Urban Outfitters
