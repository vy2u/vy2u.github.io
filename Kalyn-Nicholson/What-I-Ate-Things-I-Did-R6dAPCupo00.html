by 7:00
it's what what time is it 9:30 7:00 9:40
9:45 we definitely slept in sunday
boarding but for you guys it's probably
Monday so happy oh my labs Monday the
second Monday in a row now that I'm
doing this but first and foremost coffee
always and forever
you
fives
I can
howdy so I'm gonna update you guys on my
day so far after our run we went out for
lunch for Father's Day with my dad and
my grandmother and my sister um and then
I basically got this like butternut
squash with like a realist sandwich so
that was pretty good
and then after that so I ended up coming
over to my mom's house I was looking at
parcels I picked up the parcel that I
had here I grabbed my new triangle
bikini which I am bringing with me to
California just gonna be so exciting I
leave in how many days wait is it
I leave in nine days guys that's insane
I leave in like a week that is so crazy
there's so much to do before I leave I
can't even think about it all so I'm
about to head home for a little bit I'm
gonna charge up the drone I feel like I
just feel like if you're like taking the
drone out today you know it's one of
those days so also if you guys are
wondering what I'm wearing this romper
is from the lookbook store I will leave
a link to it down below and yeah so
that's where my day is that so far I
can't wait to try on my bikini I really
hope it fits
keys are one of those things that like
when you get them and they come in the
mail it's like the test of all times
when you try on your bikini for the
first time
Oh
way
so if it just became very apparent to me
how much I need to clean my apartment
and a blare some tunes that's what I'm
gonna do why don't you come a bit closer
to my side just for a little while
cuz it's alright
oh I feel your skin feeling skin on my
head oh I feel your skin skin on my yes
I feel your skin feel your skin on my
head off in your skin feel your skin
so it's 724 got a bunch of my apartment
cleaned which is nice but I just like
did you ever have those days you feel
like no matter how much you clean it
just seems like everything still looks
so dirty to you because that's been me
today I haven't made dinner yet so I'm
thinking that I'll probably do that now
and then I'm going to fly my drone for a
little bit I feel like you know testing
of the drone I need to be practicing it
more before I go on my trip so I think
my dad's gonna come over since this
Father's Day we were already hanging out
with him earlier but I think my dad's
gonna come over and we're gonna try out
the drone and do some fun drone footage
and then yeah I think my friend
Christine is gonna come over for a
sleepover and we're gonna do like face
masks and all that stuff because my skin
has been breaking out like crazy I know
it's mostly hormonal but it's just still
I just I feel like cleansing my skin's I
hope you guys enjoyed this my life

bit more chill than last Monday's since
last Monday's and like was a bunch of
camping and a bunch of fun stuff like

more entertaining as time progresses I
will get better at it i pinky promise
and if I don't then I will look back on
this and you guys can take this video
and link it to me and be like you said
you were going to get better and you
didn't so I'm holding myself accountable
