trying desperately to find a place of
good lighting so we can chat
so let's chat for today's video I'm
going to be doing it when I eat in the
day slash like share with you guys
basically the workout that I did today
well two workouts that I did today so to
begin this morning for breakfast I got
up around 6 a.m. and I just went
straight for the coffee I was working on
dreamcatcher super early this morning
before I took my brother to school so I
didn't eat breakfast right away I'm
somebody that I tend to feel kind of ill
in the mornings if I eat breakfast so I
usually like to wait like an hour too so
I had coffee and then I had more coffee
and then after that for breakfast I
actually made myself toast with pumpkin
butter which is something that I
recently found at farm boy it's amazing
and it's my favorite thing to put on
toast and I sprinkle a bit of pumpkin
pie spice on top and then the coffee
that I had with my breakfast I also
sprinkled pumpkin pie spice on top of
that as well so that was the breakfast I
had after my breakfast I actually did a
40 minute yoga with adriene video it was
the greeting the day one so I did a 40
minute yoga session as for lunch I was
working with a friend today so we got
burritos for lunch and yeah it was
pretty good from this place cuz Kasana
I get the veggie burrito lots of wacom
only as for a late afternoon snack I had
a massive bowl of vegetable soup I've
been really really into soup lately
because it's been so chilly here like I
have the windows open in my apartment so
it gets nice and cold inside here and
then for dinner I'm going to be making a
stir fry I'll share with you guys my One
Bowl stir fry takes me 1 bowl to make
this meal this is like my super lazy
girl hack and it has been saving me
through you Tober guys you have no idea
I've been working such late nights that
I have no time to make dinner and I have
no time to do dishes so this was like a
one step stir fry bowl so I start by
making basmati rice and
I like basmati you can make any kind of
rice you want but I prefer basmati I
just like the texture of a better as a
taste of it better and then I add this
bag of Italian style vegetables they
have some sort of seasoning on it that
tastes amazing so I pop that on top and
then I usually sprinkle some cilantro if
I have like lettuce or anything just to
add a little bit of crunch I'll add that
in basically it's like throwing whatever
you want you can throw chickpeas you can
throw in fresh veggies and then I add
teriyaki I add mustard I add like a
roasted garlic paste as well a dill
paste and yeah that's pretty much it I
mix it all together it sounds disgusting
but I swear do not knock it till you try
it
and even if you don't do all of the
sauces and like the topics that I did
you can really just throw on like any
sort of topping at all sometimes I'll
just do mustard I've done balsamic
vinegar I've done past the sauce I've
done even ketchup which sounds gross but
again it's a Canadian thing but don't
knock it till you try it that's like my
lazy girl hack to dinner whenever I
don't have time to eat but I'm still
trying to eat relatively healthy and
then after dinner I'm going to head to
the gym I'm probably just going to do
like 30 minutes on the stair climber
considering our need in yoga today but
yeah so that's going to be like the gist
of my workout for the night as for water
I refilled my Blogilates water bottle
twice today which isn't that good like
I'm trying really really hard to get
back into the habit of drinking more
water it's like a huge goal of mine
right now I honestly feel like water is
one of those things that I have to
almost like build up my tolerance to how
much I drink a day I can't just go from
not drinking very much water to chugging
back like two to three litres a day so
right now it's a slow progress but we're
getting there I cannot believe we are in
the fourth week of youtuber the last and
final week what is going on October flu
bot so I want to explain to you guys
just something really quick about this
last week of you Tober I have been
working on you tober since August and
it's crazy because I was so far ahead of
the schedule I was so ahead of the game
I'm so organized and then like always
you can't plan for it but life happens
and so many things ended up happening
throughout the month of October and so
many unpredictable things that it kind
of threw me off pace and it threw me off
schedule and now I feel like I'm super
behind but a lot of stuff that's been
going on
kind of behind the scenes in terms of my
life and it was all unpredictable and
all things I couldn't control and I feel
like it's one thing to mention that I'm
actually very surprised at how I've
handled everything this month by the big
project that I took on with you tober
and working on as much as I have on
dreamcatcher and then all of this just
like background things just exploding
I'm learning to kind of manage you know
like anxiety like I should update you
guys on that because I know this week is
going to be a very stressful one for me
and I don't know if you guys noticed but
I've been like a little bit at my a the
past a little bit on social media and
it's just like one of those things where
I'm trying my hardest not to get
stressed and keep my show gonna go
through phases where everything comes
naturally and everything comes easy then
you're gonna go through phases where
life is like haha lol just kidding I'm
gonna throw everything at you at once
and see how well you juggle I am going
to work my absolute butt off I will not
sleep if I have to just to make sure
that I stick to my promise of getting
all 31 videos out this month I refuse to
let you guys down there will be a video
everyday this week and they're not going
to be half-assed either I will make sure
that they are good videos and I trust
that everything's happening for a reason
and everything's happening exactly as it
should and when it should because if I
didn't believe that I think I'd lose my
mind so I hope you guys enjoyed this
episode of you Tober and what I eat the
day I know you guys have been requesting
seeing a lot more of these and other
than that I will see you guys all in
tomorrow's video which is a spooky one
by the way
bye guys I know you
I used to be sweeter but I prefer you
I prefer better
before you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
