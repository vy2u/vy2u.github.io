for today's video I wanted to do another
meal prep Monday with you guys like I
promise I'm going to be uploading these
videos every two weeks or so and sharing
with you guys just a bunch of really
healthy vegan meal prep ideas this is
the second one and if you guys didn't
see the first I'll pop it somewhere up
on the screen or down below so
definitely be sure to check out sure
it's a fun way to share with you guys
what I'm eating and some awesome vegan
recipes so if you guys want to see my
meal prep for this week then just keep
watching please so to start out I
actually made this exact smoothie in my
last meal prep Monday video but it's
because it is still my go-to I just use
one banana a cup of frozen fruit and
lately I've been using the Korea
Carribean oh my lord
treasurer because it's so good and I'm
loved and mango lately and then I just
add my chopped Rica lean protein and my
maca powder again same as last time the
protein powder is chocolate in maca
powder it basically like balances your
hormones and it is the most amazing
thing that I've ever introduced into my
life and then I blend it all up with a
little bit of spinach poured into a
glass and drink it so that's my morning
smoothie and then I tend to have this
with a cup of fruit on the side so each
week I've been doing a different type of
fruit and this week grapes were on sale
so literally just washed up some grapes
and then dispersed them amongst 7
different containers
and as for my snack I made it nice and
easy I just took a bunch of plastic bags
and I like to recycle mines to try and
reuse your plastic bags and then these
Goodson's which are just basically rice
crackers and again two boxes amongst
seven different days and then I just
pull out my garlic hummus and I eat them
and then yeah that's pretty much my
first snack of the day and then as for
lunch one of my latest obsession says
making chickpea tuna guys I'm having
problems with my camera lately so it cut
out some of the stuff that I filmed but
it all I did was take a cup and a half
of chickpeas and then I cut up some
vegetables you can add any veggies you
want I've added pickles olives before
but this today I just did onions carrot
cilantro and some green onion and then
once it's all in there you just take
some mustard and or you can take vegan
aids but I did mustard and again my
camera cut out so it didn't get to show
you guys the part where I mash it all up
but I literally just use the potato
masher and that is it that's all you
have to do and it's so good it's kind of
like a tuna salad but a healthier
version because it's chickpeas and it
clustered and I eat this on salad or you
could even wraps or tacos or however you
want to eat it you know and then as for
my second snack of the day again
same as always my obsession my naked
bars are so good they're still like made
out of natural ingredients and they're
super yummy
and for dinner I decided to mail pop a
honey garlic stir fry so I just started
with some basmati rice and cooked it all
up and then I took some vegetables some
mushrooms red onion red onion what am I
saying some red pepper and some white
onion and I grilled those up and sauteed
them and I just use a little bit of
water instead of oil and I added some of
those shredded carrots on top too and
then I just took the cooked rice some
honey garlic dressing probably not the
healthiest but you know what this is
just a healthier like meal in general so
you know we can we can give ourselves
some leniency here and then I added the
green onions mixed it all up and added a
little bit of pepper and Himalayan salt
and you want to use Himalayan salt
because it'll keep you from bloating
it's actually healthy for you better
than table salt and then just a tiny bit
of garlic powder
super-easy so yummy and then I just put
in all the bowls and served it on up she
was smiling and this part is optional
that I like to add a little bit of my
favorite frozen veggie blend when I go
to eat it just to add a bit more veggies
and just add some more substance to it
but that's literally it so that pretty
much concludes what I eat in a week or
what I eat in a day however you want to
call it and if you're wondering but what
about dessert oh I got you the only
thing is my camera doesn't got you like
I mentioned it didn't record half of
this and it's really upsetting but I'll
leave the actual ingredients down below
and the recipe down below for this
chocolate walnut banana bread super
yummy and it was actually really really
healthy and very minimal in terms of
making it in the ingredient and it
turned out amazing so don't worry I got
you we will not forget dessert that we
just
I thought let's save it for my weekly
meal prep if you guys enjoyed be sure to
thumbs up or let me know down below your
enjoying the series and yeah if you guys
