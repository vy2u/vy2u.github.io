me
when you cut it
hey guys what's up and welcome back to
my channel for today's video I decided
that I wanted to do a what I eat in the
day when I'm traveling so I thought that
with starting this up on my channel I
haven't done of what I eat in a day and
so long figured if I started doing them
this would be a cool one to do because
this could be like a what I eat in a day
while I travel just in general too
lately I feel like my meals have really
shifted and changed in 2018 I've been
eating a lot more Whole Foods I've been
eating a lot more even just like raw
meals and things like that I've noticed
a really big change in how I feel like
my skin how I sleep my overall like
energy throughout the day even just like
my body I feel like my body has changed
a lot this year and so I figured why not
film on what I eat in the day also not
to mention I'm currently in Arizona it's
my last day here and because there is so
many things that we're gonna try and do
we being Bentley and me ending off this
whole day with a juicy Mexican meal in
the desert that said welcome for the
first meal of the day it's currently
breakfast time I went to Trader Joe's
yesterday I bought a ton of fruit and
I've discovered that I actually like
that cantaloupe or honeydew and I get
used to absolutely hate watermelon
honeydew cantaloupe anything that was
any kind of melon I used to hate it and
I discovered last night so snacking on
it last night - that actually actually
liked it down to go refreshing and of
course it can't forget also drinking a
coffee but meal number one a big juicy
bone
I try to start my day with some cold
water coffee and a big bowl of fruit I
find if I eat raw at the beginning of
the day it really helps with my
digestion and such so I need this big
bowl of fruit and then I think I'm gonna
have a fruit bar snack and a little bit
when we had it to the gardens so meal
number one in a dramatic line
this
dawnie
never spooky you
but it's in my
the shooting
No
so it's going pretty close to 1 p.m. I
just made myself some lettuce tacos I
had some apartments and salsa is a bit
of a snack when we got back from the
gardens cashew cow wasn't open yet so
I'm gonna head there after this and grab
some vegan ice cream also with my newest
obsession has been kombucha my sister
has gotten me hooked so I got this one
yesterday from Trader Joe's it's Organic
mango kombucha which is fermented black
tea but it's so good so it's gonna be my
drink with Miletus tacos and lettuce
tacos themselves
there are sweet potato ribbons mushrooms
peppers zucchini jicama cilantro salsa
and some seasonings my daughter seems
really good
ding am I
okay so it's rolling in to dinner time
and I'm let's head out to this place
called tumeric oh it's like a vegetarian
Mexican place where they change their
menu every single day which I thought
was really cool because obviously it
means that they're sourcing from like
local places normally when I'm traveling
I like to try and find like good vegan
places to check out or places that are
vegan friendly for instance recently I
was visiting my sister in Ottawa and I
decided to try out this restaurant
they're called grow your roots and it
was so good so whenever I'm traveling it
I like to try and dabble in as many you
know vegan restaurants as I kind of new
cities just because one obviously
because I'm vegan but two I feel like
it's always really cool to try out and
like not only that but I feel like you
vote with your dollar you know so I like
to support vegan restaurants especially
smaller ones like grow your roots this
place called tumor Co and all of that
fun steps but if I am at home I've been
making a lot of just like summer dishes
like Buddha bowls and salads tacos I
made tacos the other day with Larissa
and just like trying to make the
healthier version of my favorite foods
at home to save money for one and two if
I'm gonna go out and eat I like to save
it for when I'm traveling or if it's
like a weekend thing with friends and I
find that it just makes it super easy to
kind of stay healthy for the summer
so with that getting to try out this
Mexican place it's my last night here in
Arizona so it definitely want to get me
some good Mexican food before going home
the cashew cow we're gonna have some
time to kill belly night tomorrow before
our flight so I'm thinking I might go
back and try out some more flavors like
the lemon poppy seed I got cookies and
cream and coffee and it was like out of
this frickin world even places like that
I love to try and scope out some of my
favorite foods but like the vegan
versions especially when I'm traveling
so with that said I'm gonna go tried to
Mirko and I will return back with a full
result on how good it was although
Bentley and I are gonna also gonna go
for hikes I don't know when I'll return
but I'll return
so finish off this what I eat in a day
those tacos were the most like I'm
devastated because I thought I found
like the best tacos ever and they were
in Toronto but those topped them and now
I'm about to fly away from that but in
all reality so to Mirko if you guys are
ever in the area and you decide to go
there menu changes every single day
because they source stuff locally but
their food was incredible and there was
a picture of the guy from diners
drive-ins and dines there so obviously
it's a good it's a good spot and with
that you guys got a little peek at what
I eat in a day travel edition along with
some of the foods that I've been eating
at home and when I went and visited my
sister and all of that fun stuff if you
guys enjoyed this video just give it a
thumbs up and let me know them below if
you guys want me to continue doing these
back home if I start filming these at
home especially with the fact that I've
just been loving cooking lately whenever
I show you guys meals I could even throw
in just like a what I eat in a day slash
my workout of the day if you guys would
want something like that I could even
just do a full fitness routine let me
know I'm thinking about getting like a
Fitbit watch when I get home because I
want to be able to like track my sleep
track my steps I've been obsessed with
tracking my steps lately and trying to
hit 10,000 steps a day I've been failing
more recently and thousand steps is
super easy when you're traveling but a
lot harder when you're at home aside
from that leave me a comment down below
what is your favorite meal right now
because I can also remake some of your
guys's favorites vegan healthy addition
if you guys want and share with you guys
more recipes and pop them up on the
screen as I do it I love you guys since
I'm in the back thank you guys so much
