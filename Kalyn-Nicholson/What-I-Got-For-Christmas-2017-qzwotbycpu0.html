12 days of Camus today is the last and
final video in my 12 days of Camus
series just deeply upsetting so right
now I'm actually just finishing up
editing I just edited today's video and
uploaded it and now I'm about to go head
it to the nail salon I have an
appointment to get my nails done I think
what I want to do is get baby blue like
a really nice wintery baby blue and then
get silver on two of the nails and then
later on tonight Gregg and I are
actually gonna head to the Christmas
market in Toronto which was another huge
thing I wanted to get down on my
Christmas bucket list we're gonna knock
that one off tonight - like brewed
myself a coffee and brought my little
bed tray and it was like he was honestly
I had the best time editing for the last
two hours but it is trying to go exist
in the real world so say goodbye to my
red festive Christmas nails and hello to
my space buns because I was feeling a
little extraterrestrial Christmas nails
chick so Gregg is actually on his way
here to pick me up a robot's head to the
Christmas market in Toronto it's
actually a really warm night out so
don't judge me I'm not wearing a coat I
obviously won't be wearing these
slippers but I am going to wear just
these leggings and then I put on a
sweater this is like a giant sweater
that Greg actually got me but underneath
I have another sweater so I layered two
sweaters on top of each other but it's
like plus five plus six that said I'm
super excited to check out the Christmas
market I have never been to the
Christmas market China before so I'm
hoping I can get some Christmas shopping
done because I have a lot still left to
do and if not that I hope that I at
least just see some festivities you know
oh it is now December 22nd it is Friday
it's for 48 and I just finished packing
up to go to Kingston I'm gonna be
heading there tonight hopefully with
Greg if he gets done working time also
since then I watched the Polar Express
which pretty much was the last movie on
my movie bucket list
aside from a Christmas story tonight I'm
gonna make some gingerbread cookies to
bring with me to Kingston for both my
Christmas dinners it's so good so
that'll be scratched off the list I'm
all packed up and ready to go at this
point mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom
behind them I thought you might be here
to tell us to have a break and I'm
hoping to bake the cookies run it to the
pet store so that Santa can get his
gifts ready for and eat some dinner and
then hit the road that's kind of the
plan if all goes well I'm hoping that
you understand you ain't the man at sell
you into man
just pray to God keep you in the plan
so I have made it to Kingston and
Christmas shopping could officially be
no truffle list that was very stressful
I didn't really get as many vlog clips
as I don't I'm gonna make Greg stop at
Starbucks so that I can get my
peppermint mocha for the year because I
haven't done that yet right we're doing
a bunch of tapas and gifts at my dad's
Greg is here so just realizing why are
you coming for him if there's enough for
all of us and everybody could win but
you keep spending all the energy on
things that don't apply t I keep doing
things that you would more than probably
got a good I keep doing things that
teachers told you not to try and school
and you keep saying that it's going with
someone my saliva
a black solid black
No
but the word
these are so sick
my hockey pictures for my crazy tsunamis
this is for judo up and sell you when to
man you Justin oh honey why least and
they lame they always say
what's up guys so I don't remember the
last time I even walked we've been in
Kingston now for a few days and I've
been trying so hard to get this part of
the video filmed and uploaded but it's
just been crazy we've been running
around back and forth between both sides
of my family and I just didn't want to
like you know Russia but we are actually
just about to check out of our hotel we
stayed downtown Kingston I'll show you
guys the view from our window don't miss
Sun look at this it's like so pretty
oh how familiar you guys art with
Kingston you can see Wilf Island over
there with like the windmills okay it's
not you can see wealth island just like
such a pretty snowy view but we are
actually just about to check out and
really quick to finish off the vlog I
don't even know how much I ended up
vlogging I think it's a pretty Christmas
Eve logon to finish it all off I wanted
to share with you guys all of the stuff
that I got for Christmas so really quick
before we check out I have a bunch of my
Christmas gifts right off to the side a
lot of them I don't have with me so I'll
give you guys the highlights some of my
favorite things since I actually have a
garbage bag full of stuff and Christmas
was crazy this year I'm not gonna lie
there's a lot of stuff to bring back I
feel like my jeep's going to be back
some of the Christmas money I got I went
and grabbed the original like polaroid
originals one step to one type camera
that and some black-and-white film so I
grabbed that with some Christmas money
that I got from my Nana I also grabbed a
new day planner that this one's like
it's from Urban Outfitters and you
actually can play it out like more
details in your day I also with some
Christmas money picked up some workout
stuff after this sports bra from Under
Armour grabbed this sportswear all this
one's like my favorite the reason lately
have been drawn to this color and baby
blue and then I grabbed the matching
shorts to go with it for working out and
this is what they look like from my
sister this is gonna be completely
randomized because everything was just
thrown in here from my sister one thing
I really really wanted for Christmas is
here and it's really bad luck to buy
your own tarot cards so she picked me up
the wild unknown tarrant and so this is
what it looks like and I've been doing
everybody's readings I've been bringing
them to my family dinners they are super
cool and yeah I want to like get it down
to the point that I member
them but I'm so in love and then this is
the deck itself and I'll show you guys
they're really cool like the art on that
and such are really nice so those are
the Terek cards that I got I got a
couple mugs this mug is from my brother
and it says Pisces and then this mug was
from Greg and it says warning coffee
first of NV talk which is a hundred
percent true and I got one of these like
I heart coffee it's basically like you
filled this up with cinnamon and then
you can use like the stencils to make
really cool designs on top of your
coffee Greg got me a Rugrats hat and he
grabbed a matching one too so I feel
like we're matching right now we're
wearing white on top and black on bottom
yeah movie tickets yeah family got some
so you got more than and then Greg
grabbed me these which are the Apple
bring up you're on again okay I grabbed
me the air pods is that what they're
called back yeah they're the air pods
where they are wireless and they just
like go in your ears I'm so excited to
use these to run another indigo gift
card this is a travel you put your
photos in and stuff which is really cool
this for my dad and his girlfriend
and just because it's like it's more
old-school you know you put it on your
coffee table and then people can look at
photos of you traveling around the wound
my brother also grabbed me this it's the
vanilla coffee candle and then you can
actually use the mug afterwards as a
real mug and other thing that Greg got
me this Nightmare Before Christmas shot
glass which we don't actually take shots
like ever so I'm gonna take shots of
espresso in it
I got pots and pans because I needed
some new cooking stuff this is another
really cool gift from my sister and her
boyfriend
I collect really old vintage cameras and
I've collected three and I stopped my I
stopped collecting for some reason and I
was talking about how I wanted to get
back into it so my sister actually found
this it's a Kodak tourist too and I
believe it's from 1952 so it's this
really cool old vintage camera that my
sister and her boyfriend got me to add
my old vintage camera collection Wow
yeah yeah thank you anyway
a lot of my stuff is still in Greg's
Chuck so there's still some stuff like
from my mom that I can't show you guys
Oh candles this one is the peppered
suede which smells so good but one of
the last things that I have to show you
guys I think is this this is called the
giving jar and what you do is you write
your recipe in the book fill up the jar
and then you pass it along and then the
person that you give it to eats
whatever's in the jar then they fill it
up and pass it along so those are some
highlights of the stuff that I got from
Christmas leave a comment down below
letting me know like if you guys
celebrate Christmas or whatever you
celebrate if you guys got any gifts let
me know what you guys got and aside from
that I think I'm gonna end the vlog here
since there's not much more aside from
one more dinner and I hope you guys
enjoyed this last 12 days of camus I'm
sorry it went up a little late but I
hope all of you guys enjoyed some loving
time with your friends and family as
well and thank you guys for being so
patient while I did the same other than
