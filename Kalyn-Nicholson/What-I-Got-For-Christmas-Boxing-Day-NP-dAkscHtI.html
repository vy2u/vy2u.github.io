point to just a heart you tease you
none of these toys always to draw you in
a week
good morning guys it is 9:42 in the
morning can you guys see that yes you
can I just dropped my brother off at
school got ready and I'm about to film
like literally guys I have so much stuff
to do today so I'm going to block as
much of it at I physically can I just
refuse to make myself stressed out at
Christmas time so despite all the things
after do today I'm in a chipper mood
beginning today
Oh
fragrances Eve guide so I just woke up
as you guys probably saw and switched
into some jeans and a leather jacket I'm
going to pick up my sister my brother is
here with me I don't know exactly what
the whole plan is today but you guys
will see because I'm going to be
vlogging
let's go because I need some caffeine
like pronto
all the small things true care
I'll take one lift your ride
Merry Christmas guys so it is officially
Christmas Day well Christmas night now
I'm heading back to my grandmother's
house which is the clips that you just
saw before this to spend the night there
I hope you guys all had a safe and happy
Christmas with your families and that
your bellies are full and that you guys
are you know happy and excited for the
new year so I figured to end off the
vlog I could do a little kind of what I
got for Christmas as well as show you
guys what I got when I went shopping on
Boxing Day that said quick list glamour
I feel like obviously this is kind of an
obvious statement but just to make it
clear Christmas is not about obviously
what you get but few of you tweeted me
asking me to show you guys a little what
I got for Christmas and so I figured I
would share with you guys some of the
pretty cool things and yeah so for my
brother
I got a little file folder that's Kotla
it's like tan marble detailing on it and
it says make your dreams happen and this
is going to be super helpful for
organizing in the new year because I
have a lot of organizational resolutions
for 2017 and he got like a matching book
or like journal that I can use with it
so I think I'm going to start using
these for work now and then my brother
also picked up this book here for both
my sister and I my dad read it and it's
kind of like another version of the you
are badass it's called the subtle art of
not giving a as well as this really
adorable K mug that he got from I
believed indigo yeah from indigo and
it's got like darkly on the inside so
that was the gift that my brother got me
my mom got me a bunch of things but just
to give you guys some of the highlights
there is a mahogany teak wood candle
that she purchased from Bath and Body
Works and it's like the double scented
another really cool thing that my mom
got me for Christmas was this here I
showed this to you guys earlier in the
vlog there's a really funny story behind
this this picture was like one of my
favorite pictures when I was a kid
because it was of my stuffed Ernie this
guy right here I was like obsessed with
him when I was a kid I took him with me
everywhere and this is a
sure I believe when I was in Toronto and
I held it up in the car and my dad took
a picture of him and then when they
printed them for whatever reason I
decided to frame it in this good old
Nikes frame yes guys literally like from
the 90s and my mom found it and I used
to hang this up in my bedroom when I was
a kid and she gave it to me as a gift
which I thought was pretty damn cool a
big box of Tupperware for meal prepping
because it was one of the things on my
Christmas list she also got me this
really cool Buddha board where it's
supposed to be like this super
therapeutic thing where you draw however
you're feeling that day you don't really
think about it you can draw a smiley
face you can draw whatever you're
feeling and then it fades off by the
next day so you can do it all over again
so my sister and her boyfriend picked me
up a brand new tripod which was one of
the like highest priority things that I
asked for this Christmas because I
accidentally broke mine a few months ago
so amazing and then from my dad I got
some other things from my apartment he
and his girlfriend picked me up this
thing here it says dream and it lights
up it's so cool I think they were kind
of going for the whole dreamcatcher idea
so I'm gonna put this up over my bed in
my new apartment which I'm so excited
about a pillow that says I love you to
the moon and back because I've only
recently started to notice how much I
say this to you guys at the end of all
my videos but they noticed it and they
picked me up this pillow which I thought
was really cute and so that is going to
go in my new office
and then my dad also got me a few other
like smaller things like pajamas and
like a gift card to Starbucks as well as
this like engraved box that I don't have
with me but it also says to the moon and
back on it and on the inside it says to
Kaelyn love dad and so I'm going to use
that to keep kind of like special
mementos and little things in and then
ask for Boxing Day shopping so my
grandmother really quick she got me
these socks that say if you can read
this
it's coffee time not talking time she
gave me and my two siblings some money
for Christmas and she can't really see
and super super generous of her so I'll
show you guys the things that
technically Nana Nicholson got me so the
first thing that I picked up were a new
pair of boots
I think eyes know I'm like obsessed with
my thigh-high boots but they're healed
so I picked up some new thighs that are
flat on the bottom and these are from
spring they go all the way up and then
they tie
around your thigh so I'm actually going
to be able to wear these more casually I
went to H&amp;amp;M and I picked up this jacket
here it's like a long black trench coat
I'll try it on and do a cutaway clip for
you guys really quick yes so I picked up
that with Nana Nicholson's money as well
and then quickly some other things I
picked up while Boxing Day shopping was
this like thinner it's almost like a
silk bomber jacket and it's in this like
Beijing taupe color and then my sister
and I took a little stroll over to urban
planet which I bought a few things from
there too including like just some
bralette Scott like the envelope it's
really hard for me to show you guys but
it's got like the envelope opening so
it's just a kind of like a blouse
material a blouse / almost like a day
roll so I currently have it tied in the
back but you could leave it open kind of
like a cardigan or you could tie it at
the front and make it like a blouse to
bra let's one in this like almost peachy
beige color and then black some meshed
out leggings and then last but not least
I picked up a little silk tank top that
just looks like this and then last but
not least I went and checked out the
Boxing Day deals at Lululemon and I
picked up some stuff off the sale rack
so I'll show you guys what I got first I
got this gray it's kind of like a crop
umm it's I don't know it's cut it's
different than anything I own i fact of
it so this was on the sale rack for like
40% off I've come to realize that as
much black as I do where I don't have
much black casual where I have a lot of
like black dresses black leggings so
yeah it's just this zip up like athletic
sweater it's got a bit of a like cutout
at the waist so it's super flattering
and then last but not least are like
these loungewear pants that were also on
sale they were like originally 118
dollars and I got them for 79 and so
this is what they look like they have
this like salt-and-pepper detailing and
they're just they're like not baggy but
they're not tight they're like the type
of pants that sit right between
comfortable leggings and sweat pants
I need more loungewear guys as I have
either like pajamas or stylish and I
just need a little bit more like lounge
in between I left out a lot of stuff but
it's because I don't I don't know I just
wanted to show you guys the highlights
of the few things that I got this course
like I said it's not about the gifts but
I want to give the people what they want
