the what I got for Christmas tag I
believe it is and this has been very
very highly requested since I started
the Christmas countdown people have been
asking me to do this video where I show
you guys after Christmas just basically
everything that I got so that is what
this video is going to be and I'm just
gonna jump right in because I do have a
decent amount of things to show you now
just like a little bit of a disclaimer
obviously Christmas isn't about what you
get it's about what you give to other
people and spending time with your
family and all that fun stuff so I just
want to say that just to get out of the
way that like I'm not a big
materialistic person but this has been
this has been very really this has been
very very requested so I am going to
film it basically just going to jump in
on the things I got some of the things
I'm going to show you are things that I
purchased with like either gift cards or
money that were given to me so that I'm
not just showing you guys basically gift
cards throughout this entire video so
I'm going to show you some stuff that I
actually bought with the money that I
was given for Christmas as well so if
you know me then you know that I have an
obsession with slippers and I got quite
a few pairs this year one of them I'm
wearing right now if you guys can see
them I will take them off to show you so
this is the first pair that I got and
they were from Ryan and they're just
like these little huggy type slippers
and they have like the fake fur right
here and like these little tassels in
the back and they're super comfy the
next day zippers I got were also from
Ryan I believe he took the hint that I
really wanted slippers so these were the
other pair and these ones are really
cute they're a lot like the pair that
you guys have seen in a lot of my videos
that have been my favorite pair for like
two or three years and they just have
holes all over them so these ones are
probably going to be my name is go twos
and they have this really cute like
wintry pattern and some pom-poms and
then the last pair of slippers that Ryan
got me were from Victoria's Secret so he
went on to the website and he got me the
little flip-flop ones that I wanted in
cheetah which is nice because I either
wanted the cheetah print or the pink
print and they didn't have pink so he
got me the ones in cheetah and they have
like the V as symbol and these ones are
really really nice if you're super hot
and you just want to kind of walk around
in something that's comfortable but
don't want to put on like the of each
types this one these ones are really
really nice for that reason the next
thing I got me was from the body shop
and it's this really really big I don't
even know how to explain it's like a
gift bath set so it's in shea butter
which is one of my favorite scents and
it comes with it comes with a giant body
butter some shade sugar body scrub
so some shea perfume some to shave
beautifying oil which is dry oil for
your body hair and face some shower
cream in some shape body whip which is
like a body lotion so a couple of the
other things that Ryan got me included
these sweatpants that he got from
Victoria's Secret as well and there was
another pair that he got me that were on
backorder so they're not in yet but
these are the first pair they're just
these black Victoria's Secret Pink
sweatpants so you roll over the top and
it says pink all over them and then it
just says pink down the sides and I've
pretty much been wearing these every day
since I have gotten them so these are my
new sweatpants so the next thing Ryan
got me was also from the Victoria's
Secret website and it is this sweater
it's in like a grey tone to lilac if
that makes any sense and it's just kind
of like a baggy sweater in the front and
then in the back you'll notice that
there's like a twist in the back so that
is that part I thought was the front so
that's why I wore it the first time but
it's actually supposed to have the twist
in the back and it's just like a nice
cropped baggy sweater and next Ryne also
got me a Taylor Swift calendar so next
one of the things that my dad got me was
actually one of the glass mugs from
Starbucks if you guys don't know I have
one that has like black
I mean it's white with black hearts all
over it so he went and picked up both my
sister and I a new one and this one is
really cool so this one is white and it
has all these black almost like sharpie
floral designs all over it and then it
says the Starbucks and instead of the
logo they just left a white open circle
which is cool because I find it's very
like classic and chic and then again you
just pop off the lid and you would use
it like a mug but you can also travel
with it you just want to be careful
because it is ceramic so that is the mug
that my dad got me my dad also got me a
bit of money and I'll show you guys
where that money went towards and he
also picked Ryan and I up
sixty dollar movie gift cards so Ryan
and I we like to go to the movies but we
don't go as much as we hoped we would so
this will be nice because it'll inspire
us to get to the movies more often and
it's $60 to movies which was very very
generous so some of the things I got
from my mom were pretty cool I'm not
showing you guys everything I got from
everyone because it would just be a
super long video and especially like my
mom she likes to get us like little
little tiny things to like like razors
and shampoos and candles and a lot of
that is still over at my mom's house so
I'm not able to show you absolutely
everything but one of the cool things
she got me is this so rip it's like this
I don't even know what kind of bowl this
is but it's microwave proof and I if you
guys don't know I am vegan so or I eat a
plant-based diet so I try I cannot have
dairy so I'm not able to make
microwavable popcorn so this bowl is
really cool because what you would do is
you would just put kernels in and this
one doesn't even need boil or anything
which is good for me because I also try
to eat low-fat high-carb so you would
just put all of your kernels in this
bowl and it pops and you can just make
your own like homemade popcorn without
all the extra added stuff that
microwavable popcorn usually has next my
mom also got me a calendar and it is the
vintage travel calendar and what my mom
actually does when she gets his
calendars every year it's kind of like a
tradition she goes through and she'll
put stickers and stuff on every single
month where anyone has a birthday so
it's really cool because when you hang
it up especially for us kids like my
sister and my brother and I we can see
who's in our family's birthday it is
without having trying to remember
everybody and she even went in and put
like our friends birthdays and our
boyfriend's birthdays and all that fun
stuff too so that was really nice of her
and it's a really really cool calendar
as well another thing my mom got me
which was something I was asking for was
new pajama pants and actually not gonna
lie this is my only pair of pajama pants
I actually don't like to sleep in pants
so I technically don't 5 very many pairs
I would rather wear sweatpants around
the house but I really wanted a nice
pair of pajama pants and she even got me
fluffy ones and they're just like these
white and gray
she like leopard print and they're super
soft and comfortable and I'm probably
gonna be wearing these a lot but I
definitely won't be wearing them to bed
because like I said I hate wearing pants
to bed so they're not my second
Christmas dinner we did a secret santa
where everyone kind of it was this
really cool game where everyone was
opening gifts and then at the end like
you can you can steal people's gifts or
you can open up your own gifts so I
ended up actually stealing a gift so I'm
gonna show you what I got from there um
a lot of you guys might have seen this
first part of it but yeah the first part
of it was a Starbucks mug and I had like
hot chocolate and stuff inside of it and
I stole it because I wanted it as a
daily like morning mug so that is the
mug that I stole the next thing was the
Ryan actually grabbed this from my mom
and this she ended up getting the selfie
stick and he took it from her because I
wanted it so yeah I got a selfie stick
for Christmas that actually happened but
yeah so it's one of those sticks where
you can like put your phone on it and
it'll be good for like vlogging and
stuff but I odd honestly just thought it
was hilarious and I wanted it so I got a
selfie stick and last but not least we
got these photo glass coasters and I
actually again this came with the
Starbucks mug gift and I like literally
needed this gift because Ryan leaves
coaster marks everywhere he goes because
of his protein shakes we're gonna put
pictures of cities in this and then just
basically use them as posters so that I
have two so I don't have to continue to
clean coaster marks off my coffee table
so that's nice so next I'm just gonna
show you some of the stuff that I got
with the money I was given for Christmas
so one of the things actually I got two
of these is a new iPad case because you
guys know I recently got an iPad so this
is the first case that I got the other
one that I got isn't here yet it's still
in the mail but it's basically just one
of these pink cases and you just throw
it on your iPad and I got this from
Amazon so yeah so that's one of the
first things I got and I believe it was
only like ten dollars also got two new
phone cases and I got these off of the
Victoria's Secret website since they are
having their semi-annual sale I decided
to use some of my Christmas money
towards it so this first one you guys
have probably also seen it's tiger print
and then in silver on the bottom it says
pink and it just have my phone in that
one now and this
one is the Victoria's Secret one and
it's a hard clay hard case for the
iPhone 5 as well and it's just white and
hot pink stripes and then there's like a
gold band on the bottom that says
Victoria's Secret so I'm saving this one
because I'm actually going on vacation
this month I'll be going on vacation in
about two weeks so I picked up a bunch
of stuff from Victoria's Secret for my
vacation and this is the phone case that
I picked up so I picked up some bathing
suits from Victoria's Secret which is
really cool because I love seeing the
bathing suits people gotta have an
obsession with bathing suits so the
first bathing suit I got was this one
here and you guys'll notice I have a
little bit of an obsession with animal
print so this is the first one and it
just has like this tropical floral like
Hawaiian print and then it's outlined in
cheetah and the straps are cheetah as
well and then it just goes along the
side and then the cool part is is it has
like these three straps and it does it
on the top too so this one is probably
the favorite one that I got from
Victoria's Secret and I also picked up
the matching bottoms to it so how do
these go like this
so I also yeah I picked up the matching
bottoms and again they're just like the
tropical print and then the sides are
cheetah so next I got this tiger print
top and this is one of the bra tops as
well tan not really orange it's more so
tan beige and white with black tiger
stripes and then it has a little bow in
the front which is really cute and the
bottoms I picked up for those ones were
these ones here they're just like the
black ruffle bottoms and they have like
the little detailing right here in the
back so those are the bottoms that I
picked up to go with that one and then
the last bathing suit I got was just the
top I didn't get a bottom for this when
I have a lot of meetings it's already so
I'm planning on mixing and matching this
with white bottoms but it is just this
like halter type top here which I
figured would be nicer because I'm a bit
busty or so this one I find is nice
because I could take the padding out of
this one and I just find it kind of
gives me more lift and so this is what
it looks like here it's a really cool
like neon pattern with like pastel
colors and neon colors mixed together
and a little bit of metallic silver I
also got just this crochet crop top for
our trip to and this is just a throw
over my bathing suit
when I'm walking to the beach walking
back from the beach all that fun stuff
and I'm sure you're died probably wear
it a lot in the summer as well so that
is the little fringe crop top that I
also got from Victoria's Secret and the
last thing I got I cannot show you
because it is hooked up right now but
with the last little bit of money I had
with for Christmas had been given for
Christmas my sister and I actually went
out and bought refurbished Wiis like the
first generation of we so we went got
those and we got Mario Party and a bunch
of controllers and basically for like
three nights in a row now we've just
been playing Mario Party with me my
sister her boyfriend and Ryan and it has
probably been the most fun I've had and
forever since the graphics on the Mario
Party are like the old-school graphics
that I remember playing when I was like
a lot younger so yeah the last thing I
actually ended up getting was a
refurbished old-school Wii
so that pretty much ends the whole so
that's a pretty much general idea of
what I got for Christmas this year I am
so thankful for everything I got and I
had a really really nice Christmas and
got to spend it with lots of family
which is nice so I hope you guys enjoyed
this what I got for Christmas video be
sure to leave a comment down below
telling me some of your favorite things
that you got for Christmas and I will
see you guys all in a future video bye
