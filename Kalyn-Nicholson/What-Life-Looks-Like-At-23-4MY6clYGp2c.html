to meet Wow
forgive me ma'am it would grow up then
get this no sense - AHA needed any say -
get the pieces thank you you love the
views I thank you a big picture then you
keep me forever
that was beautiful at all PMAG PMAG five
what's up guys so it is now Sunday
especially Sunday afternoon with
Hollywood 2:30 we're just going to hang
out for the night there is no more
company coming until tomorrow what is
our plan I don't even think we have a
plan at this point I'm feeling really
really really gross and sluggish so I
think I need to shower and get ready but
the biggest plan of the day is that
we're going to PI and if you guys are
from Toronto you guys might know what PI
is but for those of you that aren't pi
is like an incredible type of place
that's kind of like our plan for dinner
but if I come out we don't really have
much of a game plan let's see where this
day goes
No
yeah
I
yeah
have to know
have you guys
Oh
again
so everyone is officially gone my sister
just left we woke up this morning we
went for a drive we grabbed coffees and
went to this like bagel place to get
sandwiches now my apartment feels like
eerily quiet so I have a few hours
before Minnie gets here she's a girl
that I went to California with on my
Kelley trip last summer I've been best
friends with Minnie since we were like
four so she's actually going to be here
in a few hours
and then we don't really have much of a
game plan tonight I think we're going to
go out just for like some drinks and
some apps and so it's 11:30 in the
morning it's really warm out so I'm
debating maybe running outside today but
first things first I'm going to do some
cleaning and then so working out with
some showering and some getting ready
because life doesn't stop on Mondays why
are you judging me you're judging me
with your judgey eyes you're upset I
went to the bagel shop without you
aren't you
happy birthday you're 23 question
Melissa McCarthy is the best way to turn
23
please
you
I am officially 23 years old actually
I've kind of been officially 23 years
old for about a week now funny because
when I was younger I used to think that
when I turned 23 I was going to be like
married or be getting married at 23 and
like thinking about having my first kid
and all of that like when you're a young
that 23 seems so old when you actually
hit this age you realize that you're
still so young I definitely it wouldn't
have ever been able to anticipate what
my life would have looked like or what
it actually looks like a 23
Oh
on
in a lot of ways I am like extremely
surprised and in a lot of ways I'm not
the feeling I have is just like I'm so
grateful I don't think I change anything
that's led me to like this moment you
know I have that feeling like I'm
exactly where I need to be and that in
itself is an extremely comforting
feeling thank you guys for being not
only a huge part of my birthday but just
a huge part of my life I love sharing my
life with you guys I love hearing about
your guys's life and just I don't know
I'm so grateful for you truly oppe I
hope you guys enjoyed my first days
welcome so sorry about so late but as of
today the videos are back on a normal
schedule Monday and Wednesdays and I'm
going to be doing all vlogs this month
so we're going to see how this works
because I have a feeling that I kind of
have a sense of what direction I want to
start taking my channel which is just
like a whole other ballpark we can talk
about and another time the love you guys
to the absolute land of that thank you
guys for everything you know just for
existing as Matt I will see you guys all
in my next video bye guys
