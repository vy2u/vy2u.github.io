hey guys so for today's video I am going
to be filming a what's in my gym bag
I've done this video before but it was
quite some time ago so this is like an
updated what's in my gym bag if you guys
are enjoying the fact that Fitness
Friday has been coming back just go
ahead and thumbs this video up I have
already started my next Fitness Friday
so you guys would like it to come a
little bit sooner than planned then just
go ahead and thumbs this up put a hint
as to what it might be just check out
this shirt in the video so if you guys
wanna see what's in my gym bag then just
keep watching so one of the first things
in my gym bag is always my running shoes
since I don't like to wear them to the
gym because they would get dirty and if
I can find the link to my running shoes
I will leave them down below but I
definitely have those in my gym bag and
the next thing I have is deodorant
because of course you're gonna be
sweating at the gym so it's good to put
on afterwards especially if your going
to be seeing anybody or not going
straight home to shower it's good to
have some deodorant in your bag and then
of course I like to be safe than sorry
so a box of tampons is necessary not
only for me but just in case somebody
else needs it as well as some
all-purpose wipes to wipe off my makeup
or just to use to wipe down if I'm not
going to be able to shower right away
and a pair of socks and a lock to lock
everything in place as well as some dry
shampoo because again if I'm not gonna
be going straight home to shower I like
to use some dry shampoo so that my hair
doesn't look super greasy
and then as for clothes I like to keep a
headband to secure my hair back and
collect any sweat and you will find out
how to make this headband in a future
video as well as just an extra pair of
clothes in case like I said I won't be
going straight home mostly most of the
time I do go straight home but just an
extra pair of clothes just in case and
then in the little pocket I like to keep
perfume hand sanitizer lip balm and
extra pair of headphones and then my
standard Victoria's Secret headphones
for my actual workout itself so that is
everything that was in my gym bag I hope
you guys enjoyed and I'll see you guys
all in a future Fitness Friday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
