for today's video I'm doing an updated
what is on my iPhone since I recently
picked up the iPhone 7 my old phone got
smashed from with the fourth time last
year I have the worst luck with iPhone
screens last year so right before
Christmas I picked up a new iPhone and I
kind of reorganized it and I feel like
I've become more accustomed to the apps
that I actually use and just like how I
organized all my apps and things like
that
what's your mind days you guys aren't
following me already we'll go into all
of this but I'll pop my Twitter my
Instagram right here on the screen so
you guys can go ahead and check that out
and follow me and without further ado
let's go into what's on my iPhone ok so
when I first picked up my phone there
was like four different color options
and the one that I thought is the matte
black on the back and the black front
and I wasn't taking any chances this
time I do not have a cute phone case and
I don't even care anymore it's a black
film case it's actually got a kickstand
on it too so if you're ever just like
watching videos with it and stuff you
can like use the kickstand and keep your
phone sitting straight up and I have a
little bit sexy glass or like fake glass
sheets over top of the screen there's no
way I'm smashing this phone okay and
Holly that's all black just matches
everything and it matches my soul in my
life and everything else so it works ok
so when you first open my phone the
background I'm going to scoot over you
know you know like top the screen here
so when you birth up with my phone it is
just a little picture of Bentley from
Halloween and is Batman costume and
again it's just
little thing ever so that is the phone
screensaver that I have for the
lockscreen so when you first open my
phone
the wallpaper screen is of James Dean
and Audrey Hepburn I believe and I'm
just obsessed James Dean I think he is
literally the bee's knees and all into
the old classics watching my photos so
that I see photo I have and I'm not just
a fall in pictures oh I liked it and
then okay so on the bottom of my phone
we'll start there I have my messages aka
like texting and iMessage pretty
self-explanatory besides that I have my
Instagram and I'll go into the video
once we get to like the photography
folder I'll share with you guys how I
edit my my Instagram but as for my
actual Instagram handle I'll pop it up
on the screen here so you guys can come
follow me and the next to that I have my
Twitter so I use my Twitter a lot so if
you guys are following me definitely
come follow me on there because anytime
that a video is going to go up late or I
have any sort of updates for you guys or
I'm going to be doing meetups especially
I was coming I've want to plan a meet-up
for Toronto so definitely make sure
you're following my Twitter for those
types of things I also tweet a lot of
like quotes and pictures and music that
I'm listening to and just stuff like
that with snapchat then next to my
Twitter I just have the phone app for
like calling again self-explanatory and
then on the very very top of my
homescreen
I have my notes I use my notes for a lot
of to-do lists so I have like my 2017
resolution 2017 video topics it's gonna
have like my grocery list for today
actually I have like moving to dues
because there's still some things I
haven't finished in terms of moving in
terms of making a note I'll go through
it with you guys at the very top I'll
usually just put the date so I'll put
January 16 and then I'll put like two
doctors and then what actual data so
they've Monday and then underneath that
I just hit a little bit checkmark and I
start just writing down the check marks
of things to do so like work out
groceries and just things like that and
then as the day progresses I can go on
here and check it off like I've already
finished my workout for the day so I'll
check that off and it also scents up
with my laptop yes that's kind of I used
to keep Oregon it's in terms of my phone
beside that I have my gmail and then my
Safari which is just
sorry and my Spotify was again if you
guys aren't following me on Spotify
definitely do that I have millions of
playlists so I'm always updating them I
workout playlist chill-out playlists R&amp;amp;D
country like everything forever faves
which is a bunch of throwback that I
always have been throwing in my blog
lately so definitely I can check out my
Spotify if you guys have it I will need
to somewhere up on the screen here and
see you guys can check that out and then
when you like scroll to the next page at
the very top I have my snap pad but if
you guys aren't follow me on snapchat
pop it on the screen here typically my
snapshots are always just like Bentley
things I'm doing with like a timeslot on
it if I'm seeing something pretty that I
just wanna take a picture of but it's
not instagram-worthy I'll usually
snapchat it things like that so
definitely come check that out and the
next day I have my vCard it which is
kind of like it's almost like a moon
board I use this all the time when I'm
just feeling like I need some
inspiration or even a certain loo that I
want to express that sounds Sol and so
aesthetically pleasing and it's also
kind of like a dream board so allheart a
bunch pictures of places I want to go or
photo ideas for Instagram of things like
that my tumblr is next to that and
definitely follow my tumblr okay and you
found an email that was asking and it
goes in and I got the activate because I
wasn't using it so what I've actually
decided to do instead is anytime you
guys want to write into me anything at
all whether it be advice questions or
you just want to send me a little
message definitely do it on my tumblr
you don't even have to have a tumblr if
you go on to my tumblr page and hit the
ask me or I believe the ask me button
you can write in anonymously you don't
even have to put your name and that way
if you ever just need advice or anything
like that
I'm going to be doing Tumblr Tuesday's
we're going to set aside an hour every
single Tuesday just to answer a bunch of
tumblr inboxes but also on my tumblr I
basically my tumblr I just like my happy
place is where I read blogs a bunch of
really positive quotes and positive
photos and just like laundry left sides
and it's super zen and then next to that
I have my Facebook which if you guys
want to follow my facebook page I'll pop
it up on here I'm always posting my
videos on
err and just like cool memes and things
like that so definitely check out my
Facebook page if you guys haven't done
that already
so next underneath that the first album
is my photography all on camera my
photos and then my plan Holly and you
guys are wondering what playing Ollie is
it's basically just like a way to plan
out your Instagram it's good for
businesses or like branding and
marketing and things like that and the
underneath ah
I have faith tune which I use vsco cam
which I use Avery which I sometimes you
I haven't used whirring and then the
rest is just like Pinterest and like
apps to connect my like cameras to my
phone so I can download pictures from my
memory cards and my ego live app which
is just like a live streaming app in
terms of editing a photo I'll always
start on visco so I'll start with the
photo and the first thing first I always
use lately I've been using actually
since the fall time I've been using HP -
so I'll throw it on there and if it's a
little too dark you can adjust it and
then I go back into the actual
adjustments I'll lighten this one up a
little bit I always play off the
exposure to make sure all of my photos
are generally the same lightness and
then I'm going to put up the contrast
one as well and then I go over sometimes
those turned down the saturation if it's
a super warm photo but this one might be
okay I'll do highlights same clefto and
then I go into temperature and I drop
this down usually one or two depending
on how blue it looks I don't like my
photos to look too blue and then in the
tint I go up usually one or two and then
skin tone I go negative two so that is
everything that I do for the photo and
then I save it and then I bring it into
facetune and this is where the magic
happens take the whitening tool and I'll
kind of whiten around me just to make
the whole photo just a little bit less
like colors if that makes any sense and
then that's it sometimes I'll take the
details tools or it just makes them
stand out so I'll take the detail tool
and kind of run over the areas that I
want to talk more in the photo and then
take the soften tool or the smooth tool
and I'll like smooth out things in the
background so that is unlike my recent
filters / Instagram see
in terms of my upload formula which I
know I'd shared if you guys in the fall
so my most recent uploads formula it
just kind of like my close up faraway
close up far away beside the rest of my
phone is super boring but besides some
photography folder I have a boss folder
this is how I put my calendar my banking
my phone app my ease which I used to
like check my period this is so clutch
if you are girls download this app it is
so helpful favorite part about this is
the cycle scope so it's like I'm on day
5 of my cycle it just kind of gives you
an update on based on where your
hormones are I can tell you why you
might be feeling certain ways and it
makes me feel less crazy and so and then
beside that I have duolingo and this is
what I've been using to learn French
which is a huge goal of mine for 2017 so
I just do a bunch of French lessons and
you can learn so many different
languages on it I'm starting with French
and the next year I'm hoping to do
Spanish and then underneath that I have
YouTube which you know represent and
then next time I have audible and then
sign now audible I just use for all my
audiobooks
love audiobooks like when I don't really
feel like listening to music when I get
ready or from driving somewhere I always
throw an audiobook and then on the next
page I have my old email aggressive my
folders are pretty boring there's knees
which just has music app store settings
whether all the boring apps Catholic
calculator basically apps that you need
but hence the title needs besides that I
have random which is all the apps that
they throw in your phone that you can't
get rid of and I don't even care or use
really any of them so I'm going to go
through those of you guys and then
underneath that I have lifestyle so in
here I have my tinder app Starbucks uber
jiffy bitmoji and uber eat so basically
all the necessities Hoover eats being
the highest ethnicity and then besides
that is just one called music and again
just a bunch of the ads that iPhone
forces you to have and I sue them in
there because I don't use any of them so
that is it for a what is on my iPhone
set and I hope you guys enjoyed make
sure to let me know down below what your
favorite app or if there's anything that
you guys are recommending that I maybe
download
not using definitely share all your
secrets with me and I was an that I will
see you guys all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
