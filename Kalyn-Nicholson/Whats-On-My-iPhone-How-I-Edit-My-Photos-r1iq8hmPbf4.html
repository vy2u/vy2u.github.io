to be doing a what's on my iPhone video
this video has been really really highly
requested to do this as well as like how
I edit my photos and I get questions
about it a lot so I just decided to film
it for you guys since it's obviously
something you guys want to see
I just don't know apologize if my voice
kind of cracks out at all or it sounds
funny um I'm just getting over getting
sick so my voice is a little bit um kind
of raspy I'm just gonna jump in and show
you guys what's on my iPhone starting
with the case so my phone is the iPhone
5 and I have it in white with the gold
on the back case that I have on my
iPhone is a Victoria's Secret case that
I got a couple months ago I would say
like a month and a half ago here and
pink stripes with a little gold like
label on the bottom that says Victoria's
Secret as for my phone background it is
a picture of a beach and I have my
background as that because I just find
especially if I'm like stressing out or
especially if I'm feeling anxious or I'm
just stressed out if I see a picture of
a beach I feel more at ease so once you
open my phone I do have a pass lock on
it the background to my actual phone
itself says let your dreams be bigger
than your fears your actions louder than
your words and your faith stronger than
your feelings so um as you guys probably
already know by now I'm someone that
loves quotes it can give you a positive
perspective just like that just from
reading it so the first page that opens
up the I'll start with the apps on the
top of this page so the first page it
has Safari on the top Starbucks which is
just my Starbucks app and I am a gold
member now so I don't really bring the
card with me I just always end up using
the app to pay for everything so it's
kind of nice to just have it on your
phone beside that is we heart it which
you guys know I'm obsessed with so I use
this app a lot when I'm trying to kill
time or when I just feel like looking
through fun pretty pictures so or if I'm
uploading a picture to it myself this is
usually I do it from my phone and then
beside that is obviously my Twitter
which if you guys aren't following me
I'll put my Twitter down below so you
guys can go ahead and
so on the bottom thing that stays the
same no matter what the first thing I
have is messages because that's probably
the most used app on my phone so then
obviously beside that is Instagram
because that's probably my favorite
social media app would be probably
Instagram so I just have my Instagram
beside that and again I'll leave my
Instagram down below if you guys aren't
following me so you guys can go ahead
and check it out then beside that is the
mail app and that is just because I do a
lot of my emails for work on my phone
and then beside that is the little phone
app so that if I need to call somebody
it's just easy and it's right there when
you swipe the page to the next one I
have three folders and then an app so
the first folder I just randomly called
it important stuffers that I have it's
music the second one is maps the third
one is settings the fourth one is
8tracks now if you guys don't follow me
on a tracks I'll leave it down below but
basically eight tracks is a app where
you can just listen to all different
types of playlists that are created from
created by people all over the world so
I have a bunch of playlists on eight
tracks but I also listen to a bunch of
other people's playlists on in a track
so then beside that is my Facebook
beside that is my banking then the App
Store weather clock and then when you
swipe there is the iTunes Store sign now
which basically just lets you sign
things on your phone if you don't have
obviously like a faxing machine or a
printer or whatever beside that is an
app called seven cups of tea and that
was shown to me by a subscriber recently
that's just basically a community where
you can go and talk in in to talk to
different people or you can talk in chat
rooms about your anxiety or depression
or just things that are bothering you so
if you are someone that suffers from
that type of thing you might want to try
that app seven cups of tea it might be
helpful for you I haven't been able to
check it out quite a bit yet but I know
that it has been helpful for quite a few
people's after that there is calculator
then reminders then videos then FaceTime
then notes then contacts which are all
things I'm not going to show you guys
because they're pretty basic apps that
everyone has on an iPhone
so the
next folder is just labeled with the
little camera mode icon and it's just
basically on my photo editing apps so
the first app is just the photos where
you go in and you look at your folders
the second one is camera third one is
snapshot right now it's open to my
YouTube snapshot so I will put that down
below so you guys can add me on snapchat
but I am going to take a picture right
now and stop it
so I'm about to put this to my story so
if you guys are following me on snapchat
you'll know when I did this okay so now
I've put in snapchat below that is after
light and this is probably my number one
most favorite photo editing app okay so
I'm gonna use this photo because this is
the photo that I used recently or
uploaded recently to Instagram so I'm
just going to show you basically what I
did and then usually the first thing I
do is I go to the little like settings I
don't even know what that one would be
called but it's not the filters it's the
settings and the first thing I like to
do is take the exposure down just a tiny
bit usually around 25 and then I'll take
the brightness and turn the brightness
up then turn up the contrast about 20
about 15 to 20 I'll turn up the contrast
turn the exposure down one more time and
then that's it and then I go and I
scroll over and there's a little thing
that has an X and that is shadows so
I'll take that and usually turn it all
the way up and it kind of gives it this
more vintage you look so I'll show you
guys the difference there so yeah and
I'll usually hit that and and another
one else sometimes use is the little H
which is highlights and you can turn
that down or up and it just gives it
more of that vintage you look but lately
I haven't been really doing that and I
usually don't really put much of a
filter on all my pictures anymore but if
I'm going to I usually go into guest and
hit R Us but that one's usually my
favorite with after light but I don't
really use filters that much anymore so
that's usually what I do with after
light
next is face tune so usually with face
to not only use this to just smooth out
my skin a little bit okay so usually
what I'll do is I'll zoom in
to hit the little smooth which looks
like a little teardrop and just start to
like run my finger lightly over little
areas that are like really pixelated I
will hit okay and then export it back to
my camera roll
next beside that is the it just says
Kaelin Nicholson but that's because it
is my website so then below that I have
vsco cam or vsco cam and if you guys
have been watching my videos for a long
time I did a selfie video last year
where I was using vsco cam or vsco cam
and that one used to be my old favorite
I don't use the filters I just go to the
little screwdriver or the little wrench
or whatever and I take the brightness
and usually or the exposure and turn it
up and then usually export it and it
just looks a lot brighter and more
colorful square ready is pretty
self-explanatory it's just like white a
gram you can make it so that there's
white around either the top bottom or
the two sides or you can actually make
it so that there's white all the way
around the border beside that is photo
meer which is usually what I'll use if
I'm going to be doing something that has
a reflection so it'll make it look like
this in the sense I like duplicates both
sides then if you flip the page the next
one is perfect photo which I don't
really use anymore but it can help with
pixelation pic collage which again I
barely ever use but I like to keep it if
I need to make a collage or pick our
pics art which is good for overlays so
but I rarely ever do those things so I'm
not going to show them to you guys
because I'm not even that well trained
with those apps I just kind of have them
for like here and there photos when I'm
playing around the next folder is random
and in random I have candy crush which I
am slightly obsessed with I haven't been
as obsessed with it lately just to open
it to show you guys where I last took
off I wasn't that up there in the levels
but I'm at level 168 so that's not that
great but I stopped playing it for a
while so I was playing trivia crack for
a little while with my friends but I
haven't really played it in a while
again I played it for about a week and
phone apps I find unless they're like
puzzles or something like candy crush
for some reason they can't keep my
attention um
I kind of like mindless games so trivia
crap was not a mindless game next beside
that I have countdown and on my
countdown I just have one countdown and
that is for Taylor Swift so below that I
have an app called reward style award
stylus and hat for if you're uploading
like an Instagram photo and you want to
leave the links to your outfit in that
photo that is what lets you do it so the
next to that I have a Groupon Groupon
gives you like little coupons and stuff
for things going on in your area so if
you wanted to get like a cheap massage
it'll send you cheap massage coupons or
like kickboxing classes and just travel
like stuff like that it just gives you
cool little coupons for really cheap and
expensive experiences besides that I
have Ober and that is just for being in
Toronto mostly below that is voice memos
which I never use compass which I never
use Game Center which I never use stocks
I never use newsstand I never use a
passbook which I never use and then
beside that it is just the calendar and
I keep it there because I am someone
that I was constantly asking what day it
is that is basically what is on my
iPhone this was such a highly highly
requested video that I had to do it for
you guys I also got to show you guys how
I edit my Instagram photo so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'll leave on
the apps down below that I talked about
in case any of you guys want to try out
the outset I use myself and other than
that I will see you guys all in a future
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
