to film a video then you can play with
your toys all you want hey I feel like I
haven't even said hi to you guys yet I'm
drinking out of my cup to celebrate the
fact that I leave in 9 days to go to New
York and yes it's going to be in my leg
Monday don't you worry or today's video
I'm filming I was on my iphone this
video has been requested for a very long
time
and though I've told you guys multiple
times kind of like what apps I use to
edit photos and all that stuff you're
going to find out all of that again
it's still commonly asked question for
me so we're just going to go through the
whole freaking phone I'm going to show
you everything I'm going to show you how
crazy I am about organizing this thing
and also I just figured it would be a
good time to do it because I smashed my
phone on my California trip when this
one came in I didn't back up my old
phone to this phone if that makes any
sense it was like not filled with a
bunch of photos I didn't need anymore
and absolute I didn't really use so I
figured it'd be a good time to do it
what's on my iPhone because it's exactly
the way I want it right now I just have
an iPhone 6 just the normal one the case
that I have on it is actually really
really cool it's not a company called
because of a case when you buy them a
portion of the proceeds go towards
mental health charities which is really
cool it was also going to be a coupon
code down there for you guys to get 15%
off if you guys use my coupon code any
money that I would have made by you guys
buying the cell phone case I'm actually
donating it with the portion that they
donate as well at is the cell phone case
that's currently on my phone and I love
it I'm obsessed it's just so pretty it's
got like baby blue and pink and purple
and white marble and it's just
everything that is my sole coffee break
okay
so starting with the home page when you
click the little fun button on my phone
it's just a picture of the Empire State
Building I don't know why I have such an
obsession with New York City to be
honest with you guys I believe I got it
off of we heart it le I'll link to it
down below so you guys can make it your
screen savers as well if you guys would
like to so that's that when you first
open my phone let's start with the main
home page the background again is also
from wee hearted which I will
link to down below but the first thing
at the top here is my snapchat so I
believe my snapchat somewhere on the
screen right here
it's just Kalin Nicholson if you guys
are wondering I post I post a lot of
sneak peeks of videos and outfits and
stuff like that to my snapchat and
Bentley and anytime I'm doing anything
fun and then right beside my snapchat is
Twitter again I'll leave my Twitter it's
just the app handle is just Caleb
Nicholson again and then right beside
that is my We Heart It and this is
probably one of my favorite apps it's
pretty much like a photography op where
you just scroll through it's a little
bit like Tumblr but I just like the
layout of this one more and it's just a
bunch of really cool photos and stuff
and then you can make like little boards
so this is why we heart it these are all
the pictures that I've parted on my
canvas and then you make collections of
photos so I have like quotes I have
wonder lies I have adorable interior
design warm and cozy summertime makeup
and fashion and chanting health and
fitness a bunch of stuff like that
there's also a collection on there
called sweet Jesus and it's just a bunch
of hot guys I got you hooked up go check
that out a lot of you guys also asked
wearing it my quotes from and I always
get my quotes on We Heart It or on
tumblr so if you go you can actually
follow my collections of quotes on be
heart it if you guys are ever curious
because I also heard a bunch of quotes
I'm right beside we heard it is just my
emails and then on the bottom I just
have like messages Instagram so this is
my current feed on instagram we'll get
to that later in the video but he
doesn't follow me on instagram is just
Kayla Nicholson 13 it's also how do you
guys feel about the fact that Instagram
is trying to be snapchat because to be
honest with you I don't think I like it
I don't know let me know what you guys
think about it down below but I can vary
on the fence about it I think I prefer
snapchat so I'm right beside Instagram
is just Safari and the beside that is my
phone like to call people and then when
you swipe to the second I have
everything else in a folder I like to be
able to see the background on my phone
it's just kind of like a preference
thing so in the first folder at the top
here it's photography so I have my
camera app photos and then plan Ollie so
if you guys have never heard of that
before it's basically like you can plan
out your Instagram I'm a huge dork when
it comes to photography and I
like like when photos kind of all flow
together nicely so I usually take my
photos a bit in advance and then upload
them I know not everybody has the time
to do that but it's just such a dorky
hobby of mine even if I'm just taking
one and I just want to see what it looks
like on my feet before I upload it you
can do that on here hello that I have
facetune I was like everybody has space
to use facetune a lot I'll use the
whiting tool to like white and
background and then I also use like
tones where I'll paint backgrounds if I
want it to be like a certain color or
anything like that so yeah and then
beside facetune is the SEO or visco or
however you want to pronounce it this is
like my favorite favorite favorite photo
filter app so I always put all of my
photos in here and I use two different
filters the first one is e8 and the
second one is f2 and then I'll kind of
play around with like the temperature
and the color and the fate and that's
pretty much all I do to my photos and
then beside that I just have an app
called aviary and this is just really
good if you take a photo that's either
way too overexposed or way to
underexpose
the coffee break oh my god it tastes
like all in a cup so beside that I have
a folder called boss you boss like like
do work kind of thing so these are all
of my like productivity apps so this
first one right here it's called forest
and it's actually so cool guys this is
one of my favorite apps so one of my
things I'm trying to work on right now
is being more productive and not being
so like spaced down it all the time get
a garden or you get a forest or whatever
and every time that you need to make
sure that you don't like dilly dive on
your phone you start a timer so you can
do it up to two hours and then you hit
plant and then so let's say I put it on
for 25 minutes on a hit plant then it's
going to be planting a tree for 25
minutes on my phone I go on my phone and
I cancel it then the plant dies but it
still ends up in my forest so you just
see this dead tree in your forest so you
failed and if you do the whole 25
minutes then plants the tree in your
forest and then long story short you get
this like little square and you can
build a bunch of trees and stuff like
that and you build your four eyes and
besides that I have one called
productive I actually just downloaded
this
recently so I'm not too sure how I feel
about it yet but it's supposed to help
you build a habit you can do things like
go to the gym it's basically a habit
builder so it helps you create any sort
of habit that you want to do and then
you check it off every day besides that
I have my calendar than my notes and
then I have Eve this is actually a
really really really good app to have as
a girl you can track when your period
starts when it end it also has this
thing called cycle scope so based on
your cycle and where your hormones are
at it'll kind of tell you why you're
feeling a certain way that day today
it's telling me that I should have a hot
date with myself and that I'm likely to
be feeling more withdrawn than normal
due to low hormones things like that
that way I'm never like what the hell am
I supposed to get my period so that I
have my banking and then underneath that
I just have reminders then beside that
folder I have one called fun this one
has my uber my Fitbit my skype it which
is an app of that I just downloaded you
get a free 7-day trial so I figured I
tried out you play it while you run and
it's got like a personal trainer in your
ear being like run fast now run slow no
do that it's not do that so I'm going to
see if I like it to be honest I haven't
even tried it yet underneath that I have
my audible which is like my go-to app
all the time no I'm not being sponsored
by audible I literally just love
audiobooks yeah beside that I have my
Spotify if you guys don't know which I'm
sure you do if you've been following me
for a while now but I am obsessed with
music I spend a lot of time making
playlists it's something that I used to
do on eight tracks but I actually prefer
spot to find more now I have workout
playlists on here I have like more indie
pop I have more indie chill
I have acoustic stuff I have like R&amp;amp;B
and Drake and everything that I listen
to is on my Spotify side that I have my
tumblr again I'll leave a link down
below
the other place that I got all my quotes
if you are curious one of my favorite
tumblers to follow is called words and
quotes I'll leave a link to them down
below any that I have Netflix which is
really good I only ever use Netflix on
my phone when I'm at the gym beside
Netflix I have YouTube and then I have
Facebook app so then beside the fun
album I have the needs it sounds like my
music
my app store my settings weather maps
contacts my Rogers which is pretty much
just to pay my cell phone bill my
Starbucks app and then Shazam which is
like so key when you hear a song and
you're like what song is this and you
need to figure out what it is you pretty
much just play Shazam and it will tell
you what song it is then last but not
least I have an album called random this
is going to be the most boring folder on
this whole phones it's pretty much every
app that they like they put on your
phone and then make it so that you can't
friggin delete it even though you're
never going to use it is in this folder
if you use guitar tuna I'm not going to
lie guitar tuna is key basically it's an
app that Tunes your guitar for you so
you just play a chord and it Tunes it
random is just like stuff that I like
why you exist that is all the good stuff

been curious I hope you guys enjoyed
