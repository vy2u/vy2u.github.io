to do a more sit down and talk video
with you guys and it has been so highly
requested that I do more of the coffee
talk style videos that I used to do on
my second channel and I kind of stopped
doing them was planning on doing more
videos style journals and then it just
like I lost the not inspiration to do
these videos but I guess I lost the
motivation to do these videos and if
it's because I'm being 100% honest it's
that sometimes it can be really really
hard to be like this raw and vulnerable
in a video and really put your feelings
out there and upload that to the
internet for people to see and not only
just strangers to see what people you
know or people that you grew up with and
like I'm just being 100% honest with you
guys so yeah I think that's kind of why
I student make as many anymore
especially the video journals and just
stuff like that where a lot of people
were like oh like this is kind of weird
or I don't really like this and I
unfortunately focused on those comments
over the ones that from you guys that
told me that you did really like it and
you loved it and you loved that rawness
and that openness and stuff so I'm going
to start doing them again because those
are the ones that I do really feel the
most passionate about and those are the
ones that I feel like are the most real
for me so I'm just going to start doing
them because they're what I want to make
for you guys and they're the ones that
like they're the read stuff this style
sit down and talk videos are the reason
and the ones that I love to watch the
most on YouTube and it's because I love
finding other people that like just are
so open and raw with themselves and
their emotions and you can connect more
with these people and you relate more to
these people and you see like the
realness as much as I love like my cut
and dry videos I want to start doing
more of these with you guys and I hope
you're okay with that
and this is all part of just my
transition over the last I would say
four or five months of just becoming
more Who I am and I said I wanted to
start changing like the content of
videos that I put out and I have been
doing that but that included this style
of video so I want to start doing these
more so now that I'm done rambling um I
guess I just wanted to sit down and talk
to you guys because I have been doing
like really really well lately with
feeling better and for those of you that
don't know or if you're new I do
struggle from anxiety and depression
and it comes in and out of my life at
different times in different phases and
at different severa T's so I've been
doing really well lately and I've been
getting so into this like whole artistic
side I feel like I've really dug into it
and just been really like feigning like
creation if that makes any sense like
I've been loving loving photography I'm
very into photography right now and just
amongst a billion other things and I'm
writing my ebook and it's just been so
amazing for me to have this complete
different creative release and with that
it's caused a lot of self-reflection I
guess and lately I've been doing this
thing where at night I make myself a tea
and I like just sit down and I'm just
kind of with my thoughts and that sounds
funny or corny or whatever but it's true
like I'll just sit out sit and stare out
the window and just be with my thoughts
and like see how I'm feeling that day
what am I thinking that day like what
what just basically be with myself and
with my mind and a whole whack of stuff
goes on up here I promise you guys it's
crazy I think like 80% of the time my
brain is like totally on a completely
different page in a completely different
path like I'll be sitting there being
like yes uh-huh but I'm thinking about
like what is the meaning of life so
lately I've been having this
overwhelming like question and search
for Who am I being 21 I still don't have
a complete answer to that question and
I'm not sure if anyone ever really will
if you'll ever be able to be like who
are you to somebody and they can just
they just give you a definition because
I think it's it can be very limiting to
define yourself to a small box of things
or a small list of things and when
somebody asks you who you are you just
you're like a deer in the headlights
you're like uh like it's a hard question
so an even harder question is when
you're asking yourself who you are
because you're not trying to give some
elaborate explanation to make yourself
sound good you're just sitting with your
own thoughts and really asking like Who
am I like what do I believe in what do I
love doing whatever my passions what is
most important to me in life what are my
priorities and sitting with those
thoughts it can almost kind of become
overwhelming and for me myself it became
overwhelming because I started to have
this revelation that I have no idea and
in turn
I wanted to make this video to tell you
guys I have no idea because I feel like
because I put my life on the internet
and because I post fun photos and blog
posts and I post my thoughts and like a
dialogue and just a bunch of different
things and I post these videos where I'm
making like a DIY nook and all this fun
crazy stuff that you guys get this crazy
idea that I have my life together and I
see it all the time and I'll see it in
comments being like you're so totally
goals or like you are this and you're
that I feel like then you guys are
getting this perception of me that is
totally untrue or totally elaborate and
it's not actually who I am you guys only
see about not even like a quarter you
guys see just a fraction of my life
because obviously it would be way too
time-consuming to film my entire life
24/7 for you guys to watch but you want
you guys only get to see a fraction so
obviously that fraction of my life that
I'm going to put out on the Internet is
going to be the best version it's going
to be something I worked really hard on
I would never put something up for you
guys that I didn't really you know spend
a lot of time on or put my heart and
effort into because that's how much it
means to me and it is in a way my job is
a way for me to create and I love doing
that but I never want you guys to get
this idea that I am like this perfect
image or this perfect life that I like
never cry and never get upset nothing
bad ever happens to me and all of that
fun stuff because that's not just not
true it's it's not so and the thing is
is I feel like a lot of people
especially around my age or maybe even
older and especially younger I feel like
we all don't know who we are and we are
all lost at a lot of different times in
our life but we're all too afraid to
admit it or we're all too afraid to say
it because if you're lost or you're
confused well I feel like there's just
overwhelming pressure that you always
have to have your together are you
locked in you're Kendall Bentley can't
get out of his kennel because the cords
from the lighting are blocking them and
be right back so lately I have been
constantly questioning myself like Who
am I what what what makes up Who I am
what is important to me what are my
priorities what do I believe in and this
has been something that I've been kind
of struggling with over the last I would
say six months especially and I wouldn't
well maybe not struggling struggling is
probably not the best word but
coming up with just a definite answer
even just for myself because I am
somebody where I like like complete
answers I can't sit and linger in the
unknown it drives me insane it eats me
alive and so I feel like that's why I
get so easily affected when I start to
lose faith in myself and I start to lose
myself I get so torn up by it because
then I question everything about myself
and I question all the things I'm doing
all the things I'm saying all the things
I'm believing in what everybody's
thinking about me what am I putting out
to the world and I think that's because
we're so often told or there's just this
misconception that being lost and
confused is a bad thing and that you
need to figure it out right away you
need to find what's going on you need to
figure out who you are and run with it
and then be exceptional and be amazing
at just being you and I think that's
hard to be amazing at being you and you
don't know exactly who that is someone
that I tend to sit alone with my
thoughts a lot and I think that can be a
good thing but I also think it can be a
bad thing where I create these problems
that aren't really there and like like I
told you guys I begin to lose a lot of
faith and have a lot of stuff doubt and
things like that and I'm always
constantly emitting this positive like
positive attitude online I'm always
telling you guys to believe in yourself
and all of these great things and it's
because I'm trying to tell myself to do
those things too so I never want you
guys to have the misconception that I'm
constantly a positive person just like
walking around happy-go-lucky all the
time I'm not I guess in a way this video
is me to kind of explaining a little bit
more of Who I am so you guys can get a
better idea and to tell you guys that
it's okay to be lost and not know who
the hell you are because I think that
this period of your life this whole
confusion and figuring out who you are I
think that it's one of the most pivotal
moments of your life and it's also one
of the most important moments of your
life and I think the longer you stay in
this phase the better because if you too
quickly define yourself you limit
yourself to a small box of things or
you're putting limitations on walls on
growth and I think that being confused
and not knowing who you are and
constantly questioning yourself is a
good thing because that is what's going
to inspire you to learn try new things
grow figure your
oh and I don't think I ever want to stop
doing that and not only that I am a very
emotional person um and this is
something I've only recently come to
terms of because I think again when
things like social media are excelling
as much as they are now we're told that
to not care makes you cool and when you
don't care about things you brush it off
your shoulder you're like people that
don't really show you any side of their
personality it's a lot of just images
and short captions with mysterious
meanings and I think that that kind of
creates this illusion that we're
supposed to be this like mystical
mysterious person and that we don't have
a motion and that we're always just
constantly happy and perfect and all of
these things and that's where um like we
kind of lose the ability to be emotional
and I think for a long time I made me
really insecure how sensitive and
emotional that I can be and I used to
try and hide that all the time and I
become this like stone rock and I don't
let anyone into those emotions and those
sensitivities and I only kind of sit
with them in with myself and I think
that can be very detrimental because
when you lose your sensitivity and your
emotion you lose passion for things you
stop fighting for things you believe in
and you stop drew it like driving
towards what you want and what your
goals are and you stop putting meaning
into them and things don't go your way
you pretend that you don't care when
really it eats you alive inside and then
all of these emotions get pent up and I
think that's why a lot of the times a
lot of people can be so unhappy and no
one else knows and no one else sees it
because we all keep it behind this wall
and this illusion that we are like
totally happy and living the most
perfect happy lives there have been
multiple times and even recently where I
am so upset and I'm so broken and
confused and lost and like crying and I
say and I ask myself like why do I feel
this way what is causing this and I have
no idea and it can be really frustrating
to feel that way because being that I am
a very emotional person my emotions do
come to the surface quite a bit and when
they do and you have no idea why they're
there especially when it's a sad emotion
or an anxious emotion or an upset
emotion or an unfulfilled emotion and
you're asking yourself why you feel that
way and you don't even know
you start to question yourself you're
like what is wrong with me why am I so
crazy why can't my life be so put
together like it seems this person does
or why can't my life be as easy as that
person's is and we don't realize that
everybody's going through things and
everybody has emotions and a lot of the
time well 90% of the time like everybody
hides it we're trying to be deep and
philosophical can you just like wait
five minutes then we'll play with your
rudolf so i guess the big question i've
been really asking myself lately is who
am i and i apologize if this video has
just been kind of all over the place
because I had no real set direction with
this I just kind of wanted to sit and
ramble because that's what I feel like
like I'm kind of trying to figure this
out at the same time as I'm filming this
so I had no set direction with this I
have no answers I wish I did I wish I
could give you guys something but I
can't because I'm still figuring it out
for myself
and I guess what's important to me is to
get that out there that I am still
figuring out who I am I'm still learning
and growing and trying new things and
having setbacks all of the time and I
never want you guys to believe or think
that I have it all figured out or all
put together because I don't and the
best part about that is and something
that I've learned recently is that's
okay it's okay for me to not have it
figured out it's okay for me to not feel
like I'm there yet or for me to not feel
like I have this like perfect life and
it's okay for you to feel those things
too because honestly I don't know if I
want a perfect life I feel like this
whole phase of being confused and
growing and learning new things is
something that I don't really ever want
to end because when I officially define
myself or sit down and be like okay this
is what I believe in and this is what I
love mobile blah and if I were to never
challenge that I feel like that's when
you stop growing as a person and I don't
think we're ever supposed to stop
growing I think we're supposed to have
really good days and we're supposed to
have really bad days and we're supposed
to have some emotion and we're supposed
to care and I don't think there's
anything wrong with caring and I don't
think there's anything wrong with
feeling upset and lost and confused I
just feel like in this day and age we're
constantly fronted with these images
where it doesn't seem like anyone's lost
and confused it doesn't seem like
anyone's trying to figure out it feels
like everybody already has it figured
out so then we internalize all of these
things and we don't
really let them out or we don't even
talk about them or sometimes we don't
even let ourselves think about them
because we don't want to we don't want
to have to deal with it even on our own
even without other people's help I guess
what it boils down to is Who am I right
now and right now I am in love with my
dog he is like my child I live in Canada
and there's just this year I've learned
to appreciate all the seasons that come
with Canada I never used to like winter
and now I do and like excited for winter
I'm very lost and very confused and
because of that reason I like to journal
a lot and with journaling I feel like
it's a way of expressing and escaping
honestly 90% of the time when I'm out in
public or when I'm around anyone I'm
constantly thinking that they're
thinking something bad about me it just
it's just part of my anxiety and it's
still something I'm working on um I am
like deathly afraid of wasting my life
it causes me to become a little bit of a
perfectionist and when things don't go
completely perfect I get grumpy and you
can ask Ryan on that one but most of all
I have just like this overwhelming
passion and I'm loving following that
and I'm just learning more about that
and I'm growing and there's still so
much I don't know about myself and
there's still so much that I'm just
learning now and I think instead of
hating that idea or hating that process
I think I'm learned just now learning to
love it so ask yourself who are you and
just be open and real about it and don't
be afraid to not have any clue and don't
be afraid to not know whatsoever because
I'm telling you right now I have no idea
most of the people don't have any idea
even if they don't say it or it doesn't
seem like it and we're all just trying
to figure it out so regardless of who
you are regardless of if you know some
things about yourself or if you feel
completely lost we're all in this
together we're all figuring it out
together so I want to know who you guys
are I want to know what you guys would
in this right moment right now who are
you and and don't define yourself or
restrict yourself to just that but leave
a comment down below who are you right
now in this moment what are you thinking
right now in this moment what are you
feeling what are you loving what are you
hating anything like that let me know
down below exactly who you are right now
and who you want to be some days it's
one thing in some days is another but
there's definitely a few things that I
know I want to be or the type of person
that I want to be and that's just what
I'm going to keep my focus on and keep
my goal on but understand and appreciate
the obstacles along the way
I really want to start doing more of
these like real and raw videos with you
guys because I feel like that's when I
get the best my best voice out there if
that makes any sense I do love doing the
cut-and-dry videos and all of these
things that inspire me but just keep in
mind when I make videos to inspire you
guys it's because I'm trying to inspire
myself too I don't have it all put
together I don't have it all figured out
but that's the best part because I don't
think any of us do and that's what makes
it so fun to like live and share so yeah
thumbs up if you guys like this video
and I'll definitely do more if you guys
have any other topics you guys want me
to talk about in these styles of videos
just let me know down below and other
than that I hope you guys are all having
an amazing day and be kind to yourself
