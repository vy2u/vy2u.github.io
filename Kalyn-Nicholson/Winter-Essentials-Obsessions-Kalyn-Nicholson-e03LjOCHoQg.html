the same water bottle like oh this was
so cool to me you guys have no idea how
long I have been working on designing
this and to how long this has been in
the works it's been like over a year
I've been talking about doing merch so
to be able to officially do it and get
it out to you guys ridiculously excited
if you guys are following me already I'm
going to put my Twitter in my instagram
right here on the screen
you guys can come and follow me I've
officially changed my Instagram theme
for the winter time yes I am that basic
but definitely be sure to check it out
and if you guys want and updated like
how to phim your Instagram for the
winter time then just thumbs this video
out so funny enough this year christmas
came a little bit early for little guy
it gets so cold up here in canada during
the winter time but lee is such a small
dog that you get super cold and stuff
especially coming back indoors from
going outside to go to the washroom or
from walks and stuff like that on him
heated blanket i actually picked this up
off amazon if I can find the link I'll
leave it down below but it's just this
like gray heated blanket and it's got
this really soft like white material on
the inside so you plug it into the wall
it's it's safe you can put it on warm
low medium or
and I usually have this on my bed and I
keep it on throughout the day that one
Bentley comes in from outside you can
just
he literally runs to it and like
nosedives underneath it because it gets
so warm especially like last Sunday when
it was snowing here Bentley and I just
like cuddled up under this heated
blanket and watched Netflix all day and
it was so comfy and cozy so that is
definitely one of my favorite essentials
for the winter time and I'm sure you
guys won't be surprised about this one
considering it's kind of like a
year-round essential for me but my
second essential is slippers so these
ones are kind of like little ugh bootie
slippers and then my other favorites are
these ones here that I bought last year
you guys probably already seen these
before too so I actually picked these up
last year from Victoria Secret these are
super easy to just like throw on or
slide on my feet from going to the
garbage room or if I'm going to do like
laundry or something then lately because
it's been so much chillier and colder
I've been wearing these ones I recently
picked these up from our Dean which is a
store in Canada um but yeah they're just
like these great little like furry
booties so my favorite handle for the
wintertime is the mahogany balsam from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I actually discovered
this last year and it smells so good how
many teak wood again very basic of me is
actually my favorite candle from Bath
and Body Works so when I saw that they
came out with him the hogging ball zone
or I don't even know if I'm saying that
right balls Sam balls um like it smells
like Christmas tree mixed with hot boy
it's everything if you guys haven't
gotten this one yet I seriously
recommend go pick this up it is like my
absolute favorite this is already my
second one that I bought this year
because I've already burned through my
first one that's I'm obsessed with this
candle I am and then in terms of drinks
obviously I'm obsessed with coffee but
lately I've gotten back into drinking
peppermint tea I've been craving
peppermint all the time lately and I'm
trying to cut back on my caffeine
consumption so I figured I would go back
to drinking peppermint teas again and
also super good for those of you guys
that might get like upset stomachs or
like indigestion or anything like that
peppermint tea is really really good for
settling your stomach and helping like a
digestion it's way better than putting
like sugary syrups and stuff in your
coffee and speaking of warm beverages my
favourite mug for the wintertime or at
least this winter I just recently picked
up this better latte than ever I got it
from chapter slash
to go for those of you guys that live in
Canada it's been at my all-time favorite
mug which usually changes once a month
now getting into some of my favorite
beauty items for the wintertime just in
general a recent uh I always pick up the
like travel size of perfumes because I
lose perfume all the friggin time the
most recent one I picked up when I was
in LA is oh so sexy and it has been like
my favorite perfume right now and I find
it's a little bit more like I don't know
it's got a little bit more spice in it
for like this time of year another
essential of mine for the winter time is
body butter this is something I tend to
switch to when the air starts getting
really cold and crisp because my skin
gets so dry no there's something so nice
about like getting out of a hot shower
putting this on and then climbing into
bed even though I know hot water dries
out your skin even more I can't give up
my hot showers thicker than like a body
lotion is going to like lock in the
moisture if you put it on right after
your shower my favorite nail polish has
been the Essie cocktail bling which was
also a winter essential of mine from
last year I don't know I just like like
the icy gray that this gives I'll do a
kind of weight clip here so you guys can
see what this looks like on but it's
just been my favorite color for last
winter and it just it's one of those
things that I didn't give up this year
it's it's making a comeback a different
winter jackets I recently picked is this
jacket up from Charlotte Russe and it
has been my go-to in terms of it getting
cold and now snowy here I'm definitely
gonna have to pick up another winter
jacket for when it starts to heavily
snow perfect for those of you guys that
might be a little bit for their self
that don't get as heavy as a winter and
I just love the length and the fit of
this so this has definitely been a
winter obsession for me and of course in
terms of accessories I'm still obsessed
with the size if you guys remember this
hat from last year comment down below if
you everything ever about winter is
being able to wear like beanies and
toups again we call them tubes here so
this is like my favorite hat from last
year and it's got like the cute little
pom-pom on it other winter essential for
me is making some sort of cozy nook or
area in my apartment to kind of go to in
the winter time because obviously when
it starts to snow and get colder outside
I like to spend way more time inside I
mean who doesn't is creating some sort
of cozier atmosphere you can do this
with blankets you can do this with
pillows lighting you can get cushions
and put them on the
and I actually did a video last year
where it was like how to make yourself
like a reading nook so I'll link that
somewhere on the screen if you guys
haven't seen that but I even do this
just on my couch behind me where the
blanket is that's like my favorite place
to sit and like read or hang out on my
laptop or watch TV and then that kind of
leads into my next essential which is
cozier lighting I don't know if it's
just because it gets cold outside or if
softer lighting is just cozier in the
winter or if it's because Christmas is
around the corner but stringing up
lights all around my apartment I just
tend to do it so much more in the winter
it's such a big essential for me I find
it just makes indoors a little bit less
like depressing during the winter so
getting any sort of string lights which
now's the perfect time to do it
considering it is getting into Christmas
time adding cozy or lighting to your
atmosphere in your bedroom your
apartment your dorm wherever you are it
just it's so much cozier and just so
much warmer anywhere there's the ability
to string up lights I'll do it and of
course what would an obsessions slash
essentials video be if I didn't tell you
guys
then another huge essential for me is
having a go to playlist for the winter
because of course I'm like that dad from
scream queens that like has a playlist
for everything I'll leave a link down
below of my snowed in playlist um it's
basically just a bunch of like you know
smooth listening like John Mayer and all
that music that you can listen to during
the winter time whether it's like
Blizzard I know or it's just super cold
and you're spending a Sunday afternoon
indoors that is kind of like the go-to
music I listen to during this time of
year that concludes my winter obsessions
be sure to leave me a comment down below
telling me some of the obsessions or
essentials you guys have for the
wintertime
and other than that I hope you guys
enjoyed and I'll see you guys all in my
next video bye guys
