my channel for today's video I'm doing a
fitness Friday with you guys and I'm
doing it the much-anticipated
updated when is what winter fitness
routine with you guys since it has been
so highly requested and I've also really
kind of stuck to a new fitness routine
recently and it's been really really
working out for me so I figured I would
share it with you guys as always if you
guys aren't following me already I'm
going to pop my Twitter and my Instagram
right here on the screen and other than
that if you guys want to know my winter
fitness routine then just keep watching
you know it's just like way too hot in
here for slippers right now so this is
just eight so I figure the easiest way
to kind of share with you guys what my
fitness routine is is to go through what
I do every single day of the week since
everything is pretty heavily scheduled
based on what day of the week it is and
what it is I'm doing those days so
Sunday is the biggest meal prep that I
do so I tend to meal prep two days a
week Sunday being the first one and I
will meal prep for Monday Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday so I'll make four
breakfasts form lunches four dinners and
technically eight snacks because I have
a morning snack and then I have an
afternoon snack I've been talking about
this with you guys in my vlogs already
and I've done meal prep videos before
which I'll pop up on the screen if you
guys haven't seen those I have a
Pinterest board that is just of my vegan
meals and anytime I tend to do any sort
of meal prepping I like to look up new
meals and stuff on Pinterest just to
keep things fresh and so I don't get too
bored of all the food that I'm eating so
I'll link that down below as well but be
sure to come check out that Pinterest
board because it has multitudes of food
that I've been eating so if you guys are
following along with my vlogs you guys
probably already know this but the
circuit training that I follow is the
Kayla it signs at signs I always always
butcher her last name
BBG or like bikini body guide that is
the circuit training that I follow so
each week there's a different workout
for Monday and Wednesday and then Friday
is like an optional body workout Monday
is usually a legs and butt day and if I
don't follow the BBG workout I just do
my own kind of circuits the basic
rundown of it is to do four different
workouts two times each so you go
through one circuit you do four workouts
and then you go through another circuit
do four different workouts then you go
back to the first one do those four
again this one do those four again and
then that's it for your workout so in
total you're doing eight different
workouts two times does that make sense
so with Monday being legs and butt it's
usually a lot of squatting a lot of
lunges I have like a medicine ball and
some free weights at home that I'll use
but it usually takes me about 30 minutes
to do and I can do it from home I can do
it when I'm traveling it's super easy
as for Tuesday Tuesday is a cardio day
for me so Tuesday I like to go to the
gym I usually go to the gym at nighttime
I'm not much of a morning gym girl it's
just not my thing also just because I
have the world's thickest hair so if I
showered in the morning there's just no
way I'd get anything done on Tuesdays
Tuesday I will go to the gym I try and
do a 5k although I'm still building back
up to my runs because I did damage my
knee pretty badly in the summertime
Wednesdays are back to an at-home
circuit train so Wednesdays usually are
my favorite because they are abs and
arms now I'm not a huge fan of the arm
workout but I do love doing my ab
workouts they're like my favorite
favorite favorite ones eight different
workouts two times or two different
circuits does that make sense
I'm really really hoping that makes
sense but yeah I'll do a lot of sit-ups
it's a lot of crunches it's a lot of leg
lifts push-ups burpees things like that
jumping rope little tiny things just as
like little circuits that you can do
Thursday of course is back to another
cardio day so these days I like to take
the cardio a little bit slower so I'm
Thursdays I like to do the stair climber
I'll go and usually do 30 to 45 minutes
depending on how much energy I have that
day but another really important thing
about Thursday is that this is also the
second day of meal prep for me so I'll
meal prep on Thursdays for Friday
Saturday and Sunday and since it is a
shorter meal prep and B it's like my
weekend meal prep I usually get a little
bit more fun with my Thursday meal
perhaps I'm such a dork at least one
meal either it be lunch or dinner or
sometimes even breakfast you know maybe
I've filmed pancakes and I'll find like
a healthier alternative to some of my
favorite meal so whether it be you know
making some sort of like vegan burger
for dinner for the meal prep or like I
said waffles pancakes burritos whatever
it is meal prep something that's kind of
more of like a favorite of mine so I
don't get too bored with like eating
healthy foods all the time that
concludes Thursday Friday is the
optional on the BVG guidelines but I
always do it it is a full body workout
so it tends to be a lot of arms arms abs
butt legs and a tiny bit of cardio as
well it's the exact same thing two
different circuits two times or eight
different workouts two times but you
always end up feeling it the next day
let me tell you that much
and that leads me into Saturday Saturday
is like an optional cardio day if I
happened to miss any of the workouts
throughout the week I will do the
optional Saturday cardio and I'll go to
the gym and either do the stair climber
elliptical treadmill whatever I'm
feeling that day but Saturday isn't like
scheduled in as a workout day so that
way I can at least have two days of rest
if I need it
aka Saturday and Sunday which means we
have just looped through the whole week
so that is like a general rundown of
what my recent fitness routine has been
a few different things to keep in mind
one I do not weigh myself anymore this
is such like I can't even explain to you
guys what not weighing myself has done
to a my self-esteem
and be also just the fact that like I
feel so much better not you know going
based off of the amount of weight that I
am one thing I have noticed especially
since I have been really consistent with
this workout plan that I've been telling
you guys about for the last however many
minutes now I've been sticking very very
strictly to this aside from what I have
the flu and I have actually started to
see results muscle weighs more than fat
so I knew that with gaining muscle my
weight probably was either gonna stay
the same if not increase but my body was
still gonna be changing I highly
recommend maybe it's not for everybody
but I I just stopped weighing myself it
made my life so much easier
another big thing that I've been trying
to do is to drink more water so I try
and drink about two to three of my water
bottles a day now that is not even
enough I'm trying to just slowly
increase because I find water is one of
those habits that is so hard for me to
just like jump right back into which is
funny because we're talking about water
drinking water has helped so much with
my bloating I'm somebody that bloats so
easy you guys have no idea so yeah I'm
down to one coffee and I've also been
drinking a crap ton of tea always been a
cardio bunny but I was never really sure
what to do when it came to strength
training or circuit training and and
seeing the results in my body and seeing
in the results and the way I feel is
like one of the most addicting things in
the world I'm not saying that maybe my
fitness routine will work for all of you
guys I'm just saying find something that
works for you and stay consistent
because trust me when you start to see
the results
it is so addicting so that concludes my
winter fitness routine let me know down
below what your guys's fitness routine
is if you guys have one or if you guys
decide to try mine out let me know if
you like it and other than that I will
see you guys all in tomorrow's twelve
days of Christmas all right I'm going to
stop boring you guys No bye
I wanted to do a coffee talk with the
guys since it's been a while since I
fell in love or today's coffee talk I
want to talk about something
but I know somebody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
