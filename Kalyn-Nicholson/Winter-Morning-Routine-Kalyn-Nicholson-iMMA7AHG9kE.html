what's up guys and welcome back to my
channel for today's video I'm going to
be doing a holiday inspired or holiday
infused morning routine as you could say
it's a winter morning routine but it's
very festive even if somebody for the
fact that this video marks the first in
the 12 days of camus series that is
right for the next 12 days we will be
counting down until Christmas with a new
video every single day with this video
being the first one if you can't tell
I'm a little sick right now so I
apologize in advance for the frog enos
and my bro know flu is gonna keep me
from the festivities that are gonna
happen over the next 12 days 12 days of
cameras are pretty much already done by
now but I'm gonna be hinting at videos
and things like that on both my Twitter
and my Instagram so definitely be sure
to follow me and check it out New Year's
Eve videos coming some coffee talk some
inspo some holiday stuff it's gonna be
wicked but getting back to today's video
if you guys want to see my holiday
inspired morning routine then just keep
watching
baby
baby hurry down the chimney tonight
so baby the outer space convertible
and hurry down the chimney tonight so
lately I've been making it a goal of
mine to make my bed first thing in the
morning just so that you know my room
just always just seems so much cleaner
and then I'll open up my blinds and it
just kind of like gives me this little
pep in my step to start the day with and
I'll also change into my workout gear
first thing in the morning feed Bentley
and this morning that I was filming I
actually filled my morning routines like
as I'm going through my morning if you
guys are curious but that morning I'd
been up at like 4:00 to let Bentley out
so I didn't have to let him out right
away so instead I decided to make a
coffee and go through my day planner
first and let Bentley eat his breakfast
before taking him
and if you've been watching my vlogs
lately you'll know that I'm also
recently very obsessive for eating my
horoscope in the morning it's so nerdy
but I I kind of just I feel like it's a
nice little bit of inspiration to start
your day with and most of the time
they're pretty positive and then I also
make it a huge thing to walk Bentley
every morning it's just like again it's
just one of those little like
therapeutic things to start my day with
I'll throw my headphones in and we'll
just walk around until you know he's
done this business
and starting in November I made a new
like challenge of mine to always take
the stairs since I'm only on like the
sixth floor of my building so taking the
stairs is totally feasible and then once
back inside I'll always give Bentley a
treatment work on his tricks his newest
trick lately is playing dead as usual
witness right here see you can teach an
old dog new tricks
you ain't the Mansell you in it I found
myself just going back to standard
running as my work out I'll sometimes
switch up a little bit of strength
training but I think lately for me
running has just been such like a
therapeutic thing and it really helps
with my anxiety so the last bit I've
just been super obsessed with running
and I'll run about five to eight
kilometres depending on the day and then
I usually run Monday to Friday and take
a break on the weekends and then once
back inside I'll kick my shoes back off
and take a super hot shower this is
literally my favorite part of the day
solely for the fact that I get to blare
tunes
I've had people knock and like pound on
the roof and all my walls more than once
because I think will blow the music's so
loud and light candles and basically
just do all the beauty stuff like
putting on my lotion putting on Vaseline
on my lips I will brush my teeth and do
my hair just all of that like girly
stuff
oh so I get questions from you guys a
lot about how I've grown out my hair and
like keep it soft and kind of somewhat
healthy and I swear to God totally
unspun sir the it's a ten leavin stuff
is my go-to I just bought the biggest
bottle of it ever and it's cruelty free
such as a bonus but and then after that
I will just like get ready to my makeup
and basically put together and look for
the date depending on whether I'm
filming going out doing coast off like
just basically pretend depending on the
day geez I cannot watch today voiceovers
gave me
I've been spending enough time couple
lemon balm aside I'll go to Santa Norma
mine and of course the most epic moment
of the morning is making breakfast I
always eat breakfast after I run don't
ask me why I just find eating before
kind of gives me upside stomach so I
will eat after and today I was having
oatmeal two of the chocolate chip
cookies I posted the recipe to my blog
but I perfected chewy chocolate chip
cookies so I've been eating those with
my coffee every morning and it's
absolutely amazing and basically just
eat my breakfast and creep on my phone I
mean I live alone so I'm definitely one
of those people that says on their phone
while I eat it's torte total terrible
habit but it's once that's done I'll
literally had to work so that is it for
my holiday inspired or winter morning
routine I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you guys all in my next video bye
guys
fading out again a few chemicals burn
buster so tell me let it kick fit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
