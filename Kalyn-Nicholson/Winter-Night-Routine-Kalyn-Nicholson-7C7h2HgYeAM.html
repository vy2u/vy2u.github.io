my channel for today's video YouTube /me
is bringing to thee a night routine
except this time I'm gonna be doing it
vlog style since I did the morning
routine old-fashioned like cut and dry
style I wanted to do this version more
vlog style to make it more hashtag I was
not a hashtag that was a piece hashtag
relatable because of the 12 days of
Camus I haven't been doing as much as
usual meaning my night routines have
been very chill and kind of like
prepping for the following day it is
currently 6:00 p.m. I just finished up
editing for the day so I'm technically
done work there is a bit of work I'm
gonna do later on my blog but as to
right now I'm going to run to the
grocery store I am in desperate need of
groceries I'm gonna run over to the
grocery store I made a grocery list on
my phone one of the things I love about
like the notes on iPhone is you can make
grocery lists with like little holes
that like you you can check them off
like when you got something like I
already picked up coffee because this
morning I couldn't wait to get groceries
before I had coffee so I wouldn't grab
coffee so I can check it off on my phone
so I have like my whole list of food and
non-food related items that I need to go
to the grocery store for and my limit at
the bottom and things that are on sale
because I googled it like I've really
been sticking to my budget lately I've
been super frugal so I'm hoping that I
can stay within I'm hoping to spend
about $60 on groceries for the week and
that includes stuff that I'm gonna use
to bake gingerbread cookies cuz I'm in
the mood to bake gingerbread cookies
tonight and I was gonna do it last week
and I ran out of time we also have
somebody else here with us hello monkey
I also need to go pick up dog food
tonight too so that'll be the other
thing hey you're tired so with that said
let's bundle up and go get groceries and
begin the night routine I'm so glad you
guys are hanging out with me tonight
it's getting a little stir-crazy today
because I've been literally editing for
hours so I'm happy
here
don't forget your reusable bag even the
environment one bag at a time
it's almost too perfect
why
right
groceries are done dinner has been made
my place has been clean then just did
some laundry and now I'm going to take
off my makeup and probably put on a face
mask I've been wearing this makeup all
day once I take it off we're gonna make
gingerbread men
so that's currently in planning I'm
hoping that you understand you ain't the
man at sell you into man
just pray to God keep you in the plan
you wait the manna tell you when it's
ugly
I've been on a mission since the day so
it's just a quick five minute hydration
mask so I'm gonna throw on a five minute
timer
I don't know where to go
so what you're trying to do Aseel common
for squatting by you by the lows just
realizing why you coming for him if
there's enough for all of us and
everybody could win but you keep
spending all the energy on things that
don't apply T I keep doing things that
you would more than probably you gotta
do I keep doing things that teachers
told you not to try and school and you
keep saying that it's going with someone
my saliva
I'm hoping that you understand you ain't
the man to tell you in the man
pray to God would keep you in the plans
you wait the man tell you in it ain't no
come on aside by stocking me watch our
money multiply
no one's stopping me you're making all
this come alive
you've gotta call me and show up but now
to come in and show up and we let along
and be a part of seats nothing so I you
never get to doll up and tell you when
to man you Justin Noah and why they stay
and they lame they always saying you've
changed but I ain't working this are
just staying the same still gingerbread
cookies are so good so actually just
finished writing up next week's blog
post I've been posting a lot more to my
blog lately if you guys didn't know that
every single Monday posts have been
going live so I just wrote next Monday's
we're just gonna be Christmas Day
basically all about like 17 things at
2017 that taught me you could be a
little bit longer the right then I
thought it was going to but I think I
got them all letting yourself figure it
out finding the beauty in the madness
you've got to be sure of yourself give
it 24 hours stop fighting yourself
things like that and then I kind of go
into depth of how I learned it or kind
of like my thoughts on it from 2017 so
with that side I'm gonna finish up this
cookie Bentley I had a point 'men today
so he's super lethargic and tired I
might try and see if he'll walk with me
but if not I'm gonna pop them out on the
back deck so you go to the bathroom
brush my teeth and then cozy on up into
bed because tomorrow is another super
busy day I'm so excited to eat one of
these tomorrow my coffee in the morning
the roll
so I'm officially all cuddle up into bed
I just did at my meditation for the
night because I didn't get to do it
today today was a crazy day so I just
read it now and it's all about fear and
attachment which I feel like it's kind
of a cool way to end this blog our fear
of losing things in life causes us to
create unhealthy attachments to them and
how we are far greater than anything
that we cling to whether it be an object
or an idea kind of goes into detail how
things are always changing and our fear
of change is what causes us to latch on
to things so whether it's you know
getting gray hairs as we can older or
the places we call home the faces that
come in and out of our lives like
everything is constantly changing and
when we let the fear of that change stop
us from living that's when we start to
attach to things and we tell ourselves
that without these things we can't be
ourselves I think that that's what we
know and we don't like the unknown so I
kind of I like today's meditation
today's meditations a good one and aside
from that I hope you guys enjoyed my
vlog style night routine if you guys
liked this style of a night routine
thumbs up and let me know down below if
you want me to do both would you prefer
one of the other I just thought it was
cool because now your morning routines
are always a little funny in the sense
that while you're filming them they are
your routine but every single night
isn't exactly the same just like every
single morning isn't exactly the same
because that would be causing an
unhealthy attachment full-circle and
other than that my heated blanket is
finally warmed up Bentley is now
officially into the covers and I never
sleep cuz I'm actually really tired
ended up staying at plum midnight not
very cool of me bye guys and don't think
it to wash out lead scene
can't believe we're sitting talking to
son</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
