goodnight push back all our problems

missed seeing this in the background of
videos hey guys what's up and welcome
back to my channel for today's video it
is the third day of Christmas and I'm
going to be sharing with you guys seven
different outfits of the week for winter
I felt like I couldn't do the twelve
days of camus without throwing in an
outfit video so with that I decided to
pull together seven different outfits
that work for the winter time and this
is coming from a Canadian okay I get
comments on these videos all the time of
people being like you must be freezing
and obviously I put a coat on top of
these outfits if I'm going to be
venturing outside but a lot of the times
these are outfits that you're really
only going to be outside when you're
going from point A to point B if you
guys won't like outside outside outfits
like if you're going skating if you're
doing things like that then I can do
that like a more covered up or like
warmer winter outfits but these are more
so just winter inspired outfits for
those of us that stay inside watch
Netflix but still want to be cozied up
in comfy sweaters really quick if you
guys aren't following me already I've
been posting so much to my Twitter and
my Instagram for the 12 days of camus
but you're also going to be getting a
lot of updates on stuff that's gonna be
happening in January that's really fun
so definitely come follow if you guys
haven't already and aside from that if
you guys want to see if my seven winter
outfits of the week then just keep
watching
street lights in your face enough

friends
