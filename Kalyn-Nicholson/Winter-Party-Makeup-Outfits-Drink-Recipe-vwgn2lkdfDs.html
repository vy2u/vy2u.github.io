again
hey guys so for today's video I decided
that you know I've been spending a
little bit too much time in my bedroom I
have no social life based on the fact
that I just I love my job so much it
just so happens that I like to consume
almost every moment doing something
work-related whether it be writing in my
book or thinking of video ideas or
coming up with like photography you're
cool whatever is obsessed with just like
being cozy and just getting so
overwhelmed with all the things that I
have to do every day that I kind of kind
of forgot to you know I have a social
life recently so it led me to the idea
that I feel like I want to go out this
weekend I think I think I might go out
for a night on the town and rally up
some people and just just go out and
have a fun night so being that I'm
planning on doing that I was like wow
I'm gonna play around with some makeup
and come up with like a fun like look to
do for the weekend and then it just
everything kind of pieced together and I
decided to make this video so for those
of you guys who are like me and want to
do something other than this on Friday
night love me
I am bored
yes I'll go on the computer getting my
clean
- Murray - Murray Chim Chim cheroo
look at this
then this video is what are you perfect
for you so this will work whether your
Christmas party is coming whether you
just want to go out or whether you are
just wanting to doll up for yourself and
have a nice champagne toast with your
dog it'll it'll work for all of those
occasions also might I throw in that I'm
doing vlogmas
which starts in five days I'm going to
be doing daily vlogs all the time of my
life
and just me and my dog and my boyfriend
so if you guys want to see my Gailey
vlogmas vlogs subscribe to my vlog
channel because there's gonna be so many
videos on that channel and i'm also
doing like so many videos on this
channel so it's not just going to be on
wednesday for the christmas season i'm
going to be throwing up a lot of extra
fun videos on this channel too but there
will be one daily on the vlogs
so I'll leave my vlog channel down below
so I'm sure you guys are sick of
listening to me ramble so with that said
keep watching to find out how to do this
winter makeup look outfit inspo and a
recipe for a fun and yummy alcohol
beverage that said drink responsibly
okay keep your pants on I mean unless
you want to take your pants off because
by all means take them off go run it
know pants are the best pants
so to start out I am just going in with
my Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
now this is cruelty free and the entire
makeup look is actually cruelty free as
well but I will leave some drugstore
cruelty free alternatives to be
higher-end things that I'm using and
then I'm just going in and stippling a
NYX concealer over my eyes and using it
as a highlight on the bridge of my nose
and my chin and my forehead and this for
eyeshadow I am going in with this Too
Faced palette and I'm using cashmere
teddy which is pretty much just a matte
topee brown color and blending that in
and then using sex spresso on the outer
corner and that is just like a more
matte chocolate brown and then bringing
this on my lower lash line as well and
then I'm just taking honeypot and using
that on the middle of my eyelid and then
I'm just using the lighter whiter matte
color as a highlight and then after
setting everything in place I'm going in
with my Kat Von D tattoo brow pencil and
again I will leave like drugstore or
cheaper products down below for all of
these things but this has been like a
new addition to my brows that I have
been doing and I absolutely love this
product
get down I'm then going in with a liquid
eyeliner and creating a pretty thick
wing which is something I haven't worn
in it's like I can't even imagine the
last time I wore liquid eyeliner but I
do like wearing it for the winter
because it's more of a dramatic look and
I just find the colder seasons call for
eyeliner I don't know why but yeah so
I'm just going in and doing a pretty
thick wing or cat eye and then I'm just
using my better than sex mascara by Too
Faced but again I will leave a cheaper
alternative down below as well but this
is a cruelty free product and I love
this mascara and then as for blush I'm
going in with this NYX berry color
because it's going to match the berry
that I'm going to be putting on my lips
and then I'm just taking a matte bronzer
to contour my cheekbones and my hairline
and my nose and my jawline as well and
then I'm just going back in with that
big fluffy pink brush to make sure that
everything is more seamless and not too
harsh or anything and then I'm just
taking a berry or burgundy colored lip
liner now this part is optional you can
skip right to the lipstick but I decided
to do this underneath just to make sure
that it lasted longer especially if
you're out partying on the town and then
I'm going in with my new Too Faced
melted liquid lipstick this thing is
amazing I'm in love with this and I got
the color mixed berry so I thought it
was like a perfect like smells like a
burgundy purpley color for the winter
time or for the Christmas time and I
thought this would look really really
good with a kabocha new skirt or an
evergreen skirt so that is the full
makeup look now as for the drink this is
super easy it's just a cranberry mimosa
and all I'm doing is adding cranberry
juice orange juice and a little bit of
champagne and you can make a huge batch
of this and add a bunch of like frozen
cranberries and strawberries and oranges
and you can make it really fun and
festive but that is the super-easy
mimosa recipe that is really yummy in
the winter time and then as for outfits
my go-to going out outfit is usually
like a skater skirt some heels and some
sort of black top now I will leave exact
links or details to this outfit in the
description box but yes this is pretty
much my two outfit in suppose for the
wintertime so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will see you guys all
in my next one bye guys
what do you mean
when in Raja head yes but you wanna say
no what do you mean</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
