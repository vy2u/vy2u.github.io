you
so basically outside my door right now
is this wreath that I made anody i why i
would show you guys this room but it's
honestly such a mess like actually the
messiest thing ever so i'm just gonna
show you my room so when you first walk
in
so behind this door here I'll show you
guys some of the shelves it's like super
messy right now so yeah these shelves
I'm not like a hundred percent proud of
they are like totally unorganized at the
moment and we're moving out in a few
months anyway so I don't know if I'll
actually ever really fully organize
these if I'm totally being honest up
there are just some plant pots I got
some books on this level and like a fake
practice and an elephant and such and
some candles and then in there are just
like some like arts and crafts stuff
might Tanner and like more candles and
then fake leaves or fake flowers sorry
and books and journals and a bunch of
like craft supplies spray paints Lysol
wipes things like that it's actually
such a mess on that side but the door is
like always covering it so I never see
it over here we have the window
so just on like the window base I have
just a bunch of my bath and Bodyworks
candles we also have like a really old
heating system and it gets so friggin
hot in here so I always leave the window
open even though hobos are always like
in our back area and suchlike they're
always like sneaking into this door here
it kind of creeps me out but Ryan's
usually here so I'll leave this one to
open because it gets way too hot in here
then here I have a dog bed for Bentley
and a little water bowl and then his
little igloo and this igloo I got from
home since he absolutely loves it I like
it better than a kennel because you can
go and hang out in there without having
to like shut the cage or anything so
it's a cool little igloo and the awesome
part about it is you can push it down
into a dog bed but I keep it up in an
igloo because that's how Bentley likes
to hang out in here and then here
Bentley has just like a box I think it's
a good forever 21 shoebox but I have all
of his toys and stuff in there then he
always reaches 4 and then over here we
just have my other set of shelves and
I'm actually a lot more proud of so on
this shelf I just have this little like
terrarium thing from I believe it was
from Urban Outfitters and I just put
string lights inside that is the tis the
season candle I have this log candle
holder thing from home scents and then
this bird from Target so that is the
first shelf so then this shelf I have
like my Pandora this has the Pandora
bracelet like actually inside and like
the charms that I got from Ryan and from
Maggie and stuff but I have to get my
Pandora fitted and here I just have like
a bunch of electronics and stuff and
then I have a strawberry shortcake
candle and a Paris candle so that is
what's on that shelf on this shelf I
just have a digital picture frame I'm
not really using right now a vanilla
snowflake candle a big white target
candle this horse head is from Walmart
and then back there is an old photo
booth photo of my Nana Peppa when they
were really young I think they were like
16 and yeah it's just like a really cute
black-and-white photo of them and then
this shelf has like a bunch of candles
and Eiffel Tower a little elephant that
I got into mannequin that's supposed to
bring your house good luck a birdcage
candle oh there and the picture frame
that I have yet to put a picture of
Bentley in if you watched my last room
tour you'll remember it but
I am planning on doing it soon I just
haven't gotten around to it yet then
moving away from that shelf this is like
the big wall behind my bed
it had like three white panels so what I
decided to do was put curtains up
instead of painting so that's like a
really easy and affordable way to like
add some texture or some color to your
walls if you guys don't want to paint or
if like you're in a dorm or something go
pick up some like ceiling-to-floor
curtains and hang them up with like
tacks or whatever and it's super easy so
I got those at risk and they're just
like gray with white little designs on
them and then here I have my nightstand
on this nightstand I just have like a
couple little things I have the kiss me
goodnight from the market which I bought
in the summertime a mahogany teak wood
candle a little deer head Bruce the
furthest brew sofa that's still growing
and this little lamp here that I got
from Target and then in this drawer I
you just usually keep like my journal my
iPad some remotes hand creams lap
chapstick and a walkie talkie as for my
bed I get a lot of questions about where
my bed is from it is from yes it's just
like a white queen bed and then it has
these drawers underneath which have like
my summer clothes and stuff inside and
like some more seasonal things and as
for pillows the two big gray pillows in
the back are from home scents and then
my bedding is from Target the red plaid
pillow is from indigo the
black-and-white one is from yes and then
the take life one cup at a time I
actually got that from my friends cedar
Marley gave that to me I was doing
Cedars makeup for her prom so that was
like the little gift she gave me which
was really nice and then this is my
bedding and then I have this a pink
Victoria's Secret blanket here and then
just like a furry really cozy soft one
from indigo throw me
to think about the consequences throw me
in the dirt don't think about the choice
this is a little breakfast nook that I
have or a breakfast table breakfast nook
what am I saying breakfast table I use
this like all the time so I pulled it
out because I usually do use it for
writing in my journal and stuff at night
and having tea but yes I get questions
about it all the time and it's from
Target and then that mug there is from
chapters and then I have my journal and
my phone case and then these little Bob
lights here are from Walmart and I just
tied some ribbon to them and as for this
little canvas here I made that in a DIY
I can link that down below and then I
just have this little shelf up here I
got that from Walmart and it was like
$20 to put the Shelf up it was really
really easy so on the Shelf I just have
this little Q a five year from chapters
a mug with some red poinsettias for the
holidays a twisted peppermint candle and
then two silver candle holders with no
candles but I just thought they were
really pretty and then of course we have
that my other nightstand and this one is
from Ikea and on top I just have this
little light-up tree and it's in like a
little burlap sack or whatever from home
since I think it's so cute a little like
fake terrarium sight plants I guess you
could say I don't really know how to
explain those but that was from Walmart
and then my laptop and then another
candle from Bath and Body Works with a
candle holder and then behind my door I
just like leave all my slippers
including the ones that I'm wearing
right now but I'm wearing them so
they're not back there and then here I
just have my door on my door I hang my
robes one of them is from loose ends of
the other ones from Victoria's Secret
and then I have just like two purses
hanging there and then I'll give you
guys just like a little peek inside my
closet I don't really have it really
well organized right now but there are
like drawers in here over here is just
like sweaters and stuff like that this
is more dresses and and then like
cardigans and plaid shirts and then
those are more summery style dresses but
I haven't just really swapped them out
yet but yeah so those are just like the
three hanging things I have and then I
put up wire lighting all throughout this
closet which was really cool it was like
the longest wire light I have ever seen
so I have it strung like everywhere and
then yeah and then in there is like my
filming room what
I can show you guys another time and
then right here just before you leave
the closet there's like this shelf so I
just filled it with shoes which I have
way too many shoes it's ridiculous but
that is the shelf oh yeah and then
there's this back of this door to with
like my yoga mat and like sweater and
purses and things like that so back out
into my room so when you come into my
closet here I just have my full-length
mirror the mirror I got from yes yeah it
was yes so and then at the bottom this
is actually where I do my makeup I've
been clearing out a whole whack of my
makeup and making my makeup more cruelty
free so I really like minimized my like
this stuff I actually use on a
day-to-day to that area and then I have
some extras in my office but I really
want to minimize like my makeup and just
kind of get like Oh more so just like
the things that I like and need and not
be like so greedy with you my makeup
that I have because I really don't even
use it that much and then that is the
like reflection because the reflection
is cool and then above there I have
three clocks everybody always asked me
why I have three clocks I haven't put
batteries in the map but I was planning
on putting them in three different
places across the world and just having
like the three different times and then
I was going to put labels underneath and
I'll probably do that when we move into
our house too but for now that's just
what it looks like and then there's my
slippers and then over here I just have
this vase from Target a lot of this
stuff was in my old room tour but then I
just have like a poinsettia and two
white roses and then here I just have my
fireplace I also get so many questions
about this so my fireplace is from rona
and I think it was like $400 we got it
last year when we lived in our old
apartment so I absolutely love this
thing so on top I just have these jars
that I made with a little faux deer and
then my television in my coaching box
so down there I just have this little
calendar that has like all my videos and
Ryan and I can look over it and see what
we have to do that day and then we are
at my desk my little mini office area I
ended up moving this into my room
because I just I don't know it felt like
I felt so secluded in my other office
working in there so I like having my
desk in here to work on like in my
bedroom itself and stuff so anyway up
here I just did this like montage of
photos and I swapped them out for the
Christmas - a little moose head guy he
is from HomeSense and then a bunch of
the pictures are from the internet and
then I just have my desktop computer I
have a little bit of white roses there a
crystal and this crystal here it's
actually really cool so it's actually a
crystal from the Himalayan mountains and
it's supposed to help like purify your
air and just like hope you concentrated
and send out like really cool good vibes
and stuff like that I like truly believe
in that kind of stuff so that was my
little crystal and then the little white
roses in the jar and then my little
Eiffel Tower and this ho Eiffel Tower is
from HomeSense this is just like
something that you can like add on to
but I got it from Amazon and then I have
my computer and then over here I just
have one of these serving trays and then
so on top of the serving tray I put my
Noelle candle and this little box thing
that I got both of those are from home
scents with olive then I have all my all
my pens and highlighters right here I
just have some Polaroids from Ryan and I
in the fall time and we're gonna put
these up on our fridge when we move and
then here I just have my agenda which
Marissa Leigh sent me because she is the
friggin bomb I'll leave a link to her
YouTube down below so you guys can go
check it out but this is just my I think
it's called like Erin Condren but I
could be wrong I'll leave like the link
to it down below but she sent me this
agenda because she is like the nicest
person ever and then my desk and chair
are both from Ikea so that pretty much
concludes my little mini office area
actually that concludes my whole room
tour
yes
so that is it for my room tour I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and getting
to see like a little idea of what my
room looks like it had been super highly
requested for me to do one for like the
holiday season since I switched my room
around to make it like more cozy and
wintry so I figured I would do it for
you guys
