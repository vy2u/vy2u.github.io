a haul which is great I don't know why
I'm talking like this as you guys know I
love my hauls I haven't had a haul in a
pretty long time and by pretty long I
mean like probably like a month or two
but still that's a pretty long time for
me so I am doing a winter held today I'm
so excited this year I don't know what
it is I am aggressively excited for
winter this year and I don't know how
long even watching me but if you've been
watching me since last winter and all
that I used to hate winter like I don't
normally like winter at all and it's
cold and it's snowy and it gets dark
really early but lately like this year I
have been feigning winter like I can't
wait for it to get colder I can't wait
for the snow I can't wait to get out
cosy I'm excited for winter fashion like
this is so this is someone like me I
don't know what's happening anyway today
I decided to put effort into my face and
hair I hope you guys noticed so I have a
whole lack of stuff to show you guys
today so I'm going to jump in and just
start showing you the things in the hall
maybe I think you know what I'm gonna
scoot over to the side here so that if
there's a chance I decide to try these
things on maybe a little video will pop
up like right here you have to place a
squeaky toy like the minute I decide to
film a video okay so for starters I
actually picked up a new drop it drop it
Bently good boy here you can take that
this is going away so for starters I
actually got a new phone case I'll do
like a close-up of it so you guys aren't
like what like what is that anyway I
picked up a new phone case I've been
looking for one this sounds so this
sounds terrible now that I say it a lot
but I was looking for a new one for the
winter time because I
like a Victoria's Secret one on it but I
was like some longer I had it on the
more I started to hate it so I don't
know I just wanted a new phone case but
anyway this is one that I got it's like
I think it's like almost black and white
but there's there's a little bit of
color but it's basically just like a
forest a really dark like foggy forest I
don't know I just love it I love this
phone case so that's the phone case I
picked up and I got from society6 so I
will leave a link to it down below if I
can find it Bently stop trying at the
toy hon I promise I'll give it to you
after the video don't be sad okay okay
so first things first I picked up a few
things from forever21 one of the things
that I've noticed that have been lacking
in my closet are like knit sweaters and
I used to hate the way that sweaters
would look on me but this year again I
don't know what's wrong with me I'm
obsessed with them so I picked up a few
knit sweaters the first one here it's
like a cropped one and it's baby pink I
think is gonna look so cute I actually
have an outfit in mind for this so it
was only $19.90 and it's called dusty
pink which actually is a way better
description than I gave and it's just
like a cropped just like a crop to knit
sweater I think this will look really
really cute with either like
high-waisted black jeans or like a
skater skirt so that is the little pink
sweater that I picked up and then next
from forever 21 and I am obsessed with
this I'm so so happy I got this
so this skirt was only seven dollars and
ninety cents like let that sink in seven
dollars for this skirt so this is what
it looks like it is in like an evergreen
which I own nothing in this color I love
how wintery this is it's like a perfect
Christmas skirt or just a winter skirt
in general for your to wear this look
like navy blue or like the pink sweater
or I don't know you could wear this with
a lot of different things next I decided
I wanted an ugly Christmas sweater this
year and then I don't know what happened
it ended up
like an ugly winter sweater not so
Christmasy I might I might do like a
mini little like craft with this sweater
and out of Santa hat but anyway I
decided to pick up this ugly Christmas
sweater it's just got a little penguin
on it and it's so cute and this one's
like a thinner material which I like
because I can find like knit sweaters
can get really scratchy but what I'm
going to do is just like cut out a
little fake Santa hat and just like add
it to it for the Christmas time and then
just make it so I can take it off when
it's done make it nice and easy but that
is the cute little penguin ugly
Christmas sweater that I got and this
one was this one was 2990 I own no
pajama pants how did that happen I don't
know I actually don't like sleeping in
pants I always sleep in pajama shorts
but it still nice to have a nice pair of
pajama pants too late lounge around the
house like on a Sunday and I don't have
any so I picked up this pair from
forever 21 and let's just say I left the
tags on but I still wore them for like
two days if you guys ever watched my
night routine and followed Meggie like
my roommate her snapchat because I don't
have snapchat anymore um we did so many
snapchats yesterday and I was wearing
these pants and I left the tags on
because I wanted to put them in the hall
but these are the pajama pants that I
got probably best purchase I think I've
made in the last like year these are so
comfy so stretchy they're just like the
red navy blue and white plaid they're
just really really basic and they've got
pockets which I love there's just
they're so slouchy and comfy and cozy
and as I mentioned before I have been
picking up more knit sweaters this one's
inside up for me trying it on but I
picked up like one of the super super
thick ones just like a classic good old
knit winter sweater so this is what it
looks like of course I got it in gray
because what other color would I ever
get it in and so this is what it looks
like it's just knitted the only thing is
that this material I find can be a
little bit scratchy and it's super like
slouchy but I like that I'm picturing it
with like a cute little skater skirt
peeking out of the bottom and like
knee-high socks
I just think that'd be so cute like a
little two gone so this is the knit
sweater that I got and this one was 34
90s so that's how much this little
so every was but this it you can tell
this is like really good material it's
really really really thick so then the
last and final thing I picked up from
forever 21 was a poncho and if you guys
didn't know I'm like obsessed with
ponchos this year so this is the one
that I got it's like a white and navy
blue or it's almost like a cream and
navy blue plaid it's gonna be really
hard for me to show you guys a poncho on
camera but the cutest part is like right
here where the arm goes through there's
like a button and it's got little
tassels at the bottom it looks like
you're wearing like a blanket and a
scarf mixed into one if that makes any
sense at all 29 90s so that is the
little poncho that I picked up and again
there's gonna be like blog posts and a
winter lookbook coming with like all of
these clothes in so yes the next store I
have to show you guys is a Charlotte
Russe of course because where else do I
shop these are literally like my to go
to stores so um first off I picked up
this skirt here this one was on for
$10.99 and I think it's so pretty for
the winter so this is what it looks like
it's one of those like tube skirts is
that what they call them I honestly have
no idea it's like black almost like a
brownish burgundy and navy blue and
white and it's just got like almost like
that winter pattern I don't know how to
explain this pattern but it's like a
wintery pattern all over it and so
that's a little skirt that I picked out
like tube skirt wise then next I've been
getting so many questions about this on
my Twitter and on my Instagram because I
posted photos of this sweater but this
is going to be my most worn sweater this
winter I promise you guys that right now
so it is this letter here it's in like a
dark charcoal gray namastÃ© in bed so
that is list I know that I picked up I
love it because the material of this is
so soft and it's so thin so it's gonna
be like perfect for lounging around or
sleeping in and the back has like
buttons going down the hallway they
didn't end up having my size so I
actually sized up to size up I sized up
twice but I'm actually really happy that
I did because it's super like sludgy and
baggy and I love that for like
clothes having like your clothes to be
super baggy kind of like hangs off the
shoulder it's just so cute I'm obsessive
it actually picked up another skater
skirt so this is the last skirt I have
to show you guys I promise but I am
addicted to skirts so this one is it was
16.99 and the colors de but I'm gonna
call it white because that's what it is
so this is what it looks like it's just
like a standard skater skirt it's pretty
stretchy and I just got it in white so I
don't have a white skater skirt and I
think this is gonna look so pretty in
the winter I'm picturing like anyway I'm
picturing a certain blog post like
location in mind for this so it's gonna
be so pretty so that is the white skirt
that I picked up so then I picked up a
pair of high-heeled shoes it's gonna be
really hard for me to show you guys what
they look like like unless they're on so
I will post a video or whatever with the
shoes on right here because it's gonna
be severely hard for me to show you guys
what these look like stick my hand in
here they've got all the straps down the
middle like that and then they tie like
up your ankle this is good this is
getting interesting um anyway that is
what the heels look like they're just
like um black not suede but like kind of
feel like suede I don't know how to
explain things very well guys I'm
working on it next I picked up a body
suit and I love body suits for going
under skater skirts because it keeps you
from having to like tuck things in so
this is the body suit I got it was 16.99
and it is just like this black bodysuit
but it's like off the shoulder so it
goes like this so you literally have
like nothing going higher than like your
arm shoulders so that is the little
black bodysuit that I got I'll probably
be wearing this a lot too so I really
really like it and I like that it's like
a nice thin material so it's not gonna
be too like uncomfortable or anything
and then last but certainly not least I
picked up my winter boots this year holy
moly I am so so obsessed with these
boots I am so excited okay so basically
I needed a pair of like nice winter
boots that weren't just my thugs and I
call them fogs because they're faux ups
but anyway I wanted like a cute pair of
booties for the winter so these are what
I picked up how like
how adorable are these these are these
are amazing they're so freakin cute so
they kind of look like almost like
timberland boots or like worker boots
but they're like the winter version I
don't know maybe I'm explaining that
wrong but anyway they're like a tan
color they lace up and then they have
like this fake fur all over the sides
and they look so comfy the insides are
comfy this is what they look like and
they're just so wintry like they're so
wintry I'm gonna be wearing these so
much this winter and I like that they
have a little bit of a wedge too to give
me just a tiny bit of height so those
are the boots that I picked up for the
wintertime so that is it for my winter
haul I hope you guys enjoyed seeing just
like the things that I've recently
picked up for the wintertime I am
getting so excited and so cozy for
winter it is ridiculous
let me know down below which item in
this haul was your favorite and other
than that I will see you guys all in a
future video which might be a little bit
sooner than you guys think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
