child is flat young we turn to make
goodnight push problems what's up guys
and welcome back to my channel for
today's video I'm doing a vlog style
fitness routine and we're off to a funny
start so it's currently Monday if you're
curious as to why I have this magical
soft robe on it's because I woke up this
morning Greg actually stayed over last
night and we had Mexican food I ate this
like burrito this is like vegan tofu
burrito something before I went to bed
last night I knew that I kind of felt
sick and when I woke up today I was man
down
I was so man down and then I was getting
like hot sweats and cold sweats and
anyway long story short I threw on this
robe and a heated blanket fell asleep
for a few hours and I just woke back up
but I actually I'm starting to feel a
lot better just why I waited to
phoneless intro so that we were starting
the vlog on a better note to then me in
straight editing one of the requests
that I saw recently was to do a fitness
routine so I thought it'd be fun to make
this week's vlog documenting I guess all
of the workouts that I do have been
working out five times a week but I've
also been incorporating the yoga a lot
into my day to day regimen too and like
meditation and eating really healthy and
all of that stuff reason why Greg was
actually over last night is today is
kind of like our one-year just white
last night we hung out we got Mexican
food and all that fun stuff I ended up
making him at this like really cool kind
of DIY like one year book and it's our
photos so it the entire year look right
just called to tell me he's really done
50 minutes I wasn't expecting him for
like at least two more hours I initially
planned on like having dinner made and
like in this whole massive like
sleepover set up haven't even finished
making our photo book yet I think I need
to do a massive multitask right now of
setting up my living room finishing to
print off pictures didn't even get to do
my hair but whatever we're rolling with
it
I'm like rushing to get this book done
and then
you know like you know in the big comfy
couch where she's like get ready for the
ten-second time
when I was in Hawaii was tart they
actually gave us these little photo
printers and I used it to make crank
this like one yearbook of all of our
pictures from the first year of being
together watch planet Earth it was quite
it was it was great yesterday I also did
some yoga just here in my like yoga 5
room
being that I've only been feeling better
for like an hour maybe I won't push it
I'm gonna try and get some work done now
that I'm feeling better and which is why
Monday's video went up late this week
and then within the hour decide what
kind of workout I'm gonna do aside from
that the fitness blog commenced
you hover everything
I try to keep track and this is all I
saw
we literally just got inside from being
outside how could you possibly want to
go more outside crack me up
it is now day two in the fitness vlog
and this morning I actually woke up and
did some flow and some meditation and
then Bentley and I just came inside we
just went for a really long walk it is
so nice out today one of the main things
that I've been really focusing on lately
is making it sure to put like a very
high effort into doing some like mental
workout rather than just physical
workout so you know how like everybody
makes it such a high priority to do
physical workouts and and to work out
their body every day lately I've been
making a huge effort to make working out
my mind a high priority - or not even
just working it out just like giving the
chance to kind of be free and to rest
and to like recharge I guess I went
ahead and did just like a quick I'm not
even kidding you it was maybe five
minutes low like five minutes of
stretches just to kind of open up my
body again you know get the juices
flowing I did some headstands and I felt
so much better and then I took Bentley
for this super long walk ended up
finding out that it is like plus five
degrees which so most people probably
might sound cold but to anyone that
lives in the northern side of the world
that's frickin warm from mid-january so
next up on my list is to go for a run I
haven't been able to run outside in over
a week
aside from when I was in Hawaii it is
sunny it is semi warm and I am like oh
my day has already turned around
it's not even 10:00 a.m. lace up my
shoes no pound some pavement I'm in such
a good mood maybe I'll even just
high-five a tree mall another
it's a dream you'll forget I keep
telling myself wake up it's over
fuck me website and it's currently date
three of me kind of you know documenting
my workouts of the week and today I
ended up going for another run and doing
some yoga slash flow afterwards it felt
really good actually today was one of
those runs are like started running and
because I ran outside yesterday I don't
know if anybody else gets this but when
I run outside it tends to hurt like my
knees more I'm assuming probably because
it's on cement there's no suspension
like on a treadmill so when I went to go
for a run today the minute I hit that
treadmill and I started going it was
like two minutes in it just felt it in
my knee
I kept it kind of light until I warmed
up my knee and then once I warmed it up
ended up running so like it wasn't my
fastest but it was my second fastest 5k
so I'm all good with that also decided
to film this video because exercising
whether it's your brain or your body
because I think they're more intertwined
than I used to believe and it all
started with running I started running
again
to kind of ease my anxiety and then
slowly after that another thing that I
started getting back into again was yoga
it was something that I wanted to really
incorporate into 20:18 and so taking
both of those incorporating strength
workouts and just making myself more
accountable to make sure that I'm
actually working out the difference that
I've noticed in the last even just two
months let alone one month is astounding
so it used to be something that I was
just wishy-washy with I would sometimes
work out a few times a week then I'd
followed up with like one or two weeks
of maybe working out once or not at all
lately I've been sticking to it for days
like on Monday where I really just felt
like sick and like I couldn't push
myself too hard
I'll just at least do yoga at least and
move my body in some way on days where I
wake up and I have one of those instant
moods where I just don't want to crawl
out of bed or when I'm super anxious and
I'm not sure why going for a run doing
yoga even just doing a strength training
or going for a long walk whatever it is
but any form of exercise or movement of
my body
it's like instantly afterwards I feel
like a whole new person especially with
running to such a mood booster because
you literally gonna runner's high
you're just so your endorphins are like
freakin partying it's so hard to be in a
bad mood after you go for a run the
second thing is that it keeps me super
motivated even just in other aspects or
areas of my life when I wake up
and I just like crush out a quick
workout I'm already ready to just to
just crush more things throughout the
day you know as you guys know I've been
eating a lot of foods at home so I cook
really healthy foods or I go up and grab
groceries instead of tako or medley and
I take longer walks now like it just
motivates me to do more even just at
work like after I go for a run and then
I sit down to do work my headspace feels
more clear to be able to just like go at
it because you're already crushed
something else that day like it just it
makes you feel so accomplished which
makes you kind of addicted to that
feeling of accomplishment in other areas
of your life obviously the long-term
health benefits I've been reading a lot
into kind of like health and veganism
and I've watched a lot more
documentaries this year I punch out at
least an hour a week to research things
and that is one of the things I've been
researching how the foods we eat and the
exercise we do affect our body not only
short-term but long-term we kind of
forget that underneath our skin and our
bones or all of these organs that keep
us alive it's building up your
cardiovascular health you're slowing
down you're aging it's just you're
strengthening your lungs your strength
your everything I don't want to wake up
one day and be like shit I wish I would
have worked out when I was a little
younger and be one of those like 60 year
olds that's still teaching a yoga class
you know that's that's my ultimate goal
in life and the fifth thing that I find
keeps me accountable when it comes to
actually fulfilling my workout plan is
even just feeling more in tune with my
body I have found especially through
yoga and running and strength training
like all of it I guess but specifically
there's been times where I'm running or
there's been times where I'm in the
middle of the yoga class and I have pull
a move that I wasn't able to do before
or I beat my fastest 5k and it makes me
feel so in tune with myself because it's
like I'm pushing myself and I'm seeing
the progress right in front of my eyes
and I'm feeling my body work with me
rather than against me I've even just
been reading into has certain spiritual
followings kind of believe that their
bodies are temple for me I don't like to
look at it like my body is more of a
garden and so you wouldn't want to
poison your garden you wouldn't want to
like torch it in Sun and never give it
the night time to rest you wouldn't want
to not water it you wouldn't want to
fill it with foods that don't come from
a garden like all foods come from
the earth and I don't eat meat or dairy
so I truly believe that all Whole Foods
that we need do come from our earth and
so you know nurse your garden with
earthly things right I don't know but
those are like the main five things that
keep me accountable with working out
they'll have to do my yoga flow and
meditation tonight I think I'm gonna do
that before I go to bed just to stretch
out my muscles especially since I'm
feeling a little tense but you know
we'll catch up in a moment
to be gone in a second lemme tell you
sorry
get us care about this
I've been having these little umbrellas
to my smoothies lately and it's just
making everything so extra in the best
way so what's up guys it is officially
now Friday I just showed you guys my
go-to has been like my go-to breakfast
smoothie lately I've been craving a lot
of chocolate and like rich richer
flavors which I find is kind of normal
for the winter time I feel like because
it's so cold and that you're inside and
you're cozy and you're warm like I don't
know it just makes me crave like peanut
butter and chocolate
basically like chocolate banana coffee
three of my like most favorite things so
today I ended up running another 5k 5
kilometers in 24 minutes and 45 seconds
but my run on Wednesday was just a wee
bit faster that said I was creeping all
of my activities on my run keeper it's
this app that you can use to track when
you're running outside you can also just
like log your runs so because obviously
it's winter and I'm running more on the
treadmill I just logged my runs and it
still keeps it in like comparison to how
fast I'm going what my fastest run is
all that stuff and I was creeping all of
my tracked runs since November so back
in November I ran a 5k in 29 minutes and
50 seconds that was my fastest 5k in
November and it is now January and I
just ran it in 24 minutes in 45 seconds
so I've shaved five minutes off with my
5k in three months so now that it's
Friday I'm just getting ready I'm
actually about to drive to my hometown
I'm gonna finish up this smoothie hit
the road to Kingston and I'll catch up
with you guys soon
if you decide to give the smoothie you
try
so what is now the last day of the week
it is Sunday I actually just got home
from Kingston I was in my hometown as
you guys just quickly saw if you were
following me on Instagram you may have
seen my Nana do a muff dive shot my only
thing with this week is that I didn't
get to do any strength training so I
didn't get to show you guys the kind of
strength training circuits that I do so
if you guys want me to make another
video like this and maybe incorporate
even just more of the meals that I make
in the foods that I eat can but this one
was more of like my yoga and my running
obviously on Monday because I was
feeling so sick I just did some yoga and
then on Thursday when I ran out of time
like I'm not overly strict about it if I
don't get my 5 workouts in it's not the
end of the world a lot of you guys have
been asking for a full on yoga routine
which is also something I can do but I
just feel like right now I'm still just
kind of getting to know my own yoga
practice but for me it's just a matter
of kind of moving in a way that my body
feels I mean you just almost follow that
intuitive feeling that you're like wow I
don't know why but my leg just really
needs to be stretched so you stretch
your leg that way and it just it feels
good and you just keep rolling with it
and you chest your instinct and you
trust yourself which is why I like in my
last video I called yoga meditation on
crack you have to get someone tune with
your body and listen to what it needs to
move and stretch I'm still kind of
navigating that and getting to know that
but once I have it down pat I will do a
full video on it let me know if you guys
want me to continue these because I can
definitely do more I think you guys so
much for hanging out with me and you
know running and flowing and stretching
and talking hope you guys are all having
a cozy just full Sunday and aside from
that I'm gonna go flip into some
stretchable gear and bend my body bye
