this channel and with my life
another coffee software sit down without
making myself a coffee Who am I Oh
beds are wrinkled cinnamon on top you
know angle it down look at that it's so
so me and cinnamon and okay now we're
back hey guys what's up and welcome back
to my channel it's currently Thursday I
know that so for today's video I just
didn't seem right for me to go ahead and
upload a vlog as if nothing has been
going on because things have been going
on I actually did well pretty much on
Thursday so yesterday I just kept on
like pushing the blog to the next day
but like the blog's had no context to
them I did a lot this week I ate a lot
of really good food I've been eating
super healthy and I'm so obsessed with
like all the meals of been making lately
and I just that part of my life I'm do
feeling so good about and you know what
I hope to eat a couple times we went to
this place any of you guys that are in
Toronto you need to go called Corinne
brunch and it's like there's so many
vegan options and actually ridiculous
I got a vegan goddess how are we doing
everything in we get the healthy food is
interested in being in goodness what I
was already super sore is your season no
geez I am you are B yes I give you a
cavity disease
I usually using gay people separately
never once again
a lot of this linkage in the business
and have like tofu scramble all this fun
stuff that they gave us vegan pancakes
that pancakes
changed me like say Tuesday I've been
eating really well the other thing I did
a lot of this week was working out I'm
really trying to kill it with going to
the gym and to hot yoga I'm my obsession
with hot yoga has hit a whole new high
my said operation Coachella by Lent in
that part of my life we're not worried
about this is where things get a little
complicated there's like a combination
of things that I think are kind of
contributing to why I'm sitting here
talking 2001 it's the consistency of my
videos and I've gotten some pretty
laborious inches I hear you guys I don't
really like to respond to negativity I
just kind of try and fluff it off you
know not put that extra pressure on
myself because she's me I'm saying it to
myself too guys I just haven't been in a
good headspace the only thing that I
feel good about has been like the whole
eating healthy and working out with
everything else in my life I've been
there's no other way to describe this as
like that what the hell is going on I
think there could be a couple of things
contributing to that one I think it's
kind of like the rush of moving to
Toronto has more an awful little bit - I
recently started going on the pill I'm
on the second week of that now and so my
frickin hormones are out of laptop title
and I cried about it for like 40 minutes
I didn't looked up a lot of the symptoms
and I talked to my doctor I kind of
expected this to happen because I did
try and go on the pill months before
back in 2013 and something very similar
to this happen or thought how freaking
crazy it makes me and trust me I'm not
kidding you I feel crazy there's been
one day in the last week that I haven't
cried you're probably thinking like what
are you doing get off the pill I also
know that if I just write out the first
month everything will start to level I'm
going to give it a month and if I still
feel this crazy I'm getting off of it
there's that I don't even tell you guys
this but a lot of the times vlogging and
filming making videos and hanging out
with you guys and honestly just
everything about this community that
we've built here makes me feel so much
less alone and so I can only hope that
it does the same for you guys I wish I
could respond to each and every want to
do but just know that I always do see
arises messages so I see what you guys
will say that like
videos will know that you or they make
you feel inspired and good and that is
exactly why I couldn't edit that blog
together and I couldn't upload it
because every time I did any sort of
vocal clips in the vols I felt trying to
pretend like I wasn't super upset that
day trying to pretend that I wasn't just
crying my eyes a very low energy and so
I don't want to put that out to you at
all so I'm staying real with you vibe so
here I am explaining it wasn't until the
other night where I was kind of having
like a complete mental breakdown
probably due to the pill but even though
like hormones are out of whack and
they're making me cry like crazy it's
also kind of forcing me to look at my
light the other night I started feeling
super anxious and I didn't know why and
I was pacing around it was very very
late at night that's when the panic
attacks are happening and I had about
four panic attacks all in the span of
maybe like four hours I was trying so
hard to push that feeling away to right
on the edge you're walking like line
you're just trying so hard to keep
yourself on that ledge you're trying so
hard not to push over and so I was
pacing and pacing and pacing and there
wasn't even any general reason that I
was feeling panicky it just was what was
I had panic attacks before I just was
like I've never felt them so immensely
and had so many in such a short period
of time and I think one of the worst
feelings in the world I didn't want to
call anyone because I mean certain
people would just get worried and it
would make them anxious some people and
I wasn't sure if I was comfortable
enough calling it a social anxiety about
calling somebody was so high that I
would rather let myself be terrified
freaking out and panicking then call
somebody and be an annoying like I was
going to make somebody else get anxious
or make somebody else get worried or put
somebody out in like a bad headspace at
four or five o'clock in the morning
again to be mono set sometimes where I
don't text people don't pick up my phone
or I don't not kept my friends and I
don't do these things because my mind I
get into these weird head spaces where
up my phone will ring and I'll be like
oh my god I look connected up right now
I should be trying to do this right now
I see text messages but
like I can't deal with that right now
because the freaking out about subside
when I'm doing nothing I'm doing nothing
and that's my DNA through your text
because I'm trying to figure out what I
should be doing and for a while is like
oh this is a terrible Multi doctor no
I'm just so anxious everything makes me
so anxious I want so badly to blog in
public I want so badly to just be my
freakin self and it's like I can't do it
I'm not going to get upset with you guys
right now I'm telling you this is the
pillow telling you so for any of you
guys that are out there that it felt
that way where you just want so badly to
be yourself but for whatever reason you
feel like you can't I'm such a strong
believer of like you have to be yourself
because if not then you're kind of
stripping the world of the right or the
privilege to get to know who you are and
you're stripping your right to be a
happy person I think this generation
vocal media sells your time as our lives
that we start to find it difficult to be
our real selves because we feel this
pressure to be a certain way to care but
they'll care too much follow your dream
but be smart about that's it so don't
get too fit it's so easy to get laws
like all of this pressure and if you are
somebody that is prone to putting too
much pressure on yourself already as it
is can actually like crush you the only
time I seem to feel myself is when I'm
filming or vlogging with you guys I
don't feel judgment right now I just
feel like I can be me and so yesterday
when I was logging till today I stopped
in the afternoon and I was like I can't
keep treading water when the waves are
crashing over me and I'm just trying to
stay instead I just gotta let myself
sink so that I can swim back to the top
does that make sense I don't know which
company that up just needed to figure it
out at my head screwed back alright get
my priorities back in line aligning my
energy my thoughts and my behaviors with
what I believe in and who I want to be
as a person and that is why I wanted to
make this coffee talk with you guys and
I couldn't just upload the blog as if
you know life is just continuously going
on and nothing really big is happening I
never one of these fake with you guys
last two weeks I've just been going on
in my head that I felt like it wasn't
okay to feel that way I felt the
pressure to be happy and excited
because what was there to feels out of
that what was there to be upset about
what was there to be anxious about there
was no reason being ungrateful or I was
just being negative it's okay to feel
the way you feel I always kind of
promote trying to be more optimistic and
trying to push yourself that was like
these types of breadth of mindsets and I
still do promote those things but I'm
not saying that it's wrong to feel that
way because I wish the last two weeks
someone could have told me that just let
yourself feel that way accept that
that's where you're at so then you can
start asking yourself why instead of
trying to fight it all the time and fake
it all the time it's okay to be confused
and anxious and I mean this could be
different for everyone maybe you need to
vent it out to somebody maybe you need
to go for a long walk and just kind of
think out your thoughts but I like
someone that I need to write things down
sat down with a piece of paper and I
wrote down everything that I felt was
going wrong everything that was making
me anxious everything that was making me
feel icky everything that's going on
with my body inside from what I could
look at it all and be like okay this is
what I'm dealing with I wrote down
everything that I really just wanted to
focus on right now final thing I did was
I wrote down the things I was willing to
sacrifice things like aimlessly worrying
and thinking of those things that aren't
presently in front of me I was willing
to sacrifice eating out sometimes to eat
healthier I was willing to sacrifice
early mornings and some late nights to
get videos done and to get workouts in
willing to sacrifice feeling a little
bit uncomfortable in order to push
myself to get out more agree with
yourself that you're willing to do it
makes it a little less scary because
you're like no it's okay that I feel
uncomfortable right now I knew this was
going to happen and then I do so and did
a bunch of really boring stuff like
sewed up my dry erase in my agenda is
when I got super pumped and excited and
was like planning all these workouts
planning all these videos and planning
all these things that I was going to do
whatever makes you deaky inside go do
that after I also downloaded the OC
which is another thing that put me in a
freaking stellar moon last night was one
of the best nights I have had and I
can't even tell you how long dancing
around my apartment I was cleaning I was
organizing and I was so freaking happy
and just being so present in the moment
and that hasn't happened to me in so
long so if you're looking
or some sort of contest to take from
this video my tips are this number one
is to write down exactly how you're
feeling exactly what you're worried
about everything that's going on with
you everything that you feel could be
contributing to the way that you feel
right now it could even be writing down
that you've been eating a lot more junk
food than usual writing down that you
haven't been working out writing down
that you've been going to sleep late
family situations that are really
stressing you out financial situations
that are stressing you out tip number
two is to write down everything you want
to accomplish everything that you want
to strive towards and this again could
be as simple as being a more optimistic
person feeling more confident working on
your self-esteem working on your social
interactions working on a book working
on a YouTube channel working on getting
super healthy or getting your dream body
getting promoted at work
or getting really good grades in school
tip number three is to write down your
priorities and last but not least tip
number four was to write down my beliefs
I had to come back to every time I feel
like mentality slipping me who you are
so half at the moment one thought at a
time it's no big deal all of it is no
big deal very end of the road without
getting morbid we're going to be dead
and this will all be no big deal
stop making this a big deal I can
honestly say I mean it's always been a
thing okay it's the next day it's the
next morning well it's actually the
afternoon of appeal like a whole new
person and I over exaggerate that a lot
I said that after I tried out yoga for
the first time but I'm serious this time
like I actually feel like cleansed I
feel like it took this huge weight off
my shoulders stop putting so much
pressure on myself stop raining down on
myself so hard anchoring myself and
bringing myself back to what I wanted to
be focusing on what I believe in and
what I'm willing to sacrifice to get
things that I wanted away so sorry this
video was super long felt like I had to
give you guys some sort of explanation
because I couldn't just go on and
pretend like none of that happened you
all have bad days we all have bad phases
we all have bad breath life is just
trying to teach you something give
yourself the like patience and the time
to just figure it out that it's my
coffee talk freeze I'd like a coffee is
ice cold now I hope you have to put
something away from this and
also my videos are going to be back on
track I promise I swear to god you guys
I'm not lying
ghosts honor it is a top priority for me
right now so Monday there will be a
video Wednesday there will be a video
and also maybe server joins or might be
a video just because I owe you I just
want to give you that nice little extra
gift and yeah other than that I will see
all of you guys in my next video
