talking about 10 products I love for
under $10 I've seen a couple of people
do this video recently I think the first
person I saw do it was Samantha Sherman
and then I saw Emily no I'll do it and
I've just been loving these videos
there's just something so satisfying
about loving something that's so cheap
and there are a bunch of products out
there that are under $10 and are really
really good but I picked out 10 of my
absolute favorites okay so I'm just
going to go ahead and show you all the
products
everything is under $10 I'm pretty sure
yeah nothing equals $10 here I will say
that I am going based on like Target
prices because I know the CVS and Ulta
especially their prices are a lot higher
not a lot higher but they're higher than
Walmart or Target like that so I will
suggest that if you're going to go
drugstore shopping go to like Target or
Walmart and not so much like CVS or Ulta
because their prices are more expensive
even if it's just for like $2 those are
two dollars that you can save so I just
wanted to mention that just in case you
see these products like at CVS or Ulta
and they're just a little bit more
expensive they're okay so first I want
to talk about lip products because up
until recently I wasn't too crazy about
drugstore lip products and then all of a
sudden I felt like the drugstore was
making amazing lip products and really
quickly I just wanted to mention the wet
and wild lipsticks because I think
they're amazing I'm always talking about
wedding wow that's one of my favorite
drugstore brands and it is one of the
cheapest and they have amazing quality
lipsticks these are the megaliths
lipsticks these three right here and
they're amazing they are matte they
could be a little bit drying but I don't
mind that at all I love matte lipsticks
and this one right here is the mega
shield lipsticks the mega shield
lipsticks are actually very good I want
to go pick up some more I only have one
but they have really pretty colors and
they're so creamy this one is called
within these adobe walls really weird
name but yeah I love this lipstick and
I've mentioned the megalast lipstick and
don't blink don't blink pink or a
bajillion times
because it's probably one of my favorite
bright lipsticks of all time so if you
get a chance i really suggest checking
out the Wet n Wild mega last lipsticks
they are a dollar ninety-nine and the
mega shine lipsticks are $2.99 which
still is incredibly crazy and amazing um
also in the lips category but not so
much lipsticks and they're not as heavy
as like the mega last lipsticks are the
maybelline color whispers I love these
these are 594 sorry I keep looking down
because I have the prices pulled up on
my phone um yeah at Target or Walmart
they're 594 and they are amazing mix
smell in my opinion they smell really
good like really fresh and they just
they're so creamy on the lips I feel
like they're so most rising and they're
very very sheer they're not going to be
so like BAM in your face like a lipstick
is but they do give enough color this is
going to be like a weird swatch I've
talked about these lips 64 these three
are my favorite out of all of them likes
watching on my wrist but I think that
they are worth the money this one is
petal rebel this is coral ambition and
this is Ola lilac it's like the most
beautiful baby purple if you're gonna
pick one up pick up all of my like it's
like beautiful but I love them so much
they're creamy they smell good
they last a pretty long time and they're
definitely worth the money okay so the
next thing is also another Maybelline
product and they are the color tattoos
which I'm sure you've seen them these
things are exactly the same as like Mac
Paint Pots exactly the same same formula
they last the same these don't crease on
me um I don't know if they creasing
other people but they don't crease on me
and they make my eyeshadow look amazing
throughout the day and they're good on
their own just as basic like cream
shadows just like the Paint Pots they
are literally just like paint pots this
one is called barely branded which is
just like a pretty champagne color
Doug my whole finger in there yeah so
it's like a pretty champagne color this
looks beautiful on your lids like by
itself I love this one this one is
called toughest taupe which you rarely
see like a cream matte shadow and this
one is definitely matte it's like a nice
grey I love this one it's called tough
back taupe and then pomegranate Punk is
another favorite of mine this one is
beautiful under like ran over under yeah
under like cranberry colors or anything
like that and it's just a beautiful like
cranberry purple I love the color
tattoos they are 594 they're six bucks
and if you're one of those people that
just love paint pots but you don't like
how much they cost definitely try out
the Maybelline Color tattoos because
they're probably like my favorite bases
at the drugstore okay so the third thing
I want to talk about our eye shadows and
they are in my opinion the eye shadows
that have the best quality at the
drugstore
I mean fourth thing not third thing
fourth thing and they are the wet and
wild eyes shadows um the single eye
shadows they're a dollar ninety-nine the
trio's they're $2.99 I believe and these
they don't make these anymore but the
six pans are amazing the eight pans are
amazing and they're so cheap they're
buttery they're smooth the pigment is
there they even look good without a
primer under which is kind of rare to
come by especially for drugstore but I
love these this has to be my favorite
one wild palette of all time that's why
I'm showing it to you guys the vanity
palette since they don't sell it anymore
its kind of sucks but you can get it on
Amazon for about three or four dollars I
bought it off Amazon and I just I love
what a wild eyeshadows okay so the fifth
thing by the way I'm not doing this in
order from like favorites to least
favorites they're all really good I just
threw them in front of me
and I'm just grabbing what's closest to
me honestly no particular order anyway I
have to give a shout-out to my NYC sunny
bronzer I feel like I talk about this
all the time but it's $2.99 I feel like
the drugstore lacks and selling matte
bronzer like you rarely find a good
matte bronzer and this is definitely a
good one it's matte like I said and I
feel like it suits fair skin tones I
don't know how well this would look on
medium skin tones just because it's not
the darkest bronzer in the world but
it's great quality it doesn't make me
look orange even though in the pan it
kind of has like an orange tint it
doesn't make me look orange it's amazing
for contouring that's what I use it for
and it's just a really nice lounger and
like I said for three dollars you really
can't beat it
okay so I'm going to talk about another
wet and wild product I just can't get
enough of what a wild and it is my
favorite one wild mascara and it's
probably one of my favorite drugstore
mascaras and it is the mega volume it is
$2.99 which is crazy because I don't
know about you but recently I've been
seeing really expensive mascaras at the
drugstore like Laurie ELLs are almost
ten dollars and stuff like that like
it's pretty expensive and this is $2.99
and so so good I know that they change
the packaging I hope they didn't change
the formula I don't know it's like
fatter now it's still yellow but I know
it's like bigger and I just hope they
didn't change the formula of it because
I love the formula I love the wand I'm
not a fan of rubble rubber um wands but
this is just like you know yeah you
can't see that it's just like the
regular fiber bristle oh my god I can't
talk and it gives me a lot of volume and
it gives me a good amount of length and
I just love it and especially that is
$2.99 and I just I haven't been able to
pick up another one because I can't find
them anywhere everywhere I go the yellow
ones are sold out and I'm not a fan of
any of the other one wild mascaras but
this one is really good and I just can't
find it anywhere
and I've been wanting to pick it up
because that one's completely dried out
I need a new one and I'm just praying
that they didn't
the formula okay so last four things are
not makeup but I would definitely
consider them beauty related the Burt's
Bees sensitive facial cleansing
towelettes these are my favorite makeup
remover wipes and I get the ones for
sensitive skin because a lot of the
wipes that I've used in the past have
just burnt my face and like they stink
so bad and these don't do that they're
so gentle and they're perfect to me
because they're not so wet and they're
not dry how to explain this okay I hate
the Neutrogena um makeup remover wipes I
know a lot of people love them a lot of
people love them but to me I feel like I
am spreading oil on my face when I use
them for some reason I use it and then
my face feels really greasy after I use
it and I hate that and I think it's just
like it's just so wet and oily it's I
don't know I don't know if that's just
me but these are not extremely wet yet
they take up all of my makeup they leave
my face feeling really really clean and
they don't leave my face feeling oily oh
they're $5.99 and I think they're worth
every penny okay so number seven on my
list I discovered a couple of months ago
and I honestly cannot live without it
anymore I will always always repurchase
my batiste dry shampoo this is $7.99 and
honestly I would pay $20 for this okay
maybe not $20 but spray it in your hair
when you're feeling a little oily and it
really just sucks up all the oils and it
makes my hair feel like I just washed it
and it's revered for those people who
don't want to wash their hair every day
I typically wash my hair every four days
it's not good to wash your hair every
day it's really not good to washer every
day so I try not to do that and this is
like a lifesaver um I have the one
that's in fruity and cheeky cherry so it
does it does leave a white cast the
batiste dry shampoo so if you have dark
hair I suggest hitting the brunette one
but it's not something that bothers me
like I spray it in my hair and then I
just like massage it and
and the white cast goes away it really
doesn't bother me
and the batiste is my favorite brand for
dry shampoo I I used the dry shampoo the
Dove one that a lot of people likes and
it was like such a horrible experience
it broke after a week of using it and it
just did nothing for my hair this has
been the best one and I know that a lot
of people love it too
for very good reason I definitely
suggest trying out the Pat East dry
shampoo especially if you have an oily
scalp please please please try this out
okay so the next thing I want to talk
about is the Queen Helene mint julep
mask
this is 379 and it is huge this will
last you forever I don't know how long
about this had it for a pretty long time
but helps it says it helps dry up acne
pimples rinse away blackheads and shrink
and large pores I don't know about the
whole blackheads thing just because I
feel like my blackheads are cemented
into my nose and it takes prayers and
miracles for me to get rid of my
blackheads so not a lot of things get
rid of my blackheads but um it does dry
up acne pimples like big-time you put
this over your face and it really does a
good job of like sucking the oils out of
your pimples and i really suggest you
get this especially if you have a oily
skin I have dry skin so I do not put
this on my entire face I will in the
summer
when my face is not so dry like when I
have more normal to dry skin not like
dry dry skin like I do in the winter but
what I especially love about it is I'm
not a fan of mint I've said that before
but it doesn't smell like toothpaste
does smell like toothpaste to me and it
just leaves your face feeling so tingly
I love face masks that feel like they're
doing something you know what I mean
some extent they feel like they're
working and
feel like they're helping your skin and
leaving like a tingly little feeling and
this sucks up a lot of things off of
your face and I just think it's really
good it's like 379 I just definitely
think it's worth checking out especially
if you have oily skin family skin you
need this in your life you really do
okay so number 10 on my list I really
want to show you just because I think
it's so good for the price and it is
something I've mentioned before I think
it was in one of my favorites videos but
it is the same race instant self-tanning
mousse in dark they say this is like the
cheaper version of the San Tropez mousse
I don't know I've never tried the
Centrify mousse but I get this one off
of Amazon for $4.99 and it is a huge
bottle I don't know where else they sell
this besides Amazon but it's $4.99 and I
think shipping is like four dollars I'm
not sure but it is less than ten dollars
overall and in my opinion there is only
one con to this and it is the smell it
smells like straight-up self-tanner like
you smells and you know this is
self-tanner and how I use this is I put
this all over my body it's not streaky
in my opinion at all I use my hands as
opposed to like a tanning mint because
to me it just gives me a more even
application and I wash it off with soap
for like good five minutes and then the
stains are no longer on my hands and
then in the morning I put on a night and
then in the morning I just wash off like
all the excess self-tanner because you
do it a little dirty on your face when
you use this like when you apply it you
look a little dirty but then in the
morning when you take a shower you have
like the most beautiful natural looking
tan in the world it's it's beautiful
that's what I love about this I do not
look orange at all and I think it's
because I got the dark one I think that
the darker one gives you one ik a bronzy
look as opposed to like an orange one I
just I don't I that's my biggest fear
okay this is to look orange with
self-tanner this makes me look nice and
bronzed I love it and it's so cheap and
I recommend checking it out on Amazon
like I said only colonist a smell but I
can deal with it for something that's
$4.99 okay guys so that's it I hope you
enjoyed this video
these were my 10 products that are under
$10 you can find all these things at the
drugstore or at Ulta Target you know all
those good places and I hope you found
this video helpful and I definitely
recommend checking out any of the things
that I mentioned I love them and yet
that's basically all I have to say thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already I would
appreciate it and I will see you in my
next video bye guys so this besides
Amazon but it's Oh God tame yourself who
loves with themselves for this long but
it's $4.99 okay okay let me apologize I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
