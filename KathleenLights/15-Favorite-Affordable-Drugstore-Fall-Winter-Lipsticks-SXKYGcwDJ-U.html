a really simple easy video I'm gonna be
sharing with you 15 of some of my
favorite affordable slash drugstore
lipsticks I'm gonna leave a little note
right here right here right here telling
you when the actual lip swatching starts
because I have a feeling this intro is
gonna be a little bit long I just have a
couple of things to say before I get
into the video but yes I have like a
bajillion lipsticks as you guys know or
I think you know and I wanted to pick up
a few of my all-time favorite lipsticks
but I wanted to make them affordable
because not everybody wants to spend $30
on a lipstick so I am pretty sure all of
these are under $10 most of them you can
get your local Walgreens Rite Aid CVS
Target Walmart you know I know this
video is kind of simple and boring but I
feel I said this in my last video but I
feel like I'm getting sick I woke up
today with such a like strong pain in my
throat and I've had like one of those
weird foggy headaches in and out all day
my nose has been stuffy I'm in those
like very early stages of getting sick
so I wanted to do a more relaxed
laid-back video where I didn't have to
strain myself too much but I still
wanted to put up a video I hate leaving
you guys hanging so I hope you totally
don't hate this video I hope this video
is helpful for you especially if you are
looking for some affordable lipsticks
for the fall in winter I know I have
been promising I keep oh my god I have
been promising a room tour and a makeup
collection for like a million years and
I'm so sorry those videos are coming
soon I keep saying that but I will put
that that video up like before December
for sure but anyway um if you want to
see a little simple lip swatch video of
15 some of my favorite affordable fall
flash winter lipsticks then keep
watching oh wait wait wait I did only
lipsticks in this video I feel like
lipsticks have been pushed to the side
ever since liquid lipsticks came out
which for good reason I'm obsessed with
liquid lipsticks but I did this just for
lipsticks okay now now you can just keep
watching
if
and
me
you
you
you
okay guys so that completes this video
those were some janky lip swatches I
know towards the end there I got a
little crazy but when you take off a
lipstick and put another one on and then
take it off and put another one on it
can take a toll on your lips and then
all of a sudden you just don't know how
to line your lips it's like a weird
thing but it happens oh by the way I got
a lot of questions in my last video so
this little thing I got that at Macy's
and I got this at Pier one and I don't
remember where I got that Merry
Christmas sign which is starting to
worry me because I got it like last week
so I can't believe I don't remember that
completes this video thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye very early stages
of getting set safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
