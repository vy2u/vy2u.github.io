quick about spontaneous video it was a
huge mess huge mess because I am
cleaning out my closet and I am there's
a tank top on my pallets okay it's a
mess it's a really big mess and I'm just
in my sleeping shirt and it'll have
makeup on and I gotta wash my hair so I
threw it up in a bun so you guys
wouldn't be that scared but you probably
are X it look like a train wreck but
that's okay I'm using natural lighting
right now I'm using my tiny little
window just because I wanted to sit down
and talk to you guys about something
about this what's happened by the way
those of you who asked what lighting I
use I use two of though from dve store
and then a diva ring light from dve
store dve store calm d ve store.com okay
anyway
two days ago i hit a million subscribers
and i sat in my room and I cried and I
never ever thought that that would ever
happen to me in a million years and I'm
not trying to say that to like sound
like oh I never I really never thought
that would happen to me ever I still
don't get it I still don't get it
because there are so many girls and guys
out only on youtube who do kind of like
the same thing that I do and their
editing is like so good and their
background is so good and like they're
really like just good at what they do
and I'm like I'm over here
I suck at editing I'm a nerd and I hit a
million subscribers what I'm so like not
cool so it's crazy I just wanted to make
this video honestly to say thank you for
everyone who's hit that subscribe button
and mainly to everyone who sits and
watches my videos because I may have a
million subscribers but not every single
one of my subscribers obviously watches
all my videos and supports me and I want
to say thank you to you guys
specifically um this is the craziest
thing that's ever happened to me in my
life the craziest thing and I honestly
cannot believe that 1 million little
fingers tapped a subscribe but it
that's like a huge number can you
imagine that's like 1 million I was like
sobbing crying hysterical when I hit
100,000 because I thought that that hey
there's no number that could possibly be
more than 100,000 you know I never
thought I would ever reach anything more
than that my ultimate goal is 100k I was
like if I could ever hit 100k it doesn't
matter how many years it takes but if I
could ever hit 100k I will feel so proud
and so satisfied like I I did it I
freaking did it and then I hit 100k and
I was like the happiest person in the
world and then it kept growing and I was
like holy crap people are like watching
me and subscribing and I just I couldn't
believe it so two days ago when my
sister because my sister was stalking my
YouTube page like so weren't you guys so
many of you guys were like oh my god I
keep refreshing and keep refreshing and
the second I hit a hundred a million
subscribers it wasn't even showing up on
my phone but it showed up on my sister's
and she was like oh my god you did it
and she was like so excited and I got so
many tweets from you guys like
screenshotting the number and
congratulating me and thank you guys so
freakin much for being so amazing and so
supportive and so happy for me because
so many of you guys said that you were
refreshing it and refreshing it and
that's that's so that makes me feel
really good because guys care and that
makes me feel like you're not just
subscribers you guys are friends the
fact that you sat there and like
refreshed whatever
showed the kind of people you are you
guys are great people because getting
some me hitting this big milestone made
you guys excited I made you guys happy
when it doesn't even need to because I
mean who cares right but you guys do I
have the best subscribers because they
are the nicest they're the coolest they
are the best people you guys you guys
are awesome and caring and I and I see
that I see all your hey what you doing
Oh kisses weenie my weenie girl it means
so much to me so I just wanted to make a
video saying thank you for 1 million
subscribers because I never
in a million years that I would that I
would hit this if you would have asked
me a year ago if I would have ever hit a
million subscribers I probably would
have laughed in your face just thinking
back on like my journey and starting out
on the floor of my bedroom where I had
no furniture and just sitting there and
talking to you guys on the floor and
just having a conversation and I was so
nervous to talk to the camera my first
videos were a hot mess because I was
just so so so nervous it was just this
little hobby I was doing on my days off
from work when Danny was off at work and
I had the day off and I just turned my
camera on and decided to put her on
YouTube and I'm so grateful for that and
then Danny built my desk the desk that
you guys see in my background all the
time
he took days and days and days to build
me like my dream vanity just so that I
could have a place to store my makeup
just so that I could potentially turn
this into something and you know he
really believed in this dream I had I am
so grateful and just looking back on how
far my videos have come even though they
haven't come super far you know I'm not
like an editing genius like I said but
it's just so crazy to see the things
that have happened in my life and
deployments you guys have been with me
through and so many houses I've moved to
and just trying my best to always put
videos up three times a week and I just
work so hard to try do what I can for
all of you and I write down all the
requests I read and even though I don't
write back to every single comment some
comments are perfect that I can't write
back I remember them and I remember the
people who always comment and I
appreciate everything so I just wanted
to say thank you from the bottom of my
heart thank you so much for 1 million
subscribers and I appreciate all of you
I do want to say that this video was a
last minute thing today's Wednesday I'm
posting this today the video that was
supposed to go up today cuz you guys
know I post Mondays Wednesdays Fridays
the video that was supposed to go today
I'm gonna post it tomorrow so don't you
worry and I will be having a huge
giveaway on my channel to thank you guys
for 1 million subscribers I actually
just purchased a couple things on
Sephora I'm waiting for them to get
and to add them to the things that I've
been collecting for you guys
and it's pretty big so I'm gonna do two
winners and that should be coming up
very soon within the next one or two
weeks so if you are a loyal subscriber
of mine make sure you watch my videos
because I don't want it to say like give
away the title will say something else
just so people won't watch it just to
win Oh giveaway that makes sense
so anyway I will be doing a huge thank
you for one night subscriber giveaway
very soon I love you guys and again
thank you so much I love you and I'll
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
