a two looks using one pallet kind of
video before this video starts I do want
to say something about my message board
okay here's the situation and since
there were two looks in one video the
day that I filmed the blue look I had
put unagi on my message board like it
says unagi and the other look but you
can't see it so if you don't see the
other board that says unagi you're gonna
look at this one that says salmon skin
ruin you're gonna be like what does that
mean
but that's why so the board was a fail
I'm sorry just pretend it's funny and
that you get it okay bye I've done a
couple videos like this in the past and
you guys seem to really like them I mean
I haven't done that many I think I've
done like two or three on my channel but
it's always so requested especially
recently with the dream street palette a
lot of you guys have been asking me to
do two different looks using this
palette so that is what I'm doing for
you guys today this is the first look
it's a very dramatic brown smokey eye
but it does have its pop of color with
the pink and I think it looks so cool
it's very grungy and colorful but still
wearable and I weren't the other day and
I thought oh my gosh I definitely need
to do a tutorial on this look because I
really like her it turned out but the
second look is a little bit more blue
and colorful and fun so I really hope
you enjoy both of these looks but I'm
just gonna be showing you guys the eye
makeup in this video well that's a lie
the eyes my bronze are my blush my
highlight and my lip so my foundation
concealer and powder is already on for
both of these looks just so that this
video won't be a million years long and
you guys have seen me apply foundation
like a trillion times so I thought I
would skip over that and just focus on
the eyes and then the accessories of the
face and I did want to mention something
really quick I'm gonna put a little time
stamp right here letting you know when
the tutorial starts just in case you
don't care about this but I'm actually
wearing the Marc Jacobs shameless
foundation again because in the second
look that's when I tried out the
foundation for the very first time when
I did my wear test first impressions I
had worn that foundation for the first
time and it looked crazy you can't even
see in the close-ups like the foundation
just looks horrible on my nose but I'm
actually wearing it again today I wanted
to try it out a second time but use the
k-t technique I don't know if you guys
watch
mr. Lux Katy she did a whole video on
this foundation and she said she didn't
like it
until she like drenched her face and
fix+ and then it looked really really
nice so I tried that out today and I
really liked it I know that's weird I
definitely need to play around with it a
little bit more but I think setting the
skin is key with this foundation it
doesn't look dry like it did I mean you
can see my skin I'm wearing the same
foundation in both looks yet for the
blue look my skin looks crazy and I know
that seems ridiculous like why do I have
to try so hard or such an expensive
foundation when I can get something at
the drugstore for cheaper but I didn't
notice when I first reviewed this
foundation then it didn't sink into my
smile lines and I really appreciated
that so I really wanted to make it work
because of that and I feel like I might
I might have just found the way to make
it work thanks Katie I just wanted to
let you know in case you're wondering
what foundation I'm wearing for both of
the looks I mean I'm gonna list
everything I'm wearing down below as
usual but just so you know I think I
might be making this foundation work
that was so random I know but okay
anyway
I really like how these looks turned out
and if you want to see how to get two
looks using Dream Street then just keep
watching okay so for lick number one the
first eyeshadow I'm gonna go into is
shooting star and I'm gonna start using
this color as my transition shade I'm
gonna start buffing this into my crease
by the way I'm getting over my cold but
my voice is still a little bit like you
know nasally a little bit so just ignore
that but I'm just buffing this into my
crease you know you guys know I'm gonna
take this single shadow from colour-pop
this is a super shock shadow and this in
the shade mittens and I actually created
elfish based off of mittens but mittens
is a little bit more purple and I want
this look to have just a hair more
purple to it so I'm gonna put this as
kind of like my base shade I'm applying
this on my entire lid and then blending
out the corners or the edges and then
I'm gonna take the shade spark and I'm
gonna start applying this color into my
crease little by little and I'm gonna
start blending those two colors together
this look requires a lot of blending and
it is gonna look pretty messy before it
all comes together but just keep pushing
through so I'm gonna take elfish and I'm
gonna apply this color directly on top
of mittens so you can see they're very
similar colors elfish is just a little
bit more Brown
so you don't have to put the mitten
shade you can just go in and make it
like a matte brown smokey eye it's just
gonna be a little bit less purpley but
it still looks really pretty I've done
that before as well and it looks nice so
I'm gonna go back in to spark and I'm
just gonna keep on blending this color
into the crease applying the shade a
little by little and really blending out
those harsh lines
I'm gonna highlight my brow bone in my
inner corner with Moony as usual and
then I'm gonna go back into elfish and
I'm gonna start working on my lower lash
line
super easy look anybody can do this I'm
gonna start buffing this color on my
lower lash line like I said really
intensely I added a lot of that elfish
color I want my lower lash line to be
very very smoky I went in with some
black eyeliner eye tight lined with it
and I applied it to my waterline as well
and then I used spark to smoke out my
lower lash line even more I wanted to go
in with some falsies for this look but
first I took the Clinique high impact
mascara and I applied that to my lashes
my top and bottom lashes but the falsies
I went in with are the kiss falsies
they're in the shape they're in the
style Daisy I like these because they're
nice and fluffy alright so I cannot put
on my falsies today my eyes keep
watering I don't know if it's because
I'm kind of getting over my cold and
everything is still kind of watery I
don't know but I cannot put my eyelashes
on and they're all there they look crazy
I'm not gonna let it stress me we're
just gonna pretend they look really
fabulous if you have issues with falsies
I think mascara works perfectly fine
alright so to finish up this look I'm
going in with bronzer I'm using the
chocolate Soleil bronzer from Too Faced
and I'm gonna use this to contour and
bronze up the skin
for blush I'm taking the physician's
formula but a blush in the shade vintage
rose and I'm popping that on my cheeks
and then for highlight I'm testing this
guy out this is brand new to me this is
the NARS highlighter in the shade Capri
Capri this is new and I really like this
formula it looks really really pretty
but I'm still testing it out so I don't
know for sure but I like it so far
and then for my lips I'm going in with
one of my favorite lip liners of all
time this is the Maybelline Terra lip
liner and I'm just filling in my entire
lips with it this is the Gigi Hadid lip
liner I'm obsessed with it I love it and
then I went over it with my colour-pop
ultra glossy lip in moonchild and then
here you have look number one super easy
to recreate but very dramatic which is
my favorite kind of look and then from
look number two we're gonna jump into it
we're gonna take the shade magical and
I'm gonna start buffing this color into
my crease and this part takes a little
bit of time because I'm applying a lot
of magical and this shade is actually
pretty magical because the more you
apply like the darker it gets and it
starts to look pretty peachy so I
applied a bunch of that magical shade in
my crease and then I applied mooney as
my brow bone highlight and then I went
in with shooting star and I started to
apply this on the outer corners of my
eyes and I'm also bringing this color
into my crease as well just to like
combine those two shades I really like
the color it creates then I'm gonna go
into potion this is like the star well
not the star the star is the blue but
this is like an assister star and it is
such a pretty rich like terra cotta
shade and I'm gonna start applying this
on my outer corners but I'm also
dragging this color into my crease as
well I'm gonna take the shade magical
again and I'm gonna use this color to
blend out that potion so I'm just like
sandwich in these colors together and
making sure there are no harsh lines and
then for that cut crease effect this is
kind of like a half cut crease I'm gonna
take this glossy a concealer in the
shade light any concealer works and I'm
just carved carving carving out my
crease but only halfway and then I'm
gonna take the blue in the palette it's
called mermaid boy and I'm going to
apply this on my
entire lid everywhere I put down the
concealer I'm not using this color with
any fix+ at all it just looks so intense
when you lay it on top of concealer it's
pretty amazing
so first I only wanted it like on half
of my lid but then I decided you know I
want to take this blue all the way
across so that's what I did and then I
took a little bit of elfish and I start
blending that color on the outer corners
I want the look to go from like blue to
like the dark brown on the outer corner
so I'm just applying a bunch of that
color and then so everything looks nice
and blended I still want the cut crease
like the cut crease effect to show up
but I want things to be very blended in
the crease so I took the shade potion
and I'm just using this on a smaller
brush to really blend out the harsh
edges in my crease we're gonna take
magical one mo time and I'm gonna start
blending this color on my lower lash
line I'm applying a bunch of this color
again on my lower lash line and then I'm
gonna go into potion and I'm gonna do
the exact same thing I'm just a being a
little bit more precise with potion not
as messy for eyeliner I'm using the same
eyeliner this is em cosmetics eyeliner
in black it's amazing my tight lined I
would put it on my waterline as well and
then on a very very precise tiny little
brush I'm gonna go in with the straight
elfish and I'm really gonna blend this
color super close to my waterline so
that everything looks nice and smooth
and then for my inner corners I took the
wet and wild like loose Gotha graphic
highlight in the shade moon tears pop
that on my inner corners and then I went
in with mascara this is the Maybelline
and Gigi Hadid fiber mascara I applied
that everywhere and I love this mascara
it makes my lashes look crazy so I
thought you know what I'm gonna skip the
falsies today for a bronzer I'm gonna
take my Thrive cosmetics rheya bronzer
and dude I don't know if it was the
foundation my bronzer was just not it
was just not like it wasn't corrupt
cooperating with me at all I tried
different brushes and I don't know I
think it was the foundation it was
looking a little harsh but moving on I
took a little bit of Mac peaches blush
pop that on my cheeks and then to
highlight I wanted to take the same
highlight I used on my inner corners
this is the wedding wild
tears loose highlight and it's a little
bit too glittery for my face you guys
know how I feel about glittery
highlights so I took the innuendo
highlight palette from colour-pop took
this shade and pop that right on top of
the Wet n Wild highlight to try that fix
the situation and then to finish off the
look I went in with the Wet n Wild
liquid lipstick in nudist peach which
really does just tie everything together
but that completes this video guys I
hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
