a two looks using one eyeshadow palette
makeup tutorial and the eyeshadow
palette I will be using is the
minimalist eyeshadow palette by the
brand LC I've recently got him into the
LC brand a little bit more I started
using her primer I wasn't a huge fan of
her foundation but I really liked the
primer and when I saw this I was like oh
my gosh this palette is so me it's a
very basic warm tone eyeshadow palette
with five eyeshadows and they're
honestly the five eyeshadows that I
would normally reach for anyway you have
a beautiful vanilla cream a matte black
a chocolate color and then warmer
transition shades this is literally my
perfect on-the-go travel palette it's
awesome it has a mirror when I first
opened this and i swatched them I was
like oh my gosh so I really wanted to do
two different looks to show you how you
can use just these simple eyeshadows two
different ways the first one being this
one on my eyes it's a very warm tones
everyday kind of look but I made it a
little bit more bold by adding some
colored eyeliner you can make this one
extremely wearable by eliminating the
blue eyeliner and then I wanted to show
you something a little bit more deep and
sultry and smoky so I went with a really
black smoky eye which is perfect for
special events perfect for clubbing
birthdays and I love a good smokey eyes
so I hope you enjoyed this video it is
mainly two eyeshadow tutorials because
if I did my entire face both times I
feel like that would be a little bit too
crazy so I'm doing mainly my eyes but I
do show you my bronzer my blush my
highlight and my lip color so the only
thing I'm not showing you in this video
is my foundation my concealer and my
powders so you want to see how to get
this fun so I think it's fun it's really
cool warm and blue kind of look then
just keep watching okay so I'm priming
my eyelids with the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion and enigma
forgive me my voice is a little little
weird because
SiC I set down that primer with some
face powder and then I applied some tape
to the side of my eye to create a sharp
cat eye look I'm going into the LC
minimalist palette and I'm taking that
warm brown color and I'm using this to
apply to my crease and I'm putting this
pretty much everywhere I want to end my
crease on the outer corners a little bit
higher than my crease I want this color
to be very blown out just not touching
the inner corners I want that part to be
bare but pretty much everywhere else
going back into the eyeshadow palette
I'm taking this warm orange --red shade
and I'm focusing this closer to the tape
I'm focusing this on the outer corners
and then dragging it into my crease I'm
applying most of the pigment right at
the corners like right where the tape is
and then I'm dragging that color in and
then I'm going to go into this matte
chocolatey well they're all matte I'm
going into this chocolatey deep brown
and I'm doing the exact same thing only
I'm not taking it as far as I took the
orange shade I'm focusing this one a
little bit closer to the tape I took a
clean brush with no eye shadow on it and
just kind of softened out the edges and
then I took this creamy vanilla shade
and I use this to highlight underneath
my brow bone a little bit okay so and
I'm going to do my winged eyeliner and I
didn't want part to be a voiceover
because I feel like it's going to be
difficult to explain I don't have a
royal blue eyeliner like this please
leave me a comment down below with a
really great recommendation of a royal
blue eyeliner I have tried the Tarte one
that comes in a little pop but I don't
like it's like a shimmery color so I'm
looking for either a pot or a felt-tip
royal blue eyeliner like this but for
today what we're going to use is the
Urban Decay electric palette I do this
all the time whenever I want a blue
eyeliner this palette is pretty old I've
had it for a long time now so I think
it's time for me to get a new one but in
the meantime I've been using the blue as
eyeliner so obviously this stuff takes
up more time than it should honestly I
don't have a blue eyeliner if you have a
blue eyeliner you can go ahead and use
that or you can use a black eyeliner if
you don't want to do a blue use whatever
you have them but what I'm going to do
is I
scraped off a layer of the chaos eye
shadow from the Urban Decay electric
palette I used my morphe b71 brush this
little spiky thing and I just scraped
off some products and I put it in a
little oh this is a mess I put it in a
little water bottle cap and then I
applied some NYX multitasker mixing
medium inside the cap and I mix it all
together and it created a blue gel liner
it isn't perfect is a little bit cracky
but it's not too bad and I really like
the pigmentation so I'm going to use the
products I have left over from doing
this eye and I'm just going to do my
typical winged I don't want it to be
like a super intense wing let's see if I
can make it so that it matches this one
because I suck at winged liner ah wait
okay so I forgot something before I
finished doing my winged eyeliner I do
want to add a little bit of that creamy
vanilla eyeshadow to the inner corners
this color right here I'm going to do
that first and then I'm going to finish
up my winged liner
I'm going to go back into the palette
and I'm going to take that chocolatey
shade we used earlier and I'm just
applying a little bit of this right in
the outer corners just to add a little
bit of depth after we added the eyeliner
now to finish up the lower lash line I
already applied my foundation all of
that I'm going to take the light brown
shade in the palette and I'm going to
smudge this on my lower lash line and
then I'm going to take the dark brown
and on a smaller pencil brush I'm going
to focus this on the outer corners and
I'm not going to drag that color in I
wanted to just come in halfway and then
I'm going to go back into the lighter
brown and smudge everything out for my
waterline I'm taking the Marc Jacobs
Highliner
gel crayon in the shade out of the blue
it's a really pretty matte cobalt I'm
putting that on my waterline and then
I'm going to curl my lashes and pop on
some benefit roller lash mascara for my
inner corners I'm going to take my girl
lactic luminous face mail in the shade
see-through and I'm going to pop that on
my inner corners and then just to show
you what the rest of my face looks like
I applied some bronzer this is the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer in the shade
sweet pea just bronzed up my skin and
then I took my essence puree hightlight
pure new highlighter on a fluffy brush
and I kind of put this everywhere
because I thought my face is a little
bit too matte I wanted to glow all over
the place just a little bit and then for
blush I went in with my sleek blush in
the shade suede I love this blush and I
think it complements the eyeshadows so
well another so much for highlight I'm
going back into my
luminous face veil in the shade
see-through I use this like right now
like a few seconds ago and I'm going to
highlight the rest of my face with this
product and putting it on my cheekbones
on my nose above my brows like all over
the place and then I'm going to set my
makeup down using my Milani and make it
last setting spray I can't get enough of
this I'm like running out of it a lot
faster than I thought I would I'm going
to mix two lip colors today I'm going to
take two ofra liquid lipsticks this one
is in the shade americano I'm going to
put that one on first and then I'm going
to go over it with the shade by layer I
wanted something warm and deep but not
too deep but I didn't want something too
nude either so I like this combo and
yeah this is
I had a look number one and let's get
into look number two it's a really deep
intense black smoky eye and I loved it
so I already primed my eyelids they're
good to go and I'm going to go into the
light brown shade in the palette and I'm
going to start buffing this color into
my crease and windshield wiper motions
this is going to be our transition shade
so you want to make sure you're really
buffing this color in because we're
going to be doing a lot of blending with
this look a lot of blending I'm taking
the dark brown in the palette and on a
smaller crease brush I'm focusing this
right at the crease now we are going in
with the black so I'm taking a flat
shader brush and I'm applying this to my
entire lid this eyeshadow is very very
black you don't need a black base
underneath I think it's a pigmented
enough but you do have to build it up
but it is very very pigmented I'm going
to go back into the dark brown and I'm
just going to start blending out this
black eye shadow you really want to take
your time with this just focus this
brown color into the crease go back and
forth going back into the light brown
and just buffing everything out lots of
blending I'm going back and forth with
these shades just making sure that
everything is nice and seamless and that
there are no harsh lines going into that
vanilla shade and I'm going to clean up
underneath my brow bone and then I'm
just going to do the process all over
again because when you blend so many
colors in the crease the blade the
belief the black will fade away so just
repeating all the steps all over again
working those two Browns in the crease
and then I'm cleaning up all of the
fallout and then I went in with my
foundation concealer and all that good
stuff I'm going to tightline with the
Marc Jacobs eyeliner in the shade
blacker and then for my lower lash line
I'm going into that brown shade and I'm
just muggin this really really close to
my waterline I do want the lower lash
line to be nice and smoky so I'm
building that color up then I'm going in
with the light brown shade and just
blending it all out I want it to be
smoky but I don't want it to be too
harsh so I'm making sure I'm blending a
lot and then I'm going in with a smaller
pencil brush and I'm going to take it
black and I'm going to put this as close
to my waterline as possible I don't want
to drag the black
too far down and then for my waterline I
applied that same Marc Jacobs eyeliner
and just blend it out some more with the
light brown because the vanilla shade is
pretty much the exact same color of my
skin I want to highlight my brow bone
even more so I'm thinking the city color
intense exposure highlighting powder to
highlight my brow bone and my inner
corners just a little bit for a pop of
glitter on the lower lash line I'm
taking the Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter in the shade Midnight Cowboy I
think it adds such a nice little pizzazz
then I'm going to take this gold
highlight in this Maui duo and I'm going
to pop this on my inner corners just add
a little bit more of a pop of gold I'm
then going to pop on some mascara on my
top and bottom lashes and then I'm going
to go in with these falsies bye kiss in
the in the style flirty and then
that completes the eyes and now I'm
going to work on the skin I'm going to
take my Physicians Formula but at
bronzer and I'm going to contour and
bronze the skin with this as well and
then I wanted to just warm up the skin
even more so I took this Milani baked
bronzer in the shade dolce and with a
stippling brush I just applied this
pretty much everywhere I wanted to look
really bronzed with this look since the
in the eyes were so intense I'm going in
with my cover effects loose translucent
setting powder and I'm going to bake
underneath my contour just a little bit
I'm not going to leave it on too long
I'm literally going to blend it away
almost instantly because I don't want it
to look too intense but this is just
going to clean up the contour and make
it look a little sharper for blush I'm
taking the Milani powder blush in the
shade warm petals it's such a pretty
bronzing nude I love it
and then I'm going to take that same
Mally highlighting and blush duo in the
shade effortless peach and I'm going to
take the highlighter in the palette and
I'm going to pop it on my cheeks I
wasn't feeling that brush I was just
using so I switched to the Real
Techniques setting brush and I just
highlighted my face with that then I
applied my setting powder and I finished
with my lip color I lined my lips with
the bite lip pencil in the shade
0:20
and I went over it with the white high
pigment pencil in the shade Madeira I'm
obsessed with this color it's such a
beautiful nude and then on top of that I
took the Marc Jacobs lip gloss in the
shade sugar sugar okay guys so that
completes this video I hope you guys
like this two looks using one palette I
actually love how this one turned out so
much I think it's so sultry and sexy and
I know it looks really intimidating and
kind of scary at first but once you
blend everything and pop on lashes and
put on like concealer and do the whole
thing it all ties together just don't
give up until you get to the end with
this one because I know it can get
discouraging when you look like you have
two black eyes just keep going keep
blending and wait till you get to the
end but yeah I absolutely love this
palette it's such a simple palette but I
feel like it can do so much so I really
really love this anyway so yeah like a
mix video I hope you guys enjoyed thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye hey
crafters okay
and I love how bro and I just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
