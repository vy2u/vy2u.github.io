two first impressions in 1/2 where tests
in one and just finish running and I'm
so out of breath whoa I need to work out
more the Sun is blazing through my
windows this morning if I'm washed out
that is why it is pretty early I mean
it's not early it's ten o'clock in the
morning ten eleven to be exact and like
I was saying we're doing like a wear
test first impressions tip a video today
I was actually only going to dedicate
this entire video to this bad boy right
here I'm so excited to use this look at
this beauty it's like hats
it's think you want to touch it cuz it's
so hot you know I think this is the new
Fanta beauty Stunna lip paint it says
it's a long where fluid lip color
basically a liquid lipstick that's
supposed to be long wearing I am so
excited to try this out
she only has one shade that has released
so far and it's called uncensored and
they say it's the perfect universal read
for everyone and I'm so excited this
color looks first of all this color
stunning and not only that this
packaging look at this it looks like a
really fancy nail polish doesn't it it
is beautiful when I saw the packaging on
this I was like Rihanna that's amazing
I love it it is so beautiful and it is a
$24 product which i think is pretty fair
for Sephora there's a ton of other
liquid lipsticks that are pricier than
this but anyway I was gonna dedicate the
entire video to this product but then I
got this in the mail I just purchased
this and I was like you know what I'm
just gonna include it in today's video
kind of do like a twofer this is the
ordinary coverage foundation now I've
heard a lot of buzz about this
foundation they have two of them they
have the coverage foundation and they
have the serum foundation I think the
serum foundation is the new one
but I picked up the coverage money well
I picked up both of them but I got a
color that was way too light for me in
the serum foundation so we're doing the
coverage foundation today and I picked
up the shade 2.0 n which is 2.0 neutral
I'm assuming and I really wanted to try
this out because this is a six dollar
foundation well it's 697 bucks for a
foundation that is so affordable and
I've heard mixed reviews I gotta be
honest I've heard like horrible things
but I've heard really great things as
well I'm just nervous as we're gonna
break me out but I don't know we shall
see I love the packaging of this
like the soft touch oh my gosh I love it
so we're gonna be putting these two
products to the test I'm gonna be
wearing it throughout the entire day
we'll see how the liquid lipstick looks
at the end of the day and the foundation
at the end of the day so I know this is
random pairing these two together but I
thought why not okay so before I put on
the foundation I'm gonna pop on my
primer this is the Beca first light
priming filter I have been back to using
this guy let me take my hair out of my
face and zoom you in a bit as well okay
so I'm gonna do half of my face with a
damp sponge and the other half with a
brush because I don't know which way I'm
gonna prefer so take this up and take a
couple pumps on the back of my hand I
love that it has a pump by the way super
useful
and supposedly this is a high coverage
foundation which it does seem to be
covering a lot I state seems like really
good coverage actually so it's also
alcohol-free and oil-free and they have
21 shades I will say that I think this
might be oxidizing okay so yeah this
foundation is definitely oxidizing can
you see the difference
okay so I added another layer to that
and I have to say I really like the
finish of this foundation it does
oxidize not oxidize it does get darker I
just recently found out the true meaning
of oxidize it just gets like a shade
deeper
once it starts stripping once it starts
drying you know so I really love the
finish of the sponge I don't know if I'm
going to love the finish with a brush I
might have to go over it with the sponge
we shall see but I'm just gonna put some
on my love is the foundation it
cosmetics brush I'm gonna start buffing
that in I really like this finish it
looks very natural on the skin it has
really good coverage and I don't think
it's too matte and actually it's pretty
dewy it is a little bit tacky when you
touch it as well yeah I would say this
is like a more like natural dewy
foundation like you can see the glow on
my skin which I'm not complaining but
just to warn you guys if you don't like
a little bit of do oh it's actually a
place really nicely with a brush as well
I'm super impressed I thought I was
gonna look a little heavy but it doesn't
okay so I definitely think it applies
beautifully with both a brush and a
sponge but I do think any sponge site
it's just a little bit do we or I don't
know let me just even even all that out
it is definitely getting darker I'm a
little bit concerned I'm just gonna go
ahead and finish up the rest of my
makeup the rest of my face makeup my eye
makeup and all of that and then I will
be back to apply this Stunna so BRB now
it's time to apply uncensored the
applicator is very interesting it has
like this little nubbin like this little
ball I don't know it's very interesting
I'm really excited to see how this feels
on the lips cuz I don't think I've ever
applied a lip product that has this kind
of applicator before so let's see this
says it's a weightless 12 hour liquid
lipstick with a soft matte finish
I'm actually pretty terrible at applying
liquid lipstick
very very liquidy nervous
well it's so easy to do the top part of
your lip because it's so small and round
it like perfectly applies it on the top
I struggled a little bit on my bottom
lip but the top lip is easy to apply
okay so the liquid lipstick has
officially dried I tried to make it I
tried to perfect it as best as I could
and this is what we're working with I
really love this color I think it is
stunning
I have a nail polish in my winter
collection that would match so perfectly
with this nail polish I mean with this
lipstick it is gorgeous I love this
color but we still need to see how this
wears throughout the day and what it
looks like let me do the kiss test okay
so it does transfer a bit it's not
completely matte I don't know if that's
just right now maybe it'll settle and
get more matte as the time goes on coz I
just applied it a couple minutes ago but
it feels very comfortable it's not
sucking the life out of my lips but it
does look nice and matte so I mean so
far so good I didn't want to mention the
foundation so when I was applying my eye
makeup I did my concealer and all of
that
I noticed it stopped getting darker so
that's nice but I will say oddly enough
oh my gosh I just realized it didn't
zoom you guys in when I was done
applying my foundation I'll still give
you a close-up now it's just not the
same because I have powder bronzer all
of that but anyway I noticed when I was
applying my bronzer it was applying
pretty patchy this side is okay but this
side I struggled with I noticed I had
like holes in my bronzer and I honestly
think it's the foundation because I used
my Too Faced my Too Faced sweethearts
bronzer that I use all the time one of
my favorite bronzers ever and I never
have that problem so I think it was the
foundation and could have been that I
only said it a little bit I got a little
bit of my RC amino color powder and I
just lightly set the rest of my face
when I was done setting my under eyes so
maybe I didn't set it enough I think
this might be the kind of foundation you
really have to set down and then apply
your powder products on top because it
might skip on the foundation because I
did notice some patchiness here I tried
to fix it but the actual finish of the
foundation is really pretty but anyway
let me zoom you in okay so this is the
foundation on the skin you can't really
tell that much the finish is really
pretty
and it took a $7 foundation that's crazy
so like I said a couple little cons
there but for the most part uh-oh what
is what is that did I get lipstick on my
temple I actually have a few things I
have to do today I have to go to Cole's
have you errands to run and then we will
check in and see what this looks like at
the end of the day so let's do that
hello guys I'm back it is to 2:19 I was
gonna say 2:15 on the way but it is now
2:19 I've had this makeup on for a
couple of hours now I don't remember
what time I finished my makeup couldn't
even pass the eleventh I've had my
makeup on for about three hours now so
not that long at all and let me look in
the mirror okay so the liquid lip has
transferred a bit let me zoom you in
okay so this is my makeup after three
hours you can see here my liquid lip has
transferred onto my chin I had some
mashed potatoes and some soup I know
it's a really strange combo but don't
judge me so it did transfer a bit and I
do not like that because I'm very
self-conscious about red lips especially
if I'm gonna go out at night I don't
want to have to be worried about it
ending up on my chin but that's probably
because I was eating and then there is
fading like around the actual liquid let
me zoom in even more it's bleeding just
a little bit here on the outer corners
it's probably because I didn't use a lip
liner I'm sure this is easily avoidable
if you just use a lip liner underneath I
just didn't want to use it for the sake
of this video but whenever I put on a
red lip I most of the time put on a lip
liner underneath not only does it help
you get like the perfect application but
it helps your liquid lipstick from
bleeding or any other lipstick from
bleeding so I mean it sucks cuz it's
only been three hours but I'm not super
concerned because I think with a lip
liner I should be fine as for the
foundation I think it looks pretty good
it's only been three hours but it's
holding up well the only thing I will
say I don't know if I'm crazy when I
look really closely I feel like I'm
seeing little bumps underneath the
foundation like if it's your attaining
my skin a bit I don't know I see little
bumps at least I noticed earlier like in
the sunlight I was like hey are those
like bubbies under my skin but maybe I'm
crazy I'm actually gonna go now to
Cole's
I'm gonna go with my mom and then when I
come back I'll probably update you guys
or I'll probably see you guys at the end
of the night okay
I am back for my final check-in here to
wrap up this video and tell you my
thoughts and boy do I have some thoughts
okay so it is 7:30 p.m. right now so
that means my makeup has been on for
like nine hours which i think is a good
a good test let me start with the liquid
lipstick okay it's not looking the best
but honestly I think that is a quick fix
with a lip liner but yes it is bleeding
around the edges and after so many hours
it does look very dry on the inside of
my mouth like you can see right here it
looks so cracking but my lips were very
dry today anyway like I've had some I've
had some dry lips this past week oh by
the way took up all my nail polish don't
ask I just sat there and started
chipping my nail polish because my
friend Stephanie came over and she was
like telling a story and I was like
really into a story and I was just like
chipping away on my nail polish so I
have to join ales but anyway back to
this so I do think I'm still gonna
really like this once I use it
differently I want my lips to be
hydrating and I want to put on a lip
liner because I mean look at it I think
the color has stayed there pretty nicely
color is still like on my mouth and it's
been nine hours sure has faded off the
inside but I've been eating all day
color wise I think it's lasted pretty
well but now let's go into what I feel
about this told you guys at the three
hour mark that I liked how it looked it
was looking fine only I felt like it was
kind of breaking me out I definitely see
my skin bumpy underneath and besides
that it did not end well I mean it was
going strong for the first three hours
and then after the fourth hour took a
wrong turn and now we are here the area
here on my nose looks cakey the in
between my brows that looks cakey and
has faded off on my chin and nose but I
mean that's not that's not too bad it's
been 9 hours I mean how stay it on my
face pretty well like I'm not gonna lie
look my bronzer is still there that's
pretty epic it's been 9 hours I think it
does last a long time but it just
doesn't look good in this area so a
little too makeup be for me and I'm
afraid it's breaking me out and also my
friend Stephanie came over like I told
you guys and we were sitting outside and
she was kind of like looking at my face
and she was like what foundation are you
wearing and I was like why do you hate
it and she was like yeah which is why I
love asking her makeup stuff because
she's always very honest about it and
yeah when somebody tells you that you're
like
oh great so I mean even Stephanie
noticed that I was looking a little bit
kinky so yeah guys this foundation isn't
my favorite but it was so affordable so
it's like I don't know but yeah those
are my thoughts on those two products I
hope you enjoyed this like two for one
