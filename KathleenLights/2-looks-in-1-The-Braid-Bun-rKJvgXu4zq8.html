favorite braid bun hairstyles I wear
these all the time it's kind of my
favorite way of incorporating a braid
into a regular everyday bun and a more
sophisticated classy bun and one of them
is really easy and the other one takes a
little bit more time but I hope you
enjoy it and I'll just go ahead and get
into it okay so for the first hairstyle
you're gonna need a couple of bobby pins
I just picked up some brown ones because
they match my hair color more than the
black ones and you're gonna want to go
for the ones that match your hair color
the most because you're gonna be putting
in quite a few in and you're also gonna
need just a little rubber band like this
clear black it doesn't matter this gets
hidden anyway and two scrunchies and it
doesn't matter what color these are
again because these get hidden as well
and one of these sock bun things will
the socks you would use for a sock bun
and I didn't realize that I made it
white when I recruit should have made it
like brown or any color that would match
my hair a little bit better you're gonna
want to make sure that it does match
your hair color as close as possible
because just in case throughout the day
your hair kind of moves and it shows
this shows through at least it kind of
matches your hair so yeah that's what
you need for the first hairstyle and I'm
just gonna go ahead and jump right into
it
okay so I've already picked up my hair
you just want to pick it up in a high
ponytail it doesn't really matter it can
be all the way up here it can be in the
middle with this it doesn't matter it's
all about your preference so that's what
you want to do I didn't record myself
doing that because I figured you know
how to pick up your hair already so
that's what you want to do now you want
to take your sock and you're just gonna
put it through like this like if it was
a scrunchie another big fat 90s
scrunchie now the next part is a little
bit tricky
you just kind of have to feel for
yourself so you want to just lean your
head forward and kind of wrap hair
around the whole trendy oh the whole
stock knots aren't you and you just kind
of want to feel where the sock is
peeking through and you just add some
hair to it so this part takes a little
bit of time but it's not hard okay so
once you feel like you have the entire
bun covered the entire stock covered
just take your other strategy and just
softly put it over and kind of tuck it
in so yeah this is what you're left with
is now you have a long hair like me and
you've got all this stuff going on
you're gonna want to just put it all to
the back and kind of have it just
hanging there for a second okay now I
know my hair is a little bit crazy here
on the bottom but you can just add
hairspray at the very end don't worry
about that anyway okay so this next step
um really depends on your hair type and
your hair length if you can achieve this
or not before I got my hair cut in two
layers I used to have I used to do this
super easy with just no trouble at all
and it came out perfect but since I have
layers in my hair it is a little bit
difficult but it doesn't mean it's not
achievable you can do it as long as you
got a crap ton of these things so what
you want to do is take your hair right
here and then just braid it like if it
was a regular braid but make it as tight
as you can
so once you have that braided I have my
layers kind of sticking out don't worry
about that you're going to take a little
rubber band like this and secure your
braid now the next thing you're gonna do
is just wrap it around your bun so just
take it hold your bun in place and just
take it and wrap your bun around it and
then you're just gonna secure the end
with a bobby pin or with a couple of
bobby pin
now once you've secured your ponytail
braid thing in place you're gonna kind
of want to look at your braid and see if
you have any hairs like flyaways just
coming out and then you're going to
secure those and just kind of perfect
the brain how you want to perfect so I
have to give added all your bobby pins
in the places where you think they need
to go you can just add some hairspray to
the flyaways and - you know hair little
hairs falling like this and just to keep
it in place but I'm not gonna add some
hairspray now because I'm gonna go ahead
and show you a different button
hairstyle and I don't want to have
hairspray in my hair but yeah you're
left with this and I think it's so cute
let me just turn it for you and I wore
this on Christmas Eve I think it was and
I also wore this for my nephew's
birthday party and I got a lot of
compliments so yeah that's the first
braid bun and now we're gonna move on to
the second braid button so the next one
is definitely a lot easier than the
first one it's not as like classy and
sophisticated as the whole sucking the
hair thing it literally takes five
seconds and I know you're gonna watch it
and be like really like why would you
show that that's not that cute but it is
because my husband's cousin word on
Christmas and I was like oh my god your
hair looks so cute and simple and she's
like I know and it took me five seconds
and I love doing that ever since and it
really just amped up a regular bun and
it goes from looking okay to looking
cute so I'm gonna show you how to
achieve that so what you're gonna need
for this hairstyle is just a couple of
bobby pins a hair tie and one of these
tiny little rubber band things and what
you're gonna do is just pick up your
hair into a high ponytail like we did
the first time okay so I did pick up my
a little bit higher than I did with the
first bun because I do like to have this
one a little bit higher so what you're
gonna do now is just braid your hair
like a regular braid and again depending
on your layers and stuff like that and
the length of your hair it's really
gonna determine the outcome of this look
you're also gonna want to do it as tight
as possible the tighter you do your
braid also kind of keeps your flyaways
in place so if it's not so loose your
layers won't come out well won't come
out as easily okay so after you've added
the elastic what you're gonna do is wrap
it around like if we were wrapping it
around the soft in the previous tutorial
but we don't have a sock to wrap it
around
so what you're gonna do is hold this
flat so that it doesn't come up and kind
of wrap your braid around it by keeping
your hand down on that thing because if
you don't put your hand on it it's gonna
look like I'll show you it's gonna have
this like triangle look and that's not
cute so you're gonna put your hand
and then take this little piece and
secure it with a bobby pin
so after you've done that again you just
want a hairspray because yeah well I
have these little hairs that are always
coming out these baby hairs and that's
not cute so yeah when you're done with
that obviously this look isn't as
elegant and nice as the other one but
it's still a fun bun and it takes five
seconds to do
and it looks like you put a lot more
work into something that you didn't okay
guys so that's it those are my two
favorite ways to incorporate braids in
my buttons and I hope you enjoyed this
I'm sorry if this tutorial was a little
bit all over the place and kind of hard
to see my hair this is the first time I
felt my hair tutorial so it was kind of
awkward to film that I hope this wasn't
awful I'll try my best to get better at
these hair tutorial things so please
