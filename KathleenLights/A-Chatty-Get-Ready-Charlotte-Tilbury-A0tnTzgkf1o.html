a different kind of video I don't know
what I'm doing I'm sorry but I decided
to do kind of like a chit chat get ready
with me kind of video but I'm gonna
change up the name we're going to call
it my chatty get Reddy's so whenever I
never do videos like this if I'm doing
it get ready with me it's like
fast-forward and I'm not talking or I'm
just doing a tutorial I never like I do
talk to the tutorial sometimes but I
don't sit here and just talk to you guys
while I put on my makeup I never do that
so I thought maybe if I get some good
feedback on this video then okay then
I'll keep doing them then I'll keep
doing them I'm gonna call them like a
chatty get ready so it's not like chit
chat get ready with me you know I think
that's a long name I don't know maybe
whatever but we're just gonna go with it
so I have no makeup on clearly I just
have my eyebrows fill then that takes me
forever so I always do that off camera
but I recently got this books in the
mail from Charlotte Tilbury why do I
feel the need to talk like this when I
talk about Charlotte Tilbury I don't
know I have absolutely terrible self tan
hands my self tan hands are so bad I'm
usually so good about my hands like they
usually come up pretty good mess up my
hands and hmm um I recently got this in
the mail from Charlotte Tilbury they
sent me a few of their products in their
golden goddess collection honestly I
almost cried when I got this in the mail
like I'm not even joking I almost cried
oh I unwrapped everything but it came
with like a little card and it was so
sweet and it was just a few of their
products I almost cried because let me
pick this up because that's giving me
anxiety
I like almost cried because I don't have
like very luxurious makeup and not like
very very luxurious companies even know
who the heck I am so I thought it was so
crazy that they sent things to live on
me just to lil me you know I thought it
was so sweet posted a picture on
Instagram and a lot of you guys were
like please do a video on
and give us your thoughts that's what
I'm doing today I have only used
literally like a couple of these
products the rest will be a first
impression so I'm going to use every
single one of these things on my face so
let's get started oh my god look at the
can you tell this wood it's gonna be so
long cuz this why don't do videos like
this cuz I'm like oh look at this and I
i spaced out so the first product I'm
going to use is the Wonder glow I've
heard really good things about this I
actually have never tried it but this is
the Wonder glow and it's like a primer
it's not like a primer primer but you
put it on before your foundation it's
supposed to give you that beautiful glow
it's like a highlight you could also put
it like on top of your foundation as
well so unless I'm just gonna put on my
whole face cuz I can never be too glowy
oh it's nice it feels like a moisturizer
if you can hear Danny throughout this
video I apologize so this stuff is no
joke you can't tell on camera but like
it's a little shimmery
it's like shimmer it's kind of like a
glitter I did a good job hydrating my
face whoa what happened I will
definitely keep you guys updated and
hydrated my face really well though and
I have dry skin so that I do like okay
so I'm just gonna put on some founder
shin I'm using my L'Oreal True Match
Lumi this is w3 just going to put a
light layer of this I don't want like
super full-on face like a cake nut cake
because this isn't cakey it's actually
pretty luminous but I don't want like a
full-on face I don't know it's probably
going to get there where whatever so I
heard that makeup geek changed their
foundation stippling brush and they made
it smaller why would they do that
okay so my foundations on and now I'm
just going to put on
concealer I'm going to use my coverfx
cream concealer cream concealer yeah I
have been really liking this especially
for under my eyes it does crease but if
I set it it doesn't this is like really
really like good coverage like it covers
like a mofo though I've been using this
on days where like my circles pretty bad
you have to be careful how much you put
like definitely less is more with this
guy holy crap the Sun just got so bright
um I can't see I'm also going to take
some on my eyelids just to cover up them
veins okay so to set that I'm going to
use my Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35
and I'm just using an O
does an elf blush brush and I'm using to
set that
and then I'm going to set my eyelids as
well
I have to set that concealer fast
because it creases fast but the coverage
is just so good okay so now to my
favorite part I actually have used this
like once and it is so freaking good
this is the Charlotte Tilbury don't okay
this is all Charlotte Tilbury so maybe I
don't have to say that for every product
this is the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and
I've actually been wanting this for a
while for like a while but this is like
one of those luxurious gifts that you
give like for Christmas and stuff like
that it was actually on my Christmas
wish list like for Danny to buy me and
it is a bronzer and a highlighter a
sculpt and a highlight oh I love it so
I'm going to contour with this I'm using
my zoeva luxe face paint my evil 109
brush seems a little bit intense but it
blends out really well see how well it
starts to blend I don't know if you
could tell
oh my god what is that what is that
Kathleen jeez it's like this sculpt has
like the perfect undertone it is so nice
and it can get really really intense or
it can get really soft it loves it loves
it I loves it
I swear it's like it's like perfect and
then I'm going to take just like my real
techniques and I'm just going to bronze
up a little bit more
I'll use the highlight in a second I'm
going to put on some blush first my
eyebrows are that they lit in this video
video in this video okay so the blush
I'm using is the cheap to chic a swish
and pop blusher and ecstasy I love how
in the UK this is blusher I love that
I'm going to put on some blush a simple
ocean blusher and this is ecstasy area
decide that it's a really pretty warm it
has like a circle in the middle and then
like another ring around it and this one
is a little bit more pink and the ring
around it is a little bit more like warm
I'm just going to swirl it all together
pop off the wrist and apply it now that
I look at it that wonder glow really did
make my foundation look like even glowy
er can you tell I have no highlight on
my foundation looks pretty glowy I mean
it is the true Match Lumi
so that's glowy this blush is beautiful
it's like a really pretty warm pink it's
not like a peachy is not shimmery it has
like a nice natural finish it's not
powdery it's not like Mac oh and I love
the packaging it's very vintage it
reminds me of something like my
great-grandmother used or something very
vintage and beautiful of I'm obsessed
with this packaging I'm okay now I'm
going to put on some highlights this is
the sculpting glow I mean bronze &amp;amp; Glow
same thing I used before and I'm just
going to take my ELF brush again and dab
it into the highlight tap it off and
apply life oh my gosh oh my gosh
I love highlight I go overboard clearly
this is too much but yet I keep putting
it on oh my gosh is that you Jennifer
Lopez oh no that's just Kathleen Wow
okay so I am gonna put on some
eyeshadows this they sent me one little
quad it's called the golden goddess
luxury palette in oh it's just called
the golden goddess it has really pretty
let me zoom you in has really pretty
earth tones in this so I will be using
this I'm going to use my makeup geek
small crease brush I actually use this
more of a pencil as a pencil brush and
I'm going to zip it into this shimmery
champagne gold color and I'm going to
use this as my highlight my kind of
color I'm going to take my morphe m4 for
one and I'm going to dip it into this
color right here this one I'm just gonna
dust that in my crease I'm also going to
take that same color on a different
brush for some strange reason this is an
elf blending brush and I'm just gonna
pack that on the outer part right like
that and then just drag it in
I'm also going to take that same pencil
brush and run that underneath
I'm going to take this color right here
don't really know how to explain this
it's like a silver but in like a warm
kind of way it's a very natural color
just going to put that then I'm going to
use the glittery one on top this color
is like pure glitter I don't know if you
can tell can you see that
like how glittery it made my eyes that's
really cool I definitely recommend using
fix+ with this eyeshadow because I kind
of have trouble with it I'm like trying
to build the glitter on my lid and I
really have to build it but my fix+ is
all the way on the other side of the
room so don't feel like getting it but
this glitter is really cool and actually
it doesn't have fallout for it being
glitter yeah so I'm just going to go
back in with the brown and apply some
more this quad isn't my favorite I've
never tried any of the other Charlotte
Tilbury quads so those may be better
I like the colors in it but um I wasn't
like blown away with the eyeshadows this
one's beautiful and this one is
beautiful these two I think they're okay
the glitter is actually really cool but
it's not like woah you need to buy this
right now I don't feel that way I feel
that way about this not so much this
okay so I'm just going to put on some
eyeliner this is the classic eye powder
pencil in a dinner
does this not have a color or is just
called the classic eye powder pencil and
she only has one I don't know
I'm going to line my waterline give it
more of a bronzey look ooh
ty made that smoky real quick this um
this pencil is a little rough because it
is a wooden you guys know how I feel by
my wooden eyeliners but it is very
pigmented so if you're into wooden
eyeliners this one's pigmented I like
that it made that pretty smoky okay so
I'm going to put on some mascara this is
the ful faste lashes 5 star mascara oh
let me curl my lashes you talking tell
these are the best eyelash curlers in
the world in the world I've tried many
they were expensive all right this was
expensive but it's worth it it's the Shu
Uemura eyelash curler worth every penny
I paid for them so it is a natural
bristle wand which are my faves what I
have feeling I'm gonna love this I'm
gonna love this
I'm feeling so this is definitely a
lengthening mascara I really love
volumizing mascaras they're my favorite
over lengthening ones but I'm going to
build this up I'm going to do two coats
and then we'll see okay so this is two
coats what do you guys think I think it
does a super good job at lengthening and
there's no cup I did two coats there's
no clumping so if you're into somebody
who likes length no clumps I actually
like this I liking this quad more and
more the more I look at it actually just
realize that I haven't even been talking
to you guys this is supposed to be like
a chit chat get ready and I'm not even
chatting I'm just getting ready I'm not
even showing I'm not even talking I
don't do these often so this one okay
this first one is boring but maybe the
rest of them will be better so anyway
I'm going to use
I lip cheat reshape and resize lip liner
in pillow talk I'm saying it pillow talk
because I've heard emiliana talk about
this a bunch of times I mean this is
like her favorite lip liner in the world
and she says pillow talk because she's
from the UK so I love the noise I'm just
gonna line my lips
that is such a pretty color yes yes so
I'm going to use this lipstick called
stoned rose stone rose look at this
pretty packaging again I got a deal I
can't do
that it that's pretty that's pretty oh
my god do you guys want to hear the
funniest story ever this make my teeth
look yellow the other day I'm sitting in
the living room with Danny am i sitting
there we're having lunch and Manny text
me you know Manny you guys know Matty I
love Manny and he texts me and I have
him under a Manny MUA because that's his
youtube name so whatever so my phone is
like next to his computer and he's like
eating and the phone my phone is right
next to his so I get a text message and
I'm like who texts me check my phone he
looks at and he's like um who the hell
is Manny mwah I lost it I lost it he
thought that I had a guy under Manny
mwah so I was cracking up so hard that I
couldn't answer him and he was staring
at me like oh my god it was if anything
I was like that's Manny my youtube
friend he's like oh okay
I was like why would I have somebody
under mom next to her name oh my god I
could not stop laughing anyway he was
looked at me dead in the face like ooh
Sat FedEx for me is that FedEx for me he
really thought that yeah it was
hilarious so this next thing this is the
last thing I have this is the Charlotte
tilt yes Charlotte Tilbury lip gloss in
Ibiza nights and I don't typically like
lip gloss and I would usually just leave
it like this I never do like lip liner
lipstick lip gloss why do it sometimes
but not all the time so it's just
ooh does shiny it's not sticky at least
I can't tell on top of this lipstick and
if I can tell probably means it's not
sticky but just adds a gloss to it I
definitely prefer it without this so
this is the finished look using all of
these Charlotte Tilbury products that
were sent to me okay so let's do a
little rundown if I had to recommend
definitely three things it
is number one it is the Charlotte
Tilbury a film star bronze &amp;amp; Glow highly
recommend this is gorgeous the packaging
everything probably the most beautiful
freaking highlight I have look at the
most beautiful island I probably have
ever seen probably have ever seen and
this bronzer has such a beautiful
undertone that you can contour with it
and bronze your face this is amazing
stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
