chatty get ready video I told you guys
in my boxycharm unboxing that I wanted
to do a video using stuff that I've
gotten in previous boxy charms previous
boxes what I'm doing today I only have
my eyebrows done because they take 16
hours and I decided that I just want to
sit here and talk to you guys I don't
know I feel like I haven't done that for
a while I'm gonna go ahead and get
started so I think I'm gonna do my face
first I never do my face first but since
a chitchat video I'm just gonna go ahead
and do it I'm going to use my Mirabella
prime primer for face this was also I
got it in my boxy charm and I actually
really really don't know why I'm
smelling it actually really really like
this primer I'm like on a primer cake
trying out so many and I like this one
because it is a silicone feeling but it
reminds me of my baby skin in the sense
that it's silicone II so it fills in
your pores a little bit but it's not a
drying formula like have you ever tried
the benefit Porefessional that went like
dries up my skin a little bit actually a
lot of it I can't really use it it's
drying on my skin but this one isn't
isn't this one is like very silky very
smooth so I'm gonna have some foundation
now and I'm a little bit self
well I'm self-tanning right now I don't
know if you can tell but anyway I'm
going to use the Laura Mercier silk
Korean foundation I really really like
this this is in bamboo beige this is
definitely when I am tan cuz cream ivory
is my shade when I'm not ten but I don't
own that because it's always sold out
I'm going to use my a cosmetics
double-ended brush I have been crazy
about this brush since I got it I like
this foundation so much because it's
just so natural um and I feel like it's
pretty hydrating I do need to use a
primer like the Mirabella one where it's
kind of silicone II because this can
sink into my pores and like make them
appear larger so as long as I use a
primer like that one I'm good
okay so once I've done that I never
noticed that the top of this bottle says
shake well I guess okay so now I'm going
to apply some concealer and I'm actually
mixing these two I'm mixing my master
conceal and my naked skin concealer from
urban decay
this one's from Maybelline oops too much
too much too much product too much too
much
I'm going to mix them on the back of my
hand and apply it like this I'm also
going to use that concealer and I'm
going to prime my eyelids this Naked
Skin one I always use concealer eyes
primer you know so I actually don't know
what I'm going to do today I honestly
would really just wanted to sit down and
talk to you guys um but I have no idea
what I'm doing
don't know it's casual day I'm going to
set everything using Mac emphasized with
that same brush Yolo girl Yolo I think I
want to do something like super or warm
are you surprised
for my eyes I'm going to use the Cairo
palette from Coastal Scents that we got
we that we got in our box to charm a
couple months ago and I'm going to start
off by applying something in my crease
I'm actually gonna use this that I got
my boxycharm that I really love this is
like I'm gonna love this in the summer
especially this is the enter pronoun
bronzer in the shade bronzer it's like
their blowtorch bronzer blowtorch zero
one bronzer I don't know but it's a
super pretty terracotta color so I'm
going to use this in my crease as a
transition shade
okay so um I'm really really really
really obsessed with arrow it's like my
favorite show right now
aside from revenge like on TV revenge
has gotten so good so good
speaking of revenge oh I don't want to
ruin anything so I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna talk about it but I want her with
Jack so bad like I can't sleep sometimes
thinking like is she gonna be with Jack
or what like is she gonna end up with
him it's frustrating but anyway do you
guys like a flash as much as arrow like
I feel like it's not even I don't know I
really like flash I do I like the show I
like that so many people from prison
break are on the show but I don't think
it's as good as arrow and everybody take
what are you talking about it's just as
good some people even say it's better
but I really do like arrow so much more
so that's really random I just want to
know what your thought is about that so
after that I'm going to take the Kairo
palette and I'm gonna dip it into this
really pretty color right here it's gold
now how this to my whole lid oh and that
is why I always do my eye makeup first
cuz mama gets fallout this is a Sophie
100 brush so I'm going to go back into
this blowtorch guy and both my crease
out some more like I said I wanted this
pretty warm this little beach house
medic palette in Cairo is so freakin
pigmented like it's really good
considering Coastal Scents is like a
cheaper brand so I'm going to take this
one with a pencil brush from makeup geek
it's the small crease brush it's a
pencil brush to me
and then I'm going to take the bronzer
and do the same thing I'm going to take
this thing my shadow brush that I used
earlier and I'm going to fit into this
dark brown and apply that really close
on the outer V or the outer portion okay
for mascara I'm using the Revlon bold
lacquer actually got this in my
boxycharm
and used it right up and then I loved it
so much that I bought it myself this is
a brand new one I really love this
mascara okay so I just got my mascara on
and I'm just gonna finish up finish off
and finish my face
I haven't had bloopers and my videos
guys recently because I try to like film
try to compose myself and film and
quickly get to my computer and edit
because I'm in the process of moving I
say this in a video I'm in the process
of moving but I am and I just want to
have content up for you guys to see I
can't wait to like settle sit down and
settle into my house or I don't know
where I'm living it like show you guys
like hey guys is my new set up this is
like my my ish right now this is what's
going down and just relax get back to
normal and like film great videos yeah
I'm ticking gula on this brush this is
also brush I love morphe but this also
brush I got in the box from it's a
morphe s9 1s 19 so I'm going to take
hoola and I'm going to contour with it
using this brush I know it's like why
would you contour with that brush but I
just you know use it on its side and it
blends it out really nicely so feel like
I'd never use hoola and I love it and
then every time I use it I'm like man I
really like this bronzer why don't I use
it okay so now I have that done I'm not
going to use blush my hairs mess
I'm gonna take this guy I'm gonna use
this kind of like it's a warm bronzer
blush a bloody noses what you know I
mean so I'm just gonna lightly dust this
on my cheeks and this brings so much
warmth to the skin hmm like I think it's
beautiful
personally I don't think I love it I
love it it looks so scary like you look
at this enjoy whines oh I'm never gonna
wear that what but it's so pretty
especially with like warm looks like
this I love it definitely not a contour
powder but as a bronzer I think it's
gorgeous and then just a little bit of a
highlight I'm using cheeky bronze by Mac
it's a mineralized skinfinish and I'm
just not a highlight but to add a little
bit of a glow I'm just gonna throw it on
top just mix it all in okay so I'm
almost done all I'm doing is my lips I'm
going to use this beauty for real a nude
lip liner that I got in the Box recently
in my boxycharm
and I hate wooden lip liners like this
but the color is so nice that it I
really like it I mean I like it because
it's like my lips a little bit deeper
and then on top of that I'm using this
Terina Tarantino conditioning lip Sheen
in show room this is gonna lighten up
the color a little actually no no no I
think I want something more pink like
pink elephant from Trina Tarantino
I love how Gold's like this look paired
with a pink lip I swear I will marry
these lip Sheen's
I use them all the time in our person I
take them to travel with me like
constantly I love these so glossy and
moisturizing I really like this look I
was just sitting here I want to talk to
you guys and play around with things
that I've gotten in my past boxycharm
