a chatty get ready I don't know why I'm
out of breath I feel so down in the
dumps huh
you know what I'll be right back I'm
gonna go get some coffee cuz it's early
in the morning I don't got a watch but
I'm gonna go get some coffee
alright alrighty then uh coffee that
really is not good for you I didn't know
exactly what to title this or what to do
all I know is that I have a few new
Natasha de Nonna products that I want to
share with you guys today and show you
guys on camera I've had a couple of
these things like I only have a few
Natasha - no nothing's well a lot of
these things are Natasha de Nonna but
I've had these products for like two
weeks now and I want to share them with
you because some of them are really
amazing for today's video I just want to
do like really glowy skin something
really simple with a bold ish lip like a
very summery lip today my eyebrows were
not we're not my friends today I was
like come on girls you can do it and
they were just like no we're gonna be
really patchy and uneven so how are you
guys it's the morning and I just feel
like chatting with you guys I don't know
a lot of you guys told me that you
prefer like chatty tutorials and I
prefer voiceovers but I'm gonna mix and
match them and do both okay so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
prime my face I'm going to do my face
first cuz I'm not doing much on the eyes
so I'm going to use my Maybelline Baby
skin instant pore eraser
I forgot to what my beauty blender hmm
can you guys tell this is a new beauty
blender look how pretty it is it's like
neon I wished it would stay like that
forever I'm gonna pick up my hair and
like a little button just for the sake
of my foundation process so the
foundation I'm going to be using today
is the natasha de Nonna
face glow foundation this is SPF 15 and
I'm really sad that I can't tell you
what shade I'm in because by the way the
natasha 'not the natasha de Nonna
products were sent to me of course you
guys know I'm always honest with you
they were sent to me I've been hearing a
lot of buzz about this brand and when
they sent this to me they sent me two of
them but the numbering was on the actual
box and I threw it away
not knowing that the number wasn't on
the packaging so packaging you get a
point to take it away for that because I
can't tell you what color I'm in thanks
that's hot shop but anyway I love the
fact that this is in a pump so I'm just
going to pump some out on the back of my
hand this is a very thick foundation
like it's not liquidy I mean you can see
it's running down my hand but it's not
super liquidy I have to say I love the
scent of this which is really weird I
usually I'm not a fan of the way that
foundations smell not that I hate them
but foundations just smell like
foundation this smells like buttercream
it smells like foundation but then it
has like a buttercream scent I don't
know I like the scent I like the scent
so anyway I was kind of doing some
research like once once they sent me the
products I was just like on the website
doing some research and this is a very
like expensive brand it's not like why a
seller D or anything but it's up there
its high-end um and Natasha de Nona is
actually like a world-renowned makeup
artist who started her own makeup line
which is awesome I didn't know that i
have used this foundation already for
like about a week and i love it
I do love this foundation it's super
glowy you'll see I highly recommend this
for a dry skin I don't exactly know how
you would like this if you have oily
skin to be honest the coverage I would
say is medium ish and I have applied
this with a brush before and I don't
like how it applies with a brush I
definitely like the the look it has with
a Beauty Blender okay so this is the
foundation on my skin you can tell that
my skin kind of still peeks through like
you can see a little bit of my redness
and it just looks really dewy and fresh
I do love the finish it definitely is
tacky to the touch I can I don't feel it
on my face but I touch my face and I can
feel it it's tacky it's like dewy so
it's Becky so I don't like that about
this but all I have to do is set it and
that feeling goes away so I am going to
set that but I'm going to go ahead and
move on to concealer I'm going to use my
Maybelline fit me just to keep with the
dewy theme I really love how hydrating
this concealer is and how it looks
underneath my eyes I gave myself a
mustache that was an accident I just
caught up I know I'm super late but I
just caught up with how to get away with
murder
and then I made Danny watch it with me
because I was done with the entire
season and I was like you have to watch
the show you will love this show it's
amazing you'll never guess who the
killer is at the I'm not going to spoil
anything but I was like you'll never
guess what the killer is you have to
watch it so Danny was like okay fine and
we sat there and he saw the whole season
in two days and he really liked it he
does not like as much as I do I like
love it but he does like it and he
didn't guess the killer and most of the
time most of the time he's always right
like he can guess a killer before a
movie ends like he's really good with
that but this one he was like wow he was
shocked he he didn't get he didn't see
that coming
okay so I am gonna set underneath my
eyes a little bit for now and I'm only
going to keep it right under my eyes
just so that my concealer does not
crease but I am gonna set the rest of my
face in a little while because I am
going to add a cream highlight so I
don't want to set my whole face so I'm
using the Natasha de Nona invisible HD
powder I like this because it's not
translucent this isn't a shade
light/medium made in Italy I mean in
Italy huh look the better right no I
took Italian for three years and I could
understand it but I cannot speak it I
love the packaging on this because it is
a sifter like a sift you just move this
and then the product comes out so it's
not messy whatsoever he's my eyes just
to avoid creasing and then I'm going to
set my eyelids because it's already
starting to crease just so that it does
not crease okay so now I'm going to
quickly add a cream highlight to my face
I'm going to use the Real Techniques
essential foundation brush I used to
have no use for this like I hated this
brush I just kept it with my Real
Techniques collection but now I love it
for cream highlighting but yeah I found
a use for it so I'm taking the Natasha -
Nonna glow face glow cream shimmer comes
like this you could just like put on
your face but I'm not gonna do that just
gonna put it on my brush it's a really
pretty gold I'm only adding a little bit
of this because I love the highlight I'm
going to use on my face and a little bit
so I don't want it to alter the color
that much I just want to show you how
gorgeous this is - so you just added a
little bit of Korean highlight just a
smidge just a smidge and now I'm going
to set my entire face using that same
Natasha de Nona face face powder with a
big this is a zueva 101 brush I'm gonna
swirl it and just set everything just to
take the tackiness away because products
tend to skip and not look really good if
you have a tacky foundation you always
want to set your foundation if it is
tacky but it goes away with powder
this powder it this powder is really
nice but to me nothing compares to my
Charlotte Tilbury powder so chances are
that I would be using that one over this
one for sure I just have never found
anything better than that I just
scratched I had an itch in between my
eyebrows and I just scratched the
foundation off beautiful so anyway I
would say that this powder is good but
it's not my absolute favorite I
definitely prefer the face glow
foundation over this powder but again I
have dry skin so this is expensive too
and I would skip on it I'm just being
completely honest with you guys but I do
really like this face glow okay so now I
am just going to add some contour to my
face
I'm going to use my contour brush by
Real Techniques I've been like on a real
techniques kick I really love it and I'm
going to use the natascha - Nona contour
sculpting powder in light some nice
color are really pretty undertone I
really really love this contour powder
because it's really great for fair skin
really nice for fair skin the undertone
is pretty I'm going to use a different
brush because I don't really want to
contour I just want to bronze a little
bit so I just love how it looks on fair
skin this color light I like it so I am
gonna run some of this in my eye socket
this is a luxe II brush tapered blending
in about the center nipsey bag I'm just
gonna add this to the crease of my eyes
I'm going really natural on my eyes by
the way I have gotten a little bit of
nut complaints that's not complaints
constructive criticism because I don't
like to say that people complain to me
because my subscribers don't complain
get to the point I have gotten like
constructive criticism telling me that I
do like very similar looks all the time
or that my looks are just so easy and
basic and boring and guys I'm easy I'm
basic and I'm boring I'm not going to
stay here and do a full elaborate crazy
tutorial with double false lashes and a
double wing and
the inland like release muna sculpted
and I'm just I'm not that kind of girl
and sometimes I like to do like more
dramatic tutorials I've done a couple
recently I think maybe but I like to do
makeup more for the average everyday
person like I don't know what maybe
that's stupid and maybe people don't
like that about me but I like to do
things that people can create really
easily just things that people who
aren't makeup artists can do you know
like not everybody can do a wing you
know that's not the easiest thing to do
like what do you think do you think my
looks are just kind of boring and like
um too natural feel like that powder
didn't really set my concealer very well
I can't say that I'm a huge this is in a
first impressions video but I hadn't i
had only used this powder once I can't
say that I'm crazy about it I can't I
have to try it a couple times more of us
well my favorite do love this glow this
freaking gold highlight dude I freaking
love this it's so gorgeous
okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and
finish like my eye makeup I might as
well I'm already here I'm sorry that I'm
not zoomed in but I feel like I'm really
doing nothing to my eyes let me zoom in
a little there's really I'm just like
not doing anything so I'm gonna take the
Milani Bella eyes powder eye shadow this
is in Bella sand and I'm gonna apply
this to my entire lid I just wanted like
a flush of like a soft color so that's
why I'm using this it's one of those
eyeshadows that I love for like an
everyday crap I really don't want to do
anything I just throw this on my eye and
give my eye a little song song alright
my mascara is the Maybelline lash
sensational I am going to apply I'm
going to curl my lashes actually I'm
gonna apply this to my top and bottom
lashes by the way I don't have it to
share with you guys but I heard that the
Natasha de Nonna our shadow palette is
like amazing the one with the five eye
shadows my friend Laura from mrs. Lowell
in raves about it she says
excuse me hold up that better right here
for me bags no you're not okay bye
I've also seen Jamie from Jamie page
Beauty rave about it and she purchased
it herself as well so my friend Laura so
I know they're good I hear that they all
have like the quality of makeup Harbor
artist eye shadows they're very
expensive so I want to buy like the five
pan eyeshadow palette I want to get it
so bad so I will buy it because I hear
it's phenomenal and then I'll let you
guys know take my hair out alright so
I'm going to go ahead and add Blish I'm
going to use the a Natasha the Nona
blush thingy it's a duo and I'm going to
use this peachy color this is in the
shade 2 2 and with the multitask brush I
kind of used it for bronzer I'm just
going to add some blush with that I'm
going to add just a touch of the pink to
touch that added just a little bit of
color these blushes are a little bit
powdery they're not my favorite formula
of blushes if I'm gonna be honest with
you guys I'm just trying to be as honest
as possible I don't want people to think
that just because I got it for free
means that I'm going to say nice things
I didn't even have to film a video like
they just send it to me for
consideration like here try out our
products I didn't have to film a video
on it I just wanted to use them in a
video
yeah the blush is not my favorite I love
the color but it's a little powdery okay
so now for the best product ever I love
it just as much as this and just as much
as this this is the actually no I love
it more than everything this is the best
Natasha's in ona product icing all over
face and body shimmer powder this is the
shade light they have another one that's
much darker I have come to the
realization that these kinds of colors
just look better on my skintone
I'm going to use the same setting brush
I used and I'm just going to pack this
everywhere well not everywhere just on
the tops of my cheekbones watch the
magic watch the magic
like my cheeks look wet like they look
what okay and then that completes my
face just really glowy and natural as
per usual say what you want I'm boring
for my lips I do want to go with
something a little bit bold I'm using
the LA girl flat finished pigment gloss
in instinct this is one of my favorite
ones this is essentially a liquid
lipstick okay that completes this look I
hope you enjoyed this chatty get ready I
wasn't even chatting I feel so bad okay
I'm gonna try to improve my chatty get
ready but anyway thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
