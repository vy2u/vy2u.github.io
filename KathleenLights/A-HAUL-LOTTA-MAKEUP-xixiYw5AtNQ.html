a very very big haul like very very big
probably the biggest haul I've ever done
ever ever ever in my life now before you
judge you once you start to judge me
listen to me for one second I know I
really honestly just recently did the
Sephora vib sale haul and I spent like
so much money on the sale but like for
the past two weeks I've really been
hanging out with my family going to the
mall with my sister my mom Stephanie my
friend Stephanie and I've just been
surrounded by so much makeup and I can't
help myself
and then when I went to go is in my dad
he actually had two Visa gift card
this is so weird we had two Visa gift
cards that were gifted to him and my dad
was super old-school he was like here I
don't want these gave them to me so like
my dad's Visa gift cards he was a kid go
buy yourself some makeup and that paid
for like 60% of this stuff I asked you
guys on Twitter if you don't follow me
on twitter follow me on Twitter I asked
you guys on Twitter do you guys want me
to split this haul up into two parts
because I have so many things or do you
just want one big haul and 98% of you
there's only like four people who told
me to split it up like hundreds of you
guys told me one long video so I'm here
to give you guys one long video this
video is going to be hella long grab
popcorn because he's getting into it I'm
going to try to speed through this as
much as I can this is a drugstore and a
high-end haul I'm going to start with
the high end products and then work my
way to the drugstore these first two
products I want to get them out of the
way really quick because I didn't buy
these but I wanted to show them to you
so while I was on my dad's house style
haul actually sent me a package to my
dad's house with like a little gift and
they sent me the Smashbox double double
deborah experience your palette and the
smash pop and the Smashbox primer water
now if you are a watcher of my channel
you guys
know that I kind of like was topping
crap about this product a little bit
thought of you guys asked me if I had it
and I said no cuz I thought it was just
like fancy water and I didn't want to
waste my money on it but since style
Hall sent it to me I'm gonna be testing
it out maybe it is as good as everybody
says I tried it today and I still think
it's fancy water so I'm going to talk
about the things I got at Sephora I
picked up a lava Nilla pure vanilla mini
do doooo this is just like the healthy
Dior Durand I have been reading crazy
things about deodorant and how it's not
very good for you like normal deodorant
so I wanted to try this out this just
comes with two mini ones this is that
vanilla scent and I don't know if this
is gonna work for me it's 100% natural
nourishing no parabens no aluminum give
me a comment down below if you've tried
this and it actually masks some sort of
Bo or maybe I'll only use it on days
where I'm home um not when I'm like work
it out or anything I recently got this
bite Beauty five night fix for lips a
two-step system for flawless lips
there's actually a backup because I
recently purchased this earlier in the
month and I loved it so much that I
picked up a backup the other one I have
is sitting on my nightstand right now
it's basically this cute little jar it's
$15 and it comes with a mini whipped
cherry exfoliant for your lips and a
mini bite Beauty agave lip mask now I
know you're thinking why did you buy a
backup of this why didn't you just get
both of these in the full size well I'll
tell you because this is amazing
but I like it in this form the full size
comes in a little pot that you have to
like scoop out and then exfoliate your
lips I like this because it's literally
like an exfoliator like this I do not
like the full size of the whip cherry
but anyway this is a great gentle
exfoliator smells like delicious
cherries and the agave lip mask is a
cult favorite like everybody loves it
and I like this for $15 I think this is
great like to travel with and it's just
so cute I love it I would highly
recommend this if you guys saw my
monthly favorites video you know the
Clinique cheek pop in nude pop is like
one of my favorite blushes right now so
I picked up another
- pop these little puppy things and I
got mine in melon top um
because I just had my eye on this one
from the beginning it's a really pretty
it's actually looks like pink on camera
but in person it's a lot more peach it's
such a pretty like peachy glow and the
formula of these um Clinique
cheek pops are like no other I swear I
love the formula okay so I'm a little
bit of shamed of myself let me help but
I have 14 lip products to share with you
at 15 I have 15 lip products that I've
purchased in the span of two weeks I
don't even know how I don't even know
how it happened but I'm going to go
ahead and talk about the lip products I
got really quickly to get them out of
the way well the high-end ones so when I
saw that Sephora posted this on their
Instagram I got really really excited
this is the bite Beauty
cream deluxe lipstick and this is a
limited edition color I got it like the
second they posted it on Instagram I
purchased it immediately I did not want
it to sell out this is in the shade zero
zero five which is a really strange
shade and this is what it looks like
it's so beautiful it's the lipstick I am
wearing on my lips right now I do have a
lip liner under and a gloss on top that
I'll share with you guys but this is the
main little lipstick I've got going on
love by beauty cannot go wrong with this
and I'm so glad I got my hands on it
since it was limited edition okay so my
favorite liquid lipsticks in the entire
world are the girl lactic one's the dose
of color ones and I love the Stila ones
as well those are my top three and cielo
came out with five new liquid lipsticks
for the summer and these are the two
that I got Rosa and venetie now Rosa
when I got in the mail was like ooh
because I ordered this
it looks first of all I love the
packaging of like the new summer
collection sound pretty like their
original was like black this is fancy I
love it this one is super pale like when
I got in the mail was like oh it reminds
me
a lot of milkshake from Anastasio and I
definitely have to mix this it's a
beautiful color if you are very very
very fair this is beautiful but anybody
who isn't fair I think this will be like
too white on the lips and then this one
is out of this world amazing I highly
highly recommend this one this is
monisha and it's such a vibrant poppy
red but it has like that coral undertone
this is the perfect the epitome of a
perfect red lipstick for the summer I
think I got this at Ulta but this is the
lorac alter-ego lip gloss I wanted to
try out some new lip glosses because
some companies came out with lip glosses
recently and I wanted to pick up a
couple so I got the alter ego lip gloss
in the shade goddess this is the lip
gloss out over that lipstick this lip
gloss is perfect everything about this
lip gloss is perfect the scent is so
delicious and even applying it to the
lips you smell it sounds like cake it's
really really glossy but it's not
sticking whatsoever Urban Decay also
came out with a range of new lips lip
glosses and I got this one in the shade
punch-drunk yes really the cardboard
packaging is cool this is the shade
punch-drunk and the packaging on these
are beautiful I love how they look
another thing I don't like about the
packaging is that the sticker is right
on the back so like my punch-drunk
sticker is like already falling off and
I like it but I don't love it I love the
color you guys know I'm into these hot
red oranges but it's very pigmented I
don't know I feel like it's too liquidy
and too like slippy and it doesn't sit
amazing on top of lipsticks so I'm gonna
try it again with like a matte lip liner
on my entire lips and then put this on
top because I don't know I don't know if
I love it I love the color but I don't
exactly know if I love the formula so I
recently heard Rosita Rosita Applebaum
talked about this lip gloss so I picked
it up cuz ah that's just kind of person
I am
this is from the Sephora brand and it is
called perfect nude these are like their
new water know if they're new but
they're like shiny glosses in perfect
nude this was actually really good it
smells really good
and it's pigmented but it's not too
pigmented like the low rock ones are
definitely more pigmented I think at
least this one is but this is the
perfect lipstick topper like the kind of
gloss you would love to pair with a new
lipstick it feels really comfortable not
sticky and these are like $14 I like it
a lot
okay so the other company that recently
came out with a bunch of lip glosses
were Anastacio Beverly Hills and I know
that so many youtubers get sent things
by Anna sauce 10 which is really great
I'm very happy for them I love that like
youtubers get sent PR stuff I think
that's kind of nice but I'm not someone
who does get honest hacia stuff so every
time I see everybody like talking about
Anasazi stuff I'm like I want that so I
recently saw like a bunch of lip swatch
videos about the lip glosses and this
one is the one that called my attention
the most so I bought it
it's dainty this lip gloss is wonderful
if you were wondering if these were
worth the hype at least this one is this
one is so worth the hike it smells
really good it smells I like a vanilla
marshmallow it smells amazing and it's
very very pigmented very very much and
you can wear this definitely by itself
and it's such a pretty everyday color
dainty so nice Oh sing with Anastacio I
bought two liquid lipsticks and okay the
anasazi liquid lipsticks are not my
favorite liquid lipsticks I don't think
they last as long as they should I mean
you give a little you get little they
aren't drying on the lips at all which a
lot of people love but in turn they
don't really last as long like vintage
smears everywhere on me I don't like
vintage at all and the color is
beautiful but I decided to give two
other ones a shot because I have just
been eyeing these I got retro coral and
the reason why I bought this one is cuz
my friend Gabby Gabby T anyway here on
YouTube she was wearing it and it looked
so beautiful against her red hair she
has beautiful red hair and it looked so
nice on her that I was like I want that
but it doesn't look as nice on me as it
looks on her but you know what her open
dream and then I got this one this is in
the shade Bambi and is so cool it's like
a very cool toned like
pinky purple love it I was actually on
the fence with this but while I was at
Macy's I was watching on my hand and the
guy who worked at benefit was like yes
girl you need that it's really good I'm
like oh I need this and he's like yes
that color is always sold out it's
poppin it's popping and I work for
benefit so if I'm telling you was poppin
that means this poppin and I was like oh
then okay sure
about it okay so I have three more
liquid lipsticks to share with you guys
it's I'm sorry it's an obsession and
every brand is coming out with liquid
lipsticks and it's like all the rage and
I cannot get enough and I don't know if
I was disappointed with these I mean I
explain now so I've got three from the
brand coloured raine and I've heard a
lot of people talking about these and
they swatch so beautifully so I picked
up three and I haven't tried these on my
lips so I don't know about the formula
but I was really interested like dying
for this color Mars but in person it's
so much more Brown than it is like on
the lips watch online I don't know if
you see the girl wearing it on her lips
on their website it's not as brown as it
is in person so I mean I still love the
color it's really pretty that one is
Mars I got this one in a vanity rain and
this is another one that I thought was
brighter because online on the girls
lips it looks like Ruby woo in a liquid
lipstick form but it is a little bit
deeper than that and then this one this
one I really was excited about and I
wasn't disappointed in the shade or
anything it's called sugar it's a
perfect beautiful like everyday nude and
I love it okay enough about the products
let's move on something from urban decay
that actually was very very very very
happy with this is the urban decay of
course afterglow ate our powder blush I
have mine in shade fetish this is the
blush I'm wearing right now I don't know
if you could tell because I packed
things on on top of it but fetish it's
so incredible like I love this blush
when I was applying it it didn't apply
too strong or too heavy I was blown away
by the formula even the color is
beautiful but
formula of this is really good I'm
definitely going to look at other one
and the packaging is perfection probably
the prettiest packaging I've ever seen
the blush in my life okay so another
thing I got at Ulta high-end wise is
this bad boy right here this is the it
cosmetics your skin but better CC plus
illumination color correcting
illuminating full coverage cream plus
anti-aging hydrating serum with SPF 50
that's a mouthful I got this because I
heard a lot of people raving about it
and I'm already a fan of the original
like CC Plus correcting cream I love
this so when I saw they came out with an
illuminating one I was like yes I want
and I'm wearing it today and a part of
me loves it and a part of me hates it
like it is very illuminating
but there's tiny tiny little specks of
glitter in this like when I put my
mirror really really close to my face I
can see tiny little specks of the later
but you can't see that far away like can
you guys see like tiny little specks
over my face probably not but it does
look nice though like it makes my skin
look great from far so just three more
things and then I will go on to the
drugstore this video is so long three
things from Mac when I was there with my
sister I got the eyeshadow in would
winked which I told myself that after
makeup geek I wouldn't buy any more Mac
eyeshadows but my friend Gaby raves
about this eyeshadow like it's going out
of style so I feel like I needed to get
it and it's a cult favorite I feel and
my kind of color and I don't know why I
didn't have it earlier it's beautiful I
love it and then I got the cream color
base in the shade shell this is what it
looks like right here I have pearl
already and I love these cream color
bases this is the highlight I'm wearing
on my cheeks and my sister and Gaby
again rave about this highlighter and I
always thought it's a pinky highlight
like how pretty could it be but no it is
ready I do have to pack it on but when I
do it's gorgeous it's beautiful I can't
believe I doubted you and then this was
an impulse buy like such an info
but I didn't need any more brushes this
is the Mac 137 and honestly morphe
brushes has a brush that looks exactly
like this in their flawless collection
so I don't know why I bought it but I
was touching it and it was so soft and
it called my name and I thought it would
be good for highlighting contour for a
light application of blush I don't know
I don't know why I bought this this
isn't technically drugstore you can't
get it at a drugstore but I want to show
it to you guys ah I got two of the la
splash liquid lipsticks one is actually
a mousse and one is just like a liquid
lipstick this the mousse one is kind of
like the Anasazi one and these are kind
of like the lime cream ones they're both
from the same brand they're just a
little bit different in formula I guess
I got ghoulish and I got charmed I
wanted to try these out because these
are cheaper alternatives to like Stila
they're like eleven dollars so these are
two colors I got and honestly when I got
them in the mail I was like well they're
very very similar I could have done with
just one of them I wanted to buy these
because I haven't heard anybody talking
about these blushes so it intrigued me I
thought are they not good these are the
NYX baked blush plus illuminator plus
bronzer and I got this one in the shade
sugar mama
and this one in general and chiffon but
I think they're really gorgeous and
swatching them they feel super silky and
really like illuminating like very glowy
blushes so I'm excited to see how they
wear on the skin I just don't hear
people talking about them I am the last
person to jump on this bandwagon but I
got the Rimmel stay matte powder in
translucent I've never owned this before
but quick quick story while I was
filming the crest video um with East
Isle collective I was there for like
seven hours and there were lights all
over me and I started to like sweat a
little bit here on my forehead and the
guy was like hey do you have a blotting
powder and I was like oh my god no I
don't know I don't because
this never happens to me since my skin
is so dry and I was like I don't have a
transparent just like blotting kind of
powder so I've heard really good things
about Rimmel stay matte so I got two
things from essence essence is so
inexpensive and you can find some hidden
gems there like this guy this is such a
hidden gem this is the essence lip liner
in the shade satin mob it's the lip
liner I'm wearing on my entire lips this
is a wooden lip liner and it feels like
a cream one this is the creaminess
wouldn't good layer I have ever used
this puts Mac wooden lip liners to shame
and then I got this blush and I honestly
just got it um to test the formula to
see if I could recommend these essence
blushes because I didn't need another
pink blush I mean really this is a
machine baby doll and when i swatched it
on my hand i was pleasantly surprised it
has like a really pretty sheen and it
doesn't feel chalky so I don't know this
could be good when I got to put on my
face first I finally found this that
hold up I have been searching high and
low for this product because Shannon
talks about it a lot chanock so this is
the Loreal brow stylist plumper
it's a mascara for your eyebrows and I
got mine in medium to dark I have it on
my eyebrows today but I feel like it
might be too dark but I didn't want to
get the one that's like too medium
because that's the one that Shannon uses
and she's like hella blonde so I thought
that that would be too light they say
that it's very comparable to the benefit
gimme brow and this is like half the
price keeps my eyebrow hairs in place
and it has the little fibers so it kind
of makes them look fuller
these next two products are not from
Ulta these are exclusive to Walmart
these are the wet and wild color icon
contouring palette I haven't wanted to
get my hands on these because I think
that the idea is just so cute or not
cute but like so nice for something from
the drug so they have two different
shades they look pretty similar like on
camera but they're different in person
this one is in due to the lychee and
this one is in caramel toffee and I'm
kind of torn whoa I'm kind of torn
because I like the highlighter in do too
and I like the contour in caramel toffee
the caramel toffee one has a really nice
like cool toned brown color and that's
what I use to contour my face today but
this part right here actually makes my
concealer look a little bit darker since
I am a lot more fair I use this matte
highlight to set my under eye concealer
and this one is just not bright enough
for me and then this one has a perfect
concealer setter because it's nice and
yellow and very brightening underneath
the eyes love it
but this bronzer is just a little bit
like too purple I don't know how to
explain it and the pattern doesn't look
like it's going to be but when I swatch
it on my hand I was like whoa that
almost looks like a matte blush like a
Mulvey Brown I don't know we're talking
about formula they are incredible this
sets my concealer so freaking
beautifully that to me it's worth buying
both of them I opened this out of the
packaging so that I can try it on today
for the first time this is the covergirl
the super sizer mascara this is brand
new and that's the mascara I'm wearing
on my eyelashes today and I actually
really like it it is not as volumizing
as I would like but I've know if you
guys can tell it's super lengthening and
I was pleasantly surprised I typically
don't like covergirl I'm a Maybelline
mascara kind of girl but this one's
pretty good last lip product for this
Holly promise this is the Wet n Wild
Fergie lipstick in the shade for G daily
can you believe I've never owned this
lipstick but I feel like it's the
epitome of the perfect drugstore nude
it's so creamy so amazing I can't
believe I haven't owned it before so I'm
so excited that I got that I bought 606
nail polishes I got three springy colors
and then three summery colors so the
springy kind of colors I got were these
guys right here I got one from the Sally
Hansen salon manicure line this is to me
the best line at the drugstore my nail
polish actually lasts a long time with
with these colors they're so good I got
I'll I like you then these two I think
these are fairly new from
see this one is blossom dandy kind of
similar to the one I'm wearing right now
only this one's more teal and this one's
like more mint and then I have this one
this is fine to me an oasis or in this
color in a previous video it's a
beautiful baby blue and three summery
colors are they hiding they're all from
Orly oddly enough this one is called
push the limit it's a vibrant coral
they're not even showing up that neon on
camera there are a lot more neon in
person push the limit this one is glow
stick stick highlighter yellow and this
one is beach cruiser I purchased this
one because I saw Nicole Guerrero
wearing it in a video and it could not
stop staring at her nail polish that is
everything I got I'm sorry that this
video is 45 minutes long but there were
so many things thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
