is crap but let's ignore that because
this video has nothing to do with
lighting
we don't need good lights I just threw
up my camera like the quickest way
possible to sit down and film this video
for you guys
my cult has had me like completely out
of breath my nose is like really really
stuffy like I'm taking medicine and I'm
getting better but I was afraid I wasn't
gonna have a video up tomorrow which is
Monday which is today when you're
watching this but I was like there's no
way that I didn't post Monday and
Wednesday and then not give them a video
Monday I don't do that quickly just sit
here and talk to you guys give you some
sort of video I do feel a lot better so
when I wake up hopefully I'll feel even
better than I do so I'm gonna film
videos tomorrow and on Tuesday I will
continue to post three times a week you
guys know I'm not changing that I will
post three times a week when I hit a
million subscribers I sat down and I
filmed the video
thanking you guys for a million
subscribers my phone keeps going off and
of course I had to do the same now
honestly I really couldn't believe it
thank you guys so much for continuing to
watch my videos and to leave me comments
and to be so supportive thank you so
much I really really appreciate it I've
said it in the past but YouTube was kind
of like a way for me to get away from
things going on in my life at the time
and it really has just helped me become
a better person the community of
subscribers here on my channel are so
nice and kind that they automatically
put me in a better mood you guys
automatically just put me in a better
mood and you're also nice and it really
just has motivated me every day to post
and record cuz it's fun for me because
you guys are so sweet so thank you so
much I cannot believe that two million
little fingers have tapped the subscribe
button and obviously I don't get like 2
million views on my videos so not
everybody's watching but this thank-you
is for those of you who are watching
those of you who wake up and watch my
videos or go to bed and right before you
go to bed you watch my videos it's nice
and I really really really really
appreciate it so I just want to say
thank you and remember to always put out
good in the world because karma exists
and just like karma bites bad people in
the ass when you are good and you give
out good things to the world you do get
good and return and don't get me wrong
bad things
two good people all the time but
kindness is contagious it really really
is but I don't have to tell you guys
that because all of you are so kind
which leads me to my next point when I
wanted to make this video thank you guys
so much for the response you gave me in
my recent cat chats video I spoke about
like my fears and I was shocked at the
overwhelming support and love I got in
that video not that I'm shocked that
anybody was supportive cuz I'm not you
you I just went on and on about how you
guys are so great but I had no idea so
many people felt the same way I don't
know anyone who has like such a fear of
life like I do so I always thought it
was just like insane and so when I
spread all those comments like I just
sat there and i cried reading the
comments because wow like I'm not alone
and don't get me wrong it sucks that so
many people feel that way because I
don't wish that on anyone even on my
worst enemy I wouldn't wish like such
fear or fear of anything because fear is
crippling and it hurts us every day so
I'm not happy that so many people relate
to me but it kind of puts me at ease
that I'm not alone on this which means
we can overcome it together which means
that we can support each other and
that's just awesome so thank you so much
for everyone who wrote such nice amazing
things and for anybody out there who's
struggling with the things I'm
struggling with I'm here for you and we
will get through this together where
there is a will there's a way
remember that it's cheesy but remember
that so yeah um the last thing I wanted
to talk to you guys about is I can't so
I got my Ipsy bag and I was just
wondering I'm opening it right now by
the way I was wondering if you guys
still want me to post these videos cuz
they do get some comments like where's
your empty bag on Maggie but then
there's a lot of people who don't like
these unboxing videos so I'm gonna share
with you what I got oh Katie's on the
cover or not the cover the the that
would be cool if Katy was on the cover I
was like this bag that'd be cool so this
is what the back looks like the only
reason I'm asking you guys is because I
know a lot of people hate and ragging
videos and to be honest I've kind of
wanted to cancel it see for a little
while just because I haven't really been
blown away
but if it is a video you guys enjoy and
it is a video you guys still want to see
leave me a comment down below because I
will continue to subscribe for it see
and I will post the videos as long as
you guys want me to if I get more
comments saying oh you know what don't
post the videos they're boring or
whatever then I won't do it but if I get
more comments saying to post it then I
will leave me your feedback down below
and like the comments so that if one
particular comment gets a lot of likes I
know what all of you guys are feeling
does that make any sense I hope so
let's do a poll down below should I post
up seabag videos or not but I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys this one so I'm
sorry the lighting sucks but the first
thing in here is the e salon perfect
ending leave-in conditioner lightweight
nourishment for all hair types let me
sell this abscissa mow everything oh my
gosh
it smells like a regular leave-in
conditioner but for some reason I had
like a flashback to my childhood I don't
know these kinds of things I do like
because it's pretty big ah it's a really
great sample size like it's a deluxe
sample and this is great to take on
trips you put it in like your little
ziploc bag and you have like a leave-in
conditioner on your own while you're on
vacation so that is really awesome the
next thing in here is actually really
really great this is the cosmetics bye
bye under-eye I got the shade oh you saw
leader I pictured a little bit bigger
this is in the shade neutral medium I
think this actually does fit me when I'm
tan but actually this is a really good
size also to travel with that is the
upside of Ipsy that you can use these
products to travel with because they are
smaller and that is a really great bread
I love it cosmetics it's one of my
favorite high-end brands for sure and
then I got three more products in the
bag this is the model co lip lacquer see
what it looks like oh so cute it's like
a red color shall I put it on oh my gosh
this smells so good
again another flashback too much high of
hood like a lip smacker it's not too
sticky but it's like a really pretty
shiny formula and then they threw in
this crown brush right here this is good
to like highlight your inner corners
right here
it's just
a good basic brush I guess smudge things
out this is very useful that's good I
don't mind that at all and then the last
thing is in Oprah eyeliner in the shade
green go I don't typically love wooden
eyeliners but this is a really pretty
like mossy green color okay so that was
everything I go in my Ipsy bag I know
this was like random this wasn't like a
traditional FC bag and bagging but it
was already really late in the month I
didn't know if anybody really wanted to
see it but some people did so I'm super
confusing the whole FC thing again let
me know down below and again thank you
so much for 2 million subscribers it
means more than you know thank you for
watching and thank you so much for your
support throughout everything I love you
guys umm yeah please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
