tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's actually more or less the look
I was wearing in my skin care and hair
care favourites of 2017 I had this like
peachy bronze II um halo eye and I got
quite a few comments from you guys
asking me to do a tutorial on it so that
is what I'm doing and I really want to
make it a point to do videos you want to
see on my channel so when I saw so many
comments asking for this tutorial I was
like I'm gonna do it and I'm actually
switching things up in this video I
wanted to do just a full face of
affordable makeup because the only thing
I have on my eyes is the dream Street
palette so I thought it would be cool to
use affordable makeup on the rest of my
face as well plus I'm taking it one step
further and I'm only using affordable
brushes in this video I know the title
says drugstore brushes but there is one
more free brush it's an eye brush and
you cannot get that at the drugstore but
it is still a very affordable brush so
lots of affordable goodies in this video
I freaking love all the products I used
on my face today I actually tried out
this foundation for the very first time
in this video I mix it with one of my
all-time faves and I am obsessed with
this combo I'm not sure how this is on
its own this color is a little bit too
light for me but mixed with this it's
like a match made in heaven but anyway I
tried to create a similar lip color to
the one I was wearing in that video but
I was wearing Kylie cosmetics exposed
liquid lipstick and then I had a lighter
liquid lipstick right in the center from
dose of colors but honestly I look to do
all of my liquid lipsticks I don't have
a dupe for Kylie exposed from the
drugstore at least so I did some sort of
cocktail and I came up with something
kind of similar actually like the look I
created today more than the look I was
wearing in that video even though it's
similar I just feel like it looks better
today but anywho I am wrestling a lot in
this video I'm sorry but if you want to
see how to get this really easy makeup
tutorial and then just keep watching so
I'm gonna start off the look by priming
my eyelids I'm going to take the color
pop nofilter concealer but I'm using the
state I'm using the shade medium this
time cuz it's just a little bit darker
and that's what I was going for and now
I'm gonna go in
to my dream Street palette and I'm gonna
take the shade magical and this is going
to be my crease color I'm pretty much
putting this all over my crease all up
in here all over the place and I am
taking my time with this shade because
I'm playing a lot of it I go back and
forth with this shade over and over and
over again
to really build up the color because I
wanted it to be very very peachy and
like very pigmented so I did build it up
quite a bit now I'm gonna start creating
that halo eye I don't want to put any
eyeshadow in the center of my lid so I'm
just focusing this on the inner corners
of my eyes the crease and the outer
corners of my eyes I mean you see what
I'm doing but I'm taking that shooting
star shade and I'm just focusing this
right on the outer corners dragging it
into my crease and popping that on on my
inner corners as well just basically
avoiding the middle like I've already
said but I'm not being as messy with
this shade I'm being a little bit more
precise and keeping this directly in the
crease I'm gonna go back into magical
and I'm just gonna buff out the edges
just so that everything is nice and
blended
and I'm going back into shooting star
and I'm just doing the exact same thing
just building up these shades now I'm
gonna take the NYX pigment primer this
is brand new I just recently purchased
this and I'm popping this right in the
center of the lid and this kind of takes
off your eyeshadow underneath but that's
okay because you're gonna apply a
pigment or an eyeshadow right on top so
it's fine and I took the shade sweet
dreams and I'm just popping that right
in the center of the lid creating that
halo eye look and I really like this
pigment primer it works very well and
now I'm gonna take the shade Moony and
I'm using this to highlight my brow bone
and what's new going back into shooting
star I am just blending out the edges of
sweet dreams making sure nothing looks
too harsh and I'm just you know
retouching up I feel like I am the worst
at explaining my tutorials I'm like
really awful oh I forgot to do this
while I was highlighting my brow bone
but I took a little bit of Mooney and
I'm just popping this on the center of
my lid with a big fluffy brush I don't
want to use a more precise brush because
then that's really gonna pack on the
shade and I only wanted just a light
wash of this on top of sweet dreams then
I took just a little bit of the Alpha
shade and I'm popping this on my inner
corners and on my outer corners as well
just to deepen up the look a little bit
going back into magical and guess what
I'm doing I'm blending out some more
so then I just cleaned up any fallout I
had on my face and I moved on to the
face I'm using the Rimmel and stuff
flawless perfecting radiant primer as my
primer today
this is brand-new as well I just
purchased this and it did it feel nice
and moisturizing but I still have to
test it out a little bit more mixing two
foundations today the first one is the
Revlon Colorstay but it was just a
little bit too deep for me so I mixed it
in with the ordinary serum foundation
I've tried out the coverage foundation
but this is the first time I use least
serum foundation and I mean I am mixing
it with the Revlon one but this combo is
amazing it leaves a nice natural finish
to the skin for concealer I'm using my
crease liquid camouflage concealer in
the shade light beige
and for powder I'm actually using a
Catrice powder I haven't used before
this is the HD multi-talent powder and I
actually really really like it I was
using it to set my under eye concealer
and it made my under eyes look really
really smooth and the pores around my
nose looked almost invisible I think I
really really really like this powder
but yeah I'm just using that to set down
everywhere I put concealer and then I am
gonna finish up the eyes before yeah
well do I have to explain I mean I do
this all the time to finish up the lower
lash line I'm taking the shade magical
on a big pencil brush buffing that in
and then I went into shooting star on a
more precise brush and applied that to
my lower lash line as well and then I
went in with elfish on an even more
precise brush and I did the exact same
thing
I also added a little bit of this elfish
color on the outer corners and extended
it just a bit just add a little
something I took Moony again and I used
this to highlight my inner corners and
then for mascara I didn't want to put on
false he says I wasn't wearing falsies
in that video but I went in with my gigi
hadid and maybelline fiber mascara and I
really like this mascara first you do
the mascara then you add the fibers on
top and then you go in with the mascara
again and this gives you like insane
lashes like super intense and I actually
really really like this mascara believe
it or not so I'm just popping that onto
my lashes and then I also applied this
to my lower lash line but obviously I
didn't apply the fibers on my lower lash
line just the mascara and then the eyes
are completely done oh no the other one
I forgot this part but I applied mr.
bang eyeliner to my waterline and my
tight line this is my eyeliner from
colour-pop and now we are done with the
eyes so to finish up the face i'm going
in with two Physicians Formula butter
bronzers the first one is just the
original bronzer and I'm using this to
contour the cheeks a bit and my forehead
contour my forehead a bit as well
and then I went in with the one labeled
deep bronzer and I applied that to my
entire face it's just warm up my
complexion a little bit and do bronze up
the skin a little more
guess what blush I'm gonna use today I
swear it's really hard for me to use any
other Bush these days this is the Burt's
Bees blush and toasted cinnamon pop that
on the cheeks as usual and then for
highlight I wanted to use my Jake at
triple crown baked shadow in the shade
dulce de leche and I'm popping that on
my cheekbones this stuff is intense so
intense and so magical and so beautiful
and it's so affordable as well I know
this is technically an eyeshadow but I
use it as a highlight and it's amazing
and totally underrated
and if you want to glow forever this is
the one you need it's really good I'm
popping down my nose as well you know
all the places I usually highlight and
then to melt all these products together
I am using my Milani make it last
setting spray drenching my face
I lost my freaking little fan I gotta
get another one on Amazon my little
electric fan so I went in with a
lipliner this is the flower beauty petal
pout lip liner and this is in the shade
nude and I'm using this to line my lips
and I'm also filling in my lips with
this but just a little bit not like too
much and then I'm going in with this
Rimmel stay matte liquid lip color in
the shade mocha it's really really
pretty these are a little bit drying but
I do like this color and I'm popping
this on my entire lip and then I applied
another lighter lipstick in the center
just it's just a little bit lighter but
this is the Milani matte lipstick in
matte innocence just popping that in the
middle to create some dimension but that
completes this video guys I hope you
enjoyed it
