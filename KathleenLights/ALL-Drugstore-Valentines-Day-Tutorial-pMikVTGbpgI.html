Valentine's Day tutorial this is my
third yeah this is my third Valentine's
Day makeup tutorial and I decided to
make this one completely drugstore so
everything I'm using on the face today
you can find at the drugstore I will say
though I am using a random eyeshadows in
this look they are they are all from the
drugstore but they are pretty random so
if you want to see how to get this look
keep watching to prime my eyelids I am
using the elf eyelid primer and I'm
gonna keep this on my crease and towards
my brow bone because I'm gonna be using
a base on my eyelid and that base is the
color tattoo from Maybelline and this is
in the shade toughest taupe and I'm just
gonna apply this all over my lid all the
way up to my crease I'm gonna be taking
this mixed love in Paris palette in
Parisian chic and I'm gonna take the
lightest matte gray color and this is
gonna be my transition shade just to
blend out that toughest taupe now I'm
gonna use a blush as an eyeshadow
because ain't no shame in my game
and this is NYX mocha and this is gonna
be that really pretty pink in the crease
now I'm gonna take the wet-and-wild trio
in silent treatment and I'm gonna take
that really pretty purpley topi eyelid
color and I'm gonna put this all over my
lid I'm also gonna take that blackish
color and I'm gonna start adding this on
the outer V of my eye and bringing it
into the crease a little bit I'm gonna
go back and touch up on that later but
for now I'm gonna take my Maybelline
master drama eyeliner and I'm gonna
tight line with this and add it to my
waterline next I'm taking Jordana's
fabula nur and I'm gonna use this to
create a winged eye look and I was
completely out of the frame doing this
so we're just gonna breeze past that I'm
gonna take that black color again and do
the exact same thing I did before just
packing it onto my outer V and bringing
it into my crease a little bit
I'm gonna go back into that love and
Parris palette and take the darker matte
gray and I'm going to use this to blend
everything out and make it look nice and
seamless I'm gonna go back into that
blush and add some more pink into the
crease I just want it to look really
nice and soft and romantic since it is a
Valentine's Day story after all now I'm
going to take this Wet n Wild trio
called walking on eggshells I believe
and I'm going to take the brow bone
shade and I'm going to use this to
highlight underneath my brow bone and in
my inner tear-duct
then I'm just gonna apply some mascara
I'm using the Jordana best lash extreme
and before I finish underneath my eyes
I'm going to move on to the rest of my
face so I'm using is the baby skin
instant pore eraser to prime my face
and then I'm using my Rimmel stay matte
foundation and true ivory and I'm gonna
buff this all over my face with my Real
Techniques expert face brush
for underneath my eyes I'm going to use
the Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser in fair and I'm just gonna
add this in kind of like a triangle
shape to highlight my face as well then
I'm just gonna blend that out to set
that concealer I'm going to use this fit
me powder in 1/35 and I'm also going to
use that this set to my little t-zone
area as well then I'm gonna finish up
underneath my eyes and for that I'm just
gonna take that darker gray in the 11
Paris palette and I'm just gonna use
this to smudge underneath my lashes and
make it look nice and sultry and smoky
to browse my face I'm using the NYC Sun
and bras in sun and bronze in Montauk
bronze
and then I'm going to take a more
precise brush and I'm going to use this
to contour my face
or my blush I'm going to use that same
mauve color that I used on my eyes and
I'm just gonna lightly dust some of this
on my cheeks to highlight my face I'm
going to use the Physicians Formula
shimmer strip in Miami strip and then
for my lips I am using this revlon
colorburst lipstick in soft nude and
then I'm gonna top it off with the NYX
butter gloss in creme brulee
and then that is the end of this
drugstore Valentine's Day tutorial I
hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
