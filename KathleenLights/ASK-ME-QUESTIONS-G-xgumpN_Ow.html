absolutely no makeup on I look dead um I
woke up a couple of hours ago and I just
I look really bad I know I'm sorry and I
know you're thinking um your hat is very
cold my hat is wrinkled I was sitting in
my closet and I just found that I was
like oh my god my ass that I haven't
seen for about two years and it's fall
so it's pointless but anyway okay I'm
rambling I know it seems like I'm all
decked out and summer wear which I am
I'm wearing my bikini right now I'm bout
to head down to the pool in my building
with a friend of mine it's about a
million degrees outside man I know I
know it's fall you're like no kathleen's
fall stop but it's so hot outside and I
just I just want to go to the pool you
take advantage before it gets really
cold and since I'm from Miami I just
hate the cold weather it drives me crazy
so I'm trying to take advantage of all
the heat and Sun I can you know get but
I just wanted to film this video really
really quick cuz my friend is on her way
and I'm trying to rush through this but
I haven't had many days off from work I
usually have more days off than I did
this week but I didn't I had some extra
hours which is good so I was in a most
atomic film a video yesterday because I
worked yesterday on Sunday when I
usually don't yesterday was Sunday
Monday I don't even know what that is
anyway I wanted to do kind of like a Q&amp;amp;A
video I get a bunch of questions like
how old I am and where I'm from and
where my accent is from which by the way
I don't hear the accent but you guys do
so I wanted to do a Q&amp;amp;A for you guys
just so you guys can get to know me more
and stuff like that so that is what this
video is about I want you to leave all
your questions down below you can ask me
anything seriously
anything don't be shy nothing like
inappropriate I would assume you
wouldn't ask that but so yeah just leave
your questions down below and I will be
answering them in a video sometime next
week so yeah sorry that today wasn't a
beauty video I know you're probably
bummed about that I'm really really
sorry it's just
finally my day off and I go and I want
to go hang out at the pool for a little
while which I hope you understand so
