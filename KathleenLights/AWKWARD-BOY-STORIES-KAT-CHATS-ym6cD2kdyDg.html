this went my my super short I don't
remember
Thanks so now I have to google it my
supers are you scratching my couch I
didn't think so
I don't ha hey guys so today's video is
going to be another episode of cat chats
and drinking my Cuban coffee
very messily apparently I cannot drink
coffee like a normal person it's been
really requested to do like a how-to
Cuban coffee video and I think I'm going
to do it I think I'm gonna convince my
mom to come to my house and for us to
film like how you make Cuban coffee I
want to start off by saying please
excuse my lighting I have a huge window
here uh that was really dramatic my
window is actually not big at all I just
have a window here I'm on caffeine today
something is happening obviously you see
like the light hitting my face here and
not here my goal is to make this corner
my cat chat's corner this is my little
love seat a lot of you guys were asking
me about this I got this at Pier one a
little little pillow says good vibes but
I haven't installed my curtains yet so
that's why the light is coming through
here once I get my curtains up you know
and I could block the Sun then the
lighting should be good but welcome to
my new cat chats corner there's still a
lot of things I have to do I want to put
lights on the wall actually let me show
you well should I even show you or get
to the point of this video maybe let me
just show you I got these really cool
lights at Urban Outfitters and they're
just Firefly lights but they have little
clips on them so I'm gonna put like um
insects photos here kind of like
polaroid photos you know so I'm gonna
put lights back here with little photos
of like my friends and family and dogs
lots of dogs I actually want to do like
a little section of all the beautiful
dogs in my life my three dogs and then
Gaby's dog Lilly and then Mason the
beautiful pitbull that ace whatever
anyway I'm going off topic okay Amy if
you're watching she's the one who made
my little cat chats Corner sign I'm
still working on this corner and there's
still a lot I have to do so don't worry
so it was actually gonna film a cat's
video all about my anxiety and my OCD
because I feel
you know like it's kind of gotten worse
the past few months and I just wanted to
sit down and talk about it but I thought
for today's video I'd do something less
depressing or less sad I wanted to do
something a little bit different because
I haven't done a catch outs video in a
while since I've been in the process of
moving so today it's gonna be another
story time video basically where I tell
you guys just stories of things that
have happened to me in my life and stuff
like that but today I thought I would
focus on awkward boy stories God knows I
have a lot of those so to just give you
guys a little bit of information about
my personality in high school I didn't
put anything on my lips so I was a major
prude in high school and middle school
obviously but I was a super prude thank
you Father
but that didn't stop me from being
extremely boy-crazy I was very like I
had a crush on a different boy like
every day I was that girl in high school
who like the guy would like walk by and
I was like I love you bye and he had no
idea who hell I was yeah that was me I
was very very shy and I I mean you guys
know I ate lunch in a classroom I had my
small group of friends and I was so shy
I didn't really mingle with guys at all
ever but there was this one guy he was a
baseball player and I thought he was
like the cutest I had a thing for
basement players I would say I thought
he was like the cutest thing ever
engineer always makes fun of me whenever
she we talked about him like when we
refer to him because he would literally
talk to me and everything he said I was
like I thought everything he said was
funny when it probably wasn't I didn't
know how to act around really attractive
guys but one day of course something
happened that made me never ever look at
this guy ever again so every day after
school I would hang out in the training
room I guess they would call that I had
a really good friend of mine who was a
water girl as they like to call them
they were like the ice chicks like they
would attend to injured football players
or like if they had like a back or
something they were like football nurses
I don't know what the term was point is
they used to sell like che
and soda and all that stuff in the
training room every day after school
because they like banned soda from the
vending machines and all that so I would
go and I would hang out there after
school sometimes Jeanine would hang out
with me and I would just wait for my mom
in the training room and a lot of the
times it wasn't only football players I
would go over there it would be like
baseball players and other people that
just wanted to drink soda or like buy
potato chips you know so I had a really
big addiction to Sunkist it was on
another level my addiction to Sunkist it
was on another well I mean I had an
addiction to soda period my whole life
it actually has been a year and two
months since I've had any type of soda
at all so I'm gonna put myself in the
back there because I was highly addicted
at one point in my life especially the
Sunkist that's my story so every day
after school I would have at least one
can of Sunkist and one day I'm just
standing there drinking my Sunkist and
Peter comes into the room and he's like
having conversations with people and I'm
like nervous like sweating profusely
just because Peters in the room and he's
so ridiculously attractive I was just
nervous because of that so I kept
drinking Sunkist and I don't know why
but I felt like it was it gave me
something to do because if I wasn't
drinking Sunkist I was just kind of
standing there like watching listening
to him talk so I was on my phone
drinking Sunkist sweating a little bit
so he comes up to me and starts to have
a regular conversation with me cuz we
were like sort of friends not really but
we were sort of friends ish and I was
just nervous that he was standing that
close to me so I don't know what it was
it was my nerves it was like things were
freaking out at this point I think I had
like four Sunkist s-- back-to-back four
cans of Sunkist back to back I had never
drank that much before in my life and
whatever so I have a conversation with
him he like walks away he goes to
another part of the training room thank
God at least he walked away from me and
all of a sudden I just start to
projectile vomit Sunkist everywhere and
it was the weirdest thing but what was
coming out of my mouth
looked like a fireman trying to
to take out a fire of a building and
instead of water coming out of his hose
it was like orange liquid it was like
Sunkist that was like you're squishing
my pillow and I'm in the middle of a
story what is happening that was the
amount of pressure that the Sunkist came
out of my mouth like it looked like a
fireman hose and it was orange it was
bright orange it was a little bit
traumatizing he just kind of stirred on
me like he kind of like walked up to me
after that and he was like oh my god are
you okay like how many Sunkist did you
have if I could have taken out an
invisible notebook and wrote his name um
under the list of guys who would never
ever date me in a million years he would
be right at the top let's just say I
never spoke to him again after that oh
my god
one of the most awkward first kisses
I've ever experienced guy sorry of my
life we were sort of like talking in the
process you know we were like getting to
know each other
texting and then we went and we hung out
one day and I didn't like to go on dates
cuz I was scared so we had like a double
date kind of thing and Samantha as you
guys know Samantha we went on like a
double date which she is still with the
person that went on this double date
with us which is awesome hey Denis Lill
love you guys together get married so I
mean I had been talking to this guy for
a while my by the way our date was at
Burger King huh just thought I'd do
another Burger King ballin on a budget
you for me and after that we all went to
Samantha's house just to hang out and he
was like hey you want to walk around the
block so we went and walked around the
block and we were just talking and you
know it was really nice we kind of
stopped and we were like hanging out by
a fence and we were like leaned up
against a fence and we were just talking
and stuff and then he goes in like to
kiss me right so immediately I'm like
really really tense and okay I'm leaning
up it's just it was the weirdest
situation anyway I'm leaning up against
a fence the fence you know the fence is
behind me here and he is literally like
like this how do I give you a vision
okay this is the fence right here I'm
right here and I'm facing me I'm the guy
his name is Pablo Pablo
okay this is me this is me right this is
me pop I'm Pablo and he's like this
holding onto the fence and I'm just
leaning up against the fence and I'm
like oh my god what is about to happen
something is about to happen yes very
similar so he goes in to kiss me and I
kid you not I did one of these and I
swooped out from under his arm and I was
like oh he's doing
mmm he was just standing there like oh
okay and then we just kind of had a
staring competition for what felt like
five years and then he wasn't saying
anything so like the first thing that
came out of my mouth was just baby steps
and he was like oh okay yeah baby steps
and I was like yeah okay so like I guess
I should head back to Samantha's house
now I guess he's like yeah I guess and
that was that he then ended up date
fully dating me so props to him for not
thinking I was a idiot now this
one isn't awkward for me but I feel like
I have to tell you the story because it
was one of the funniest nights of my
life
so I had a really big crush on a
baseball player not Peter a completely
different baseball player and I only had
a crush on Peter like Peter was just
like somebody that was really attractive
that every time he was around I was just
like oh my god you're beautiful like oh
but no this guy let's call him Tom I
full-on thought I was in love with Tom
like on another level like I really
really liked Tom so turns out that for
like a brief second Tom liked me back
for like a brief second and I wouldn't
exactly say he liked me back it was more
like his ex-girlfriend kicked him to the
curb and he had nothing else to do so he
would talk to me I didn't know that at
the time Tom asks me out on a date you
know to go to the movies so of course I
call Jeanine and I'm like Jeanine
not do this by myself you have to come
with me like we have to make this a
double date we have to we have to so she
goes with I mean I cannot say his name I
can't anything I really good I'm gonna
call him Doug so she goes with Doug who
I guess they were kind of speed they
were kind of talking ish I think she
liked Doug but I don't know if it was
anything serious it was just like they
were talking and you know so Jeanine had
like really strict grandparents though
whenever we would say that we were
getting picked up by like female friends
and it wasn't female friends it was male
friends we would make them like Park
down the block and then we would run to
the car and then leave because if not
her grandparents would be like I said
man picking them up and then we wouldn't
be allowed to go and it was gonna be me
and Tom and her and Doug I was so
excited to go out with Tom and the day
before I don't exactly know what me and
Janine were doing I think we were trying
to do splits like at my house like
forcing ourselves to do splits but I
know that either but I know that I don't
actually you know what let me call her
I'm not sure if she threw up or if she
had like okay Jenny okay do you remember
that day that we went out um that we
like left your Grandpa's house and you
had like that uh reaction to your face
because we were doing something the day
before yeah okay uh what happened did
you throw up or did you like laugh or
something I don't remember I was leaning
over the bed and you start like jiggling
hairs okay and upside down and laughing
oh yeah that's right it was a laugh
thing I thought you might have thrown up
okay I was just wondering
my head and I was sitting and putting
too much
I think office me with like pressure
nice with too much as I said my face oh
yeah you should check that out
that's nothing okay that's all I wanted
to hi uh-huh no reason no why would I do
that okay so back to my story so the day
before we went on in this double date
that she was also very excited to go on
and when Janine puts a lot of pressure
onto her face she like severely breaks
out and leave me a comment down below if
that happens to any of you because I've
always found that really weird so if she
like throws up I guess like the pressure
of her barfing like will make her break
out and I'm not talking about like a
pimple no no no her whole face looks
like a rash like an intense bumpy rash
it's insane it's happened her multiple
times it's crazy so the day before she
was laughing so hard and I'm guessing
she was upside down or leaning over the
bed I don't know the things I can't
really remember or explain but the next
day her whole face was like in like this
bumpy rash she texted me so when I went
to her house she was like I'm not going
and I was like what no you are she was
like how the hell am I gonna go with my
face looking like this like dog can't
see me like this I can't so I was like I
don't know put makeup on do something so
she like packed on powder I mean the
love of a cousin because she really
didn't want to go but I had like begged
her to go and she packed on so much
powder so much powder onto her face and
at the time we did not know anything
about makeup so I'm sure it was like
probably like Mac Studio Fix powder
something super thick and she was a pag
you know trying to cover the bumps and
I'm like hey it looks great it looks
well you look fabulous I can't even see
it and the layer the layer of makeup she
had on her face was in what's unreal so
we go you know uh Tom picks us up it's
in Tom's car we like run down the blog
we get in the car you know and I was
telling Janine I'm like it's not a big
deal it's nighttime we're gonna be
watching the movie like who's gonna see
your face no one's gonna even see you
you look fine the first thing that
happens when we
get into Tom's car is dog dog is in the
backseat I get in the front seat with
Tom and Jen Ian gets in the back seat
with Doug and the first thing that
happens is don't turn her on it looks
like oh my god happens your face I was
in the front seat like I looked up a
ginning through like that little what is
this called rear view mirror I don't
drive much and she looked at me with
like these eyes of death like she was
ready to kill me I was like what deaf
like don't be rude there's nothing on
her face her face is fine you're such an
asshole like and it was just really
funny I mean for me it was funny I don't
really remember what happened much after
that piece I tried to delete all the
memories that tom is and to be honest so
I don't really remember what happened
after that but Jenny was really upset
with me for like a week speaking of Tom
okay I do have another tom story this is
the one that was like the cherry on top
this was so embarrassing okay so this is
probably like my most embarrassing
experience with a guy that I liked in my
life so like I was saying earlier I was
very into Tom like I really really liked
him and okay so well I kind of had a
crush on some guy previous to Tom as
usual I call my question they were just
literally just little crushes okay so
I'm gonna call him a douche boy now I
would talk to him every once in a while
and we went on a couple dates he would
go on a couple dates nothing really
happened I mean I think the farthest it
went is like a pop kiss on the mouth
like it was not like once a nothing
nothing was there so I know that he was
kind of friends with Tom at the time or
they had they had like some sort of
friendship I guess bla bla bla
and when I started talking to Tom like
uh it was kind of going somewhere I let
him know I was like hey just let you
know I kind of had a thing with douche
boy and it wasn't anything serious I
mean we talked for about two weeks it
was literally like a two-week thing and
it went nowhere it was not that serious
I just wanted to let him know because I
didn't want him to
I just feel like he should have known
because it was his friend and I'm a
nice human being like that and I respect
people but apparently tone didn't feel
the same and his exact words were like
oh my god
douche boy is always effing around with
girls like he never girls never take him
seriously like I'm not surprised he
tried to get with you he gets he tries
to get with everybody he's an asshole
that's a nice I was like wow
isn't that like your friend and he's
like yeah yeah he's my friend but he's
that's the kind of guy he is you know I
don't worry about that that's not a big
deal at all
literally that's how the conversation
went so we were dating for about a week
and a half me and Tom and he started
acting like kind of weird out of the
blue like random out of the blue was so
weird so we all have a friend Johnny and
we all go to his house well that's his
actual name actually my friend Johnny
who is Jennings current boyfriend by the
way not that anybody cares
but we all go to Jennings how Johnny's
house we all hang out at Johnny's house
and I invite Tom to come over and I'm
like hey you should come over we're
gonna watch a movie there was some other
guy there I'm gonna call him Phil and I
was like hey come over me Jeanine Johnny
Phil is here come over and be fun and
he's like yeah yeah for sure he was all
about it he tom is like for sure I'm
gonna be there it's gonna be so much fun
we're gonna watch a movie it's gonna be
great
and I was like uh-huh things are
starting to look up for me and Tom it's
gonna be beautiful we're gonna have a
beautiful relationship it's gonna be
awesome
Rach so wrong I've never been more wrong
so Tom calls me and he's like hey I'm
outside and I'm like cool come inside
like we're all in here it's not a big
deal he's like no I really need you to
come outside for a second and I was like
okay but then after are you like coming
inside or are you just stopping by what
what's happening he's like just come
outside I really need you to come
outside for a second and I was like all
right cool yeah totes so I go outside
and as soon as I opened the door tom is
standing right here like I open the door
and I close it behind me Janine Johnny
and Phil are inside I open the door
tom is standing right here and right
next to him right here is douche boy and
I close the door and I'm like King is
Limits what's happening what's going on
here they like pretty much cornered me
here at this point they were like so
close to me corner me douche boy looks I
mean he's like I didn't know you were
dating Tom
I'm somewhat I don't like confrontation
I do not like confrontation and not
because I'm like scared anything I just
emotionally doesn't sit well with me so
he tells me he's like I didn't know you
were dating Tom and I just looked at him
and I was like what like who the
are you
that's what I said in my mind but
outside I was like I didn't know I was
supposed to like why are you here Tom
stood there with his arms crossed
staring at me and didn't say a word and
I'm like staring at Tom like um douche
boy proceeded to rip me an asshole
he's like why would you try to get in
between a friendship he's my friend
what's wrong with you and I was like
okay um first off me and you were
nothing so I don't understand I was like
so taken back and I just remember
looking at Tom like dude I pretty sure
we had this conversation like two weeks
ago
or I told you about this and you told me
hey don't worry about it he's a
douchebag he's an asshole he's that kind
of person but I didn't say that because
I didn't want to throw Tom under the bus
because again I'm a good person
I remember just staring at Tom like in
complete disbelief then Tom begins to
say I had no idea that you dated douche
boy and my mouth dropped like my soul
left my body I was like what excuse me
when I turned around walked inside and
closed the door and I turned to Janine
and Phil and Johnny and they were like
what happened and I started to bawl my
eyes out Phil like hugged me and I was
just crying for like an hour because I
couldn't believe what had just happened
it was so embarrassing I was like
standing out there and they were like I
was humiliated it was so embarrassing
and after that I mean I never looked at
douche boy's face ever again as for Tom
like I just tried to avoid him as much
as possible after that every time he
walked into a room that I was in I
literally had to leave like it would
make me so uncomfortable but that was
probably the most embarrassing situation
that I had been in where a guy was
involved I mean like humiliated because
I have tripped in front of
guys that I liked like fall on my face
fall on my face I had embarrassing
things happen like that but where I felt
like betrayed and humiliated like what
that day actually never spoke to either
of them ever again after that oh no wait
yes I did speak to Jewish boy want to
tell him to go himself oh my god I
have a Doug story okay
let's go back to Doug so I didn't really
tell you guys much about Doug but Doug
was like my best friend in high school
we were really close in high school and
we had like a really great friendship
Doug was the type of person who I would
literally dare him to do anything and he
would do it we had like a thing in
school where I would tell Mike I dare
you to kiss that girl right now and he
would run up to that girl and kiss her
on the mouth and it was really
entertaining for me it was no I probably
wouldn't do that that's such that's so
childish but it was funny at the time
but anyway so Doug did not like Tom for
me it was like he's still hung up on his
ex girlfriend you really need to move on
from that guy
that's just not gonna happen and I was
like no you're wrong about him spoiler
alert he was not wrong about him so one
time me him and Amelia I don't exactly
remember what we were doing we were all
hanging out together the three of us and
we were in his car and we were like
driving around and me and Doug got into
a huge fight like it was about Tom we
got it's a huge fight and he was like no
like I don't want you hanging out with
that guy anymore and I don't want you
seeing that guy and I was like excuse me
like who are you my father I'm gonna
date you over the I'm gonna date i
remember in media being in the backseat
and she was just like like so awkward
and uncomfortable but me and him were
going at it like screaming at each other
whatever so I got to the point we were
like pissing each other off he literally
stopped his car in the middle of traffic
in the middle of the road he was like
get out I was like what he's like get
out of my car I was like come on Doug
like we're in the middle of traffic like
don't be silly keep driving
he was so serious about it he was like
get the F out of my car so um I was like
fine now and I got out of the car
and I remember meeting in the backseat
like um do I have to get him out of the
car I just looked at me like
just like all right yeah all right and
he's like sorry I media nothing personal
she's like no let him take it it's fine
and he like left us in the middle of the
street and then like drove off like up a
stall movie like and there were people
staring at us like hardcore staring a
bunch of there wasn't like a bunch of
old people that lived there in that
little neighborhood and they were all
just staring at us like it was so funny
thinking about it now it was really
funny like it was he stopped traffic
people were beeping because I wasn't
getting off the car I was like I'm not
getting up the car what he talking about
we're in the middle of traffic it was
just a whole show so awkward it was so
embarrassing um I didn't talk to him for
a while after that and then of course
after Tom cornered me with douche boy I
called Doug and I was like turns out you
were right that was also really awkward
even though it it was Doug and it wasn't
like another boy it was still really
embarrassing we had to walk to Emilio's
house cuz that was the closest
destination um I'm sure I have a lot
more awkward guys stories
oh speaking of car one time okay okay I
have to tell you guys a story this is
the last story about a guy I have to go

go hang on Bob we go to this lake
whatever and she's like oh look that's
him over there and he's like paddling
towards us on a paddle boat and my heart
sank when like he was getting closer and
closer and I looked at him and I'm like
meant he looks so familiar and as soon
as he gets close I my vision is pretty
bad so as soon as he gets close enough
where he's getting off of this raft or
paddle boat I look at him and my mouth
opens I'm like and my friend Elizabeth's
like Kathleen like what's wrong with you
like what are you doing what's happening
and I was just shocked he comes up to us
and he's like hey what's up I'm Bob and
he goes to like hit like shake my hand
and I couldn't even move I was like
she's like this is my friend Kathleen
she's not normally this weird I'm like
Bob it's me he's like mmm I'm like
elementary school Kathleen we were in
the same class I have pictures with you
at a Seaquarium no he's like sorry you
know and I the more I tried to explain
who I was the Dumber I sounded because
clearly this guy had no idea who the
hell I was and I was like well I knew
you in elementary school before you
moved and I'm like are you back he's
like yeah yeah we moved back a couple
years ago and I live around here this
and this and he was like so wigged out
by me and I was just like oh my god I
even text my sister and I was like Bob I
just Bob and she's like oh my god what a
small world how crazy whatever I call
Janeane I I was literally I thought it
was fate that brought us together I was
positive I was gonna marry Bob I was
like I'm gonna freakin marry Bob because
this is a story this is a this is a love
story you never you see this only on TV
he paddled his way into my life and
that's it we're gonna get married
no so wrong it was such a letdown bob
was the typical guy in high school who
thought his
OOP didn't smell you feel me he pretty
much was on the same level of douche
nice as douche boy and I was just so let
down but Bob ended up really liking me
which was very unfortunate I did not
feel the same way but I had to give it a
try I had to give it a try because I
owed it to the fifth grade Kathleen I
owed it to her I ordered her to give it
one shot so we went on a date and it was
so uncomfortable we went to a party
which I never even party anyway but we
went to a party and when we walk in it
was so funny we walked into the party
and some girl was like ah but and runs
up to him and they like embrace in this
hug and I'm just standing there like I
didn't see him for the rest of this
party he was hanging out with that girl
the whole time which not that it really
bothered me because I wasn't into him
but man dude I came here with you hello
come on
he was my ride anyway so when the party
was over I'm like hey it's like time to
go nice to meet you Cheri
hi I'm who he came with hi nice to meet
you kay bye we're leaving so when we're
in the car you know we're having a
regular conversation and he goes to drop
me off he stops right at my front door
and I'm in the car and um I go to you
know take off my seat belt and open the
door and he's like wait wait and I'm
like what what I think goes he leans in
to kiss me to kiss me all I could do
like in that moment was what the hell
are you doing and he froze he was like
ah nothing I guess and I was like yeah
hey thanks for the ride and I left and
speak to him ever again after that so

awkward for either me or him I'm gonna
say both of us we were both feeling
pretty awkward after that okay guys so
