a back-to-school makeup tutorial on the
makeup I'm wearing right now I
personally love it I think it's really
simple and pretty natural which I think
that's the kind of makeup look a lot of
people want to go for at school nobody
wants to look like Kim Kardashian at
school at least I never did but you go
on with your bad self if you do you go
on with your bad self everything I use
in this tutorial is from the drugstore
which is the best part especially if
you're in high school and you can't
afford to spend a lot of money on makeup
I think this is the tutorial for you
okay I'm gonna stop talking now if you
want to see how I got this look just
keep on watching okay so I have no
makeup on obviously the only thing I
have on my face is some moisturizer from
earlier today and I'm going to go ahead
and skip foundation since this is a
back-to-school kind of tutorial I'm
going to go very light with the makeup
but if you are someone who has
problematic skin and you're kind of like
self-conscious about it and you really
want to wear foundation wear it but I
would suggest just going in with a full
coverage concealer and just dabbing it
over the places where you have pimples
and then just kind of powder your face I
think that would be better that would be
a little bit more natural this is a
really really good concealer it is so
full coverage it's the hard candy
glamoflauge heavy duty concealer this
covers my tattoos like it's crazy so I
really like using this whenever I have
like really bad breakouts like you know
that time of the month but anyway so
yeah like I said I'm skipping foundation
I'm going to take my Maybelline fit me
concealer actually use this as
foundation all the time and just put
this all over my face and blend it out
but right now I'm just gonna dab this
over my you know like my little pimples
and around my nose I get really red
around here I love this face I make
this little people on top of my eyebrow
I was born with this like red birthmark
in the middle of my eyebrows right here
some days it's a lot more red than other
days sometimes I don't even see it it's
just really it's a weird birthmark and
then I'm just going to blend in with the
Real Techniques contour brush okay so if
you're like me you suffer from really
bad under-eye circles and as light as I
am going with my makeup
I really can't ignore that because they
drive me crazy so I'm going to add some
under-eye concealer and for that I will
be using the maybelline instant age
rewind dark circle eraser this is in the
color fair it's the lightest one that
they have and I like the concealer under
my eyes to be a little bit lighter than
my natural skin tone and this actually
creases on me and settles into my little
lines but it is a really good under-eye
concealer for the daytime like for an
everyday thing so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take my ELF eyelid
primer and put this right here because
while this helps your eyeshadows not to
crease this will also help your
concealer not to crease you actually
don't have to do that it's just that
this concealer creases on me but no big
deal so I'm just going to take some of
that and I did underneath my eyes
I'm going to take that same contour
brush I use for my concealer and that's
what I'm going to use to blend this out
okay so my concealer creases unless I
put a powder on top you don't have to
but I must
and this isn't extremely affordable this
is the mac mineralize skinfinish natural
in medium but it's the only powder I own
that doesn't cake up underneath my eyes
because everything everything takes up
on me I have really dry skin but this
doesn't so so I'm using it I'm only
going to dust it underneath my eyes okay
so that's that now I'm just going to add
a little bit of eyeshadow just because I
have a lot of veins on my eyelids and I
can look a little sick sometimes you can
just go ahead and put concealer on your
on your eyelids to like mask your veins
if you have veins like I do or you can
just add a little bit of eyeshadow I'm
going to take the weight and while
walking on eggshells trio and I'm going
to take the color come up with that for
a second and I'm going to take the color
crease right here which is just like a
goalie kind of brown and I'm going to
take it on my ELF eyeshadow brush this
is three dollars at Target and it's a
good eye shadow brush I knew I should
soo-min should not yeah Oh before I put
on my eyeshadow haha
completely forgot I'm going to take my
ELF eyelid primer this is a dollar at
Target and I'm just going to add this to
my lids you don't have to do this but if
you feel like your eyeshadow doesn't
really last or increases this is a good
product to put on your eyelids okay now
back to what I was doing before I'm just
going to take my brush dip it into that
crease color and put this on my eyelids
I'm going to take that same brush and
flip it this way and just kind of blend
it into the crease
kind of drag the eyeshadow up into the
crease
you
and then I'm going to dip the tip of my
brush and run that underneath
you can go ahead and stop there but I'm
just going to take the Bravo and shade
and underneath my brow bone and that's
all I'm going to do for my eyes and then
I'm just going to add my mascara I am
using Maybelline colossal volume Express
this mascara smells so bad and I don't
know why like I don't even know and it's
Simon like bad like garbage it's like
the weirdest scent none of my mascara
smell like this
I wonder why if you know why let me know
because I want to know okay so that is
everything I'm going to my eyes and when
it comes to my eyebrows I've always been
the type of person that said I needed to
do my eyebrows if I'm going somewhere
like I need to fill them in even if I'm
just going to wear mascara and that's it
but I mean for school no one's gonna
walk around be like did you see that
girl she didn't fill in her eyebrows it
doesn't really matter it's just school
honestly just taking a spoolie and just
combing your eyebrows makes a heck of a
difference especially if you're someone
with really full eyebrows already just
plucking them and brushing them just
makes a difference you know you don't
have to sit there and throw them in
especially if you have already
if you already have really nice full
eyebrows but if you're someone who has
like little bald spots in your eyebrows
you can just go ahead and take like a
matte eyeshadow and fill in the little
bald spots you have in your eyebrows I'm
just gonna lightly take an eyeshadow and
run this angled brush through them just
a little bit just like that nothing too
serious just as natural as possible okay
so I'm almost done sorry if this video
is a little bit long honestly when you
do this on yourself in the morning takes
five minutes but I'm just going to take
my ELF contouring blush and bronzing
powder um you don't have to put on
bronzer if you don't want to it's just I
like bronzer no matter what it's just me
but I'm just taking a little bit of the
bronzer and just bronzing my face a
little bit just to give some warmth to
my face just so I don't let you know so
you don't look like a corpse walking to
school Jeremy just bronzing my cheeks a
little bit
little bit on your nose on your chin and
that's it
I recommend skipping blush and highlight
and all that glamorous makeup because
it's a bit excessive to go to school but
you know if you want to do it go right
ahead by the way used the Real
Techniques blush brush
I love the Real Techniques brushes
especially if you're in high school
because they're cheap and they're
extremely high-quality so lastly I'm
going to add a little bit of color to my
lips and for that I'm going to use the
covergirl LipPerfection jumbo blossom in
blush twist just like a really pretty
everyday pink so
okay so that's it this is my back to
school makeup look honestly you can
change it up you can do whatever you
want you don't even have to use
eyeshadow if you don't want to if you
think that maybe I shot it was a bit too
much you can go ahead and just add some
mascara maybe just add a little bit of
eyeliner you know you do whatever you
want it's your face remember that but
regardless I hope you did like this
video anyway and let me know down below
in the comments what video you would
like to see next
oh and if you're wondering about my head
this isn't a headband this is a anyway
if you're wondering what's on my head I
got this at forever 21 and I don't know
if you guys have to wear uniform at your
high school but at my high school I know
that we did we had to wear like a red
white or blue polo so we would try to
like spice up our uniform as much as
possible by like wearing the cute little
headbands or like you know little vests
and stuff like that so I think this is
cute for school I wear anyway I'm just
going to stop talking because I could
sit here and talk forever so thank you
