another haul I know I don't I don't I
know I've been hauling non-stop on my
channel but I promise you after this
haul I am putting on stopped hauls for a
while maybe most likely but when I
posted my huge Sephora haul I felt like
a little bit guilty that I had been
hauling so much like high-end makeup
even though I did do in H&amp;amp;M huh so how
many halls but today's video is going to
be a drugstore haul but not necessarily
like stuff at the drugstore
I have brands here that I've never tried
before I've never tried any products
from Catrice so I wanted to try that out
and I've also heard amazing things about
the brand Kiko Milano so I really wanted
to try out Kiko stuff so I placed an
order on the Kiko website which i think
is also a drugstore brand just not in
the United States they do ship over here
but I don't think it originated here I
live in Miami and there is a Kiko store
in Miami which I need to go to soon but
anyway so these are affordable makeup
products even though I can't get them at
my local Walgreens it's technically
drugstore prices but I also placed an
order on elf cosmetics because
everything was 50% off recently so I
placed an order I saw a bunch of new
things that they recently came out with
and I bought a ton of them not a ton but
I bought some stuff and I'm going to
share them with you today
they do send me PR but I hadn't gotten
any PR from elf in a while so I decided
to place an order since I love elf
anyway ok so I'm going to start off with
the stuff that I actually did get at
Walgreens it's just three things revlon
has come out with a bunch of new things
and I saw these palettes at Walgreens
and I bought them even though I didn't
have high hopes for these because they
reminded me a lot of the Maybelline
palettes that I did not like at all
but I decided to give them a try anyway
because they are different brands so you
know I have this one on my eyes today
actually by the way they are the not
just nudes eyeshadow palettes they came
out with two colors this one has like
warm bronzy shades and this one has like
more purpley Mavi shades this one is on
my eyes and this one is called
passionate nudes and it comes with a
little brush I actually used it today
it's the decent brush
it's not a sponge tip which I can
appreciate so I actually am pretty
impressed with this one I haven't tried
this palette yet but I applied this one
into my crease this is on my outer
quarters and I have this all over my lid
and this one just like in the center of
my lid and surprisingly the matte shades
are better than the shimmery shades in
this palette I did wet these eyeshadows
to apply them on my lid because by
themselves they aren't as pigmented as I
want them to be but I still can work
with them I actually like this palette a
lot more than the nude palette from
Maybelline Oh
just drop that and then this one is
called romantic nudes and it's filled
with like nice cranberry mock shades
like I said and then the other thing I
bought from Revlon is their Ultra HD
matte lip color I have heard mixed
reviews about this a lot of people don't
like them but I decided to try out like
the more nude shade just I don't know I
really like the packaging it's honestly
what did it for me look how pretty
it's like frosted it's really nice this
one is in the shade seduction it's a
really pretty just like everyday nudie
pink so I'm gonna I haven't tried this
yet but I will so now I'm gonna go on to
the stuff I got on the elf website so
the first thing I noticed when I got on
the website which is initially why I
bought everything because this bad boy
really sparked my interest so this is
the elf artistry eyeshadow palette it
has 20 eyeshadow colors and I don't
really love elfs like large eyeshadow
palettes I don't think they do
eyeshadows very well except their prism
eyeshadows they're amazing they have the
best like metallic eyeshadows in their
prism palettes but every other palette
I've tried hasn't been my favorite but
anyway it comes in like this little
pouch and then this is what it looks
like the reason I bought this is because
it looked so much like a Urban Decay
vice palette online I was like that
looks interesting so this is what it
looks like when you open it it has a
huge freaking mirror which I'm so
excited about this mirror it's a really
great mirror and then it has a
double-ended brush here at the bottom
and this is actually a really really
great brush
then this is what the palette looks like
now I haven't tried it I have to watch
them they're not as good as the prism
eyeshadows but they aren't terrible I
still have to play with them a little
more I have to see how they apply to my
eyes I can't give you guys an actual
review just yet
so this is their artist palette it
totally looks like a vice palette am i
right it does and I got it online and
it's it's really pretty and sleek
I got another lip exfoliator and I
already have the elf lip exfoliator but
they came out with two new scents mint
and sweet cherry and I love anything
cherry flavored cherry scented so I had
to get the sweet cherry I've already
used this these lip exfoliator czar
really good and they're like three
dollars I wish the other brands would
come out with lip scrubs that are in
like a lipstick form like this one
instead of just a pot that you have to
dip your finger in because this is a
little bit like more practical and more
convenient so sweet cherry and it does
smell really good it smells a lot like
cherries but when I'm like scrubbing it
on my lips it has like that weird
artificial cherry flavor so I think I
kind of prefer the original but still I
really cut smells I'm still going to use
it okay really really really really
really exciting things they have new
face brushes and I don't know but elf
has really been stepping up their game
with their face brushes these are
amazing I haven't used them yet but just
by touching them I know I just know this
is their flawless face brush this is
probably my favorite one this would be
so good like for bronzer just look at
this look how beautiful this is
it tapers it's like a paddle style brush
but it's round at the top it is the
softest elf brush I've ever touched in
my entire life
I highly recommend these new brushes
they are so incredible and I've never
really had problems with my elf brushes
shedding not the studio line at least
they're $1.00 brushes are not my
favorite they shed on me a lot but
they're studio brand brushes are amazing
and they're so affordable and then these
two are pretty similar but they do have
a little bit of a different shape this
one is their selfie ready foundation
blurring brush and this is what this one
looks like it's just a nice round little
ball this would be perfect for your
foundation
as it suggests and this one is the
selfie ready powder blurring brush so
this one's for powder and the other one
is for a foundation I mean you use them
for whatever you want because I probably
won't be using this for powder since
it's so small this is what it looks like
this would be perfect for cream bronzer
I feel because I don't know or
contouring it has like a nice shape to
do like a really soft contour or for a
foundation or for whatever you want I'm
pretty sure this is a brand new product
because ELF did send me their brand new
skincare line a few months ago and it
wasn't my favorite but I saw this on the
website and I don't own this so I
decided to pick it up and try it out
this is their exfoliating scrub with
vitamin E purified water and it had
really really good reviews online which
is initially why I picked it up I really
loves elfs skincare packaging I think
it's really cute I love this color and I
tried it yesterday for the first time it
it's pretty good it has like really
really really tiny little beads that
exfoliate your face it's not too
abrasive it's nice the only thing I
don't like is that this does have like
perfume in it it is scented so I don't
know how it's going to work with my
sensitive skin but I'm still going to
continue to try it out cuz as cheap and
as good I was so excited about this when
I saw the elf posted this on Instagram I
knew that I had to get it it is their
illuminating palette elf came out with a
highlighter palette
I was just waiting I was waiting for
them to do this they have a blush
palette a foundation palette a contour
palette and I was just waiting for this
bad boy and it's finally here I love the
packaging it comes in like a nice sleek
I love elf's packaging this has a really
great mirror in it as well and these are
the highlighting colors I'm actually
wearing this one right here on the tops
of my cheekbones right now and I have to
say this palette is amazing the
highlighting shades are very subtle
it doesn't look wet it doesn't have like
a metallic sheen like Mac oh darling or
whisper of guilt or any of those things
it is a nice soft highlight I mean you
could totally see it obviously but it
isn't like a crazy metallic sheen which
I like so if you're someone who is just
starting out in makeup and does
want to do like a crazy wet highlighted
look I would really really really
suggest this highlighting probably it
reminds me a lot of the hourglass
ambient lighting powders that are like
$50 and this whole palette I think I
paid like six dollars for it okay so
let's talk about something that I bought
that I'm not exactly sure I love at all
this is um the elf illuminating mist
inset I've tried the elf regular mist
and set before in the past and I didn't
love it but then they came out with an
illuminating version so I was like all
over that of course but I don't like
this
the main reason why I don't like this is
because of the spray nozzle like the way
that it sprays I tried it today um it
was the first time I tried it out I
tried it today for the first time and
this soaked my face I I sprayed it after
I did my makeup right now like a little
while ago and my face still looks soaked
like in these areas right here I look
really like it like I don't know it
shoots out the most intense I don't know
if I have a bad one like if my spray is
defected but it literally soaked my face
and I only sprayed it twice
I was stretched I look like I had been
caught in the rain so for that reason I
probably won't be using this unless I'm
gonna apply this before I put on all my
makeup kind of like a primer spray so
that it could look nice and dewy or
something I don't know but besides that
I will not be setting my makeup with
this anymore I decided to get something
from there like um regular line like not
their studio line I wanted to try this
this is their prime and stay finishing
powder I got mine in translucent and the
only reason why I wanted to get this is
because sometimes do get oily throughout
the day especially like if it's so hot
outside
I want to tag the oily but sometimes
sometimes there's a little bit too much
to do sometimes very rare and I wanted
to get this just so I could throw this
in my purse and kind of touch up on the
go it's the first time I'm touching it
and it's so silky this feels amazing so
yeah I wanted to get this so I can throw
this in my purse and maybe just like
mattify myself a little bit in certain
areas and that oh just totally put my
whole
your finger in it and I didn't want to
get something so expensive since I
rarely have to touch up my makeup
because I'm so dry so I decided to try
out something from ELF and let me tell
you this feels fantastic
this is new pretty sure it's new I've
never seen this before
this is the lock-on liner and brow cream
I got mine in light brown I guess this
is like elfs version of like a brow
pomade I haven't tried it yet but it
says you can use it in your brows and as
liner so I'm very excited to try this
out oh okay so I bought this because in
my drugstore dupes for high-end makeup
video I talked about how the under eye
setting powder from ELF was a dupe for
the laura mercier secret brightening
powder and I mentioned how the only
thing I don't like is that it has little
glitter particles in it and so many of
you guys said that the new one doesn't
have the glitter in it like they came
out with one that is glitter free so I
decided to pick up a new one because I'm
very excited to see that this might not
have any glitter in it I don't know okay
and this is the last elf
product I purchased this is their
kissing goodbye lip color remover in
clear I have something identical to this
that I bought from Sephora it's like the
Sephora gel lip color remover thing I
don't know but I wanted to buy this to
see how it compared to my Sephora one so
I like these kinds of products to take
off liquid lipsticks because liquid
lipsticks are a biatch to remove and
this is like a cool gel consistency and
I haven't tried it yet but I think I
might like it okay so now let's move on
to Catrice and Kiko Milano I got two of
their highlighting pens this one is the
illuminating highlighter pen which is
like a pinky cool toned really really
intense highlight I've only swatched
this I haven't applied it to my face
but it's intense
very excited to use this like underneath
powder because I think it would look
like insane and this one is their
bronzing highlighter pen which is more
of a gold highlight it's not too dark I
think I could use this as a highlight
anyway but I'm really really really
excited to try these out
I heard really good things about their
lip liners so I decided to get this one
in the shade rosy brown this is the lip
liner I'm wearing underneath a lip
product right now and I love it it
glides on really smoothly it reminds me
a lot of the LA girl lip liners I like
la girl la girl lip um la girls it
reminds me a lot of those lip liners
very very similar very creamy they're
retractable which are my favorite kind
of lip liners because they just go on a
lot smoother this was so affordable and
it is a really pretty rosy Brown exactly
what it's called very very pretty I
heard a lot of buzz about their liquid
metal eyeshadows so I about three of
them and they're so good but I will say
that these are better applied wet and I
think that that's what they're meant for
anyway so you can totally use them both
wet or dry they just look a lot better
wet they look stunning
these are very soft eye shadows I was so
scared that they were gonna get hear it
from the male and they were going to be
shattered because a lot of people had
problems with that but thankfully they
all came perfectly fine so these are the
three colors I got this one is called
under treasure and this one is
well I guess I spoke too soon huh like I
was saying before this eye shadow
totally betrayed me this one is called
under treasure and it is broken but it
is also very very beautiful
it's the perfect this one is like
completely falling apart I just jinxed
myself but anyway it's a really pretty
everyday color really stunning try to
buy this in store this one is called
what do you see and I wanted to get this
because I thought this would look
stunning all over the lid like wet of
course because it's so pigmented when
it's wet and I thought this would look
beautiful like a nice deep teal look and
then this one is a very popular one this
one's called moths like jagger
I like that name and it is such a pretty
topi purple mami shade really really
really really really gorgeous and this
one is perfectly fine and then the last
thing I got from Catrice was their
liquid liner and this one is called
don't leave me I don't know why it's not
just called black but don't leave me
don't you dare leave me and this is
their waterproof version maybe that's
why it's called to link me I don't have
any liquid liner that's waterproof
because I hate waterproof makeup but I
wanted to give it a try because
sometimes it rains ok we're almost done
now let's talk about the stuff I bought
on the Kiko website very excited I gotta
say I was most excited for this Kiko
stuff I really really was because for
like a million years a million years I
have heard that their water eyeshadow in
the shade
208 was a dupe for Mac whisper of guilt
so I had to get my hands on it I ended
up picking four of their water I shadow
they have a bunch of different
eyeshadows but I really wanted to try
this one because you can use it dry or
you can use it wet very similar to the
Catrice ones but these these are more
intense this one is in the shade 208
like I said this is like a dupe for Mac
whisper of guilt you know word on the
blogger street this is what it looks
like it is a beautiful beautiful
beautiful
um gold and pretty sure this is the one
that was the dupe so beautiful I almost
want to put it on my face right now but
I don't have a brush but it'd be weird
if I applied it with this brush probably
but I'm gonna do it anyway PS there's a
mirror in here
well oh-ho
oh that's what I'm talking about
stunning amazing get your hands on this
it's so affordable get your hands on it
it's so good I'm excited okay so that is
208 and then I got three other colors
this one is in the shade 200 this one is
beautiful beautiful beautiful
I would totally use this as a highlight
as well this one is more pinky more
champagne like a topi kind of like
intense highlight these are eyeshadows
by the way you could totally use this
all over your lid amazing and then these
two I got specifically for eyeshadow
those other two I got because I thought
they would look beautiful on the face
but this one is in the shade 204 this
one is such a pretty like purple mob
with a little bit of cranberry in there
I don't know I thought it would like
look really nice for the holidays so I
decided to get this out one to--for
actually really like the packaging you
would never think I like to put a mirror
on an eyeshadow but I kind of liked it
and then I got this one in the shade 203
which is like identical to 204 but um I
bought them online and I didn't notice
but to my surprise they swatch
completely different so I am happy that
I did pick up both of them because they
don't swatch the same even though I look
like I'm holding two of the exact same
items all right so let's talk about the
lip color I'm wearing this is the Kiko
matte muse lipstick they have like their
own version of liquid lipsticks this
one's called plushy rose and I love the
packaging on these they look like nail
polish bottles like long nail polish
bottles and the applicator is so freakin
weird
it has like the weirdest doe foot
applicator the shape is completely weird
but I love it I love it I love it it
feels a little bit tacky but it dries
completely matte it doesn't bother me at
all it's comfortable and I really really
like this color I think it's so pretty
just like for day-to-day and it's glass
and it's nice it's a nice and fancy I
like it okay the last three things I got
from Kiko two of them are with I almost
dropped
two of them are long-lasting eye shadow
sticks I have mine in zero five and zero
six this one in zero six is a nice like
topi bronze shade it's not too warm
which I really really like and then this
one in zero five yes it's like a cool
tone Mavi purple like silvery shade
really pretty and then the last thing in
this Hall is the Kiko intensely lavish
lip pencil this is part of like a
collection that Kiko had because it's
not in the same packaging as the other
stuff I bought they came out with like a
collection and they came out with like
bronzers and all that stuff but I
decided to just try out this lip liner
it's such a beautiful packaging like
this collection is like all rose gold
and really really nice so this is their
intensely lavish lip pencil in the shade
alright the shade is 0-1
I hate when companies do that but anyway
the reason why I wanted to get this is
because I saw swatches online and this
looked so incredibly similar to Mac sore
lip pencil so I wanted to see if it was
a dupe and it is really really pretty I
don't know if it's a dupe yeah I got a
pull out sore but yeah okay guys so that
completes the saw I'm so excited to try
out Kiko and Catrice I've never tried
out those brands before and I'm very
excited for all the elf stuff I got
because it's new and poppin and I love
elf so thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
