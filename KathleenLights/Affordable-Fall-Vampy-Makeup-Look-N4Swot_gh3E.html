tutorial on this look actually wore this
look the other day I'm wearing the color
pop matte X lippy stick in chateau I
mentioned this lip color in a recent
like favorite fall lipstick video and I
wore out the other day I was wearing a
look extremely similar to this and I
loved it so much I wanted to film it but
I thought I would recreate it with more
affordable products so everything in
this video is pretty affordable I love
this look I love really really deep
matte lipstick and as you know this
color is one of my favorites and I
thought these eyes just complimented the
lip so well usually with a bold lip like
this I will go like pretty bare on the
eyes but for fall in winter I think it's
really pretty so yeah I love this looks
so much and it's so easy to recreate as
all my looks are but yeah I do want to
mention I'm using kind of random
eyeshadows in this video they're all
affordable but they are from different
palettes I'm using like 3 different
palettes in this video but yeah just use
similar products you have at home and if
you want to see how to get this vampy
look just keep on watching
ok so I'm going to start off by priming
my lids with the collection lasting
perfection concealer and I'm going to
blend that in and then I'm going to set
that with the NYX HD finishing powder
feel free to use an eye primer I find
that concealer works well with my dry
eyelids so I'm going to jump into the
Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral matte
palette and I'm going to take that
little shade I pointed at and I'm just
going to blend some of this color into
the crease so that the other shades
blend nicer on the eyelid and then I
jumped into this I know it's so random
but I took this Milani palette this is
the bare necessities everyday eyes eye
shadow palette and I take that dark
brown chocolate shade and I'm going to
run that really really close to my
lashes kind of creating a thick liner
with a powder eye shadow and then I took
the Milani supreme Kohl Kajal eyeliner
in the shade blackest black and I'm
going to tightline with this but then
I'm going to smudge a little bit really
really close to my lashes kind of on top
of the brown eyeshadow
and then with that same brush I'm just
going to buff in this black eyeliner
kind of kind of create a smoky effect
it's going to kind of resemble that
messy look but it looks put together in
the end then I'm going to take that
other eyeshadow I pointed out and with a
more fluffy brush I'm just going to buff
over everything I just did I don't want
any harsh lines I want to make sure
everything looks nice and blended so I
went back in with the eyeliner I do this
a few times just to get the intense
smokiness so I put on some eyeliner on
my lid and then blended it out some more
with that brush I'm winging it out
because I'm going to clean that up later
with a makeup remover wipe so jumping
into a new eyeshadow palette this is the
morphe 12s it's one of their smaller
palettes I'm going to take that deep
cranberry shade and I'm going to buff it
right on top and then I'm going to mix
those two colors I pointed out and then
do the exact same thing I'm just
layering these warm shimmery eyeshadows
because I think they look really pretty
on top of each other so I'm just buffing
that in right on top of that eyeliner
just making it nice and smoky then I'm
going back into this eyeshadow and
blending over everything one more time
and look at that I busted out the
eyeliner again doing the exact same
thing I'm applying this really close to
my lashes but I'm dragging it out a bit
because I want the outer corners to be a
little bit more black and I am just you
know buffing that in once again only I'm
not putting as much pressure on the
brush this time because I don't want the
black eyeliner to blend away completely
I do want it to look nice and black
towards the lash line then I took a wipe
to clean up the edges and make it more
of a cat eye look and then my camera
stopped recording before I realized it
but I added some more black eyeliner to
the base as you can see it's a little
bit darker I don't know why but my new
camera shuts off sometimes anywho I took
those two eyeshadows and I'm using that
to highlight underneath my brow bone and
then to move on to the face I'm taking
the NYX angel whale primer and the NYX
born to glow illuminating primer I'm
mixing those two and I'm applying them
to my face
and then I went in with the LA girl Pro
coverage HD long-wear illuminating
foundation I am in the shade fair and I
love this foundation show up so much so
much I have been using it non-stop I
have been using it daily it's crazy I
love it love it love it has such a
beautiful finish I don't know I just I
really like it so I've been using it a
ton for concealer I took the Rimmel wake
me up concealer I am in the shade very
fair / light but I didn't think it was
light enough so on top of it I took the
collection lasting perfection concealer
just to brighten up the look a little
bit more and I blended that in with my
Real Techniques sponge to set my
concealer I use the NYX HD finishing
powder and I use that to set my under
eyes and then I made the mistake by
using this to set my entire face I don't
know why I did that I had never tried it
as a setting powder before and I did and
I do not recommend it because my bronzer
just looked really really weird on top
of this powder don't know how to explain
it but it did not set my foundation
nicely just a little tick at least not
on my dry skin so to finish up the eyes
I'm taking that same Milani Kohl Kajal
eyeliner and I'm running this on my
waterline but then I'm dragging it a
little bit under as well just to make it
nice and smoky and I'm buffing that out
with a pencil brush then I realized I
wasn't zoomed in okay so I'm taking that
color in the Sonia Kashuk palette and
I'm really buffing out that black
eyeliner I just smudged just to avoid
some harsh lines I want it nice and
smoky and blended and then I applied
some of that really pretty warm I shadow
on top from the morphe palette just to
tie everything together for my inner
corner highlight I took the Roses the
Physicians Formula natural nude
highlighting thing it's like a little
shimmer box and I use that to highlight
my inner corners and then I applied some
Maybelline lash sensational mascara I
applied like a ton of this mascara on my
top and bottom lashes and then I am done
with the eyes very easy now I'm just
really bronzing up the skin I am using
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
and warming up that face
and also applying some demonic you know
just to make everything match for blush
I decided to go with something really
natural since the lips are going to be
so dark so I took the hmm powder blush
in the shade brown sugar it goes with
everything I really love this blush pop
it on my cheeks and then I took the
essence pure nude highlighter and I am
highlighting my face with this but I'm
kind of putting this everywhere I put
this on my nose and my cheeks on my
forehead by my eyebrows on my lip I put
this everywhere since it's a very
natural highlight I wanted my entire
face to glow but then I took the
Physicians Formula natural nude a little
shimmer strip and I applied that to the
very tops of my cheekbones because it's
a very intense highlight and I wanted
something a little bit more intense on
top of the natural highlight okay to
finish off this look I am going in with
my lip color and this is the colour-pop
lippie stick in chateau and that
completes this look thank you guys so
