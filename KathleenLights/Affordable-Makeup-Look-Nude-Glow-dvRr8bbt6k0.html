kind of like a getting ready like I get
ready with me video there are a couple
new drugstore products I got a few weeks
ago but I haven't tried out yet that I
want to try out here on camera it's not
really a first impressions or anything
because a lot of this stuff I've already
used but a few things are new and we
could test them out together while I get
ready honestly I wasn't even planning on
filming today but I got power I finally
got electricity today a couple of hours
ago I'm sure you guys know but I live in
Miami so I had to evacuate due to
Hurricane Emma I was actually like in a
flood zone and everything and as I'm
sure you guys saw the storm was it was
crazy and it was like surpassing a
category 5 it was really terrifying and
my neighborhood was in a mandatory
evacuation zone so thankfully we were
able to evacuate we left to Mississippi
and I just finally got back last night
it took like 20 hours to get back the
traffic was so insane coming back into
Florida there were a lot of people in my
family who couldn't evacuate I mean
there was a ton of people in Florida
period who couldn't evacuate which makes
me so sad because I know not everyone is
able to evacuate even though they want
to so if you stayed here during the
hurricane I hope that you are safe and
everything is okay it's important is
your health and your safety when we got
back to our house luckily there was only
a little bit of damage I mean there were
trees fallen everywhere my fence
completely came off it was like on the
floor when we got here we had a couple
trees that fell and we had some water
damage inside the house but I mean all
of those things are replaceable people
are not replaceable so I'm very thankful
that we are okay the dogs are ok my
family is ok I know there are still a
ton of people without power and so many
homes were really damaged Key West or
the Florida Keys were damaged so badly
and I lived there for a year and it's so
sad to see people's homes just like
everything they owned just destroyed
it's sad but long as your life is ok
that is what matters I just want to
thank you guys so much for all the
support you've shown me on Instagram and
social media in general with everything
that has happened this month I think you
guys so much and thank you for hearing
me out and for being accepting and
loving
and I appreciate all of you guys so much
it's been a rough couple of weeks but
all I can do at this point is just
continue life and better myself and
spread positivity and just do good
things in the world and again I just
want to thank you so much for everything
so yeah guys I'm just gonna get into it
if I seem a little down in this video
it's just a lot going on I actually have
family that are staying with me right
now because they don't have power in
their house yet so if I seem a little
low or whatever you know obviously I
wasn't gonna film today because I look
crazy but as soon as my power came back
on I was like oh my gosh I'm gonna film
okay so I'm gonna start off by priming
my face I just recently purchased this
this is the Catrice nude glow primer
liquid skin illuminator with pomegranate
oil they already have a prime and fine
primer but this one is illuminating
which I think it's new I had never seen
it before
I love Catrice it's so affordable but
I'm rarely disappointed by them alright
so that gave me a nice nice glow my skin
feels hydrated too so that's awesome
for foundation I'm going in with the
Maybelline Dream cushion in shade 30 I
took my lighting is so weird and I'm
just gonna use a Beauty Blender to apply
this if at any point this video like
turns into a voiceover that's because
like I said there are a lot of people in
this house and Cubans don't know how to
speak at a quiet volume every time I go
out in public I have to like to my
family like a hundred times cuz they
just they just don't know how loud
they're talking honestly I don't even
know what I'm doing in this video today
I want to try out a couple of products
but it's gonna be so simple and basic
but if any of you guys out there like
simple and basic this is for you I
really love this cushion foundation I
haven't found a cushion I really really
like but this one is awesome because it
has a nice coverage like it has medium
coverage and it just looks good on the
skin it makes you
like a nice healthy complexion I'm gonna
apply concealer but I'm also gonna use
that concealer to prime my eyelids I'm
gonna use the color pop no filter
concealer in the shade light neutral and
this one looks super light at first but
it does oxidize just a little bit like
right away it doesn't oxidize throughout
the day kind of bucks the dices on the
spot and then it looks fine
I'm really excited for how to get away
with murder for that to come back it's
my favorite Shonda Rhimes show for sure
I love to under eyes but that's my
favorite even though my favorite
character is no longer on the show I
don't want to ruin anything but they did
something bad that's all I'm going to
say so I'm sad about that and it's gonna
kill me to watch it but I just I can't
get enough of it I can't wait for it to
come back right now I'm currently
watching Supernatural I think I
mentioned that in a recent video I kind
of started it as like a background show
to just play while I was doing things
because I know if any of you guys are
like me in that sense I can't do it mmm
burger I can't do anything in silence
even if I'm taking a shower even though
the sound of the shower should be enough
but no I can't
I need voices or like some sort of music
TV show something so I will literally
put my phone in my shower and watch
shows like Supernatural and stuff but
like I was saying it was a show I just
wanted us like a background thing but I
ended up really liking it and I won
season 2 I'm almost done with season 2
it's not as scary as I thought I'm gonna
take my wet n wild pressed powder in
warm light and I'm gonna use this to set
my concealer
okay I've kind of put this powder
everywhere pretty much and now I'm just
gonna move on to the eyes I'm like I
said I'm gonna do something really
simple but I promise you actual
tutorials will be coming soon
like real tutorials I tutorial for the
eyes I wanted to try this out I actually
bought this because I want to do a
drugstore version of my waterproof
makeup tested video but I haven't filmed
that video yet and will but I haven't
but I'm just gonna try it out today Joe
what is this okay this is the essence
two-in-one I shadow and liner waterproof
in the shade peach perfect it's got a
really pretty champagne shimmer I'm just
gonna blend that in with my finger I
think I'm just gonna do like a one eye
shadow look thing here because I'm
honestly just gonna go downstairs and
play dominoes with my family but I just
had to film that's obviously my priority
this is a really pretty color it's not
going on chunky or anything the
application is pretty smooth it's very
subtle I would have liked it to be a
little more blingy that's just probably
because it's kind of like blending in
with my skin tone I would assume if you
had like very light skin or a deeper
skin tone it would look a little bit
better on your like it would stand out a
little more oh crap I didn't put a
crease color on first that's fine that's
mine can I take an eyeshadow just any
random eyeshadow color it's fine this is
kind of like a mid-tone neutral light
beige a pinky Brown I'm only gonna apply
a very light hand of this I can't show
you what I shadow it is yet but you will
find out very soon so I'm just gonna put
a light dusting in my crease like very
very subtle just so there's a little bit
of definition there
okay so eyeshadow blends really nicely
on top of this base I thought I was
gonna be patchy or sticky but it's not
I'm gonna go in with this Burt's Bees
trio I just recently purchased this they
came out with like a brand new
collection of a bunch of different
things different trios different blushes
so I picked up this one in shimmering
nudes and I'm gonna use this bronze
color all over my lid but you're
somebody who's this this color right
here I'm gonna use this to highlight my
brow bone I haven't tested these
eyeshadows out yet and I haven't heard
anybody talk about them yet and I'm
gonna take that on my inner corners as
well I'm gonna pop something else in my
inner corners when I'm done with my eye
makeup but just a little bit these
aren't like super incredibly pigmented I
need to show you swatches you can see
they're they're very lightly pigmented
I'm gonna take a big all of our shader
brush this one's from flower beauty I'm
gonna take it the bronze color and this
is what I'm gonna put on my entire lid I
definitely recommend using kind of like
a sticky base or a sticky primer
underneath these shadows just because
like I said they're not extremely
pigmented I don't know how I feel about
it just yet might be just a little bit
too subtle for me there are so many
eyeshadow have the drugstore already
that are so good and I don't know I
don't know if this trio is worth the
money have you guys tried these let me
know what you think in the comments
below maybe it's just this one that
isn't like the best let me know your
thoughts on on these products now I'm
taking the Rimmel exaggerate waterproof
eyeliner also about this from Hendrix or
waterproof video and this is in the
color rich brown and tightline with this
and apply it to my waterline as well
I'm gonna submerge some of this eyeliner
really close to my lashes this is a
trick I do all the time when I don't
want to put on a winged liner or
anything like that I mean which is most
of the time obviously this has a little
smudger on the back I just like this
someone yet
I'm gonna take the bronze color I used
all over my lid I'm gonna smudge this
underneath my lower lash line this is a
crown c-51 3 brush I think ahead sent my
shadow on that brush I sure did I sure
did so because I had eye shadow on this
brush from a previous thing it looks
darker on this side I'm just gonna take
a deep matte brown eyeshadow and I am
going to just smudge this really close
to my lashes since it already got really
smoky under here on this side
now I'm gonna take the colour-pop press
powder highlighter in the shade here
kitty-kitty and I'm just gonna apply
this on my inner corners I cannot say
the name of this without like in my head
going here kitty-kitty
where did that come from where did that
little was saying originated from here
kitty-kitty think I asked that that
comes from something I just don't know
so I'm hoping this on my inner corner
just so it could look real bling in
there alright so for this boring AF look
I'm just gonna pop on some mascara I say
when I first started doing like
eyeshadow and all that stuff this is the
kind of look I did all the time and
honestly it just works it gives your
eyes some definition some smokiness yeah
it looks really really natural okay so
I'm just gonna finish putting on the
cookie volume and length mascara and I
will be right back
okay so now that the eyes are done that
was so easy you could literally do this
look in like five minutes and then go to
high school or whatever for my face I'm
actually gonna try out a contour I've
never used before this is the new NYX 3
steps to sculpt face sculpting palette
this sucks
the shape shape sucks it's just it's
just glitter like loose glitter and
chunky it's weird I don't like it I also
don't love this maybe if you have oily
skin you would love that to set your
under eyes but I don't love it but I
haven't tried out the contour so I don't
want to rule this out completely without
trying to contour first
okay I don't hate it I don't hate it at
all it's very subtle but her face
products I prefer something to be a
little bit more subtle that you can
build up versus something that's way too
pigmented and just ruins everything
right off the bat because it was just
like lay a stripe on your face so yeah
it's not that I actually like it and I
like the color it's a very cool tone but
it's not too great I think I might keep
this just for the contour I think I
really like this I don't know if it's
worth the money if you only like one
product out of the three but I'm gonna
hold onto it and play around with it a
little more cos I do like how it
contoured the skin for blush I'm using
one of the new Burt's Bees ones and this
one's called bear peach which is taking
a stippling brush
this one's from makeup forever this is a
pretty matte blush for the most part but
there's like a little something to it
those are my frames shaking I think that
was an airplane I was like Noah Florida
I don't need an earthquake anyway
this is like a very satiny blush that's
the word it's a satin finish and I
really like it it's so pretty as it
gives you kind of like a soft glow like
very very very soft but it doesn't
emphasize your pores or anything it's
very minimal mm-hmm
this is so pretty and then for highlight
I'm just gonna go back into here
kitty-kitty and I'm gonna use this on my
face so intense I love this highlight
color pop highlighters from me are very
hit and miss some of them are too chunky
and glittery for me some of them I
really don't like at all but this one is
fabulous it's so smooth and it's very
very intense as you can see like very
reflective but it's not glittery it is
stunning and I put some on my nose here
actually I'm gonna contour my nose let's
see I don't even know what I would
contour with
I don't think my nose needs contouring I
don't think anybody's nose needs
contouring we do what you want obviously
it's your face but I'm just you know
trying it out can you and see that
that's not even look like I do anything
probably not okay
I'm doing that wrong whatever no I
probably have a girl good nose but let's
move on okay so to set down that
highlight just to make it one with the
skin I'm going to set my face I can't
find my fan anywhere have a handheld
battery-powered fan that I use to dry my
face when I said it but oh I don't know
why it squirted out so much right here
so I'm just gonna use my actual and I'm
gonna let this dry and I'll be right
back okay so I applied way too much of
that wet and wild setting spray for my
whole face looks like completely Dooley
but I'm upset I'm into it I'm actually
gonna take this makeup revolution vivid
baked bronzer in golden days and I'm
just gonna add a little bit of this just
to bronze the skin a little more and I
go luminous way not that I need any more
human ah City but feel like adding a
little bit more
for lips you could literally do any kind
of lip with this look it's so neutral
but I'm going on the nude I know I know
that's so boring but I just got this in
the mail this is the la girl lip if I
stylo one swipe intense creamy color and
this is the shade dreamer and it's one
of those like click up pens
it's non retractable so don't click it
all the way up because you won't be able
to click it down and I want to try it
out it looks like such a gosh is so
creamy wow that color is so gorgeous
it's a very very nude lip but it's very
creamy I really like this formula I'm
gonna plan another lip color on top just
to darken it a bit this is the j-cap
fabulous lipstick in the shade of
vanilla bean this is darker this one's
like more pink actually I think this
might be paler I really like this
lipstick too by the way I just got it
and I love it
such a pretty color but anyway that
completes this look and that completes
this video I hope you enjoyed it I know
it was very simple but maybe it's the
kind of look you want to recreate
somebody out there maybe and I use only
affordable products which is awesome a
lot of affordable makeup but anyway that
completes this video guys thank you so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
