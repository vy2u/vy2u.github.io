to get my favorite purple smokey eye and
a lot of the products I use are from the
drugstore so it is very affordable I'm
just going to be taking my ELF eyelid
primer and using that all over my eyes
then I'm gonna take my NYX eyeshadow
base in skin tone which is just a yellow
toned eyeshadow base and I have to layer
these two things because individually on
their own they're not so great but
paired together my eyeshadow lasts all
day so I love using them together
now I'm taking my lust palette from
wet-and-wild
and I'm taking that really vibrant
purple that you see right there and I'm
just gonna use that with a Mac 239 and I
am just gonna put that on my entire lid
I'm really gonna pack this color in got
some fallout there that's why I do my
eyes first I'm really just gonna pack
that in until I get the intensity that I
want
I'm not really gonna take this color
above the crease but I am gonna kind of
make it really define and really round
up to the crease if that makes any sense
well you can see right here what I'm
doing now I'm taking my naked 2 palette
and I'm just taking this color right
here called T's which is just a matte
gray purple kind of color and I'm just
gonna use this because the lust palette
doesn't have a very good transition
color so just with a little blending
brush I'm gonna use that to kind of
blend out the purple a little
now with my Mac 217 I'm going to take
that darker purple right next to it and
I'm just gonna use this to pack some
color out on the outer V and bring it
into the crease a little bit
this part does take a little bit more
time because I am going back and forth
with that same color and building it up
little by little as opposed to just
putting a lot in the outer V and then
having too much and making it look a
little bit muddy because it can get like
that with matte eyeshadows so I'm just
going back and forth and doing a lot of
blending and just building it up so
that's what I'm doing now next taking an
angled brush like this I'm going to take
that first purple we use and I'm just
gonna line it really really close to my
waterline
with that same brush I'm going to go
into that darker purple and do the same
thing but I am gonna connect it to the
top of my eye to the outer corner as you
see what I'm doing there to just kind of
make like a winged cat eye kind of look
you get me yeah and I am NOT gonna take
it past my pupil so I'm just focusing it
on the outer part of my eye now I'm just
taking my Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in midnight master which is
just the black and I'm gonna be lining
my waterline and I'm also going to be
tight lining and now I'm just taking my
master precise eyeliner which is like a
liquid liner with a felt tip and
applicator and this is a little
difficult to explain for me for some
reason but I'm just creating a small
wing as you can see and I'm just gonna
bring it in and then fill in the gap I'm
really focusing the thickness on the
outer part of my eye I don't want a
thick line across my whole eye so I'm
really just gonna make it thick on the
outer V
so as you can kind of see there it just
goes from like thick to barely nothing
at all
now I'm just gonna take this really
unique shade in the lust palette and
it's really similar to Mac's
beauty marked so if you know what that
looks like this is really similar and
with my pencil brush I'm just gonna be
using this color to make it a little
darker on the outer V this does have
some noticeable little glitters in it so
I really like how that makes this look
now I'm just gonna be taking my little
blending brush that I used in the
beginning and taking that same color for
my naked 2 palette I'm just gonna blend
out the look a little bit more not too
much though
because of all the blending we did the
purple we first laid down kind of lost
some of its vibrance you know so I'm
just gonna go back and kind of add some
more purple to just make it look a
little brighter and nicer
for my highlight I'm using the brow bone
shade in the walking on eggshells trio
from when awhile because I feel like the
less palette doesn't really have a nice
highlight shade they're both kind of
matte so I wanted a shimmery highlight
since the whole eye is pretty much matte
so that is what I did for my eyes and
I'm just gonna move on and show you what
I have on my face so I first took my
hard candy sheer envy primer and I put
that all over my face to prime my face I
need to use a primer primer is essential
for me
now I'm taking my Revlon nearly naked
foundation I am in the shade nude and
with my Real Techniques expert face
brush I am just gonna put some on the
back of my hand and put that all over my
face to kind of even out my skin tone
and get rid of all the redness for under
my eyes I'm using the Maybelline dark
circle eraser and that's just gonna
cover up my dark circles and right in my
under eye area
I'm taking my mac msf natural in the
shade medium and I am putting that all
over my face
I'm gonna take my ELF duo it's the one
with the bronzer and the blush and I'm
using the bronzer shade to contour a
little bit I'm not gonna do a heavy Kim
Kardashian contour or anything like that
but just a contour of it
next I'm gonna take my NYC sunny bronzer
and I'm just gonna bronze the rest of my
face and blend everything out evenly
this is my favorite brush for blush and
bronzer now I'm just gonna go back into
that ELF
duo that I used earlier and I'm going to
use that blush shade on my cheeks
okay next is my absolute favorite part
and I have been obsessed with this
L'Oreal magic Lumi light infusing primer
but I use it as a highlight and it is
the most beautiful highlight I can ever
ever talk about so I just add a pump to
the back of my hand and with my brush I
add some on my cheekbones and then I
blend it out a little bit with my brush
but then I go over and blend it out more
with my fingers
this gives such a beautiful glow to your
face I love it so much
I mean look at that okay can you look at
that it's beautiful
I'm gonna take some on the bridge of my
nose and also some on my Cupid's bow
I'm using two things on my lips today
I'm using max Sheen supreme lipstick and
happy a viscous and then I'm gonna layer
it with a pinky ur color I cannot wear
this on its own because it's one of
those baby pink colors that are so white
that you kind of look dead it just it
doesn't look good on its own so on top
of that I'm using my Maybelline Color
Whisperer in the color petal rebel and
this just kind of tones down that white
and just makes it like a baby pink it's
really nice together
so that is it guys that is the purple
smokey eye and I absolutely loved
wearing this when I go out thank you so
