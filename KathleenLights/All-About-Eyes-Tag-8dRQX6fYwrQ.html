tag video and this is the all about eyes
tag and I love this tag I haven't seen a
lot of people do it but I love watching
it so since the first time I saw it I
knew that I wanted to do this tag if you
haven't seen this tag before basically
you just talk about all your favorite
things beauty related concerning your
eyes like eyeshadows and primers and
palettes and stuff like that well one of
them is in beauty related but anyway the
first question is what I cream slash
serum do you use um this is gonna sound
so bad but I do not use eye creams your
serums not because I don't want to but
because I haven't found one that works
for me which with that being said I have
a mission for you guys I'm on the hunt
for a really good eye cream slash serum
so leave a comment down below what your
favorite one is I want one that's you
know firming as well like to help fine
lines because momma got some crow's feet
so if you have one that you've been
using that you really really like leave
a comment down below and then I'll check
it out to see if it works for me as well
so yeah that's the mission for you guys
question number two is what is your
favorite under-eye concealer and that
hands-down has to go to the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer I don't use this a
ton in my videos I use my Maybelline
instant age rewind a lot just because
that one is so easy and personally
better for me for everyday but if you
have dark circles this will cover a
black eye I'm pretty sure pretty sure if
you got punched in the eye go buy
yourself pro longwear concealer because
that'll cover it but I have pretty
intense dark circles not all the time
sometimes it's not so bad but I have
like really really purpley gross looking
eyes and this just covers it so well and
the best part is that this is not cakey
whatsoever you would think something
that is like so full coverage would be
cakey but it's not it has a really nice
thin consistency and it doesn't feel
heavy at all what is your favorite
eyebrow product I personally prefer to
fill in my eyebrows with powder but when
it comes to a specific product I really
do love the Anastasia brow Wiz
it comes with your little product on
this side and then it comes with a
really amazing spoolie on the other side
so this is honestly all you need
me the pen can sometimes look a little
harsh so the fact that this comes with a
spoolie on the other end makes it so
easy to blend out like the harsh lines
and then it looks nice and seamless this
is amazing I got mine at Sephora they
have it at Ulta too as well and on the
Anastasia website and I love this little
guy what is your favorite eyeshadow
primer now this is a new discovery to me
but it is honestly my favorite eyeshadow
primer that I've ever discovered in my
life and it is the lorac behind the
scenes eye primer I used to think that
the Urban Decay primer potion was like
the best thing ever
and it really isn't I mean it's a good
primer but it's nothing out of this
world when I started using this one I
was like wow this one is so much better
it feels a little bit tackier and I feel
like the eyeshadows stick to this better
than they do to the primer potion if
that makes any sense I got this one
about the lorac Pro palette and when I
run out of this sucker I'm gonna go get
me a full size what is your favorite
eyeshadow palette if you guys saw my
perfect palette tag then you already
know what I'm going to say and that is
the Urban Decay original Naked palette
there are no words to describe this
palette it is my absolute favorite it's
filled with every single eyeshadow color
that I could ever possibly need and want
I lean towards more warmer colors so
that's why this one is my favorite I
love the chocolate eNOS to this palette
I don't know what it is about it but
they're so pigmented so buttery so
smooth and honestly I could just live
with this palette forever and be fine I
think it's amazing it really is what is
your favorite eye makeup remover I
really really really love the oil-free
eye makeup remover from Neutrogena I
know that a bunch of different brands
have similar eye makeup removers but
this one is my absolute favorite it is a
little bit greasy when you put it on
your eyelids but it takes off all of my
makeup I just put it on the cotton pad
and with one swipe all of my eye makeup
is gone it's amazing and I like that it
doesn't leave like a thick disgusting
oily residue once I just swipe it off
it's gone and it takes off my mascara
and my eyeliner nicely and that's saying
a lot because I feel like nothing takes
off my eyeliner what is this
what is your favorite mascara my
favorite mascara is the Clinique lash
doubling mascara this has been my
favorite mascara since I was like 15
I've repurchased it every time I run out
since I've been 15 years old that's a
lot of mascara tubes guys that's a love
mascara it just works so well for me
this is probably the only mascara where
I feel like I don't need to curl my
lashes for it to look nice and curled it
holds my curl forever it lengthens it
volumizes and it separates my lashes
really nicely without clumping you know
some mascara will leave like a little
ball right at the top of your lashes and
it's like really frustrating I could do
coat after coat after coat and I feel
like this doesn't this doesn't do it to
my lashes and it's only 14 dollars which
is a lot for a mascara but it's a lot
cheaper than all those other high-end
brands like benefits they're real or all
those other ones that are like in the
20s 14 or 15 it's not too bad next
question is what is your favorite
eyeliner and it asks you to show your
favorite Kohl gel and felt tip eyeliner
but I'm going to sneak in one more and
I'm going to show you my favorite brush
tip eyeliner as well
I feel like brush tips and felt tips are
like completely different like
completely so my favorite brush tip
eyeliner is definitely the NYC liquid
liner I fell in love with this when I
first bought it it is seriously so good
my thing is that I like my eyeliner to
dry matte and this is the maddest matte
I have ever seen in my life it is so
intense and black that I swear I feel
like I don't need any other brush tip
eyeliner for the rest of my life because
I just swooped this on doing a little
flick and it stays bold
and matte and black all day I know some
people have problems with it flaking off
but I personally do not and for two
dollars I mean it's worth it it's so
cheap it's incredible now when it comes
to my favorite gel kohl and felt tip
eyeliner
they're all from the exact same brand I
am so incredibly impressed with the
Maybelline eye studio line I personally
think that they make the best eyeliners
I have the gel eyeliner in blackest
black it's a really really dark intense
black it doesn't come off great at all
this is even
laquer then a lot of high-end ones I've
seen it's blacker than black track
fluidline or whatever that Mac one is
called that I refused to buy because
this one is a million times better
you guys know my love for the Maybelline
master drama eyeliner I use this pretty
much in every single tutorial I love
putting black on my waterline I know not
everybody does but I really do love it
and this one is the best one it is so
creamy and swatches like instantly black
like I don't know it's just so intense I
love this this is one of the few
eyeliners that I feel actually stays on
my waterline because so many just look
like a hot mess 20 minutes later and
this one doesn't do that it's so creamy
and amazing and I and I love it and then
of course staying with the eye Studio
line my favorite felt tip eyeliner is
the Maybelline master precise felt tip
liner I haven't used it in a few videos
lately because mine completely dried out
and I need to go repurchase another one
is like oh okay it was dried out 20
minutes ago there is no product on the
tip anymore though it's like it's time
to it's time to have a new one but I
just love the fact that it's so long and
gets so incredibly skinny at the very
very tip which makes it so easy to use
and you can just stamp it across your
lid and you're done it I think it's very
much beginner friendly if you're having
a problem with felt tip eyeliner
oh okay I don't even know how this
happened if you're having trouble with
felt tip eyeliner definitely check out
the master precise because I love it
clearly there's still stuff in this what
is your favorite single eyeshadow my
favorite single eyeshadow in the entire
world is from Mac and I keep it in my
really really random Mac palette and it
is this little bad guy right here and it
is called amber lights and I swear it is
the most gorgeous eyeshadow I have ever
seen I feel like every time I look at
this eyeshadow I'm like wow that is like
gorgeous and I feel like no other
eyeshadow makes me feel that way it's
like a very burnt orange e-gold
I don't even know how to explain it but
it looks amazing in the summer and it
looks really pretty on blue eyes and
green eyes and it even looks beautiful
on brown eyes because it looks beautiful
on everyone in the summer I like to just
throw this all over my lid put on some
eyeliner and I'm out the door and people
are like oh my god I love your eyeshadow
and I'm like thanks max amber lights
it's amazing and the last question is
what are your favorite sunglasses this
is the question that isn't beauty
related but my favorite sunglasses are
these right here these are the new style
Wayfarers I don't know how to say that
word but these are the new styles of the
Wayfarers um the originals are a little
bit like too large for my taste so I
really really like these these are ray
bands then he got me these glasses for
Christmas actually and I pretty much
wear these every single day when I'm
driving in the Sun is like beaming in my
face so yeah I think that's it that is
the end of this tag I hope you enjoyed
