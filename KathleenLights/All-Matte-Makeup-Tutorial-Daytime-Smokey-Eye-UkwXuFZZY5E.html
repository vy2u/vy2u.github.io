a makeup tutorial on this look right
here I think this is the first makeup
tutorial I've ever done where I'm
completely matte I'm like matte guys I'm
Matt I'm looking at my skin up close and
I'm not used to ever looking this matte
but I kind of like it I actually did add
a little bit of highlight on the tip of
my nose I don't know why but I did I
love this look I think it's very sexy
and smoky but very simple at the same
time I feel like this is the perfect
look for anything any kind of occasion
if you're going to a wedding if you're
going to a baby shower if you're going
to prom if you're going to a graduation
it's not super plain but it's not
dramatic either you know it's somewhere
in between I love wearing this look with
no falsies like just a ton of mascara I
know I've been saying this in like every
video but I was smelling a candle and I
accidentally burned off some of my
lashes it's a long story but since I
couldn't put on just mascara alone on
this side cuz you couldn't see anything
I decided to add individual lashes on
this I only and hopefully it doesn't
look bad this look is so pretty for
those of you with green eyes or brown
eyes or hazel eyes I think they pinky
purpley tones in the brown eyeshadows
really complement those colors but
anybody can wear this so yeah if you
want to see how to get this 100% matte
makeup look then just keep watching okay
so I'm going to start off by priming my
eyelids I'm using the Urban Decay primer
potion in the shade enigma I've really
been liking this because I cover up it
covers up all my veins I'm taking this
Anastacio eyeshadow in the shade bone to
kind of set that primer down and then I
applied some tape to the corners of my
eyes to create kind of like a cat eye
effect make sure when you are doing this
you put the tape on the back of your
hand a couple times so it doesn't stick
to the skin I took the Anastacio
eyeshadow in the shade they are eight
and I was just applying that into my
crease and buffing that close to the
tape and then I took another on
associate I shadow this one is in the
shade Birkin and I'm pretty much doing
the exact same thing I am buffing this
into my crease but also applying it to
the outer corners as well I took this
NARS eyeshadow in the shade so fááá
and I am just
buffing that on the outer corners and
into my crease as well I'm pretty much
doing the exact same process with all
the shadows only I'm going from light to
dark to create kind of like a gradient
effect with these colors I went back
into de-rate by Anastacio and I'm just
blending out the harsh edges in my
crease so everything is nice and blended
so this is another NARS eyeshadow this
is in the shade Coconut Grove it's kind
of like a super dark matte brown and on
an angled brush this is in angled brush
from zoeva I'm creating a winged
eyeliner but it's gonna be a lot softer
and a lot easier to do because you're
doing it with eye shadow so it won't be
as harsh or as hard to do so I'm just
getting really close to the tape the
tape is kind of like my guideline to
create that wing you see what I'm doing
so I'm also taking a little blending
brush and buffing some of that coconut
row right and the outer corner is really
close to the tape just so it can be nice
and blended and then I went back in with
the angled brush and coconut grove and
sharpen that up a little bit I'm taking
a Nastasia bone again and I'm using this
to highlight underneath my brow bone and
now we can move on to Zee face what I
took off the tape and now I'm moving on
to the face I'm using the NYX angel oil
primer to prime my face for foundation
and the foundation I'm using today is
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation I have the shade linen I
really like this foundation when I want
to look a little bit more matte because
it has kind of like a satin finish it's
not completely matte but on my dry skin
it does look a little bit like satiny
you know I like it though I like it
doesn't look drying or anything to go
underneath my eyes I thought that the
collection perfect lasting concealer was
literally ideal for this look because it
is a matte concealer I don't know how to
explain it but it blends out really well
and it has great coverage but it doesn't
look dewy under the eyes at all so if
you have an oily under eye area i really
suggest this concealer it's very I don't
know what I'm doing there but it's very
inexpensive and it has great coverage to
set that I'm using the it cosmetics bye
bye pours powder and I'm applying that
underneath my eyes with the morphe 48
brush or a 46 I believe so I'm just
setting that so
increase underneath the eyes and then I
thought you know what I want to be mad
so I'm just going to go ahead and set
the rest of my face I probably should
have switched brushes because this is
very little for the whole face but
whatever I went with it so to finish off
the eyes I'm taking the essence smoky
liner this is like a Kajal liner like a
Kohl liner in black really black really
awesome great for smudging I took the
NARS eyeshadow in the shade Coconut
Grove and I'm just buffing that really
really close to the eye liner to create
kind of like a smoky effect and then I
went into the NARS eyeshadow in the
shade so fááá and I pretty much did
the exact same thing making it nice deep
and a smoky I took the anastacio
eyeshadow in the shade a rate one more
time and just buff that underneath my
lower lash line with a pencil brush so
it's not too harsh or too dark and I
decided to go in with some individual
lashes on my left eye you guys know I
accidentally burned them off with the
flame of Kendall long story but I
decided to pop them on my left eye I
didn't do it on my right eye do you
think it looks bad I don't know I think
it doesn't look too bad I put on some
Jordana best lash extreme mascara and
then popped on some Ardell individuals
on my left eye and I think that it
balances out pretty well I just
highlighted my inner corner with that
bone shadow so to finish off the face
I'm taking the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer and I chose this bronzer because
it's not completely like 100% matte it
has a little bit of life to it not like
shimmer or anything but a little bit of
life to it so I thought it would
complement this look really well and
then from my cheeks I decided to go in
with a bronzer by urban decay this is in
the shade sunkissed but it's too pinky
tone for the whole face so I like using
it on my cheeks I think it gives you
like a really pretty gorgeous summery
look to the cheeks nice and warm really
pretty as a blush I wanted a little bit
of something like a little bit of
highlight so I took the Laura Mercier
matte highlight and I just buff that on
my nose I don't know why but I did
so for the finishing touch I'm going in
with these you a liquid lipstick in the
shade dude to the leche I thought I'd
complimented the eyes perfectly and that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I
see you in my next video bye look I'm
wearing right now
no twirl on this Luke Porter her but
since I didn't but sin but since I he's
my bad I love the coral tones to these
flowers I think it would look so
beautiful with a peachy coral lipstick I
love this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
