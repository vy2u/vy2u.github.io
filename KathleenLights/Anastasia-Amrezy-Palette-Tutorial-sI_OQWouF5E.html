a makeup tutorial using the I'm Rosie
I'm Rosie and razy
it's using this palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills oh I really love this
palette I wasn't gonna get it at first
but I really really love the colors and
actually haven't seen many tutorials on
this palette and I know that Anastasia
came out with another one called Miah
Miah so this one like nobody cares about
anymore but I really love this one I did
a look mainly focusing on these colors
right here which are probably everyone
else's favorite colors but this is the
look I came up with it honestly the look
that I see myself wearing a lot from
this palette so in today's video I
didn't use the false eyelashes even
though I think this look would look
really pretty with fake eyelashes but I
didn't I don't know if it looks easy but
it is super super easy so if you want to
see how to get this look then just keep
on watching let's prime our eyelids okay
you guys have no idea how much coffee I
have consumed today anyway I primed my
eyes with Mac's painterly paint-pot
grabbing a fluffy brush I'm going to dip
it into the color caramel I keep looking
off to the sides because I'm watching
the office but anyway I'm just going to
use this as my transition shade oh my
god get it together Kathleen I'm not do
your daddy behind me and on the Xbox
anyway this is a hot mess all of us okay
grabbing Morocco I'm gonna take this on
a flat shader brush this is from Mac and
I'm going to apply this to my entire
lids
taking it up to the crease
then I'm going to take my Mac 217 dip it
back into the caramel color that is the
first color we use and I'm just going to
blend these two together then on a
fluffy brush I'm going to dip it into
caramel again and then buff everything
out I really love that caramel oh my
goodness I really love that caramel
color and I want it to just be
everywhere in my crease like very very
smoky and blown out I'm going to dip it
right back into Morocco this flat shader
brush and apply it on my lips again just
in case any of it got blended away from
Zee blending then I'm going to go into
this color right here called legend and
on this makeup brush I'm going to use it
as my brow bone highlight and my inner
corner palette
now I'm going to go into this color
called deep plum and on a Mac 217 I'm
just gonna deepen out the outer V of my
eye which is why I'm fast-forwarding it
because I am just dipping my brush into
that product and applying it little by
little just to the outer corners of the
eye to deepen up the outer corners of it
and give it a little bit more of that
smoky dimension seriously I've seen the
office this episode of The Office that
I'm watching right now like a million
times and so I can't do too many things
at once anyway once that's done I'm just
gonna dip my flat shader brush right
back into Morocco once again and then
just have everything that blends it out
I'm just blending just blending it with
that deep plum shade going into my
Maybelline master drama eyeliner and
looking like a crazy person I'm going to
tightline and add this to my waterline I
look crazy because I don't want to tug
at my eyelids so I'm taking my Kat Von D
liquid liner in trooper and I'm not
going to do it winged I'm just gonna add
a little bit of a line really close to
my lashes just like to look like a sick
little eyeliner not thick thin eyeliner
okay too much coffee and one
I'm going to take my mac and extreme
dimension and apply that to my eyelashes
now I'm going to move on to my face
before I go back to the eyes I'm going
to use the benefits Porefessional apply
that to where my pores are most
noticeable and then I'm using my
Bourjois healthy mix serum and applying
this to my face this is in the shade 53
and yes for some reason I always smell
my foundation when I'm applying it does
anybody else do that I always do that
even though I've smelled it like a
million times I'm constantly smelling my
foundation whyatt while I apply it this
is a makeup geek stippling brush
stippling brush I think it's called then
I went on to concealer and forgot to
show you I'm using my NARS radiant
creamy concealer I've had this sitting
in my drawer for months and I barely
touch it because I like my Pitney I
think it's just a good and it's so much
cheaper but I decided to bust it out
because it was expensive so I need to
use it and I also am mixing it with my
la girl pro conceal I don't know the
name of these colors I think it's
natural yes this is in the shade natural
and I'm going to mix the two colors and
then I'm going to blend it out with my
Real Techniques contour brush
then I'm just going to set that with my
mac emphasized powder I forgot to show a
clip of me holes and Max emphasized
powder but that's what I'm using to set
my under eye concealer and now we are
going to finish off the eyes I'm going
to go into this color calls Morocco and
on a tiny little brush like this this is
from Coastal Scents I'm going to apply
this really really close to my waterline
and I'm going to drag it all the way in
to my inner corner as well then I'm
going to take caramel and on a pencil
brush I'm just going to buff that out
and blend it and make it look nice and
smoky
now I'm going to go into this color
right here called deep plum and I'm only
going to apply this to the outer portion
of my eye just so it can look a little
bit deeper in that section so I'm
focusing it right here then I'm going to
apply some mascara this is just a little
tart sample I got and we're going to
finish off my face I'm using my NARS
Laguna bronzer crying because I've hit
pan there are so many girls on YouTube
who like enjoy hitting pan on products
but I do not enjoy hitting pan on a $40
bronzer it's not my favorite thing in
the world so yeah I'm just gonna go
ahead and bronze the little contours a
little bronze thing you know you know
the deal
oh my god I'm so hyper I'm going to take
this little tart drop stop watching the
office I'm going to take this Tarte
bronzer it's Park Avenue princess
it's the shimmery one and I'm going to
kind of use this as a blush because I
want it to be really really warm and
bronzy on my cheeks I kind of like how
it looks with like a really deep reds
and the warm oranges on my eyes I like
like the shimmery bronzer cheeks and
then Danny is like are you so filming a
video and then he left
like let's get out yes I am and yeah
moving on to highlight this is my
mary-lou manizer from the balm and it is
the bump love this highlight if you guys
like my nail polish rack do you see it
back there like hiding in the corner on
the right side of the screen yeah I'm
waiting for Danny to put it up on my
wall like it's when my nail polish is
there yeah
sited for my lips I'm going to take
Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick in smoked
peach and I'm only going to dab this on
because I don't want too much color
payoff and then I'm going to take this
Milani lip gloss I can't remember the
name but it will be in the description

top and then that completes this makeup
