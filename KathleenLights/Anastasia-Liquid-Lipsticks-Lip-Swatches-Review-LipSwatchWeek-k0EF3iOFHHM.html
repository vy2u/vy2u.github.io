you
hey guys welcome back to lips watch week
is day two Tuesday flips watch week and
obviously as you already know because
you've already seen the majority of this
video I was lips watching the Anastasia
Anastacio I know that I say wrong I say
Anastasia but a Nastasia just doesn't
roll off my tongue
so the anesthesia what are these called
specifically liquid lipsticks I of
course don't have the whole collection
but I purchased these six myself and I
do want to quickly talk about these
because even though I really love them
there are a couple things about them
that I don't like and I want to share
them with you so liquid lipsticks are
like all the rage right now every
company is coming out with them and I'm
not gonna lie it lip swatch week
contains a lot of liquid lipsticks just
because that's what's in right now if
you guys want me to do lip swatch week
more often then maybe I won't include
liquid lipsticks next time I do this but
anyway there are my newest obsession and
I have become like addicted to buying
them and seeing which brand has best
ones
so my all-time favorite liquid lipsticks
in the history of the world are the girl
lactic lip paints they're my favorite
because they're really really soft on
the lips they don't dry my lips out
they're super super soft yet they're
very long-lasting most liquid lipsticks
are going to be long-lasting so those
are my favorite ones the line prime ones
are really great as well but they are a
little bit drying now the formula on
these are a little bit different from
the line prime ones if you're familiar
with those this goes on like a cream
it's not like super liquidy although it
is liquidy it goes on more creamy than
anything like it has like a thicker
creamier moosie texture it's not just
straight like liquid which is good
because it doesn't dry out your lips
like these are not hydrating or
moisturizing because they are like a
matte liquid lipsticks those are always
going to be a little drying but they're
not as drying as a lot of different
companies because of the texture and the
way it goes on it's like very very
smooth and very soft to the touch it's
not going to suck all the moisture out
of your lips
now I guess because of that fact these
don't last as long as I thought they
would to be completely honest with you
they're not super long wearing out of
all the liquid lipsticks I own these are
the least well these last the least
amount of time I wore vintage when I met
color pop like when I met with color pop
I wore this and I was at color pop for
about two hours or three hours and then
we went out to lunch and when I was
eating lunch like it ended up coming
down to here and it was kind of like
crumbling and just like went away like I
like lost all of it when I was eating it
only stayed like right at the outer rim
most of this was like completely gone so
I was very shocked like a lot of my
other ones last at least seven hours at
least six or seven hours this I got like
four hours out of it so I mean that kind
of sucks this is definitely something
that I would recommend taking with you
in your purse to touch-up and for me
that's a big bummer because I like
liquid lipsticks so that I don't have to
touch up throughout the day but
definitely with these they don't last as
long but they are a little bit more like
moisturizing than other ones
so I mean you given you get I guess
another thing is that sometimes these
can wear a little weird especially pure
Hollywood this is the one that I was
most excited for and after about an hour
like just an hour wearing this I get
that really gross crustiness right in
the center here you know like that white
line I get that big time with pure
Hollywood not so much with the other
colors but with the lighter ones like
lovely gives it to me a little bit but
pure Hollywood I really get that
crustiness right up in there they smell
really nice they smell like mac
prolongwear concealer I mean they smell
decent vintage looks a lot darker on me
than it looks in the tube and vamp is a
lot vampire on my lips than it looks in
the tube and I get though I get that
question in real life as well like hey
what do you have on your lips and when I
tell them they're like I have that but
it looks darker on you like I always get
that so just keep that in mind but
besides that little step back a bit
getting a little crusty on the inside
well this one does and not lasting as
long I really like them they're really
there aren't my favorite liquid lipstick
on the market but they're really good
and she has a ton of colors and also
another really cool thing because
they're kind of creamy like because they
have kind of like a creamy texture to
them I can I mix them and they are
really good for mixing for example like
I just put some on the back of my hand
like put this one right here I'll just
show you I'll put some on the back of my
hand this is pure Hollywood it's
actually what I have on my lips right
now I have a combination of pure
Hollywood and vamp mixed together so I
put actually I put a little bit less
pure Hollywood boat over so I put your
Hollywood and rap on the back of my hand
and then I grabbed a lip brush and I
mixed them together and it created this
really pretty like dark mauve shade and
then I applied it to my lips like that
because they don't dry as fast as Lime
Crime does since the texture is a little
creamier they don't dry that fast so I
actually prefer that so I like to mix my
colors you can get a bunch of different
colors you know they're like mixable and
stuff so that's something that I really
like that I don't see a lot in the other
brands so I mean that's good so yeah
that is everything I have to say about
them thank you so much for watching and
