tutorial using the Anasazi Modern
Renaissance palette it's the look I'm
wearing right now I am using two other
eyeshadows that are not in this palette
because I wanted like a deeper purple
ear shadow and then like an orange
e-gold
I really like how it turned out my
falsies look terrible so I'm so sorry in
the close-ups here like ill your lashes
look horrible they really really do it's
just I have reused these specific lashes
too many times like it was definitely
time to throw them away but I popped
them on anyway so they were kind of
harder to put on and they just look a
hot mess but anyway I really like how
this look turned out besides that I love
how it pairs with this lip I really like
it so if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching so I'm
starting off this look with priming my
eyes as usual this is the Urban Decay
primer potion in enigma and jumping into
the UH Nastasia modern renaissance
palette I'm taking temporada I'm just
using this to set down the primer and
then I'm going into raw Sienna and I'm
using this shadow as my crease shade I'm
taking this on a sigma brush it's efore
tee and I am just buffing this into my
crease
little by little just intensifying the
color as I go now I'm going to take
burnt orange I love this shade it's kind
of like raw Sienna but a little bit more
orange and I'm using this on is another
Sigma brush this is the e30 5 and I am
just doing the exact same thing but
adding a little bit more color then I'm
going to take red ochre I think this is
one of my favorite shades in the palette
for sure and I'm using a brush from the
brand Jiu vias place it's their J 1 to 7
precision brush it's kind of like a very
thin crease brush and I'm just packing
this on the outer corners and then
dragging it into my crease and then I'm
packing it on the inner corner as well
I'm going to leave my lid bare in the
center so that I can apply the gold
shadow there
but after I do that I'm gonna go into
burnt-orange again on another fluffy
brush I don't know why I'm using so many
different crease brushes but this is the
Luxy 205 brush and I'm just using that
to blend out the edges of red ochre and
then with another brush this is the
zoeva 2 to 4 brush i'm just using the
shade love-letter to blend out the edges
now I'm going to go in with a purple
eyeshadow this is makeup forever m92 8 I
believe and I'm doing the same thing I
did with red ochre I'm applying a little
bit on the outer corners and in the
inner part as well I wanted something a
little bit more purpley red instead of
just red if that makes sense
so now I'm taking the color pop super
shock shadow in the shade kathleenlights
this is one of the colors I created with
the where the light is quad and I'm just
adding that to the center and then I'm
taking raw Sienna on a fluffy blending
brush again and just blending out the
edges lots and lots of blending I'm
going to go back in with tempera and I'm
using this as my brow bone highlight I
love this underneath the brow bone oh my
gosh excuse my brows I need to get them
done but anyway going back into red over
I'm just intensifying the colors and I'm
also blending this color in with
kathleenlights because I don't want any
harsh edges so I want to make sure the
red blends in nicely with the gold so
that's what I'm doing there and then I
went back in with the kathleenlights
shade just to intensify the gold I'm
going to skip to my face before I finish
off the eyes I'm using the glossy a
priming moisturizer to prime my skin and
to moisturize and then I went in with
the L'Oreal infallible Pro glow
foundation I'm in the shade 203 and I
have mixed feelings on this foundation I
like that at last and I like that it
doesn't feel like super greasy and do a
on the skin but it still gives me a glow
but at the end of the day it kind of
clings to my dry patches I have to work
with it a little bit more but I'm still
testing it out for concealer this is
something that I do truly truly love
this is the Born This Way concealer by
Too Faced I love the consistency of this
I'm using this to kind of amassed my
dark circles and to also highlight the
other points of my face
and then I'm just blending everything in
with this pure sponge this is from the
brand pure I love this sponge I've
talked about it before so yeah just
blending all that in and that's my
weenie go back there smelling my
lipsticks I'm doing I don't know what
she's doing but yeah moving on so I'm
going to take my cosmetics bye bye pores
pressed powder and I'm using this on my
pores because I find that this
foundation kind of sinks into my pores a
little bit like they emphasize it
emphasizes my pores a little bit more
than I want it to so I'm setting my
concealer and masking those pores as
well now to finish off the eyes I'm
going in with the NYX toy Julie gel
black eyeliner this is in the shade
pitch black I'm using this to line my
waterline and to tight line as well and
then I'm going to go in with burnt
orange on a pencil brush and I'm gonna
smoke my lower lash line now I'm using
pretty much the same shadows I used on
my lid just to smoke out the lash line
so first burnt or burnt burnt orange and
then I'm taking red ochre and doing the
exact same thing this pencil brush is my
all-time favorite it's the morphe 36 and
I'm also taking that make up forever
shadow on that same brush and doing the
same thing I think this brush might be
getting discontinued and I don't
understand why but anyway moving on to
mascara I'm using the flower beauty zoom
in mascara and then I'm gonna highlight
my inner corners I'm mixing these two
shades primavera and tempura tempura to
add to my inner corners and I popped on
some falsies these are the Camellia
lashes by kiss and to contour my face
slash bronze I didn't really do like
heavy contouring it was more like
bronzing up the skin I'm using my NARS
Laguna bronzer one of my favorite
bronzers of all time
and then I went in with this magical
beautiful delicious blush this is from
sleek makeup and it's in the shade of
suede and then to highlight the tops of
my cheekbones I'm actually taking an
eyeshadow trio this is a baked eyeshadow
trio by the brand J Kat it's in the
shade dude say the later and I have been
loving this to highlight my face I took
off my headbands and judged my hair up a
little bit and then I'm gonna go in with
my lip color this is the Ashtyn liquid
lipstick by Anastasia Beverly Hills and
that completes this makeup look I really
