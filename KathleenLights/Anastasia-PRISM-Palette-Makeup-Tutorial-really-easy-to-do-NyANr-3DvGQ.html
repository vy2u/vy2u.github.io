tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I am using the anastasia prism
palette i did a poll on twitter asked
you guys if you wanted to see tutorial
using this one or this one and 59% of
you said Anastacio prism and 41% of you
said huda beauty so i mean considering
how many of you guys said you really
wanted hooter as well let me know in the
comments below if you still want a
tutorial on this look on this palette
this is a limited edition palette from
Anastasia I'm not exactly sure how long
it's gonna be available but I really
like this one at first when I looked at
it I was like what am I gonna do with
all of that but you can get so many
looks with this natural looks crazy
looks I mean it's a very diverse palette
really really interesting the colors are
very pigmented I really like this
palette a lot more than I thought I was
gonna like it and so I created this
really easy makeup tutorial if you're
someone who doesn't know how to do wings
liner or you just can't apply falsies to
save your life you're gonna love this
look it is extremely easy to recreate I
love how this look turned out it's very
colorful but wearable at the same time
I'm perfect for this time of year I will
say guys I don't know if you hear like
the constant beeping in the back there's
still a ton of construction going on in
my house I feel like I have been under
construction since I moved into this
house but there's still a lot of noise
in the background so if this video goes
in and out of voiceover you know why but
yes anyway if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep on watching
okay so the first thing we're gonna do
is ignore these eyebrows my eyes are
already primed all I did was apply some
concealer to prime them and then I
applied a translucent powder on top to
set it so the first color we're going to
be using in the palette is the shade
Eden right here and I'm gonna take a
fluffy brush this one is from NARS any
fluffy crease brush will work and I'm
gonna start building this color into
Mike
I'm gonna start off slow but I'm really
gonna build this color up I want my
crease to be very be she obviously
okay so now I'm gonna apply this shade
to my entire lid and I'm gonna use my
finger for this I'm using this eyeshadow
as a base because I am gonna go over it
with another eyeshadow obviously but
this is just gonna help the eyeshadow I
put on top be a little bit deeper and
it's gonna give it kind of like a green
tint a lot of this eyeshadow will be
blended away you'll see in a second when
I start blending everything but that's
fine it's not gonna be a big deal okay
so now I'm gonna take the shade pyramid
and this is what I'm gonna use directly
on the top of the other eyeshadow and
I'm gonna use my finger again with this
I just feel like what I'm gonna put
something on my entire lid my best tool
is my finger it just applies the product
with the most color payoff okay now I'm
gonna go in with this shade Saturn it's
very similar to Eden but it's a bit
deeper a little more orange II and with
this elf brush I don't know the name of
it but this is what it looks like it
kind of reminds me of a Mac 217 I'm
gonna take this shade and I'm gonna
start buffing this into my crease this
is really gonna help blend out the harsh
edges and also give a super intense like
peachy orange vibe to the whole look
which I really love how that looks
against that greenie goals and then I'm
just going to keep applying this color
until I have the desired intensity
I'm going to go back into Eden which is
the first shade we used in the crease
I'm just going to blend everything out
then I'm taking my finger I'm gonna go
back into pyramid and I'm just gonna
apply some more of this because a lot of
it did get blended away when I was using
that Saturn shade I will most likely
apply some more of that at the end but
now I'm going to take the shade parallel
right here it's a nice chocolatey Brown
and on a different brush a brush that
looks similar but it's different
this one's from Real Techniques it's
also similar to a Mac 217 but it's a bit
skinnier not as fluffy and I'm gonna
start applying this color right in the
outer corners and into the crease a
little bit and this is just gonna deepen
up the look and make it a little bit
more smoky
I'm going back in with my ELF brush that
had the Saturn sheet on it but I'm not
adding any more Saturn I'm just blending
out the edges of this I'm gonna take the
black shade it's called obsidian and on
a tiny little brush this one's from
Julius place I'm just gonna start adding
this color right on the outer corners
here extremely close to my lashline I
kind of want to create a winged liner
effect and I'm not dragging this color
all the way in I don't want it to look
like I have eyeliner all the way into my
inner corners so I'm just focusing this
right on the outer corners where the
brown eye shadow is alright now I'm
gonna take a makeup wipe and clean up
all this fallout actually no you know
apply some more pyramid I'm gonna take
my pinky this time so it's more precise
in the inner corners here
that is good to go now I'm gonna go in
with a makeup boy and I'm gonna clean up
all this follow and then we're gonna
move on to the face okay so I completely
forgot to do this so I just did a really
quick off camera but the prism palette
doesn't really have a brow bone shade
for me you have this one in unity but
this is pretty much like the exact color
of my skin tone almost so it doesn't
really highlight the brow bone from my
skintone I'm sure if you have a deeper
skin tone that would be perfect but I
took the Anasazi eyeshadow in bone and
that's what I use ty light my brow bone
today to prime my skin I'm going in with
the Beca first light priming filter one
of my favorite primers and I hadn't used
it for a while so I'm popping this on my
face and then for some added hydration
I'm gonna take the pixie glow mist and
I'm gonna spray that stuck on my face
now I'm gonna go in with foundation I'm
gonna take two foundations today I'm
gonna be mixing these ua essential high
coverage cream foundation in fawn with
the huda beauty foundation in shortbread
this one is too light for me I recently
hauled creme brulee and then I got
shortbread like a nerd because this is
also too late for me like I don't know
why it's just so many shades are sold
out I just need to relax go into Sephora
and actually try it out for myself
because ordering online is becoming a
mission my friends love it when I order
a line because I give them all the stuff
that doesn't fit me but I'm just gonna
mix these two colors together I think by
mixing them I'm gonna get a pretty good
color the only thing is that this gooey
foundation is so high coverage so is
this one so I'm just gonna take a little
bit of each and then I'm gonna mix it
together I think this is gonna make a
pretty good shade for me I'm actually
gonna blend this in with my new love is
the foundation brush from it cosmetics
you guys know I just recently picked up
a brand new one this was limited edition
and the original is like my favorite
foundation brush of all time so I'm so
glad they brought it back I will say
it's pretty much identical it's almost
the exact same brush but it is a little
bit different I swear it
a little bit different I feel like the
bristles are a little bit longer I don't
know
to cover up them dark circles I'm going
in with my tart shape tape concealer and
I am buffing that into the skin with
this Ecotools brush
to set my concealer down I'm gonna take
my Kat Von D blotting no way yes yes
this is the blotting powder in light and
I love it it's amazing I'm pretty much
gonna put this everywhere all right so
to complete the eyes before we finish up
the face I'm gonna take the shade eat in
on my elf eyes shading brush and I'm
gonna take this color very lightly on my
lower lash line all the way across
then I'm gonna take the shade a throne
it's a really pretty like green
turquoise blue shimmer and on a little
pencil brush this is the liner smudge
brush from Ecotools I'm gonna run that
across my entire eye creating a really
bold liner on the lower lash line isn't
it weird when you see eyeshadow on your
actual eyeball like when you're blending
on the lower lash line and it gets in
the eyeball and you're like that can't
be good
I'm going to take my Urban Decay
eyeliner in the shade main line
this is almost the exact shade as thrown
only this is matte and thrown a shimmery
I'm gonna go back into this elf brush
and I'm gonna go back into Eden I'm
gonna blend out some of that throwing
shade I want a little bit of this Eden
color to peak through right underneath
and then I'm gonna take this shape loose
it on my pinky because this eyeshadow is
a little crumbly so the best way to
apply it is with your finger and I'm
gonna pop that right on my inner corners
now I'm just gonna pop on some Marc
Jacobs mascara this is the velvet noir
mascara I'm trying to go through all my
mascaras here so I'm like using all of
them and yeah then we can go ahead and
finish the face I'm gonna contour my
face using the cover FX bronzer in the
shade Sun Tan and I'm really gonna
chisel out the cheeks with this bronzer
I wanted to add some warmth and bronze
eNOS to the look so I took this Javan
Chi bronzer it's called the healthy glow
powder and this is in the shade number 4
and I'm just popping this all over my
face just to give myself like I said a
little bit more warmth and brilliance
evening for blush I'm going in with the
urban decay afterglow 8 hour blush in
the shade and decent this is like a
light peachy shade it's not very
pigmented I kind of have to build it up
a lot and then for my highlight I'm
going in with the gimme more
highlighting palette from colour-pop and
I'm taking this shade right here and I
am popping that on my cheeks and on the
nose and other places I like to
highlight
for lips i'm going to take my charlotte
tilbury lip cheat lip liner in iconic
nude Oh bliss Walker
this lip liner it looks so dark on me
like I look so light on everybody else I
don't but I like it I like it though I
kind of like how this looks by itself
actually on top of that I'm gonna go in
with the cap on the liquid lipstick in
Hawkwind
I don't know if it's the lipliner or if
it's the actual liquid lipstick but this
color is a little bit patchy I'm not
sure if you can tell but regardless it's
I mean it's not terrible I really like
how this looks turned out and I really
like it with this lip it's very fallish
so yeah guys that completes this video I
