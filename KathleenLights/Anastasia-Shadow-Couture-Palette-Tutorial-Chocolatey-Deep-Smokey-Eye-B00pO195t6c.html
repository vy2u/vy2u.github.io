a makeup tutorial on the makeup I'm
wearing this is using the Anastasia
shadow Couture palette this is what it
looks like
I of course kept it to the very warm
eyes shadows in this palette I really
really loved this look I actually didn't
get a day when I was just getting ready
and I post them on snapchat like wow I
really like how it turned out I should
have filmed this tutorial and it got
super requested after that I posted a
picture of me wearing it on Instagram
and pretty much everyone commented
please do a tutorial on this look so
that is what I'm doing right now I love
it when I musashi Estelle's
palettes like this because you get a ton
of eyeshadows and they're like $35 I
think so it's really good it's a lot of
bang for your buck and the quality of
the eyeshadows are really nice I really
really love this palette it's probably
my favorite one so far just because I
just love these warm colors but then you
have pops of color down here as well it
is a little bit different than the look
I posted on Instagram I made it just a
little darker a little bit more Brown in
my crease and stuff like that I just
made a little bit more dramatic but I
really love this look I wasn't gonna
post it because I do so many like
chocolatey looks but it was requested
just keep that in mind if you comment
like you do looks like this all the time
it was requested okay so yeah if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep on watching eye primer of
choice today is the Mac 24 hour extended
eye base I just recently discovered this
and it's probably one of the best
eyeshadow primers I have ever used
going into the Anastacio palette I am
taking soft peach and I'm packing this
all over my entire lid just to set that
eye base we just put down now I'm going
to take a fluffy crease brush this is
from Sephora I'm going to dip my brush
into the shade Morocco and I am packing
this in my crease this is kind of like
my transition shade and I'm putting this
everywhere pretty much just slowly
dipping the color dipping the brush back
into the color and just intensifying it
going back and forth until I want it
exactly
it uh yeah how's it make sense taking
another brush I'm going into the color
fudge it's the chocolatey color in the
palette and I'm putting this all over my
entire lid bringing it right up to the
crease now I'm going to take this one
I'm pretty sure it's called Bellini it's
a really pretty peach this is just like
a random I shadow brush from Urban Decay
that I got in the electric palette but I
like it to pack on eyeshadow so I'm
putting this all over the lid on top of
that fudge color then applying fix+ to
the brush and I'm just intensifying that
color even more because adding of the
fix+ really makes this eyeshadow like a
peachy metallic finish so I wanted to
add the fix plus to intensify it then
I'm going to take a brush really similar
to the Mac 217 it's like a tapered
crease brush and I'm a ticket i'ma
taking the fudge color and I'm putting
this directly into my crease I don't
want it as sloppily as the Morocco shade
I want to make sure that that Brown
stays focused in the outer view of my
eye and in my crease as well so I'm just
slowly building that color going back
into Morocco I'm just blending
everything out so that the lines aren't
too too harsh I'm now just going to take
a white eye shadow to highlight my brow
bone since there isn't an eye shadow
light enough in the Anastacio palette
this is just a white eye shadow from a
lorac palette but use any eyeshadow you
want I dipped my brush into the shade
noir just to apply it really close to my
lashes so that it can look like I have
some eyeliner I'm just smudging it there
just for the you know effect of eyeliner
so I'm going to move on to my face
before I finish my eyes I'm taking this
tiny little sample I got from Mac it is
their strobe cream it came when like
ordered something the other day and I
loved it like I love this as a primer it
just makes my face so duly I love it now
I'm going to take my makeup ever Ultra
HD foundation and I'm applying this on
my entire face using a Marc Jacobs brush
you don't need this brush honestly
it was way too expensive but I wasn't
the one who bought it it was a present
but it's really amazing but I don't
recommend it
because it's so so pricey there's tons
of brushes that do the same thing so I'm
just applying it because you know it was
a gift from Demi huh
so I'm just using it anyway yeah so I
applied the Ultra HD foundation all over
my face I'm in why three three five it's
like more of my Tanner shade but we're
making it work so I'm using the
maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser this is in the shade of
fair and I'm using this underneath my
eyes to cover up some dark circles and
to highlight my face but to further
highlight I'm taking the Mac prep and
prime pen in yeah wipe that off your
nose and I'm using um what is it's
called what is light boost it's the
yellow one and I'm using this to
highlight on the rest of my face and I
added a little bit more to the under eye
area just to further brighten and then
I'm just blending that in but I'm not
using a Sedona lace brush surprise I
know but my sudden Elise brush was
really really dirty so I just used this
one for more feet it's not as good but I
got the job done you know so yes just I
just blended that in you've seen me
blend in my concealer about a million
times
but yes alright I'm setting my under eye
concealer using this NYX HD powder in
the shade banana it's like the yellowy
powder I love it I've been using it a
lot and I really love it so I'm using an
elf tapered blush to just blush tell elf
tapered brush to set my concealer I'm
setting every where I put that concealer
all right so let's finish these eyes I'm
taking this flat sort of brush by Sigma
and I'm taking fudge and I'm applying it
really close to my lower lashes and then
I'm going to take noir and do the same
thing but on the outer corners I'm not
dragging it all the way in like I did
with fudge and then I'm just going to
take Morocco and blend everything out
with a pencil brush smudge it real good
make sure everything is nice blended and
a smoky so now for mascara I'm using my
L'Oreal telescopic and I was like woah
did I break it but no it was just a
packaging malfunction this is the
telescopic carbon black and I am just
coating my top and bottom lashes with
this you can do falsies but I just
decided to skip it then I'm going to
take this pencil brush and I applied mac
fix+ to it and I'm going to dip this
brush into the pink champagne color
adding fix pluses to this eye shadow
intensifies it by like a million it
makes it super foiled and metallic so
I'm applying this to my inner corners to
create a nice metallic pinky inner
corner so this is the Laura Geller baked
bronzer and medium and it looks so dark
I was really scared the first time I
used it but I'm using this Real
Techniques multi-task brush and if I
focus my brush on the more whitish part
of the bronzer I actually really love
the bronzer it blends really nicely
because it's a baked product but it just
looks so nice so I'm only using a little
bit to warm up my skin I'm not trying to
contour or anything just adding a little
bit of color to my face
all right for blush I'm using Mac warm
soul because it just goes so well with
this eyeshadow look I love this blush
it's so beautiful and yeah that's what
I'm applying to my cheeks and when I
posted this picture on Instagram I was
using the Jacqueline Hill champagne pop
Becca highlight but I decided to use
something different so I'm just I went
with the hard candy baked bronzer in
Tiki and I'm applying this to my to the
tops of my cheekbones and on my nose
just to highlight my face because I love
to highlight alright for lips i'm using
this ofra liquid lipstick in the shade
so Paolo I don't know how to say that so
Paolo it's such a beautiful nude it's
like amazing these liquid lipsticks are
one of the best liquid lipsticks I have
ever used
seriously stunning I love them I highly
recommend them so after that I'm
applying this Marc Jacobs lip gloss and
sugar sugar right on top and then I
wanted my look to be a little bit more
dewy so I took this Josie Maran Nirvana
hydrating treatment mist and I applied
it to my skin this isn't a setting spray
it's more of a treatment but I like how
it makes my makeup look so yes that
completes this look thank you guys so
