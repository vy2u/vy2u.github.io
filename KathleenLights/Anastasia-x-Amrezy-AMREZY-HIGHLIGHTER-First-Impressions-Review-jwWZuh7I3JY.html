exciting one I am so excited I actually
had a completely different video plan to
go up today it was the color pop looks
lipstick lip swatch video was gonna film
that now but then this came in the mail
and I just had I had to change my plans
but don't worry I'm still gonna do that
video for you guys it should be coming
up on Monday I haven't filmed it just
yet but you should be coming soon but I
posted this on IG stories like 20
minutes ago and I asked you guys if you
wanted her first impressions and so many
of you guys said yes look who came in
the mail I almost couldn't contain
myself
so if you guys didn't know anastacio
Beverly Hills a BH has collabed once
again with amrezy but this time it's
it's even more special I think the last
time they collabs it was on an eyeshadow
palette and it was such a long time ago
but now I'm raising has created her own
highlight which is a big deal because I
really love the a BH highlights a lot of
them are different formulas like they
have different finishes and stuff I love
a BH in general I think there's such a
good brand and when I saw that they were
collabing with them Reesie I got so
excited I know you're thinking like wow
that's a huge PR box for a highlight but
look at these magic well and they beauty
I know this doesn't release for a while
the official launch date is on
Valentine's Day releases February 14th
but I really wanted to get this video up
for you guys so many of you were asking
me and I want to give you guys my first
impressions I haven't even tried this on
at all and I wanted to give you guys my
thoughts before it released maybe some
of you have my skin tone or maybe you
just want to know what I think so that's
what we're doing today this is so
stunning look at a highlight oh honey it
is so quite I know it's a PR box so I'm
pretty sure you cannot get it but I'm
not sure if you can get the mirror and
the phone case is on on its own I'm not
sure if a mate just selling these on
their website but look how pretty you
get two phone cases like one for the
plus and one for the regular iPhone I
think that's really cool one I really
like this mirror as well it's just like
a standard mirror I know but it's so
cute I like that it's black its sleek it
says I'm reezy and I'm just really
really excited because I actually
consider myself like an I'm raise even I
do fangirl over her I remember the first
time that I ever saw her in person it
was that I'm at
and I was like and the reason I'd like
her so much is because she she's like a
boss I love that she's not afraid to
tell you how it is but at the same time
she doesn't involve herself in any drama
like she's not problematic at all at all
sorry I just took out my Invisalign and
now I find it like really weird to talk
and I stutter all the time now it's just
strange but anyway she keeps to herself
and she does her own thing and if you
piss her off then she'll go off but if
you don't she's so cool and I love that
about her I love how confident she is I
love how she's just like not scared but
at the same time she just seems like so
down to earth and minds her own business
and does her own thing and works on her
own hustle and I just I love that and I
appreciate that and she inspires me she
really really does so when I saw that
this was happening I was all about it
I'm all over it I'm here to tell you
guys how I feel about it and I'm not
gonna be biased even though I love I'm
racy if this sucks I'm gonna tell you
but I doubt it's gonna suck because I'm
Reese's like the queen of highlighting
you know so let me stop sounding crazy
and let me get into this video I'm gonna
pull my hair back a little bit just so
we get the full effect okay so this is
what the beautiful highlight looks like
on the outside this is the packaging I
love the packaging on this it's so sleek
and beautiful I love how the bottom has
gold like a rose gold and I love the
stars on the top I just I so sleek and
nice and glamorous at the same time so
I'm all about this packaging and then
when you open it look at how beautiful
this looks like not just the color the
color does look like a very beautiful
gold but the way it looks is so stunning
as well it looks like like a sand dune
or something like the desert I don't
know I really love the print on this
it's like wavy I just like I want to
look at it and the mirror on this is
really awesome as well so if you want to
highlight on the go you could do that
basically I like the packaging I like
the look of it it's very nice okay so
we're zoomed in I'm actually gonna be
using two different highlighting brushes
in this video because I'm not sure how
this formula works I mean it feels like
one of those jelly kind of highlights
where they don't feel powdery when you
put your finger and it almost feels like
plasticy so I don't know which brush I'm
gonna prefer this is the Ecotools
controlled setting brush I love using
this to highlight and then I
so really like using the colour-pop
small fluff brush this one just really
packs on the color so I'm gonna do one
on one side and one on the other and I'm
also gonna put this on my inner corners
and all over the place I'm not exactly
sure if your need like a light hand with
this or what because like I said first
impressions for me or a little awkward
but anyway you can see look it's like
one of those formulas I'm like really
digging in here and there's absolutely
no fallout so it's not powdery at all
it's a different type of formula oh my
gosh that is beautiful I was actually
really worried that it was gonna be a
little bit too deep on me because if I'm
not careful golden highlights will just
look like a stripe on my face like you
can kind of tell that it is a little bit
deep on me I can still kind of get away
with it you know it's such a beautiful
lick from within
two coats makes it more intense all
right I'm gonna do this side with my
color pump one I feel like I'm gonna
like my color pop one more it's gonna
apply it like more of a BAM this brush
just picks up a lot of product yes yes
certain highlights look great with this
brush like I still think this looks
great but this brush just really really
packs it on I'm gonna put some more on
this egg this is gonna look so nice in
the summer with a tan hmm and you know
what this isn't a highlight that's like
unnatural like you could totally wear
this during the day you know how I feel
about glittery chunky highlights I hate
them and I feel like this doesn't give
you any chunkiness any glitter it's just
like a really pretty sheen on the skin I
love the formula on this highlight it is
so nice it is just a hair too deep for
me like you can kind of see it but I'm
still gonna wear it because I freaking
love it and they would probably blend in
really nicely with a blush I don't have
any blush on right now so I'm gonna add
a little bit to my nose
my nose my Cupid's I'm also gonna add a
little bit of this on my brow bone I
have my dream Street palette on my eyes
today so I have Mooney as my brow bone
highlight but I'm just gonna add this I
could just imagine how this applies wet
this might be a really great highlighter
to apply wet since the formula doesn't
feel like regular powder I feel like it
would work well if you wet it let me try
I'm gonna take my morphe setting spray
and pick some up here on the very corner
holy guacamole
this is so beautiful I really like this
color I'm gonna take this one step
further I'm just gonna take a fluffy
brush and just dust this on the eyes
so I'm pretty much done I think I've
highlighted all the places I could
highlight I'm going to apply some
setting spray all over my face just to
melt everything in and then I will give
you my final box
okay so obviously I think this highlight
is amazing I feel like you can really
build this product up if you want a
super intense extreme glow you can
totally do that with this highlight but
if you want something really natural you
can do that with this as well like with
this little Ecotools brush if you just
apply a light hand you get a really soft
golden sheen to the skin
I'm also completely in love with this
shade it is gold but there's something
special about it it's also not too gold
it's not too yellow some golden
highlights just don't look that good on
my skin this is a very wearable
champagne gold I also think it's a
pretty universal shade it has a super
flattering undertone I really really
like this I'm raising it it's such a
good job I love the pattern I love this
I love the design I really love the
formula as well it retails for $28 and I
personally think it is totally worth $28
it has point 31 ounces 9 grams you will
not go through this product very easily
like you will have this for a very long
time I think it's totally worth the
investment so that is my first
impressions I say get it mark it down on
your calendar February 14th you need
this it is so incredibly beautiful yeah
