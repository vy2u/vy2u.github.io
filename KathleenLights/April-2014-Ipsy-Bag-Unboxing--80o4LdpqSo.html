doesn't match your chest yes it does
business it's the lighting do you see
this weird shadow I don't know how to
get rid of it I really don't know how to
get rid of that shadow oh hey guys so
today's video is my monthly itse bag and
boxing I got so many comments asking me
if I was going to do an Ipsy bag
unboxing this month and yes I am for
some reason it got to my house a little
later than it usually does but yes carry
on filming it and guys as long as I'd be
getting them I'd be filming them don't
you worry so let's rip this baby open so
this is what the bag looks like this
month it's really different from the
bags we are used to getting it is square
instead of rectangle well almost forgot
the shape frozen and it's actually
pretty cute I kind of expected something
like really springy since it's April but
it works for me I like it so the first
thing I see here is something that I'm
really excited about because I'm pretty
sure everybody got this in their bag
this month and it is an Urban Decay 24/7
velvet the light on I pencil this isn't
a full sizes yeah no this isn't a full
size but it's actually a pretty big size
if you ask me like usually their
eyeliner samples are like this big like
the ones you get in the mail the samples
or whatever but this is pretty large I'm
actually very impressed with the size
that they gave us and this is in the
color black velvet and I've actually
heard a lot of good things about this
velvet eyeliner that they came out with
it goes on very very creamy and it is
pretty black and it is very easy to
blend out this would be so cool for like
a smudgy smokey eye so yeah I'm really
excited about this the full-sized
versions of these are $20 which is
pretty expensive for an eyeliner and I
think this is a pretty decent size so oh
and it says here on the packaging that
it's supposed to be waterproof and not
budge that's going to set and stay in
place so hopefully that's true because
it is a little creamy so I'm a little
worried if it's gonna be like too smudgy
if you don't I mean the next
the bag is the color that nobody reads I
got a dr. Brandt microdermabrasion skin
exfoliant this one it looks like it's
like a tiny little sample of it and oh
it's close obviously come on it smells
very lemony and it feels really nice
oh very lemony good God just lemony it
feels really nice I really like like
microdermabrasion exfoliators because
they're very very finely milled and they
work for my skin I have a lot of dry
flaky patches so hopefully this works on
my skin the full-sized version of this
is actually $78 so it's cool we get a
little version of this because that's
offensive
you know so the next thing I see in the
bag is this pop goes the eyeshadow
single eyeshadow and it is from
Elizabeth Mott we've got an Elizabeth
Mott products in RFC bags before I know
the it's so big mascara which is one of
my favorite mascaras is from Elizabeth
Mott
so this is exciting powerful almost
dropped back this is what the packaging
looks like it's just like little plastic
packaging and the eyeshadow is actually
very very beautiful it's not too chalky
or anything like that it's a nice decent
eyeshadow and it's perfect for all over
the lid this is in the shade champagne
and I actually do see myself reaching
for this quite a bit because it's just
one of those practical everyday
eyeshadows hopefully it lasts a good
time this obviously is a full-sized
product and these retail for $12.99
which is more than you paid for the
empty bag already just saying the next
thing in my bag is this Kaelyn
what is this what is this tinted
lip-balm in Apple pink we've got um
Kailen products in turn of teabags
before and actually really like this
packaging I know a lot of people think
it's too bulky but I really like it I
think it's cute and this is a tinted lip
balm let's see it comes with a brush up
here just like their eye liners which
you could use to dip into the lip balm
and then apply to your lips which is
pretty practical if you ask me oh crap
this is super pigmented usually when you
hear tinted lip balm you think of
something that's pretty sheer but that
is pretty pigmented if you ask me and it
is actually a really pretty color I
don't know
I'm digging this I'm doing this and
these do retail for $19 so that's pretty
expensive for a lip product and this is
obviously full size so that's amazing
Ipsy amazing the last thing in my bag is
this Saint Tropez gradual tan anti-aging
plus and I was super excited when I saw
this in my glam room just because Saint
Tropez gets so much hype and I've only
tried one product from them and I have
been wanting a gradual tanner for my
face because I used the Jergens one for
my whole body and I didn't have one for
my face so I'm excited to try this
hopefully it doesn't break me out but
who knows it says I rejuvenate your skin
giving you a sunkissed glow and a
multi-action moisturizer too so yay coz
I have dry skin let's see what this
smells like it's actually not too bad I
mean it's not a pleasant scent but
that's to be expected with tanners but
not complain and not complain and I
cannot find this exact anti-aging one on
their website but their regular gradual
tanners for their face on the full-size
are $25 so I'm sure this is around that
same price point and because it is for
your face you're not going to be rubbing
this on your entire body I actually do
think that this is a pretty decent
sample size like I think so it's pretty
it's like my hand that's pretty good
okay so that was everything I got in
this month's if Seebeck absolutely loved
every single thing in the bag I haven't
tried anything on my face yet I will in
just a minute but I think it was what
worth it the bag was worth over $40 I
think and worth every single penny since
we only paid ten I think it's a great
monthly subscription definitely check it
out if you haven't already and please
subscribe if you haven't already and
stay tuned for the swatches on my face
cuz that's what you guys like the most
anyway I'm going to be trying out the
Urban Decay black velvet eyeliner on my
waterline it's super super creamy like
that is the first thing I noticed it
does not tug on my waterline whatsoever
by the way this is my brand new Sephora
bronzer from their new collection and
review coming soon because it's freaking
amazing
it is very very pigmented I am super
impressed with this eyeliner if you are
wondering if it is waterproof like it
claims if it does stay on like a claim I
will give you an update in the
description box and tell you if it
really did stay on my waterline the
entire day so check the description box
I'm just going to put a wash of color
all over my lid using the eyeshadow that
we got in the Ipsy bag ok so it's pretty
pigmented considering that I forgot to
put primer on so this is the eyeshadow
without any primer and this is it a
little bit closer so you can kind of see
obviously this eyeshadow would look so
much better with primer underneath but
I'm so impressed it's very very natural
and wearable for everyday I think a lot
of people would get some use out of this
eyeshadow and this is the eyeliner I
think it looks pretty darn good if you
ask me I'm going to try on the Caitlin
tinted lip balm in apple pink
this is what the color looks like on me
I do not think it is a lip balm by any
means it is actually very very matte it
doesn't feel too drying but it's not the
most moisturizing lip product in the
world so I mean in the pot it looks a
lot lighter than it comes off on your
lips I think oh and I also do not enjoy
the taste at all
it smells like fake rubber okay guys so
those are the only things that I'm able
to try out on my face I hope you like
the fact that I tried them on thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
