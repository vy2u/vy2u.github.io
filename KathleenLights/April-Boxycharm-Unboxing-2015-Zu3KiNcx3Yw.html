about how I just finished watching the
most recent episode of arrow on my iPad
um and now I don't know what to do with
my life hey guys so today's video is
going to be my monthly boxycharm
unboxing this month is April's of course
because we are in April a lot of you
guys I just want to say this really
quick a lot of you guys have been asking
me like did you unsubscribe to Ipsy I
explained it in a recent video that when
I moved I forgot to update my address on
EPSA comm and yeah I just recently
updated it so um I did get my FC bag
this month so I will be doing an Ipsy in
boxing I'm sorry but anyway let's go
ahead and pop on in and open oh this
one's box so this is what the back the
box looks like this month and it just as
April Bloom and the first thing I see
immediately is this guy right here this
is it says Oprah powder derma mineral
powder paint and pink sapphire so it's
like a highlighter I'm going to assume
Oprah derma mineral powder it's a
full-size this retails for $35 and it's
like a shimmer powder yeah so this is
definitely like a highlight but I guess
in like oh yeah it's like a list powdery
highlight which I'm actually starting to
like pink highlighters a lot more than I
used to I used to be all about the gold
life but oh my god this color is this
actually I guess is like multi-purpose
you could use this on your eyes or on
your face maybe it is meant for the face
but I'm sure you can use it on your eyes
as well it's a lot of product so that's
good that's full-sized did I mention
that this is 35 bucks the next thing in
here is my nose open this is the cool
way smoothing lotion smooth manageable
healthy hair with no frizz apply as
needed to damp or dry hair I love things
that are gonna make my hair not frizzy
because my hair is frizzy so this is
what it looks like I guess the brand is
called cool way and it's just a
smoothing low
is this full-size yes it is full-size
and this is 24.95 let me feel oh did you
hear that oh it didn't do it again
sounded like a little part okay yeah I
can get down with this it just feels
like a serum so oh it smells good too
and now it's all over me oh yay okay so
next thing oh let's have a coupon here
35% off your purchase and free hair
brush on Col Wacom I think yes the promo
code is voxi for you and you get 35% off
on their website so I will leave the
promo code down below and like the cool
way website that's pretty cool
okay so the next thing in here what I
was going to show you I'm so excited
that this is in here this is a perfume
you guys know my addiction to perfume
and this is the Harvey Prince perfume in
the scent hello
excited because I'm pretty sure we've
got a Miss in our boxycharm previously
and I loved it so much and I went
through it so fast like in three weeks
and it's in a different bottle this time
and actually prefer this bottle because
that almost like a spray but this is
like a rollerball oh my god I'm obsessed
with this scent I took it with me to
California and I sprayed it all the time
I love it so this is a mini this is like
a little mini version this isn't
full-size but even this mini version is
$21 so that's a really good deal I love
this perfume I'm so excited we got it
okay so I'm gonna save the best for last
because I really like the other the last
thing that's in this box so I'm going to
go ahead and show you guys this this is
a it says dual lip pencil from vincent
longo
and i want to say that i've heard of
this brand before but at the same time i
think i'm just thinking of Melissa and
Joey because I'm pretty sure his last
name on that show is Longo
so maybe that's where I heard that so I
don't know this is the brand vincent
longo and it's a dual lip pencil you get
two lip liners in one that is so cool
one side says maple and one sized side
says spring rose this is really cool for
traveling
because you know you don't you get to
take one lip pencil and you've got to
and once that make sense this is I like
this I'm very excited and they both look
like really natural colors that I see
myself wearing maybe that's so much in
the springtime but I really like that
sighting okay and then the last thing in
here is this oh my god I'm so excited
okay so this is the revealed 2 palette
from Coastal Scents the full revealed
palette isn't that crazy
I think so I hate these lights they
drive me nuts I fixed my ring light it's
right there anyway so I'm so excited
they did send the revealed the regular
revealed palette like a couple months
ago in our boxycharm and actually I gave
it to my friend because she came over
one day and like asked me like you give
it to her and I did so I don't have that
one anymore but I can't open this this
is what I feel like the original
revealed palette is really similar to
the naked one and the naked 2 this one
is really similar to the naked 3 so I
love these colors like this one right
here ah good you die I'm not gonna demo
these cuz I have like makeup on and I'm
about to go out but let me swatch them
do you hear my dogs they're so loud let
me swatch them for you oh my god these
are very pigmented I mean I wouldn't
expect anything else but like look at
that can you see that oh I'm so excited
I like these types of colors more in the
fall honestly but I definitely see
myself using that a lot and it's so
inexpensive I haven't even been telling
you the prices have I the full this is
full size this double-sided thing and
it's $26 so obviously this is full sizes
a whole pallet and they have this on the
Coastal Scents website like listed for
39.95 this is a $40 palette but Coastal
Scents has had these pallets on sale so
it's like they came out so they're not
go they're like really not 40 bucks
there are 20 bucks like on the website
says 1995 or something so you can get
this on the website for 20 bucks which
is like what you pay for this books just
saying
so the overall value of this box is over
one hundred and thirty dollars which is
seriously insane I say it in every video
but you pay twenty one dollars a month
for full-size products and most of the
time it's like over 80 bucks every
single time so it's I don't know how
they're making money that's just let's
just put that out there
I don't know I'm very happy with the box
this month especially well I like
everything the only thing I'm not like
oh my god dying over is the is the dual
lip pencil but I haven't tried it yet
and it looks promising especially for
traveling I'm actually really really
happy with everything especially my
little perfume in my palette and this
little powder looks really beautiful so
okay I'm gonna put these on my face
around my neck in ten I'm gonna go now I
love you guys and I order is chewing can
you hear him he's chewing on my ring
light stand and that's how I break
things thing guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
