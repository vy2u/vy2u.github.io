my April black C shame backs it um I
thought I had something I tell you guys
before I got into the video but I guess
I don't I took off the lights so let's
get right on into this and open it I'm
gonna use a brush okay so let's open it
this is what the box looks like this man
ah it says Cloudy with a Chance of
charms and look guys the prices the list
of products if you guys saw my last
month's boxycharm unboxing you would
know that I was a little bit upset
because they didn't add the prices on
the back and the list but they did this
month so we're back in the game
obviously the first thing I see is this
guy cuz it's the biggest thing in the
box
this is the Enderson Lilly Beach butter
hand cream it says it has a blend of
bergamot citrus white jasmine Brazilian
heliotrope and musk though I really want
to smell this OH
obviously let's take this off first man
this is hard to squeeze
no no how I feel about that let me rub
it in first let me rub it in first I
feel like there's going to be a ton of
people who are gonna love the scent of
the tan cream and then there's gonna be
some that aren't gonna love it i wow
this feels amazing though I definitely
love the way this makes my hands feel
and I might just throw this in my purse
because my hands feel so amazing even
though I'm not a big fan of the scent I
personally like really sweet hand creams
but I know not everybody does this is a
very fresh hand cream it smells very
very clean so I know a lot of you guys
will love that
alright well Nate Beasley a white circle
yeah I think so so this is a pigment I'm
going to assume when you're in my little
guard this is from the brand called your
minerals and this is a mineral eyeshadow
oh wait I forgot I forgot so this is a
full-size hand cream obviously and this
retails for $24 this is a full-size
pigment right here and this retails for
$21 let's see what it looks like I wish
I used pigments more often because I
just I feel like they're better than
eyeshadows personally eyeshadows are
just so easy but pigments are just so
pretty
oh my gosh can you guys see that that is
beautiful I reminds me of Mac satin
taupe but like on steroids so much oh
this is gorgeous so the next thing in
the box is really exciting they have
another ofra liquid lipstick in the box
this month and this one is actually one
of my all-time favorites like if I had a
top 5 favorite Oprah liquid lipsticks
Pasadena which is this one is definitely
one that would be in that top 5 and the
full size of this is 1950 I think or 20
bucks next thing in the box is from the
spread called pur Lisse and believe
that's how you say it it's actually a
really great brand we've got in the
spread in the box before this is the
daily lip nurture with mango and shea
butter hydrates and nourishes heals and
softens petroleum-free
all skin types just looks like a cute
little tube let me see let me see this
is a full-sized product and this is $16
that's pretty expensive for a lip balm
let me feel it let me feel it oh this
feels nice and it's
smells really good I love lip balm I
feel like I really can't get enough no
matter how many lip balms I get there's
always there's always room for more I'm
actually gonna go throw this in my purse
after this video and then the last thing
in the Box this month is from the brand
blink this is their black lash primer
okay in the shade jet black I'm only
used to seeing kind of like white
primers or the Estee Lauder one isn't
white but it's like a brown color this
is a black lash primer I hate this kind
of packaging where I have to sit here
and try to rip it open
alright we're in the game mmm hmm looks
promising looks promising I could tell
by the wand looks promising I hope this
doesn't make them like waterproof
because I don't like that but it doesn't
say it will so it just says jet black
volume Oh volume I'm excited to use this
lash primer
I love lash primers this is a full-sized
product and this is 26 buckaroos so that
was everything I got in this month's
back serum and the overall value of the
box this month was over $100 and you pay
$21 a month I look boxy sure so yeah
