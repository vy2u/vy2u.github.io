mom back to Sherman boxes I can't
believe it's already April there is
above the size of Wisconsin on my
ceiling
oh my god holiday I go forget that I
don't reach I'm just gonna leave it
there until after I'm done filming this
video and then I'll handle that
situation but anyway I can't believe it
spring already I feel like it was just
Christmas last week mums are just moving
so fast these days but anyway let's open
this puppy you guys know the drill with
my buck see Sherm videos but if you
haven't seen any of my boxes Sherman
boxing's I like to try out the products
as I go along
oh and that reminds me a lot of people
keep asking me if I cancelled my Ipsy
bag no I did not cancel my Ipsy bag but
there was a situation with my debit card
and I had to get a new one
I lost the long story but I had to
cancel it and get a new one and when I
did that I completely forgot to update
my billing info on it see so I didn't
receive my bag yet well as well I fixed
it and yeah I'm waiting for my bag
but anyway videos about boxy sure so and
this is what the book looks like it has
a little card that says boho blue very
cute and then obviously the first thing
in the box was this guy I mean like
right there in my face and I am so
excited about this when I open the box
up earlier today and I saw this I was
like but if you guys watch my channel
you will know that the Pierre contour
blending sponge is one of my favorite
sponges this one the original here now
my original contour sponge doesn't have
the word pure embedded into it like
these do but I'm assuming it's the exact
same sponge I haven't tried these out
yet but I have like three backups of
this one these colors are so cute - is
taking the yellow one and you don't live
the blue my favorite thing about it is
the shape I love how it has the bottom
just like a Beauty Blender but the top
is like cut like this so you could do
your under eye you could put on your
foundation I just love this sponge so
I'm so excited we get three in the box
this month that's amazing and that
little trio is $36 which makes sense
considering each sponge is 12 bucks
amazing I'm so awesome that we got
three the next thing is the boxes the
scattering so this is a highlighter by
Oprah cosmetics and I was really excited
when I saw this because this is in the
shade Rodale dress Rodeo Drive which is
like their light golden color and I was
really excited to receive this because
actually gave mine away to a friend
because she loved it so much I was I got
keep it and then I came back to me in a
box asurim
see everything you put out in the world
eventually comes back so always do good
I'm really excited I love these Oprah
highlights but they are extremely
extremely intense you guys know a lot of
the times I go for a very natural subtle
highlight unless I'm going out at night
where I want to be blingy this is a
blingy highlight like this Oh mate your
cheekbones pop big-time this is a
full-sized product of course and this
retails for $35 I want to show you what
it looks like on the cheek when I'm
really really fair this is a little bit
too dark for me
test test
the first layer you put on your face is
enough a little goes such a long way
like look at that as glowy that is so
pretty for a night out this will make
your cheeks pop in flash photography
like on another level a little bit on my
nose on the bridge and leaned on the
cupid bow I think I'm going to be
wearing this more often in the summer
time I really love how that looks okay
so the next thing in the Box is this big
book thing this is the concealer
collection 16 color throw concealer
palette from the brand measurable
different I've never heard of this brand
before this is a full size product and a
retail for $19.99 it says it features 16
versatile shades that works for any skin
tone and it's just like a bunch of
concealers so let me open this with this
guy these are the colors let me swatch
these just to feel the texture
well they don't feel terrible but I feel
like maybe on my dry skin this might be
a little drying on me it even has a
bunch of shades where you can cream
contour if you want it does say if you
want to cream your consistency add your
favorite Beauty oil and then apply I
remember when the cream contour kit came
out by anastacio that one was pretty dry
and I think I saw a lot of people like
dipping oil into that I already have
under-eye concealer on because
personally this is not the kind of
concealer that I would wear underneath
my eyes anyway but I already knew based
on the outside that this was probably
going to be the kind of concealer I
wanted for blemishes and not for
underneath the eyes so I went ahead and
did my under eye makeup and all that but
let's just give it a go on a blemish
I've been really keeping up with my
skincare lately I think I'm going to
take the shade cappuccino right here on
my finger and pop that right on top I'm
sorry I can't really put this to the
test because it's not something I would
use under my eyes anyway and I'm not
having any bad breakouts right now to
let you know but you know I'm always a
hundred percent honest on my channel no
matter what and in my personal opinions
by swatching these and feeling them I
feel like these might be a little bit
too drying for my skin maybe if you have
oily skin this might work for you they
just feel a little too thick for me so I
would say this is not my favorite thing
in the book okay two more things in the
Box this guy this is the hair hurt
smoothing yogurt shampoo and I believe
the brand is Project Beauty I know we've
got him this brand in a box before not
that long ago either but I think I gave
that product to my mom but this is
something I'm definitely interested in
because it's shampoo and I actually just
run out of my Brio Gio shampoo so I
might give this a shot I'm trying to
look here to see if it has any silicone
because I'm not trying to use silicone
on my hair but it doesn't say did Mexico
nor anything like that in the ingredient
list which is nice it says we keep the
ugly stuff out so it's free of sulfates
parabens harsh salt systems harmful
colors and harmful fragrances and it's
supposed to help tame unruly frizzy and
dry hair oh my gosh that literally just
described me perfectly it has probiotics
quinoa and super bowl tentacles for
beautiful
here the scent is strawberry-banana
I'm actually going to open it to see if
it smells like strawberry banana excuse
my nails by the way I don't know if you
could tell on camera but I was opening
some boxes and one of the boxes was like
so dirty I have never seen a dirtier box
in my life and it stained the tip of my
nails like it stained my nails black at
the tip yeah oh yes but already been
ahah wow that actually smells really
good that smells kind of like my
childhood this smells like those
shampoos those temples um I used to use
as a kid which probably weren't the best
for your hair anyway they looked like
little fish
what are those channels called you guys
know what I'm talking about I'm sure a
bunch of you are like screaming it right
now they came in different colors and
they had like an eyeball on it it was
like shaped like a fish that's what this
smells like it reminds me of that which
is nice
ah childhood how I wish I could make it
again I'm telling you I hit 25 and it's
like a reality truck hit me when I hit
25 or so 24 hours this is cool lorry 24
I was good and I felt young I felt alive
then 25 had me and I was like am I gonna
have to be like a super adult now 25 is
really young obviously of course but
it's not as young as 10 or 11 or 12
sometimes it still hits me like what I'm
talking about what you know what now I
have to Google that fish shampoo Oh
Laurie oh wow so we can move on now okay
so the last thing in the Box is this guy
right here this is from the brand car go
cosmetics and it is in this love I was
thinking it was going to be a liquid
lipstick but I'm kind of pleasantly
surprised as a lip gloss it's full size
a coat of coast and it retails for $16
and this is in the shade towel couch
couch I get alright so let's see this I
love this color by the way my lips are
extremely extremely extremely dry after
my stomach virus it feel like it's been
difficult to get my lips back to normal
I've been using aqua for like crazy but
my lips are so chapped
so this lip gloss is really pretty it's
just very sheer
I expected it to be a little bit more
pigmented this would probably look
really nice on top of a nude lipstick
when you don't really want to alter the
color that much but you do want to give
it some shine okay guys so that
completes this video these are all the
products I got in this month's box to
share I did the math and the overall
value of this month's box was 116
dollars which is amazing I will leave
