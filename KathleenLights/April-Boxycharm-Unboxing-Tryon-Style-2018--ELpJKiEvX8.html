wanna try I think you don't even care
what you look like that is how I am
feeling today hey guys so today's video
is going to be mad
Betsey Schumann back and I listen I feel
like this has been a constant thing I'm
always telling you guys about my
situation situations but last night I
woke up like four times in the middle
night with horrible stomach aches and
you know what it is my fault it is my
fault because I had spaghetti last night
and I know I know I came to the
conclusion not that long ago that
spaghetti sauce messes up my stomach but
I love spaghetti and I was like well I'm
just gonna add a little bit of sauce
it's not gonna do anything but know it
was a really rough night for me I barely
slipped my stomach felt like there were
bombs going off like you just heard it
was it was pretty intense but I'm
feeling much better this morning and I
thought okay I need a film a laid back
casual video because I'm not feeling the
best as usual and I thought about to
share my box
please ignore my appearance all I did
was pick my hair up in a bun and put on
earrings cuz I even went to sleep in
this shirt so good morning alright so I
don't know if you guys are new here to
my unboxing videos but I like to take a
little peek myself before I sit down to
film these videos just so I know what to
put on my face what not to put on and
today there is a skincare product in the
box which is why I have no foundation on
no makeup on except my brows because I
have to have those on always but this is
what the box looks like this month and
I'm not gonna lie I'm so excited for
this month's box so many good stuff here
but you get a little nervous oh it's
like a little boxy charm like oh and
flick type of thing is this the cart wow
look at it it's usually like a card but
this is like a like a full-blown story
here you get the prices and everything
right here so I'm gonna hold on to that
you also get a coupon code by the way
but I'm gonna help you out here if you
use the code April Boxey you get 10% off
on tart Kampf alright so the first thing
we're gonna try out is this guy and I
had never seen this before I had never
heard of it but when I was reading it
this morning I was like boom this looks
real interesting this is the dr. Brandt
pores no more vacuum cleaner this is a
pore purifying
we've got in dr. Branton the box before
I think we got the pores no more
exfoliator and we've also got in the
pores no more Luminizer primer which I
really like so I'm very excited to try
this
I like their pores no more line I'm
hoping I like this it says it's for oily
and combination skin so I don't know if
it's for me but we're gonna try it out
anyway it says after cleansing apply a
thin layer to areas of concern okay so
I'm not gonna plan this on my entire
face I'm just gonna apply it in areas
like right here right here maybe like on
my forehead here a little bit on machine
right I guess
avoid eyes leave on for 5 to 10 minutes
until dry a cooling sensation will occur
rinse with warm water and pat dry it
says to use 2 to 3 times a week for
maximum results but it's supposed to
unclog and tighten the look of pores and
reduce excess oil from the skin surface
my surface ain't got no oil what all
right so my face is already cleaned I
watched it before I picked up my hair at
about my hair is so puffy right now that
I literally like at this my mama's gonna
be like how can you look so crazy in
that video when there's thousands of
people watching you and I'm like I am
Who I am okay so I am a bit concerned
since my skin is so dry I'm just gonna
apply this in these areas oh my gosh
wait this has like little blue beads
this squeezes out clear but then there's
little blue beads inside this product
and then they kind of pop as you apply
it to your skin can you see right there
okay so I'm assuming you just like mix
it all together until it's like a blue
color
okay so because I have a pretty dry
forehead right here I really don't want
to focus that there so that's all I'm
gonna do and I'm gonna leave this on for
five to ten minutes and I already feel a
cooling sensation like this does feel
really cold on the skin especially when
you do dates but I'm just gonna let it
dry and then I'll rinse it off and let
you know if I see a difference or not
okay it's been ten minutes
I'm about to rinse this off but I
actually want to zoom you in and show
you my nose I don't know if you can tell
it kind of has like little spots
everywhere and I think that's the mask
targeting my pores maybe I'm wrong no
that's how I feel
it does feel super dry on my skin like
my skin does feel really tight so I'm
curious to see how my skin feels once I
rinse this off but I'm gonna go do that
now and I will let you know okay I'm
back so right off the bat I just want to
say I definitely feel this cooling
sensation now I don't know if that is
what it's that's what's supposed to
happen but my face feels almost like
cold and I kind of like it it does feel
a little bit tight here on my cheeks but
that is obviously because I have such
dry skin and this is targeted more for
oily skin but I also think in my pores
look a little bit smoother and a little
bit cleaner like they've been cleaned
out a bit I'm not 100% sure cuz I didn't
really look at my pores before putting
on the mask I definitely should have
done that but my skin overall looks
brighter in that area like a little D
clogged but maybe that's just my mind so
far so good I'm gonna continue to use
this but I'm only gonna use this in
those areas where I applied it because
my skin does feel a little tight and I
don't want to over dry my skin when it
comes to face masks I have to use them
more than once to see how I really feel
about it but so far so good
also this is a full-sized product and
this retails for four to seven dollars
that's amazing okay so really quickly
I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
foundation concealer powder bronzer all
that good stuff and then I will be back
to finish some book singing oh right
anyway the next thing in the box is this
guy so this is from a brand called the
brow gal and this is the instant tinted
eyebrow gel it says tinted eyebrow gel
with microfibers to achieve a natural
hair look perfect for the customer who
wants a quick but natural
to their brows um yes please I love brow
gels that have little fibers in them I
used to really love that Milani 100k
what wait Bush eight is this this one is
for light hair 0-3 that's the problem I
feel with these kinds of products like
how does boxycharm know if the products
are sending out like fits their
customers because a bunch of people get
the same box
I mean box is very but a bunch of people
get the same box I mean I don't know I
feel like this might be too late for my
brows actually but we're gonna try it
out anyway so maybe you should assume
you went out a little more okay so I
already have brow gel in my brows
because I did my brows first and then I
realized after that I had this in the
box but pretended no hado
yeah I definitely think that this is too
light for my brows this would have been
perfect for me
a few months ago when my hair was like
that light
auburn kind of color but I definitely
see those little fibers sticking to my
brows I just do not like that color but
I do feel like I would really like this
formula though like the little fibers
that are sticking to it like feel like
it's making my brows look fuller so I'm
actually gonna look into this brand and
maybe try out a deeper shade because I
do not like this color I mean the color
doesn't look bad like it looks perfectly
fine with my hair actually now that I've
zoomed out I feel like I would like a
shade a little bit deeper than this but
I feel like I would like this formula so
so far so good with this one I'm gonna
look into that brand actually so now the
most exciting thing in this entire box
look at this how exciting is this color
pop is now in a boxy charm box like I
mean color pop has been in boxycharm box
before with liquid lipsticks but they
have in my shop am I the only one that's
super stoked about this I'm pretty sure
that you get like five different
palettes in the box you like five
different options but my box has the
element of surprise and it's actually
funny that this is the one in my box
because this is probably the one I use
the least actually I think I gave mine
to my president I don't even think I
have my element of surprise anymore
listen it's a thing whenever somebody
comes into my PA room and they pick
something up and they're like oh my gosh
I'd love this I just give it to them
it's become a habit at this point like
anytime somebody likes something I just
I have so much that I don't mind people
taking stuff and I'm pretty sure my
cousine really like these and I gave
it's her but look at this look how it
works it's back in my hands I feel like
that happens a lot in life always give
it's always good to give because you
never know this is the element of
surprise palette and I think for me what
really didn't draw me to this palette
was the packaging out of all of
colourpop's eyeshadow palettes this is
the packaging that's my least favorite I
don't know it's just something about the
pattern that never like called my
attention but the eyeshadows inside this
palette are actually really really great
the color combination is really cool
this is one of their most unique
palettes I'm going to do a little look
with this I actually want to use this
color all over my lid because
immediately I'm just drawn to that shade
and I've never used it before so I'm
gonna do that okay so you know a drill I
don't like these videos to be too long
so I'm just gonna point and apply and
speed through this part
really quickly I just want to say this
color is so deceiving because you can
see like in the light
it looks like silvery purpley but then
it's peach which I'm not hating it I
actually really freaking love the color
but it just looks peach on the I know
I'm kind of surprised because I mean I
had never used that eyeshadow before
like in the light it kind of looks
different I don't know this is a super
cool wife Oh a little bit surprised that
the color but I think it's nice let's
continue
okay so that is pretty much it I'm now
realizing that I did a very similar look
in like a recent boxycharm video like
I'm with that pure palate maybe I should
have done something more chocolatey and
smokey but I feel like I do that all the
time I really like how this look turned
out it's very pink and warm and I love
colors like that and I love color pop
eyeshadows and these are sixteen dollars
so it's really amazing that we are
getting this in the box let's go ahead
and see what else is inside this box
okay so the next thing is this and I'm
really excited that there's a Tarte
product in the box because I always get
really excited when it's high-end or
when it's a brand that I'm really
familiar with but I don't think I like
these this is the TARDIS Pro Glo liquid
highlighter and this in the shade stoner
actually don't have this shade but I
remember trying out like a golden color
and I did not like it this is a liquid
highlighter you're supposed to just
apply it on top of your face
I actually don't well I actually do I
was gonna say I don't have any powders
on my face but bronzer is technically
powder and I did set my under eye
concealer but even though I don't like
these I am gonna apply it on camera for
you guys just so you can see maybe I end
up liking this color I don't know to me
it's mainly the formula the one I tried
just looked a little bit too glittery on
my skin like it looked chunky and very
very unnatural but we shall see this is
like the Beauty Blender blusher it's
just their tiny little bit of liner I'm
gonna go wet this cuz I'm gonna so I'm
gonna take a little bit of this stunner
color on the back of my hand these are
very thick and moosie which is why I
think don't really work for me
personally I like something a little bit
more liquidy but the color is so so
gorgeous I'm gonna try using it with a
sponge on one side and then a brush on
the other side which me look Oh
I'm like breaking out right here have so
many bumps I already have highlight on
which I didn't realize when I was
applying my foundation I was like oh I
don't have a highlighter to test out let
me put on highlight but I absolutely did
have a highlight
so actually that looks really nice I do
have a lot of texture right now so I
feel like it's emphasizing all my little
pimples but I feel like I might like it
if those little suckers weren't there
the only thing is this content to look
very glittery like if you saw my skin in
person there are little shimmers
throughout this product which a lot of
people don't mind some people really
like that intense blinding shimmery
highlight but that's just not me this
might even be cool mixed in with your
foundation but I will say it looks
pretty cool and I do like it more than
that golden color right right but I'm
gonna try applying it with my finger on
the other side yeah I prefer a smudge so
this is a very blinding highlight it is
really really intense but like I said
it's definitely not for me I don't like
this texture but it might be a really
cool I shadow though as I say it's just
for the face no it just says liquid
highlighter I'm gonna apply a little bit
to the center of my lid and I might
regret that tremendously but I might not
you never know until you try right the
thing is that these dries so fast so I
feel like by the time you start applying
it they just dry which is probably a
good thing for eyeshadow though I might
have applied a little bit too much right
there in the crease so it kind of looks
a little funky but I actually think it
looks cool on the lids the only thing is
that it's just hard to blend it dries no
no oh my god okay wait I'm getting I'm
getting a better blend and you know what
I like it I do like the little effect
that that added to my eyes the only
thing like I said it is very hard to
blend it does dry really quickly and
then when you try to blend it out it
does look a little bit splotchy so you
have to work really fast not my favorite
product in the box personally if there's
a full-size products and this retails
for $29 I don't I don't think it's worth
twenty dollars okay so the last product
is a liquid lipstick and I actually
don't know what color this is so I don't
even know if this matches my eye makeup
I mean there's a little picture right
here and I don't know if that's the
color we have this is from a brand
called a DS ad s ad s wow I'm sorry but
it's the high definition liquid lipstick
it's a full-size product and it retails
for $24 so let's see
oh boy fit so pretty oh I like that
mmm wow this smells amazing you know
what this smells like the NYX soft matte
those soft matte lip creams the smells
kind of like it but more chocolaty
almost I feel like if I had my own
liquid lipstick they would smell like
this
I don't know if this dries down matte
because it looks pretty creamy and
glossy in the packaging creamy
long-wearing liquid lipstick provides
the dazzling full coverage of a lipstick
with the ease of one applicator made
with advanced polymers and intense
pigments for long-lasting brilliant
color and intense shine in a single
sweep okay so this isn't a matte liquid
lipstick it's just a liquefied lipstick
so let's try it on ooh that's a pretty
color
definitely should have used a lip liner
underneath this but wow this feels so
tacky but not in a bad way and like a
super full coverage pigmented kind of
way I feel like if I applied a lip liner
underneath my entire lips and then put
this on top based on the texture I feel
like this would last forever it feels
like a long wearing lip color do you
know what I mean do you ever have those
moments like when you know oh this is
gonna stay on all day and this color is
gorgeous I totally see this color
working for so many different skin tones
okay guys so that completes this video
after doing some calculations the
overall value of the box is over 135
dollars which is insane because you paid
21 I really liked this lip this was
pretty good I'm still gonna test it out
with this pretty good this amazing I
didn't like the color of this but the
formula seems good and the only thing I
didn't like is the Tarte product but I
love the brands that they included and
the box just was really good this month
so yeah I would love to know what you
got in your box this month did you get
the same palette as me what did you get
I would love to know did the tint a
fiber brow thing work for you like did
you get a color that was good for you
leave it in the comments below
but that completes this video guys thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye okay
since I am a brick
I am whatever you say I am if why would
I say yeah something like that you know
what this smells like the NYX soft matte
