you my April favorites and these are
just things that I've loved throughout
the month of April um I don't have a lot
of stuff because I feel like the things
that I've really really been loving
recently I've been loving them for like
a week and that would be cheating so
these are the things I've been loving
the majority of April okay so first I
want to share with you the petites dry
shampoo this is the one that's in fruity
and cheeky cherry I don't know if this
is new it says new on the bottle so I'm
gonna roll with it but oh my god this is
so good um after a bad experience with
the Dove dry shampoo I really thought
the authorized shampoos sucked and I was
just I was just not a fan of dry shampoo
until I found this bad boy and it was
only seven dollars and for some reason I
thought that batiste was a lot more
expensive because it was so good and
everybody loved it so I thought I was
like an expensive for some reason I
thought it was this is awesome because
you can get away with not washing your
hair for an extra day cuz this just
sucks up all the oils and it really does
just like make your hair look a lot less
greasy I love this this next little
product came in my Ipsy bag and I've
been using it non-stop ever since and
it's the healthy sexy hair soy renewal
nourishing styling treatment and this is
right up my alley because it's supposed
to tame frizz and it really does so I
wear this on days where I curl my hair
like on things like today where I just
don't care it's like you know my big
puffy curly hair so this really does
tame my friends I love using this I also
use this on days where I just curl my
hair with a curling iron or with my flat
iron when I do my curls because for some
reason my hair still gets frizzy even if
it's with an iron if I'm curling it
pretty weird but this just works like a
charm and I still have a lot left and
I've used it every time I wash my hair
so this this is a pretty good size the
next thing should be no surprise if you
watch my videos
and it is my jumbo lip pencil obsession
that I've had recently I am obsessed
with these things her firmly the
covergirl ones and the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains I like these
because they're a stain and I like these
because they're really moisturizing and
they're shiny and glossy these lasts
longer but they're a little bit sticky a
little bit like barely noticeable sticky
and these are not sticky at all so
that's why I like these two brands um I
really want to try the hard candy ones I
don't know if any other brands have
jumbo lip pencils that are really good
please let me know down below because I
love these things but the two that I've
really really been done recently are the
Revlon one in charm charming yeah
chart and the covergirl one in ballet
twists this is charm right here this is
the Revlon kissable balm stain and this
is ballet twist which is like a light
shiny pink with like subtle gold to it
which is really really really subtle so
you can't really see it but it is
gorgeous this next thing I feel like I
have to mention because it is a Mac a
dupe and it is an amazing Mac dude and
it is the NYX soft lip cream in addis
ababa these aren't new or anything I
know they've been out for a while but
this smells heavenly
like not even having these it smells
better than heaven oh my god it smells
better than MAC lipsticks and that's a
lot to say because I feel like MAC
lipsticks
MAC lipsticks smell fantastic but this
smells like candy like buttery like
caramel e come in candy candy
anyway so this is a dupe for Mac's girl
about town like an exact dupe and girl
about town is one of my favorite MAC
lipsticks I will swatch them
side-by-side so you can see this is girl
about town and this
as half of a-- for some reason on camera
this looks like a more neon e pink but i
promise you on the lips you can't tell
the difference I've worn them both at
the same time like and you just can't
tell it's crazy how similar these are I
don't know why I'm camera it's not
picking that up but they're very very
similar the only difference is of course
the formula and stuff this is a little
bit more sheer but you can build it up
really well and this is an amplified
cream so it's like creamier and glossy
err and this is like a matte lip cream
which it's not mad at all in my opinion
but anyway I just wanted to mention this
because I love that I found this it's
just an amazing dupe and it's an amazing
lipstick or lip gloss or whatever you
want to call this and it smells great
and I know it I feel like it's so dark
like when I decided to film a giant fat
cloud a gray cloud just decided to roll
along in front of my window thanks big
guy okay I want to talk about a shadow
palette really quickly so the first one
I want to talk about is the Naked basics
palette and I have been using this
non-stop like crazy I've used it in my
get ready with me video with the really
really dramatic black smokey eye and I
all I used was these two colors you can
get a really really dramatic look with
you know these colors here and a really
soft everyday look with these so
versatile and it's so little and compact
and travel friendly and amazing and I
love this I might I was gonna say that I
might like it more than my original
Naked palette no no no it's closed
I'd like it definitely more than I get
to personally the next pair of palettes
I want to share with you are the wet and
wild color icon palettes these are the
ones that come in the six pan um they
don't sell these anymore but I got em on
Amazon for $3 each which is amazing
I would pay $10 each for these because
the quality of these eyeshadows are so
good and so comparable so like Mac or
Urban Decay these are the best eyes
shadows in
drug store and they're probably the
cheapest crazy I know so this is vanity
and this one is lust this is just filled
with beautiful purples and this is
amazing for everyday I want to pick up
greed and pride those are the only two
that I'm missing because I love these so
much this palette is actually what I'm
wearing on my eyes right now on these
women so you can so as you can see it's
just like a bronzy Goldie smokey eye
you can do so many different looks with
these palettes it's incredible how good
they are I cannot say enough things
about these and it really sucks that
they don't sell these in the store
anymore because personally I like these
more than the trio's and the 8 pan we
don't want to that shows even though
those are amazing too but you get me my
favorite body mist of all time right now
is the dark kiss from mm-hmm Catherine
body where ya from I always get the best
or confused with Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond for
some weird reason but yeah it's the dark
kiss from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and I know
you're wondering why do you have to
almost empty bottles good question um I
keep this one in my purse that's why
this one's all beat up
and I keep this one in my bathroom if I
could keep on in the closet in one in
the kitchen and one everywhere I would
these are so incredibly amazing and
they're only $14 I prefer these over the
Victoria's Secret ones I do love the
Victoria's Secret ones I really do but I
prefer these over them not only they
cheaper but they last a lot longer on
your body in my opinion the crazy thing
about this perfume is that it lasts
longer than some of the perfumes that I
own that are actual perfumes and not
body mists I know that sounds super
untrue but it's very much true I will
spritz this on all over my body in the
morning and it might time I still smell
it like it stays on my skin it's so
crazy this lasts so long the smell the
scent just lasts all day it's amazing
and it smells like ok here we go it's
definitely a sweet smell if you're not
into sweets then you probably won't like
this but you smell like I suck at this
you just smell like like candy I just
fresh amazing candy fresh candy yeah
that's how I'm gonna describe this I was
at the mall my friend once and she was
like oh my god are you wearing
Flowerbomb and I was like no wearing
dark kiss so I don't know how much this
smells like flower
he was probably delusional cuz I don't
think this smells like flower bomb but
flower bomb does smell amazing so maybe
I don't her nose was probably way off so
don't just ignore whatever I just said
ignore that and I had worn it earlier
that day and we went to the mall occur
on five and still the aroma was
everywhere this is my absolute favorite
body mist forever from now on I will not
purchase anything else because you are a
godsend and last but not least I have a
people favorite for the month and it is
my friend Shireen here on YouTube she I
didn't know who she was and she
mentioned me in a video she gave me like
a little shout-out without me asking her
to I mean I don't ask anybody to do that
but I didn't ask her to and she gave me
a cute little shoutout and it was so
sweet and we talk all the time now and
she's my youtube friend and I just
wanted to give her a little shout out
myself because she's so sweet she looks
like Princess Jasmine I am going to have
her little link down below she's awesome
and yeah that's my people favorite for
the month person favorite for the month
so that is everything I've been loving
most of the month of April it wasn't
much I have a lot more in my may
favorites because I've been
a lot of things recently and I feel like
I'm gonna love them all month as well so
