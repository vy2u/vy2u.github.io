my April favorites video I love filming
monthly favorites videos because it
means it is one one closer to Danny so
every time like ah I have to film a
favorites video that means another month
has passed okay so I'm gonna start off
by talking about my favorite mascara
combination recently and it is the
l'oreal voluminous carbon black paired
off with the maybelline rocket volume
express I love this combination I like
my mascaras to lengthen a little bit but
when I look for a mascara I look more
for a volumizing mascara and this one on
its own is not my favorite it gets a
little bit clumpy and a little bit too
thick too fast so what I like to do is
add a thin coat of this to my top lashes
and then I follow up with the Maybelline
Rockette volume Express these are both
volumizing mascaras but I feel like the
rocket mascara the brush does a really
good job of separating my lashes I don't
know what it is but these two combined
it just made some really really thick
but separated at the same time it's the
mascara I'm wearing right now and I get
a lot of compliments on my lashes when I
use this combo I do not use this on my
bottom lashes because this stuff smears
everywhere if you put it on the bottom
lashes at least for me it does
like I get runny black crap all over the
bottom of my eye and I never get that
with any mascara just this one but on
the top of my lashes it doesn't smear it
off so I use this one on my bottom
lashes and I just wanted to mention this
combo because it's what I've been using
and I love it and through drugstores so
it's affordable it's great my next
favorite is an eyeshadow from Mac and it
is called soft brown I have been using
this eyeshadow non-stop since the day I
got it and honestly I do not know what I
was using in my crease before this
because I picked it up recently and I
was like where have you been on my
it is the perfect transition shade that
perfect crease to shade and it is a warm
brown which is what I prefer for my
crease but seriously it just gives the
most beautiful little warmth to your
eyes and it is when I'm wearing on my
eyelids today this is the only thing on
my eyelids like dust it on top very very
lightly like without even a primer or
anything and I just absolutely love this
color it's a must-have for me my next
favorite is also from Mac and it is
something that I have been so obsessed
with it is Mac's
emphasised powder this is a pearl
sculpting powder and pretty sure that's
what it's called you'd only get these at
a pro store I got mine online since the
closest probe store to me is like pretty
far so I got mine online you don't have
to be like a pro member or anything to
buy Pro products but this is what I have
been using to set my under eye concealer
and it just illuminates your face like
in a crazy beautiful way it just gives
you like that bright under eye look that
I think is so beautiful if you like that
really really highlighted under eye and
then definitely pick up emphasize from
Mac because this will be your new best
friend I recommend using a very very
very light hand with this because when I
first got it I was like because I
thought it was just like a regular
powder no no you need to use a very
light hand with this a little goes a
super long way so just dust it
underneath your eyes and it's just like
a beautiful glowing perfection and it
sets your concealer and it's just
absolutely amazing I love this so so
much so I have been completely in love
with these Sephora sold video bronzer
since the day that I got this I know I
haven't been using it like the entire
month of April but I have been using it
every single day since I got it it has
become probably my favorite bronzer ever
and that seems crazy it's up there with
my benefits hoola bronzer which is my
favorite matte bronzer of all time it is
up there it is so gorgeous so beautiful
I have a full review on this product I
will link it down below if you're
interested in seeing my thoughts and the
application and all that good stuff but
it has amazing ingredients in it this
just gives me the most
natural looking contour ever this is the
only bronzer I am wearing on my face
right now it is super super buildable
it just looks flawless and you can't go
wrong with it because this whole easy to
blend you really cannot go wrong with
this and you get so much product to get
point 88 ounces so for $22 that's pretty
good because it's like double the amount
of any other bronzer at half it's gonna
last forever it is limited edition
definitely go get your hands on this if
you are interested oh I love this so so
so so much so I have been really really
into glowy skin well I mean I've always
been into glowy skin because if I can
have that dinner for lopes radiance all
the time I would but recently I have
just been obsessed with getting that
glow factor to my face I'm usually
really into matte blushes and just
adding a highlight on the top but these
days I just want everything very
shimmery and very beautiful so I have
three products to talk about that give
me that glow factor to my face two of
them are highlighters slash blushes I
would say this is the Maybelline master
highlight highlighting blush in the
shade nude this is definitely considered
more of a highlight than a blush I like
to put any type of blush on and just
throw this on top of it to give my blush
an extra dewy glowy effect but honestly
most of the time I just use it on its
own on my cheeks and it gives me such a
beautiful glowy pinky bronzy look but if
you are any shade darker than me then I
this would definitely be your highlight
and I just absolutely I just love this
and love this for my cheeks so another
product that's pretty similar but I
actually love just a little bit more it
is feet bombs
Cindy Luminizer the balm has the mary
lou manizer that's super popular it's
like that white gold highlight shade and
they have the betty loumanizer which is
like a gold and then I have this one
which is their more recent one and is a
little bit more pinky and I did not
think I was gonna like this at all
because I'm not into pinky little
highlights I'm more into like the whites
and the golds and Ken
it's kind of highlights but this really
really surprised me this is so gorgeous
that honestly it has become one of my
favorite products of all time now like I
cannot live without this product I mean
I can't its makeup but I really really
love it the second I hit pan I'm gonna
go purchase this and it's it's insane
how pretty this is I use this as a blush
alone I don't know how to highlight on
top of it because it gives you that glow
factor but I use it as a blush because
for my skin tone it is pigmented enough
to where it just looks like a light
blush on my cheeks I have been using
this in so many of my recent videos and
I cannot describe how amazing it is the
texture is very very creamy and the
color is just really really unique to me
there's pink to it but there's a lot of
peachy undertones to it as well and it
like glows definitely go check up a
student illuminator because it is beyond
amazing and the last product I want to
talk about when it comes to like
beautiful glowy skin is this product by
Mac it is their cream color base and I
got mine in the shade pearl this stuff
is no joke intense beautiful high
pigment highlights it is what I'm
wearing on my cheeks today that's super
super intense highlight that I have
going on it's this yeah yeah I went
overboard maybe - glowy for some people
but I like it I want to look like a
mermaid at all times I was super super
impressed with this product I have been
looking for that perfect cream highlight
it is very very glowy but it isn't
sticky which is my issue with cream
colored things on my face I don't like
the stickiness this is not sticky and of
course you don't have to get all
dramatic like me and put a lot of it a
little goes a long way and you could
just dab it on your cheeks very lightly
and still get a beautiful glow to your
cheeks my favorite way to apply this is
with my Real Techniques sponge or my
Beauty Blender I just dampen my sponge
and then I pop it in this sucker like
this that did that and then I will just
apply it to my cheeks like that
something about the sponge just gives it
a more dewy appearance I don't
I just this combination is beautiful or
any damp sponge it doesn't really matter
but I have just been loving this on my
cheeks oh so nice okay so I have been
using my NYX butter glosses like crazy
recently I have these three colors I'm
actually going to Ulta tomorrow
and buying a bunch more but I have been
using these non-stop I have meringue
Eclair and creme brulee these three are
absolutely gorgeous creme brulee is
probably my favorite one it is the
perfect nude gloss like where any pink
any nude lipstick this is the perfect
topper of that but I have been super
obsessed with meringue recently it's a
really pretty cool tone pink that has a
lot of purple to it I just I love those
type of colors it is beautiful these are
the glasses that conformed me into a lip
gloss wear because you could ask anybody
I hated lip gloss but these are super
buttery super creamy super smooth I
don't think they're sticky
they just feel so comfortable on the
lips and these are the only glosses I
own then make your lips look juicy I
don't know how to explain it but the
shine to it is so beautiful that it just
looks like your lips are nice and
luscious
I love these definitely check out the
NYX butter glosses even if you are not a
lipgloss where they're super affordable
and they sell them at Ulta Target and
recently I saw them at my CVS so danger
dangerous okay so I'm going to quickly
talk about two haircare products that
I've really been loving recently you
guys have seen that I've been wearing my
hair a little bit more natural these
days I haven't been ironing it or
straightening it all that much at all
I'm just trying to give my hair a break
from heat especially in the spring and
summer I don't feel the need to really
iron it that much and I've suffered from
really really really fluffy hair in my
life I had a really really kinky hair
growing up but so much ironing it I've
been ironing it for like the past nine
or ten years since middle school
because I hated my curly hair so much it
was
just an issue I had I did not like it so
from so many years of ironing it it
doesn't get those really really kinky
tight curls that I used to have but it
still gets puffy still gets puffy so I
recently discovered a mousse that I have
really been loving and it is the l'oreal
new boost it volume inject mousse it
says 24-hour body and volume extra
stronghold with a soft touch those are
the words that stuck out to me at Target
when I was shopping I was like extra
stronghold and a soft touch it sounds
too good to be true so I bought it I
gave it a shot and it's actually true
this does a great job of leaving my hair
nice and curly but it does not leave my
hair crunchy at all I hate crunchy
mousses there's nothing worse than
having your hair look like it's stiff
and wet still because the mousse is just
so crunchy this doesn't do that it gives
me nice body nice volume and a nice soft
touch it's true when you first apply it
to your hair it does feel just a little
bit hard but as the day goes on it's
really really soft and it doesn't frizz
up I don't know I really have been
enjoying this moves definitely gonna
repurchase it when I run out of it
because it's become an absolute favorite
and then the second haircare product I
want to talk about it's what's really
been helping my frizz and it is the
kenra platinum Socony gloss this is
fantastic
it says lightweight formula for a silky
lustrous hair and skin I don't know
about the skin thing but I promise you
that after I apply this to my hair my
hands feel great so I mean it does make
my hands feel really really nice but I
don't necessarily apply this to my skin
but it says smooth over damp or dry hair
and skin and apply heat for optimum
shine and condition I use this when my
hair is just a little bit damp and then
I apply some more once it's completely
dry and I apply it over that mousse I
just showed you because it tames a
little bit of the frizz ease right after
I use the mousse this stuff makes my
hair look so shiny and silky even when I
have straight hair I like to apply it to
my tips because it gives such a
beautiful shine to my hair and the best
part is oh this smells so delicious
it smells like candy I don't know what
this smells like but is oh my god
the best scent ever literally the best
scent ever and it makes my hair smell
like that for a pretty long time which
is great okay so my last favorite is a
scent from Bath and Body Works that I
have been crazy about and if you follow
me on Instagram you already know what
I'm gonna say it is the Oahu coconut
sunset buying fragrance mist this stuff
is like I can't even describe it
this is the perfect spring and summer
scent it smells like a coconut paradise
it's not full-blown coconuts there is
other amazing sets happening in this
bottle actually have the notes pulled up
on my phone right now so I can kind of
describe to you what this smells like
but honestly I can't even pronounce half
of these notes but it says top notes
which are the notes that you smell the
most it is birds of paradise
coconut blossom bergamot mid notes his
two boroughs two boroughs pink tiger
lily Peter Pan Hawaiian monoi and the
dry notes are labdanum molten amber and
cream suede I don't know that probably
didn't help you at all but I just wanted
to describe it because it's not just
flat-out coconut there's a lot of
sexiness going on in the spot or if
that's what it is sexy I can't
compliment it every time I wear this
like I'll get in someone's car and
they're like whoa you smell phenomenal
and I'm like I know Oh welcome coconut
sunset
I love it so much that I bought three of
these and I keep this one in the room
this one in bathroom this one in my
Paris I'm gonna have one in my glove
compartment in my car that is how much
I'm obsessed with this scent amazing out
of this world and I know it's just
limited edition around for this time I'm
gonna go stock up it's just I want it
forever
what forever and by the way thank you to
all you guys who said that they do sell
the dark kiss fragrance on the Bath and
Body Works website because they don't
sell it in stores anymore I don't know
why they're out of their mind that's
their best fragrance ever but I saw that
it is online so I'm going to be ordering
some online because it is my favorite
ever so thank you for having my back you
