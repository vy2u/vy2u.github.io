my April favorites I'm gonna be talking
about all the products I really really
was loving in the month of April and
before I get on to other pot I poked
myself before I start talking about all
these products I just want to let you
guys know that this video is a collab
with Essie button which I'm sure you
guys know who that is we decided it
would be a good idea to kind of film our
favorites videos together even though
we're not together but we thought we
would give each other a mention in this
video she is definitely a monthly
favorite
she's a yearly favorite I have been
watching Essie button for a very long
time she's one of the first youtubers I
ever saw like back when she was like in
her dorm room I'm an OG subscriber of SE
OG right here I'm gonna link her
favorites video down below and I'm also
gonna link her channel down below I know
you guys are gonna love her I know you
already know who I'm talking about
but if you don't go subscribe to her
because she's amazing she has a great
sense of humor and I'm always like super
intrigued watching her videos like her
videos don't bore me at all so I will
leave SES or esday miss her name I will
leave her down below go subscribe you
won't regret it so my first favorite is
kind of a weird one and if you watch a
lot of YouTube videos like I do you
might have heard about this moisturizer
that's been going around called be nygma
a lot of people have been raving about
it but it is really really pricey and
two of the major ingredients in that
moisturizer I'm sure it has a bunch of
other benefits as well like a bunch of
other goodness I'm sure it's amazing
that two major ingredients in that
moisturizer or night cream is manuka
honey and bee venom and they're both
really really good for your skin so on I
herb calm I shop a lot on iherb.com
I found this bad boy right here
this is 100% raw manuka honey and bee
venom which is two of the major
ingredients in that little moisturizer
so I decided to pick this up and I love
this this is what I use as a face mask I
will just I mean I don't want to open it
because it's literally honey like it's
honey you
can't eat this don't get scared like Oh
bee venom I don't wanna eat that it's
not like poison a lot of people that
were reviewing the product on a herb
calm said it actually tasted really good
i slather this all over my face like
there's no rhyme or reason to this I
literally scoop it out and with a like a
little spatula and put it all over my
face and I'll leave it on for about
thirty minutes I mean you could leave it
on for like five minutes you could leave
it on for an hour it is a natural
product you know you can leave it on as
long as you want
the manuka honey is a natural
antibacterial so it's going to clear
your skin of breakouts and it's also an
anti-inflammatory which is really good
if you have like pimples that you pop
often I know a lot of people like to
pick at their pimples if you're one of
those people manuka honey is great
because it's really gonna heal the skin
it's going to soothe it because it's
anti-inflammatory it contains amino
acids it helps your pores this is also
really really good for anti-aging and
what's great for me is that it's amazing
it's an amazing moisturizer honey is
very very moisturizing so it's really
gonna retain your moisture and help that
regular 100% raw natural honey is good
too but manuka honey has been shown to
have a lot more antibacterial properties
now the bee venom has been is kind of
like a collagen booster or like a
wrinkle reducer I don't know because I
haven't used it long enough to really
tell you those things but it's supposed
to firm the skin help fine lines and
wrinkles it's supposed to increase blood
circulation and firm the skin so this is
an all-natural product and it has been a
great face mask in my skincare routine I
highly highly recommend checking out
100% raw manuka honey and bee venom by
the way a lot of people on I heard calm
said that they purchased this to help
their arthritis or to help joint pain
and a lot of people were saying it
really helped them so if you're someone
who suffers from that take a look at
this as well it's not only good for the
skin on the outside
okay I'm sorry I feel like I was talking
about that products for a really long
time now I'm going to try to breeze
through the rest of it this is my next
favorite and it's something that I'm so
happy I discovered this is the Too Faced
cocoa contour chiseled to perfection
face contouring and highlighting kit I
love this I don't use my Anastasio one
nearly as much anymore it's I just care
I love this one so much more this has
less product the anastacio one has six
and this has four but I still like this
one more has the shade like cocoa medium
cocoa dark cocoa and this little guy
right here called pop of light I think
so I do not like this one called pop of
light this is their highlighter this is
the only thing in this kit that I wish
was different it's supposed to be like a
face highlighter but honestly it's a
powder with a bunch of glitter in it and
I don't like highlighting with glitter I
don't I don't understand why they put
that in there
but the rest is top-notch phenomenal
that I can look past that like cocoa is
what I use to set my under eye concealer
and I don't know if you can tell but the
glow that's right here like in the
center of my face is this it sets the
concealer so it does increase but then
it gives you a beautiful like
highlighted look underneath the eyes
really similar to Mac's emphasized
really similar I contour my face using
the medium cocoa shape you can see that
it is a cool tone bronzer but it's not
ashy I love it that's what I use today
to contour my cheekbones and it chisels
your face and it makes it amazing and
then I use the dark cocoa to warm up my
face it's actually what I used on top of
my contour today to give my face that
wore me glowy
worried glowy look and I used that in my
crease as well so I am just over the
moon obsessed with this a mascara
game-changer for me is the Maybelline
lash sensational mascara I am like the
last person to jump on this bandwagon
but I decided to try a different
drugstore mascara one day when I was
walking around Walgreens and I decided
to pick this up because my cousin said
it was really good and I loved it I
usually hate rubber bristles
on my mascaras and I usually hate when
they curve like that but this one is
fantastic it gives me a lot of volume it
does give me a lot of length it's like
the best of both worlds I find that it
does hold a curl and it's easy to take
off at the end of the day which I can
appreciate because I hate anything
that's hard to remove I hate it I feel
like I'm talking about a lot of game
changers right now but these are major
game changers in the makeup world these
are the makeup forever step one
skin equalisers aka face primers they
did send me all of them all the ones
that they came out with but these are my
three personal favorite this one is the
smoothing primer I am wearing it today
in conjunction with this hydrating one
but this is phenomenal
I usually don't love those benefit
Porefessional type of primers and though
they're really great for filling in the
pores and sometimes I feel like oh my
god my pores look very visible and I
need a primer like that this one is so
good because it doesn't over dry like it
doesn't dry out my skin and it makes my
skin flawless like baby smooth just like
one even texture it's incredible I
actually have this guy right here the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
and I hate it it literally crumbs up
into little balls on my face and it
dries out my skin but this one doesn't
do that I am crazy about it the other
two I love are the hydrating one and the
redness correcting one this one I wore
non-stop when I had a really big rash on
my face I used some weird oil that broke
me out into a big red rash and the only
thing that minimized my redness before I
put on makeup was this no other red
reducing primer worked just this and it
really subsided my redness and then of
course I do have dry skin and this
hydrating one is amazing they do have a
nourishing one that I don't like nearly
as much this one feels like you are
putting a full glass of water on your
face I don't know how to explain it it's
like your skin drinks a whole glass of
water when you use this
so a major thing that happened in the
month of April if you guys have been you
know watching my channel you would have
known that I came out with my own
foursome in collaboration with
colour-pop and of course it's going to
be a monthly favorite of mine because
it's a major thing that happened in my
life and it did happen this month and I
just want to thank every single person
who has supported me on this journey
even those of you who did not purchase
it those of you who don't live in the
United States or can't get it who are
still supporting me even if you do live
in the United States and don't purchase
it but you watch my channel and support
me I freaking love you so much for those
of you who did purchase it thank you as
well I mean the constant support means
the world to me I really really am so
proud of it and some of the colors
people don't like but I really really
love it these colors scream my name and
everything that I represent and the warm
bronze enos and I just I love it so much
I will link the foursome down below just
in case you want to check it out
so my next favorite is another color pop
item and these are the color pop super
shock cheek highlighters you need to
pick up lunch money because it's amazing
it's so frosted but like in a shimmery
way not in a glittery way at all it's so
intense but you could go really light
hand with this or like put it on and
look like Jennifer Lopez for real like
Jenny from the block for real these
highlighters are all super pigmented
super buttery and smooth and the formula
is unbeatable there are only eight
dollars and you get a lot of product and
these suckers will last for a long time
because I mean they're so beautiful you
just had to give lunch money a quick
mention because it's my favorite but I
do have another highlighter I want to
talk about and this one is two dollars
this is technically a bronzer but this
is the elf sunkissed glow bronzer in the
shade sunkissed this is two dollars on
the elf website and at Target or
whatever it's such a beautiful golden
like I can't put leave this is $2.00
it's the highlight I'm wearing on my
face today like the golden one she and
you see on my cheeks it's this guy right
here they do have another shade that I
don't own and I kind of want to but it's
a lot darker but holy guacamole this
highlighter is beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful okay so really
quickly I'm gonna talk about blushes and
I feel like I have been liking blush a
lot more than I used to and if you guys
can tell watching my videos I don't
really like like blush I like very
subtle very soft blushes on my face and
why am I talking so much with my hands
today and I want to give this guy a
quick mention because it is life I love
this this is the Clinique cheek pop
blush pop in the shade nude pop I love
the packaging it has like this acrylic
thick rim and this is what it looks like
on the inside
it's a beautiful flower and what's great
about these blushes besides like the
color and stuff is this is not just like
a flower that eventually fades after you
put your brush in there a bunch of times
like the stamping is real like that
flower will stay there I love this
because it does last a really long time
on my face and the pigmentation is
beautiful it's a peachy nude which is my
favorite kind of blush honestly but I
feel like I don't have anything quite
like this one there's something special
about it
it has a soft like glow to it it doesn't
have a shimmer or glitter in it but it's
glowy on the cheeks and I love it I do
want to pick up melon pop as well after
trying this one and loving it so much
two other blushes I want to mention
they're both from the drugstore and both
from the same line these are the Revlon
powder blush powder blushes okay the
Revlon blushes this one is in the shade
nodding noon and this one is Oh baby
pink my favorite one out of both of them
I hate the way that it's just like a
rectangle strip drive me nuts
but my favorite one of both of them is
this one in knotty nude it's a nice nude
again my favorite this is really
pigmented and last a long time on the
skin for some reason and the swatches
that I'm showing you it doesn't look as
pigmented as it applies on the cheeks
very very strange
at least this one is this one I was
pleasantly surprised when it wasn't as
pigmented as I thought it was gonna be
and I know you're thinking like why
would that surprise you pleasantly but I
love that this isn't as pigmented as it
looks on the pan because when you put
this on your face it gives a light baby
pink glow it's like a serious glow I
don't know how it does it because it
doesn't have shimmer or glitter but your
face like your cheeks are glowing with
like a beautiful spring baby pink mist I
don't know I love these blushes okay so
I'm going to show you something that is
going to change the game for
self-tanning for women all over the
world this is the Josie Maran
self-tanning mitt it came with this I
bought this at the vib sale and I forgot
to show it to you guys but this is the
Josie Maran Argan liquid gold
self-tanning oil and it comes with this
freaking fantastic mint I'm gonna be
completely honest I haven't even tried
this yet but this I used it yesterday to
tan my body and um I could pretty much
throw every glove out the window from
now on nothing has ever compared to this
glove I don't know how to explain it
it's the best it's like super good
quality it has like this on the inside
which makes it easy to hold on to your
glove doesn't like fly off and it's like
streak free amazing and I know people
buy this set mainly for this but honey
this is good this is really good
mark my words every youtuber who
self-tans will be talking about this
glove watch okay two more things before
I go I'm actually gonna start something
else on my channel um kind of like a
random favorites of the month where I
talk about books songs fashion food um
stuff like that things that are not
Beauty I'm gonna start doing that I was
really quick
talk about my don't sweat the small
stuff book that changed my life I'm not
even joking this book is unreal I'm not
going to go into detail in this video
because I will talk about it in my
random favourites I just want to let you
guys know I know that was like such a
tease but I just wanted to let you guys
know that I will be doing that
once a month on my channel besides my
beauty favorites I'm going to talk about
other random favorites as well so stay
tuned for that video because that should
be coming up very soon okay so scratch
that not two more things because I'll
talk about the book in that video but my
last favorite is this right here this
brings back so many memories you guys
have no idea this is the pink the
Victoria's Secret body splash in warm
and cozy body mist excuse me now body
splash body mist I used to wear this in
high school every single day like after
PE I would just spray this on and and I
completely forgot that they even made
this but I was in Victoria's Secret
looking for something and I saw this and
I was like oh my god they changed the
packaging I used to have the old
packaging like that's how long ago I
used to wear this and I just remembered
how much I loved this it says it's
toasted vanilla and peony peony I can't
say that and it smells so intoxicating
it's definitely a warm sweet fragrance
for very warm at the same time and it
looks like I barely even dented it
because it's like kind of strong to
where I only need one spray here and one
spray here and I can smell it on me
for a long time after that it's intense
and beautiful and it's perfect just like
throw in a bag and a gym bag or
something I love this scent they have a
bunch of different ones but my favorite
one from this little line is definitely
warm and cozy go give it a sniff okay so
that was everything I was loving in the
