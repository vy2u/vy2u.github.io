my monthly favorites video we are gonna
be discussing everything I was loving in
the month of April if you hear some
background noises I'm sorry there's
actually people in my living room right
now eating Chinese food and watching a
basketball game but I had to pause and
come film a video just because I didn't
have a video up on Friday which I'm very
very sorry but I got the stomach virus
and turns out there's like a bug going
around because when I went to Urgent
Care the nurse was like man five people
have come in because they have a stomach
virus but I'm feeling so much better
thank you to everyone who was tweeting
me to get role soon everybody who was
telling me on my Instagram thank you
guys so much I really appreciate it I'm
doing much better it was kind of like a
48-hour thing but today I was like you
know what I'm gonna film I'm gonna take
off my super chips nail polish and I'm
just gonna sit down a film let's get
into the products I've been living so my
first favorite I totally feel like some
of you guys saw this coming but I have
been obsessed obsessed with the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer in the shade
of sweet tea I don't think they make any
other shade but this is called sweet tea
it's their baked luminous glow bronzer
and I freakin freaking love this this is
pretty much the only bronzer I've been
using since I got it I got this bronzer
in the mail which I've been dying to try
- this is the beach bronzer from urban
decay but I've just been loving this so
much that I just don't use it anything
else I love it because it has kind of
like a shimmery cool tone bronzer and
then kind of like a shimmery warm
bronzer here on this side and when you
mix them together you get such a
beautiful neutral bronzed glow and you
can kind of mix it together or dip into
either one it's stunning especially for
spring and summer it gives your face a
natural glow I'm wearing it today I only
used a little bit but I just love how
this makes my skin look the only thing
is it is kind of bulky and it's not like
in a compact you know it doesn't have a
mirror but product is so good I look
past it my next favorite is an eyeshadow
that I didn't think I was gonna love as
much as I do this is from colour-pop and
it's one of their new colors for spring
it's in the shade waddles
I love this color my favorite color pop
eyeshadows are the ones that have like a
super pearly finish or a very metallic
or a glittery finish I like their
statins and mattes as well but not as
much as the intense one this is a satin
it's the only eye shadow I'm wearing on
my eyes today I do have NARS hot sand
my highlight on my brow bone under my
inner corners but on my lid and in my
crease this is the only thing I have
right now and it's amazing it's the
perfect dusty rose shade I have a whole
tutorial where this is the main focus I
will link it down below it's so pretty
for this time of year because it's so
it's like pink and rosy but it has a
dustiness to it so pretty it has like a
very slight sheen to it which makes it
so stunning on the lid and my favorite
thing about this is you could pack this
on the lid and then you could slowly
bring it into the crease and it kind of
makes like a softer peachy effect when
you use very little of it kind of looks
like I have a different color in my
crease but I don't it's just this with a
light hand love this eye shadow I've
been using it to death so I can't tell
you how often I use a product for the
first time and I don't like it but then
the more I use it the more I start
liking it and then I end up loving it
and that happened with this product the
first time I used this I did not like it
this is the glossy a stretch concealer
in the shade light I've heard so many
people talk about glossier that I placed
an order online and I have been slowly
using every single thing I ordered I
even talked about the balm calm in my
last favorites video this wasn't my
favorite the first time I used it I was
like wow this is a very emollient
concealer it's just a little bit too
dewy so it kind of threw me off but the
more I started to use this the more I
fell in love with it and now the things
I hated about it are the reasons why I
love it so much if you have very dry
skin this is going to be your best
friend it's a paw concealer that isn't
drying it I don't know if you could tell
in the pot like it even looks dewy it's
a beautiful dewy concealer I use just
underneath my eyes and on my entire face
like I use this on my no makeup makeup
days whenever I don't wanna wear
foundation I have just like warmed it up
on my finger I rub my finger in there
obviously I wash my hands really well
then I put my finger in there and then I
start dabbing it underneath my eyes on
my lids in between my eyebrows around my
mouth wherever I have like redness and
then I'll just blend it in and it looks
so fresh and natural and just like if
your skin is naturally like that
I don't know I feel like this is magic
concealer for dry skin even when you
said it it still looks beautiful but you
do have to set this this is like
cela that you have to set right away
because I'm not it will crease
underneath the eyes because it is so
emollient it's not greasy or tacky or
gross it's just beautiful for those of
you with dry skin I highly recommend it
a blush I have fallen in love with I
didn't even know they made this one
until I saw it the other day this is the
wet and wild color icon blush in apricot
in the middle pad this formula for a
long time but I'm pretty sure this is a
new color and Wow
I think is my favorite color that they
have this formula is amazing if you've
never tried the color icon blushes from
one a wild or have you been they're
amazing they're like three bucks and
they're so pigmented you really do have
to use a light hand because they're very
pigmented this one I find that you don't
have to use that much of a light hand
I'm wearing this blush today and my
favorite way to apply this is with like
a little stippling brush like this this
is the Sigma f15 and I just like thus
this on my cheeks this color gives the
prettiest peachy golden glow and it's
another one of those products that looks
beautiful when I'm really fair and when
I'm tan as well and even though it looks
like it has like glitter in it it
doesn't come off chunky on the skin it
just looks like a beautiful sheen I love
this blush okay so now I quickly want to
talk about a couple of lip products of
course I have to give a shout-out to the
new Oprah liquid lipsticks in
collaboration with Manny
I love these shades they're beautiful I
think Manny did a great job in the color
selection my favorite one is definitely
hype now so up my street I love this
color this color is everything like
everything and over came out with new
packaging for their liquid lipsticks I
love them they look so high-class like
so elegant and very fancy and they're
very like they're weighted beautiful
beautiful beautiful like packaging
update I think it's awesome I love these
colors congratulations Manny they are
beautiful I'm into these like rosy tones
love it I'm actually wearing Jeffrey's
are Gemini on my lips right now another
favorite so beautiful such a beautiful
color another lip product that's in the
rosy tone family you guys need this lip
liner in your life you need to go to
Walgreens on your next off day and find
this lip liner I love it this is the
Jordana easy liner for
lips in the shade sugar bronze for some
reason I had never seen this color
before and I was looking at the Jordana
section the other day and I picked it up
and I'm so glad I did I'm wearing this
lip liner underneath Gemini this lip
liner is special though because it's not
like a flat matte color
it's a rosy brown shade but it has a
little bit of dimension not glitter or
shimmer or anything but it has a little
bit of something I don't want explain it
on the lips especially alone like if you
wear this lip liner by itself it looks
so pretty it looks like it has like
dimension to it I don't want explain it
it does look sugary and bronzy it's
beautiful it's not metallic by any means
but I love the undertone in this it
looks beautiful under so many nudes so
many Browns so many like dusty colors
you need this in your life
okay so we are almost done I'm gonna
talk about another wet and wild product
because this is limited edition and even
though I've only been loving it for like
about two weeks you need it you need it
it's beautiful this is the wet and wild
mega glow highlighting powder in the
shade precious petals they also have
another one that's pinkier and a little
bit deeper like more bronzy for deeper
skin tones it's also a really beautiful
tube but more like a blush topper on me
this one is more highlighting on me I
will say it looks better on me when I
have a tan when I'm a bit more fair it
kind of looks a little bit too dark but
it still looks pretty either way right
in wild you have stepped it up look at
this like beautiful pattern it has like
a tropical flower in it this reminds me
of a high-end highlight it's so smooth
it's so buttery creamy I don't know why
it's limited edition they need to make
this permanent because it is a flawless
highlight this is like one giant step
for drugstore in my opinion when it
comes to highlight because it's just so
smooth and pretty I'm wearing it on my
face right now and it just gives you a
natural golden goddess II glow run to
your local Walgreens try to find this I
also hear a lot of people have been
finding it at Rite Aid if you have a
writer near you you need to go get this
it's limited edition so try to get it
while you can okay I want to talk about
a nail polish even though I'm not
wearing any nail polish right now this
is SC's virgin snow I bought this at
Walgreens I don't know if this is a new
color or what but I was just sitting
there and it was like calling my name
and I decided to buy and I'm so glad I
did this color is unique
some reason I always get shades that
look kind of similar to this but this
one stands out among the rest I have a
lot of nail polish so I don't really
like to paint my nails the same color
twice I try to utilize everything in my
collection but when I was taking this
nail polish off I was like oh my god all
I want to do is put this color back on I
even got my mom one because when she saw
my nails she was like oh my god I love
that color so I bought her one
she's been loving it and it's crazy
because ESI's not my favourite formula
Essie chips on me really easily but I
accept it for this color because it's
amazing okay two more products I have
been using this a lot on my hair
recently and I feel like it's made of
such a difference this is the bamboo
shine luminous shine mist by the brand
alterna it's just basically that a shine
spray but what I love about this shine
spray is that it doesn't shoot out in
like a squirting motion you get like a
very fine mist and it makes your hair
look so shiny like coats your hair
evenly it doesn't make it look greasy in
one little spot and it just makes your
hair look so healthy and so shiny but a
lot of you guys have been complimenting
how shiny my hair's been looking and I
feel like a lot of it has to do with the
shine mist not only does it look shiny
but it makes my hair a little bit softer
as well I've been loving this I bought
this at Sephora and it just makes my
hair have a little bit of a glossy look
without making it greasy or like
weighing it down okay and then the last
product is something that ever since i
hobbled it you guys have been asking me
like every day like so did you like it
did you like it tell me tell me tell me
all about it this is the foreo luna -
this is the one for sensitive skin and
you're thinking right now obviously if
it's in a favorites video it must be a
favorite no it's not a favorite it's a
freaking favorite at first I was super
hesitant to buy it because it's such a
pricey product forever I didn't think
this was necessary but oh my gosh for
those of you who don't know what this is
I bought this at Sephora during the vib
sale and you basically it's something
you used to wash your face very similar
to the Clarisonic only not similar at
all but you know what I mean it's a tool
to wash your face and it gives you
instructions when you buy it but you
have like a plus sign a negative sign
here to kind of control like how
strongly you want it to bite right
because it does vibrate when you press
this button can't you hear that he's
vibrating and then you start to massage
it in your face obviously with the face
wash and then it kind of pull seats so
you can switch cheeks like you'll start
here it pull seeds you'll switch your
cheek do it for a little while it poll
say said you'd you like your forehead
and stuff like that and I haven't been a
huge fan of the Clarisonic I feel like
it's a little bit too abrasive for me
and I thought this was such a gimmick
the first time I used this guy I wish I
would have gotten it on camera when I
touched my face I felt like I was
touching a Cabbage Patch Kid I'm like oh
my god
I don't know how to explain the feeling
but it felt like it was perfectly clean
soft skin like nothing was in my pores
it was just perfectly smooth and baby
soft I've been using this non-stop every
single day I don't know if it's improved
my skin in other areas but in the
texture like the way my skin feels I
feel like it has improved that a lot I
did buy a dupe on Amazon I think it's
called the solo meal or something like
that I'm actually gonna start using that
one for about a month and then I'm gonna
do a whole video to see if this is worth
it or if the dupe is just as good but
you do have to give me like a month to
use that one because I want to give that
one a fair shot as well for those of you
who have been asking me if I love this I
do I personally love this this has
really helped my skin and it has an
irritant in my skin I guess it's because
I bought the one for sensitive skin I
love this thing I do I'm sorry I do okay
