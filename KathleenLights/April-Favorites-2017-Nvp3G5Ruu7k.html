wait I'm pretty sure by the time you're
watching this video I'm already back
from my YouTube break I am posting a
video before this one because this video
is going up on a Monday and I'm pretty
sure I posted a video on Friday
it's so weird thinking ahead because
right now I'm currently pre recording
this because I'm going out of town so
technically the week I took off I really
didn't take off I was pre recording for
this week that we are currently on the
rest of this week will have pre-recorded
videos but I'm back even though I am pre
recording I just want to thank you guys
for giving me the time to just to
refocus and to just like not stress so
much you guys know I had a biopsy done
and I just wanted to take the week to
chill I got it on my boob and I wanted
to take care of the wound but I was
saying even though I was pre recording I
still felt very relaxed this week
because I didn't have to edit for Monday
Wednesday and Friday since I was taking
that week off so thank you guys for
understanding me and for just letting me
take off like pretty much two weeks I
needed it but we are back to our regular
scheduled programming while you're
watching this video I'm currently on
vacation for Danny's birthday but when I
come back from vacation I plan on really
putting a lot of effort into my channel
but we all need a break sometimes I just
want to say thank you for allowing me to
have one so I love you guys and yeah
today's video is actually going to be my
April favorites I'm going to be sharing
with you all the products I was living
in April and I have to be honest since
I'm pre recording this video it's not
even the end of the month yet for me
right now
and honestly this week the only time
I've been wearing makeup is when I sat
down to film a video so for the entire
week I wasn't really wearing makeup I
only have a few favorites but these guys
I really love and I've been enjoying
them so yes eleska started so recently
for eyeshadow I have been dabbling into
the morphe 35o palette it's their newest
palette that has a ton of Browns and
bronzes and golds and I've been loving
that palette but I haven't been loving
it enough for me to include it in a
monthly favorites because I just
recently got it and I've only played
around with it a few times but when I
haven't been using that one I have been
using this one and I have I blow I love
it this is the joseph's colors baked
Browns eyeshadow palette in my last
monthly favorites video I spoke was in
my last one yes yes I spoke about the LC
minimalist palette and I still love that
I use that all the time but if I'm going
to be honest I have just been reaching
for this one more I just like to
some new products and this one is my
goal - at the moment I love this and I
love this for similar reasons that I
love the LC minimalist palette I love
that it's so sleek and compact because
it's just so easy to travel with and you
get a mirror and the palette is just so
small and they're all colors that I
would normally use anyway they're all
Browns but they're all really useful
like I use this one all the time
underneath my brow bone I have this
color in my crease and then I have this
pinky brown all over the lid I love this
pinky brown shade
I love pinky Browns on the eyes they're
like my favorite and then this one is
awesome it's a really deep reddish brown
and then you have like the classic
chocolate color that goes with
everything I actually have this color
like smudged really close to my lashes
to create kind of like a soft smudgy
eyeliner the only thing that sets this
one apart for my LC one is that that one
has a black but this Brown is so dark
that I make it work I don't really need
a black in this palette believe it or
not they also have a purple one called
marvelous mauve but of course I prefer
the brown one the only thing I will say
about this is that these eyeshadows are
very very soft eyes shadows there's a
kind that when you put your brush in a
lot of kick up comes up they like with
powder but all you have to do is tap
your brush off make sure that excess
powder falls off the brush and then use
it like that and they're just so
pigmented even tapping off the brush you
get so much pigment on the eyes I sit
there and I blend these out and even
when I apply too much where I feel like
there's a harsh line I could always
blend it out these are one of the
easiest eyeshadows to blend but I did
want to mention that because I know
there are some people who don't like a
soft eyeshadow but I don't mind it I
really really love this palette my next
favorite is a blush that I've had
forever but I never really use it until
a few weeks ago and I love this little
thing I guess I never really used it
because it just reminds me of like a
little eyeshadow it's so small but this
is a shea moisture mineral blush in
peach coral I love how buildable this
blush is you guys know me you know I
don't like an intense blush I don't I
think it looks so pretty on some people
but on me it just doesn't look like
intense blush looks terrible on me but I
love that with this you can get a really
intense peach look to the cheek or it
can be really soft and natural and yeah
you can say that about any blush all you
have to do is build it up but
blushes are really pigmented right off
the bat it just gives you the most
beautiful soft peach look I love it it's
so perfect for spring and it's also
going to look really beautiful in the
summertime it's like really bronzy skin
I love peach blush it's like my favorite
blush color to wear I love the formula
it's very soft but it is a matte blush
and it looks matte on the face but it
doesn't look drying or anything like
that it's not like a cakey powdery blush
I'm wearing this blush on my face today
and I don't know if you can tell I
applied very little but I like the look
it gave me definitely try this out I
picked this up at Target I believe or
was it alta I don't remember why I
bought this but I absolutely love it
okay my next product is really strange I
don't I don't
okay let me explain this is the dr.
Brandt pores no more Luminizer primer I
don't know if you guys are familiar but
dr. Brandt has a pores no more primer
that I do really like even though I
don't love those I really like the dr.
Bratton one because sometimes my pores
look a little crazy and I love putting
that one like right here to really like
so then poke but this one this one is
brand new and this is their Luminizer
primer and I don't know what it is about
this but I really like this primer and
it's a strangest thing because okay it
comes out and like this champagne color
and when you blend it out it really just
blends out into nothing it has a very
soft living apply more it has a very
soft luminous look to the skin like I
don't know if you could even see that
there it's very subtle but it is such a
nice base for makeup I don't know what
is in this but every time I apply this
and I apply foundation on top not orwhat
foundation I'm putting on my skin just
looks smoother versus like a regular
luminizing primer and I don't know if
this is supposed to fill in your pores I
don't really notice it filling in the
pores but I will say that when I put on
my foundation on top my skin looks
awesome my skin looks really smooth like
I said I don't know I'm still trying to
figure this guy out because I love the
end result I love how my makeup looks
like at the end when I use this but when
I'm applying it to my skin initially it
doesn't look like anything special but I
don't know I feel like it kind of does
magic a little bit or am I crazy I don't
know
I have been using this non-stop since I
got it so that is why I wanted to
mention it in this video whenever I've
been using a primer this month it's been
missed okay so the next product I want
to talk about are kind of like a combo
I've been doing with me and I'll explain
so this is like my little drugstore
combo I've got going on when I want to
look really glowy but not really glowy
in my t-zone okay so recently fix me
sent me their hydrating milky mist and I
had had this in the past but I finished
it and then or at least I thought I
finished it I don't know what I did with
it but I hadn't use it in a while and
when I saw they sent this to me I was
like oh my god yes I missed this so much
and I haven't been doing this all month
obviously I haven't been wearing makeup
all month but I have been loving this to
set my makeup and not setting it so that
it could last longer but setting it so
that it could look less powdery and just
so it can give me a really youthful glow
because this doesn't prolong the wear of
your makeup I use other setting sprays
for that and I have my tatcha luminous
dewy skin mix that I love a lot and that
I use all the time but this one is
actually very very similar and it's much
much sheet but you can get these at the
drugstore
well Target not sure what else they sell
pixie and it says that they use
preserving mist I love the mists on this
is so fine and a lot of it comes out but
it's just like like set your skin
perfectly it takes away that powdery
look while it gives you the most intense
beautiful like JLo glow and it does have
like that milky consistency as you can
see but it doesn't leave like little
dots on your face like that Marc Jacobs
coconut won a setting spray no bueno and
every time I do this I've just been
using this right in my t-zone because
line set my entire face with it I look
really dewy I mean I apply a lot of this
and I look really religious and even
though I have a super dry chisel and I
don't necessarily want it to look oily
you know and I feel like sometimes when
you have like this part of your face you
know you're teasing when that part looks
too dewy it it can look a little oily so
what I've been doing after I set my
entire face with it I fan it I wait for
it to dry and once it's completely dry
I'll go in with my Catrice prime and
fine mattifying powder and this is
waterproof and it's transparent I love
this because it is very mattifying but
it doesn't look flaky and dry on my skin
which I can really appreciate since my
pees own is already dry I mean
I put that milky mess on it ain't dry in
a moat but this mattifies it without it
making it look dry and I love that I'll
just get a little brush like this tap it
into the product not too much that I'll
get a little bit and then I will just
set these areas right here here yeah and
it's awesome because it will mattify
that part but the rest stays looking
nice and dewy because of the mist so
yeah I just wanted to mention that I've
been doing that and I've been using this
little combo to be super glowy but not
look oily you know so I really have been
liking these ok so my next favorite is
this guy right here if you hear
construction by the way if I'm going
down out there lots of construction
happening sorry for the noises but this
is my other favorite of the month then
is a Marc Jacobs coconut gel highlighter
in the shade do you these are there do
drops and when I first tried this I
hated it I absolutely hated it because
the way I used it was I used it on top
of my foundation I tried to use this as
a liquid highlighter and it looked
terrible on my skin I felt like it kind
of moved the foundation underneath and
it looked really weird and patchy once
it's set because the thing with this
product is it is a liquid highlighter
but once it sets it sets it like doesn't
move but then I tried it mixed in with
my foundation and I fell in love with it
I love mixing this in with my foundation
I cannot stop I will not stop I'm
obsessed
today I mixed it in with this foundation
I'm wearing this one on my face this is
the number 7 listing luminate foundation
you guys know I love this and today I'm
wearing this combo on my face and I love
how this looks mixed in with foundation
because it gives you such a beautiful
glow but it doesn't make you look greasy
or oily it won't make a matte foundation
feel really dewy and hydrating all it's
going to do is give the foundation a
like shimmer kind of like a sheen not
like a glitter but it has like a sheen
to it and it's just going to give your
face an overall like subtle sheen like
when you move your face I love it
because it's the perfect foundation
mixer with luminous foundations with
matte foundations with any it's going to
give your skin a very subtle glow but
not like a wet oily glow like a natural
Sheen ok so I have discovered a new
eyeliner I really love I have been
putting these to the test for a couple
of months now
and I love them I don't love them as
much as I love my Marc Jacobs eyeliner
like the matte ones
sherilyn they're good but the matte ones
are my favorite I don't love these as
much but I almost do which is nice
because these are drugstore these are
the NYX fold blacks and full white
eyeliners I really like these full
whites but I don't like them as much as
I like the faux black these are amazing
the difference is that these like the
faux whites come in like really light
colors like pastel blue pesto green
pesto pink and then the faux blacks come
in like darker colors like a dark brown
a black these two are different purple
ones I don't know where the rest of mine
are like the rest of my faux blacks I
have a few more I don't know where they
are but I use this one in the shade
blackberry in my purple makeup tutorial
that I posted not too long ago and I
find it's really easy to apply it's
really creamy you guys know I love the
NYX pledge you later I think I really
think they exchanged them and just
repurchase them and I feel like they're
a little bit drier but as of right now
these are hitting it out of the park for
me these do not smudge they do not budge
they last forever at least on my eyes
they last forever I love them so much I
highly recommend them they are amazing
speaking of things that have been
changing I recently tried the pure
cosmetic sponges I got in my boxycharm
and I'm telling you
pure change there sponge pier had to
have changed their sponge mine was so
stiff not balancing and squishy like
their original not at all
pier what is that about I don't know if
you changed it but change your back okay
that sponge is awesome and like my new
one is like solecism
anyway so the last thing I wanted to
talk about in today's video is this bad
boy home at MU Omega this I love this
book this is the NARS highlighting
palette and it is called bunk disable
and no can read the language I know what
that says but it is their new
highlighting palette and it is stunning
absolutely stunning I have been using
this one and the Oprah Rodeo Drive
highlight a lot I got that one in my
boxycharm and ever since I got that
Oprah highlight I've been using a
non-stop but when I'm not using that one
I have been using this one and to be
fair I've been using this one more this
month this is like beautiful this is
like everything this is everything
it's that same formula that they have
for their crap what is
the dual the dual intensity blushes I
see exact same formula as those blushes
where you can use these either wet or
dry I can just imagine how crazy these
looks when you wet them because using
them dry they are very intense I've
never even had to wipe them I have no
desire to what these highlights but you
absolutely can it's not going to mess
with the formula and these colors are
absolutely beautiful my favorite is the
one in the middle right here it's like
the most beautiful light peach highlight
ever the only one that is too dark for
me is this one but I've just been using
this one as an eye shadow all the time
I'm actually wearing this dusted on my
lids today I'm wearing the dose of
colors palette that's matte but I took
like a fluffy brush and just dusted this
color like on the lids I don't know if
you can tell but I mostly just dabble
into these two shades this one is so
light perfect for really really fair
skin I'm wearing the one in the middle
right here on my cheekbones today and
then I took this one right here and I
popped it right here
I don't know if you could tell but it's
like more intense right here I just
wanted like a little pop right here so I
took this shade and pop you right there
I don't feel like it emphasizes my
texture I don't think it looks too
chunky or too glittery I think it looks
really pretty it gives you a nice even
Sheen such a beautiful glow that's so
buildable and I love everything about
this palette and this is something that
a is very pricey but I personally think
is worth the money if you are going to
use all the shades and I find that I do
use all of them I find it so worth it I
love this highlighting palette okay so
