my April favorites these were products I
was loving in the month of April and I'd
have to be honest I don't have that many
products I actually don't have that many
makeup products I have a lot of non
makeup favorites this month and mainly
it's because I was traveling a lot in
April I'm doing a lot more traveling in
May actually I was just pretty much
using the exact same things I was using
last month I have a lot of the exact
same favourites from last month so I
didn't want to repeat myself but I also
didn't want to talk about products I
wasn't really loving so this one might
be a short one I mean who knows I will
turn these ten products into a 40 minute
video of course also I have a fake nose
ring on if you guys follow me on
Instagram you probably saw it weeks ago
when I posted that I was wearing this
while I was wearing a silver one but I
recently purchased on Amazon a bunch of
fake nose rings and I've been wearing
them recently and I don't know I like it
little story really quick I've been
wanting a nose ring since I was like in
middle school since like sixth grade
I've wanted one so bad I used to put a
little diamond on my nose in middle
school all the time like with Krazy Glue
like the good Diamonds little fake
diamonds on my nose all the time
did not look good but I thought I did
you know middle school even in high
school I really really wanted one so bad
but my fear of getting one was always
stronger like there's just something
about putting a hole in my nose
that freaks me out and I know I have
holes in my nose it's a nose but I
cannot get a nose ring like I will not
ever ever get a nose ring but I love
nose rings is that weird
so I feel like I can still follow my
heart but also keep my nose coldest so I
don't know I think it looks real I'm not
gonna be wearing this in every video
it's probably just gonna be in this
video I don't know I just was feeling it
with my red orange lip I just put it on
and yeah let's get started on this video
I have a new favorite foundation brush I
didn't think this day would ever come
the it cosmetics love is the foundation
brush has been my favorite foundation
brush for like two years now and it's so
funny because my new favorite brush is
also from it cosmetics I wouldn't say I
love this one more than my love is the
foundation brush but I love them about
the same and that's crazy to me I just
I love the brush like that this is one
of the eight brushes for Ulta so you can
only get this first exclusively at Ulta
but it's their airbrush full coverage
complexion brush number 77 pretty sure
this is brand new I just recently got an
MPR and there's something special about
this brush I've never really been into
those flat top kabuki type of brushes
colour-pop has one I can't grab it right
now color pop has one Sigma has one I
mean they're very popular foundation
brushes and people use them all the time
but for some reason I just always
preferred something that wasn't as stiff
or has flat I don't know but this one
this is a flat brush but I don't know if
it's the shape of it it has like a
really cool triangle type shape that
just fits perfectly in every crevice of
your face the shape of this is amazing
but it's not as stiff as those other
brushes it's very very soft almost
fluffy and it honestly does give you the
most full coverage foundation look
possible I kind of put it to the test I
did half of my face with my other
favorite foundation brush and I feel
like this one gave me a more flawless
full coverage look I don't know how it
does it but it does definitely check it
out the next time you're at Ulta I know
it is a pricey brush it cosmetics purses
are so expensive but they are really
good not all of them but this one this
one is amazing okay so last month I
spoke about my favorite single shadow it
was the Bobbi Brown one in heat-ray I
still use it all the time
but it kind of reminded me of my love
for Mac's wood winked because I used to
use wood winked on its own all the time
and it reminded me of that so I pulled
wood week back out of my collection
started using it again and and now I
cannot stop of course this is the eye
shadow I have all over my lids I've been
using this as a one-and-done i shadow
look I have my face highlight on my
inner corners but this is literally the
only thing on my eyes right now and I
love this because you can pack it on
your entire lid and it gives you a
really pretty soft golden bronze look
but you can get a fluffy brush and apply
it in the crease as well and it doesn't
look weird it's not like a very shimmery
eyeshadow it has a sheen to it but it's
not glittery or shimmery it really just
is like a glowy bronzed satin finish I
feel like I don't have other eyeshadows
that look exactly like this like I mean
it's a bronze eyeshadow typical
can find similar shades in other
palettes but I feel like wood winked is
special there's something about the
texture of it that I just I don't know I
really love it I've been using it almost
every day and it pairs so well with my
Clint colour-pop lippie I've been
wearing this a lot this month as well
I've been wearing all of my lip collapse
I know that's really annoying but I mean
I can't stop I made this color for a
reason I love wearing these shades so I
feel like wood winked and this color
just pairs so nicely it's so summery so
springy I love it so the callee contour
from smashbox has been my go-to contour
blush kind of situation for the past few
weeks because i've been traveling so
much like i've been taking this with me
like it because I feel like I have
everything I need in this one palette
and it is so sleek I love the mirror
when I was traveling I was using this
mirror a lot to do my brows to do my
face I hate holding a mirror I like
having it like propped somewhere but it
is a really great mirror besides the
packaging like I said in my recent video
I love every shade in this palette the
only one I don't use that often is this
one so it is really rare for me to like
everything I like this shade I mix these
two shades together to create a nice
contour it's actually what I use on my
face today to contour to bronze the
whole skin I am wearing the new a
cosmetics bye bye pours bronzer and I
also have this blush on my face right
now this is such a pretty blush it goes
with every single makeup look cool tones
warm tones
it's so nice anyway I've been loving
this palette it's great I'll go and I
feel like the formulas are really nice
everything blends really well I've kind
of been over-faced palettes like this
like I'm over contour kits I'm just over
all of it but recently I've been really
really liking this one it kind of
reminds me of my love for the Too Faced
cocoa contour kit do you guys remember
how much I used to love that palette if
you remember my love for that palette
you've been around for a long long time
alright so if you guys saw my what's in
my makeup bag my travel makeup bag you
would have seen all the colors I've been
wearing recently a month on my lips but
I have something else to talk about I
actually threw this in my bag last
minute
I'm in love with this I've always liked
this there's something about traveling
that really makes you put your makeup to
the test let me tell you and this is the
Maybelline vivid hot lacquer lip gloss
in the shade tease it's a very very nude
lip gloss but it is stunning this stuff
is very sticky very opaque it's a lot
it's very intense but I found that this
lasted all day on my lips loss usually
fades at least the glosses I'm used to
didn't really last that long on the lips
I applied my tar lip liner from
Maybelline and then I applied this on
top and it lasted all freakin day this
is such an intense lip gloss but it is
so good and if you've been looking for
something that's sticky that's gonna
last a long time on your lips this is
really good but I actually posted a
picture of me and my friend melody on
Instagram and I got so many questions
about the lip I was wearing in that
picture which is like a random picture
and I didn't have that much makeup on
but I had this lip color and it was
funny because somebody asked me what lip
I was wearing and I responded saying
that I mixed but I didn't that was
actually a day that I didn't mix my lip
color so I'm so sorry I gave you false
information this is what I was wearing
on my lips this is the nude Stix boho
lipstick it's one of their magnetic
matte lip colors and this is like my new
favorite nude I like it because it's
deeper than whisper it's deeper than
traditional nudes I wear I like adding a
bold lip color at least for me when I do
a little bit in other places I like
something bold on the lips but sometimes
I still want to do nude and I feel like
this is the perfect nude because it's
it's deep enough for me to kind of look
like a bold color but it's still a nude
color so that make sense I don't know
I've been loving boho a lot I have been
loving nude sticks a lot let me tell you
because my next product is also nude six
products this is their eye brow stylist
pencil and gel and I have mine in the
shade o ash brown yeah this is
definitely too ashy for my hair so I
don't really use the pencil part all
that much unless I'm in a hurry on the
go because whenever I'm out the door and
I'm leaving this is the only thing I'll
grab if I need to do my eyebrows like on
the go because it comes with a gel like
an eyebrow setting gel in this product
as well so you have your angled pencil
for your brows and then you have the gel
on this side this is one of those angled
kind of like square triangle type tips I
used to be really into
but then I went back to my traditional
browse style it's still really good
formula if you're into this type of tip
you will you will love this eyebrow
pencil because the formula is really
nice and it does last a long time on the
brows I just don't love this color I
need to get something that's not ash
brown maybe just like a neutral Brown
I don't think ash belongs in in my life
anything ashy I dye my hair 7 na which
is 7 neutral ash and it still comes out
warm I'm a warm girl but anyway the gel
on this is what I'm obsessed with this
is okay you guys know how I feel about
my colour-pop brow boss gel amazing my
Siobhan she gel amazing this is like
super glue real super glue for your
brows if you want that feathery brow
look but you really want your hairs to
stick up for real though like for real
for real this brow Joe sticks them up
make it makes them very hard actually so
if you don't like crunchy brows you're
not gonna like this like these are
crunchy brows but it's like glue like
it's literally hairspray when you go to
touch your brow it feels like hairspray
it leaves them very feathery all freakin
day and I don't always want that look
but whenever I want them to last all day
I've been using this and Duke this
really gets the job done I just noticed
that when I set my brows with this gel
my brows last longer throughout the day
than when I don't even like the color
underneath I don't know this is some
heavy duty freaking eyebrow gel it's
insane and I really like it okay so that
completes the make a portion of this
video the rest of the stuff is not
makeup I need to go a huge shout out so
this this is the bumble and bumble prep
a powder nourishing dry shampoo with
hibiscus extract for dry or damaged hair
there's my new fairy dye shampoo I love
this so much I wouldn't say it's my like
new new new fame thing for you wear dry
shampoo but it might be if we're at
freakin might be I just recently
purchased a big one on Sephora and
another little one cuz I'm completely
out of this this is the best rice
shampoo if you do have a very dry hair
because it doesn't leave your scalp very
dry but it does clean your scalp
I hate dry shampoos
put it in my hair and I'm like oh cool
that did nothing this doesn't do that
this does leave you with a nice clean
feeling to the hair but it almost feels
nourishing it's so strange I totally
understand what you mean like I didn't
get you in the beginning but I get you
it's amazing and it also doesn't leave
your hair with that white residue even
though it doesn't look like it with all
this white crap on this it kind of goes
on a little bit clearer like clearer
than I'm used to batiste is like a super
white dry shampoo this one doesn't do it
that bad I just love how it makes my
hair feel still clean but soft and the
scent is really really good on this like
your hair smells really nice I would
highly recommend you checking this out
if you have like damaged hair or your
hair is really dry you have dry scalp
but you still don't want to wash your
hair that often throughout the week I
recently went on the just arrived
section like about a month ago I think
I've been using this for about a month
now I saw this was available
I bought it I've been using it ever
since and I really really really like
this this is the Laneige eye sleeping
mask for all skin this is amazing if you
really need intense hydration and
intense moisture underneath the eyes I
said this about a trillion times but I
have very dry skin I'm only 26 and I
swear I see my skin like I feel like my
skin looks older than I am
like I get really wrinkly here you know
my smile lines like I just see I just
see the dryness really working against
me
if you have oily skin I know it's
frustrating to have to like stay matte
all day and have to go through that but
listen it's way better than having dry
skin okay you look old fast when you're
dry that's just the way it is can you
drink more water anyway this is supposed
to be an eye mask that you apply
underneath the eyes like an eye cream
and you leave it on overnight and it's
really gonna deep puff and hydrate the
eyes and yes that's exactly what this
does my holy grail eye cream is still my
Kiehl's midnight recovery eye that's the
best for dark circles and to really
remove the darkness but it doesn't
really hydrate or deep puff the eyes so
using this about twice a week I have
noticed a huge difference on my under
eyes they look so much softer so much
more hydrated just like just better and
it also has this really cool applicator
that you just rub it on the under eyes
tap it in with your ring finger and the
cooling mists of the
little wand is also really awesome like
the whole experience is really really
nice
I've been loving this and I had a
feeling I was really gonna like it
because their lips sleeping mass is my
favorite lip mask ever this little combo
and your lips and on your eyes well
hydration city it's amazing and I just
checked the Sephora website and this
thing is sold out so I'm sorry I didn't
know that was gonna happen I've been
wanting to talk about this Jordan for
like four months in a row and every time
I sit down to tone this video I forget
to grab it out of my bathroom this is
the paraben free and aluminum free
deodorant I've been on the hunt for one
that doesn't make me smell like a man's
dirty situation I could never find a
vegan you order in or like an aluminum
free order and I'm sorry that didn't
make me smell bad they all just kind of
worked for a few hours but then at the
end of the day I smelled a little bit
bad you know on my armpits you know they
just weren't working for me but when I
discovered this it was like the clouds
opened up and yeah I don't know where I
was going with that I wanted to say and
God said oh I hate you alfalfa but I
realized that just didn't match with
what I was saying anyway this is the
native deodorant it's from a brand
called Native I purchased this on their
website I tried out two different scents
this one and then a mint one I do not
like the mint one it works for a couple
hours like I said but at the end of the
day I didn't I didn't really like it
this one in coconut and vanilla guys
this is amazing this smells so good and
it leaves your armpit
smelling that way the entire day I went
to Disney World and it was like 80
degrees hot as okay so freaking hot I
was there all day and I still smelled
good I still smells good at the end of
the day that is unheard of with an
aluminum free Jordan at least for me so
when I smelled my armpits at the end of
day and I was like man I still smell
nice and French I was so blown away I
knew that was like the ultimate test and
I just knew me and you were meant to be
were meant to be together forever I will
never ever ever I'll never say never I
will not be using another deodorant
until I can find something better and
honestly I don't think I'm gonna find an
aluminum free deodorant that's better
than this coconut and vanilla keeps
manasa fridge okay so I'm actually going
to
quick shout out to the glossier you
perfume I mean that's the name of it
just says glossier you but I recently
purchased this because one of you guys
actually recommended it to me in one of
my comments and I ran and purchase it I
didn't even know glossier made a perfume
but when I got in the mail yeah I know I
bought it without even smelling it I'm a
wild card light light but when I got in
the mail I did not like it like I did
not like how it smells I was like you
know what it's nice it's pretty but it's
not for me but I I just sprayed it on
myself anyway and I wore it throughout
the day and I got so many compliments on
this damn perfume when I wore it that I
was really really shocked at like 10
people asked me what I was wearing and I
was like you can't be serious I don't
even like the smell the fact that
everybody liked it on me made me like it
like I grew to really like this perfume
and even now when I smell it I'm like it
doesn't smell like anything special I
don't know it's very fresh it does smell
good it does smell good it just didn't
blow me away but apparently this works
really well with my body chemistry and
people really like how it smells on me
but it just gives you a very fresh vibe
like you're just walking through a
spring like a Springfield metal like a
metal but it smells like a nice fresh
bath no no no no I'll leave the notes
like the notes of this perfume for you
right here if I can find them if I can
find the notes but I don't know I've
been using it a lot this month because
everybody seems to like it on me okay
and then the last products we want to
talk about is this so I don't know if
you guys have noticed but I haven't been
adding heat to my hair even the list of
the heat setting to let me get into it I
haven't been adding heat to my hair for
a while now I have just been doing the
whole natural thing because I really
want to lay off Leblon ciao like um my
flat iron I don't know why I just said
that in Spanish but I really want to lay
off the flat iron even though I love
straight hair I don't want to use it as
much but from so many years of ironing
my hair I mean I've been ironing my hair
every single time I've washed it since
the sixth grade
sixth grade so do the math that is years
years of flat ironing my hair so
obviously my curls have really died out
like they do my hair does not get as
curly not nearly as currently as it used
to in middle school or like when I was
younger so I've been having
use this but I only use this on the
hairs that frame my face so I wash my
hair like normal do my curly hair
routine and then when my hair is
completely dry I'll go in with this
curling iron which is a tiny skinny
little curling iron and then I'll just
do the little hairs around my face I
feel like it makes a huge difference I
don't touch any of my hair in the back
so I just do the hairs in the front and
then I don't touch it until I wash my
hair again so I never retouch with this
I try not to add more heat than I need
to like for example I it's been like a
week since I washed my hair well it's
been like five days I definitely need to
wash my hair tonight but I did the
little curls around my face like five
days ago and I haven't read touched I
haven't touched up which is why my hair
looks really crazy today
but that's okay I'm embracing the crazy
and I just really wanted to mention this
because I've gotten so many compliments
recently on my hair like on my car my
curly hair has been looking this I got
off Amazon and it was cheap um I know
that curling wands like on sephora.com
are like $200 but this is from a brand
called her styler first styler baby
curls mini curling iron and I think it's
like half an inch curling wand it was
twenty-two bucks it's totally worth it
because it minimizes the heat I put on
my hair so it's so worth it for me I
love it I don't think you need to spend
a lot on like a little curling iron like
this it does the job for me but anyway
before I wrap up this video I just
wanted a shield on shout out to my
bracelet this is from Co my sister's
jewelry line I love that I can wear
things like this now because I have a
very tiny wrist it's actually like
abnormally small I feel the other day I
was testing it against my ten-year-old
goddaughters wrist and her wrist is
thicker than mine I was a little bit
freaked out about that it doesn't look
like that on camera but I have like a
abnormally time your wrist and bracelets
never fit me I love this she has come
out with these kinds of bracelets that
you let you just do this like you know
no matter how thick your wrist is no
matter how thin your wrist is this
little stopper thing is freaking guts
and I love it and I love anything that
has to do with like the evil eye the
whole mod the whole thing I love it so
this is the little eye and I just I
don't know feel like I have something on
my wrist
amazing so I just wanted to give that a
cute little shout-out I will leave my
sister's jewelry website down below if
you want to check it out but anyway guys
that completes this video these were
products I was lucky in the month of
April

more makeup products to include I feel
like this month was kind of boring but
