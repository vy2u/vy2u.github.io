my monthly itse bag unboxing I haven't
done an Ipsy bag unbagging unboxing I
call it unboxing but I mean that doesn't
make sense
whatever I haven't done one of these in
like three months four months because I
mean I already explained it but oh let's
turn that off before I moved from
Mississippi I forgot to change my
address on the Ipsy website so it was
like getting sent to the wrong address
for like three months and I was being
charged for it too but anyway I already
fixed the problem I changed my address
and here we are
these ape see videos will continue every
month as long as I received them and I'm
still receiving them so let's jump right
in
so in my bag is this little lady right
here
I'll see you gir I see lustre Lux on
this little card simple cute I usually
just throw those but you know I won't
throw my girl across the room so this is
what the bag looks like this month it's
kind of like a bamboo ish material I
don't know if it's bamboo it probably
isn't but you know what I mean like that
material like a straw hat kind of
material so I'm just gonna - oh Beansie
bag right cuz that's what you're here
for
so instantly I am extremely excited
that's it I'm extremely excited I love
the bag just for this product this is a
Julie G nail polish which if you guys
don't know
Julie G is actually a youtuber here but
they sell this nail polish this Julie G
brand at Rite Aid only or at Jessie's
Girl cosmetics calm when I lived in
Mississippi I used to buy Julie G nail
polishes all the time but they don't
have Rite Aid in South Florida so I'm so
excited that they sent a Julie gene nail
polish and on the back it gives you like
a little coupon like a dollar off any
Jessie's Girl or Julie G product at Rite
Aid which I can't use that oh my gosh I
don't even have this color either in the
shade damsel Julie G is literally I'm
not kidding one of my favorite nail
polishes I love it just as much as
formula X and OPI it doesn't chip on me
it lasts long
good on my nails and OPI does actually
and I'm so excited
danzel I love it my internet isn't
working right now so I can look up the
prices of these products and I'm getting
really really upset my international
market all I know is that this is a
full-size product and I believe these
are around like four dollars four or
five dollars I'm not sure three four or
five dollars so the next thing in the
bag is this tiny little lipgloss this is
from the brand star looks and it's in
the shade cuddle cuddle
that's the shade so this is kind of like
a cute little size to just throw in your
purse I'm not a huge brand of shimmery
lip glosses and this is pretty shimmery
Wow no it is a really pretty color at
first it looks kind of like weird in the
bottle but like as i swatched it it
actually has a beautiful sheen it
doesn't feel chunky or anything on my
hands so this is great to just throw in
your purse I like the size next thing is
this chlorine dry shampoo and I've
actually heard a lot of people talk
about this and say that they really like
this dry shampoo I'm not exactly sure
how much this is this is obviously not
full-size but it says dry shampoo with
oat milk gentle formula for brown to
dark hair okay does it shoot out I
wonder if it shoots out like dark oh no
it does not oh wait use it it oh my god
how weird do you see that wait it's like
peach that is strange
I'm actually really excited about this
because it didn't shoot out white which
I have brown hair so that's really
really cool hmm I'm intrigued how this
would look with my darker darker roots
okay two more things in the bag
one is this mica Beauty cosmetics or
mica Beauty cosmetics eye primer so it
kind of is like a Mac painterly
paint-pot
of some sort let me feel it oh it feels
creamy but just stab my nail in there
feel it feels kind of dry honestly
actually now that I put it in the back
of my hand but that could be a good
thing it's like tacky I don't know I
definitely will try this out and let you
guys know I would be looking up the
prices but honestly my internet isn't
working
I hope my internet starts to work soon
because I need to upload this video um
but I would definitely use this in a
video and let you guys know if it's good
or not I'm pretty sure this is full size
as well okay and then the last thing
this is so cute
okay this is a mini nude eyeshadow by
the balm so you get a single eyeshadow
by the balm from their nude dude eyes
shadow palette which I actually own and
I freaking love I even love the nude
dude more than the nude tude if you guys
want me to do a nude dude makeup
tutorial let me know but I'm gonna go
kids like a little book I sell you boug
desu cute and it's actually the shade
flirty which is a really pretty all over
lid shade it's a nice like shimmery topi
purple that's really nice that's cute
that they included this a single
eyeshadow okay so that completes this
video that is everything I got in my
Ipsy bag this month I am extremely
excited I give this month a big thumbs
up I think it was great I think this is
cute I'm obsessed with Julie GL polish
and I'm really intrigued by this I'm
really I love the bag this month I think
it was really good let me know down
below what you got in your FC bag and if
you liked it this month or not so yeah
