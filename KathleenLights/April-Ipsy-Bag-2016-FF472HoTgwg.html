my Ipsy bag and bagging unboxing and
bagging it's a bag on Maggie I'm gonna
leave a little like annotation right
here of when the video actually starts
because I do want to talk to you guys a
little bit before I get into the video
but for those of you are strictly here
to see what's in this bag well then here
you go okay so clearly I'm still doing
FC videos if you saw my last empty bag
video it was more like an update video
but I asked you guys if I should
continue to post if si bag videos on my
channel I was kind of going back and
forth with the idea because I didn't
really like I wasn't very blown away by
it see recently and it's it's a video I
didn't think a lot of people were
enjoying and while a lot of people
agreed with me like a lot of people were
like yeah you know what just skip the
Itchy videos from now on they're not my
favorite a ton of people were like no
keep doing it see videos so I was super
torn for a while there I didn't know
what to do and then I got my other epsy
bag in the mail and I still don't know
what to do I pondered for a couple of
days but I decided to just sit down and
film it anyway for those of you who
really wanted to see it I try to please
everyone at the same time but everyone
is so different so obviously that's
never going to happen so for now I am
gonna continue to upload these videos
for those of you who really really
really wanted to see them also in case
you saw this look how random this is
okay this is a self-tanning mark like I
was using it like okay this is really
embarrassing for me to say but in a
disappointing products video I spoke
about the st. Tropez in shower ten or
how it was ridiculous and stupid and
very awkward it did nothing well they
came out with an inch shower tanner for
medium to deep skin tone and even though
it's a stupid product because you're
just standing with the shower off cold
for three minutes and it's really
awkward I bought it I bought the medium
to deep just to try it out and I tried
it out like you're supposed to put it on
your entire body while you're in the
shower wait three minutes and then rinse
it off completely and it's supposed to
be like a gradual ten
notice gradually well they woke up the
next day with this and I don't
understand why because I washed my
entire body like I didn't miss anything
it kind of looks like Cuba I don't know
really weird just in case you were like
uh your armpit is dirty no no it's just
stained okay so I think it's time to get
into the video I'm just going to hope
payment Oh ready then so has a cute
little card as use I christen Dominique
is on this card which is so she looks so
pretty in this picture very nice Venice
and then this is what the bag looks like
this one um it's cute I like the colors
it's fun spring shocking I like the
colors okay so the first thing in my bag
is this little guy right here this is
the skin bright eyes eye enhancing
eyeliner
you guys know that if see does not
include like the prices and a list on
their cards so it's kind of like a
guessing game really with Ipsy
I really wish they did that not even the
prices like I don't care if they don't
put the prices on the card at least this
is I hate this kind of packaging is so
hard to open but at least give a
description of what things are because
if you are a beginner if you're someone
like trying out oopsey for the first
time sometimes you don't know what
everything is you know what I mean some
people like an explanation and how to
use certain products you know oh my god
I'm gonna be here for three years
finally okay so I'm guessing the brand
is called skin Dmitry James and I'm
guessing it's like a nude liner yes I'm
very excited for this this is full size
obviously I'm really glad that they put
something like this in the bag because I
feel like this is something that
everyone can use it's a universal color
it's something that a lot of different
skin tones can wear cuz it's just a nude
liner so I really really like this
actually I mean I don't know how it
performs but like next thing in here is
it this little guy this is the tarte
lipsurgence lip cream in the shade
wonder it's kind of like a pinky red
don't
use these lip surgeons enough I have a
couple of colors this color is actually
really really pretty I'm actually very
excited to use this color like in the
packaging it looks pretty but swatched I
really really like this color these are
very creamy very hydrating I like that
this is little like I like that this
isn't a full-size because it's easy to
travel with or to throw in your purse
not exactly to travel with but just so
easy to carry with you and tart is a
great brand they have great products and
I really really like this too high-end
brand so it's it's cool to see it in
Ipsy and then I have two more products
in here I love this brand this is the
Moroccan oil treatment actually have
this in a full-size so I'm probably
gonna give this to one of my friends
because I just use the one I already
have but this is a great like oil I
think it has argan oil in it yes I love
the smell of Moroccan oil this is
obviously not full-size either but this
little bottle will last you a million
years like and then the last thing in
the bag usually we get like five
products but I think maybe because they
included like two pricier brands we got
four items I don't know this is the
jelly pong pong I like the name of this
brand pretty sure we've got in this
brand in boxycharm as well Neapolitan
palette I show up i shallow eyeshadow
palette this one is in the shade sweet
treat let's open it and see what it
looks like because I don't know what it
looks like ah these are really pretty
colors okay let's watch them the
pigmentation is actually pretty good on
these I mean I've definitely seen
eyeshadows with more pigment I'm not
gonna lie but I've seen eyeshadows are
far worse honestly though I'm not too
excited for this because I just I know
myself I'm not gonna grab this I'm not
gonna use this I'll probably pass this
along to annoy friends maybe somebody in
my life that doesn't have that many
eyeshadows and can benefit from this I
just know that I'm not gonna reach for
this okay and then that's a break tea oh
no I have something in here that was
kind of like bent a little bit well that
sucks
hopefully washing this will fix that I'm
so excited this makes the bag like 30
times better for me because I love Luxy
brushes especially these colors they
remind me of Cinderella for some strange
reason every time I don't have thee to
have the pink one and I love Luxy as a
brand this is a great brush that's
really amazing that we got it in the bag
this month because you pay like 10 bucks
for an Ipsy bag so that's awesome I'm
kind of glad I didn't cancel my Ipsy bag
this month but we'll see we'll play it
today's day or month to month I should
say this month was a hit for me I really
loved the brush I loved Moroccan oil
tart is a great brand I feel like they
had good products this month I don't
know at least in my bag leave me a
comment down below what you got in your
Ipsy bag this month what your favorite
product was like did we get similar
things I really want to know because I
really liked my bags and as always I
will leave everything that I got in my
bag down below with the price next to it
in case any of you guys were wondering
but that completes this video thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
in here of when if I should continue to
post videos kornelius have see ok so I
know not everybody likes screen eyeliner
but more often what I was gonna say
pigmented err that's not a word hey guys
so today's video is a makeup tutorial on
this look right here it's very simple
it's mainly focused on my skin there's
something about spring and summer that I
just love looking extra Dulli and extra
glowy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
