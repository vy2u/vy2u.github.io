where I feel like it is so incredibly
hot that I'm just uncomfortable and
everything that I wear I don't even want
to put my hair down or even put on a
t-shirt it is so hot in Florida like I
can't here take it in anyway that's not
what this video is about today is going
to be my olya unboxing for the month of
April a couple of weeks ago I posted my
first only unboxing ever and that was
actually for last month's and this one
is for the month of April my last video
where I did this I showed you guys the
25 dollar bag and the 35 dollar bag this
month I only have the $25 bag to show
you it was the one that I thought was
most worth it so when the box arrives to
your door this is what it looks like it
has a little card here that just gives
you little tips on how to make your
jewelry last longer and then it comes
with like a million of these little
paper paper things and then this is the
little bag that comes inside like I said
I absolutely love these bags these are
perfect to put your jewelry in when
you're traveling or just to store your
jewelry these are the cutest little
reusable bags I've ever seen I love them
so let's go ahead and open up this bag
shall we so the first thing in here is
this little necklace absolutely love
dainty jewelry it's my favorite and it's
actually really beautiful it's just this
really thin gold chain with like little
diamonds scattered all around it I think
it's really gorgeous and this necklace
would be perfect for layering like if
you had a shorter necklace and then
wanted to layer this one over it
layering and super in and I feel like
you could achieve that with this
necklace so I'm really really happy
about this it's beautiful the next thing
in the bag is super super fun and pretty
it is this beautiful bracelet right here
let's see if it actually fits me cuz
bracelets never do so it's a little bit
big on me but I could definitely wear it
with my watch let me sit let me go grab
that so this is how it looks with my
watch this is actually perfect for me
because
since my wrists are so like incredibly
small like an annoying small where
bracelets don't fit me ever it's really
frustrating so I never wear bracelets
but this isn't actually too big to wear
I can't wear with my watch so that's
awesome
but it's just this really really
beautiful bracelet that has like these
gold giant triangle studs right here and
then this really beautiful colorful
pattern that just links them all
together I absolutely love this it is so
gorgeous this is perfect for spring and
summer I feel and it does not feel cheap
it feels pretty heavy and like it is
pretty good quality so I'm actually
really excited about this I'm definitely
gonna get a lot of use out of it and
then the last thing are these earrings
right here they're actually really
really pretty they're not typically my
style but I do see myself wearing them
with like my hair down nice and curly I
feel like it would give like a nice
little bohemian vibe to it but even
though I don't normally reach for
earrings like these these are actually
really pretty they look like little
teardrops I think they're actually
pretty cute so that is the last thing in
the bag so if you don't know what the
olia box is it is a monthly subscription
service where they send you jewelry to
your home and they're all trendy pieces
things that are in style right now so if
you're someone who doesn't like to go
shopping for jewelry then this is
perfect for you because you are always
getting on trend pieces directly to your
door the $25 subscription comes with two
to three Gorge pieces and the $35
subscription comes with three to four
jewelry pieces so it's up to you my
favorite is the $25 one personally I
just think you get more bang for your
buck and I actually really really like
the twenty five dollar subscription I do
think it's worth it so I hope you
enjoyed this video like I said I want to
do other things on my channel besides
makeup like I want to branch into like
fashion and stuff like that because I
want some more diversity to do at my age
so I hope you like videos like this
thank you so much for watching guys
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
worms are everywhere
what's up so the first thing in here is
tangled I'm digging this necklace as a
headpiece though I'm not gonna lie and
then this really really cutter cutter
then this is perfect view it's just
perfect for you because you're always
risk why can't I speak today like okay
let's try this one more time
very nice and just tells you how to keep
your jewelry nice and clean no you can
use to prolong
oh god that just went everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
