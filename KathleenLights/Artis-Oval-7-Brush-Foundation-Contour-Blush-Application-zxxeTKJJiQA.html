okay so all my clothes is in the washer
so I'm wearing a beat-up v-neck that I
don't even think is mine I don't think
this is my shirt my hair is a friggin
mess and my eyebrows are bushy er than
ever
I'm done my eyebrows and what feels like
an eternity so they are so wonky if you
saw them up close you would think by the
way if you guys live in the Miami Lakes
area the dragonfly spa is where I get my
eyebrows done and she's a genius and
she's amazing at eyebrows so if you're
in the Miami Lakes area that's a great
place to go to okay so this video is a
first impressions I decided to just pull
up get my hair out of my face because we
will be using this guy to apply my
foundation okay so today's first
impression is on this brush right here
this is from the brand artis and I have
been seeing these brushes a lot recently
so I decided to buy one to see if it was
good and I wanted one for my foundation
honestly um they make eye brushes like
this as well but I don't see how that
would work for me
like eye brushes in this style I don't
know but anyway these are the artiste
elite collection mirror finish brushes
they have a ton of them but I bought the
Oval seven brush and I got this one
specifically for my foundation the ole 7
is specifically good for contouring and
applying blush which is weird because I
mean I bought it for my foundation but I
am gonna try to contour and put my blush
on with this brush as well it says it's
made with cosmic fiber cosmic azam Cosme
fiber animal-free Beauty cause my fiber
you don't know what that is so this is
what the brush looks like I've never
used this is what it looks like when I
posted this brush on Instagram I would
say 50% of the people said it looked
like a spoon cuz it was like this and
then a lot of people said it looked like
a toothbrush supposedly the story around
these brushes is that they are meant for
applying makeup to yourself like this
you know like you do it for your own
face as opposed to regular makeup brush
that were kind of made to use on other
people like as makeup artists putting
makeup on other people so that's really
interesting and this feels incredibly
soft actually when I got this package I
was at my dad's house and Danny was
there and he was like um this isn't as
soft as like an it cosmetics brush I'm
like you know too much but he's right it
does feel a little bit stiffer but only
because it's like different I feel like
it's shorter it's a little bit more
dense but it is really soft I mean my
dad said it was incredibly soft so I
think it's soft I can't win my air it's
driving me nuts
okay so let's get the party started I
have already primed my face and I'm
gonna go in with my foundation I'm gonna
use the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick
because this is a foundation I typically
use with a brush instead of a Beauty
Blender so I wanted to see how this
brush would work and according to a lot
of people this doesn't suck up your
foundation like a lot of people say that
you get a more folder coverage because
this doesn't really suck up your
foundation as opposed to other brushes
I'm just going to go ahead and apply
this like I normally would which I like
to swipe it this is a little bit dark
for me at the moment but
we shall work with the bishop
you're not supposed to Pat this in or
buff it in like you're just supposed to
swipe this on your face
I feel like I need to get closer to the
top like hold it like this oh yeah I
like this better like this
I don't really notice anything different
to be honest then when I use a like flat
top or a buffing brush from like Real
Techniques okay so my foundation is
completely on and it did apply my
foundation really really nicely I don't
see a huge difference compared to like
my morphe like flat top kabuki I don't
really see much difference except I do
see that this kind of gives me a little
bit of a fuller coverage in my monthly
favorites video I said that for me this
was a like medium coverage foundation
but in combination with this brush I
feel like I got a pretty full coverage
so that is a good thing because it
didn't really soak up much product this
is incredibly dense and I could just
tell on the brush that only a little bit
of foundation is like in the bristles
that's for right now that is the only
difference
I can tell with this brush and this is a
very pricy brush let me see how much I
pay for it okay so I paid $55 for this
brush why did I have the feeling that I
paid 40 no I paid 55 that's a spent so
as of right now is it worth it for me
just for the simple fact that product
doesn't soak up I don't know I'm not
sure but this is so pricy and like my
Real Techniques buffing brush is like
ten dollars so I'm going to go ahead and
finish the rest of my makeup and I'm
gonna try to contour and add a blush
with this brush because on the box that
says that this brush is actually really
good for that but I'm going to go ahead
and put on some concealer this is
actually the first time I use this
concealer this is from H&amp;amp;M beauty and it
is their cover up concealer so I guess
it's like another first impressions this
in the shade vanilla and I'm just gonna
pop this underneath oh this is like
extremely yellow usually not kind of
color go for underneath my eyes but
we're gonna go with it
why is it that my first impressions
never go as smoothly as I want them to
I'm gonna use my pure mineral sponge
that I did not wet
oh this video is going fabulous
hey good job H&amp;amp;M by the way I will be
doing a kind of like a one brand
tutorial using H&amp;amp;M products kind of like
a one brand story oh because I have not
found the foundation but I did find a BB
cream so I'm gonna use like the BB cream
so that is that video should be coming
up soon let me see if this thing you
know what No wow I really like this H&amp;amp;M
concealer I know this video is not about
it but it has like a nice fresh finish
and I don't know I really like it
hopefully it doesn't really crease so
bad but let me go ahead and set that
just gonna set my concealer using Mac's
emphasise powder right here this is a
pure blurring a powder brush and I'm
just gonna set that okay now I'm going
to contour my cheekbones
wish me luck I'm gonna clean this off on
a towel I have here on my lap because it
does have foundation on it so maybe this
isn't the best thing to do but you know
what
wouldn't be a Kathleen video without a
few disasters I'm gonna take this duo
again by the way I bought this on mac
cosmetics calm and it is their bone
beige and emphasize duo so I'm gonna
take kind of like the edge of this brush
like this see if this would be a good
way to contour and I'm going to dip it
into bone beige and see
works ah
like how would I do this
hey not too bad that contoured really
nicely so okay I'm left-handed so this
might be like we're good
maybe I'm not contouring the way that
you're supposed to contour with these
brushes but I'm just winging it and
seems to be working really nicely this
would probably be a really good brush or
like a harsh contour like if you want a
really strong chiseled cheek bone this
brush would be good something for
everyday natural look maybe not so much
the good thing about this brush is that
you saw like I created a super harsh
line when I first put this powder down
but it blends the product really really
nicely like I was able to diffuse that
super harsh contour which I really like
okay so I am pleasantly impressed by the
way this contoured my cheekbones wow I
didn't think I was gonna like it okay so
I'm cleaning it off on my towel again
and I'm going to apply my blush and
today I'm going to be using kind of like
a soft blush this is benefits rocket or
blush and side note I got this like in a
set this came like in a cool set where I
had a bunch of benefit blushes and hoola
but I feel like the quality is different
on the sets then they are when you buy
the actual product like the full size
box powder blush I don't know I feel
like they aren't as pigmented in these
little sets am I the only one who feels
that way I want to take benefits rock
Azur
and I am just going to stamp this in
here I suppose pop it off and apply I'm
scared should I do it like this should I
do it like this I don't know I don't
know
Wow hey I'm pretty impressed and I say
that because I used this blush yesterday
unlike a fluffy blush brush and I found
that like barely any pigmentation was
coming off but with this brush it's
making it look a lot more pigmented okay
so that is my blush on I'm so impressed
by the way that this applied the blush
but I will say if you only blush that is
extremely pigmented I wouldn't use this
I would use something like I don't know
a duo fiber brush or any other brush
because this applies your blush very
very pigmented ly pigmented ly hope
that's word because I was just telling
you guys right before I use this that
this didn't really have that much
pigmentation and uh yesa dues
yessuh dues with this broom I would use
this for my highlight as well but on the
box that doesn't really say that it is
for that I'm just gonna apply my
anastasia beverly hills starlight
highlighting powder starlight
illuminator with my sigma high cheekbone
highlighter i used to not be a big fan
of Sigma brushes because they would shed
on me a lot and their new collection is
actually really really good I don't know
if they've just upped their game I'm not
sure I'm not a Sigma affiliate or
anything like that
okay and then I'm just going to apply
mascara on my lower lash line and my
lipstick and I'm going to use my benefit
roller lash and the Oprah long-lasting
liquid lipstick and Angeles and I will
be right back to tell you my final
thoughts okay guys so I'm quickly going
to give you like an overview of what I
think of this brush to be completely
honest when I first like applied my
foundation I was like okay it doesn't
suck up foundation that's it this is not
worth fifty five dollars that's
ridiculous but I actually really really
really like this brush I feel like it's
a one-stop shop I put on my foundation
perfectly fine it blended really nicely
it didn't soak up product it did a
really good job and then it gave me a
really nice contoured look it wasn't
muddy or anything and all I did was just
like wipe off the excess foundation on a
towel and I went in with the contour and
applied it really nicely this blends out
product beautifully when I first applied
that line I was like holy moly but it
blended it out perfectly and then
yesterday I used the rocket or blush
that came in this little set and I
wasn't crazy in love with it because I
found that there was barely any
pigmentation and then I applied it with
this brush and you could totally see my
blush I mean I like a very soft
application of blush regardless I don't
have too much blush on right now but you
could definitely see it and yesterday I
really couldn't and not to mention it
just blended out the blush really nicely
I had no problem blending anything out
with this brush I could probably even
highlight with this let me add some Oh
really really love this brush because it
can do so much you can put on your
foundation you can contour you can put
on your blush you can even put on your
highlight I didn't want to use it for my
concealer because I like to Pat my
concealer in and this is something that
you should like swipe with so that is
the only thing really that I don't see
myself using with this brush but this
can do so many things with that being
said it is a pricy product but I do see
myself using it often and I don't regret
it so I don't know I guess you can make
your own judgement so I do give this
brush a big thumbs up I just wish it was
more affordable
I think 55 dollars for our brush is
ridiculous
so yeah that completes his first
impressions side note I really like this
H&amp;amp;M concealer and it's like eight
dollars I really like it so I guess that
completes this video I hope you guys
enjoyed this first impressions and that
it wasn't really boring and weird I feel
like my first impressions don't make
sense I'm all over the place that's why
I hardly ever knew of them so yeah that
completes this video thank you guys so
much for watching it please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
