my monthly if see bag unboxing I do
these every month excuse my hair I was
actually just watching Desi's video I'm
sure you guys know she is she's perfect
and she did like a tutorial on a hair
like this and I was like oh I want to do
it so I was like following along to a
tutorial the mine looks terrible but
whatever we got to work with what we've
got because I'm on tight schedule so
yeah let's just get right on in huh I
got taped stuck to my nail okay so this
is what the bag looked mine's a little
squished there you this what the bag
looks like this month it's really really
cute it reminds me a lot of a bag we got
a few months ago that was like
see-through and pink I really like these
types of bags because you can use these
in school for like pencil holders like
you can just take your pens and pencils
and erasers and stuff like that and put
them in this bag and and take them to
school I think that's a really good idea
for this bag so yeah just a suggestion
in case you guys wanted to know what to
do with that bag so this is the card you
already know and I actually have
something else in this bag and it is the
Urban Decay perversion bigger blacker
better this is their mascara that they
came out with I'm pretty sure term
indicates just came out with this so
they give us a sample of the mascara and
I've actually been really excited to try
this and this is the sample size and I'm
excited to try them see the wand ooh
my kind of wand my kind of wand the
full-sized version of this perversion
mascara retails for $22 which is pretty
that's what I figured from Urban Decay
so if it's good
then yeah you want to see how this looks
on my lashes then stay tuned till the
end okay so now moving on to the actual
bag the first thing I see is this little
sample of mana kadar I'm not very good
at pronouncing things but it is a sheer
glow shimmer lotion I'm guessing this is
kind of like a highlight or like just an
iridescent lotion let me read this an
incandescent liquid that lights up the
skin with all-over radiance mixed with
foundation or wear alone okay so this
kind of works like an illuminating cream
that you can mix with your foundation or
put it on the high points of your cheeks
or just put it all over your face and
then apply foundation I really like
products like this this is a strange
color usually these kind of like
illuminating lotions are kind of like a
champagne color this is just like
straight-up pink doesn't look super
super iridescent can you tell can you
see oh do you see like the pink when you
mix it in it kind of I don't know it
doesn't really show up all that much but
I guess I'll see how it applies so this
is obviously not a full-size product but
the full-size retails for $29
mmm that's expensive so I mean does a
bit of work so the next thing in my bag
is this little quad type of thing from
Coastal Scents it has four different
eyeshadows it has a white one a purple
one a green one and a pink dusty mauve
color
I think Coastal Scents eyeshadows are
really really good especially for the
price so it's kind of neat that we get
these things I can't really find the
price on the Coastal Scents website so
I'm not exactly sure how much this cost
it is a sample it says so I'm not sure
but I think everybody got different
colors in their bag this is just the one
that I got so okay so the next thing is
this little chapstick and it is
Jersey Shore Sun mongongo nutrient
anti-aging lip conditioner nice I really
love anti-aging products even chapstick
because you know you want your lips to
look nice all the time and yeah I don't
think you could ever have too many
chopsticks this is obviously a
full-sized product and it retails for
five dollars and fifty cents
it's organic cruelty free let me smell
is oh it smells like lemons I like how
it smells and then the last thing in my
bag is this body cream with volcanic
minerals and Sicilian lemons this is by
the brand called Cali I think yeah Cali
cosmetics this does smell a little bit
like like lentil a lot of it like lemons
I definitely smell the lemons in this
and it feels really really nice on the
skin yeah I definitely see myself using
this because it is small enough to where
its travel friendly you could just throw
this in your purse and moisturize your
hands or your body when you're on the go
um small little creams like this are
always good to have you know for a
person stuff so that's nice this
obviously is it's a full-size product
and the full-size retails for thirty-six
dollars so that's good that's cool that
sounds intriguing volcanic minerals and
Sicilian lemons I'm intrigued
okay guys so that was everything I got
in my Ipsy bag this month um it was a
good bag it was it was good I think that
the standout product in this bag was the
Urban Decay perversion mascara even
though it is a sample size I love sample
mascara and I feel like you use it more
than a full size you know typically
you're supposed to throw out a mascara
every three months and sometimes I feel
like in three months I don't use up the
entire mascara but I feel like I use the
entire mascara of this tube do you
understand what I'm saying so hopefully
I like it yeah it was a decent bag it
was good for ten dollars a month I
really can't complain I love the bag
itself so yeah it was good if you want
to see some of these products in action
then stay tuned okay so I'm going to try
out this little man
sheer glow shimmer lotion I already know
it's not going to work for my cheekbones
because there wasn't much iridescent
happening there I have a feeling it's
I'm really going to like this to apply
under my foundation because it left my
hand super smooth I just have to take my
little morphe brush and stipple it onto
my cheekbones and pray for the best Oh
I mean I had a pretty shimmery blush on
to begin with but can you see the
difference actually it kind of breaks up
the foundation underneath at least on
with this foundation that I'm wearing
it's kind of breaking up the foundation
I don't know I like it I'm going to use
it personally kind of like a primer I
think that's what I will use that for
I'm going to take off my mascara really
quick I just have a light layer on my
top lashes okay so I'm going to try out
the perversion mascara not going to curl
my lashes or anything I want to see if
it holds a curl if it creates a curl out
also
okay so this is too small coats of the
mascara and then one coat on my bottom
lashes I really liked this on my bottom
lashes specifically because if you can
see the wand is not well it looks on
camera for some reason but the wand is
not too big to where I can't coat my
lashes so I really really like it for my
bottom lashes as for my top lashes it
was nice it gave some volume not too
much not like crazy volume and it gave
some decent length it's a pretty decent
mascara not my favorite but keep in mind
it is a little bit of a drier formula
for people who don't like that you might
not like this but I like it I will
definitely use it and I don't know if I
would purchase it though I'm still I got
to test the waters a little more I am
such a doofus I probably should have
tested this out before putting on
mascara I'm just going to try on with
the the lip balm
oh it's super that's coming off on my
lips it is super lemony feels really
nice and smooth if you don't like lemons
you're going to hate this it's like
lemon eh okay so as for these shadows
I'm not going to really do an eye look
with it right now I just want to test
out the pigmentation I'm going to take
the white eye shadow and use it as a
brow bone color just to see how it is
oh is nice
by the way that white eyeshadow was
called polar bear I'm going to take this
pinky shade called mauve and I'm just
going to dust this into my career I was
creased by the way
these eyeshadows are really pigmented in
my opinion and they go on really smooth
then I'm just going to take this purple
and smudge it okay so I just put it on
really sloppily but these eyeshadows get
an a-plus for me great pigmentation love
them definitely going to be using them
more often okay so that completes my
Ipsy bag unboxing I hope you enjoyed
