like I haven't filmed the video in so
long when it's only been a week which
doesn't seem like a long time to certain
people but I post my videos three times
a week every Monday Wednesday and Friday
at least I've been doing that for the
longest time and if you keep up with my
videos you know that I did not post not
one video last week which is really rare
for me so really quickly I want to tell
you why if you even care which you
probably don't you probably didn't even
notice that I was in posting videos
probably no one cares but Danny's mom
and grandmother came up from Miami last
week to visit they were here from
Saturday up until yesterday which was
Sunday and we have a two-bedroom
apartment we have our bedroom where we
sleep and obviously and then we have
this room which is half Danny's office
and half my this area my Beauty area and
the room isn't very big to begin with
but when they came to visit they
obviously stayed in this room because
when we have visitors this turns into
like the guest bedroom so they stayed in
this room and there was stuff everywhere
you know like clothes and just things
that they brought so I could not film at
all like there was stuff all over my
desk I couldn't film even if I wanted to
this room was so hectic and just full of
stuff and plus I really wanted to you
know spend time with them we don't see
them very often so they came up to visit
and I didn't want to like ignore them to
film you know I wanted to spend time
with the family
as much as I could but they left
yesterday and since today is Monday it
is time to get back into my three videos
a week routine that I've been doing
anyway enough with story time obviously
you know that this is my monthly
favorites video since that's what it's
titled so I just want to go ahead and
get into the things that I have been
loving this month so the first thing I
want to talk about I was a little
skeptical about it when I first got it
and it is the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer
I have the color warm tan this is the
lighter one the other one that they have
is darker I don't know what that one's
called but this is the lighter one and
it looks pretty damn dark in the pan I
don't know to me it looks really dark
and it doesn't come off that dark on
your skin which is what I like it's
actually a really really natural color
when you first watch it on your hand it
seems a little orange but it doesn't see
it looks a little orange but it doesn't
show up like that on my skin when I put
it on my face and it blends out really
really well
it comes with a little mirror by the way
which is kind of cool but yeah I was
skeptical about this at first because I
thought that it was gonna feel like
brown grease that sounds really bad okay
no no brown grease but I thought that I
was gonna be really tacky and sticky so
that's why I was a little hesitant to
try it but a lot of people liked it so I
picked it up and I really loved it I
like applying it with the Real
Techniques buffing brush this honestly
buffs it into your skin beautifully and
I really like it because it's not super
dewy but it's not like a super matte
bronzer either it's pretty matte for the
most part it doesn't have any shimmers
or glitters in it but it just kind of
gives you
a little bit of a glow overall which I
really like and the texture of this is
actually pretty strange because once you
swirl your fingers in it it's obviously
a cream but once you do this like when
you feel it in between your fingers it
almost turns into a powder like it feels
a little powdery in my hands not thicker
creamy at all which I love so I actually
really have been liking this okay so
recently I've been buying a lot of nail
polish and I realized that it's all from
the same brand I have just been crazy
about the Sally Hansen
extreme where nail polishes recently
they are amazing they're just really
opaque just like one swipe on your nail
and they don't chip very easily which is
what I love about them and they are
extremely affordable I believe they're
$2.99 at Target or Walgreens or whatever
I don't think it's $2.99 yeah they're
super super cheap like I said I've just
been loving all the colors but the one
that I am crazy about recently is this
one right here and it is perfect pairing
it doesn't seem that special or unique
in the bottle but when you put it on
your nails it kind of turns into like a
different green I feel it's just so
unique I don't have any color that looks
like this and in the Sun my nails glow
like they glow I got compliments and a
bunch of times when I was wearing this
the other day I just loved it I wore in
my highlight and contouring video that's
the nail polish I'm wearing in that
video so yeah Sally Hansen extreme wear
nail polishes are my obsession right now
okay so I have found a liquid liner that
I love just as much as my Maybelline
master precise which is really rare
because this is like Holy Grail status
for me and I found something that's just
as good or at or that I like just as
good and it is the Jordana fabula inner
you can find the brand Jordana at
Walgreens from what I know that's the
only place that sells Jordana but I was
looking at the new Jordana stuff and
they came out with a bunch of new things
this is old but I was looking at all the
new Jordana makeup and I saw this and I
decided to give it a try because it is a
dollar ninety-nine
or greens and I was running low on my
master precise and I freaking love this
it is the liner I'm wearing on my eyes
right now which I'm sure you can't tell
but it's such a good it's good stuff I
got it in the color black and when they
say black they ain't kiddin
it is so pigmented it's like the
blackest black liquid eyeliner ever and
it's just awesome when I first opened it
I was a little worried because the tip
on this is a little bit fatter than I'm
used to the Maybelline master precise if
you know is like super super thin it's a
very long felt tip and it comes to a
very thin point and this doesn't this is
more of a marker type of tip but it
creates really really thin black lines I
actually feel like I get just as thin of
an application with this as I do with
the master precise like it makes the
thinnest black line in the world so the
tip actually doesn't bother me and the
fact that it's shorter kind of helps me
be a little bit more precise than the
other one does because the other one has
a little bit of a longer felt tip I just
really love this I think it's just as
good as my Maybelline one and it's a lot
cheaper not a lot cheaper but it's a
dollar ninety-nine I think this is about
seven or eight dollars so I mean you
save some money and it's a great liquid
liner definitely check it out if you
haven't already okay so recently I have
been all about pigments they have been
my obsession and I have just been so
impressed with the Maybelline Color
tattoo pure pigments so impressed I
first picked up one of them loved it so
much that I went and I got two more the
first color I have is this one it's
called never fade Jade this is the first
one I bought it is such a rich turquoise
color and it goes on extremely pigmented
with just one swipe like it is a pure
pigment literally it's so intense and
bold I love it this next one is called
barely brazen it's a very neutral color
like a very creamy color but it has an
intense Sheen to it which makes for a
beautiful
highlight I'm actually wearing it as a
highlight on my face right now and down
the center of my nose on my cheekbones
and I have it in my tear duct right now
and as my highlight underneath my brow
bone it's a beautiful multi-purpose
pigment beautiful on your lid and as a
highlight on your face this one is
called breaking bronze and I think it's
my favorite one out of three that I own
just because I love bronze colors and
warm tones and the fact that this is so
rich and pigmented and goes on
beautifully just with one swipe I'm just
obsessed I cannot get enough of this
color it's amazing and I don't even use
fix+
when I use these which I usually do with
my pigments are you always use fix+
but I haven't yet and it and the
pigmentation is there I haven't used to
fix+ yeah and I love how it looks alone
so I imagine with fix+ what this will
look like probably like straight metal
or something it's just amazing really
quickly though I have to give a shout
out to probably my favorite pigment of
all time and it is max pigment in the
color tan this makes brown eyes pop
green eyes pop blue eyes pop any eye
color will just look so intense and
beautiful when you wear this I actually
have a tutorial where I use this pigment
I will link that down below if you're
interested it's a beautiful bronze color
but it has some pink to it like it looks
very rose gold on your eyes which rose
gold is probably one of the most
beautiful colors ever so this pigment is
just amazing so the next product is
something that I actually rediscovered
in my makeup collection and it is the
Mac I call and coaster reach coaster
Ritchie coaster but it is a beautiful
brown eyeliner because it has really
intense red undertones when you put on
your waterline you definitely see the
red in the brown which seems a little
bit scary but it just makes green eyes
really pop and it just brings out the
green in your eyes so if you have a
hazel eyes I think you would really like
this too because it just makes the green
come out a lot and it's a rediscovered
item because I wore the
i aligner literally every single day in
high school like my senior year I wore
this every single day I bought this
multiple times actually have a beat-up
one right here so I just bought a new
one this one's a little beat-up this is
probably one of my favorite eyeliners of
all time it's just so unique I used it
in a recent get ready with me video it
was like a red brown smokey eye and I
was like ah now I remember why I loved
you so much so I've just been obsessed
with this all over again
hey now moving on to my favorite
category in the makeup world and that is
lip products and I wouldn't be Kathleen
if I didn't mention at least one lip
product in my favorites video which I'm
not mentioning just one I have a bunch
to talk about but you know I have to
give a huge shout out to this lipstick
because it has been my life for the past
couple of weeks
it is Revlon's Super Lustrous lipstick
and stormy pink this is the matte
formula and honestly I have worn this
lipstick every day for the past couple
of weeks I wear it every day to work
which it's like why are you wearing your
bright pink lipstick to work but that's
the thing this could either be a very
intense bright bold pink or it can be
very muted and toned down because it's
not very pigmented when you first swipe
it on your lips which a lot of people
might not like but I really love that
about this it goes on very soft when you
first apply it and then it could build
you can build it up to a very intense
bold pink color it's what I have on my
lips right now it's beautiful what I
love so much about this lipstick is the
formula it's a matte lipstick but I
swear it is like the softest matte
lipstick I own out of every matte
lipstick I own this one feels the best
it feels like butter on your lips it's
oh my god I can't get enough of this
lipstick I'm probably gonna go through
this very quickly it's just it's my life
right now
so you guys know how much I hate lip
gloss I just hate the texture of them I
don't like lip gloss but I have been
really loving these almay lick
lip balms they're called liquid lip
balms because they're supposed to feel
like a bomb you know like a chapstick
where it's not sticky or anything like
that and it's they are completely right
there is no stickiness to these guys
whatsoever I'm so impressed I have this
one right here this one's called
nutrients and I would swatch this one
for you but honestly it comes out clear
this is so incredibly sheer that there
is no color to this but I still really
love this because I like pairing this on
top of like matte lipsticks to give them
more of a gloss or just on top of any
lip gloss that feels a little bit
lipstick that feels a little bit drying
when I want it to be a little bit more
you know glossy and shiny give my
lipstick more life I have plucked this
guy on top and it just brings shine to
my lip so I don't mind that there's no
color to this these other two I really
love this one is called rosy lipped and
this one is called blooming these are
also pretty sheer but there is some
color to them I will say that if you're
someone looking for a very very old pink
lip gloss then check out the darker
colors in the collection I know that the
darker the colors get the more opaque
they get like the darker ones have a lot
of color to them and the lighter ones
are a little bit more sheer which is
actually what I like about them rosy lip
is just a very classy nude like that's
what I think of when I think of it it's
just a very classic nude and I think
it's a really pretty lip gloss for fall
and then blooming is just your typical
baby pink color beautiful on top of
other pink lipsticks it's just a really
pretty everyday lip gloss to just slap
on the smell on these guys is so
delicious like you literally want to eat
your lip so when you put this on the
smell is amazing the texture is amazing
I am really impressed with these Alma
liquid lip balms definitely check them
out they're awesome okay lastly when it
comes to lipsticks I have to mention
these these are the Milani color
statement lipsticks and they
have become my favorite lipstick at the
drugstore of all time these are the best
drugstore lipsticks I have ever come
across
they smell like Darlie rancher
watermelons like watermelon Jolly
Ranchers
I have very chapped lips like my lips
are usually always chapped and when I
put these lipsticks on they're so creamy
and they just feel so nice that my lips
don't even look chapped when I have
these on which is pretty rare they come
in all sorts of colors I have nothing
negative to say about these things
they're creamy they smell fantastic they
glide on smooth they're just amazing
I have nude cream which is just your
basic Beijing nude color I think that
this would look beautiful on different
skin tones I have this one right here
called sweet nectar which is definitely
for the bolder girl it's a very neon
orange perfect for summer and I have
this one right here called rose hip
which I think would be a favorite
amongst a lot of people it's just a very
hot pink it definitely packs a punch
it's really intense and then I have this
one right here cause uptown mauve which
I bought it for the upcoming fall months
this is like the perfect
pinky fuchsia purple color it's gonna be
perfect for the Fall and it just it
looks so beautiful on I swear these
aren't the best lipsticks at the
drugstore they're amazing okay so that's
it these are all the beauty products I
have been loving the month of August
definitely check out any of the things
I've mentioned they're all pretty
affordable I think everything except two
things were from the drugstore this
month I have just been loving them thank
you so much for watching guys please

will see you in my next video
