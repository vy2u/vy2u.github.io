my back to hear your mom Betsy and this
month is black and I like it I really
like the black box a lot of you guys
were telling me last month that yours
your box was black and now - I like this
I wonder if they're keeping them black
like this cuz I think it looks like
sleek and nice well you know the drill
let's just hop on into this bad boy
every time I try to open this box I
almost break a nail
okay so this is what the box looks like
this is the cod and it says gorgeous
globetrotter okay so the theme is like
traveling you know okay so uh it's just
a little card that says why you use
sunscreen and hair products it's just
information on something that's in this
box of course so this is the book and of
course this is like the biggest thing in
the box so I'm gonna grab this first
okay this little card is like directions
on this this is the noose shield I'm
probably pronouncing that wrong but in
conditioner natural shine with Moroccan
and argan oil SPF 15 for scalp your
scalp first control sunburn shield oh
how cool hair color and texture
protection wow that's really really cool
I'm not gonna lie okay I burned my scalp
a lot in the Sun I don't think of it
like we go out in the Sun and we don't
think about protecting our scalp cuz
honestly I don't even know how to do
that but I always get sunburned on my
scalp I don't know I thought I was the
only one but I guess not
this is like a leave-in conditioner that
you put on your scalp and it shields
from the Sun if that's not amazing I
don't know it might be only one
completely amazed by this year-round
color and texture protection for healthy
hair non-greasy light hold SPF 15 for
your scalp infuse with argan oil vitamin
E vitamin b5 does not contain synthetic
dyes sulfates parabens this is awesome I
hope Oh
oh it smells delicious
oh that smells really really amazing
okay I'm gonna see how I can work I can
use this do you just like massage it in
your head okay there's a how-to on this
card what's really great about boxycharm
is that they not only list the products
on this card and tell you the price but
they also like kind of teach you how to
use them actually yes they they teach
you how to use every product and I
really appreciate that so it says apply
to and work into wet or dry hair and
then just brush out for color protection
applied to your entire hair for scalp
protection just work into your scalp I
like to go to the pool and just pick up
my hair like just like this but then put
a braid so that it doesn't get tangled
in the pool
so this is awesome - just like pump into
my hands massage in my scalp and then
pick up my hair and put it into a braid
okay yes I'm gonna be using this and I
will update y'all because I really I
love this already - have any muse it
okay next product in here is this little
pink box this is so susan skincare color
performance statement skin highlighting
crayons silent silent it's in the shade
starlight mineral oils no faff let Sates
that word I don't know how to say no
parabens organic chia seed extract to
help moisturize the skin silk peptides
to promote supplements hypoallergenic
and non comedogenic the way this is
full-sized I mean of course as you can
tell I didn't even tell you the price
this is full-size and this retails for
$26 alright already
we already have more in this product
than you paid for the box because the
box is swing one this is 26 and we just
got started okay so oh my gosh this is a
highlight this is like a Koran highlight
oh my gosh okay so I could totally see
this not suiting every skin tone in this
box it's a very Paroli highlight I don't
know if you can tell right yeah look
it's super pearly which is actually the
kind of highlights I love but this would
be nice to put just like in your inner
corners or on the tops of the cheekbones
if you don't have really dark skin it's
a twist up kind of product and it looks
like
little lipstick I think it's really cool
that they added a highlighting product
since highlighting is all the rage right
now so this is a full-size product and
this retails for $20 the next thing I
see in the box is this little guy right
here this says mica beauty cosmetics and
this is their gel eyeliner in the shade
black this full-size and this is 35
bucks
damned SSS eyeliner I'm used to buying
honestly I'm not gonna lie I'm used to
my Maybelline gel liner or my makeup
geek one I really love the morphe when
it's awesome - and those are so
inexpensive so $35 desta sensitive I
don't spend that much on the eyeliner
but it's nice when I get in a box you
know so even though this is pricey it's
kind of nice that they put a pricey item
in the box and you only pay $21 but this
is a very very black eyeliner so I hope
it stays on my eyes and it doesn't
smudge so yes I will be testing that out
um oh ok so they also have this in the
box this is from the brand Sita
Sarah this is an eyeliner brush clever
boxycharm
very clever it's one of those typical um
just eyeliner brushes it has a nice
skinny little brush that's awesome that
they included a brush to throw in with
the eyeliner so this thing is stuck too
this is full size of course the brush
Muslim it's full size what I don't think
and it's sixteen dollars okay and then
the last thing I'm really really excited
about I know a lot of you guys were so
excited when you guys found out this was
going to be in the box this month I got
a lot of comments about it and it is the
revealed 3 palette from Coastal Scents
they boxycharm has given out the
revealed one and two so I guess it only
makes sense that they throw in the
revealed 3 as well I can't open this and
I don't want to use motif cuz I'm not a
Neanderthal
so this one is definitely a lot more
plummy and perfe purpley than the other
ones I think the revealed one resembled
more of the naked one and two um or
something like that this one definitely
has more varied tone shades and coal so
Scents revealed palettes are not my
all-time favorite palette but I think
for the money you do get a lot of
eyeshadows and if you use them wet they
could be really really nice and intense
so I think they're good for the price
this this is my god I keep dropping
everything this is full size and this is
supposed to be 39.95 like on the Coastal
Scents website it says 39.95
but it's always on sale for $20 so it's
$20 yeah that is everything I got in my
box this month these videos always go by
so quickly I feel like I'm sitting here
for like five minutes only I'm really
really really excited about this I don't
know but I got really excited overall
value of the box this month was over a
hundred and seventeen dollars let's say
this is probably the best video box up
there right now so yeah let me know if
you liked your boxycharm this month what
you liked the least and what you liked
the most
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
