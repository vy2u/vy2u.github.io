my back zoom but they change the logo it
used to say like boxycharm longer need
to find like a specific tool like my
boxycharm box opener I need to create
one cuz it's dangerous with these
brushes so this is what the box looks
like this month's theme is express
yourself and it's like a 90s emoji theme
if you follow boxycharm on instagram
that survived they're giving it is
hottest bolas in here I don't know why
my eyes are bleeding from the heat you
know what's been happening to me my skin
has been breaking out for like the past
three weeks and it's not like breakouts
like pimples or anything it's just so
much texture I have so much texture all
over my face all over my face and I am
not doing anything different I'm not
using anything different the only thing
that I've changed is my diet but I've
been eating way better like I mean
eating a lot cleaner way more fruits way
more vegetables I don't know what's
happening to my face is this like a
detox is my face doing like a three
weeks detox because I'm eating very
healthy like is that a thing I don't
think so because I hear you break out
when you eat bad and I haven't been any
better so what is happening face anyway
I know no one cares let's go in to this
box I'm gonna grab this thing because
it's like sitting right there and these
worms are covering everything else this
is from a brand called
aloe pure and it is their time Repair
Serum
powerful age defying skincare complex
with alpha and beta hydroxy acids to
smooth away dead skin cells and powerful
antioxidants to protect skin from
damaging free radicals so it is a face
serum for some reason this month on the
card they didn't right next to it if
it's full-size or not they always write
up its full size but by the looks of
this I'm gonna say this is full size of
course and this retails for $48 you know
what I'm just gonna that's gonna make a
mess I'll just move it over okay let's
see what this is
this from a brand called dirty little
secret oh it says velvet matte liquid
lipstick oh I love liquid lipstick let's
see what color this is
Oh
oh my gosh totally Minnie Mouse vibes
what that's so cute
I don't like the name of links it's a
really pretty bright red liquid lipstick
I hope it has a nice formula this is the
shade of phantom oh my gosh
I love this color these are my favorite
kinds of Reds to wear like the really
bright almost like borderline orange did
I spit that's not Orange that's
definitely red but you know what I mean
I prefer Reds like this I love them
especially this time of year I'm gonna
let that sit there I wanna see how it
dries but this is a full-size product of
course in this retails for ten dollars
so it's actually pretty uh pretty
affordable liquid lipstick I'm excited
to see how that formula is okay next up
in the books we got this they're all in
like little black boxes I just realized
this is by the brand Beauty for real I
definitely used this brand before and
this is their shadow stick one of those
um Laura Mercier caviar sticks a bunch
of brands do something similar to this
like as you weigh oh this is a very
glittery Oh actually it's not that
glittery
this would look really pretty just like
blended on the entire lid this still
hasn't completely dried yet oh my gosh
another little black box though they do
die on purpose this is from the brand I
want to say deuce a deuce deuce Doce oh
my god I don't Mac slash volumizer
mascara
I love mascara I love trying new
mascaras that looks like a nice one I
could kind of tell more or less I mean
the formula has to be good I could never
tell obviously about the formula but by
looking at the wand I can tell if I'm
gonna like it or not and that looks like
a wand I would like but you never know I
might hate it to nose but that's awesome
then we get mascara I love getting
mascara in boxes and this is a full-size
mascara and it is $22 so it's definitely
a pricier mascara
very last thing in the Box is this look
how cute it's by Coastal Scents and it
is there
blush and bronzer mini palette and brush
combo but see what's been Fixman okay
let's swatch with that that like a
highlight maybe not on my skin tone they
feel really creamy oh that look that's
actually a really nice color right there
this one is a shimmery bronzer and then
this one is more of a matte bronzer
these swatches suck and then it comes
with two blushes on top I really like
this light blush color that's probably
the one that I would wear i swatch them
both right here that one is too dark for
me but it would work really nicely on
deep skin tones so that's nice
and this of course is a full palette and
it retails for 3095 but I believe that
Coastal Scents always has it on sale for
six dollars so really really really
inexpensive so the liquid lipstick has
not 1000% dried yet like it's
transferring a little bit on the edges
but the middle part or the inside has
dried it looks like it would be a really
nice formula so so yeah that completes
this video these were all the products I
got in my box t-shirt the overall value
of this month's box was 105 dollars and
the box retails for $21 a month I'm
