map up see she removed LexA
the time is going by so fast but I feel
like I just filmed this video like last
week good it's been a month
what what I miss mind I notice and don't
miss miners alright anyway you know all
these videos works let's just let's just
jump in this is what the box looks like
this month the theme is beach please
meet I just started my cup of coffee
today it's early in the morning it just
woke up and my makeup came here that's
on this video and I just had one cup of
coffee but I feel like I'm bouncing off
the wall already okay so the first thing
that's large and in charge right here
is this palette this is so cool I was so
excited to see that we got this in the
bowl this is the Tarte rainforest of the
sea palette and this is volume 2
I don't even know what probably one
looks like and I'm going to be honest
I've never really used any of these like
little realm palettes that tart comes
out with sometimes let's go cute this
one it's like little stuff in the old
chain a little and this is what the
palette looks like on the inside I was
really excited to see that these were
very neutral shades but I like this
because it's perfect for like the
everyday consumer and if you're someone
just into natural makeup in general
these colors are better for you I would
I would assume so let me zoom you in and
we are going to test out some of these
eyeshadows on my eyes there is a brush
set in the ball is there any eye brushes
in here yeah there's one I might as well
show you because I want to use this eye
brush and it's from the brand cause mold
a pro this is the MOBA pro 3-piece brush
set oh wait this is my royal and
langnickel I love royal and I'm gonna go
and make a lot of good stuff so as
guessing this is like one of their brand
and these brushes look so pretty
oh that's all wow it feels really nice I
am going to try out this version just
add like a little bit more bronzer you
know I might as well do it right now
okay let's skip the eye shadow powder
for a second I just want to see how this
brush applies my bronzer so I'm going to
take a little bit of my girl on
terracotta bronze
here this is really good - like contour
with because it comes to like that nice
little point mmm
you could start right here like at the
point to contour and then put it on its
side and that helps you blend everything
I probably have a million brushes that
look like this already but this one
feels really nice and it's incredibly
soft and I see myself using this all the
time it's probably really good for blush
- they also have this in the trio this
is the chisel brush but I'm going to be
completely honest with you guys I'm
never going to use this brush it's just
not my type of brush coating to know how
to use this so that brush and then the
third brush in the little trio is a
crease brush and this is also very very
soft
this brush trio retails for $26 and this
eyeshadow palette retails for $36 okay
so I'm going to take this nude color and
I'm just going to put this on my entire
lid
I have concealer on my lid I was kind of
like a primer
and then I'm going to take this one
called marina and I am going to put that
in my crease you guys know I always do
the same kind of look and all my boxes
from videos but that's just because I'm
really just testing out the formula of
the eyeshadows not so much trying to do
a full look here because if not this
video would be like 100 years long I
wonder how many times I say that phrase
these eyeshadows feel so weird because
when you put your finger in them they
almost feel like a cream so I kind of
feel like it's a little bit hard to pick
up the eye shadow on the brush you just
have to dip back into the eyeshadow just
a few times which I'm okay with but
definitely just keep that in mind if
you're not used to eyeshadows like this
and there also is like no kick up like
at all
I'm going to go into this color here
it's called seaside it's just a little
bit darker than marina and I'm just
going to apply this to the outer corners
and into the crease of the wheedle you
know I find so weird I'm sure a lot of
you guys have seen Gilmore Girls I just
recently saw it for the very first time
when a year in the life came out as I
was called when that came out I was like
okay fine I have to watch Gilmore Girls
so I recently watched it and of course I
loved it I took one of those like
feel-good shows kind of cheesy but you
know makes you feel good and now that I
have zero shows to watch I've seen big
little lies by the way which is
incredible if you have not seen big
little lies you need to it's on HBO it's
a little dark but don't let that throw
you off because I can handle it and I
can't handle a lot it is so good and the
acting is amazing I just I love it so
much and now I have no other show to
watch so I have been watching
Supernatural I know that's weird because
there's like 75 seasons I think 75 76
and it's been on for a million years but
I wanted to show that I could just like
kind of play in the background and not
pay too much attention to it so it's not
working supernatural I had seen it a few
years ago but the Bloody Mary episode
scared me too much so I stopped watching
but now I'm watching it again and I
really really like it it's not as scary
as I thought it was going to be I just
can't watch it at night but anyways the
point of this whole story is that it's
so weird to see him on supernatural as
Sam when he's be nindo more girls and
yet and brother is being in Supernatural
so it's so weird every time I watch it
I'm like why it got him in beam does
your name
okay now I'm going to go into the deeper
brown I'm just I'm just using all these
Browns here and I'm just going to focus
this one see like there's no fallout at
all
I'm going to go back into Marina which
is like that first creature we use I'm
just going to blend everything and I'm
just going to take that same brush on
the seaside shades and I'm just going to
run that on my lower lash line I will
use a different brush but since I want
this color pretty much like everywhere
down there
and I'm going to take a little bit of
the deep shade and just add that ride
and be outta kolnas then on this little
morphe y20 brush i'm going to take this
this one pearl i'm going to use this to
highlight my browbone i'm also going to
put that on my inner corners so cleanly
like and a little bit right in here
actually I'm going to take a little bit
of sunset and I'm going to apply that
right on top of this white right in here
as well okay so really quickly before I
apply some mascara there is another
little thing in the box this is from the
brand bellapierre and this is their
waterproof gel eyeliner and it retails
for 15 doulas supposed to glide on
smoothly and it's formulated with pure
minerals natural waxes and antioxidants
this is just a black color it's called
evany I feel like it's a little rough I
need a sharpener but I don't have one on
hands with me right now it's a little
it's a little step not a huge fan of
this eyeliner I mean it did the job it
works it's just not anything special
going as a ton of black eyeliners on the
market that are better than this so this
one was a little bit of like a mess
product for me but let me tell you I've
been rubbing this for a good minute
sitting here and this will not come off
so impressive saying powder but still an
aesthetic for me the other product that
was in this box that has to do which
eyes are some falsies these are the pro
eye lashes from the brand pur they are
3d cruelty free luxe lashes and you can
use them up to 30 times which is intense
I don't know if I would use these 30
times actually looks so incredibly
beautiful like let me show you
they look so fluttery and wispy they
remind me of mink eyelashes
are actually supposed to be similar to
mingle ashes without having Ming care
they are handcrafted with the finest
cruelty-free silk to provide ultra
lightweight natural-looking fuller
lashes I actually don't want to use
these on my eyes right now so I don't
want to ruin them I know you can use
them up to 30 times but I'm not going
anywhere right now I'm honestly just
going to take off all my makeup and edit
one of my videos so I honestly rather
save these for a makeup tutorial if you
really want to see them on my eyes I
will use them in a makeup tutorial
coming up just so you can see them so
keep an eye out for that but they are
really really gorgeous and these retail
for $14 which is not terrible
considering how much mink lashes are
there like in the $30 range so this is
like half what I mean
falsies are like five bucks right at the
drugstores I guess these are pretty
expensive for what they are but I don't
know so I'm going to pop on some mascara
and I will be right back to try on the
left box all right so the last thing in
the Box is the this is a liquid lipstick
from the brand the beauty crop and this
is a girl-power liquid lipstick and it
retails for 14.95 an intensely pigmented
liquids of six that is life proof with
serious staying power lifeproof cruelty
free no parabens oh no famine family
baking boot and free shea butter vitamin
E all of the gusto
this is what the packaging looks like I
really like it it's very pleasing and
it's called date night so let's see it's
very very very since very liquidy so how
amazing
wow this is really comfortable and I
still smell it like the scent is so
delicious and I smell it right here I
like it even more than I thought I would
you see remember I mean does it really
transfer that much it only transfers a
little bit but it doesn't feel drying at
all actually kissing my hand it takes
them off right there let me apply a
little bit more and wait for it to like
fully dry it does transfer just a little
bit but it's pretty matte and it feels
really comfortable so these are probably
not kiss proof I mean I literally don't
understand how people can put on a lip
product and then kiss somebody I mean
sweet strong but I can't either I don't
know you know like in TV shows when a
girl is like about to kiss a boy and
then she puts lip gloss huh before she
kisses a bland like what are you doing
what what wait what are you doing where
would you put on the book what why many
only one that feels that way when I see
people kissing on TV and one of them is
wearing a lip product on me
okay so yeah I was loving this like five
seconds ago but I stayed a little bit on
the inside here maybe you shouldn't eat
with this product on either because I'm
just assuming I like the oils of your
food we'll take this right off but I
love this color
and it feels really comfortable I play
around with it a little bit more see I
can make it work so that completes this
video guys I hope you enjoyed it the
overall value of this box is over $100
I'm going to say it again which is
amazing considering you only pay $21 I
will leave the box term website down
below in case you're interested yeah let
me know if you like to your boxycharm
