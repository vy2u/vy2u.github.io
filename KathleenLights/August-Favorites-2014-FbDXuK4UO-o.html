my August favorites these are products I
have been loving in the month of August
and I have really been loving a lot of
things this month so this video is going
to be long okay so I'm going to start
off with brushes I just want to give
these brushes a mention because I have
fallen completely in love with this
brand and it is morphe brushes that is
the name of the brand and their brushes
are fantastic they're such high quality
brushes actually got this brush in my
boxycharm this month and it is an
amazing face brush really really soft
but I have been so crazy about their eye
brushes it says their fluffy blending
brush and it is the MV 23 and it is my
go-to fluffy brush now it is so good and
actually ordered their individual
eyeshadows and I have a palette from
them if you want to see like a whole
morphe brushes video review then comment
down below and I will film that video
for you but this company has a brand
they are really really good so the next
thing I've been loving are these josie
maran coconut water color eyeshadows
there are the most beautiful liquid
eyeshadows i have ever seen it kind of
looks like a dropper but when you
unscrew the cap it has a doe foot
applicator so it makes it really really
easy to put on your eyelids when you let
them sit for a while it does separate
and all the pigment stays at the bottom
and then you have like all the liquid at
the top so you do have to shake it up
before you use it every single time but
once you shake it and you apply it to
your eyes you get the most beautiful
metallic finish like the most metallic
eyeshadows I have ever seen in my life
so crazy pigmented I was blown away the
first time I ever saw these I have here
real dear rose gold and Playa del pink
Playa del pink is probably my all-time
favorite actually have Playa del pink on
my inner corner right now all I did was
stamp it right in the inner corner and
that's all I have and honestly I think
these josie maran eyeshadows are worth
every single penny they're great I think
they're about $18 don't quote me on that
but they're worth every penny
I love them
and I just haven't put them down there
so good next thing I want to talk about
is this eyeshadow from Milani cosmetics
they came out with a whole range of new
eyeshadow is called the Bella eyes
shadows and I have really been loving
this one specifically this one is called
Bella chiffon and in the pan it just
looks like a regular basic like yellow
white color but once you apply it to
your skin it gives such a nice gold
Sheen I don't know how to explain it it
has like an iridescent of gold and I
have been using this like crazy as a
highlight for my face I love those
really intense Goldy white colors and
this one is absolutely beautiful super
pigmented and goes on amazingly it's
also a great inner corner highlight
underneath the brow bone overall a great
great I shadow to own I definitely
recommend this one so recently I have
been self-tanning a lot more than I used
to actually have in self 10 in like a
week but I've been self-tanning more
than I used to and I find exfoliating
your body before applying self-tanner is
extremely essential if you want an even
self tan application and I have been
using this body scrub from tree hut and
it is there shave your body scrub in
coconut lime I cannot tell you how good
this is I know everybody's crazy about
the Bath and Body Works body scrub and
like the body shop and stuff like that
but this was under $5 I believe and I
got mine at the grocery store it's
really really inexpensive and it works
so well it kind of looks like a jelly
like in the in the tub but the sugars
are so finely milled that they really do
a great job of exfoliating my skin but
it doesn't dry my skin out I honestly
feel no joke that when I apply this to
my skin when I rinse it off my skin is
extremely extremely moisturized kind of
leaves like a layer of hydration on my
skin I don't know how to explain it but
I love using this I use this religiously
every time I'm going to go self-tan this
is what I use in the shower and it is
fantastic and super cheap the next thing
I want to talk about our lip products
that have completely rocked my world
this month I have honestly been using
them non-stop that I haven't even given
any of my other lip products a chance
and it's kind of a combination of a
bunch of different things but they're
all from Too Faced and this is actually
like the star of the show this is the
thing that I have honestly loved so much
and it is the Too Faced perfect lips lip
liner in the shade perfect nude this is
what's on my lips right now I've used it
in a few of my recent videos and it is
fantastic I used it to fill in my entire
lips today and it is so so great this
lasts all day on me I usually wear this
when I go out to dinner because food
does not disrupt this at all it lasts a
really really long time the color is
just beautiful these are the kind of
colors I've been going for recently the
baiji deeper kind of nude pinks I love
it so I definitely recommend this lip
liner if you're looking for that perfect
nude lip liner this is it and as for
lipsticks I have been loving these two
new lipsticks from Too Faced
these are like the la creme lipsticks I
think they might be the only lipsticks
they have but there's such good quality
I love the packaging it is so beautiful
I love gold and I love the scent it's
not like a weird creepy if a send could
be creepy it's not a creepy scent it
smell really nice and for nude lipsticks
they have one of the best formulas I
have come across when it comes to nude
lipsticks I feel like you have to wear
one that has a good formula because
sometimes new lipsticks just don't look
good on the lips and these two look
great I have naked dolly and nude beach
Nick they're very similar naked dolly is
just a little bit lighter that's like a
hint of more peach in there when nude
beach is a little bit more on like the
beige side a little bit darker but
they're both really really beautiful and
it got super dark outside all of a
sudden it's like about to rain cats and
dogs so maybe I should speed this up
okay so my go-to Foundation recently
honestly has been my Maybelline fit me
foundation this is kind of a newer
purchase to be
I don't know why I never tried this
before because the fit me powder is
great and the fit me concealer is my
favorite concealer at the drugstore so I
don't know what took me so long to give
this a try this is so great I recommend
this for anyone who has um dry skin
because it is a dewy finish really
really fresh light to medium coverage
and you just look nice and dewy and it
gives a beautiful natural finish I have
mine in the shade 220 it's not what I'm
wearing today because this is my self
tanner shade but I have been using a non
stop I actually have a drugstore like
dewy foundation tutorial coming your way
with this guy so look out for that okay
a product that I'm surprised I loved so
much this is actually sent to me by a
subscriber named Amy in my peel box
Thank You Amy because I love this this
is the prestige brow perfection brow
building system and you can get prestige
cosmetics at Ulta I don't know where
else but I know they have it at Ulta and
it's basically like a brow jewel where
you get a clear brow gel and then you
get a tinted brow gel on this side I
haven't used a clear brow gel because I
love the tinted brow gel section open it
you see that it has like these little
fibers on it which leads me to believe
that it's kind of like their version of
benefits gimme brow I haven't tried
benefits gimme rep I'm thirsty I haven't
tried benefits gimme brow so I can't
tell you if it's a Duke and I don't
really notice that much that the fibers
go on to my eyebrows at all actually
but I love the fact that it tints my
eyebrows and it sets them like cement
for the entire day like they are just in
place like all day but it isn't
waterproof so if you're like running in
the rain girl your eyebrows are going to
melt off because like all I got to do is
swipe this with water and it comes off
it sets them really nicely and it gives
them a nice tint and I have just really
been liking this and it and it's really
inexpensive okay so this product
I'm obsessed with I have been looking
for a really good silicone free primer
for a long time don't get me wrong I
love primers that fill in my pores I
love that silicone primer but if I use a
silicone primer too many days in a row
it clogs my pores really bad so I have
been on the hunt for one with no
silicone and I found one that I actually
really really love it is the Too Faced
hangover primer hangover RX or hangover
I don't know
it says replenishing face primer with
coconut water electrolytes and
probiotics doesn't that just sound good
I actually really do like this and
honestly the first time I heard this was
from Emily Noelle 83 she's did a whole
review on this and she actually didn't
like it she said it just felt like a
moisturizer going on her face but I
wanted to give it a chance anyway
because you guys know that my skin is so
incredibly dry and I was on the hunt for
a silicone free primer anyway so I gave
it a chance and I picked it up and I
ended up really really loving it I
recommend this for anyone with dry skin
because I do feel like it prolongs wear
of my makeup and it leaves my skin super
smooth and hydrated and moisturized I
love it it just makes my foundation go
on a lot prettier especially if it's
like a matte foundation perfect pairing
I love this so much
Too Faced has really been impressing me
lately and if you have dry skin and you
want a primer that silicone free I
recommend the hangover one okay so I
found a new Holy Grail highlight if you
guys been watching my channel for a
while you know that the Physicians
Formula shimmer strip in the shade Miami
strip is my go-to it is my favorite
highlight of all time high-end or
drugstore amazing they recently came out
with new shimmer strips that don't
really look like the original it's
different packaging and they're not
strips they are little blocks instead
but this is their new shimmer strip in
natural nude and I couldn't be more
obsessed this highlight is so incredibly
pigmented it's oh it has a beautiful
sheen on the cheeks there's no chunks of
glitter and it doesn't look sparkly or
weird you know how some highlighters
just have like weird dots of glitter
and it doesn't look like a sheen I like
a sheen you know not really a shame this
one gives you that and it's so pretty I
usually like to swirl my brush in
products like this but each individual
box is so beautiful on its own that I
don't do that with this product I
usually take my brush and dunk it right
here and use this as my highlight it's
actually what I have as a highlight on
my cheek bones today and it is beautiful
I love it these are also really great
eyes shadows like if you want to really
bronzy smoky eye this section right here
girlfriend it is good I recommend this
100% worth the money probably one of the
best highlighters at the drugstore right
now so incredible and it also has a
mirror in the back just in case you were
wondering I know you've heard a thousand
times from a thousand different
youtubers about makeup geek blushes and
how they're great and they're so amazing
but I'm here to talk about one that I
don't hear people talking about and it
is this one right here and it is called
honeymoon I am obsessed it's probably my
favorite makeup geek blush that I own
and I don't feel like many people like
it there are silver glitters in this
there are little silver specks of
glitter and when you apply them to your
cheeks you kind of see them but it's
nothing that bothers me this is the
blush I am wearing on my cheeks right
now and I love it I think it gives you
such a like romantic soft look to your
face it's really really good for a very
very very very fair skin up until like a
medium skin tones it's just it's
beautiful when I don't hear a lot of
people talking about it and I don't know
why because it's great they're
inexpensive blushes for the quality
they're beautiful they're amazing and
honeymoon is been one that I have been
using non friggin stop so recently they
discontinued my all-time favorite base
coat and top coat and it is and it was
the color say the Revlon Colorstay base
coat and top coat I know that they came
out now with like they discontinued that
one to come out with like the Revlon
nail gel envy topcoat diamond top
or something like that and I still
haven't seen their new base coat but
their original color stay was my
favorite for so long
discontinued cry cry cry sob sob but I
found something I might like better it's
a little bit more expensive but it's
worth it and they are the formula X base
coat and top coat you get this brand at
Sephora it's formula x4 Sephora and
these are great the top coat leads your
nails looking very very shiny and I like
it but the star is this guy
this is the best base coat I have ever
used this blows my Revlon one out of the
water honestly it does it's makes my
nail polish last such a long time when
you apply this to your nails it has like
a sticky feeling it stays pretty sticky
so that your nail polish really adheres
to it and it stays stuck to the base
coat so great it's ten dollars but it's
worth the money because it prolongs your
nails you know they look good for a
longer time and I love it
okay and last thing is kind of weird and
really talked about products like this
but it is a body milk and it is the John
masters organics blood orange and
vanilla body milk I get my John masters
organics products from hip Aquatica calm
this is the best smelling body
moisturizer lotion milk that I have ever
smelled in the history of time oh I got
a spray I got a put some on that's brave
I love it because it's a body milk I'm
not a fan of lotions or that thick weird
body butter stuff I've just never been a
fan of it I hate the feeling on my hands
I don't like it
but this hydrates my skin but yet it's
milky so it glides all over my skin and
instantly my skin drinks it up and it
kind of disappears but you still feel
really really soft and really really
hydrated and the scent this smell is
identical to fruity pebbles i dint
and I love the scent of fruity pebbles
it's my favorite cereal
well after Captain Crunch crunch berries
it's been so shocked with this product
it's so good so moisturizing and the
scent I would bathe myself in the scent
I would perfume myself in the scent
probably the best smelling lotion I have
ever smelled ok guys so that completes
this video these are all the products I
have really been loving in the month of
August and it's been a good month
product wise yeah you guys so much for
