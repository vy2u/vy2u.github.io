my August favorites these are product I
have been loving in the month of August
um and can you tell that I'm trying to
hang on to summer as much as I can this
is probably the last day I'll be wearing
a crazy combo like this very summery but
honestly I'm really excited to embark on
fall because normally well I've been
living in Mississippi the past five
years so normally this time of year in
Mississippi I'm like Great Falls coming
and then it's gonna be winter because it
is way too cold for me in Mississippi
since you guys know I'm from Miami
so it's depressing so winter season for
me was so depressing in Mississippi
every year but I'm excited for a winter
now because there's no such thing as
winter here in South Florida and
honestly at this point is just way too
hot in Florida like way too hot I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started on my
favorite products this month though I
want to talk about face wipes and that
may seem really weird but these face
wipes are like they've taken over my
life I'm usually the type of person that
will just buy any face wipe when Dixie
brand I really like the simple ones but
like I'll just buy any of them these are
the Murad clarifying wipes for blemish
prone skin it says it's clinically
proven to keep skin clear by removing
dirt bacteria and pore clogging oil
reduces shine balances and tightens
pores and usually I would stay far far
far away from these because this looks
like it would be better for oily skin
but these are freaking phenomenal these
were sent to me by Murad and I already
bought two backups like that's how
seriously in love with them I am they
are pricey but these make my skin better
I don't know how I don't I don't know
how it says it has a witch hazel algae
extract and then it has vitamin E it is
so good it literally tingles on your
face like when you are taking your
makeup off it's like umm someone threw a
bucket of mint sensation all over your
face it's minty on the skin and like
when you're done taking off all your
makeup you feel nice and cooling and I
love these I purchased these again and
again
after trying this and these for sure
will be my go to face wipes forever
because they are that amazing alrighty
then
so ok I want to talk about nail care for
a second this is by the brand nail tech
and it is their intensive therapy for
soft peeling nails ever since I've been
using this I have noticed a difference
in my nails my mom used to use this all
the time and she was the one that was
like go buy it it's gonna solve your
problem
I have very pili nails like for some
reason my nail beds are always peeling
and I don't know if I'm like lacking
vitamins or something but I have like
soft pili nails so I've been using this
as a base coat and it hasn't really
strengthened my nails it's not a nail
hardener but my nails don't peel up as
much
therefore my nail polish doesn't chip as
fast I really love it I use it as a base
coat even though it doesn't make my nail
polish last longer
but since my nails don't peel as much my
nails last longer does that make sense I
don't know my point is that I only
wanted to mention it just in case you're
having the same problem I do wear your
nails are peeling all the time like your
actual nail I would definitely check out
the nail tech intensive therapy and then
I want to give a quick shout out to this
bad boy right here this is from a brand
called glisten and glow I believe the
website is glisten and glow calm and
that is where I bought this this is the
HK girl fast drying and super shiny
clear topcoat if you guys are right or
die Seche vite or sashay vite I don't
have to say it if you guys are right or
die Seche vite lovers you will give up
such beat if you try this I know that's
a big claim this is so much better it
pretty much does the exact same thing it
makes your nails really thick and shiny
and they dry within seconds I could put
this on my nails
and my nail polish dries so freaking
fast it's pretty amazing but it doesn't
get goopy or thick I am halfway through
this bottle and it's not getting thick
it's not getting gross Seche vite you
could barely use the whole bottle you
get halfway through the bottle and then
it gets too thick that you have to throw
it away or buy like that Seche vite
restorer thing you don't need to do that
with this
amazing I highly recommend this top go
this is the issue a matte moisture tint
sunscreen it has SPF 15 it's oil-free
hypoallergenic and fragrance free this
does have a physical SPF into this
product so it doesn't break me out at
all a doddle I get no irritation with
this product they have to they have the
matte moisture tint and then they have
the luminizing one and you would think I
that I would like that one more and I
have that one and I do really love that
one but I like this one just a little
bit more and this is the one that I have
been using all freakin month for the
past week and a half I've been using the
BB water by Smashbox but I have haven't
been using it that long to talk about it
this is what I've been going for all
month though it's what I'm wearing on my
skin right now and it's matte but it's
not flat it's not cakey looking and it
gives really really good coverage for
being a tinted moisturizer I have
recently been trying out as UA products
and I love them I love their
highlighting pen in golden light I
believe it's amazing I use it all the
time and mixture with this I don't know
I just really really have been liking
this product I want to talk about a
brush this is the morphe M 500 I can't
stop using this this is my one-stop shop
like on days where I don't even want to
bother with my makeup I will just bronze
my skin with this put on my blush with
this and I'm good to go
I love that it comes to like a tapered
point so you can contour with it but
then you could just put it on its side
and bronze with it and put on your blush
with it it's such a great brush and it's
like $12 I love it I highly recommend
this Mac makes one that's just like this
but it's 42 bucks and unfortunately I I
have that one I bought it and then I
discovered this and I haven't looked
back it's so good and it's so soft think
of it as a giant crease brush it's
amazing I do have a 10% off code with
morphe by the way it is an affiliate
code so if you don't want to use it I
totally understand but you can save 10%
anyway I just want to mention this
because I've been using it all the time
so apparently it can't be a
kathleenlights favorites video without
me mentioning highlights I have been so
obsessed with this highlight and I've
had it for so long now and now is when
I'm really breaking out this bad boy I
mentioned it on Instagram and I posted a
picture wearing it and I was talking
about how I couldn't get enough of it it
is the color pop super shock cheek
highlight in the shade wisp this is only
eight dollars amazing it's a dupe for
Becca's shimmering skin perfecter in
opal but to me because of its texture
it's a little bit more intense I love
this it lasts all day because of the
formula I just feel like it stays on my
cheeks all day and I have been using
wisp like it's going out of style but
recently you guys know that I have been
like obsessed with the ofra liquid
lipsticks like I can't stop wearing him
I'm wearing Santa Monica on my lips
right now I cannot stop wearing it and
then I decided that I was gonna bust
this out because I got this in a boxy
charm a couple months ago and I loved it
when I first used it but then I kind of
put it away and didn't think about it
but since I had been on an Oprah kick I
decided to pop this bad boy out
and this is the Oprah blush strips in
the shade illuminating and this is what
it looks like I got it in a boxy charm I
got it in a box charm and it's amazing
this is the highlight I'm wearing right
now uh Porter didn't like that noise I
just made it looks like my cheeks are
wet
does it not does it no it might be too
much for some people I could totally
understand that but to me the more glowy
the better I don't care
and all I did was dip my brush into the
very first shade up here it's like a
pinky champagne color right at the top
and then I used the white one to
highlight my nose and if I want a pinky
highlight I just dip my brush into this
pink one I don't use this gold one
because it is too dark for my skin tone
I do have for a very limited time a no
for a coupon code you can get any of the
our liquid lipsticks or anything else on
their website and I can save you guys
40% you get 40% off of the Oprah website
using my coupon code Kathleen for tea
I'll have the coupon code below a lot of
you guys have been tweeting me saying
that you've been using my code and how
much money you've saved so that's
awesome but yeah I have been loving this
so much okay so my next product I want
to thank one of you guys for it because
actually I want to thank a lot of you
guys for it because if you commented on
my videos saying that I should check
this product out and then I got a bunch
of lights and people were like yes I
love that product so this was a
recommendation from pretty much a lot of
you this is the L'Oreal True Match super
blendable concealer I have mine an N one
two three fair light this is the
concealer I'm wearing underneath my eyes
it gives me really nice coverage but it
blends like a dream it's true it's true
True Match super blendable I'm not even
kidding I could use my fingers with this
and it's like padded twice and my
concealers blended in my face perfectly
I have been wearing this non-stop on my
no makeup makeup days I have just been
putting this underneath my eyes and I
also bring it on to my eye to conceal
any veins and it has been working great
it lasts all day and I really like this
and it's from the drugstore so sheep I
love it so recently I have just been
loving touch up products as you guys
know I raved about that dewy skin mists
that I bought it's still pricey but it's
so good
outside and what I choked on my own
saliva anyway let's move on this is the
tacha
silken pore perfecting sunscreen
broad-spectrum I can barely speak I'm
still kind of like SPF 35 in the summer
time I become like SPF obsessed I mean I
still use SPF during the winter because
the Sun doesn't go away so we're still
affected by it but during the summer I'm
like crazy and recently I have just
loved this I have been using this as a
primer because really does a good job of
not emphasizing the pores like it kind
of glides over your face and it almost
erases your pores not really like a not
like benefits Porefessional but it just
evens out my skin it kind of makes it
like really smooth even like the lines
around my mouth it just moves on my face
so when I don't want to wear makeup when
I don't have anything with SPF on my
face I have been using this or I have
been using it as a primer like I said I
have just been using it non-stop I love
it so much and I'm not exactly sure this
is a physical SPF but it has not broken
me out so I want to assume I really want
to try the tatcha rice enzyme exfoliator
I believe that's what it's called leave
me a comment down below if you've tried
it I really want to try that next but
living this okay so let's talk about lip
products I know that I have not shut up
about the over liquid lipsticks but what
I haven't been wearing those I have been
wearing these this is such a great
lipstick and it's so affordable and I
have just been throwing this into my
purse recently this is the elf
moisturizing lipstick in the shade in
the nude in the nude this is like a my
lips look browner it's such a pretty
color it's brown but it's a sheer
coverage so it's not super super opaque
which I really really like that I used
this in my back to school makeup
tutorial and it kind of dries down to a
nice satin matte finish I just really
have been loving this lipstick I'm so
happy that I have it it's good and then
when I'm not wearing this elf one and
I'm not wearing Oprah I have been
wearing this since I found out that this
came out I purchased it and I'm obsessed
this is the NARS lip gloss in the shade
Chelsea girls if you're familiar with
NARS they used to have a pot lip gloss
in the shade Chelsea girls and I loved
it but I never wanted to buy it
because I hate pot lip glosses that you
have to like unless it's a lip balm so
even though I really liked that color I
never wanted to buy it for that reason
and it was really really sticky the ones
in the pot were like so sticky and I
think those are like discontinued now
but they came out with Chelsea girls in
lip gloss form and I'm so excited I
loved the color so much
so happy when I saw this it's not as
sticky it's just their regular NARS
formula and it's a beautiful beautiful
beautiful peachy color and I like that
it's not super super super opaque it has
a glossy finish but it's a big enough to
just wear on its own and it's a
beautiful peachy lip color so I have
been loving that why can't I ever
shorten down my favorites videos okay so
I have been obsessed with oils I've
actually been using this product for
about two months now and I'm finally
talking about it because I really wanted
to test it out this is the origins high
potency night immense skin refining oil
so many of you guys tweeted me like your
holy grill face moisturizer is now in
oil form because if you guys know I have
been using the night immense mineral
enriched renewal renewal cream for like
two years now
and it's my favorite nighttime
moisturizer nothing will ever compare to
that and then origins came out with this
the night immens and a skin refining oil
and I was really thrown off when I first
used this it says to warm up three to
five drops in the palm of your hand and
then apply it to your face and I did
that and it felt like I wasn't putting
on an oil this is like the thinnest most
non oily oil I have ever used in my life
like honestly it feels like I'm putting
on water like an oily water I don't know
how to explain it it's so thin if you
have its I don't know if you could tell
it's not oily at all like I don't know
if you guys have oily skin I think you
might really love this because it is an
oil but it's a very very very thin oil
it's not like argan oil it's not thick
it's not super you know so I've been
using this underneath my moisturizer
when I'm not using my drunk elephant
serum which I'm still using but it cost
me an arm and a leg so I try to use it
very sparingly when I'm not using that I
am using this so I use this about three
times a week and I love how it makes my
skin feel when I wake up it's like that
combined with the moisturizer plump I
really love it and when I want to get
real gray what I want to get real cray
I have been dropping these this into my
moisturizer into that origins
moisturizer this is the cover effects
some infusion drops I've only been using
this for about a week so I am totally
cheating but I had to tell you guys
about it because the first time I used
it when I woke up the morning I was like
my skin looks beautiful they have
different ones but this is the hydrating
one so it has vitamin F with neroli I
don't know what neroli is but it's
basically a mix of vitamins and
essential oil and it made my skin look
so plump and hydrating when I mixed it
in with my moisturizer I also used this
by itself completely at night time last
night I completely skipped my skincare
routine last night I got a shower after
washing my face and I felt so bad I had
a stomach ache that I just threw this on
my face I didn't even put on eye cream
or my moisturizer I just threw this on
and when I woke up I was pleasantly
surprised and my skin looked super
hydrated and like think what and then
the last product I want to talk about I
just want to briefly touch base on it
this is from the brand la vanilla and
this is their healthy body butter and
this is in pure vanilla if you only if
you like vanilla scents please go out
and buy this I wear this during the day
at nighttime I use a more oil based
moisturizer for my skin but during the
day like if I'm changing and I'm wearing
shorts I will apply this to my legs and
my arms and I smell super vanilla the
whole day this lingers on your skin in
the most beautiful way possible and it
really really hydrates my skin I'm crazy
about it like Danny's like you smell so
good and it's always my cream or excuse
me cream was in your coffee it's always
my lotion anyway so that was everything
it's I haven't actually these aren't
very exciting products right if you like
my video my favorites this month it was
a little boring so yeah leave me a
comment down below telling me what your
favorite product was this month and
maybe I'll check it out thank you guys
