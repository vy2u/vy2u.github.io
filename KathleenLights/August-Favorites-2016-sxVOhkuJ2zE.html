my August favorites these are products
I've been loving in the month of August
and I know that some of you are confused
I always post my favorites videos either
on the very last day of the month or on
the first of the following month
depending on what day that lands the
video that I wanted to post on Monday I
didn't get a chance to film so I have to
post that video on Wednesday and I
didn't want to leave you guys hanging
without a video on Monday so I am
filming my favorites video a couple days
early so I'm just gonna jump into the
products
my first favorite has to be a little
baby right here this is the
kathleenlights highlighter palette I
recently teamed up with makeup geek and
I helped create this highlight palette
this is the box it comes in I didn't get
a chance to show you guys this box when
I made that announcement video so I just
wanted to show it to you guys I think
it's so pretty
it is a sleeve so the highlight just
slips right out we highlight palette and
then it says like kathleenlights
highlighter palette on the back and it
has the names of the highlights so this
is what it looks like on the inside
I am completely completely in love with
this I'm actually wearing this on my
face right now I first started off with
the shade starlight here in the middle
it's a very pearly pinky shade I had
that on the tops of my cheekbones but
then after I put on this orange lipstick
I wanted my highlight to be a little bit
more golden so I just topped it off with
night light I love the way that these
two highlight shades look mixed together
I am so happy that you guys are loving
the palette as much as I am you guys
have just been so sweet on social media
especially since a lot of people
complained that the shades were just too
dark so many of you guys were so
supportive about that saying that you
really love the shade selections well
thank you so much I love that this
palette works for a lot of skin tones I
actually posted a picture on Instagram
the other day with my friends Ari I'll
post it right here my friend Gabby did
Sarris makeup and she was actually
wearing the deep shade in the palette
this color is called sunlight and it's a
really pretty bronzy gold and on her
skin tone it looked so beautiful oh yeah
definitely
the Kevon light
her palate has been a favorite this
month I even took the shade sunlight and
I added some of it on the center of my
lips kind of give a little bit of a
metallic gold finish to the orange
lipstick and I think it looks pretty
cool I will have the link to the palette
listed down below in case you are
interested so my next favorite is
actually the hourglass vanish foundation
I was kind of going back and forth with
this product because when I first tried
this out in the video I kind of
mentioned that I didn't think it was
worth the money because it is a pretty
pricey foundation but the more I wear it
the more I realized that I do think it's
worth the money
I just really truly do love this and
actually when I filmed that video a lot
of you guys were saying that thick
foundations don't typically have as much
product as liquid foundations because in
the video I was like what point 25
ounces this is garbage
foundation is always one ounce but my
other stick foundation doesn't have one
ounce either it's actually point 44
ounces this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick this is actually my holy
grail stick foundation I think it's
amazing this does come with more product
but it still isn't a whole ounce stick
foundations unfortunately come with less
product so you might want to skip on
them for that reason but this one just
has such nice coverage and it feels so
amazing on the skin that I'm gonna go
out on a limb and say that it is worth
the money even though it's it's it
that's a sensitive Tessa spensive but
it's so beautiful it's the foundation
I'm wearing on my skin right now and
I've actually been wearing my makeup for
a few hours it gives you great coverage
without being cakey without being heavy
it's not a completely matte finish but
it's not do either it's like the perfect
in between but wins me over is just the
feeling it feels like I'm not wearing
foundation I have mine in the shade warm
ivory and I have been using this
foundation non-stop I took it with me to
Los Angeles this is the foundation I
wore to my makeup geek launch dinner and
I know that it came with like a specific
brush I personally don't think you need
to buy the brush with the foundation
they're literally like thousands of
other brushes you can use with this my
favorite way to apply this foundation is
actually with this Tarte brush that has
no name only downside is that you get a
little bit of product and it is a pricey
foundation so that's what Alise sucks
but my next favorite is an oldie but a
goodie this is the Wet n Wild contouring
palette in the shade dulce de leche I
love this new formula I think it is
better than the original and it's
honestly the contour I have been using
all month
it's the perfect undertone like it's
cool enough to contour but it doesn't
leave like a gray stripe on your face
the formula is really buttery and smooth
so easy to blend and I actually really
really love this shade as well there's a
really nice job of brightening the under
eye I just think this duo is awesome and
if you haven't checked this out
definitely do so because it's only a few
dollars and you can get this at
Walgreens Wet n Wild has a different
shade with like a darker bronzer and
with like a yellow highlight but I
personally prefer to to it I have to
blush favorites this month I've actually
really been dabbling into blush in
August the two blushes I'm going to
share with you are literally like nude
shades but still they're beautiful and I
recommend them
so recently whenever I'm like okay I
have to put my makeup on and I need to
put on a blush that's literally going to
last all day this is the blush I go for
this is the Tarte Amazonian clay blush
in the shade sensual the Amazonian clay
blush is from Tarte are some of the best
blushes on the market in my opinion
because they really last forever on the
cheeks and sensual is actually one of
their newer colors a lot of their
blushes are like peaches and pinks and
kind of brighter shades like that but
they released more and it's so exciting
and out of all of their newer ones
sensual is definitely my favorite I also
really really really love risque though
this blush goes with everything I love
goes with everything kind of blushes it
can go with a cool tone look it can go
with a warm tone look these kinds of
blushes are just essential it looks so
soft on the cheeks not too bold but it
still shows up I just I love this color
my other blush favorite is actually a
duo by elf and this is the matte blush
duo in the shade soft and subtle and
it's so funny because while I was
looking at this earlier today these two
blushes
look like sensual but combined doesn't
sensual look like it could be the love
child of these two blurs anyway this
soft and subtle blush duo is so great I
mainly use these two colors together
this is just a little bit too light for
me this doesn't really show up on my
skin if I use it alone but mixed with
this color it's literally perfection
I do wear this one all the time on its
own but when I want a little bit more of
a warmer blush something a little bit
peach here I will mix it in with this
and it looks so beautiful this is the
blush combination I'm wearing on my
cheeks today I mixed both of the colors
I really love the formula of this it
doesn't last as long as the Tarte blush
but this is so so inexpensive so it's
definitely worth it so this next product
should have definitely been in my
ride-or-die makeup video the cover FX
custom enhancer drop in the shade
sunkissed has literally become my
favorite liquid bronzer of all time and
I do have a few that I love like I love
the bare minerals one but this Trump's
those these are pretty pricey but a
little go such a long way you don't
really need a lot with this I know that
everyone keeps raving about like the
highlights which for good reason they're
so beautiful but I feel like the bronzer
shades are not getting enough love and I
don't know why the color is so nice it's
not too warm it actually has a really
nice neutral undertone it blends out so
nicely it never looks spotty or blotchy
or muddy at all like every time I wear
this bronzer my skin just looks
naturally tanned
not like if I added bronzer like if it's
naturally that sunkissed okay so let's
talk about some lip products the Wet n
Wild matte liquid lipstick in the shade
how fleek is your love has been my
favorite red liquid lipstick since I've
discovered it it is so bold and
beautiful also I love the name how fleek
is your love that is so cute I will say
that a few of their other matte liquid
lipsticks are a little bit splotchy on
the lips like the darker shades
definitely look patchy when you're
applying them like you have to go in
with a few layers I don't have that
problem with this one this one is not
patchy whatsoever it goes on so smooth
the formula is kind of
like a typical liquid lipstick it's a
little bit drying but it's not too bad
and it actually lasts a really long time
on my lips my next lip favorite is
actually the colour-pop ultra glossy lip
in the shade fairy floss this is one of
their sheer formulas this is the perfect
everyday throw in your purse nude lip
gloss buxom zweite Russian will always
be the best nude lip gloss in my opinion
but I've never found an affordable
alternative that I like as much as that
it looks so nice layered on top of any
nude lip liner on top of any nude
lipstick it's just so pretty I love it I
have been wearing this all the time this
looks awesome on top of Aquarius if
you've been looking for the perfect
sheer non-sticky nudey pink lip gloss
this is the one for you I will say
because it isn't sticky it doesn't last
as long but I have no problem we're
applying this 100 times a day next up we
have these butter LONDON glazing eye
glosses they don't have the actual name
on the packaging so I had to look that
up these things are unreal and I know
they're pricey they're $24 each which is
crazy to pay that much for like an
eyeshadow but there are unlike anything
I've ever used I have a tutorial using
the shade frosted which is this one
right here they're kind of like a gel
consistency really really weird formula
but it's amazing it looks so glossy and
metallic on your eyes they have a few
different colors and I think that they
are incredible I like to apply these
with my finger I feel like it applies
better that way seriously so pretty just
check one out maybe buy one color that
you know you'll use all the time then
test it out that way but I love these I
think they are so good okay so we're
almost done I want to give a huge shout
out to the orally Pacific Coast Highway
collection these are only four of the
colors the collection has a couple more
shades I bought all of them on Amazon
and I am so impressed with these colors
I recently tried out the neon collection
by OPI and I was not impressed with them
they were pretty sheer and kind of hard
to work with I also did
love the SE neon nail polishes either
they were good but they weren't amazing
these are amazing
they don't need a white nail polish
underneath which that doesn't really
bother me but if I don't have to use it
that's always a plus this color right
here is called road trippin and if you
are into neon yellow highlighter nails
you need this in your life it's very
similar to glow stick by Orly but I
think it's even better than glow stick
they just they did it right they hit it
out of the park I haven't tried all of
them on my nails but they're just so
bold and beautiful without struggling
with a million coats super super
impressed had to give them a shout out
and I should have worn them on my nails
for this video today but I am wearing a
navy blue nail polish instead this is
actually OPI is your so euro it's like a
perfect navy blue and love this nail
polish as well okay guys so that
