my August favorites these are products I
have been really loving throughout the
month of August I don't know how its
September already but it's almost like
every year that passes it just goes
quicker and quicker like it was just my
birthday and it's like coming it's
coming soon but anyway I have a lot of
stuff to share with you guys so I'm just
gonna jump into it I don't want this
video to be a hundred years long so the
first product I want to talk about I
can't believe I've used this much
already you can kind of see where it's
by this is the Smashbox photo finish
primer Iser primer and moisturizer in
one I have been using this every single
day since I used it for the first time
in a video I freaking love this I
wouldn't say it's like my new holy grail
primer but it's definitely one of my
favorites I like this because it really
really hydrates my skin and that's
exactly what my severely dehydrated skin
needs it's not the kind of primer that
makes your makeup stay on for hours and
hours and hours but foundation just
applies so nicely on top even really
matte foundations I have been testing a
lot of matte foundations recently and
even they look really good on top of
this primary just because my skin
transforms from really dry to like nice
and supple and delicious whenever I wear
this I probably use more than I should I
use like four pumps which is a lot but
I'm almost very dry so I have really
really been loving this if you have very
dry skin definitely look into this I
think it's a great step before
foundation I have three highlights to
share with you guys today which is
insane but I've been testing a lot of
highlights apparently and two of them
are by color pop the first one is a
super shock cheek formula these are like
their original formulas and this
highlight is called flexitarian it's
been around for a while but oh my gosh
this is so this is incredible I love
their highlights that are in this
formula but I think this is the best one
I have ever used my friend Gabby uses it
on me every single time we do photo
shoots for ko polish there aren't any
chunky glitters in this it truly is just
like blinding without looking too chunky
I don't know how they do it but it's
amazing it's definitely not natural if
you're looking for a subtle highlight
this is not the one but it's just so
gorgeous this looks amazing and flash
photography it looks amazing
at night like under lights I think this
might be a little bit too light for you
if you have like medium to deep skin
tones because it is a very light shade
but it's not too pearly it's not too
white I know it looks really white but
it has a beautiful champagne undertone
and it's just so incredible this
highlight is probably one of the most
intense highlights in my collection I
have been wearing this for the majority
of the end of the month the other
highlight I'm going to share with you
I've been wearing it mostly throughout
the entire month but ever since I got
this I can't put it down this is the
dose of colors highlighter in fuego it
is one of the highlights that desi and
Katy created for their dose of colors
collection this is the highlight I wear
the most me Tama is just a little bit
too deep for me this one is perfect and
it's crazy because I usually don't love
really golden highlights but it swatches
lighter than it looks in the pan and it
looks so amazing on the skin this is the
highlight I was wearing in my t-shirt
collection video you can go check that
out it's like on my face throughout the
whole video and it's so blinding but in
such a beautiful way not as blinding as
this this can be like borderline too
intense but this just looks beautiful no
matter how much you apply you can get a
really soft subtle application if you
just do one layer or you could build it
up and get like ooh cheeks this is
actually what I'm wearing in my inner
corners right now and kind of like on
the inner parts of my lid you can see
like right here I have the golden shade
and on the inner corners too this is
what I'm wearing it looks beautiful as
my eye shadow and I has a highlight it
makes my cheeks look wet and delicious
and I highly highly recommend this
highlight so the other highlight I have
been wearing the majority of the month
comes from this palette right here this
is the gimme more pressed powder
highlighter palette from colour-pop and
this what the answer looks like and I
have been utterly obsessed with one
shade in this palette I have to be
honest but I mean like I always am with
you guys but the only shades in this
palette I truly love are these two right
here the other ones are not my favorite
I don't really wear orange highlighter
so that's more of like a color thing and
so is this I mean a lot of it is
see a color thing this one is a little
too dark for me and so is this one so I
really only get use out of these three
but I rarely use this one just because
it's so glittery I don't really like
this one at all I gotta be honest these
two I love but this one this one right
here as you can tell it's the one I've
used the most this highlight is golden I
am obsessed with it
please colour-pop release bigger and
better in a single it is my dream
highlight you guys do not understand
it's the highlight I'm wearing on my
cheeks right now I have been wearing it
non-stop it reminds me so much of a
highlighter in this palette I have to
say this is the back disabled
highlighter palette I've spoken about
this in the past
I wear this highlighter palette more
than I wear like any highlighter palette
ever for months now and this color in
the middle is my absolute favorite and
this one reminds me so much of it the
NARS one is just a little bit lighter
and it's a little bit more natural on
the skin this one is really really
intense but it's not chunky or glittery
or too frosty I just it gives you a
really intense glow but it looks so
gorgeous I love this shades so much
please release it in a single I want it
so if I had to pick my favorite types of
blushes they would be nudes and peaches
orange e apricot kind of shades and this
month I have been using the Oprah blush
in might I constantly it's the blush I'm
wearing on my cheeks right now it's very
pigmented so I just dip into this like
one time tap it off and that's how I
apply it and even though it's very
pigmented it's not like overbearing and
it's not hard to blend out so if you
applied too much you can really blend it
out it's a very creamy formula and it
gives you such a fresh look to the skin
it almost looks like a neon peach in a
very subtle way not like neon but I
don't know I'd explain it I don't know I
really really love this bush you can get
this on The Oprah website or the Ulta
website now Ofra is sold at Ulta which
is amazing and another blush I haven't
used this like a ton this month but the
butter blush from Physicians Formula in
the shade vintage Rose is so pretty when
I was really really fair I didn't love
it so much
just because you guys
I don't like too much blush I like a
very subtle blush and even though this
isn't a dark color I just felt like it
looked pretty intense on my skin but now
that I have more of a tan which you
can't tell with these lights but I do I
see that in like every video now I'm
sorry - I know you but now I really
really love this it just looks so pretty
doesn't look too mauve it's almost like
the perfect nude eros it has a little
bit of peach a little bit of pink it has
like a little bit of everything and I
really love this for cool tone looks for
a warm tone looks I think it's like an
all-around good blush so I really wanted
to mention that and it smells amazing
can I say how shocked I am that I love
this so much this is the glossy a router
which is a powder and I got mine in the
shade light/medium I love this powder so
much mainly for its packaging they they
nailed it I love that it's not messy all
it has is this little net right here so
there really is no mess you just grab
any brush this is just the brush it came
with I purchased mine by the way not
that that sways my opinion but it came
in like a little set and I purchased the
set but anyway you just take your brush
dip it into the net and powder comes up
but it's not messy it's pretty freakin
genius and it even comes with a little
stopper right here on the cap so that
product isn't spill everywhere when it's
closed genius genius packaging but not
only is it a pleasant experience to
apply and powder doesn't fly everywhere
but it's truly a great powder this sets
my under-eye concealer that sets my
entire face and it never looks heavy on
the skin it never looks cakey it never
looks dry on me and I really like that
they came out with like three shades so
even those of you with really deep skin
tones can wear this powder and you won't
get like a weird flashback I don't know
I just I love it the formula is on point
the packaging is on point I have really
been liking the new Too Faced Born This
Way powder but I like that when I just
want to set my entire face to give me
like a little bit of a sheen this one
doesn't give you a sheen it kind of like
mattifies the skin but in a really
natural way right now let's talk about
some lippy
I have been loving gotta be honest I
gotta be honest I haven't been wearing
that many lippies I can share with you
today because as some of you guys have
noticed a lot of you guys have noticed I
have been wearing lippies the I may or
may not be working on so I've been
really testing out things behind the
scenes that I cannot talk to you guys
about yet but I have been wearing other
stuff I have been wearing other lippies
this little combo has been delicious
this is the elf matte lip color in the
shade natural I never really loved this
in the past but I haven't I've been
really liking this and this is kind of
like a nude but it has a slight mob
undertone and I've just been pairing it
with the Aquarius lippie pencil from
colour-pop which they're very similar
colors only Aquarius is just a little
bit deeper I'm actually wearing the
Aquarius lip liner right now this is the
only thing I have on my lips right now
and this is like my fifth Aquarius lip
pencil I go through these a lot I keep
them in my purse but I've actually been
wearing it more often just because I've
been wearing the lip glosses a lot and
I've just been using this one underneath
my lip glosses cuz it just goes with so
many different looks it pulls a little
bit more mod on me just because I feel
like my lips are very pigmented and they
kind of have like a reddish purpley
undertone on their own so things tend to
pull a little deeper on me but whenever
I wanted to do this lip but kind of
lighten it up a little bit I've gone in
with natural I love how they look
layered I think it's just like the
perfect nude lip color and these are
pretty good too we're just on their own
you don't need to put a lip liner
underneath these but I just like the
combo of these two and these elf matte
lip colors are so affordable so are
these colourpop lip prints I just I like
this little little affordable combo
however something that's not so a photo
book I gotta say I love this a lot more
than I thought I was gonna love it this
is the Dior Dior Addict lacquer stick
and this one is called three four four
rolling this is kind of like a lip balm
and a lipstick in one there are a ton of
dupes at the drugstore or like products
that have a very similar feel and
formula but I've really really been
liking this one specifically it's a
really pretty peachy nude and this just
looks great on the lips even when my
lips are extremely cat
and gross this just glides right on it I
just love this it's great to just throw
in your purse I always say that but it
is great to just put on your purse and
then apply because it's so easy you
don't need a mirror and I just love this
color during this time of year okay so
there's a lot of construction going on
in my house right now and I know you
hear that so sorry I'm gonna try to get
through this video as fast as I can but
you will probably hear that like I've
mentioned before I've been really into
glosses recently but besides the gloss
that I have been wearing a lot that I
can't talk about yet I have been wearing
these this is the colour-pop ultra
glossy lip in the shade curvy this is
the collab with I love satire and color
pop obviously this cos is delicious it
reminds me so much of my favorite lip
gloss well my second favorite lip gloss
buxom white russian is my favorite but
this one is the groovy lip gloss from
bareMinerals
and even though the formulas are totally
different the color just reminds me so
much of that I think it's so pretty this
looks so good on top of any nude on its
own I just really really love this color
and it's definitely one of the glasses
I've been wearing the most in my
collection I love it and I also really
love Karen she's so sweet and I just I
love this lip gloss
now this gloss is just a simple clear
gloss it's the NYX mica shine lip gloss
in the shade clear I really love these
lip glosses I feel like they don't
really get talked about that much but I
think it's mainly the color selection I
think their colors kind of suck there's
only a few that are really like juicy
and pretty juicy whenever I want to wear
a liquid lipstick but I want it to be
glossy this is what I've been grabbing
because some liquid lipsticks I love the
colors like this happens to me a lot
with new liquid lipsticks sometimes I
want to wear them but I want them to be
a little glossy have a little bit of a
sheen and then I'll just throw this on
and I like this because it's not too
thick it's not like it's like the
perfect amount of gloss when I just want
a little bit of something and this
smells exactly like cherry starbursts
like I like identical it's the same
scent which I know there will be a ton
of people who will think that this gloss
is too strong so definitely smell it
before you buy it but I personally love
that scent cherry starbursts are my
favorite servers I cannot get enough
okay so I really want to mention this
hair
if you guys saw a recent video I did
where I hold a bunch of perfumes I spoke
about the taka taka I don't wanna say
that spoke about these stela hair
fragrance and I have found my new lover
this one is called Juliette that I heard
Rosita Appelbaum speak about this one
and her and I typically like the same
sense and I was like man I don't have
that one but I didn't think based on the
description I didn't think I was gonna
like it but I thought it would give it a
chance and from the moment I sprayed
this in my hair I knew this was the one
I get way more compliments on how my
hair smells with this versus Stella this
stays in my hair all day and like I
can't even I can't even describe the
scent it's floral but so fresh and so
just feminine and pretty it's a very
pretty scent I like to pair it with more
clean scents so that the two scents
don't clash but I love how this makes my
hair smell a lot of people don't believe
in hair fragrances but I personally do
and this one makes my hair smell better
than any other hair perfume I have okay
and then I'm gonna wrap up this video
with this product because this noise is
driving me mad I want to talk about the
smoke and mirror conditioning cleansing
oil from the brand igk I really really
like this I've been using this as my
conditioner every time I wash my hair
it's recommended to use as a cleansing
oil like a conditioning cleansing oil
that you put from root to tip but I
don't use it that way I just use it as a
conditioner probably using it wrong but
I have been loving it as a conditioner
it says it's a dream cocktail of coconut
oil and powerful hydrators perfect for
anyone looking for their healthiest
lengths ever especially with those of
you with color treated hair dry scalps
or unruly curls me a thousand percent
all the way the only thing is I don't
really have a dry scalp so I just use it
as a conditioner and I love it
this really really moisturizes my hair
it's kind of like an in-between product
for me I don't really love conditioner
whenever I use conditioner I always use
a hair mask a hair is just that dry I
need a hair mask every time I wash my
hair and I've said it before but I don't
wash my hair every single day I wash my
hair like twice a week so I use hair
masks like twice a week in place of
conditioner but I've kind of been using
this in place of a hair mask and I find
that it really really could
my hair some of the products from this
brand are very gimmicky but I really
like smoke and mirrors I guess because
it's supposed to be a cleansing oil I
feel like it's really conditioning my
hair without weighing it down or without
getting too greasy okay guys so that
completes this video thank goodness
because I am literally on the verge of a
breakdown with this noise
I've stopped a hundred times while
filming this video but anyway leave me a
comment down below letting me know what
your favorite product wasn't August and
maybe I'll check it out if I have not
already but that completes this video
guys thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
this is the only thing I have on my
mouth on my lips this is the glossy a
wonder no powder
and then
