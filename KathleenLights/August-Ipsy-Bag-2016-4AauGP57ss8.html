Ipsy bag I'm bragging I got back from
Los Angeles and I realized that I had
this in my mailbox and today I'm
actually gonna do things a little bit
differently while I was in LA
one night laying in bed I was looking at
my Ipsy account and I accidentally
totally saw everything that I was
getting in this bag
I usually don't go on the website I let
it be a surprise but I don't know I was
just on the FC site and I just don't
know I just don't know what happened so
since I know what's in my bag I thought
I would do this video a little bit
differently today and apply the products
to my face as I go cuz you guys know and
like these monthly subscription service
things I like to add clips of me trying
on the products but I thought in today's
video I would just do it as I go so I'm
gonna go ahead and open this this is
what the bag looks like this month look
how cute this bag is it's like precious
like I feel like my niece Sophia would
be like obsessed with this mermaid bag I
think I'm gonna give it to her so this
is the cute little card it has Kristin
Dominique on this she looks so pretty
like a little mermaid I love it that's
so cute okay so the first thing in the
bag is actually this guy right here
which is why I don't have mascara on
this is a tart tart iasts lash paint
mascara I actually have this in a
full-size but I've never tried it out so
I guess this is the perfect time to try
this for the first time this is
obviously not a full-size mascara but I
love samples of mascara like I love the
mini mascaras they're just so great to
travel with and they're just like
extremely convenient so I'm going to pop
this on
my breathing is fogging up my mirror now
that I'm applying my scare I might as
well tell you
so I've been watching the show rain um
because I always have to watch a show on
an airplane it gets my mind off of my
extreme fear of being on the airplane so
I've been watching rain and I'm on
episode 15 of season one and I'm like I
don't know it's I don't know if I like
it as much as everyone else does which
makes me really sad and I'm really
interested in it like I keep watching it
I really I do like it but I don't like
Mary with Francis I like Mary with Bosch
and from the way things are going it
doesn't seem that Mary and Bosch will
ever be together it just it doesn't look
good for them it doesn't look good for
mesh it doesn't okay so these are my
lashes with this mascara that looks
awesome I'm gonna apply some to the
other eye now but I don't know the show
isn't wow me right now I really like
Mary and bash together in it that's just
not gonna happen then you know like I
just don't want watchin that mascara is
a little bit clumpy though I will say if
you the more you layer it on the
Colombier it gets but it's not too bad I
actually do really like this mascara
okay so that was the first product I got
in the bag really really love this the
next thing in the bag is this little
pink box and it's from a brand called
dermelect and it is their peptide
infused nail lacquer knit is oh this
isn't really really pretty color
actually I don't have many nail polishes
that look like this I don't know if you
guys have noticed but like purple is the
color I wear the least on my nails but I
do love a purple with a hint of pink
like those are my favorite kinds of
Purple's so I'm sure this would look so
pretty on the nails I'm not going to do
my nails today because I have fresh
paint on my nails but this color is
really really pretty
superior extended wear high-gloss chip
resistant water and detergent resistant
UV protected chip resistant we shall see
intellect we shall
see seems like a nail polish with like
really good ingredients I guess so huh
I'm excited the next thing in the bag is
this guy right here this is the trust
fund Beauty Lib chasm liquid lipstick
mine all my boxes came like smashed so
let's see what color this is actually
didn't see what color it came up okay
okay I like that color it's a pretty
color trust fund Beauty I've never even
heard of this brand this is in the shade
kay bye hey that's funny okay bye I'm
gonna put on Kate
bye not huge on the scent smells a
little bit like it actually smells like
fake makeup like plastic fake makeup
this color is really really pretty well
I really like this I don't like the
scent at all but if this is a good
formula I might be able to just look
past that because this is such a nice
color it actually doesn't feel like a
liquid lipstick at all at least not a
matte liquid lipstick but it doesn't
claim to be matte so it could be just
literally like a liquefied lipstick
super pigmented really creamy feels
really nice and comfortable on the lips
oh I'm curious to see how this formula
wears throughout the day read I don't
like how it tastes or how it smells what
so the next thing in the bag is this
right here and it says Dead Sea wash off
mask with salt and minerals from the
Dead Sea fifteen-minute face and body
therapy deep cleansing mud based formula
for all skin types I love mud masks
especially from like the Dead Sea I have
a couple from the brown secret and Dead
Sea mud masks are actually really really
good so I'm going to assume that this
one is just as good and this is actually
a really good size like it's obviously a
sample packet but it's big look at that
it's like huge and it feels like you get
a lot in here so I'm sure you get a few
uses out of this not just one or two I'm
really excited to try that I might try
later on tonight because I've been
having some skin issues and then the
last thing in the bag is this little
smushed box it says three tone bronzer
by the brand beaut basics never heard of
this round before this is obviously a
not a full-size product this looks more
like an eyeshadow in my opinion like
look at it doesn't that look like an
eyeshadow kind of small but it's a
sample so I understand I just I don't
see myself wearing this as a bronzer
okay so these are the swatches right
here the pink shade is kind of patchy
and chalky when i swatched it the other
two are fine but this pinky not my
favorite I'm gonna be completely honest
with you guys I have so many bronzers in
my collection that I know I won't ever
grab this just by swatching you on the
back of my hand it doesn't feel like the
best quality especially that paint
and I just don't see myself using this
but for the sake of this video I'm gonna
apply a little bit to my face I'm gonna
take this it brush from Ulta tap off the
excess actually that's not the way this
side of my face has the bronzer and this
side doesn't oh my gosh that's actually
not bad at all once you apply it to the
skin not bad not bad it actually is a
really nice shimmery warm bronzer my
liquid lipstick is actually bleeding
around my mouth like it's starting to
feather a little bit which sucks but
with a lip liner I'm sure that won't be
the case I have certain lip products in
my collection that do this and then just
adding a lip liner seals the deal
I'm actually really impressed with this
month's hypsi bag like super super super
super impressed you get 2 full-size
products which is awesome since your ape
sea bag is only $10 a month so it's cool
that you get 2 full-size products this
month or at least I did I'm not sure
what everybody else got in their bag of
this month leave me a comment down below
letting me know what you got in your bag
did you hit your bag this month did you
love it did we get similar things or our
bag is totally different let me know but
yeah that completes
this video guys I will leave everything
down below like the prices and all that
like I always do in my Ipsy video since
if she doesn't include a card I always
have to look it up afterwards so I will
list that below yeah thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
