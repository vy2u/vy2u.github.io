weird good morning
it's Tuesday right now 9:30 in the
morning and I woke up at 6 o'clock in
the morning and I touched my chest and
he was like I have never sweat so much
in my entire life it felt like there was
just water all over my chest
I woke up with like a really bad stomach
ache and I went to the toilet you know
people do in the toilet after stomach
aches but I went back to sleep for about
an hour or so and then I woke up again
with my stomach ache and I don't know if
that's normal but like every time I get
a really bad stomach ache I get the
shivers like the cold sweats and I
believe that's what was happening to me
in the middle of night and uh so
frustrating I know I've been speaking
about like my stomach issues on Twitter
I actually just did an ultrasound like
two days ago of my gallbladder my liver
like the whole my entire area and then
this week I still have to do like a
stool sample like a poopy sample I've
had stomachaches my entire life when I
stopped eating dairy it was like all my
stomachaches went away kind of and I
still don't eat arrey I'm starting to
realize that I cannot eat saucy foods
anymore and I love spaghetti and red
sauce that's like my favorite thing I
love spaghetti and red sauce but I feel
like I do get some stomach pains when I
eat a lot of spaghetti sauce um so I
feel a little bit better now and I'm
actually about doing my nails
my bare nails right now I'm actually
gonna pick a color I actually don't know
what color I'm gonna do but I have to do
my nails I have to iron my hair it's
like puffy I'm frizzy right now I
thought maybe we could do a random
rambles today if you don't mind Danny
actually left today to play golf with my
sister's husband so I want to get a lot
of my editing done and I wanted to show
you the room because I'm in the process
that that's not gonna stay like that I
have this fake little tree in front of a
frame that that's not staying like that
so I'm in the process of fixing my room
I just spent the last couple days really
decluttering this place got rid of so
many things and it wasn't like just make
up it was just crap I had in here I'm
doing this to my entire house actually
I'm just getting rid of so many things
I'm obviously not throwing them away I'm
donating a lot of them and sending them
to Goodwill and stuff but there is
something about the cluttering that just
like lifts your mood
I mean feeling like
I was in a make-up rut are like a beauty
right I didn't really want to hang out
in this room it was just so cluttered in
such a mess I made a rolls like if I
haven't touched something in a year I'm
getting rid of it and I feel so much
better I feel like a weight has lifted
off my shoulders I don't even know how
to explain it but I promise you it has
changed my mood I was feeling really
down these past couple days and seeing
everything not empty but just so simple
it's incredible but anyway before I do
my nails I just want to show you the
situation this is not gonna look like
that you need to remember all the frames
I have here on the wall and there's
little frames and they were scattered
everywhere I took them off and obviously
I have to lift this one up a little bit
more but I just put them on the wall
from now like where the other hooks
already were just to see more or less
like the vision I had I got rid of my
desk let me turn you around I got rid of
my desk I had an Ikea desk it was that
big white one and I had a lot of storage
and I started to realize honestly that I
was just shoving crap into those drawers
and it was pointless storage it was just
junk so I wanted a desk that didn't have
so much storage so I got this desk from
Pier one and then I changed the knobs so
they can match the knobs on my vanity
here you know so things look nice and
cohesive I'm trying to like incorporate
my white vanity with like the wooden
look because I will never get rid of
that vanity Dannie built it for me
but I'm over the white I am like over it
I don't wanna see white furniture
anymore except for my vanity it that's
different that's different
also this chair obviously doesn't match
with this desk anymore but I really love
that chair and it was a spin see I don't
want to get rid of it so I think I'm
just gonna stain the legs like sand it
down stain like so it matches this desk
or I don't know I figure it out and then
over here I have you know like my cat's
corner I just got this little table I
don't know where I want to put it yet
and I want to put some frames here this
is like my youtube wall this like thing
is covering that but YouTube sent me
this photo and if you look closely these
are all comments you guys have left me
in my videos isn't that so sweet and
it's crazy because I remember these
comments like I was reading over this
and I was like oh my god I remember
reading these comments I thought this
was so cute and it's like something
about me and my subscribers so I love
that I had the picture of me Manny and
Patrick up there but I'm gonna move this
frame over to the side a little bit and
then
put the one of me Manny and Patrick up
somewhere else here I don't know but I
want to decorate the wall more so that
it could be a little bit cuter for my
cat chats and then over here this is the
mess look at this look at this look at
this look at all of this oh this is
clothes I just threw there yeah super
neat
I had these white floating shelves
horrible idea horrible because makeup is
very very heavy so they're like starting
to fall you're like totally bent down so
Danny is actually just gonna build my
shelves all the way across like with
this same style of wood so he can match
my desk and my shelves he's gonna put
wood like all the way across and make it
like really really sturdy so that I can
store all of my makeup here because I
want this cubby to be like all my lip
ease my lip line is my lip sticks and
then this is my bathroom I just recently
did a major declutter in here as well I
got this thing above my toilet off of
Etsy has had my little aloe vera plant
I'm guess I'm giving you a semi room
tour but I keep my little perfumes here
these are my three nephews and this oh
yeah I got my finger if someone can tell
me where this candle is from from my
past videos you have been watching me
from literally the very beginning this
candle is so special to me every time I
smell it it reminds me of the days when
I first started my youtube channel like
I could never get rid of that candle and
then I keep all of my hair perfumes up
here these are all my beauty blenders
and makeup sponges and I have to
declutter these I definitely have to get
rid of like half of these I don't use
half of them so there is no point oh you
feel like this is unnecessary I have my
little elephant here or I put my little
incense I got this at Urban Outfitters
and then I keep my fancy perfumes here
and this is all my sisters Dori you know
that's horrible but I wanted to get a
jewelry box just for Co so I can have
all my Co jewelry in that jewelry box so
I'm just waiting for that to come in
that's why it's like all scattered here
and yeah that's the situation I'm
dealing with right now hey Porter so I
feel like changing things around and
just getting a new setup is really going
to look at my creative juices flowing
because I've just been looking at the
same kind of room and the same kind of
setup since like 2013 you know okay now
to see which nail-polish I'm wearing
this is
Keio polish obviously except that and
I'm actually thinking of wearing
Cassiopeia yes I think I'm in the mood
to rocks with Cassiopeia you know what's
weird is every time I look at this nail
polish rack I remember the day that
Danny built this long time ago we were
still living in Mississippi and I never
ever thought in a million years that I
would be hanging my own brand of nail
polish on that nail polish rack like
what that is so insane like isn't that
so crazy I would have never thought that
in a million years guys anything is
possible
anything is possible if you put your
heart and soul and good intentions
behind it anything is possible
okay so I'm gonna say - I'm gonna do my
nails I'm gonna charge this camera
because the battery is dying
it is so pretty I can't wait for you
guys to see all the new things coming
out in 2018 we are releasing things
other than nail polish this year so I'm
very very excited about it
and yeah after I do my hair I'm gonna
show you my palettes I want to get rid
of all my little palettes and just put
all my eyeshadows in like one palette
I mean I'll show you now Cornelius was
just chewing on his leg so hard that he
looked like one of the hyenas from
Relangi look at him look at him he looks
like edy
Oh before I earn my hair I want to show
you guys something I am so sporadic in
this video I'm all over the place I know
I'm sorry but I want to show you what I
want to do my bathroom so my window is
right here let's add some like
holographic rainbow vibes to my bathroom
I found this on Amazon let me show you
it's like this sticker that you put on
your window and it has like the
holographic colors and then when the Sun
shines through your window you have like
a rainbow effect on your entire room and
I'm gonna do that in the bathroom I
think it would be so cute let me see if
I can show you more or less okay so I
just took a little piece off so I can
show you how it's gonna look
do you see the rainbow and that's only
just one little piece of the sticker
this is gonna look so cool
I'm actually gonna have Danny do that
for me tomorrow because I'm scared that
I'm gonna get like bubbles in it and I'm
not gonna do it correctly oh my god
Porter what is up with Lu Yerkes and
having like little man syndrome hmm by
the way thanks to my stomach I now drink
green tea frappuccino x' instead of
coffee okay now I'm gonna iron my hair
hey guys so I spent hours since the last
time I saw you I hired my hair and I put
up a bun so like whatever and then I did
some filming and I did a bunch of
editing so the day got away from me BRB
sorry that was the post man I swear he
knocks really hard on purpose like I
have a major conspiracy theory that guy
hates me like I just have a feeling
alright so I literally sent you on my
fake plant because my arm was hurting so
you are a little crooked you're a little
bit like
but sorry time completely got away from
me today and I didn't blog this is why I
don't blog anymore I'm really really bad
at it and I also have the most
uninteresting life ever oh yes I want to
show you my freaking palette so that I
have these makeup forever cause that's
right
by the way if you see my sweater
completely dirty it's because it is I
love to wipe my makeup swatches on my
sweater because my mom never let me used
to do that as a kid so now as an adult I
do it all the time anyway I have these
makeup everton palettes they're like Z
palette styles you know full of
eyeshadows and they're awesome I love
them there's just a lot of them I have
like ten of them and they take up a lot
of space so I saw that color train
released these freaky monsters I
immediately ran to the co-ed rain
website I bought a ton of things I
bought the new eyeshadow palette I
bought one of the small shadow palettes
and then about three of these and then I
saw Nicole Guerrero talking about it so
what is a difference this is crazy I
know this seems ridiculous because it's
like we're gonna stick this girl like
where are you going to store this but
for me it's just much easier to have
like three of these then ten of these
cuz I'll just put them on my shelf and
yeah they're a little bit large but
whenever I want to travel I'll just pop
one of these out and travel with one of
these actually just got some makeup geek
ones that are completely see-through and
I'll probably use those to travel with
so I might get rid of my makeup river
ones I'll probably keep one and then
give the rest to my friends so this I
think I'm gonna do it this one I already
started on this one I think I'm gonna do
one with all of my favorite eyeshadows
like a long time I'm gonna make one like
my life palette I have makeup geek color
pop morphe anasazi I have a few
different brands in here but I want to
put my all-time faves in this one
palette so I have my go-to and look at
this mirror that's crazy that's amazing
and then I'm gonna use these other two
palettes just to fill them up like with
the rest of my single shadows because I
feel like I don't need a nice
shadows anymore I'm using our palates
but anyway guys I think I'm gonna end
this vlog here I have to edit it and
post it tomorrow morning
oh my gosh before I end this blog hold
off hold up look at this look at it you
are looking at snow falling baby if you
don't want to drain the virgin you have
no idea what this is but if you're a
Jane the virgin fan like me can you
believe the snow falling actually exists
I saw this somewhere on Twitter and I
immediately ran to Amazon and I
purchased it it's so funny they have it
like if she wrote the book like it's
literally written by Jane Gloriana ibn
Laila like that is hope and and look how
beautiful on the first page are you
crying yet are you
I love that I cannot wait to read the
book I was actually really excited when
I saw this you have no idea I love
romance novels it's like my thing
the reason I loved Jane the Virgin so
much the reason I got into the show is
because I relate so much to Jane to that
character in general her Hispanic family
just there's so many things about Jane
there I moved myself and I am obsessed
with writing I love writing stories my
whole life I wanted to be a novelist
like I always used to want to write why
a novels and romance novels and that
that was my thing and I used to take
creative writing classes and I was just
really into that and when I saw that
they actually had a snow falling book I
was like I need to read Jane's book how
am I gonna read my homegirls book so
it's so cute that they actually did this
Thank You Jane the Virgin the people
behind this whoever you are whoever made
this come to life you are amazing even
though I pretty much know exactly how
this book turns out because it is about
her life but I am so excited to read it
and look how putting on the back it says
brilliance moving masterful I laughed I
stopped I even danced the best novel of
the century it's from De La Vina that's
totally something you would say right
anyway check it out on Amazon I am gonna
end this vlog here I'm gonna get
and in this video and I have to wake up
early early in the morning have so many
things to do but anyway thanks for
keeping me company via camera I always
feel like I am hanging out with you guys
when I'm vlogging so I like that part
yes I love you guys goodnight
