a first impressions review slash wear
test situation I know first impressions
aren't always the best but it's always
like 50/50 I feel like a lot of people
love them some people don't I don't know
for me sometimes I prefer like an
in-depth review but sometimes I enjoy
first impressions as well
I mean honestly just depends I love
watching foundation first impressions
and that's what we're doing today I'm
also gonna give you guys a little bit of
a wear test I'm going to come back at
the end of the night to see how this
foundation wore because this is the
brand new Becca ultimate coverage
24-hour foundation I got this giant PR
package in the mail with this foundation
but now I'm starting to believe that
this is the original foundation they
have they just got new packaging like
the one that comes in the matte bottle
is this is this the same foundation am
ia fool am I about to film a video on a
product that is not even new they have
new packaging now it's in a glass bottle
before it was in a plastic bottle I
believe but now it's in a glass bottle
I'm not gonna lie I prefer a plastic
bottle but that's fine I'm just gonna go
with it we're still gonna do this video
maybe you've been wanting to see a
review on this I don't know maybe I just
secretly answered your thoughts
subconsciously you wanted to see this
video as usual I'm gonna apply the
foundation with a brush on one side and
a sponge on one side just to see which
method of application I like better I'm
gonna prime my skin using my Becca first
light priming filter okay so I'm gonna
take this shade of buttercup I was kind
of swatching all of them on the back of
my hand and this one looked closest to
my skin tone
I'm gonna use my nude beauty blender
this thing is so thick and I honestly
don't remember oh I think this might be
too dark for me darn it oh this is like
thick and moosie I don't remember how I
felt about this when it was in the other
packaging in the plastic bottle I don't
think it yeah I used it but I don't
remember how I felt about it I just
remember people with oily skin who
really really liked it so I really kept
away from it but on the sephora website
it says that it has a natural finish so
who knows
it's not that this color is too dark for
me it's just too yellow for me I have a
yellow neutral undertone and sometimes
when affirmation is too yellow I look a
little crazy but ok so that looks pretty
good it feels a little tacky but it
doesn't look too heavy or anything I'm
gonna take another pump I did use one
full pump on that side
okay yeah I could definitely tell that
you need less product when you're using
when you're using a brush
okay so I used weightless product with a
brush the Beautyblender obviously soaks
up a lot of product but I didn't think I
was gonna use so much less wow this
brush really applies the foundation with
as much coverage as possible I don't
know how it does it but it really is a
full coverage brush this is the
cosmetics airbrush full coverage
complexion brush and yes it's full
coverage Oh actually I like how it looks
on both sides I think my nose looks
better on the Beautyblender side but the
rest of my skin looks exactly the same
so I think I would use the brush to
apply it since I do use less product
when I get the same finish the one thing
I will say is that I'm already noticing
you're going into my fine lines I can
tell this is gonna be a foundation that
looks like foundation a couple of hours
oh you know what I can do hold on I can
test out this cover effects high
performance high performance setting
spray that's supposed to make your
makeup last all day I can use this on
half of my face obviously because we're
gonna do a wear test on the foundation
and we want to make sure that nothing
else is affecting its performance but
maybe if I put this on one side of my
face we can see if this makes a
difference at all
and then maybe it'll be kind of
interesting because at least one new
product will be in today's video I'm
gonna go ahead and apply the rest of my
makeup and I will be right back to let
you know what what is on my face wait a
second wait a sec okay so I do want to
try this out and I actually want to try
it on camera I just applied my heart
shape tape concealer and I'm gonna test
out the Marc Jacobs new finish line
perfecting coconut setting powder and
visible finish line setting powder so
this is what it looks like I love the
freakin packaging it has very similar
packaging to my glossy a powder that I
love where it has this stopper so it
makes it really easy and like less messy
so I'm gonna take my shoe vias place
angled little brush right here and I'm
gonna set down my concealer whoa that
made it so mad holy crabs I made that so
mad oh my gosh oh my gosh this is so
smoothing I'm gonna zoom you guys in for
oh I forgot to zoom you guys in to show
you my actual foundation impaled
anyway you can see the foundation on
this side and on this side too it just
says powder underneath my eyes but I
think this powder looks great holy crab
it feels so smooth let me assume you
guys in so I can show you it makes
everything really matte though you can
see the powder here underneath my eyes I
kind of like filled in my pores right
here as opposed to this side oh I need
to take off my mustache don't look at it
I'm gonna look at my nails either as do
my nails Oh soon as this videos over for
a super full coverage foundation I think
it looks pretty good doesn't look too
heavy yet okay I'm gonna set this
under-eye and then do the rest of my
makeup and I'll be right back okay so I
just finished up the rest of my makeup
and I will be back later tonight to give
you guys my final thoughts on this
foundation but I do have a couple things
I want to say the bronzer went on
perfectly smooth no problems over this
foundation I'm using the Marc Jacobs
fantastic bronzer I think it actually
just came back in stock and I think it's
permanent now I'm not sure but I use
this bronzer I didn't put on any blush
but I used my hourglass and be a
metallic strobe lighting palette and I
use this all the time it's one of my
favorite highlights but I did notice on
top of this foundation because it's so
freakin matte the highlight looks a
little weird like it doesn't look like
it's one with the skin like it usually
does I mean it looks highlighted it
looks great like it looks fine but I'm
used to seeing it look a little bit more
dewy this whole foundation combo with
this underneath my eyes just made my
face very matte and I'm just like not
used to it for my eyes I'm using a new
products from dose of colors they just
recently released these block party eyes
shadow there's single eyeshadows but
they pack a punch
they're like glittery goodness creamy
eyeshadows oh my god so amazing I'm
wearing encore all over my lid right now
like this is literally the only thing I
have all over my lid and then I blend it
in the crease and then I have my dream
Street palette on my lower lash line I
have elfish like smudged on my lower
lash line and I have Mooney as my brow
bone and my inner corner highlights and
that's all I did on the eyes and then I
just put on some mascara I'm obsessed
with these I've only used like two of
them and I'm
in love so I'm gonna apply some of this
setting spray on half of my face how do
i what do i use to cover my face let me
just okay so I did notice that this
spray isn't as smooth as the Dewey or
the illuminating one but let's see maybe
it is maybe I'm just crazy ah why did I
you spray that with my eye open
oh it's feeling a little tight
which is just actually what I pictured
happening because it does say it's a
very long wearing formula not in a
drying way or anything I just can tell
that I applied like up kind of setting
spray okay guys so yeah I'm just gonna
go on the rest of my day and I will be
back later to show you guys how it wore
oh hello friends so in that last clip
you saw I had done my makeup and I was
ready to wear it for the entire day and
I did but the rest of the day did not go
as planned needed to the next day this
is actually the next next day so I was
filming the first impressions and the
wear tests on this foundation on Tuesday
and I worked throughout the entire day
but around late afternoon
Danny decided he wanted to watch all the
underworld movies so I was laying on the
couch watching all those movies and I
ended up falling asleep and I didn't
wake up to like 2 o'clock in the morning
to look in the morning and I woke when I
was like um I have to do an update on my
foundation but I was so dead tired that
I knew I couldn't do a full update so
all I did was record what my face looked
like at the end of the night and I'm
gonna insert it in in a minute when I
talk about the foundation but I'm just
explaining what happened I did get a
close-up of my foundation I did in the
night so I give you an update like
around 2:00 a.m. and I completely forgot
to tell you guys when I finished all of
my makeup it was like 2:45 almost 3 p.m.
so 4 5 6 7 8 that's like 11 hours ok it
was on my face for like 11 hours that's
crazy
but after I did my close-up I washed my
face and I was gonna do the update the
very next day and upload it but I felt
so bad all day yesterday I like I could
barely get out of bed I couldn't put
makeup on like I had the worst anxiety
and the worst like stomach aches it was
just a bad bad day yesterday so I
couldn't post my video I'm so sorry so
quickly filming it right now I'm
actually kind of glad that all of that
happened though because this is the
second time I'm wearing the foundation
on my face and I feel like my opinion
has changed just a little bit and today
I used it a completely different way I
kind of have a different opinion now not
that I had a bad opinion first but
anyway so in my favor box I found this
little paper thing and it says one pump
is all you need to effortlessly cover
and when I first put this on my face I
kind of did just like one entire pump on
this side of my face and then half of a
pump on this side and even though it
looks good I started to notice as the
hours went on that it did look really
heavy on my skin and that's definitely
because of how much I applied I 100%
think less is more with this foundation
today when I went to use it I did my I
did my makeup like a few hours ago when
I did my foundation I used this brush I
really took my time to work the
foundation into the skin I used only one
pump for my entire face and that's
really all you need and I was just going
in little by little I was really patting
it in stamping it into the skin making
sure I was really blending it into the
skin it's still full coverage but it
just looks like my skin and it looks a
lot more natural than it did the other
day so definitely work this in working
in good and when you do I think it looks
really really pretty
another thing if you're like me if you
have dry skin and you kind of have like
lines and creepiness and foundation
really loves to sink into those dry
lines you definitely have to hydrate
with this foundation I found that using
a really hydrating product underneath
has really really helped me with the
fine lines like they're not sinking in
as much also I think this foundation
looks absolutely beautiful once you set
it with a setting spray and not the kind
of setting spray I used in the beginning
of the video I'm talking about like a
dewy one I actually use the cover
effects dewy setting spray today to do
my makeup I would I used very little of
it I didn't wet my face like I did last
time
this foundation just pairs really well
with setting sprays it like it just
melts into the skin and it looks awesome
water resistant transfer proof I agree
that this is transfer proof I was
watching all the underworlds on my couch
and I had like my hand on my face the
whole time and you'll see in the
close-up that it didn't really rub off
of my face so it's definitely transfer
proof it claims to be hydrating it's not
super super map to where your skin is
like
but I wouldn't say it's hydrating so
I'll go free and it has a natural finish
if you do blend it in correctly it does
have a natural finish so I mean I would
say my opinion on this foundation is I
like it I think for really glam looks
this is perfect but for day to day it's
not my favorite I prefer something
lighter but it's definitely gonna be
something I do reach for in the future
when I want to really do my face you
know I would give this foundation for me
a be a nice solid B let's talk about the
other products I use so this is the
cover FX high-performance setting spray
I only used it on this side of my face
but I'm gonna show you really quickly
the close-up of my face this is my
foundation at the end of the night I
didn't retouch I didn't do anything
you can totally tell there I'm wearing
foundation but like I said I probably
applied too much and I noticed that the
left side of my face didn't look any
better than the right side I know it's a
high performance setting spray but to me
it looks it looks the same there really
is no difference I don't know if it's
because this foundation is already long
wearing on its own it doesn't need a
long wearing setting spray maybe I'll
put this to the test on top of a
different foundation and we can try it
again because honestly I just really
didn't see a difference the left side of
my face looked exactly the same as my
right side I think this setting spray
might have right out my skin just a
little bit but I don't know I don't want
to make any harsh judgments just yet I
have to use it again also I did notice
at the end of the day that my skin
looked extra dry here like in this area
not dry but it looked extra heavy there
you're not dry heavy like it looked like
I had a lot of makeup on my skin and I
don't know if it's because of this Marc
Jacobs invisible finish line powder I
only use that in this area here and I
feel like it made my skin look pretty
heavy I mean I have to eye skin like
I've said a thousand times and I have to
work with powders and some of them are
tricky and a lot of them don't work for
me and I don't know if this is a powder
that works for me maybe it would be
better for you if you have oily skin
because it did look pretty matte I just
I don't know because today I used the
hourglass veil translucent powder on top
of my concealer and it looked a little
bit more like weight I don't know about
this like I loved it immediately when I
put it on I just have to play around
with it maybe it was like a light
coverage foundation
something a little bit less intense I'll
probably like this more also I know this
is a foundation review but I just want
to tell you what else is on my face I'm
wearing the Physicians Formula butter
bronzer but Make Up For Ever released
these amazing freaking eye lip
everything pencils these are the artist
color pencils and they are multi-use so
you can use these on your eyes and your
waterline on your lips and your eyebrows
wherever you want to use these like you
can use these any where there's so many
colors they even have white snoots
all the way down to like a black and I'm
wearing this color called Universal
earth in my waterline and it went on
super smooth I usually don't like wooden
eyeliners but this went on really really
smooth I also don't typically like
wooden lip liners but I used this one on
my lips today this is the only thing I
have on my lips
it's called completely sepia or
completely sepia sepia I don't know how
you're supposed to say that I always say
sepia I think it's sepia and the formula
on these are really really really creamy
I mean so far so good
so I've got that going on and then happy
brand new
Kat Von D eyebrow products in my brows I
have my nude sticks gel as that Jill is
killer it's the best but underneath that
I have the Kat Von D signature brow
precision precision you know I don't
find that my Miami accent comes out that
much everybody tells me it does but I
really don't feel like I'm that Miami
except when I say the word precision
it's like impossible for me to say
precision pencil and I have the shade
medium brown
I really really like this it's kind of
like a hybrid between those triangle
tips and the regular like pointy tips
it's like around but kind of oval at the
same time and I really like the formula
and went on really nicely and then I
used the dimension powder on top also in
medium brown and I loved it loved it and
then for my eyes today and for my blush
and highlight I'm wearing the new Tarte
Aspen over and I in cheek palette this
is a very very pretty palette the mayor
is amazing I think the packaging is
stunning and these are very just soft
pinky neutral shades it reminds me of
like a bridal palette it's very
very soft but I actually really liked it
when I first got it I was like huh you
know it looks like whatever I have a
bunch of things that look like this but
I really really enjoyed it I'm wearing
my new blush as my blush it's a really
pretty pink I just used it very little
and then I have these eye shadows all
over the eyes and I'm wearing pure soul
as the highlight on my skin and at first
when i swatched this I did not like it
because it does have like glitter in it
but when you put it on the cheeks and
you set your face a second spray it
looks beautiful like it looks blinding
but not overly glittery it's really nice
and I like it
sorry guys that completes this video
this was my first impressions review
kind of not first impressions because I
gave you my second impression so this is
like kind of like a review you know on
the already existing maybe pointless
video Becca ultimate coverage 24 hour

hours but ain't nobody trying to wear
their foundation for 24 hours because I
like to wash my face before I go to but
