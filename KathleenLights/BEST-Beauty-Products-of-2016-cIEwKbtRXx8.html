my yearly favorites I'm so excited to
film this video I do it every year
basically I'm going to be sharing with
you all my favorite makeup products from
2016 whether they launched this year or
they're just things that I started using
this year and I ended up loving them
I've been binge watching these videos I
just think it's so fun to see what
people really love throughout the year
so this video is gonna be a million
years long so I want to jump into it
really quick I'm not sitting at my desk
because my desk is a mess
so I'm sitting on the floor because why
not
I wanted to mention I'm not gonna be
talking about any of my collabs in this
video just because you've heard me talk
about them a hundred times they are my
favorite and they were amazing
experiences in 2016 so that alone was it
was amazing I just don't want to sit
here and flood you with all of my collab
so know that those are my favorites but
I won't be talking about anything I
collabed with but yeah let's begin okay
so I'm gonna start off with my favorite
eye products the first one is probably
no surprise to any of you I mean none of
these are gonna be a surprise to any of
you really but the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion and enigma has been my
favorite primer ever last year I spoke
about the Mac extended eye base and that
was like my ultimate for so long but
after I discovered this one I kind of
like this one more I do think the Mac
one is awesome especially for colour-pop
eyeshadows because it helps them not
transfer to like the top of your eyelid
but doesn't really mask anything on your
eyes and this one in enigma does
everything I wanted to in Prime's my
eyelids but it also gives me a nice even
canvas to work with it completely covers
all the veins and all the redness on my
eyes and I love it for that I never
really loved any of the primer potions
to be honest but this one in enigma is
awesome for eyeshadow palettes I
actually have to to share with you this
one is like in everyone's yearly
favorites but for a great reason it's
amazing this is the Anastacio modern
renaissance palette I have always liked
uh Nastasia palettes but they've never
blown me away this one was one that
really really blew me away
I have used this so much I am so
surprised I haven't hit pan
any of these these are the eyeshadows
I'm wearing on my eyes today I love it
I'm only using this palette I feel like
you get a complete eye look you don't
need anything else and usually I love
palettes that have a black I think every
pilot needs a matte black but this
cypress number shade is such a dark
brown that I'm okay with not having a
black these colors are so fun and so
warm and I feel like a Nastasia kind of
started a trend with this palette after
this palette released I saw so many
companies come out with these pinky
toned eyeshadow palettes I love the red
shades but I also love the really
neutral shades in this palette because I
get an everyday look with just these
four shadows right here they are a soft
eye shadow so they do have a little bit
of kick up when you put your brush in
but I don't find them to have a lot of
fallout honestly this is one of the best
eyeshadow palettes I have ever used
definitely one of the most exciting
launches of the year for me I love this
palette and then the other eyeshadow
palette I want to share with you guys is
another favorite this is the tartlet and
bloom palette it's full of so many
natural and neutral shades that I feel
like you can get so much use out of this
it's perfect for every single day and
when you look at it it just looks like
any other palette but there's something
so special about it
this shade specifically right here in
firecracker is such a beautiful all over
the lid shade this palette has it all it
has a great mirror I love everything
about this is a perfect traveling
palette you have everything you need you
need this palette it's so good I want to
give a shout out to a single eyeshadow
because out of all my single eyeshadows
I have used this one non-stop this year
this is the color pop super shock shadow
in the shade waddles
I don't want to go into too much detail
because I just recently talked about
this in my color pop must-have video but
it's the most beautiful pinky Brown this
color looks so beautiful in your crease
all over your entire lid there's
something about it it has kind of like a
satin finish it looks matte but there's
like a hair of a sheen to it which makes
it so wearable so easy to blend I love
this eyeshadow so much I've used it so
much this year so for eyeliner I really
surprised myself this year because I'm
usually a pen eyeliner girl like my
Jessie's Girl pen eyeliner
the Kat Von D one I usually go for those
kinds of eyeliners but this year I
really really fell in love with the
English L liner in the shade 77 it's
just their matte black it is so creamy
it just glides on your lid you don't
really have to tug too much of your eyes
it applies like a friggin dream it's so
silky so smooth and it dries completely
matte which I prefer a very black matte
liner it's also very very black by the
way it's perfect it's the perfect
eyeliner I know that some people have a
problem with this because it transfers
but it doesn't transfer on me can you
guys take a guess of what my favorite
mascara was in 2016 this is the Kiko
extra sculpt Volume Mascara it's not a
scam wearing on my eyes right now this
is the best mascara I have ever ever
ever used I love it because it's pretty
affordable it's super volumizing it does
give you a lot of length but it's mainly
a volumizing mascara
I love how dramatic it is and I don't
think it clumps up as much as other
volume mascaras can clump the only thing
I don't love about this mascara is that
it dries out very quickly I'll typically
use this for about two and a half months
and then I'll have to buy another one
because it does dry out so that's the
only negative I have to say about this
but besides that it does everything I
want a mascara to do for me so in terms
of pencil eyeliners I think the best
ones are the colour-pop ones they're so
affordable they're about six dollars or
five and they're amazing especially
their colored ones they last forever on
my waterline they glide on so easily
they don't tug they deposit so much
color and one swipe that you don't feel
the need to go over your waterline over
and over again
I love these eyeliners I'm pretty sure
they released about a year ago so I just
I've been using them all year and then
lastly for eyes I want to talk about the
Urban Decay heavy metal liners these are
glitter liners but I don't really use
them as eyeliner I kind of use them as
as glitters I'll mostly use them on my
entire lid to kind of give a glittery
effect to my eyeshadow the ones I use
the most have to be Midnight Cowboy
which is this gold one pan glam rock
which is the silver but I also really
love this one in ACDC because it's still
a color it's purple but it's not like
purple I mean they're all good they're
all so good they just make applying
glitter so
easy because it comes in this sort of
packaging and you just apply it like if
it was eyeliner you don't have to deal
with any mess having glitter fall out of
the packaging there's no fallin on your
face and you don't need a glitter glue
because it's like already in there
you know it's an all-in-one glitter they
also don't burn or sting my eyes I have
some from NYX that I love so much and
they're so beautiful but they do sting
my eyes if I get a little bit too close
if I was using glitter in 2016 it was
most likely these so I don't really have
any brow products to share with you guys
in this video except one because I've
been using the same brow products over
and over again I mean the benefit ones
released in 2016 the precisely my brow
is one that I use all the time but I
also like the new honest hacia one and
there's just so many brands I love in
terms of brow pencils that I really
couldn't narrow it down but the mister
brow room by zhongshi is a game changer
for me this is their clear brow gel I
don't like the tinted one nearly as much
as I like this one it's yuan-chi so it's
so pricy there are a lot of high-end
brands in this video but I didn't want
to mention products unless they were my
true favorites this is the best brow gel
I've ever used the only thing I don't
like is that it kind of gets dirty
because it's clear you can see the
product build up on the inside a little
bit gross but I look past that because
it's so great for feathery brows I love
that trend where your brow hairs are
kind of like bushy and all over the
place I love that this brow gel keeps my
hairs like stuck in place for the entire
day but they don't feel crispy at all I
don't know it's kind of like your
favorite hairspray that keeps a curl but
doesn't make your hair hard yeah that's
the same way I feel about this brow gel
okay so let's discuss my favorite face
products of 2016 I don't have a primer
to share with you guys because I still
use the one that I loved last year the
Too Faced hangover RX is still my
favorite primer but I do have two
foundations to share with you first one
being the hourglass vanish foundation
stick foundation sticks were all the
rage in 2016 so many brands came out
with their own version of a foundation
stick and out of all the ones I tried
the hourglass one is the best it's
honestly one of the best foundations
I've ever used in general
it's the foundation I'm wearing on my
face right now it's so natural but it
covers so much it has full coverage yeah
it's not drying at all it's not cakey it
works really well with my dry skin I
would say it's more for dry skin but I
think even if you had a skin you would
like this I use the shades bisque and
warm ivory I just mix them a little bit
does go a long way I don't even swipe
this on my face I literally just Pat it
on my face and then I go in with a brush
and blend it in coverage is so beautiful
but it leaves your skin looking so
natural the other foundation I want to
talk about isn't necessarily my favorite
foundation of all time but I've used it
so much this year and I just I think
it's so great this is the Urban Decay
all nighter waterproof long wear
foundation it says full coverage matte
finish and oil-free those things I never
thought I would like someone who doesn't
love a matte foundation but this one
doesn't emphasize my dry skin I don't
know I know a lot of people with dry
skin don't like this but I love this
I've had a lot of skin issues with in
the past like five months I felt like
the only foundation that really really
covered up all my bumpy skin on my
redness all my breakouts was this it
makes your skin look flawless I do feel
like I'm wearing foundation when I wear
this like I said it's pretty intense it
lasts the entire day your skin stays
looking flawless and that's what I love
about it because my bumps didn't really
peak through after a couple of hours it
just stayed covered it was definitely an
awesome discovery in 2016 and really
really helped me when my skin wasn't
looking the best okay so I have to
concealer favorites to share with you
the first one I almost don't even want
to mention it because every single
yearly favorites video I've seen
everyone has mentioned this this is the
Tarte shaped tape concealer I'm not
going to go on about it because I've
talked your ear off at this point
this is the best concealer I have ever
used I know it's so overhyped
and it was out of stock for a really
long time but trust me when I tell you
that this is a product that is worth the
hype a hundred percent every concealer
have you need to set it with a powder I
mean I always set this with a powder
don't get me wrong but I feel like I
don't need to it does increase on me
personally there are so many times where
out of the house and I'm like oh my god
I forgot to set my concealer because it
just looks so good it has amazing
coverage full coverage yeah it's so thin
and liquidy that it blends out like
perfectly I always mix the shades
light/medium and fair but recently you
guys told me that Tarte came out with a
bunch of new shades I had no idea I
definitely need to go on the website and
see if I can pick up a few shades for
the best concealers of all time I do
have to give a shout out to this
concealer right here because I have used
it non-stop this year not so much on
camera because this is my like no makeup
makeup concealer this is the glossy a
stretch concealer and I'm in the shade
light I've spoken about it a few times
on my channel but I use this so much
it's a very dewy concealer which I know
sounds like a turn-off for a concealer
but I love that because it just makes my
skin look so fresh and dewy I love this
underneath my eyes I also like it on
blemishes it's an all-around great
concealer it's so easy I just open it
put my finger in there probably not the
best like not the most hygienic
concealer but I just rub my finger in
there I put it underneath my eyes I put
it on my pimples
I'll even apply some of it like
throughout my face and then just blend
it in with a Beauty Blender or a brush I
definitely have to set this it's not
like the shape tape you have to set this
because it is so amoliant but it's so
beautiful I had to give a shout out to
it because it's like I love it the best
powder discovery for me this year was
the RCM a no color powder this is
hands-down my favorite translucent
powder I have a lot of powders that I
really like as like powder foundations
like the Giorgio Armani one the luminous
silk powder foundation is my favorite
powder foundation in the world I totally
should have included that today because
I discovered that in 2016 but I wanted
to narrow it down to one powder anyway
I personally don't get a white flashback
when I take photos with this it's the
only powder I can bake my face with and
not have it look cakey a lot of you guys
with dry skin can relate to this baking
your face with powder if you have dry
skin can go south really quick because
it'll just emphasize all the dry skin
but this one doesn't do that for me I
could totally bake with this and it'll
be okay it sets my concealer beautifully
it'll even set my foundation beautifully
I love
powder and it's so affordable the only
thing that sucks is the freaking
packaging RC ma please please can you
can you put this in a different
packaging friend-to-friend it's just a
little difficult to use I was okay with
it at first but the more I use it the
more I wish it wasn't in like an oregano
bottle you know what I'm saying okay so
let's talk about bronzers and I was so
shocked that I couldn't narrow down my
favourites I have two bronzers and a
contour powder to share with you so this
product is very pricey but I feel like I
hit a gold mine when I discovered this
this is the coven of quan sculpting
powder in the shade light I have their
original sculpting powder which is in
the shade medium it was the only shade
they had but then they released this one
in light and Wow I love it
when you first swatch this it looks so
grey but it is the most natural the most
beautiful contour powder ever last year
in my yearly favorites video I was
raving about the Too Faced cocoa contour
kit which don't get me wrong it's still
my favorite if I had to choose a contour
kit the Too Faced one is the best but
for a specific contour powder as a
single nothing beats this in my opinion
I'm wearing this today I took a brush
and I just put this in the hollows of my
cheeks a little go such a long way if
you use too much it will look muddy I
never use this on its own I always use a
bronzer on top but hmm I love this for
bronzer I have to to share with you the
best bronzer I discovered in 2016 was
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer I
love this way more than I love my
high-end bronzers it's definitely top
five overall it smells like a tropical
vacation it smells exactly like pina
coladas but that's not why I love it
that's just a little reason I have the
shade bronzer they have another one
that's lighter that's called like light
bronzer or something I don't know they
definitely need to expand their range
because this will bronze my skin but it
really won't bronze up like medium to
deep skin tones it's too light so
Physicians Formula needs to come out
with a darker broader bronzer that would
be amazing I love this because I feel
like it's a two in one I feel like it's
a contour but it's also a bronzer it
gives you a nice shadow on your face but
it also warms up the skin at the same
time because it's not too cool and it
also has kind of like a very slight
sheen very slight it just looks so
pretty it's the bronzer I'm wearing all
over my face it's on my forehead it's
all over my face it's such a great
bronzer
it's from the drugstore so good I love
it but I do want to mention the Too
Faced sweethearts bronzer in the shade
sweet tea whenever I want a beautiful
glowy summer bronzer I would always go
for this I used it non-stop when I first
got it I love that you get like two
shades they're both shimmery but it
makes your skin look so bronze warm and
beautiful without looking orange
I hate very very very warm bronzers and
as you can see this one isn't too warm
it's the perfect undertone but the fact
that it has a sheen to it makes it so
stunning I love it oh my god no I have
one more bronzer oh my gosh I'm so sorry
I have one more bronzer but this is a
liquid bronzer this is the cover FX
custom enhancing drops in the shade
sunkissed this is the best liquid
bronzer I have ever used I love it way
more than the NARS one way more than
that dew the hoola by benefit that was
like pure orange don't get me wrong all
of the custom enhancer drops by cover
effects are amazing but the bronzer is
the thing that really stood out to me
out of the entire collection it's the
most natural bronzer it's a liquid so it
just sinks right into the skin and it
looks like your face is naturally bronze
like that and the undertone is beautiful
it has a sheen to it but very very
subtle and it's not orange it has kind
of a neutral undertone I cannot say
enough good things about this I'm
obsessed with this product so for blush
I actually have two favorites I will say
that the NARS blush and Madley is still
my favorite it's still my most used
blush but this year I have discovered
two that I love so so much the first one
being the sleek blush in the shade suede
when I first discovered this it was the
only blush I was putting on my face it's
the blush I'm wearing right now I put
very little of it but it's the most
beautiful peachy salmon nude blush I
love it so much it has such a buttery
texture and it looks stunning on the
face especially when I have a self-tan
going on I love it in the summer I love
it in the spring it's a really great
affordable blush I love it I loved it
and then Tarte added more shades to
their Amazonian clay blush line which
you guys have no idea how excited I was
to see Tarte expand that color range
because since I'm someone who likes
more subtle blushes more natural blushes
I felt like their Amazonian clay line
was very bright very pinky and they
expanded their line with more neutral
colors and oh my gosh I'm so happy they
did portal and my favorite wooden
hands-down is essential it's a very
neutral blush it looks like nothing in
the pan it's just a typical nude blush
but it's such an essential because it
pairs with every single makeup look it's
just a nude blush that I feel everybody
needs in their collection okay so I want
to talk about highlights right now and I
really really really narrowed it down
and I have so many highlights that I
love but this year discovering these two
it was exciting first one being the
essence pure nude highlighter this is
like a three dollar highlight I bought
it at Ulta and I'm so happy I did this
is definitely not a typical highlight
it's not one of those like really
intense beaming glowing highlights this
one is very very natural but on a day to
day basis to be honest I prefer a
highlight like this it looks like a face
powder in the pan but when you apply it
to your face with a brush it just comes
alive it gives you a natural glow but
you can still see the glow it's like a
glow from within I'm wearing this
highlight on my entire face today like
I'm not even kidding I took a big brush
and I put it on my forehead
I put it on my cheeks on my nose on my
chin I put this everywhere because I
felt like my face was a little bit too
matte today so stunning one of the best
highlights I've ever discovered one of
my favorite things I've ever discovered
and it's so affordable a lot of people
tell me like Oh essence that's so cheap
but don't knock it till you try it it's
so good do not judge a make a product by
its price tag okay and then the other
highlight I want to talk about is these
you a powder highlight in the shade
citrine this is the highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now like right
at the tops of my cheekbones the only
thing that totally sucks about these
highlights is that they are incredibly
fragile I've heard so many people talk
about how there's I have shattered and I
feel like my citrine is on the verge of
shattering every time I open it like
more chunks fall out it's really weird
it's so fragile I'm really worried this
is gonna like crumble up any day now I
have traveled with it in the past and it
hasn't broken but now I'm really afraid
to travel with it again because it's
freaky
this formula is so weird like when you
touch it it almost feels wet
to the touch look at that it's
incredible it's so glowy this is
definitely one of those highlights that
it's like wow that's a highlight but in
the most stunning way possible it's not
chunky it's not glittery it's just a
true sheen to the skin I actually took
this with me to California and my friend
Gabby did my makeup for a photo shoot
and she was like oh my gosh I'm gonna
buy this highlight because it's so
amazing I cannot recommend it enough
they came out with two other shades but
honestly I don't even touch those
because I'm just so addicted to this one
I feel like if I sat here and talked
about all my favorite lippies of this
year this video would be 50 minutes long
so I'm just narrowing it down to a few
now I wear my collabs like almost every
day if I'm honest if I'm not filming I'm
wearing point zero or am wearing
Aquarius or Miami fever or one of those
colors but when I'm not wearing those
I'm wearing these and I cannot find my
Tuscany liquid lipstick by Ofra anywhere
I know that that one is like really new
to my collection but honestly it's like
the most stunning liquid lipstick I have
ever discovered and of course I lost it
my favorite liquid lipstick at the
moment totally lost it but the over
liquid lipsticks will forever be in my
opinion my favorite liquid lipsticks
total favorites
I still love liquid lipsticks it's what
I prefer wearing and this one is
actually by Anastasia this is definitely
a favorite discovery of mine in 2016
this is the Ashton liquid lipstick I
love this it's like a nude mixed with a
brown but it has that really beautiful
warm undertone I don't know I love it
it's definitely my favorite Anastacio
liquid lipstick that they've ever come
out with this lipstick has lived in my
purse since I got it I don't think I've
ever spoken about it on my channel this
is the Amazonian butter lipstick by
Tarte
and this is in the shade Park of
Prentice this is the only one I love
out of that whole line it is the most
beautiful glossy nude ever I love it
because it's a lipstick but it has such
an intense buttery sheen since I got it
in the mail I just threw it in my purse
cuz I knew I just knew it's amazing like
I said it does not leave my purse ever
definitely one of my most worn lipsticks
the buxom White Russian lip gloss will
forever be my favorite lip gloss it's
the best I've mentioned a time and time
again I think I even spoke about it last
year but the colourpop lip gloss in the
shade of fairy floss is awesome it's so
beautiful it's definitely my favorite
color pop gloss it reminds me a lot of
White Russian but it's a little bit less
milky it doesn't last as long as my
buxom one but it's such a pretty just
throw in your purse kind of lip gloss
and I've used this non-stop since it
released and then I have two lip liners
I want to share with you one is more so
a formula even though I love this color
these are the Mac Pro Longwear lip
pencils they last forever I wore this
specific color on Christmas Eve this is
he said she said the most beautiful red
lip liner I have ever come across by the
way so beautiful I love this color I
wore this lip liner on Christmas Eve and
it lasted the entire day and I ate a lot
of food a lot and I drank a lot of wine
a lot and it went nowhere because they
prolong wear lip liners stay until you
take them off but I wanted to mention
the Rimmel exaggerate full color lip
liner in natural I don't think I
discovered it this year but I wore it
non-stop this year this is what I'm
wearing on my lips today this lip liner
that's the only thing I'm wearing on my
lips today I love this lip liner because
it's so easy to overdraw your lips I
have a pretty small top lip not that I'm
ashamed of it or anything I don't plan
on enhancing it
at all but it's nice when you can use a
lip liner to make your lips look a
little bit powdery i love how creamy it
is how natural-looking it is it looks so
beautiful under so many nude lipsticks
oh my gosh i forgot to talk about this
oh I completely forgot to mention this
in my highlighter section okay so the
NARS hot sand highlight is one of my
favorite highlights in the entire world
I loved it so much I didn't think I
would because I don't really like NARS
highlights but this one in hot sand is
amazing it was limited edition but I
think they brought it back for a limited
time I just checked the Sephora website
and it's still available it's in a
little duo with Laguna it's a really
pretty pinky sheet it looks so natural
on the tops of your cheekbones but it
looks so beautiful
I have like ten backups when I found out
I was limited edition I bought like five
of these I wish I was kidding I want to
give a shout out to these falsies right
here these are my favorite falsies ever
I don't really talk about falsies that
much because I don't use them that much
but I have been loving
ever since I discovered them I was gonna
wear them today but these are my last
pair and I wanted to show you what they
look like in the box I have to go to
Walgreens and get like a ton of these
it's from the brand kiss which I never
thought that kiss would make such
beautiful falsies but they really do
especially these in the Shea camellias
it's my favorite they have that multi
angle effect to make them look really
natural they're very thin they don't
have that thick band that's like hard to
glue down they're amazing
I have a haircare product that really
stood out in 2016 the Elizabeth and
James Nirvana Black dry shampoo I've
spoken about this a million times but
ever since discovering this dry shampoo
I hate every other dry shampoo I use
there were so many I loved but once I
discovered this I was like where have
you been oh the most oil-absorbing dry
shampoo ever it literally makes your
hair look like you just washed it and
also it smells like the Nirvana black
perfume so it makes your hair smell good
even if you haven't washed it in a few
days I don't know if I spoke about this
in my last year's yearly favorite but
the loving tan deluxe bronzing mousse in
ultra dark is the best self tanner in
the world so whenever I want my skin to
look a little bit more deep and not so
veiny I will apply this and it just
gives me the most beautiful tan ever I
love that it doesn't smell really strong
you look tan but you don't look orange
it has the perfect undertone I love this
so much and then I wanted to mention my
perfume favourite of 2016 which I
thought would be really hard to choose
because I am a perfume hoarder
oh you have no idea I am a perfume
hoarder and they go bad but I heard them
and this one is actually my second
bottle and I bought it this year's my
second bottle this is the Valentino Dona
perfume you guys know that I do this
thing where every time I travel to a new
place I buy a perfume and I wear it the
entire time that I'm there and I won't
wear it for a few weeks so that when I
smelled it again it reminds me of that
vacation and it takes me right back to
that place and I bought the Valentino
Dona perfume to take with me the first
time I went to Vegas and it's the only
perfume they used in Vegas and I was
there for a whole week and then every
time I smelled it after that it took me
right back to
I love Vegas not because it's like Oh
party Vegas but because I don't not
explain it I think it's a beautiful
place I've been through an entire bottle
I use it all the time now because it
will forever remind me of Vegas no
matter what I do it and just remind you
in Vegas but anyway it's a beautiful
scent besides that I have a lot of
favorites but this one is just so unique
every time I wear this I get stopped and
asked like what perfume are you wearing
it lasts a long time on my skin and it
just smells delicious so I had to
mention this is definitely my favorite
perfume discovery in 2016 Plus hello
