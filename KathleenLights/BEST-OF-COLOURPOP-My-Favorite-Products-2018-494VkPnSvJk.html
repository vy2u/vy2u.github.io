such a highly highly highly requested
video I cannot believe it's been a year
since I've done this video I feel like
this is the third year I do this already
today I'm gonna walk you through my
all-time favorite products from
colour-pop my most used products my
must-haves the unique stuff the great
stuff all the things I think everyone
should try out from colour-pop and for
the past couple of months I've been
getting so many messages to do this
video but I thought you know what it's
time I filmed that video it's time I
filming they have released so many new
things since my last best of color
property like it's insane so I want to
talk to you guys all about my favorite
stuff from colour-pop and it's gonna be
a super long video I feel like if I ever
do this video again like next year or
something it's gonna be like three hours
long so there's a lot of stuff and I
have amazing news for you guys
okay so last year when I did this video
I had reached out to colour-pop and I
asked them if I can give my subscribers
like a coupon code because I was
planning on doing this video and it
would be amazing if I could give my
subscribers like a discount on some of
these products and they told me yes so
last year I had a coupon code for you
guys and I called my friend Jordan and I
was like hey I'm doing an update on all
my favorite color pop products do you
think we can do kind of like the same
thing we did last year and they said yes
again which I'm so grateful for because
honestly this doesn't benefit me or
anything this is just for you guys I
wanted you guys to have a coupon code to
where you can buy all of my color pop
must-haves and you can save 20% which is
awesome so if you use the code cathleen
20 you can save 20% on those products
I'm gonna have a link down below and you
can click it it's gonna take you to the
colour-pop website and it's gonna show
you all of my favorites and you can shop
them all in one place and people can say
whatever they want but I truly love
colour-pop mainly because they are an
affordable brand that gives you high
quality makeup and they're cute and
trending they're literally for me like
the perfect brand I've always loved them
since the beginning of time do you guys
remember when I had like two hundred
thousand subscribers and I reviewed the
lippy six those were the only products
colour-pop had on their website
well no they had super shock shadows and
lippie stix and I did a haul and I
reviewed them and it was love at first
sight and it just bloomed from there so
anyway if you want to see all my
must-haves from colour-pop well you came
to the right place okay so I'm gonna
leave the eyes and lip products till the
end I'm gonna go over some of my
favorite face products or some
miscellaneous products here that I want
to mention okay I know you guys at home
are like can you shut up can you start I
hope so first off I have to give a shout
out to the colour-pop no filter
concealer this is like a six or seven
dollar concealer and it's amazing it's
full coverage it looks flawless
underneath the eyes and it doesn't
really crease that badly I'm in the
shade light neutral the only thing I
don't like about these concealers is
that they do get a little bit darker
when you apply them it gets like a shade
deeper once you start blending it out
but it's nothing that really bothers me
just keep that in mind cuz in the bottle
light neutral looks a little bit too
crazy like a little too white for me but
once I apply it and blend it out it is
the perfect color it decides that for
the price the formula is just amazing
there's like over 60 products to mention
so I'm just gonna go through everything
really quickly I'm sorry if I'm talking
really fast but I don't want the video
to be that long all right so when
colour-pop will launch these concealers
last year they also launched a ton of
brushes and I'm not even gonna lie to
you guys I don't use half of the brushes
some of them are a little bit too stiff
for me I'm just not crazy about a lot of
them I'm gonna be honest but these two I
use all the time and I freaking love
this one more than any of them if I had
to choose just one brush for you guys to
get from colour-pop it would be this one
it doesn't have a name on it but I think
they're starting to put the names on the
brushes now but this is the small fluff
brush and this is the perfect
highlighting brush this applies your
highlight so perfectly and so pigmented
ly some highlight brushes are just a
little bit too fluffy this is the
perfect shape the perfect density it
really does apply your highlight in the
most beaming way possible another
favorite of mine if you're looking into
colour-pop brushes i forget what this
one it's called I believe it's the small
shader brush I love this because it's a
nice flat synthetic packing brush there
are ton of brands that do brushes like
this but I like this one because it's
affordable and it's also very stiff I
love you
is to cut my crease and I also love
using this with my color pops super
shock shadows the ones in the little pot
those are best applied with either your
finger or a flat synthetic brush and if
you want to use a brush instead of your
finger this is the brush to use so color
pop has a few brow products I think they
have like two different brow pencils and
while I like those those are not like my
Holy Grail but one brow product I do
think is worth it is the brow boss gel
at first I was a little bit iffy about
this product but the more I used it the
more I fell in love with it and then I
lost it for like a week you guys know I
lose everything I lost him for like
about a week and I really really missed
it and that's what I knew that's what I
knew you guys know my favorite brow gel
is from Givenchy which is like so much
money it's the mr. brow Rome they're
completely different because that one is
clear and this one has more of like a
white creamy consistency which that
threw me off at first but all you have
to do is like tap it in and that light
color goes away but this makes your brow
hairs stand up and like not move for the
entire day I love that feathery brow
look and this gives you feathery brows
like you wouldn't believe
okay so colour-pop also released a ton
of like powder face products powder
bronzers powder blushes powder
highlights and while I really like a lot
of them some of them aren't my absolute
favorite like I'm not even gonna lie I
haven't tried out any of their powder
blushes yet but I have a favorite
pressed powder bronzer and a favorite
pressed powder highlight out of all the
powder bronzers they released
private-party
is my favorite this is what it looks
like I've used this so much I take it
with me a trowel and I feel like this
just goes with everything this has a
little bit of a sheen to it not a
shimmer but definitely it's more of a
glowy bronzer and I love that it's not
too orange like it's a warm bronzer but
it's not Mac give me Sun you know what I
mean it's it really is a great great
like bronzy bronzer and for highlights
out of all their pressed powder
highlights
here kitty-kitty is my favorite one it's
like the most beautiful champagne she
never it's the highlight I'm wearing but
there's dog here so highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now and I love
it because it's not glittery it's not
chunky it's not thick it just looks like
a smooth
sheen on the skin it doesn't emphasize
my texture a lot of their highlights are
a little bit glittery like a little bit
too shimmery for me some people really
like that look that's not really my
thing which is why here kitty-kitty is
like my favorite but no matter what even
though there are highlights in this
palette I honestly don't even touch I
have to mention they give me more
highlighting palette because the shade
bigger and better right here this is one
of my favorite highlights I've ever used
and like not just in the color pop world
I mean in my world it's like a golden
peach but it's not too dark so it's
perfect for my skin tone but I can wear
it when I'm tan or when I'm really
really fair I don't know it's just it's
honestly perfect and it gives you a
beautiful delicious wet sheen like your
skin looks wet and I just had to mention
this because honestly bigger and better
is like the best but colour-pop actually
just released a new highlighting palette
I believe it's called in nude innuendo I
just got it in the mail and I think
that's gonna be my new favorite
highlighting palette of all time none of
them in that palette feel chunkier
glittery at all they're like all shiny I
can't wait to play around with that okay
so color pop also has super shock cheek
products they look just like they're
super shock shadows only they're bigger
and they're for your face
they have blushes and highlights I'm not
sure if they still have the bronzers but
I but I know they have the blushes and
the highlights blushes when it comes to
this formula it's just not my thing I
prefer a powder blush and same goes for
bronzer but highlights they have some of
the most beautiful highlights in this
formula guys it it's an it's unreal
first one being an oldie for sure and
this one is in the shade of wisp if you
have like a medium skin tone I think
even deep skin tones can wear this it's
a really pretty gold but there's just
something to it almost has like a soft
rose undertone but it just looks
stunning on the cheeks and makes your
cheeks look so like bronzed and goddess
like I love this highlight when I'm tan
this looks awesome but my favorite
favorite favorite is definitely
flexitarian this one is insane it's like
so intense if you have very first skin
and you're looking for a beaming
highlight you're gonna freaking love
this one I'm actually wearing it on my
inner corners today like that
tense inner corner highlight is this
really really reflective and not for the
faint of heart now let's talk about my
favorite eye products I first want to
give a huge shout out to these guys
they're the supernova shadows you
honestly need them although I will say
there are a couple in the line that I
think are a little bit too watery and
they need a little bit more building up
these four are amazing and they don't
need any build-up well except this one
first one is called Walk of Fame this
one is a little bit tricky this is the
only one you have to build up a little
bit but I don't mind that because it is
so incredibly cool it has like chunks of
glitter in it and it just looks so cool
all over the lid so just take your look
to a whole nother level
I love Walk of Fame dragon is like that
delicious golden copper chain you cannot
go wrong with this one UFO is one of
their newer ones and out of the three
new ones that they released this one is
my favorite it's a really pretty pinky
copper but it has tiny little blue
glitters like blue and purple glitters
all throughout it and then moonlit is
like my ride-or-die I love this one it's
a really pretty shimmery purple with
like a pink reflect it's so nice
these supernova shadows are where it's
at guys okay so now I want to talk to
you about what fuels my favorite single
shadows color pop has I'm not gonna buy
if you're gonna invest in powder shadows
from colour-pop I say go for an eye
shadow palette the pans are a little bit
smaller but it gives you a chance to try
out the formula and the shades without
spending so much but if you're the type
of person that doesn't like palettes you
grab yourself one of these this is the
it was all a dream
palette from colour-pop these are just
like their empties the palette style
palettes and I love these even though
you can't see through them I just I love
what it's called I have wonderful of
blushes as well so I love this little
palette but anyway I have a ton of
single eyeshadows but I find these to be
my favorite some of these I don't use
all the time but I find them so unique I
wanted to mention them today so I'm
gonna quickly walk you through these I
kind of have like the more warm yellowy
green side and then the
or like mulberry sign but this color and
play-by-play is so cool I'm not sure if
you can see it when I go like this it's
a dual chrome that's yellow-green it
even has a little bit of like a pink in
there I don't know really really
stunning I love paper tiger it looks so
cool all over the lid and then with like
a bold eyeliner I love it if you're
looking for a really beautiful wet
looking gold then I highly recommend
save it for later it looks so pretty all
over the lid this is like the perfect
olive I shadow it's called team captain
and then this one inside line is like
the most unique green because it has
like a dirty golden undertone I don't
know it works really well with other
warm eyes shadows it's not just
straight-up green and then if you're
looking for more mommy tones these are
totally my favorite this is wake up call
when I first got these in the mail I was
using wake up caught in my crease all
the time when I would just like go out
to the movies or like to lunch just a
little bit of wake up caught in my
crease mascara and I was out the door I
loved it I also really really loved come
and get it because it's a really really
beautiful pinky gold duochrome shift
it's so stunning this one is made to
last if you're looking for that perfect
crease color like that perfect mauve
crease color made to last is your girl
this one though if you want a really
unique cool i shadow definitely pick
this one up this is called glass bowl it
is like a purple a silver a blue it is
so reflective it reminds me of those
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows where they
apply like super foiled and wet looking
and last but not least cute alert is the
perfect deep burgundy shade it looks
stunning on the lower lash line it looks
stunning on the outer corners it's like
the perfect deepening eyeshadow when you
don't want to use Brown so I just had to
give a quick little mention to those but
you already know I have to talk about
eyeshadow palettes I want to talk about
these standard palettes first I have
four that are my favorites these are the
ones like they make most often they look
like this there's $16 well except this
one I'll get into it these are worth
every penny depending on what color
scheme you're going for what eye shadows
you like to wear you will find something
you love in their palettes they have a
few more but these four are my favorites
the first one being Dream Street
obviously I feel
with this palette you can get neutral
eyeshadow looks and bold eyeshadow looks
out of this one this gives you like the
best of both worlds everything on my
eyes today is from the dream street
palette and obviously this is a super
bold look but this is my everyday
palette as well I just used a little bit
of these two shades this in the outer
corner and boom I'm out the door perfect
for everyday but perfect for like a
super smoky eye as well but I also
really really love yes please I think
this is like their bestseller if you're
into like that really warm red sunset
type of eye shadow look you need this
one this yellow is so cool and also very
pigmented and I love it one that I feel
like nobody talks about this is one of
my favorites first of all the packaging
I love the packaging on this it just
reminds me of the 90s this is the I
think I love you palette it's just like
the perfect palette when you want to do
neutral and grunge because it has a
bunch of neutral Browns but then it has
a black and it has this really cool like
green gold shade right here and my
favorite thing about this palette is the
fact that they are Browns it's like a
full brown palette yeah but they're not
super warm they give you more of like
dirty grunge runs look to the eye not so
much like coppery and warm and then this
one is awesome especially if you like a
mirror this is the you had me at hello
palette this one is just a little bit
pricier I believe it's $18 versus 16
because you do get a full blown mirror
in here and this is the palette for you
if you're into bobby tones you have a
few warm colors in here as well you have
like a few Browns but it's mainly like a
mauve tone palette so if you're into
that you are really gonna love this one
as well and then I also wanted to
mention these two this is the all I see
is magic palette I know it came out for
the holidays but it's still available
they have another palette very similar
to this that has the same setup but it's
just like full-on glitter and while I
really like that palette I think this
one is just a little bit better because
it has a mixture of like glittery shades
that then it also has mattes and satin
finishes I feel like you get a lot in
this palette like a bunch of different
textures and I really really like that
and I feel like you have highlight
shades deep shades lid shades it's it's
just really good and then this one is
more of like my honorable mention but I
did want to talk about it because one
you get full-size I thought
this is the semi-precious eyeshadow
palette but honestly I'm just talking
about it for this bad boy right here
this red eyeshadow is my favorite and
not just because of the color but
because like look at this look at this
I'm not giving you guys two swatches on
the eyeshadow palettes because we'd be
here for like a million years and I'm
not just watching every single shadow in
each palette but this shade right here
is like a delicious reddish orange color
like it's red but it has a little bit of
like an orange undertone that looks
stunning all over your lid if you have
like hazel eyes or blue eyes or green
eyes I think the whole palette is worth
it for these three shades this one the
red one and this one right here I mean
honestly I'm so pigmented and I love
that red shade so I just had to mention
that path so you actually just came out
with a new eyeshadow palette I think
it's called give it to me straight
that one looks like a new favorite of
mine so you guys know I've mentioned the
color pop eyeliners in several of my
videos they've made it to my yearly
favorites like two years in a row I
think if you're looking for eyeliners
and you don't want to break the bank
color pop eyeliners are where it's at
you have amazing colors they're so
creamy I just love color pop eyeliners
but my most used are 100% these three
the first one of course is mr. Bing this
is the one I use most often it's a
really pretty brown but it has a very
warm undertone so it just makes any eye
color pop like every time I put this on
my waterline people tell me like wow
your eyes look really green today it's
like never fails every time I wear this
eyeliner so he's my favorite if you're
looking for that perfect nude waterline
honey dude is your guy super creamy
lasts all day and I also really really
love besto this is the color I use when
I want a brown but I don't want it as
light and warm as mr. Bing when I want a
really deep almost like purpley eyeliner
this is the one I go for it has like a
burgundy undertone that's so unique it's
time it's time to talk about an OG
products colour-pop super shock shadows
are some of the best eyeshadows ever
their best ones are the shimmery ones
the ones with glitter the metallic
finishes I think they're better than
their mats but there are some mattes in
here that I
I feel like I cannot live without so I'm
just gonna show you swatches and I'm
just gonna go through the colors like
like water I'm just gonna spit them out
so first we have glow you can get this
in the where the light is quad this is
the perfect brow bone highlight if
you're looking for like a matte
highlight that has a little bit of
something to it cuz it's not like a flat
matte and obviously we have Cornelius I
feel like this one was my go-to crease
shade for so long I never really used a
brush either I would just like put my
finger in there rub it in my crease and
I was good to go I love Cornelius but I
think that this is my favorite this is
like my second models and I'm already
like going through it it's a really
pretty pinky mauve but it has a little
bit of a sheen to it this looks so
pretty on your entire lid like in the
crease and on your lid elixir is that
perfect terracotta eyeshadow just
reminds me of my Miami favorite lipstick
with Oprah but like in a shadow form I
love it this looks awesome in your
crease smudge underneath the lower lash
line this one in Kennedy is one of their
newer ones and I've only used it about
two or three times because I just got it
but I've already used it like two or
three times we're just saying a lot
there's like a little bit of like a
satin Sheen to this that just makes it
so easy to blend on the eyes and it's
such a pretty peachy color and then this
one is also another new one I believe
but I really wanted to mention it
because I used it the other day on my
lower lash line and I got so many
compliments that I had to mention it
it's called don't leave it's a really
really intense pinky purple fuchsia it
is stunning this one is in the shade
mittens this is my third mitten isn't
that crazy the only ones I ever go
through are like the woods I create but
mittens and waddles they're my life this
is my favorite to put underneath my
lower lash line all over my lid mainly
all over the lid it looks so beautiful
it's the perfect base for any eyeshadow
like if you apply this to your entire
lid and then go over it with like a
bronze or like a gold it just makes that
eyeshadow pop so much and then the last
matte super shock shadow I really love
is Central Perk mainly for its name
friends is my life and I love this color
because again it's awesome for the lower
lash line I really like the matte one
mainly to smudge on my lower lashline
because they last on my lower lashline
all day like even more than powder
eyeshadows so I really love Central Perk
and then the rest of these are amazing
glittery shimmery goodness and I'm gonna
try to walk you through these as fast as
I can
the first one being telepathy I think
this is the most unique amazing eye
shadow it looks crazy
on your entire lid it's like black in
the outer corners it's so cool and
really really fun this one is one of the
new ones and I'm obsessed this one is
called the Frog this is like the most
stunning topper like this reminds me of
an eyeshadow topper it has color to it
don't get me wrong but it's more like a
glittery magical like I hate to say it
but like unicorny mermaidy vibe it is so
pretty all over the lid like if you have
an eyeshadow on and then you just apply
some of this on top of your eyeshadow
with your finger it just makes you look
like a shimmering glistening mermaid I
freaking love this one I have to mention
get lucky because it is one of the first
super shock shadows I ever owned
I even have like a full tutorial where I
use this just on my lid it's really
really old I'm still living in
Mississippi this is the most metallic
beautiful gold it's not too yellow it's
not too dull it's like just a stunning
gold I don't know how to explain it
coconut is the prettiest blue eyeshadow
color pop owns out of all the Blues
they've ever released coconut is the one
you need I really want to mention esse
is that how you say this one is si it's
a like it's a look like that's like what
the cool kids say I in my mind I call it
Issa cuz I had a friend in elementary
school her name was Lisa Ella and we
used to color ISA so I call this ISA
this looks so beautiful as a base
underneath your eyeshadow when you want
to do like a blue eyeshadow look or like
a deep purple look this looks stunning
underneath eyes shadow I only used it
once but I loved it out of the base it
looked so good it made my look look ten
times better I've mentioned lightning
bug on my channel before this is the
most amazing copper gold eyeshadow ever
because it's like a copper but it has
like little golden foil flakes all
throughout it it looks insane on the lid
of course weenie it's like my favorite
rose gold eyeshadow if I remember
thinking I'm doing a rose gold look but
leaning more towards like the Rose side
of rolls
golde I always pick up weenie then we
have blaze it's a really pretty cool
toned bronze color has a little bit of
like a green undertone it looks really
pretty all over the lid as like a single
eyeshadow look and then we have
kathleenlights which i can't even
believe I named this that because if I
could describe myself in one eyeshadow
it would be this one if you cut me open
I feel like this is the juice that would
spill out like this would be the color
of my blood and last but not least if
you want a similar color but one that's
even more orange like I would say this
is like an orange with like a golden
undertone this one is called game face
this is an OG for me as well I used to
love game faces so much I don't use it
as much as I used to but I had to
mention it because it's still one of my
all-time favorite color drop shadows
okay guys now we can move on to the
final category which is the largest
category which is lips I am gonna go
through them really fast if you want to
see a certain color like on my lips or
something just pause the video
screenshot it I don't know but I'm gonna
really try to breeze through these so
first and foremost I have to talk about
the original lippie stix still think
these are amazing I know they just
recently launched lipsticks like actual
lipsticks but they're Libby sticks are
so great they're so easy to use because
they're so skinny and they just fit
perfectly like on the mouth I love them
and they have different finishes they
have like chrome finishes matte finishes
and I have six all-time favorites the
first one of course is Aquarius this is
my go-to nude it's my favorite nude
lipstick ever I think I've gone through
like four of these tubes already and
never does me wrong it's for me for my
skin tone it's my perfect nude then of
course we have Lumiere and this color is
so stunning on so many people who love
how it looks on everyone Taurus is also
a really great one if you're into a very
warm Brown it looks so pretty in the
fall time grunge is one of those colors
I feel like does not get enough love it
is such a nice lipstick it's a really
pretty deep color but yet not too bold
it looks so good in the fall and winter
if you want a neon I'm talking like neon
like straight-up neon orange kiki is
your girl I wore this a lot like three
summers ago like non-stop I was loved
this when I was living in Key West it's
like straight up neon orange if you're
into an orange lip you would love it and
then I have to mention Frenchie because
out of all the Reds color pop has ever

I think Frenchie is one of the best
every time I wear Frenchie somebody asks
me what's on my lips like it never fails
Frenchie you do things to me fridgey now
I talk about the ultra glossy lips I
like that they're glossy but they're not
sticky whatsoever they're not the most
long wearing I will tell you that you
will have to reapply throughout the day
but I don't mind I just throw it in my
purse and I'm good to go I just love how
they feel on the lips and I love that I
can wear my hair down and have gloss on
and not feel like it's getting I hate
that feeling the first one I wanna
mention is fairy floss this is the
perfect pale nude gloss I love this I've
used this so much it's one of my
favorite glosses of all time the gloss
that quickly took its place was
moonchild actually have to apply a
little bit more I'm obsessive moonchild
for me it's the perfect nude gloss
that's not too nude because fairy floss
I love it but it can be a little bit too
light this one is like the perfect nude
so I know that color pop released like
ultra metallic lips ones not really my
favorite but this lip gloss in my jam
this is amazing it's not one of their
ultra metallic lips it's an ultra glossy
lip but it's a very shimmery color and
it almost looks metallic
on the lips but in a beautiful beautiful
wearable way my go-to pink gloss though
is definitely Aquarius this one is a
nudey pink but whenever I'm wearing any
type of pink lipstick and I want to
gloss on top I always throw on Aquarius
and then this glass I actually really
love this glass because when I first
started getting into gloss I was wearing
this on top of Lumiere all the time this
one is called Finders Keepers it's like
the perfect mob gloss so before I get
into the Big Kahuna which are the ultra
satin lip before I get into that I do
want to talk about a couple of
traumatically quick if I'm gonna be
honest with you the ultra satin lips are
the way to go but there are some colors
in this ultra matte
formula that I just cannot stay away
from all I have to do is apply a little
bit of lip balm underneath and they're
good to go I have five that I truly
truly love the first one being Aquarius
- I never thought I would like an ultra
matte lip in such a nude color because I
tend to go for darker colors in this
formula but this one in Aquarius 2 is
like the perfect nude with a little bit
a little bit of like a cool mall
undertone every time I wear this color I
get compliments on it you cannot get
this color individually anymore if you
want to get Aquarius - you can only get
it in the Aquarius lip trio like in the
little bundle this next one my sister
actually put me onto this one this one
is called Chi my sister used to talk
about this all the time like she used to
talk my ear off about Chi and it never
really gave it like a full shot until I
wore it one day with like a gloss on top
and I fell in love if you're into
purples like straight-up purples you
will love Lumiere to Lumiere is much
more mauve this one definitely has a
more purple undertone but this looks so
beautiful on deeper skin tones like when
a media wears Lumiere - it looks so nice
on her every time I wear this one I'm
like man I don't know where this more
often it looks so freaking cool I love
this shade and then these two these make
my heart sing especially this one this
is a really pretty
reddish burnt orange this one is called
mama
mama is what my entire family calls me I
actually have the word mama like right
here on this ring that is like my
nickname so I love that this one's
called mama but besides that this color
is so beautiful I cannot get enough of
that color and I feel the same way about
Love Bug this one is similar but it's a
lot deeper and it looks so nice on the
lips it's such a stunning warm
terracotta color and I freaking live for
terracotta shades like it
I'm all about that terracotta life okay
so now let's go through my favorite
settin lips because we have quite a few
if I could only choose one thing from
colour-pop like one product from
colour-pop it would be their ultra satin
lips they're ultra silent lips are my
life so that is why I have so many to
share with you first one being Aquarius
I'm sorry that you guys keep hearing me
talk about all these aquarius's this one
is different than Aquarius too it has
more of a peachy undertone and then
magic wand this was my go-to before I
created Aquarius this one is just a
little bit deeper not as peachy I wore
this non-stop when they first released
ultra silent lips like this was my go-to
then I discovered strip strip is so
beautiful it's also a nude but it has a
little bit of like a brown undertone
that I feel like looks so good with so
many different skin tones I love it
ELISA is the perfect nude pink on me it
looks more pinky but if you have a
little bit of a deeper skin tone it's
like the perfect nude pink it looks so
pretty on so many people I also really
love dreamy and November I'm mentioning
these both because they're both my
collabs I know so I'm trying to get them
out of the way but dreamy is a really
beautiful like burnt salmon color this
looks good on everyone I love this shade
it's a nice way to wear pink without it
screaming pink but if you do like Pink's
November is the one for you it has
almost like a rose undertone it's not
Barbie or bubblegum pink it's like the
perfect kind of pink I love November I
also have to give a huge mention to
freaking frack I wore freaking frack so
freakin much this used to live in my
purse for a long time I don't even know
how to explain this color and I'm not
even gonna try it it just looks so
lovely on the lips I love it
point 0 is a color I guess a lot of
people are afraid of this is my most
used lip product out of like out of all
my lip products I wear point 0 like it's
going out of freakin style whenever I
want to do something that's not nude or
not red but I want it to be bold but not
like too much I go for a point zero and
never does me wrong alright so I have to
talk about cozy this is the most
beautiful neon red ever similar to
Frenchie only even more neon it is so
nice on the lips like this looks
beautiful on deep skin tones in the
summer time and then I have to
this guy of course this is my favorite
red orange to ever exist this one is
called hive and it is beautiful it is
intense and bold and very neon and it's
similar to cosy in the sense that it's
very neon but it's like way more orange
this is my favorite lip color on Amelia
like ever and then last but not least I
have to mention lost I love this
freaking color it looks so beautiful I
actually get a lot of compliments when I
wear lost it's a really nice red without
being too brown or too deep all around a
great red oh my gosh we have gotten to
