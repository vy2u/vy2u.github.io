like a spontaneous video that I decided
to just like sit down and film for you
guys if you follow me on Instagram
snapchat or Twitter then you already
know what I'm gonna talk about so let me
tell you a little story really quick I
have a friend Gabby I'll link her down
below she has a youtube channel she is
like my actual friend in real life I
didn't meet her through YouTube we went
to high school together she's one of my
greatest friends I loved her death so
she is a makeup artist in Miami and she
was always talking about the RCM a no
color powder and I was like now you know
I just bought the Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder that
everybody loves and raves about and it's
really good I love it she's like no this
is better I didn't believe her I didn't
believe I know how it goes with YouTube
hyping things up I was like but I
realized that I do love the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder but
recently I don't know my skin has been
super dry these days and recently I just
find that it's a little bit dry to set
my whole face like I can't set my face
with it and it's been a little bit dry
to even sent my under-eye concealer a
couple months ago it was perfect but my
skin has gotten so dry so I just haven't
been using it so I decided to just take
out B's word for it and by the RCM a no
color powder I bought mine at Namie's
calm but when I went to go search for it
for you guys like I couldn't find it on
the Navy's website anywhere I don't know
if they don't sell it there anymore very
strange this is a three ounce bottle
this bad boy is Hugh pingas and I'm
gonna be demoing this for you guys but
before we get into the demo I do want to
review it and I want to talk about it
really quick so the first time I used
this I was completely hooked I fell in
love this is hands-down 10 times better
than the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder than everybody uses it is
way way better I haven't heard anybody
talk about this except Gaby but if I if
I can recall I think the other youtuber
that I've seen talked about this is
Wayne Goss I think I could be making
that up but I think I remember him
talking about our CMA so like I was
saying the first time I use this I
completely fell in love it's 20 times
better than the Laura Mercier one
especially for someone like me who has
terribly dry skin I was shocked at how
flawless this made my foundation look my
I can see they look everything now I did
get a couple of you guys asking me so oh
you like this underneath your eyes more
than the white shade in your to face
cocoa contour kit and I do but they're
completely different I will use this and
set my under eye concealer and then kind
of like right in this area I will go
over it with the Too Faced light cocoa
because that's a light reflecting powder
kind of really similar to the Anastacio
banana powder or the not really the
banana powder but the mac emphasize
powder kind of kind of has a sheen to it
there's like light reflecting properties
it just makes your under eye look nice
and bright the laura mercier secret
brightening powder that one makes your
under eyes look really bright and
beautiful this is completely transparent
there's no color to this so in terms of
translucent powders this is the best one
although this is not a translucent
powder my friend gabby was explaining it
to me she was saying that translucent
powders even though they're clear you
can't see them on the skin they still
have translucent pigments in them this
is a no color powder there are no
pigments in this whatsoever so she uses
this on everyone like I said she's a
makeup artist and she says that she even
uses this powder on the darkest of skins
like really deep chocolatey beautiful
skin tones she uses this and it's still
transparent I know a lot of you guys who
are darker than me have asked me if this
would work for you and I totally think
it would I just love this so much and I
highly recommend it and not only is it
the best powder ever but it has such a
low price tag this is ten freakin
dollars ten dollars only and there's
three ounces hold on this is the beloved
beautiful I still really like it but
this is the Laura Mercier translucent
loose setting powder this is a $38
primer or a36 primer what no powder and
this has one ounce this has more than
double this has three times the freakin
product and it's a fraction of the cost
ten compared to 36 or 38 you get so much
more and I feel like it's so much better
there's also a 10 ounce tub which I
would see probably would be really good
for like
makeup artist even this though like who
is going to go through this whole powder
I don't know but they even have a 10
ounce tub for $20 which is still less
than that and it's like a million times
more than that one I'm not trying to
knock the laura mercier product at all I
do like it I used it a lot I've spoken
about it on my channel I do really like
it but after trying this I don't see why
I would even go back to that at all I
even bought the little mini Laura
Mercier powder that they have like in
the aisles of Sephora like right before
you check out and I believe it was $22
and it was like this big I would say if
you're someone who watches YouTube
frequently if you fall into the hype
like me I would say wait and don't get
the laura mercier one if you've really
been trying really been wanting to try
it and try the RCM a no color powder try
this one out first if you don't like it
then try the Laura Mercier one but I
really think you might love this because
it's phenomenal this also doesn't give
me any flashback in photography which is
kind of a big deal for a lot of people
especially if you're going to like
parties and events and you're taking a
lot of pictures at nighttime this does
not give me a flashback at all to me the
way I can describe it is it feels even
smoother and even better than those I
don't know if they're called mica or
mica powders those powders will give you
a flashback in photography like the
Ultra HD or like the HD powder from Make
Up For Ever gives me a white cast in
photos this powder is different it's
like magic I don't think it's the same
type of powder because this gives me no
freaking flashback it's fabulous so I
quickly wanted to give you that review
before I went into the video and like
show you guys how I use it and stuff it
really really really is great and I
highly highly highly highly highly
recommend it a lot of you guys have
already been purchasing it on Twitter I
know that it sold out like I spoke about
it on Instagram Twitter and snapchat and
it sold out which is completely crazy I
didn't think it would sell out it's
insane to me
and I want you guys to let me know when
you get in the mail how much like it if
you like it at all
if you love it let me know so yeah if
you want to see how I use this and just
like a chatty little video then just
keep watching so in my other house I
always had like a little table sitting
in front of me where I did tutorials and
stuff but Danny thought that
was garbage and he was thrown away in
his defense it looked like garbage
it was so beat up and staying from me it
was bad so now I gotta go get another
one anyway I'm just gonna go ahead and
get started the only thing I have on my
face is my eyebrows I use the Anastasia
Beverly Hills new brow definer and
chocolate it's a little bit dark um and
they're a little bit bold I know I know
but I really have been loving this brow
definer I've been using it over my brow
is because I find that this isn't a
review video of this but it's just a
talking video I'm just chatting with you
guys I find that I do my eyebrows like
this with this product like a lot faster
than the brow is maybe it's because the
tip is fatter but I don't know I love it
so I have that on my eyes on my brows
and then the only thing I have on my
face is Foundation and I'm using the
newest Tila aqua glow serum foundation I
bought mine on Sephora I have mine in
the shade light it's extremely freakin
dewy as you can see but it's like a
little bit heavy for me because my skin
is doing really really bad right now in
terms of like dryness it's the driest
it's been in a long time I've really
been neglecting my skincare because of
the whole moving process it's been
really dry this kind of caked up a
little bit in between my eyebrows and
around my nose but I love the doing this
so I don't know I have to play with this
a little bit more so I wanted to show
you the process of like the rest of my
makeup as in putting on concealer and
then setting that because that is the
point of this video so I'm going to take
my pixie umm correction No
yes correction concentrate in
brightening peach because my dark
circles have been a little wild these
days and since I don't have my table no
don't be doing that don't be doing that
my under eyes have been so dry which is
kind of good for this video so you can
see how this powder doesn't even
emphasize
my dryness at all okay so the concealer
I'm going to be applying is the Rimmel
wake me up anti fatigue effect and
radiant glow concealer I got mine on
Amazon because we don't have the Rimmel
wake me up line in the States but I've
always wanted to try it so I found it on
Amazon I have mine in the shade very
fair / light which isn't very fair okay
because this is like only a little bit
lighter than my skin tone I'm actually
going to take a little bit of my Urban
Decay Naked skin weightless concealer in
the shade fair neutral just to brighten
up my under eyes a little bit
looks like a hell lot of stuff on but I
don't I'm gonna take my pure cosmetic
sponge and just blend every teeny I have
been liking this bunch over my beauty
blender which is so weird because in my
eyes nothing beats the Beauty Blender
the only thing that has come close to it
is my Real Techniques complexion sponge
but I have been liking this sponge so
much because I feel like it is a mixture
of the Real Techniques and the Beauty
Blender like mixed in one what I don't
like about the Real Techniques sponge is
that it has like a pointy tip because it
has this flat side but then it has a
pointy tip on the other side and I find
that I can't like oh you guys don't care
okay so once I've done that I'm gonna go
in with the reason I'm even making this
video and it is the RCM a no color
powder I'm gonna go ahead and set my
under eye concealer with this fabulous
freaking powder my under eyes don't look
as good as they usually do I haven't
used my eye cream and oil so I just like
to like sift it make sure it gets to the
cap and then open it and use it like
this cuz some of it just sits right
there in the cap and that's how I like
to use it I'm gonna take this Sigma high
cheekbone highlighter fo3 because I
can't find my Real Techniques setting
brush anywhere and it's my favorite
brush for spedde
so I didn't bake my undereyes or
anything because I I never really do I
never really do that baking thing but I
don't know if you can see it mattified
my undereyes really really nicely but it
does not look dry or cakey whatsoever
and it was completely colorless like
there's no color here I didn't make my
under eyes like brighter or more stark
or anything like that I feel like it's
something that you can really see more
in person but it's undetectable it's
like I don't have anything on my face
I'm going to go ahead and set this I
really quick and I'll be right back okay
so I've already sent my under-eye
concealer now I'm going to show you I'm
going to set the rest of my face with
this powder and for those of you who are
extremely dry like me I know it's really
difficult to find a powder that works
for dry skin I rarely ever set my entire
face if you look back on tutorials I
only set the places where I put
concealer and kind of leave the rest of
my face just now with that being said I
do think that this would still work for
oily skin it's so fabulous so I'm just
going to go ahead and set the rest of my
face and then I'm just going to bring
you in so you can see that my skin
doesn't look cakey now I did say earlier
that this foundation was kind of sitting
heavy on my skin so around my nose and
in between my forehead that cakiness
that you might see right now has nothing
to do with this powder
so I don't know if you can tell my face
I'm like I side up when my skin gets
really really really really dry I get
rashes on my cheeks right here at the
bottom so that is what you see right
here is like the rash of my skin but
normally with my skin being this dry as
it is currently I can't wear any powder
whatsoever none none and this one works
for me it's crazy my skin doesn't feel
cakey it feels like I'm not wearing
powder my skin can breathe it's it's
amazing okay so really quickly I'm going
to go ahead and put on the rest of my
makeup and I'll be back to show you like
the whole baking thing okay so I just
finished the rest of my face makeup
really quickly I'm gonna tell you what's
on zip is I contoured my face using the
morphe 9c palette I've been loving this
for contouring
I use my matte breath I used this super
like ashy color to contour and then I
kind of mixed it with this one so it
wasn't too ashy
and then I used my Kiko flawless fusion
bronzer this one is in the shade 0-3
cinnamon I believe it doesn't say
cinnamon but online when I checked it's
at cinnamon and I just use this to kind
of warm up my skin a little bit a little
bit I said that weird and then I use the
new like Holy Grail product I've been
obsessed with this I got this at Ulta
this is the Mallee effortless airbrush
duo it has a highlight and a blush in
this okay this is a huge statement but I
love this highlight so much more than
laura geller gilded honey so much more
than the anastacio so Hollywood and so
much more than Mac oh darling it's that
same formula with that same finish but
it's a million times better I don't know
how to explain its what's on my face
right now it's so amazing and then I
also have this blush on my cheeks this
is called the pure light highlighter and
this is called the effortless peach
blush on my eyes I only have mascara and
I used my Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara and then for my lips I have on
the colour-pop Lumiere lip liner
and then on top I have the anastacio lip
gloss in butterscotch I know that has
nothing to do with this video but just
in case you were wondering what was on
my face okay so now I want to show you
like um kind of like the baking
technique sometimes not always sometimes
if I'm doing something like on New
Year's Eve or like a really special
occasion or a special event I will do
the baking thing right here to sharpen
up my contour a little bit to bake I do
have to open it up though to get more
product out but it's not messy at all
you just literally grab it like that
like it's not messy it's not too full
too when you open this product it's like
powder everywhere
make sure that when you're doing this
you don't have your fancy outfit on you
okay so I'm going to leave that on for a
few minutes and then I will be right
back
okay so because my lighting is really
shitty right now I don't know if you
guys could even tell that it really just
cleaned up my contour I made it look a
little bit sharper but it doesn't leave
this part of your face like stark white
which I found that some powders do so
yeah I love this powder you could even
use this for baking underneath your eyes
I just didn't do it today but I'm sure
in future videos I'll show you like how
I bake my under eyes with this
I never bake my under eyes because I
have dry skin but for the sake of a
video I'll do that so yeah that
completes this video I know that this
was sold out on Beauty luscom this three
ounce one they do have the 10 ounce on
beauty alert
I was just recommending this one because
it's so inexpensive when that comes back
in stock I will link it down below if it
is already back in stock I will link it
below but I will try to find this I
think camera-ready cosmetics also has it
I will try to find this product in stock
currently and I will link it below if
you are interested in purchasing so yes
that completes this video thank you guys
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
