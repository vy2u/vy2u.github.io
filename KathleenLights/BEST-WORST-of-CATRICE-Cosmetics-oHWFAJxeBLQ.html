the start of a new series here on my
channel I've done similar videos like
this in the past but we are calling this
the best and worst of blank there are a
ton of videos like this on the internet
a ton of people already who videos like
this but I thought it would be a fun
series to start here on my channel and
basically I will be taking one makeup
brand and showing you my favorite
products from that brand and my least
favorite product from that brand and
today that brand is Catrice cosmetics we
are going to be talking about the best
of countries and the worst of Catrice
now before I said just video please keep
in mind these are just my opinion
we all like different products for
different reasons these are just my
favorite and my least favorites from
this brand you can find this brand at
Ulta at least that's where I purchase
most of my Catrice makeup so it does get
sent to me but most of the country's
items I own I've purchased myself
they're so inexpensive like one of the
cheapest brand that also for sure and
they have surprisingly really good
product like there are some hidden gems
Catrice makes and you're going to be
discussing some of them today and we're
also going to be discussing some of the
stuff that's enough of it so feel free
to leave the next brand you want me to
do down below I want to do like
drugstore high-end restaurants but I'm
thinking I'm going to do urban decay
next or maybe tart let me know would you
want to see urban decay or tart next let
me know ok so I have a lot of products
to share with you guys like a lot of
products I didn't realize how much
patrice mega buy owned but i got a lot
of stuff so i'm going to try this breeze
to do everything quickly but well of
course i'm gonna start off on a good
note i'm going to tell you all my
favorite Catrice products and I'm not
gonna lie there are some product from
this brand that I don't necessarily find
good or bad they're kind of like the in
between products and I won't be talking
about those today and I'm actually happy
to inform you that the Love pile is a
lot bigger than the dislike pile Patrice
is just pretty friggin good not going
away I'm going to start with my absolute
favorite Catrice item ever this is the
liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer it is waterproof and it is
amazing
I forgot about this concealer a few
times on my channel a lot of times maybe
it's just so good its high coverage like
extreme extreme coverage but it's very
liquid
and it's so easy to blend every time I
apply this concealer no matter what
foundation I'm wearing underneath it
just sinks right into the foundation
looks flawless on the skin never cakey
never too sick it's just literally
beautiful especially for the coverage I
have mine in the shade light beige the
only negative to this product is that it
smells so strong and not in a dramatic
way like Oh Kathleen everything smells
strong for you no no no no this is
strong the sense even lingers on your
face for a little bit I don't stop
smelling it until I'm completely done
with my makeup but it doesn't break me
out the smell goes away eventually and
it's so good that honestly I look past
that since we spoke about concealer I
might as well talk about some foundation
I don't remember if I purchase this on
the Ulta website or on Amazon this is
the HD liquid coverage foundation this
is actually the product that inspired me
to do Catrice first because I honestly
was really impressed with this and I
didn't think I was going to like it
because it says it's mattifying but it
does say it has a second skin effect and
alas up to 24 hours and I really really
like this those lasts all day on my skin
I've only worn it about four times but I
love it each time the first time I put
it on I didn't love it you guys not have
very dry skin and it is one of those
like serum foundations it has a dropper
it's very liquidy and I felt that it
looks just a hair too dry on my skin but
I quickly realized that this foundation
is awesome to mix with just adding a
little bit of moisturizer to this
foundation really makes a difference on
my skin I find it gives me a more
natural finish as opposed to something
more matte it has awesome coverage as
well I would say it has medium to full
it's not really tacky on your skin you
don't have to set this if you don't want
to today I'm actually wearing it with
this guy dropped in this is the Tarte
rainforest of the sea radiance drops and
mix them together and it's what I'm
wearing on my face today and let me tell
you the combo of these two is absolutely
beautiful I really really like this and
I highly recommend it as well the prime
and fine mattifying powder is one of
those powders that I thought I was
really going to hate but ended up loving
the more I used it in the shade
transparent and it is waterproof so it's
perfect if you are looking for that I
haven't tested that out yet
actually I've been saying this for a
while but I want to do a whole
waterproof tested makeup video where I
jump into my mom's pool to see if
anything is waterproof but I haven't
tested if it is waterproof like I
haven't sweat with this on or anything
like that but whenever I feel like my
skin is looking a little bit too dewy
like I took it too far
with the setting spray with the liquid
highlights when I feel like I've taken
it too far I always pull this out and
just pop this in my t-zone and it
mattifies but it doesn't look cakey and
it doesn't look too dry on my skin I
even used this today to set my under eye
concealer and it worked perfectly fine
it's not a powder that you touch and
automatically think like oh this is
powdery this is dry it almost feels a
little creamy so creamy but feel so
smooth and soft and I find myself using
this a lot more than I thought I would I
love these so much these are the prime
and fine
professional contouring palettes I find
that I really like a lot of the things
from their prime and fine range this is
the one I use most often because this
one is just a little bit too deep for me
this one is an ashy radiance it comes
with a contour powder and a highlighting
powder that has a little bit of a sheen
a little shimmer this is a great powder
to contour with a contour with it today
it is very ashy though so keep that in
mind I just use this only to contour
with it it's not the kind of bronzer I
set all over my face it's just simply to
carve out the cheek and I feel like it
does a really really good job the
undertone it's perfect if you're fair
and I just find it so easy to work with
and I actually really like this part to
this little highlighting shade this is
actually what I use to highlight my face
today it's not my ideal highlight it's
not the first thing I reach for but it
is usable at least on me if you're a
little bit deeper than me it's going to
be way too pearly for you but if you're
my skin tone or lighter you're going to
love this shade it's very subtle though
it looks very very very natural on the
skin and hey some people are looking for
that and this gives that to you I even
put on a little bit of this sunny
sympathy I use a bit of this bronzer on
my face today just to give a little bit
more warmth because I don't have like a
Catrice a bronzer so I just use this and
I don't love the highlight in this one
but besides that no contouring palettes
have really good formulas now while
there are some eyeshadows from Catrice I
absolutely do not like and you'll see
later on
amazing single eyeshadows some of you
might have heard of these in the past
these are the liquid metal eyeshadows
and my favorite way to use these or if
they use them wet some eyeshadows get a
little funky if you wet them I find that
these don't get all weird when you wet
them like I spray my brush with fix+ I
go in with this and it looks so oiled
and so metallic on the lid these are
absolutely beautiful especially for the
price and they can get really really
really intense like really intense
depending on how you apply them these
are good stuff but I recently discovered
these and these are just crazy good
these are the glam fusion powder two gel
eyeshadows I have four of them with me
today these are the strangest feeling I
saw okay let me show you this this one
broke so I have to like squish it back
into place and yeah it like lets you
squish it back into place they don't
feel powdery at all they feel they do
feel like a gel they feel almost like a
cream eyeshadow but they don't apply
like a cream they apply like an ice like
a powder I it's the weirdest thing
they are crazy pigmented the only thing
is disease break easily which the same
goes for the other ones they are very
fragile I feel like the trees has very
fragile eyeshadow but anyway this one I
use a few times this one is in the shade
instaglam it is a really gorgeous like
silver taupe lavender these are not like
your typical eyeshadows so they don't
apply best with brushes I find the best
way to use this is straight up with your
finger because product doesn't really
come off on the brush at all the first
time I try to use this I try to use a
brush and it just nothing was coming off
but when you use your finger you get
like crazy fool pigmentation and they're
really stunning something I never
thought I would like these are the long
lasting brow definers and the only other
brand I've seen really something like
this actually online
a couple brands have really something is
this the Kat Von D has something really
similar this where it's for your brows
but it kind of looks like a liquid liner
like a brush tip liquid liner and it
even swatches it swatches like a
prosthetic version of a liquid liner
it's not as intense but that's exactly
how you need them for your brows I never
thought I would be into something like
this but I actually really like these
these were sent to me like four days ago
so I've only used them twice but the two
times that I've used them I
really like these and I like using them
after I'm completely done filling in my
brows like today I use the dark one
which I'm in the know where I put it I
have like a dark brown shade
I was completely done filling in my
brows and then I just went over it with
this and I created like brush strokes in
my brow and it made it look even thicker
I made my brows look even bushier like I
had a lot more hair like it looked like
hair strokes hair hair it looks good
that's all I'm saying it looks really
good I really like these okay so these
last little bits in the best subsection
of this video are lip products Katrice
makes some really really great lip
products some are like okay which I have
any food in this video and there's only
one lip product that I tried that I
don't like that one what later but let's
talk about my favorites these are the
matte lip artists these are so good they
claim to last six hours and I find that
to be the case I really do I love these
they're like those chubby crayon things
this one's the one I'm wearing on my
lips right now this one is called uh
okay so like the names are not on the
actual packaging but I think this one's
called like rosebud something I'm not
sure but I'm wearing like the bright red
the red I mean I have so many Reds in my
collection which is why I don't use it
that often but it's so good these are
pretty matte you can tell on my lips but
they're not uncomfortable to wear
they're very hydrating not like
incredibly moisturizing but you can rub
your lips together they don't feel like
a liquid lipstick they do incredibly
comfortable yeah at the same time it
feels like they're in place you know I
feel that they're not going to slip and
slide the formula feels perfectly intact
without sucking the life out of your
lips and I really really love that about
them I also really love their ultimate
color lipsticks they have ones called
ultimate stay lipsticks that I don't
love as much or not in this video
because I don't hate them I just I don't
care for them as much as I care for the
ultimate colors these give you so much
pigmentation like one swipe full color
on your lips but they feel really nice
they're very moisturizing they're very
comfortable they're really creamy it's
not something that's going to slip or
slide everywhere but it's not matte by
any means it's just like a traditional
lipstick that gives you amazing coverage
and just feel
nice on the lips like sometimes
traditional lipsticks are nice and I
love that they don't settle in my lines
they don't take up on the inside like
they don't get weird there's just really
great lipsticks I love the packaging
they feel very luxurious like this
packaging is really nice and then one
more lipstick I really just wanted to
mention because I love it so much I've
only used one I don't know if any of the
other ones are good but this is their
luminous lip and this is a shade coffee
and cream I love this you can't tell but
I've already used this like a hundred
times
I keep this in my purse and it's a very
sheer lipstick it does give you color
like the name suggests it's like a
luminous color kind of gives you like a
soft wash of color but your lips looks
so juicy it has like a lip gloss mixed
in with like a regular lipstick I love
this and I love this color
coffee and cream is so beautiful okay so
those are my top picks from Catrice
cosmetics I love all of those products
now let's talk about some products I
don't necessarily recommend from Catrice
the first one being this this is their
sands nudes eyeshadow palette and this
is literally awfully not much
pigmentation I mean it's swatch a bowl
like it comes off on your finger but
trying to use this on your eyes and like
impossible
they feel really chalky they do not feel
anything like the other eyeshadows I
spoke about we have a very very dry
texture and I find them so hard to work
with they don't come off Agnes it on the
eyes the only one that when I put it on
my eyes I was like ah this was not too
bad was this one here at the end but the
rest were just pretty
I hate save a pretty garbage I just I
was not feeling this at all it was just
not good
another major disappointment for me was
also a palette this is their Deluxe glow
a highlighter palette and this is what
it looks like it comes with three shades
here on the inside I think I spoke about
this in a disappointing products video I
think it could have been something from
essence sometimes the two brands look
similar to me and I get confused but
this is the glorious three ups the name
of it and this is not glorious this is
none good Jesus Gaga you do good
pigmentation off on your fingers but
it's the strangest thing because these
are pretty matte there's not much glow
to them if anything these are like a
satin finish the only one that has like
an ounce of glow is this first one
because there are
some glittery shimmers in there but the
rest are just sold though like this
palette is sold though and even though
it is so inexpensive it is not worth it
do not spend your money on this because
there is not much lower you're going to
get from this you have to build it up a
lot and then once you do that it just
looks so powdery on the skin and they
don't feel like dry it's just not good
like the same it's like a nothing
Milo it's not what we I like it's not
even a natural glow we highlight it's
like nothing so let's talk about a prime
and fine product I did no like this is
the smokey effects a shadow base the
idea of this is really cool because it's
supposed to be for smokey looks so it's
like this really cool charcoal gray
color but like let me just let me show
you what happens here like okay you put
this on your lid and then you try to
blend it out to create a smoky look
but like
what is this this is the weirdest
oiliest eyeshadow primer ever I don't
see how this would prime the eyes not
even a little bit I attempted to use
this once but when you apply this onto
your eye and blend it out it is just so
strange that I just wiped it away and I
didn't even use it it blends out into
literally nothing you can't even keep
that color on your lid so if you bought
this to put underneath a black eyeshadow
for example to make it more intense or
to put it underneath like dark smoky
colors to intensify as it was like
that's not going to work because when
you start to blend it out it like goes
away if they it blends out into this
like greasy nothing it's great it's a
greasy gray nothing ok so I want to
mention these these are leather the
product I was telling you I don't really
like these are their velvet matte lip
creams I was really really excited to
try these and I'm not gonna lie I like
this one so I mean I can't even mention
this one but this one is in the shade
mid news season and because it's a very
light color I do like this one but I'm
just talking about the darker colors
like pre all the darker colors this one
is called slumming bird this is supposed
to be matte but it's like not and
honestly if it was labeled something
else if it was just labeled like lip
cream without the matte there I'll be
like okay maybe but when you apply this
to your lips you can wait minutes and
minutes and minutes and it does not dry
down Matt it stays with like this creamy
consistency that just never really truly
dries and I know if that's why they put
like velvet it's supposed to be like a
velvet matte feeling but I don't even
feel it velvet to me like a velvet matte
is like the colour-pop satin lips
because those eventually dry matte but
it is like velvet this is just like it
stays creamy they just slip and slide
everywhere and while I don't mind that
for colors like this I don't like that
in my dark liquid lipsticks I don't like
this formula I really don't if you're
looking for a liquid lipstick at the
drugstore I recommend what and while do
they have really good ones but this
Catrice one I would get the chubby stick
that's actually matte instead of this
okay so we only have two more
disappointing Catrice products to talk
about this is one of them this is the
all-around contouring palette and I
gotta say I don't like it I like the
idea of it reminds me of
those make up forevers pallets but this
one I explain this feeling it feels very
thick but it also feels kind of greasy
when you try to use this on your face do
not try to use this on top of foundation
it will just slide your foundation all
over the place it picks up the products
on your knee and just moves it around
and it doesn't look good it doesn't look
seamless it doesn't look smooth it makes
your contour look a bit patchy and just
does it's not what I'm looking for
personally I like a smooth canto I just
don't like the formula and I like the
colors I think the color selection and
this palette is awesome these cream
colors are supposed to be like for
highlighting these are all right there a
little drawing they live a little cakey
on my skin but they're okay and
surprisingly this one is not bad either
actually do like the highlight shade in
this palette I just I'm not I'm not
gonna and I wanted to love you because I
love Catrice but like okay so the last
product is a concealer stick and to be
fair I have really dry skin this might
work for you if you have oily skin but
this is the all-around cover stick and I
have mine in the shade nude I love the
idea of six concealers so much but I
have yet to find a stick concealer that
I truly like love I don't like this on
my skin it just accentuates all the
texture on my skin and all the dryness I
tried using this underneath the eye and
on blemishes as well I surprisingly
prefer it underneath the eyes as opposed
to putting it on top of blemishes
because every time I tried to put this
on top of a blemish and make si blemish
look a little strange and kind of like
it has like a weird concealer film on
top of it but it doesn't really cover it
it just kind of looks cakey I know
really strange but the weird thing is
that it swatches so nicely on the skin
like on the back of my hand but when I
tried to put it on my face my dry skin
on my face just did not work with this
so yeah not loving that one well yeah I
hate that I like finish this on a sour
note there were only a few products I
really didn't like from Catrice most of
the country's items I've tried I ended
up really liking I really love this
brand regardless of those little
products at the end and those are my
opinions but yeah that completes this
video I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video
Oh like a black eyeshadow to make it huh
this is the liquid camouflage high
coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
