a humongous huge huge huge drugstore
haul I don't know if I've ever done a
truck storehouses big well maybe
recently it's like every single
drugstore brand it's just like pooping
out products left and right there have
been so many new releases at the
drugstore I just did a video there just
say that little flap thing I need to do
arms more look at this I'm a weekly I
just did a video where I reviewed all of
the new wet and wild products and that
was a video all in itself and then I
realized that so many brands somebody
runs a new stuff and I have lost a ton
of it and I'm not going to go mad about
it because this for my channel it's for
review purposes just for you guys
I throw money so I can tell you guys
what's good and what's not we have a
system you and I there are a lot of
things that I haven't even tried out yet
the majority of this stuff I have tried
out so I'll give you like quick little
reviews I'll run through these products
as fast as I can
and then I'm sure I will update you guys
on these products and shoot your videos
okay I'm going to tip into it because I
mean most of my purchases came from old
SOCOM at least an order online I got
stuff from Ulta but I also got stuff
from Walgreens calm and I actually
purchased things from the essence
website I also bought all of the Milani
stuff from the Milani website basically
I just went on like all the dog stores
shopping sites online and I got some
stuff okay
okay so I'm going to go ahead and start
with Milani because they have so many
new releases so I purchased a few of
their liquid lipsticks and now they're
not in my box I feel like it's Porter I
feel like any day now I'm going to find
a secret stash of all my stuff but
anyway when those turn out I mean I'm
sure I'll talk about them but let's get
into it okay so Milani released a brand
new setting spray I got so excited when
I saw this this is being make it last
setting spray prime and correct and set
and it's supposed to make your makeup
last for 16 hours now I just use this
for the first time today when I was done
doing my makeup and I think I loved it I
know it sounds crazy but I really do
think I love it it made the makeup on my
face just set so nicely it took away
that powdery look it's just made my skin
look so pretty it made my makeup one
with my skin I don't know I really like
this I don't know if it makes my makeup
last any longer but I will continue to
play with this throughout the week it
doesn't have a strong scent I mean I
applied a lot of this I do want to
emphasize that I applied a lot to my
face that was a spring for a long time
because this spray on this is so nice a
lot of setting sprays from the drugstore
just spray like crazy and like base
their squirty and stuff this one has a
great little mist and even though the
scent kind of threw me off I really like
it so far
that's not what I like I didn't like so
much this is the little Ani okay the
next few products are all from Milani
this is their face and I stroke palette
in the shade sunlight and I don't hate
this but I don't really like this
there's like glittery particles in it I
mean I applied this vanilla shade on my
cheekbones yesterday and it looked
pretty but I didn't I wasn't wowed by it
like I was wowed by something else I'm
going to show you so it's a little
average for me I do think that this
would be great as eyeshadows I have to
play with this a little more I do think
there's potential but right off the bat
it's not my favorite new release from
Milani this however run don't walk run
you need these in your life there's like
four shades but I picked up two of them
these are their new instant glow powders
Milani came out with the most beautiful
freaking highlights ever I love these so
much this one is a really pretty gold
shade I don't like this one as much as I
like this one but this one will be great
for medium skin tones it's in the shade
day glow it's a really pretty subtle
goals I will say that these highlights
are much better applied to the face when
you swatch them they look like nothing
special but on the face it's like a
whole nother ballgame and this one is my
favorite this one is in the shade
afterglow and it is a beautiful pink
iridescent this is the highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now
it is so strobing and highlighting I'm
actually wearing a cream highlight
underneath but I didn't apply too much
of that cream highlight it is so
beautiful it's not chunky and it
actually shows up on the skin like it
reminds me so much as a high-end
highlighter these are definitely worth
checking out the next product I want to
talk about I'm kind of on the fence
about I don't know if I like these or if
I hate these these are the contour
highlight cream and liquid duos I have
two shades I got one Ferriss last night
and I got two light flash natural bear
contour sticks they look like this
they're like little bullets that you
just like twist up and paint them on
your face and then on the other side is
where you have the liquid highlight so
it comes out like this and you just
apply to your face like that now
I haven't played around with these to
give you guys a definite answer but the
one time that I did use it I used fair
light it was a little bit hard to blend
like I drew it on my cheek and when I
tried to blend it out it kind of lifted
my foundation that was underneath I
noticed that things started to look
splotchy and it just didn't blend well
into my skin now I could have been the
foundation I was using I don't know what
the deal is I do have to play around
with it a little bit more to give you my
final thoughts but so far I don't really
like this I don't I don't think I'm
going to like it to be honest and the
liquid illuminator is really really
pretty I haven't applied it to my cheeks
yet I have to play around with these a
little bit more but so far it's like
money came out with a new concealers
that I think I really really like I
haven't opened this one yet but this is
their retouch any race light lifting
concealer I have been using the shade
fair and I think that's exactly what it
is it's a light lifting concealer I have
it underneath my eyes today and I don't
know if it's just the shade it did such
a beautiful job of highlighting the face
really pretty it doesn't have full
coverage I guess I'm so used to the
shape tape that I forget that not every
concealer is extreme coverage I didn't
cover my dark circles completely but I
feel like it covered enough and it just
looks so fresh underneath the eyes I
also like the fact that the cap and I
read this spongy thing at the end
I don't know how hygienic that is but I
like the fact that the cap goes right
into the little hole right here there's
like a little stick in the cut I'm not
making sense but I like the fact that it
has a little stick going into the hole
that means that there's not going to be
any spillage of the products like it's
not going to goop out and get everywhere
anyway I really really really like this
next up is the Milani prime light face
priming strobing and pore minimizing
primer oil free and I really like this
as well I've only used it one time and
you feel like you made my skin look nice
and dewy and for an illuminating primer
at the drugstore I think it's really
good
it has a very natural Sheen to it and it
doesn't look overly doing I don't think
it minimizes my pores I know it says and
I found that my foundation went well on
top like there was no weird stuff it was
good good friend Milani also came out
with this like system here it was on
display at Walgreens okay just I
actually got in store this is like a
whole little system this first one is a
little tube that says keep it clean long
wear lip color remover a really good way
to get your liquid lipstick off I
these kinds of products I haven't tried
it yet but it feels like a lip balm like
a little Vaseline II removed long wear
and matte lip color hydrating and
soothing gentle yet effective it has
grapeseed oil and conditioners so can't
wait to try that out and then they came
out with a sugar lip scrub and a sugar
lip treatment so this is just a little
should uh listen that smells phenomenal
oh my god have smells exquisite very
delicious I haven't tested this out but
you know I feel like I might like it it
has a little bit of like an oily texture
mixed in with the sugar the scent is
amazing though like I would repurchase
it without even drying it because it
sounds so good and then the last thing
is the lip treatment which is what I'm
most excited for I love wearing lip
treatment for I before bed and hopefully
it doesn't smell so good and it goes oh
yeah it feels really thin like it
doesn't feel like it's a very thick
moisturizer but can't wait to try that
fingers smells so good okay anyway so
the last modeling product I got is a
powder this is the greps set and glow
illuminating transparent powder they
have one that looks just like this in
the same packaging but it's not an
illuminating one it's like a mattifying
version this is what I used today to set
my entire face and I really really like
this yesterday when I tried it I hated
it because I used it to set my under eye
concealer I thought maybe it would be
like the perfect like illuminating
under-eye powder but no I do not like
this to set my under eyes at all it made
my under eyes look really creepy and
wrinkly and not not good but when I went
to set my face today thinking it was
going to be horrible and powdery and
cakey no I love it I think it's
beautiful to set the face it kind of
gave my face a very soft glow like very
minimal but I thought it actually looked
really pretty and then this and combo
with this it just it looks it looks good
oh my god okay next brand
let's talk Physicians Formula this
informant has the bulkiest packaging
okay so I have two new blushes when
these released I got so many tweets from
you guys asking me if I thought they
were good or if I knew that these were
Elle and I nearly crapped my pants when
I saw that these were available these
are the new butter blush is now if you
watched my channel you know the
Physicians Formula butter bronzer is my
favorite drugstore brands or everyone
they really
whatever blushes I knew I had to get
them these are so light and I purchased
both of them they only have two shades
these would never be dark enough for
anyone that's deeper than a medium skin
tone is that maybe this will work for
like medium skin tones these are so
light Physicians Formula allows the
inner petals they need to start coming
out with shades that reach a bigger
variety I really give you have a deeper
skin tone there's not much from
Physicians Formula you can try out like
look how might these blushes are anyways
if you have medium to light skin tones I
think you would really like these I
personally love these I'm wearing this
color on my cheeks right now I'm not
sure if you can tell they are very soft
blushes they don't give like crazy color
payoff but they're so smooth they're so
creamy they're just like the butter
bronzer this is a shade of Plum Rose
it's a really pretty dusty pinky purple
mauve shade they blend like but up again
my butter blushes and then this one is
the one I wore yesterday and I love it
this one is called natural glow and
that's exactly what it is this is a
beautiful blush topper like if you're
already wearing a blush and you want it
to have like a beautiful peachy natural
glow you just put this on top and it
gives your blush like some light the
packaging is a little bit bulky but it's
so cute images it does smell like a
tropical paradise this is the highlight
and contour palette now they have two
different ones they have a completely
matte one and then they have like a
shimmery one I don't I don't know how I
feel of these I don't like the packaging
it's so bulky but I actually do really
like the product inside I use this matte
creamy shade to set my lids and then I
use the contour color right here is
super Ashley it's very great I used very
little of it I used my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer to bronze my skin
but then I used a little bit of this you
have to have a very light hand with this
because if not it will look muddy it
will be too much I want to use this one
yesterday and while I use way too much
had to take my makeup off and the same
goes for this one these are so pigmented
I used this red shade as an eyeshadow
yesterday and it was stunning so I
shadow do really good but for the face I
don't know if I love it this white shade
right here is so intense use as little
product as you can tap off your brush
like a hundred times and then apply it
to your face because it could be too
much too fast for us and then I think
that these guys they're not new I've
never seen this one before so I don't
know if this one
no probably not but even if they're not
new I want to share them with you
because I think they're really good and
I just open please our depositions for
we let map collection quad eyeshadows
this one is classic news and this one is
quartz quartet I'm wearing the classic
nudes all over my eyes today this light
shade is so pigmented it's perfect to
highlight your brow bone all of these
are really pigmented so creamy so good
so easy to blend and I use quartz
quartet yesterday and the same goes with
this these are more cool tone shadows so
I mainly use like the two more natural
shades but I actually use this dark grey
color in the outer corners just a very
little right here today and I love in
fo-eenix brand so I picked up a
foundation from essence that I was so
excited to try I am so torn I'm so
conflicted whether or not I like this
this is the pure nude makeup natural
finish foundation it says it has a no
makeup feel and I totally agree I'm
wearing this on my face right now I love
everything about this except it oxidizes
so badly so I bought the shade pure sand
and I just want to swatch it for you and
show you how it oxidizes so when I first
blended it out of my face I was like oh
my gosh this color is perfect for me I
love it so the color right there I'm
going to leave that swatch on the back
of my hand so you can see in a little
while how orange it turns so I work
today for the first time and as I
continued on my makeup I noticed on my
face you started getting darker and
darker and then I had to really bronze
up my neck once I have like this on top
it totally tone down the color situation
that was happening so maybe from now on
I just hasn't said it right away I'm not
sure because it leaves the most
beautiful finish on the face like I'm
looking at my skin and I love how it
looks it doesn't look like I'm wearing
foundation at all you don't see the
makeup on my face
it was extremely affordable but it is
oxidized it and I don't know it's
throwing me off I don't want to give up
on it because it's so good so I just
came out with new eyeshadows I believed
in I know because I've never seen them
before and they're called The Velvet
they're single eyeshadows I picked this
to shade I got you better mauve and
taupe secret these are amazing guys I
was blown away when I first watched
these like I just want to show you it on
my finger like look at that look at that
they feel so creamy when you put your
finger in they have the most velvet
formula in the world I guess that's why
they're called the velvet after it maybe
I need all of them like I want
I'm going to go purchase the rest of
them and then I picked up three lipstick
I'm pretty sure these are new they're
called their matte matte matte lipsticks
yes
Matt Matt Matt I love the packaging I
love this like frosted when it shows you
the color of the lipstick I really like
these lipsticks they have a beautiful
matte finish but they don't feel drying
at all I got this really pretty everyday
nude one it's called natural kiss this
amazing amazing matte deep berry shade
this one is stunning and this one's
called purple power and then this last
one is a really pretty trendy Molly lip
you know you know these colors I have
100 of these this one is called perfect
match I'm actually going to be doing I
mean it's going to take me a while to do
my research but I'm going to be doing a
full drugstore dupes for high-end
lipsticks or high-end liquid lipsticks
or high-end lip liner I'm going to do
like a whole lip dupe video so I'm sure
these think something out there you know
okay so NYX recently released a bunch of
new stuff as well and I purchased most
of this off of the NYX website somebody
I got it ultra as well I don't know if
you guys care where I got this stuff but
I always feel like I should tell you
so makes released their own version of a
beauty sponge and this is what it looks
like actually I've never tried this
before
Oh have a little dip in here I had no
idea this looks exactly like my sponge
from the brand pure let me wet it
because I will tell you okay so this is
a sponge wet it totally doubled in size
which is a good sign I wish I would have
used it today I don't know why I did it
but it feels like it's going to be
really good actually have high hopes for
this because it feels very nice
hopefully isn't stuck up too much
product or is hopefully it's not too
stiff huh do you see what I mean look at
this it has like a spot right there that
hasn't dried yet but it's like 10 shades
darker than it was seriously elephants
why did you do that to me look at me so
I haven't tried this out because I got
totally the wrong color but they came
out with total control drop foundation I
couldn't try it because literally I got
look at this color this is the color of
mustard when did I ever think that I'm
gonna fit me this is a shade beige ain't
nothing beige love it next release
liquid highlight these are so reflective
and so beautiful they're stunning
they're very very highlighting they're
really easy to blend like on the back of
your hand but I have
try these on my face yet so I'm not sure
if they sit well on top of foundation or
anything like that but I will definitely
be trying these out and letting you guys
know I got this white shade this one is
called moon glow this gold one is called
crystal glare and this pinky teaching
one is called Moonbeam and I'm so
excited to try those out okay so I am
really impressed with these new products
from NYX these are their full white and
full black eyeliners they have a bunch
in this full white line where they're
all like really creamy and pastel I have
a green one and a pink one and honeydew
and this one in linen really pretty
shades and then I got two of they're so
black just to try out but I want to go
back on the website and buy all of them
this one is like a deep blue and it's
called onyx and then this one is a red
I'm actually wearing this one on my
waterline today it's called oxblood
these are amazing I'm not sure what
these claimed to do but they last so
long on the waterline and they glide
they're creamy buttery so pigmented I'm
actually wearing I don't know if you're
supposed to but I'm actually wearing
Oxford as a lipliner today with a
lipstick on top I'll talk about the
lipstick in a second but I love these
they're so so good so they came up with
new lipsticks and I bought two from the
line they're called the pinup POW
lipsticks and I got this shade right
here in silk I love that it has they
remind me a lot of the NYX round
lipsticks they have like very similar
packaging but I don't think they make
those anymore anyway this one in silk is
a really pretty peachy nude you know I
have 100 like leaves but whatever and
then this one I got I'm actually wearing
this one on my list right now and it's
called resistance and I love the color
only put the eyeliner on the outer
corners and then I filled in my entire
list with this if it's a beautiful berry
shade I love it so much I mean it
transfers a little bit but it stays nice
and matte on the lips a last mix product
I have to talk about is one of their new
duochrome
illuminating powders they came out with
dual chrome highlights which I feel is
like all the rage now so I got this
shade it's like a white shade but it
reflects a really pretty pink color I
haven't tried this on my cheeks yet but
I don't know they feel a little stiff
for me
highlights are one of those things that
you need to put on your face in order to
tell so have to try it all mostly
business in a shade
snow Rose by the way
okay so let's move on to Jordanna I only
got a couple of products from Jordanna
this is the prime no pores pore
perfecting face primer I think I really
like this I use this today
underneath my foundation and I feel like
it just gave me a really nice canvas I
did not see any minimizing on my pores
oh it doesn't have that silicon e
texture that most pore minimizing primer
do it feels more like a moisturizer but
like a very very light moisturizer
nothing too hydrating so I feel like
maybe even if you have oily skin you
might like this because when I applied
it to my face after a few minutes it
sink right into my skin and it left my
skin feeling soft but it didn't feel
like Julie your luminous I have to play
around with it a little bit more but so
far so good I don't know Jordana also
came out with these guys right here this
is the sculpting gold creamy contour
stick and this one is the blow and gol
creamy strobing stick I got two shades
in each I got two of the lightest
glowing ones this one is called pearls
lo zero one it's better for fair skin
and then this one is radiant glow zero
to butter for those of you with like
light to medium skin unfortunately I
have not tried these on my face same
goes with the contour six I was supposed
to use them today so I can give you
myself something but I completely forgot
I got zero one light and zero to medium
be like shade look like it's going to be
a really good color for me the only
thing is that when I'm blending it out
on my hand I'm just afraid it's going to
be patchy on the skin because it doesn't
blend out the best on my hand but again
I have Chinese on my face I might use
the product I haven't used yet like in a
chatty get ready sometime in the near
future okay we're almost done we're
almost done now we have fallen into the
miscellaneous pile random random brands
so Revlon just released these guys are
here you know the Ultra HD lipsticks I
think they're brand new why does that
name sound so familiar these are really
good but I don't think they're
mind-blowing they feel really
moisturizing I got this one this one's
like they're nude it's called sand this
one that's a little bit new but a little
bit more on the brown side this one is
called desert and then this beautiful
this is my favorite one out of all of
them it's such an intense berry shade
this one is called vineyard really good
really pigmented if they do slip and
slide a little bit because they're so
creamy so you might want to use a lip
liner and then
since up because I've heard like three
people rave about this eyeliner already
this is the l'oreal voluminous liner
noir liquid eyeliner i got the shade
rich black and honestly wearing this on
my eyes today because I accidentally
bought two online so this is my backup I
really like this it's pretty black but
it's nice and matte and it applied
really nicely I prefer a brush tip this
one is a felt tip liner I like that it's
long so it's easy to use
I didn't struggle with this at all I
think it is pretty easy to use you might
really like this I think it is one of
the better ones at the drugstore wet and
wild released a mega cushion illuminator
and a mega cushion contour they were all
sold out of the cushion contour at
Walgreens they only had one more of the
illuminators and I couldn't find this on
the one wild website what's up with it I
don't understand that is this like
exclusive to Walgreens I'm not sure but
anyway it is a stunning glowing
highlight it looks really pink when you
look at it you're like oh that's pink
but it's not it's not it gives you a
really beautiful pearly look to the face
I actually have this product underneath
the Milani highlight and before I
highlighted with the Milani I just
applied very little and it gave my skin
such a beautiful fresh look I can't wait
to play around with this more because I
feel like I'm really gonna fall in love
with it okay more lip products l'oreal
released infallible paint i thought they
were going to be exactly like the Too
Faced melted lipsticks they're in very
similar packaging but I was pleasantly
surprised when I open this this is not a
squeezy tube this has a wand how amazing
is that I was so impressed by the
packaging I got two shades nude star
this is my favorite it's such a
beautiful deep rosy nude and then I got
topless which is a really pretty cool
tone greyish purple lamothe color these
are very very pigmented and they still
remind me of the Too Faced melted
lipstick I have to be honest L'Oreal
rarely impressed with me but these was
promising I've only really warned this
one for just a couple of hours and then
I took it off because I want to do
something else I don't know but I have
to test these out further and usually
L'Oreal products smell like disgusting
chemicals but this doesn't smell too bad
I mean the L'Oreal sentence there but
it's very faint as opposed to their
other lip products though okay and then
the last product in this haul is this
bad boy right here this is the
you Maybelline master strobing liquid
and illuminating highlighter this is in
the shade 100 light and this stuff is
intense this is a liquid highlight but
it is very very intense like blinding
intense I cannot wait to use this I
haven't used it yet but it looks really
beautiful swatched
it feels very creamy I picked this up
because I heard nikkietutorials rave
about it in a favorites video so I had
to go out and buy it and I cannot wait
to try this ok guys so that completes
this video oh my gosh it was like a
million years on hopefully I went fast
enough these were products I just
recently purchased online I cannot wait
to play with these products even more I
love testing out portable makeup just as
much as I love to see a high-end makeup
it's like all makeup I love all week so
yes let me know down below if I miss
anything if there's a new drugstore
products you want me to try out a new
ball I will check it out thank you guys
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye because I found
that a lot of new essence because I
found that I would because I found that
not everything what I find I'm like
