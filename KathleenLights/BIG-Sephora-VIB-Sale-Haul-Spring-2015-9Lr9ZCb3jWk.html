a haul and I know I oh I told you guys
in my last like major epic high-end haul
that I was done
hauling high-end makeup and that I was
on a no buy but every year twice a year
Sephora has their huge vib sale which
means that you get 15% off your entire
purchase or like 15% off each item or
whatever and if you go to Sephora often
you know that they never ever have sales
like ever
so when Sephora gives you 15% off you
take advantage of it but time I upload
this video I think the sale will be over
already I'm not exactly sure I just got
my box in the mail I ordered everything
online I just got everything in the mail
and I wasn't gonna film this video to
tomorrow cuz it's pretty late already
but I was like no I want to upload this
tomorrow so yes let's get started
because I have a lot of stuff to share
with you guys and these videos are
always 55 minutes long I got a brand new
makeup rubber face and body foundation I
already have this foundation it's one of
my favorite foundations in the entire
world but I decided to get it in the
shade 20 I have 32 but I could only wear
that when I'm self-tanning and since I'm
not self-tanning at the moment I still
want to wear this foundation when I'm
not so tan so I got it in the shade 20
which I'm wearing it on my face right
now and I love it I've talked about it
before it's sheer coverage but I feel
like it leaves a flawless finish to the
skin it's one of my favorites I'm just
gonna show you the other makeup rubber
products I picked up I got the I got an
aqua Rouge and I have like five of these
aqua Rouge things and I love them
they're like liquid lipsticks better
they're like double-ended one side of
the gloss and one side is like the
liquid lipstick matte formula I never
really wear the gloss on top but a lot
of people love the gloss but I got it in
this color this is in the shade one
because it reminded me of like those
cool toned baiji purple nudes like
cashmere from Lime Crime or whatever
that kind of color and I thought it was
really pretty and I figured that I would
get a lot of use out of this one so I
picked it up it's super long wearing I
love
these another face product I got was the
bareMinerals complexion rescue I felt
like I needed to buy this because I feel
like it screams Kathleen honestly it's a
tinted hydrating gel cream SPF 30 this
is essentially a tinted moisturizer but
it is oil free silicone free paraben
free fragrance free it's good for
sensitive skin um it's a non-chemical
SPF it is also hyper allergenic so it
shouldn't break me out I got mine in the
shade butter cream and I just wanted
something for like day to day when I
don't really want to wear makeup but I
just want to even out my skin tone a bit
I have a feeling I'm really gonna like
this some people don't but I've heard
really good things so far I'm hoping I
like this because I have high hopes for
this honestly so I got a red Beauty
Blender and I don't know why because I
already have my backup my backup Beauty
Blender but listen red is my favorite
color of all time and when I saw that
they had a red Beauty Blender I couldn't
control myself and I was like I need a
red Beauty Blender I just need one it's
red and yeah I took advantage of the
sale and I picked up another little
backup so yeah I'm excited to use it
because I love me some red red Beauty
Blender so I've been hearing a lot of
people talk about these two for a matte
like liquid lipsticks and I know a lot
of people like the short one like the
luster matte ones I think that's what
they're called but then I've heard a lot
of people talk about these as well so I
decided to go with these I picked up two
of them these are the Rouge on a weight
that's French I can't read that
it's a French it's a their cream lip
stains basically cream lip stains and I
got more of a me shade and then like a
springy shade so this one is called
peach tart and it's pretty much just
like a peachy color I really really have
high hopes for this because since it is
like peachy and vibrant I hope it
doesn't give me that weird like
crustiness on the inside of my mouth I
really hope it doesn't do that
and then I got this one in the shade
mandarin muse and this is like a red
orange hand
you guys know how many like lip colors I
have like in the shade like the red
orange shade I don't know they're my
favorite but I wanted to try these two
for once because they are cheap oh it
smells really good they don't smell bad
at all and they are cheaper alternatives
to like Stila stay all day liquid
lipsticks okay so now I'm going to talk
about some high-end makeup that the sale
forced me to buy that if I wasn't under
the influence of this 15% off I probably
wouldn't have popped but I got to
hourglass products and the only
hourglass product I have is the ambient
lighting palette and I also have the
hourglass primer like they're regular
primer that's like an arm and a leg it's
pretty ridiculous so when I saw this
guys I freaked out because everyone
raves about that primer from hourglass
and I feel like sometimes my skin is not
I feel like my skin is a little bit too
dry for that primer I like it but
sometimes I need a lot more hydration
than that offers I decided to pick up
the smaller version this was like
twenty-two dollars and it's like small
but the full size was like fifty bucks
so I was like let me give it a chance
first before I buy the full size but it
is a primer serum hydrating and
anti-aging when I put this on the back
of my hand at Sephora like something
like inside of me just exploded and I
got like all tingly and I was like oh my
god because it literally feels like a
coil and a serum like in one I don't
know it felt like a dry girls dream like
a dry faced dream honestly it has that
serum a texture that I cannot explain
that I'm so excited to use this on my
face I haven't used it on my face yet
but see that glow do you see that glow
and I only put very little this feels
amazing
the other hourglass product I got was
the ambient lighting powder forgot the
name almost in the shade luminous light
this is just like a very very soft
highlight this is the highlight I'm
wearing on my entire face I literally
put this everywhere I was like because
it's very very subtle very very sheer I
can't explain the texture of these
powders to me you get what you pay for
it with this because
these are incredibly expensive think
you're like 40 bucks for one powder but
the formula the texture the way it feels
it's not like it's not out there at all
it's subtle um I would recommend this
for like a bride on her wedding day if
you want a beautiful highlight and I
freaking love it it's like I put a lot
and it's it I love it okay so more
expensive smells Emmy patient boom more
expensive brands so I have never
purchased anything from these two brands
before because des offensive and Hyuna
oh I got a Marc Jacobs lipstick the most
I've ever paid for a lipstick worthy
NARS audacious lipsticks they're like my
favorite they're like sitting right
there I freaking love them they're
amazing but I've heard so many people
rave about these new Marc Jacobs
lipsticks these are the new nudes sheer
lip gels and I saved a couple dollars
with the sale I really love the
packaging some people hate it but I
think it's so cute it's magnetic I'm
really I'm all for it I like it and I
got mine in the shade strange magic and
a lot of people are gonna be like
because this color is like baby pink and
super light like a light baby pink but
mrs. Lowell in talks about it a lot and
she really loves this lipstick so I'm
going to give it a go I purchased it I
probably use it with like a darker nude
lip liner underneath but I actually like
those really light baby pink so I think
they're pretty in the summer and in the
springtime so I got that in strange
magic and then I thought this was a huge
gimmick like when I heard that these
things came out I was like oh they
cannot think of anything else I remember
sitting at home and thinking like why
would anybody purchase that for that
much money it's ridiculous but okay so
this is actually a product that I
purchased in person during the weekend I
walked into Sephora on Sunday and my
lips felt like they were about to fall
off I don't know why but my lips were so
incredibly chapped that like last
weekend I guess because I was traveling
I don't know but they were so bad so
then I walked it to the YSL section just
to window-shop because I never by YSL
product
but I was just looking at all the
beautiful gold packaging and then I saw
these beloved a Tintin oils and I was
like why do people spend 30 bucks on
that that's so stupid
I think they're like 30 bucks but then I
tried one on my lips and then I just
started walking around the store and
immediately my lips felt so amazing so
moisturized so hydrated they're
literally oils it's like an oil for your
lip but it has like a tent I got mine in
the shade peach me love and I love this
and I'm ashamed to love it it's really
just a luxurious oil that has a tint
that you put on your mouth and your lips
feel so so hydrated and hydrated in a
really good way not like a weird dry
chapstick like an oil like it just soaks
into your lips and it also gives a
beautiful color on top of that it's like
a very sheer color like a nice light
wash I'm gonna throw this in my purse
because honestly I can't think of a
better place that it will be I just
think it's perfect for those days it
boys raises your lips and then it gives
just like a little bit of color like on
those days where you're not really
wearing that much makeup so this next
purchase was a hype I found too you know
like when you go into Sephora and you're
like oh my god like a thousand youtubers
talk about that let me buy it that is
why I bought this I bought the benefit
roller lash and this is typically not
the kind of mascara I would ever buy
because one I like volumizing mascaras
and I hear this is lengthening and - I
like the fiber bristles and this is like
rubber but if one more person talks
about Vegas I swear I'm gonna lose it
everyone is talking about this talking
about hug the best mascara ever oh so
good so I purchased it and if I don't
like it I'm coming after every single
youtuber who said it was good I'm coming
after all of them I'm talking to you
deci you're the reason I bought it I
heard really good things about the
cinema secrets makeup brush cleaner so I
got the small size to see if I like it
it's pretty much it just clean your
brush it is like spot cleaning you just
clean your brush and then immediately
it's dry like you spray your brush you
wipe it down and then your brush is like
immediately dry this is great I'm like
in between washes
it's a really good idea a really good
concept especially when you're using
like black eyeshadow and you don't want
your eye brush to like stay stained to
just like go in and spray this and clean
your brushes fast Urban Decay came out
with new moon dust eyes shadow is not
that long ago and I have solstice
because as soon as I saw solstice I was
like if that baby I was going to say
that biatch is mine like it's beautiful
you don't have solstice get it is so
good so then I picked up this one
because this one had really good like
ratings a lot of people really liked it
it's diamond dog and it's pretty much
just like a brown this was not new
though they've had this one for a while
um this is just like a brown with like
little glitters all over it this is what
it looks like so you can see it's like a
brown but then you see like you have
like a silver glitter enos so it's
really cool that it's brown but the
glitters are silvery I don't know I have
feeling I'm gonna like this okay so I
have three more things I'm sorry this
video is so long and I'm really gonna
try my best to cut down my videos from
now on I talk too much I got season
conduct off of elementary school because
I talks too much
so this next purchase was such an not an
impulse buy I was actually thinking
about it for a really long time but it
was such a splurge for me but anyone who
knows me knows that I hate paying 110
dollars for nail polish I just hate it
like formula X nail polishes are my
favorite but they're expensive and I
don't like paying ten bucks for nail
polish when I can get OPI like with my
mom's cosmetology license for like 4
bucks so I hate spending a lot on nail
polish I freaking hate it I have to
deborah lippmann nail polishes which are
like 20 bucks each that I got because I
wanted them so bad and I got them for my
birthday but when I first saw this I was
like wow that's really beautiful but I'm
not paying not much but then I heard so
many people say amazing things that I
was like do I need it and it is the
nails inc duo by Victoria Beckham which
Victoria Beckham is like a goddess to me
like she's so like and I love that like
yeah you're a fierce little mama I
really live Victoria Beckham I mean who
doesn't like it isn't the Spice Girls
hello and nails Inc is a great brand
sell sold a Sephora a suspensive
I don't really buy it but it's a really
great band brand and this is what the
kit or the little duo comes in it's two
nail polishes by Victoria Beckham and
the reason why honestly why I picked it
up is because these are both nail
polishes that I wear constantly like the
colors you get like an orange e red
which you guys know is my favorite kind
of red my favorite kind of orange like
an orange E scarlet red and then a
beautiful nude color right here so this
one is in the shade judo red it's
beautiful so up my alley and then this
one which is the one that everyone was
raving about everyone said it was so
amazing so perfect and it's bamboo white
and you can see the color on the side
and guys this is what I have on my nails
right now and it is the nicest nude I've
ever put on my nail it's like a pinky
nude this is a like literally a bride's
dream in a bottle like on their wedding
day the perfect bridal nail polish I
love the wand it's like a thicker one so
there was no streakiness happening and
you guys know with nail colors like this
color sometimes it could be streaky
sometimes you need more than two coats
no this was the best nude formula I have
ever seen in my life well worth it such
a beautiful color two coats no
streakiness love it I haven't um worn
this one yet and I'm really really
excited this was like 40 bucks okay for
two freaking nail polishes the last two
products I got were also influenced by
youtubers as most of my purchases are
and I got this pure vanilla the healthy
body butter like from from the brand la
vanilla which I've heard really good
things about la vanilla which I've just
never tried anything and Emiliana
recently like called this in a video and
she was saying a story on how se button
had like SS de from the channel se
button she was like spinning or
something and she was sweating like a
pig but then still smelled so good and
it was this so I was like mmm I'm very
intrigued and without even smelling it I
just ordered it online and I'm so glad I
did because it smells so delicious and
it's like
thick delicious instant hydration body
butter and it just it smells so all
natural ingredients and no harsh
chemicals I think I got was influenced
by Holly dolly one to eight which I
don't think that's her name on YouTube
anymore but anyway she was talking about
how this is like the best dry shampoo
dark dry shampoo she had ever tried this
is the Amika pick up dry shampoo now let
me tell you how hard it was for me to
purchase this I go through dry shampoo
like it's going out of style I love dry
shampoo because mama hates to wash her
hair that's just the way that it is and
my holy grail dry shampoo why can I say
that word dry shampoo is from batiste
and batiste is like seven bucks this
sucker was like twenty two dollars and I
think that's pretty ridiculous
for a dry shampoo like this is so
expensive for a dry shampoo why um when
I saw the price I was like but she says
that it's her favorite dry shampoo or
something like that and it had really
really really good reviews online so I'm
very very excited to try this this Amica
dry shampoo better changed my life
because I'm not I'm gonna be very upset
six point seven three fluid ounces and
this has five point three ounces oh so
you're telling me batiste has more I
could have bought like three batiste
with the price I paid for this but I'm
hoping I'm going in with my arms wide
open and I'm hoping it's good yay so
that was everything I picked up at the
VIP sale from Sephora leave me a comment
