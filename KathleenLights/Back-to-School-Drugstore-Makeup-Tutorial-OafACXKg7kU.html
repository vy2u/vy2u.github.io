because I have this I semi done and this
eyebrow done and I'm just like a mess
right now I feel really really tired my
hair is so crazy like this is actually
my hair with no product in it but I
really wanted to film this video so I
didn't have time to do my hair and I
just do a braid on because my bangs were
like out of control and I haven't even
brushed my hair and I'm pretty sure
that's a dreadlock so today I think I'm
going to do a talk through tutorial
because I haven't done one of these in a
long time
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to fill in my eyebrows and I
don't want to do such a crazy bold
eyebrow like I usually do this might
even be too bold for some people but
usually I fill them in a little bit more
bold you know I'm going to use the elf
eyebrow kit for this it's really cheap
it's $3 and it's perfect because you get
a wax and a powder perfect because the
wax keeps your hair in place for a
really long time and usually people go
to school for like eight hours a day so
that's always great I'm just going to
take the wax part first and just run it
through my brows I'm using a little
brush I got at Michaels and it cost me
like two dollars
after that I'm just going to dip it into
the powder and go over it to set the wax
Brow's are completely optional I just
feel like it's a little bit necessary
for me even though in high school I
never filled in my brows never but now I
feel like oh I need to fill in my brows
this video is probably going to turn
into like a chit chat video which I hope
you guys don't mind okay so now I'm
going to move on to my eyes and I'm
going to zoom you in really quick to
prime my eyelid I'm going to be using
this Milani shadow eyes in the shade
almond cream this is a great pencil
because it lasts all day and it does not
crease and it's great because it covers
up all those veins on my eyelids have
crazy veins there so I'm going to take
it pretty far up and then just blend it
out and usually in the morning if you
wake up to go to school really really
early your eyes can be a little bit red
and tired and this just kind of masks
that next I'm going to take a fluffy
brush like this I got this off morphe
brushes calm it was under six dollars
and then I'm going to take this single
eye shadow from Milani and this is
called Bella cappuccino it's just a nice
matte Brown and I'm going to take this
and just dust it in the crease of my eye
so right here right where your eye folds
I'm just going to dust that right here
this is just going to give some depth to
the eye give it a little bit more color
now you don't have to go this far and
actually do your eye makeup in high
school the only thing I want on my eyes
was mascara like all through high school
I did a start wearing makeup till after
so this really is optional but I didn't
want to do a tutorial with just mascara
next I'm going to take another Milani
eyeshadow this one is called Bella
champagne it's a really pretty champagne
color
Bella champagne and I'm going to take
this brush from Ecotools it's just a
dual ended brush I'm taking the shading
part and I'm going to dip it right in
and apply this to the lid this is just
going to add some light to your eyelids
so it's not all flat looking now I'm
going to take this Maybelline eye studio
quad I'm not sure if this was
limited-edition I hope not I got it
pretty recently at my CVS and this is in
taupe tees I don't think it's limited
edition but I'm not exactly sure and I'm
just going to take this light color
right here and I'm just going to dust
this right in the inner corners and this
is going to make your eyes look more
awake it's going to bring light to the
center now I'm going to take this darker
topi shade right here I'm going to dip
my brush in this is a little blending
brush from Ecotools and I'm just going
to dust this right on the outer corners
just a little bit just to give a little
bit more depth but you really don't have
to do this part especially if you're in
a hurry in the morning then I'm just
going to add this light shade again
right here underneath my brow bone just
to make my eyebrow look a little bit
lifted I'm going to quickly move on to
the rest of my face um before I finish
up my eyes and honestly this part is
completely up to you it depends on your
skin type and all that stuff if you want
to go ahead and put on foundation
because that's what you feel comfortable
with then go ahead and put on foundation
you could also use a BB cream it's a
but less coverage and a little bit more
natural BB cream is perfect for you guys
in high school or anything like that I
just like to go ahead and take some
concealer and dab it over the places
where I think I need concealing so I'm
just diving in with a full face of
foundation so I'm going to be using my
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
10 light this is my Holy Grail concealer
it's from the drugstore and it is
fantastic
so I'm going to go ahead and dab it in
between my eyebrows because I have a
birthmark there around my nose I know
I've cited a bunch of times that I have
this crazy weird vein can you see it it
drives me nuts
kind of makes me look like I have a
moustache and then a little bit on my
cheeks because they get some redness on
my cheeks and then I'm just going to
blend this in with my buffing brush from
Real Techniques
I do have some self-tanner on so the
rest of my body is darker than my face
but I will fix that up with some bronzer
okay so once I've done that I'm going to
go ahead and try to hide my dark circles
as best as I can
especially when going to school I know
you guys wake up really really early in
the morning and I remember when I was in
high school my dark circles were on
another level so I'm going to take my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser this is probably one of my
favorite products from the drugstore to
put underneath the eyes it's just really
easy it's an easy application and it
covers pretty well so I'm just gonna dab
that underneath my ass
I don't know if I said it but it's in
the shade I have it in the shade of fair
and then I'm blending that in with my
Real Techniques contour brush
now I have really really dry skin so I
usually do not set the foundation or
concealer on my face unless it's like a
really dewy foundation but this
concealer I don't find that I need to
set it on my face so I'm only going to
set my under eye concealer because if I
don't set that it will crease like crazy
but if you have oily skin I definitely
suggest setting your face with a powder
because you're going to be at school for
a long period of time so you want to
make sure that nothing slips off or you
don't get oily or greasy throughout the
day so I'm just going to go ahead and
set my under eye concealer I am using my
fit me powder in the shade 135 creamy
natural and I'm just going to set that
okay so to finish off my eyes I'm going
to go ahead and take the same Milani
pencil I use to prime and I'm going to
add this to my waterline and what this
is going to do is going to make my eyes
appear larger and more awake it's going
to mask that redness that my waterline
tends to have in the mornings then on my
little smudgy brush I'm going to take
this color we used earlier and I'm going
to run this underneath my lashes
now I'm going to apply some mascara I am
using my Revlon bold lacquer gro
luscious mascara but first I am going to
curl my eyelashes now my eyelash curler
is not from the drugstore but you can go
ahead and use whichever eyelash curler
you own one that I recommend from the
drugstore that seemed to work pretty
well for me was from Revlon so I'm going
to go ahead and curl my lashes and then
add a few coats of this to my top and
bottom lashes and I'll be right back
okay so after I've applied mascara I'm
pretty much done all I'm going to do now
is warm up my face a little bit just to
give my face a little bit more life and
for that I'm going to use my NYC smooth
skin bronzer in the shade sunny this is
what it looks like
so to swirl my brush this is a Real
Techniques blush brush and I'm just
gonna warm up my face I feel like
bronzer is really important either
bronzer or blush because it's just gonna
make you look alive and healthy so if
you don't want to use bronzer then just
add some blush to your cheeks and if you
don't want to use blush then go ahead
and add a little bit of bronzer to your
face um you know I'm the girl who
prefers bronzer over blush personally
that's just me but it's all about
preference and honestly I'm just warming
up my face you don't need to do crazy
contour or anything it's just school you
know it's not ideal okay and now for
lips it really just depends on you I
wore the exact same lipstick in high
school since like my sophomore year I
wore Mac's
pretty please every single day in high
school like that was my signature
lipstick I wore it every day I've gone
through like four tubes of that lipstick
because I wore it every day in high
school but it depends on you I recommend
something lightweight like a lip gloss
or if you want to go ahead and use a
lipstick because it's gonna last longer
throughout the day go ahead and do that
just going to apply my NYX butter gloss
in the shade Eclair
these are great because they're not
sticky and you just throw it in your
purse apply between classes okay so that
is the completed makeup tutorial I
really hope you like this video like I
said you don't have to do all this
honestly this is probably even too much
for me because I was the kind of girl
who woke up very very late I didn't have
time to do all of this actually have a
video that I will link down below on
five easy steps to get a if not flawless
face but to get a well done dressed up
face so it's perfect for those of you
