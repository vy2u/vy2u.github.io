all about makeup sponges like this I
have gotten so many requests to do this
type of video where I talk about the
Beauty Blender and really good dupes are
really good alternatives to the Beauty
Blender because I know the Beauty
Blender is a pricey little sponge and
I'm always asked like okay well what's
the best soup what's the best
alternative and I've been wanting to do
this video for weeks but I wanted to
make sure that I tried out this sponges
as much as I could because I bought a
ton of them just to test them out and to
show them to you guys so that's what
we're going to be talking about today
I'm gonna tell you all about makeup
sponges the good and the bad because
some of these are really really great
alternatives or dupes to the Beauty
Blender but some of these are not I'm
gonna talk to you about prices I'm going
to show you how they look damn and how
they look dry just so you can see
comparisons though oh nine yards we will
be talking about them today I know
there's a ton of youtubers who have done
this video before but I thought I would
give my opinions as well and it was so
requested I'm actually gonna leave
because I'm pretty sure Tati just
recently did one and Mariah so I will
leave their videos down below just in
case you want a second and third opinion
so I'm gonna first talk about my four
favorite makeup sponges I highly
recommend these I'm gonna kind of go and
order from like best all the way to
least so I don't want to talk too much
about this because I know you guys have
heard about this one a million times
this is the Beauty Blender the original
color is pink and I don't know where my
pink Beauty Blender is I think the
savage you might have taken it
supposedly the different colors are for
different things they have a black one a
white one a pink one I don't know to me
they all do the same thing I really
can't tell the difference but it is also
the most expensive one out of all of
them this is a $20 sponge which is a
really high price point but I don't
think there's ever been a brand who has
duped it 100% like literally duping the
exact same sponge there's something
really special about the Beauty Blender
at least I think so when you run it
under water and you squish it a few
times it does expand and it does get
much bigger but it doesn't really retain
any water and it doesn't soak up your
foundation this is
my favorite way to apply foundation
especially if you have dry skin because
it kind of thins out your foundation and
makes it look a little bit more natural
it takes away the cakiness that some
foundations can give you so it is 20
bucks but I do think the Beauty Blender
is worth the money I have one that I
love just as much as this like this is
my favorite but then this one is also my
favorite and to be quite honest I
actually reach for this one more than my
Beauty Blender this sponge is from the
brand pur and it is their contouring
blending sponge and this is my Holy
Grail
besides beautiful under-over this is my
favourite sponge I think it's perfect
not only because of the density and the
way it applies makeup but I love the
shape of this just like the Beauty
Blender when you wet it and you like
rinse out the water it does like double
in size this one isn't as squishy
there's a little bit more density to
this but I don't find that it sucks up
any of my foundation well I mean it's a
sponge it sucks up foundation but some
sponges like will take all of your
foundation this one doesn't do that it
gives me a flawless application just
like the Beauty Blender does and I think
it has a better shape than the Beauty
Blender it has the same roundness so
it's really easy to apply your
foundation this way or you could even
use the flat side really similar to the
Real Techniques that you can just apply
your foundation like this but I prefer
to use it on this side what I love about
the slant is that like I kind of put my
finger like this and I squeeze it and I
get right up underneath my eyes I love
the shape for that it's really really
precise like this angle tip makes it so
precise and you blend out all your
concealer without getting anything on
your eyes or any concealer on your
eyeshadow and I also love the flat side
to bake
I don't really bake that often but when
I do all like dip this into my RCM
a-lying it up to my contour and it bakes
perfectly because of this flat side the
best part is that this is twelve dollars
almost half the price of the Beauty
Blender so very affordable the only
thing is that I'm pretty sure you have
to get it on pure Cosmetics calm I don't
know anywhere else that sells it it used
to come with a contour stick but now you
can buy it individually highly highly
recommend
and the next one is way more popular
than the pure one this is the Real
Techniques miracle complexion perfecting
sponge there are a couple of cons to
this sponge that I'll get into but
overall have dog hair all over these
sponges this one isn't too dense which I
really love you know it's nice and
bouncy and it just works really well I
do feel like it sucks up a little bit of
product like more than the Beauty
Blender does but it's nothing compared
to others that I've tried in the past
they even sell this in a 2-pack at Ulta
for $10.99 which is a really really
great deal the only thing I don't love
about this sponge is that it tears
pretty badly I don't know I've never had
that experience with any of my other
sponges but I go through the Real
Techniques one faster than I go through
any of the other ones it's like every
time I wash this maybe I'm a little bit
too aggressive but every time I wash my
Real Techniques sponge I find that I
kind of rip it or I tear it just a
little bit and I don't know why this
specific sponge like why that happens if
it doesn't happen to my other ones I
don't know and the other thing I don't
love is the shape I know everyone loves
the shape and it is similar to my pure
one but I kind of wish it had a round
side because I prefer to apply my
foundation on this kind of surface than
this kind of surface I know that's weird
but that's just how I feel and I highly
highly recommend the Real Techniques one
and then forth on my list for favorites
is this sponge right here I don't hear
anyone at all talking about this sponge
this one is from the brand mascara
Beauty you can find this at mascara
Beauty calm I believe that she was a
blogger who created a makeup line and
this is called they're a 3d Perfector
this sponge specifically is latex free
and it is $13 so again more affordable
than the Beauty Blender and I have to be
honest this one is the closest dupe to
the Beauty Blender in terms of shape in
density in application and everything
the only thing is of course this one is
just a little bit squishier this one is
a little bit more dense it's just a tad
stiffer that is the only reason it's not
100% dupes but besides that this one
comes pretty freakin close it doesn't
retain water it doesn't soak
my foundation it really is a phenomenal
sponge and I wish more people knew about
it because it's not as cheap as like
real techniques but it's so affordable
compared to the Beautyblender and I
highly highly recommend this one okay so
the next three sponges I want to talk
about all together because they have the
exact same shape two of these are
already wet so I can't show you a before
and after of what they look like dry
versus wet but since one of these is not
dry you kind of have an idea but anyway
these are the three sponges I want to
talk about the exact same shape but they
are from different brands these two are
wet and this one is dry you can see the
size difference when this one is dry it
is the exact same size as this one this
one is from ELF I have two separate elf
sponges I'm going to talk about in this
video this one is just called their
blending sponge now this one is my least
favorite out of the three it's five
bucks so it's the cheapest so far that
I've spoken about but I don't think it's
good and I don't think it's worth it
even though it is five dollars it is
just way too stiff I'm not sure if you
can tell when I bounce it even when it's
wet it's way too stiff obviously once
you wet these sponges they get a little
bit softer and they get bouncier but
this one is still stiff when it's wet I
don't find it soaks up too much product
unlike the other elf sponge I'm going to
talk about but it's just too rough for
me like I feel like I'm like hurting my
face when I'm using this this one right
here is in the middle out of the three
in terms of favorites this is from the
brand swisco and I found it on Ulta like
on the Ulta website it's their precision
blending sponge and this one was $5.99 I
believe it's not as stiff as the elf one
this one I do recommend I actually do
like the shape I like that it comes to
like a point to get underneath the eyes
even though it is a little bit too fat
for my liking but you can always like
squish it and I like that it has this
Ridge here because when you are applying
your foundation your hands cup this
sponge perfectly like beautifully this
does retain more water than the Beauty
Blender does but regardless it's a very
good affordable sponge but it is much
much softer I was extremely shocked when
I first wet this and applied this this
is actually a morphe sponge they came
out with two new sponges this one is
called their flawless beauty sponge
they also have a black one with the
weirdest shape ever but I completely
lost mine I have no idea where it went I
don't like the shape of the black one at
all I just I don't picture myself using
that one because the shape is so weird
this one though they're flawless Beauty
sponge is actually really really nice
there's a ton of brands that have this
shape and most of them like 95% of them
are so stiff like the elf one can you
tell this one is way bouncier I love the
texture of this one I do find that again
it soaks up a little bit more foundation
compared to my pier one and my Beauty
Blender I believe this sponge is only
like five dollars which is so affordable
the only thing is that this one does
bleed in color I had purchased the red
Beauty Blender and after washing it like
three times it pretty much turned pink
like there was so much red dye coming
out of that sponge when I was washing it
that it totally turned me off and I
didn't use that one anymore but this one
even though it does bleed red it's not
as bad as the Beauty Blender like I've
washed it a few times now and it's still
a nice bright red color overall really
great sponge if you are looking for an
alternative to the Beauty Blender the
next sponge I want to talk about is from
Ulta this came in a little box with two
of them it's their makeup blending
sponge duo so it came with two of them
this one is what because I was trying to
get the foundation out of it this little
duo is ten bucks so pretty much five
dollars a sponge really really
affordable but I don't love these I
think that they have better options
this one does soak up a lot of product
and you can see here like it's so hard
to get the foundation out of this sponge
because it like really really soaks it
up I don't like that especially when I'm
trying to blend out my concealer
underneath my eyes when I see that a
sponge is kind of taking away the
coverage of my concealer that's where
I'm like and not my favorite that's the
only thing I don't love about it because
it is nice and bouncy it's not too rough
on my face it's not too stiff it has
nice texture but it soaks up too much so
the last two sponges I will be talking
about are my least favorite sponges I'm
not going to talk about them too long
because I just spoke about them in a
disappointing products video but this is
an elf sponge from eyes lips face calm
and eye
purchased this I came in a trio and it's
called they're like precision sponge
trio and it was $12 for the set which
isn't bad because you're getting three
sponges and they were all different
sizes this one soaks up so much
foundation it almost sucks up more
foundation than it applies on my face I
have tried to wash this sponge like a
hundred times to get that foundation
stain out of it and it doesn't go
anywhere it's like in that sponge for
life I find it to be such a waste of
money because all your foundation like
all the money you spent on your
foundation is being collected in this
and the texture is so weird like it
doesn't have any pores like any of the
other sponges it's like oh and then the
last bunch I will be talking about is
the Tarte quickie blending sponge that's
the name of it the quickie blending
sponge unlike all of the sponges I spoke
about today this one does not expand
much when you rinse it under water like
it it doesn't expand it all really not
that the size has anything to do with
the way that it blends but it doesn't
get bouncy and it doesn't get soft so
it's a very very rough sponge I don't
like this at all it's just it's too
rough on my face it doesn't blend out
the foundation nicely and I don't like
the fact that this round part is a
pointy round part like it's not round
like this sponge it kind of comes to a
point so I find it so weird to apply
foundation
I love Tarte as a brand but this sponge
was an ultimate fail in my opinion and
this one just sixteen bucks
we have those were all sponges that I've
tried within the past two months and
those are my thoughts on them I think
I'm pretty solid for now and I won't
have to buy a sponge for a long time we
had that completes this video I hope it
