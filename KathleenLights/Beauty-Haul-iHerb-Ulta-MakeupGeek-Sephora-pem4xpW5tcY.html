a haul I'm going to share with you guys
a couple of things that I bought in the
past two weeks I went to Sephora Ulta
and I also made a purchase on makeup
geek calm and on I herb calm so I'm
going to share with you guys other
things I got from those four places
so recently makeup geek actually sent me
a few of their eyeshadows and like two
blushes just to try out and I have
bought things off of the makeup geek
website a bunch of times before you know
I love makeup geek pigments I've just
been so obsessed with the eyeshadows
that I got that I went on the website
and I bought four more to add to my
palette so I bought fit in which by the
way I get these in the pan I don't get
them in the compact just because I
believe they're like six dollars in the
pan super super inexpensive and I just
plop them in my Z palette so I bought
fit in which is this color right here it
is a gorgeous gorgeous brick burgundy
red and it's Mac it's so beautiful I
bought cupcake it's just a really pretty
matte pink color this is like the
perfect crease color when you don't want
to use brown this is what it looks like
it's just a really pretty matte pink
perfect for the crease like I said and
it has like purple undertones like a
mauve a purpley pink it's really really
pretty
then I bought chickadee and I've had my
eye on this eyeshadow for such a long
time so I finally bought it it is right
up my alley as you guys know it is like
a bright orange yellow more orange than
yellow but it's not like Mac's rule if
you are familiar with Mac's rule that
one is like super super orange this one
has a little bit more yellow to it so I
picked this one up to like dust it in my
crease just to have like a really nice
orange yellowy crease I love colors like
this as you guys know so that's
chickadee and it's matte and it's super
pigmented and it's super amazing
then I bought prom night and honestly
the reason why I bought prom night is
because I wanted to buy Mac's
satin taupe and then I heard that this
was pretty much an exact dupe for it so
I figured why spend all that money on
Mac satin taupe when I can get makeup
geeks prom night so this is what it
looks like it's so so gorgeous I
honestly think it's prettier than max I
I don't know I've used satin taupe a few
times that I really love it but I just I
think I like this one a little bit more
and then I picked up a blush from makeup
geek the blushes are fairly new and I do
have two other ones that I really really
love so I decided to pick up another one
and this one is called smitten and it's
probably the most beautiful blush I have
ever purchased in my life it is that
perfect peachy orange just look at it
doesn't it look like something I would
absolutely love it is so so amazing so
many of her blushes are sold out right
now so I couldn't really get any of the
ones I really wanted but actually out of
all the ones that I wanted this is the
one I wanted the most so I'm glad that
it was still in stock it is perfect it
is the blush I am wearing right now it
just dusted it really lightly on my
cheeks and it gives you like a beautiful
summer flush I've no idea Queen it this
is the most gorgeous blush in the world
but now I'm going to move on to the
stuff I got at Sephora I posted a
picture of this like two weeks ago on my
Instagram I got this around two weeks
ago and it is a NARS duo in this shade
is old pretty I'm saying that right I
hope I am but this is what it looks like
has been my go-to eye shadow like since
I bought it like it is gorgeous look at
it guys I know what you're thinking well
I'm pretty sure that was made for you
and yes I agree you know I feel about
coppers and burnt oranges and golds and
this is such a pretty duo they
complement each other so well how these
NARS duels are really expensive but the
pigmentation is really really good and I
love them this is what I have on my eyes
today these are the only eyeshadows I
have on my eyes with the exception of
like a light brown and my crease in like
a matte cream color as my highlight but
yeah these are the only eye shadows I'm
wearing right now and I love it love it
love it love it by the way guys I do
want to do something a little bit
different from now on whenever I have a
high-end haul the next haul will be a
drugstore haul I want to keep it like
balanced I don't have like a variety of
different things you know so the next
haul I will be doing on my channel will
be a drugstore haul actually purchase a
crock
and of stuff off the elf website because
it was 50% off so I'm gonna have another
huge alcohol to share with you guys but
yeah my beside that my next haul will be
a drugstore haul just in case
you guys don't really like high-end
hauls I know a lot of you do but some of
you don't so you know I want to please
everyone you know okay so the next thing
I bought is something I had never seen
before I haven't heard anybody talk
about it but I saw it on display and I
was like oh I want that it is the Becca
Beach tint shimmer souffle I got mine in
the shade fig / opal and this is what it
looks like it's pretty much in the same
packaging as like Mac Paint Pots just to
give you a reference and it's basically
a shimmery like glowy blush let me read
to what it says just so you guys know it
says a pop of luminescent color and an
Airwick cheek souffle water-resistant
and oil-free it provides effortlessly
buildable color with soft lustrous
finish and yes it is a souffle it is
like it's a cream but it's not no it's
not a cream it's like a whipped moosie
texture so yeah it's definitely not a
cream when you put your finger in it
it's like Lucy and I decided to go with
fig / opal because it's the one I saw
myself using the most they have a bunch
of different colors I believe they have
like six this one is very very light and
very subtle and natural but I like that
because it is buildable you can get it
pretty intense on your cheek that's a
pink but it's a very golden a pink like
a warm pink like a rose gold I decided
to pick this up because I thought it
would be the perfect thing for summer
just to put this all over my cheeks and
skip the step of actually doing blush
and highlight it's just like everything
and you look very Jennifer Lopez II you
know I love to lift it up a little I
finally picked up a bite Beauty lipstick
I am obsessed with these I have like two
duo's and I use them all the time
they're amazing so I finally picked up a
full-size and I went with the color
called cava and the reason why I picked
this one up is because Nicole from young
wild and polish I think she called this
not too long ago
it looked nice once you swatched it so I
bought it so this is what it looks like
the packaging is so amazing it has like
that same NARS packaging and it looks
like a used lipstick like that's what
they were going for but anyway this is
what the color looks like at first I was
a little bit scared when I saw it at
Sephora and I was like oh I don't know
if I want that my I might look dead
because it is a nude but it's like a
Mavi nude like a purpley nude but it
actually looks so so beautiful on the
lips doesn't make me look dead I think
it's really really pretty and I think
that a lot of people would like this and
these by beauty lipsticks are so
incredible they have incredible
ingredients you could literally eat it
and it would be okay I don't recommend
you eat it though I'm just saying you
can I picked up one of the Josie Maran
coconut water color eyeshadows I got
mine in the shade Playa del pink it's
the one that I like the most out of all
of them um so it this stuff is really
cool it looks like this let me show you
it looks like this it looks like a
little bottle and then you have like all
the pigment at the bottom and like the
oil or like the water coconut water at
the top and what you do is you shake it
and then you use it you have to shake it
every time you use it but it comes with
this little thing right here that has a
Kate doe foot applicator so you just
open this up and apply this right inside
close it up and this is your eyeshadow
and it's easy to use because of that doe
foot applicator and the color is on
ryoga's this is like the most metallic e
like pink like a champagne like pink but
it's so gorgeous
it's really really metallic which is
what I loved about it like the second i
swatched I was like oh no no I'm buying
you your beautiful
so keeping on with my origins obsession
I have slowly become like an origins
fanatic I wanted to get a daytime
moisturizer from them so I picked up the
origins of it--is ding SPF 15 energy
boosting moisturizer with mangosteen and
I got this because
really good things about it it has a
sheer tint release so it does come out
with like a tint at first when you
squeeze it out of the tube it is white
that's what it looks like but at first
when you squeeze it out of the tube it
is a white product like a gray color but
as you rub it into your skin um it
starts to build color and the tint
starts to show and I don't know if you
can tell there the tint that it forms it
is like a very I wouldn't say orange
color but it is a warm tint which
actually really really like because in
the morning when my skin looks a little
bit dull and gross and I just rubbed
this in all over my face it gives my
face life it makes my skin look super
youthful without using any foundation
concealer or anything I really like this
so far both of this picture on Instagram
as well not too long ago this is the Too
Faced natural eyes palette and this is
like the new and improved version it
says it's new and it's better than ever
three new shades and obviously change
the packaging Too Faced has completely
changed their packaging and I love their
new packaging is so amazing and it's
super cute so this is what it looks like
honestly guys I love this so much more
than I thought I would I have to say
like I love this so freakin much I could
do an entire video of this palette
because honestly if I sat here and
talked about this um this video would be
crazy long so let me know in the
comments down below if you want me to do
a review swatches and all that stuff on
this palette because it is honestly one
of the best to face palettes I've ever
come across so let me know down below
the next thing I picked up from Sephora
makes me feel like a fool really this
guy I've always said if you need a cream
eyeliner gel eyeliner liquid liner a pen
eyeliner go to the drugstore you do not
need to buy a high-end liquid liner
because they have phenomenal ones at the
drugstore but I was standing at Sephora
and I was watching this on my hand and I
was like wow this is really black and
beautiful and then when I got home I
could not take it off my hand I was like
oh my god this is like smudge proof so I
was just so impressed that I went I
bought it and I'm talking
the Kat Von D tattoo liner in the shade
a trooper and what really intrigued me
with this eyeliner is that it's not a
felt tip even though it's a pen and it
looks like it's a felt tip it's not it's
a brush tip but I like it I feel so bad
that I bought this because I never buy
high-end liners but this one is so good
and it has raving reviews and people
really liked it so I hope I love it I
mean I already do but okay guys so that
was everything I got at Sephora now I'm
going to move on and show you what I got
at Ulta picked up the benefit rocket or
blush and I have grabbed this put it
back grabbed it put a back rub dipping
back like 17,000 times every time I walk
into Sephora Ulta and I was just like oh
my god just get it you want it just get
it but this was like on the inside it is
a beautiful rose gold color and I really
had no intentions of buying this when it
first came out but every time I see
somebody wearing this I'm like wow her
cheeks lips so beautiful so decided to
pick it up and it smells pretty good it
smells like laundry detergent and soap
in my opinion I mean it's not like ooh
delicious but it smells good
the last three things I got at Alta were
drugstore products I picked up the
covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundations I'm like super late on the
outlast Foundation train but I've always
seen a lot of people with oily skin
really really loved this so I stayed
away from this for a long time but I
used it the other day because my friend
had it and I was like wow I actually
really like this so as long as i mooster
eyes before I put this on I really like
it I got the shade medium beige which I
shouldn't have because there is a little
bit of pink in this like I know when I
put it on I mean beige should have been
show giving that away but like when I
put it on it still works for me I can
get it to work but there's like a smidge
of pink in there somewhere
you know it's neutral but just a little
bit and I don't like pink at all like
pink scarcity so yeah I actually really
really like this though then I picked up
two lip products I picked up the Rimmel
show off lip lacquer in new to eclipse
this is what's on my lips right now it's
just a really pretty nude color and
last a really really long time on your
lips and then I got this that I have
been wanting forever these things came
out a long time ago but every time I
went to go find this color it was sold
out this is the revlon colorburst matte
balm in complex this is what it looks
like it's just a really pretty like warm
apricot peach I don't know that was
probably a terrible description but it's
really gorgeous and I love love love
these okay now moving on to the things I
got I heard calm this video is probably
really really long let's try to move
quickly if you don't know I heard that
comments it's like a website where you
can get like organic stuff they have
makeup they have a lot of good stuff on
there and they're usually a lot of good
coupons coupon codes for that website so
I ran out of my coconut oil recently so
my hair has not been feeling the best so
I had to go and pick up another coconut
oil so that's what I got I got a
different brand this time I usually get
nature's way but it's pretty much the
same thing as long as you get organic
extra virgin coconut oil it doesn't
matter what brand you get so I picked up
a tub of that love love love coconut oil
I picked up something that I have been
wanting to try pretty really long time
and it is the layers layers and pictures
I say it alcohol-free toner unscented
witch hazel with aloe vera formula they
have a bunch of different sense they
have peach rose one cucumbers lavender
but I want with the unscented one just
to be safe because every toner that I
have ever used has broken me out every
toner every time so I went with this one
because it is alcohol-free which is
really really important to me I didn't
want a toner with alcohol because my
skin is so dry and it is unscented witch
hazel which they have pretty natural
things in this let me open this actually
have not used this yet I don't know why
I'm smelling it it's incentive but yeah
I've heard really good things about
these toners so I'm hoping it doesn't
break me out
those good things to my skin I picked up
the health and beauty as tech secret
Indian healing clay world's most
powerful facial deep pore cleansing 100%
natural calcium bentonite clay that's a
mouthful but that's what I got and I
mainly bought this for Danny honestly
because he has like big pores and men
you know men don't really take care of
their faces but I also bought this for
myself too and I've heard crazy things
about this I hear it is like really
really like an intense clay mask that's
basically what did it a clay mask you
mix it with either water or apple cider
vinegar and then you apply like a thick
layer to your face and then rinse it off
kinda like a glam glow mask but this was
like five dollars and I hear it is
really intense and really really works
so I will let you guys know about this
and the last thing I got I got because
Shannon or Shannon XO Shannon you know
you guys know Shannon she talks about
these things all the time and they are
the Curragh lip balms I have always
wondered where I could purchase this and
you guys can get it I heard calm I
thought this was like a New Zealand
thing but no I got mine I heard calm I
got my name is moon beam this is just
like the overnight one it's blue
camomile vanilla and love anything with
chamomile so this is the one I got she
raves about these because she says
they're her favorite like natural lip
balms it does say premium organic vegan
and raw ingredients and you can
definitely tell when you put this on
your lips and you're putting on
something really really natural I love
the scent of this oh my god this one
smells amazing so yeah it's just a
really nice natural lip balm I actually
put this last night before I went to bed
and when I woke up my lips were nice and
moisturized and this is only like three
bucks so I got the whole roll of lip
balm okay so that is everything I got in
my home um that I've been chopping for
the past two weeks let me know down
below if or anything you're curious to
know about or anything like that
