a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now I was gonna do a
chatty get ready with me I was already
four I try to get rid of me I have my
wine but my throat is killing me still
trying to get over my cold you're
probably thinking like wow you had a
cold for a long time now but I'm
actually pre recording videos because
I'll be out of town when you're watching
this so I didn't want to talk too much
in this video so it is in voiceover I'm
sorry but I will be recording a get
ready with me more often like chatty get
ready with me I hear your request I will
be filming those more often but today I
wanted to use the Becca and Jaclyn hill
champagne glow collection I used the
face palette it's amazing amazing I'm
not gonna do like a whole review cuz I
know there's like a hundred videos
reviewing this already I just wanted to
show you this look I used the eyeshadow
palette the face palette and the liquid
illuminator and all that I totally think
I overdid it with the glow I'm like
super glowy but that's the point
it's a glowy collection so if you want
to see how to get this really dewy
summery bronzy look and just keep
watching okay so I'm starting off by
priming my face using the Becca primer
this is the back light priming filter
and then I went in with the Becca Becca
Becca aqua luminous foundation I have to
speed this part up because you guys for
some reason I just take forever to blend
this into my skin it's just one of those
foundations I really have to work in for
it to look as natural as possible but
when I do it's beautiful the concealer
I'm using is the Catrice camouflage
concealer at first this was going to be
a one brand tutorial like I was gonna do
only backup products but then I realized
I was using a couple of other things
that were in Becca so it just didn't end
up happening but I use a lot of Becca in
this video so I'm just popping that in
with my Sedona lace two one seven brush
to semi concealer I'm going to use my
trusty it cosmetics bye bye pores
pressed powder and I'm just setting my
under eye concealer setting my eyes
because I also used that concealer kind
of as a primer for the future and I'm
just setting anywhere I put the
concealer basically that's what I'm
setting I'm going to take the Becca
shimmering skin perfecter liquid in
Champagne pop I love it it is beautiful
I'm using a sponge to apply this to the
tops of my cheekbones and on my nose and
all the places I want to highlight this
is a sponge from the brand mascara but
you can use any sponge a Beauty Blender
the Real Techniques sponge they work
really well with liquid highlights this
is amazing I highly highly recommend you
get the liquid version of champagne pop
it is stunning like I definitely like it
a lot more than I thought I would I mean
I knew I was feeling like it but I love
it so I'm just bronzing up my skin with
my Physicians Formula butter bronzer but
then I wanted something a little bit
warmer so I took out my Kiko desert
dunes bronzer this is like one of their
new summer bronzers I bought it on the
Kiko website and I got mine in the shade
warm and I just use this to warm up my
skin a little bit and now I'm using the
Becca and Jacqueline Hill champagne
collection face palette it's beautiful
this mirror is insane it's it's amazing
it's amazing the blush I'm going to use
is amaretto it's kind of like a matte a
warm peachy shade beautiful I love this
blush it was the first time I used it
and I loved it it was beautiful to
highlight my cheekbones some more I took
a little bit of Prosecco pop and then I
applied champagne pop on top Prosecco
pop is just a little bit too gold for me
but the combination of the two is really
pretty so BAM that's a highlight okay so
now I'm going to take the eyeshadow
palette I'm going to take the shade
cordial and I'm going to use this in my
crease I usually do one eye off-camera
but honestly I was totally winging this
look like I didn't even know what I was
gonna end up doing so I just you know
winged it
I'm going to take the Marc Jacobs
twinkle pop in the shade three shakes
and I'm applying this to my entire lid
kind of like a base for the eyeshadow
and blending that out with my finger and
then I'm going to take the eye shadow
named champagne toast and I'm applying
that right on top of the base I put down
I've heard kind of like mixed reviews of
this palette I think Becca like did
something with the formula I'm not sure
what the buzz is but I actually really
like my palette I think the quality is
pretty good I'm taking the shade cognac
and I'm applying that on the outer
corners of my eyes and then dragging
them into my crease and then taking a
different brush and buffing out the
edges so that there are no harsh lines
and I do that a couple times go back
into cognac and then just buff out the
edges then I took the shade Bordeaux and
added very little of this to the outer
corners of my eyes
I used Chardonnay in the palette to
highlight my brow bone and my inner
corners this is a makeup geek eyeliner
full spectrum eyeliner in the shade
plumeria and I'm using this to apply to
my waterline and then I take Bordeaux on
a pencil brush and kind of just buff it
out I don't want my waterline to look
too red so adding the eyeshadow and
buffing that out kind of helps and then
I took cognac and just did the same
thing and then I skipped false lashes
and applied tons of mascara for my lips
I'm using the Milani lipstick in the
shade matte naked and that completes
this look thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
