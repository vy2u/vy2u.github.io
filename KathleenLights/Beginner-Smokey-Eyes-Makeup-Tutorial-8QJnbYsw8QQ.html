tutorial on the look I'm wearing it is
literally the easiest I look ever I know
I say that a lot but this one is really
easy yet still looks nice and sultry and
smoky perfect for beginners really
excited for this one because today's
video is sponsored by chasse doh
I'm gonna be using their synchro skin
lasting liquid foundation in today's
tutorial and I will go into detail about
this guy in a second I'm usually the
shade golden too but in today's video I
mixed a little bit of golden 4 in with
this because golden 2 is too light and
golden forest too dark so I mixed a
little rebel but besides that I love
this look and this eye look was created
with really really affordable products
so yes if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching so
please excuse my eyes and also excuse my
voice I am sick at the moment I'm going
to take the hard candy hydrating primer
mist and spraying that on my face and
then I'm going to prime my face using
the NYX angel veil primer and for
foundation I'm gonna be using the
Shiseido synchros skin a lasting liquid
foundation this foundation comes in 11
shades and it was actually designed to
synchronize with your skin so that it
could look really natural when you apply
it which I totally agree with by the way
I think that once I apply this this
looks really really natural on my skin
Shiseido is actually known for their
skincare and all of their foundations
have skincare benefits in them which is
pretty cool
also this foundation is oil-free it has
SPF 20 but I don't find that it gives me
a white cast in photos I tried it with
my camera and I get zero flash back in
photography I also think the coverage is
great I'm not sure if you can tell but
it does a great job of covering up my
redness but I do think it's buildable I
think it's a medium coverage but
definitely buildable because it feels
just so weightless on the skin so moving
on I'm going in with my concealer this
is the Catrice camouflage concealer and
this has great coverage so obviously I'm
using it because my eyes are
very read at the moment so I'm just
blending that in with my Real Techniques
sponge
and then I'm going to set my under eye
concealer using my NARS translucent
crystal powder for my bronzer I'm going
to be using this bareMinerals bearskin
sheer Sun serum bronzer it has a long
name but I love this liquid bronzer I
think it's one of my favorite liquid
bronzers I've ever tried I guess because
it's a serum it just blends really
really well on the skin so I'm just
applying that to my face to not only
bronze up the skin but contour a bit as
well I'm going to take this elf total
face palette I'm going to dip my brush
into the bronzer shade in this palette
and I'm just going to warm up my skin
with this color I really like this
bronzer because even though it is warm
it's subtle and it's not like an orange
you warm it's very very flattering okay
I'm also going to take the blush in this
palette this is like a really peachy
pretty blush I'm not just applying this
with my Sonia Kashuk blush brush and now
moving on to the eyes I'm taking this
Milani shadow stick in the shade cafe au
lait it's a really pretty cool tone
Brown and I'm just buffing that onto my
lid with a synthetic brush now I'm going
to take the Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral
matte palette and I'm going to take this
NYX crease brush I'm taking this really
light brown shade and blending this into
the crease to just kind of get rid of
any harsh lines then I'm going to take
the wet and wild single eye shadow in
the shade this was a super affordable
product I think it was like two dollars
and I am just applying this to my entire
lid and I'm gonna go back into that
brown shade and just buff it some more
you know no harsh lines blending
blending one thing this is another
single shadow from the Brad wet and wild
it's called sugar and I'm using this to
highlight my brow bone but to highlight
my inner corners I'm taking the elf
baked blush in the shade pink tastic I'm
going to tightline with a black eyeliner
and also apply some to my waterline and
then blend it out with a little angled
brush
this was the NYX tragedy black gel liner
I'm going in with this wet and wild eye
shadow another single eye shadow this is
in the shade panther it's a really rich
black and I'm just gonna
use this as an eyeliner instead of using
a liquid liner or a gel liner I'm just
going to take an angled brush and dip it
into the eyeshadow and create an
eyeliner this way it's very very
beginner friendly and so easy to do so
then I'm going to go on my lower lash
line and just buff out that brown shade
just so that the black doesn't look too
harsh and unblended so I'm just popping
on some mascara this is the Kiko extra
sculpt - Volume Mascara and then I'm
going to go ahead and bronze my skin a
little bit more I just wanted a little
bit more bronzer I was feeling more
broadly this so I'm taking the NARS
Laguna bronzer and just applying that to
my face and then to highlight the tops
of my cheekbones I'm taking elf baked
blush in pink tastic the same product we
use on the inner corners just to give my
face that glow and then for lips my lips
are naturally very very red and
pigmented as you can see so I just took
a little bit of concealer and I just
want it to like new out the color of my
lips so I just blend that out and then
applied the NYX butter gloss in the
shade fortune cookie and then that
completes this look thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
