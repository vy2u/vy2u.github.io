a full face of makeup I'm going to show
you how to get this look right here I'm
actually testing out a bunch of new
makeup in this video a lot of first
impressions today almost had a full face
of first impressions but not really but
I'm using the new lunar Beauty palette
and a bunch of other new fun stuff so if
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching ok so I've
already primed my lids with the pea
Louise makeup base and now I'm gonna go
into the life's a drag I shadow palette
I haven't wanting to play with this so
bad but I've been out of town but I'm
finally back I can't wait this is
actually a lot bigger than I thought it
was gonna be like when I saw manis video
I don't know it it surprised me it's
like a statement like this is a
statement palette like I feel like a lot
of money went into this packaging anyway
I've been seeing a lot of really
colorful bold makeup looks with this so
I think I'm gonna go with the more
natural route surprise surprise don't
ever wrong I definitely want to do more
fun colorful looks with this I feel like
I've just seen so many I want to
showcase the more neutral wearable
shades in the palette as well because
there's so many things you can do I
don't really want to get into too much
detail on this this isn't like a
full-blown review but I think it's
really great that there's a white and a
black in this palette because you can
use these shades to really manipulate
any of the other shades you can make
these colors a lot more pastel with the
white or make them a lot deeper with the
black I'm very excited to try this out I
didn't want to do a full review on this
eyeshadow palette just because I feel
like there are so many reviews online
already like if you just go on YouTube
and search life's the drags review
there's a lot so let's dive in I'm gonna
take the shade sickening right here
and I'm going to use this as my
transition shade just pop this into the
crease
if I can to zoom you in more you know
what I've really noticed I shadows man
you really just have to apply them to
the eyes because you really cannot
depend on arm swatches I really like
this shade it kind of has like a soft
peachy undertone it's so pretty
okay now I'm gonna take this delicious
like hot pink and I'm just gonna dust
this really lightly in the crease I just
want to add a more pink vibe to this
look these are pigmented I feel like I
can never say that word ever again
without thinking of Mannie
I didn't tap my brush off enough but
that's okay
first impressions make me so
uncomfortable you guys have no idea I'm
gonna go back into that first shade we
used and I am trying to fight off all
the desire I have to use this yellow but
I won't I'm not gonna use the yellow not
going to use the yellow the combo of
sickening and this pink makes such a
pretty coral
these eyeshadows are really really easy
to blend now I'm going to take the shade
trade right here start building this
color on the outer corners okay on a
smaller more precise blending brush I'm
going to go into snatched and I'm just
gonna play a little bit of this on the
outer corners basically the same thing
we've been doing this whole time but I'm
not gonna apply too much of this color I
just want to make it a little bit more
ready toned so I'm adding a little bit
okay now I'm gonna take a little bit of
my mix milk megaplex
concealer by Maxwell and I'm just gonna
add a little bit of this concealer right
here and the dogs are blended that out
with a brush okay now I'm gonna take my
finger and I'm gonna go into this shade
beat right here this color is so pretty
and interesting at first when I saw it
online it looks just like a regular
basic everyday pink shimmer but it
actually isn't this color is actually
really unique kind of have like blue
little flecks of shimmer in it and it
just looks so wet and beautiful
wow that is without any fix+ this color
is so unique I think it's my favorite
eyeshadow in the entire palette it's so
cool I'm gonna go back into the shade
trade right here deepen out the outer
corners and blend everything together
I'm going to go back into chi Chi here
and I'm just going to stamp that in
between the shimmer and the matte
and the high said I was gonna do a super
wearable neutral eyeshadow look and
that's not what happened at all okay now
I'm gonna go into the shade mug you know
I'm just stamping that color right here
towards the very bottom I'm not taking
it up into the crease because I'm about
to apply some black eyeshadow here yeah
I don't want it to be too harsh so I'm
just putting it down with a little bit
of that Brown okay on that exact same
brush I'm gonna pick up shady which is
the black shade again I just want to add
just a little bit of depth and darkness
on the outer corners because I feel like
that's what it's missing
okay so I'm gonna go back into the
palette a little bit later once I finish
up the face but I'm gonna take the shape
cake face and I'm gonna use that to
highlight with I normally would not
highlight with a white but that's what
we've got so that's what I'm gonna do
okay
I'm not using a brand new foundation in
today's video because I want to test out
this primer and I feel like in order for
me to give this primer a fair shot I
have to try it with a foundation I
already like so I just bought this off
of the Sephora website this is the Dior
air flash radiance mist I was really
intrigued by this
it says primer and setting spray
long-lasting airbrushed radiance what
then it's so crazy
should I just spray it on my face I just
whoa
you know what let me read how that
smells very strong okay three-in-one
setting spray by dr that preps sets and
refreshes makeup this has a hyaluronic
acid in it that's awesome that's great
for hydration this fuses with the skin
leaving it fresh soft and ready for
makeup pulled eight inches away from
face close eye and spray alright
that's what I'm saying this is so
strange I feel like I sprayed that a lot
and I didn't get that much product off
I'm gonna wear this throughout the day
and I'll update you guys in the
description box letting you know if I
felt like my foundation lasted longer we
will see but I'm gonna use my Physicians
Formula healthy foundation I love this I
use it all the time and I really like
this but I don't think it's very long
wearing so hopefully that primer helps I
always mix the shades lw2 and mw2 and
I'm gonna be buffing that in with my
airbrush full coverage complexion brush
by it cosmetics really love the Dior air
flash foundation so when I saw that
primer I was like oh I really really
want to try that out so hopefully I like
it because it's a suspense okay I also
don't have a new concealer I'm sorry
don't hate me so I'm just gonna be
mixing these two this is my milk makeup
flex concealer and my makeup revolution
full coverage conceal and contour
concealer thingy I'm using the shade
light in this milk concealer but I'm
using the shade C 6 in the makeup
revolution one to add a little bit of
brightness under the eyes
man I've never used the whoa whoa
I have never used those two concealers
mixed with each other and I do not like
the combo let me just say can you see
that you guys don't think I had anything
to do with my primer right we're gonna
pretend that concealer combo is great
and you have these two consumers don't
mix them okay so I also don't have a
powder
I'm gonna use my hourglass setting
powder this is the new veiled
translucent setting powder I still don't
know how I feel about it I feel like
people made it seem like this was the
best powder they've ever used and I
didn't get that I feel like like I feel
like it's good but I don't know if it's
great I might love it in a week I don't
know but I'm for right now I'm still I'm
still testing the waters it's so funny
because I was recently at a ko polish
photo shoot and I was in a rush to get
out of there at the end of the day like
at the end of the photo shoot and got me
was like oh can you make sure in your
makeup bag that I packed your
heart-shaped Eve container make sure I
didn't take it and I was like it's fine
and I'm sure you packed it it's fine she
was like can you can you just check and
I was like it's fine I left and when I
got home I realized no she did not pack
my heart-shaped tape but I can't be mad
because she told me to check and I
didn't so now I am shaped tapeless and I
hate it okay so I'm gonna take this
sephora glide liner I had never used it
before until I used it right now on the
other eye this is in the shade red berry
it's a very reddish purpley tone and
it's really really pretty and I'm just
gonna add this to my waterline my tight
line as well but I'm also gonna drag it
a little bit lower then my waterline and
I'm gonna blend it out with a brush and
then I'm just gonna blend some of this
trade eyeshadow right on top of it
then going in with sickening I'm just
gonna use this color to really buff out
the lower lash line and make it a little
bit smoky err and more blended then on a
very very tiny little pencil brush I'm
gonna dip into the shade shady and I'm
just gonna play a little bit of this on
the outer corners just so that it can
match the top of my lid okay and then
for the inner corners I'm actually gonna
take this highlighter in this house of
mirrors duo from colour-pop okay so for
this look I would normally apply some
falsies of course like this look totally
calls for lashes but you know what I
honestly think I'm gonna skip falsies I
know that with this kind of palette
everybody's putting on falsies but I'm
here to tell you that you don't have to
you don't have to wear falsies to rock
this palette okay you can wear regular
mascara I'm actually gonna curl my
lashes and apply a ton of this Lancome
amongst your big mascara and I will be
right back to finish the base alright I
really really love how that look turned
out so pretty so could help release
these little duo's they have a bronzer
and a highlight they're like little
bronzer highlight duos
I gave one away to a friend but I kept
house of mirrors and up the ante really
really cute I love the highlight in this
house of mirrors one so I'm actually
gonna take this one I'm gonna take the
contour powder and I'm gonna contour Zee
face this is my equal tools precision
powder brush
feeling that has a really pretty
undertone I'm actually going to dip into
the bronzer in up the ante which is a
very pretty deep let me just add a
little bit of this
that's really pretty but I feel like I
need some warmth like some Brahms eNOS
to the skin and actually Joey just
recently launched bezoar actually I
don't know if they're available just yet
but I just got these in PR these are
their new little duo's and they're like
bronzer duo's this is for a light to
medium and this is for medium to deep
but the light to medium is completely
like matte the medium to deep is not
matte it has like the little shimmers
and glitters in it which I don't know
why they did that what if they all be
mad or obvi shimmer I don't know is that
a weird thing to complain about like I
feel like that throws me off like
because I look aside okay so I am gonna
go into the medium to deep because I
want some shimmer eNOS in my life and I
feel like the other dual is just like
way too light and matte you know if I
gave me a really nice like golden glow
in a subtle way but it's there it's
there I see it I really like this
bronzer I don't know how this would look
on very deep skin tone I'm curious to
know okay so I also don't I mean I suck
but I also don't have a brand new blush
but I'm gonna go into you get a stick
watch that this one isn't - is the
cinnamon this is bear peach but I love
them both I'm just gonna take it a
little bit of Burt's Bees
bear peach blush I'm sorry guys these
are my favorite blushes in the whole
world okay when you love something you
can't let it go
and then for highlight I'm gonna take
that highlighter in the house of mirrors
duo there's something about it and I was
like this dual chrome vibe to it it's
like a little peachy a little pink
actually you know what I'm gonna try so
you a recently launched this as well
this is the new powder highlight in
celestial which you guys know me I'm not
really into these lavender pinky
highlights I'm not into colorful
highlights at all but I don't know if
you can tell with this one you can
really only see the pink when it hits a
certain light this might be one that I
actually like so I do want to add a
little bit cuz I think it would tie into
the look just pop on some pink I like
why not what I'm looking forward you
really can't see that lavender purple
all that much I'm actually gonna focus
it more towards the back so it looks a
little bit more wearable okay
now let's use this as a setting spray
don't see how this goes oh my god you
know this is weird I don't think I like
this other settings brandy oh it doesn't
really feel wet the fact that a setting
spray is wet and it's like water really
helps the powder to really sink into the
skin okay I'm gonna get an actual
settings for you anyway lips are really
really excited because code puff has
released brand new lip glosses they're
still called the ultra glossy lips but
they have a different finish I have the
high shine finishes and they actually
come with a brush applicator instead of
a doe foot applicator these are just
extra shiny and ultra glossy they even
have a whole boil in them hoh-hoh oil in
them and they just look really
phenomenal
I haven't even tested them out but just
watching them like the formula looks
like it's gonna be great so really
quickly I'm gonna line my lips with this
you a long wear lip liner in the shade
nude I've actually never used this
before I've used their red colors and
their pinks but I've never used
dude these are so freakin pigmented like
almost too pigmented I like something
with a little bit more grip not
something that's so slippery like these
I'm still deciding whether I like these
or not okay now that I've overdrawn my
lips a bit
cookies lip filler you've got lip liners
I don't know which one I want to use oh
my gosh there's so many colors okay what
I want to do a glittery one I'm in
between these three wait am i wait a
minute this one this one this one this
is in the shade snow day this one's kind
of clearish though that's okay
Oh oh my gosh please feel great my
friend gabby is gonna be all about these
lip glosses she's obsessed with gloss
and these are glossy ooh but they're not
like sticky I mean they have a little
bit of you know something but they're
not like sticky I feel like I want a
pinky or gloss though no wait wait a
second wait again I want to do here's to
you yeah
these are very sheer there's not much
color to them so just keep that in mind
like I really like there wasn't much of
a change there was there these smells so
incredible mmm delicious
okay I gotta go before this video is
like 45 minutes long okay guys so that
completes this video I hope you enjoyed
this full face oh no I'm sorry this is

bronzer the highlights
