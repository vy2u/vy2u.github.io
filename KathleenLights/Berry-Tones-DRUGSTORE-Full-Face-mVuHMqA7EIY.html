a makeup tutorial on this look I'm just
going to start off by saying quickly I
have pickups
so this voiceover might not go very well
anyway it's a really like romantic girly
look with cranberry eyes and then like a
berry lip as well usually I don't do
this I usually would go for a nude lip
but I decided to switch things up so I
hope you like it I'm going to go ahead
and get started with priming my eyelids
this is the LA girl Pro conceal
concealer and I love priming my eyelids
with it I'm going to take this Wet n
Wild I shadow in the shade Brule it's
just like a cream color and I'm going to
use this to set my concealer I'm going
to add a tape to the side of my eye to
create like a cat eye and I'm going to
take this eye shadow right here called
Bella cappuccino and this is my
transition shade so I do have to pack
this color on quite a bit because it's
not super super pigmented so I'm going
back and forth into that eye shadow and
just deepening up my crease a bit this
is the transition shade I think I
already said that I'm going to take this
baked eye shadow from ELF and it is
called ver plum they are it is a big eye
shadow so it is better to use it wet so
I'm going to take Mac's fix plus and
spray my brush mac fix+ is not drugstore
but you can just use eye drops at home
and I'm just going to pack that color on
my lid one more time and this is just
going to intensify the look a lot more
I'm going to take that up to my crease
and I'm going to take this brush from
Real Techniques it's the same one we use
to apply the Brule shade Brule shade and
I'm just going to blend out some harsh
edges I'm going to take a fluffy crease
brush this is from morphe and I'm going
to dip it back into brick plum without
any water I'm not wetting the brush or
anything just to soften up the crease a
little bit more this
is an eyeshadow by L'Oreal it's a
beautiful beautiful color it's called
glistening garnet and this is what made
me want to do this tutorial because it's
such a pretty berry but it has like
pinky undertones it's really pretty if
you hear porter running behind me his
collar has a little bell and it makes
noise yeah so I'm just packing that on
to my entire lid I also wet the brush a
little bit with this shade you don't
need to but I just wanted to intensify
it just a little bit more then I'm going
to dip my brush into this eyeshadow
called Bella taupe and this is an elf
brush and I'm just applying it to the
outer view of my eye and into my crease
of it just to make it a little bit more
like chocolatey and then I'm going to
take a clean blending brush and blend
out the edges this is a black eye shadow
from Wet n Wild called Panther it is a
super super black eye shadow so I'm
using a very light hand with that same
elf brush and I'm just going to pack
some of it to the outer V I'm going to
deepen it up later but just adding a
little bit of that black to the outer V
of my eye to deepen things up I'm going
to go back into brulee and add this
underneath my brow bone this is just
going to help things like look a little
bit more blended and a little bit nicer
I'm going to take this NYC liquid
eyeliner this is my favorite liquid
eyeliner in the history of the world
because it is super black and super
matte when it comes to a brush tip this
one is the best so I'm adding a wing not
too thin not like non-existent but not
thick either that make sense you could
do whatever you want don't do a Wayne
going the world is your oyster my friend
so I'm going to finish up my face well
I'm going to start my face before finish
up my eyes as you can see I'm listening
I'm watching my homegirl back there on
YouTube as I got ready but anyway this
is my maybelline baby skin primer and
it's I just put it on the areas where my
pores are a little bit bigger then I'm
going to take this foundation from
Rimmel it's the Rimmel stay matte
foundation this is the shade true ivory
I believe I will have my shade down
below so I'm using this with a zoeva
brush and I am just packing this on and
buffing it into my skin
then I'm going to take that concealer
used to prime my eyelids and I'm going
to take a little bit of it on the inner
part of my eye and right where my dark
circles are more visible because this is
kind of like a pinky shade a little bit
of a Sam in the undertone this is in the
shade natural and I'm just going to
blend that in a little bit to cover up
my dark circles
then I'm going to be taking this Rimmel
match perfection
two-in-one it's a highlight and a
concealer all-in-one so I'm using this
mainly to highlight my face it's going
to cover up my dark circles just a
little bit but I'm using it mainly to
highlight so I'm highlighting in all
those places you know folk in my nose
all that good stuff
and then for some reason I decided to
blend that all in with that same Real
Techniques brush I used earlier but
don't know why but that's what I did I'm
just blending that out I'm going to set
it with the same powder i always use
it's my favorite drugstore one for
underneath the eyes it's the Maybelline
fit me powder in 1/35 I love it because
it's kind of like light reflecting it
has like a a little hint of shimmer it's
amazing I'm gonna take this eye shadow
to contour I know that's really weird
but that's what I'm doing this is called
Bella cafe and it has like a kind of
like a gray undertone not great but it's
a cool toned Brown so that's why I'm
using it to contour this brush is
actually a brush I got in benefits hoola
bronzer and this is a pretty good dupe
for the NARS eita brush if you don't
wanna pay $60 because I refuse to pay
that much for one brush then if you have
hoola and you haven't thrown away this
brush Oh fix that hair girl if you
haven't thrown away this brush you can
use it to contour it gets like a really
sharp chisel contour Simon I'm using
this eyeshadow and I'm blending it out
and it blends really nicely I love this
eyeshadow to contour anyway I don't know
who I'm talking to
I have no idea anyway so I'm going to
take this Jane and bronzer in the shade
inspire this is very like warm it's a
nice warm bronzer so I'm using this on
my ELF complexion brush to kind of warm
up my face I went very very soft on the
face I didn't want to do too much so I
did just a tiny bit of contouring and
then warming up the skin this is one of
my favorite blushes from NYX it's called
mauve and it's beautiful it goes with
pretty much any makeup look so I'm
adding very little of this to my cheeks
I didn't want to do too much because I'm
doing bold lips and bold eyes kind of
I'm just adding very little this is a
Coastal Scents
stippling brush and then I'm going to
use ELPS paint fantastic I want to look
crazy right there so I'm blending it out
this is a blush from ELF
but it's definitely a highlight in the
shade pink tastic I don't know if I
reason that's probably okay I'm
highlighting and then I put too much of
my nose and I was like whoa girl settle
down settle down blend that in and then
I'm going to finish up my eyes I'm going
to take more of that black eye shadow in
the shape anther from Wet n Wild and I'm
going to even out the outer be just a
little bit more
then I'm gonna add some mascara
oh no just getting on that this is easy
here la girls endless eyeliner in the
shade violet and I'm going to start
putting this on my waterline and a
little bit lower but I'm not going to
take it past my pupil I'm just taking it
in half way then I'm going to dip a
pencil brush into Bella mocha from
Milani and I'm gonna blend that I'm
gonna highlight underneath my brow bone
with this crown brushes brush that I got
in my Ipsy bag and I'm going to dip it
into elfs baked highlighter and pink
tastic and I'm going to highlight both
my brow bone and my inner corners with
this highlight now I'm going to put on
mascara this is the Revlon bold lacquer
roll luscious or something like that
bold lacquer mascara and I'm just loving
that on then I'm going to take this lip
liner from colour-pop in the shade loopy
air and I'm gonna apply this to my
entire lips and fill in my lips as well
this actually looks really pretty with
Lumiere lipstick like this look just
plain old Lumiere but I decided to take
it to the next level this is too too
from colour-pop it's a lipstick from
colour-pop bath called tutu and it's
very pigmented so what I'm doing is
stamping it onto my lips because as you
can see in the tube it's a very dark
lipstick but I wanted just like a hint
of that color so I'm just dipping on to
my
to get a little bit of color payoff not
too much and then that completes this
look thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
