my favorite drugstore slash affordable
makeup brushes I asked you guys it might
help health asked you guys in my elf
fall if you wanted to see a video like
this and a lot of you guys said yes so
that is what I'm doing today I have a
lot of affordable brushes that I
absolutely love I don't think that you
need to go out and spend a bunch of
money on brushes get me wrong there are
a couple of high-end brushes that I feel
like I can't live without but I really
don't think you need your entire brush
set to be Mac or Sigma or anything
really expensive like that don't get me
wrong I love those brands I think
they're great but there are affordable
options at the drugstore that work just
as well so like I said before I do have
a lot of them but I've narrowed them
down to my favorite 8 face brushes and
my favorite 8i brushes and out of all
the brushes I'm going to be talking
about today there are only four brands
in total my favourite cheap brushes all
not cheap as in quality but cheapest in
money my favourite inexpensive brands
for makeup brushes are Real Techniques
elf eco tools and morphe brushes I think
they are amazing and yeah let's jump
right in so I'm going to start off with
the face and I'm going to go in order as
to which you would apply your makeup I
think the best foundation brush isn't a
brush it is a sponge and I don't think
anything can beat the Real Techniques
miracle complexion Perfector no miracle
complexion sponge I'm not exactly sure
what the name of the sponges but it is
the only sponge real technique sells is
a $6 sponge you can get it at Real
Techniques calm or at selective
drugstores this is a great sponge it is
very comparable to the Beauty Blender
that is so highly talked about and the
Beauty Blender is $20 ever since I
bought this I really don't use my Beauty
Blender all that much I don't think
they're exact dupes I'm not going to lie
I think the beauty Bend the Beauty
Blender is just
little bit better because I feel like
this soaks up a little bit more
foundation than that one but for the
price I am NOT going to repurchase my
Beauty Blender I'm going to stick to
this I have a first one just to put on
my foundation personally I just think it
gives a more flawless finish and I just
recommend this sponge so much for anyone
for those of you who don't like to use
sponges to put on your foundation my
favorite foundation brush from the
drugstore is this one right here this is
also from Real Techniques and this is
the buffing brush this buffs in my
foundation beautifully I use this a lot
with my mineral makeup or tinted
moisturizers or anything that I feel
like using a brush with this is what I
go for this you can't buy it on its own
it does come in a set three of the
brushes besides this but it is under $20
I believe so for under $20 you do get
four brushes and I use all of them I
think they're great I'm actually going
to be talking about another one in that
set in just a few minutes but I prefer
this one over the expert face brush from
Real Techniques you can get the expert
face brush on its own you don't need to
buy it miss het but I think that this
applies foundation a little bit better
the other one can leave streak marks on
my face and this one doesn't do that
this just buffs in the foundation
amazingly well for my under-eye
concealer this is my holy grail brush
and it is also from Real Techniques and
it is their contour brush this is the
other brush I was talking about that
comes in the set with this the other two
brushes is like a lip brush that I use
all the time and then a foundation brush
like a traditional flat foundation brush
but this is the best brush to blend out
concealer underneath your eyes I'll just
dab some underneath my eyes and then
buff it out with this blend it in and it
just blends in flawlessly
I recommend this so badly if you're
having trouble blending your under-eye
concealer you can't get it to blend well
it's also really amazing for contouring
of course it gets right in the hollows
of the cheek bones it's a great contour
brush as well so I love this so I might
as well just show you my last favorite
Real Techniques brush for the face
because I mean why not and it is the
blush brush I love this brush
specifically for bronzer you can
absolutely use this for blush
I do sometimes when I want like a really
like light wash of blush I just blend it
really lightly on my cheeks and it works
like that but it is so great for
bronzing it is a perfect size to bronze
all over your face this is also really
good for powder you just dusted in your
powder and set your foundation with it
it's just an overall great brush this
the shape of it is what makes it so
unique and amazing okay so the next
brush I want to talk about is from
Ecotools and it is their tapered blush
brush this is a new recent discovery of
mine and I'm obsessed with it it what mo
makes it so special is the shape as you
can tell it's like a look kinda looks
like a paddle brush but then when you
turn it on its side it gets really thin
so it is tapered but then it comes to
like a nice point it's like pointy at
the top I don't know if you can tell but
I love this brush it's a great blush
brush you just Pat it into your brush on
its side and then pack it right on your
cheekbones and it applies blush
beautifully but I really love this for
contouring you just dip it into your
contour powder and get right in the
hollows of the cheekbones because it
comes to that really pointy tip you get
a really good chiseled contour with this
brush because it's so pointy I've also
heard a lot of people love this too dust
powder on their face because of its
shape it's just overall really great
brush and of course Ecotools is great
because they are environmentally
friendly I believe this is like recycled
I don't know what material says I forgot
but this is bamboo it's just a really
good brand cruelty-free and you know
they're eco-friendly so that's good and
then the last for face products that I
really love are from ELF all these
brushes are three dollars each so that's
great my holy grail F brush is my
complexion brush I use this all the time
actually used this today to bronze up my
face you could contour with it because
of its shape it is a tapered brush just
like the Ecotools one as you can see but
it's a little bit fluffier so you don't
get a super precise contour but it is
nice I mean a contour with it today
it's
a great brush for bronzer it's probably
one of my favorite brushes for bronzing
my face of all time out of all the
brushes I have and it's three dollars it
just gets right onto my large forehead
perfectly and it's just a really nice
easy brush my next favorite brush from
ELF is the small stipple brush this is a
great brush to add highlighter to the
face you just dip it into your product
and then stipple it on your cheekbones
and you get a beautiful highlight what's
so amazing about these little brushes is
that they're good for cream highlight as
well so I just put my cream product on
my hand and then swirl the brush in it
and then stipple it on my cheeks and you
get a perfect perfect application of
cream highlight and it's just really
great it's very comparable to the Mac
one Mac has a small stipple brush
exactly like this and honestly I really
can't tell the difference it's just a
great brush for that I also love using
this for cream contouring it just blends
out a cream contour so well I don't I
don't even know it's just a great great
brush and then the next two brushes I
want to talk about are fairly new to me
I just recently got them this month but
they are so good and I've been using
them non-stop the first one is the elf
small tapered brush I use this today to
set my under eye concealer I just dip it
in my powder and then lightly dab it
over my concealer and it just sets the
concealer so so well you can also use
this to highlight the cheekbones this is
just amazing it's really similar to the
Sigma one that everybody loves and it's
just a nice nice brush and then the
flawless concealer brush is also a
really good one Pat your concealer in
and it Pat's it in flawlessly and this
is also a great contour brush if you
want a really really chiseled like
strong contour this is a really really
good one because it's so small you get
right in the holes of cheekbones and
it's also great to contour the nose
because of its size just contour your
nose and it works really well it's also
really good for your eyes you can use
this as a crease brush I mean it's
really really large but if you want like
a fast neutral crease color you just dip
right in and swirl it in your crease and
it works that way too those were my
favorite face brushes they're all really
really really inexpensive by the way I
will link all the brushes down below
like all the websites that
can get these brushes at so now I'm
moving on to my favorite eye brushes the
first one is the elf eyeshadow see brush
I know that the elf one dollar line has
a really good shading brush like this
personally I haven't had good
experiences with the elf one dollar
brush line at all so I definitely
recommend all of these studio line
brushes they're just my favorite the $3
each and the other ones are one dollar
each so those are more affordable but
these are still really inexpensive and
they're the ones that I prefer they
don't shut on me and they hold up the
best the other ones shut on me a lot I
don't like the one dollar line this is a
great brush to pack the color on the lid
it works really well it's just a basic
shading brush and it's three dollars and
I think it is worth it the next three
brushes I really love are from Eagle
tools and two of them are double ended
so my next favorite is this one from
Ecotools
and it is their flat eyeliner brush I
love this brush to smudge really really
close to my lower lash line like to get
that really precise eyeshadow really
really close to your waterline this is a
great brush for that it's flat and it's
sharp but it is really really soft which
is why I like it to smudge underneath my
lash line
I don't like harsh brushes right
underneath the lash line because they
don't feel like they blend well and I
don't know this one is really really
soft even though it is like a sharp
straight you know square looking brush
it is really soft I also really love
this little duo set from Ecotools you
buy these together they come in like
eight set and they're really good you
get a shader brush a definer brush a
blending brush and a smudging brush so
your definer brush is just your basic
angled brush this is a great brush to do
your eyebrows with if you're into that
or to get right underneath the lower
lash line just like the other one then
you just have your basic shader brush on
the other end this is great for packing
on color onto the lid and it is really
really soft so you can also just kind of
dust some color into your crease as well
Ecotools brushes are like notorious for
being really soft
that's this brush and then this is the
other one that's amazing it has a
smudger brush on one end just so good
for smudging out I'll and I was
this is out apply like Maybelline master
drama eyeliner right here really close
to my lashes and then I'll get this
brush and smudge it and it does such a
good job of smoking out eyeliner this is
a great smudger brush because it's firm
but it's really soft too and then the
other side has this blending brush I
love this one because it's really
different from all the other ones that
I'm about to show you because it is
small it's a really really small
blending brush this is great for people
with small eyes or if you want to get a
really precise color in your crease like
a cut crease would be perfect with this
brush it's just so good because of its
size I love it definitely recommend this
set from Ecotools because you get four
brushes in one and it's really
inexpensive the only thing is that
storing them is a little bit difficult
but it's worth it in my opinion the next
brush I'm going to talk about is my Holy
Grail eyebrow brush and it is this one
right here from royal and langnickel I
got this at michaels for $2 and don't
exactly know what the name of it is but
it says ten wrote ten Roland link Nichol
that's all I know
but it's just a nice stiff brush you can
absolutely use a brush like this for
your eyebrows but I prefer one like this
because it is a lot harder and a lot
stiffer this is strictly for eyebrows
for me I can't really use this to smudge
underneath my lash line because it's so
stiff so it's just strictly my eyebrow
brush but ever since I bought this I
will not use any other brush on my
eyebrows it gives me a really sharp
square at the tip of my eyebrow and it's
just holy grail so the next three
brushes I want to talk about are from
the same brand and they're from morphe
brushes I just recently discovered this
brand and when I bought these I was like
wow these are great so the first one is
a fluffy brush and it is so great this
is the MV 23 this is so similar to the
Sigma e-40 that everybody loves that I
really love as well it's just a little
bit fluffier but I like that it just
bumps the color into your crease so well
I used it today to apply my crease shade
and it applied it like a friggin dream
also known on the website as the round
blender by the way and I believe this
brush is under $6 that is insane because
the quality is so impressive more if you
Rush's I have a bunch of them but since
I just started recently using them I
can't really sit here and tell you
they're my favorites but since I bought
these I haven't put them down so this is
just a great brush to apply your
transition shade it's basically what I
use it for and all the colors blend in
with it beautifully after I do that so I
highly highly recommend this one x1 from
them is this one right here and it is
the NV 13 this one reminds me a lot of
the Mac 217 brush the Mac 217 is
probably the only high-end brush that I
say nothing compares to and I will
continue to repurchase it if it ever
gets damaged but this is really similar
in terms of its shape it is tapered but
it's a lot fluffier I love this 2-pack
um color on the outer V and then bring
it into the crease this is an amazing
brush for that it's just your typical
blending brush that isn't so big and
fluffy and then the last brush I want to
talk about is the MB 25 and it is just a
round blending brush it blends your
concealer underneath your eyes really
well another thing it does is that it
kind of erases your mess-up I'm not
explaining it let's say you put
something in your crease but you put it
on too strong like your crease color
it's just a little bit too heavy this
does a really good job of like buffing
it away because it is a big fat round
brush but it's a little bit stiff when
you touch it so I love to use this when
I get a little bit too heavy-handed this
is just the perfect brush to just go in
there and blend that crease color this
is a really great blending brush
honestly with these three brushes from
morphe brushes you get the perfect
blown-out crease the perfect blend to
your eyeshadow with these new brushes
your eyes will be super beautifully
blended and it didn't even cost you that
much okay guys so those were my favorite
drugstore slash affordable makeup
