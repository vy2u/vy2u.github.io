requested one a highly requested one I'm
gonna be talking about all my favorite
products from colour-pop
I did a video just like this about a
year ago but since then they've brought
out so many new products like when I did
that video they didn't have any of the
lip glosses they didn't have the satin
lips I don't even think they had
eyeliners available all I know is that
since I've done this video I have fallen
in love with so many more products and
it's just been so requested to do this
video again so here I am I was actually
gonna post a makeup tutorial today when
you're watching this because I haven't
done a makeup tutorial in so long
and I want to jump back into the swing
of things but two nights ago I used my
glam glow dream do overnight face masks
that I've used a hundred times before
then I've even spoken about it in my
favorites video and when I woke up the
next day I had the worst skin irritation
ever you can't tell from far I'm not
sure you can tell in this video but when
I run my fingers over my face it
literally feels like a sidewalk imagine
putting your hand over a very bumpy
dirty sidewalk that's what my face feels
like I woke up and my face was so red
and I had tiny tiny microscopic little
bumps all over my entire face like every
inch of my face it's so bad and I'm on
day 2 and it still it's oh it even hurts
like my face hurts I'm giving it some
TLC and when my face comes down I will
film more makeup tutorials so until then
let's get into some color pop stuff so
I'm really good friends with my friend
Jordan from colour-pop and I had
mentioned to her that I wanted to do a
video like this because it was so
requested and I feel like I needed to
update you guys and I have such a great
relationship with the people over at
color pop especially Jordan and they
thought it was a good idea to give you
guys a 20% off on all of my favorite
color pop stuff it's not a code or
anything but if you go on the colour-pop
website I will link it down below
there's gonna be like a little tab that
says like Kathleen's favorites or
something like that and all of these
products will be listed under that tab
all of these specific products will be
20% off which I thought it was so nice
they didn't have to do that I just
mentioned I was going to film this video
and they thought it would be nice to
give you guys 20
and off its a very limited time though
it will only be available for four days
so if you're watching this on the day I
upload today is Monday and it will last
for days okay so let's jump in I'm
actually going to start off with my
all-time favorite color pop product ever
and it is their ultra satin lips I feel
like it's a mix between a regular
lipstick and a liquid lipstick they do
dry down like a liquid lipstick but they
don't get completely matte they feel
very moisturizing very hydrating they're
not as drying as their ultra matte lips
it has a satin finish like this ultra
satin lip you know make sense I love
it's my favorite thing they've ever
created and I have a few colors that I
really really love I will say some of my
must-haves and some of my all-time
favorites I couldn't really include in
this video because they were either
discontinued or there were limited
editions there were so many eyeshadows
so many lipsticks so many products that
I still used to say that I completely
loved but I didn't want to mention them
because you can't get them I thought
that would be kind of mean you know so I
love all of the ultra satin lip there is
not one color I don't like I love them
all but these are my favorites of course
I had to talk about these three right
here these are the ones that I created
with color pop you've seen me talk about
these 100 times so I don't want to go
into too much detail November is a very
beautiful like rosy everyday pink shade
it's such a nice rosy color like a
flower I don't know I really really love
November and then there's Alyssa which
is less pink than November it's a little
bit lighter if I could think of the
perfect pink lipstick like my everyday
pink that has a little bit of nude in
there I always grab Alyssa and then my
favorite out of the three is actually
point zero which I feel like this is
everyone's least favorite out of these
three I love it I wear this one the most
out of all of them I wear it in a lot of
my videos I feel like point zero just
looks so cool I mean that's the only way
I could describe it it's a brown but
it's not as deep as your typical brown
lipstick it's a little bit lighter and
it's more cool toned it's a very cool
tone lip actually I love this with just
about any eye look honestly cool tone
looks and warm tone eye looks I love
point 0 it's my favorite and then the
other ultra satin lips I love are these
these two are my first loves these were
the colors that I tried first from there
Saten range and I wore these non-stop
this one in magic one is probably the
one that I wore the most when I first
tried these out the writing is
completely rubbed off on this because I
used to throw it in my purse I used to
wear all the time it's such a beautiful
nude it's a nude but it has a little bit
of a peach undertone it looks good with
every single I look Echo Park is similar
it's also a nude but it's a little bit
deeper and a little bit less peachy a
little bit more pinkish I also really
love this one in the shade of freaking
frack I'm showing you like very nude
shades but for some reason in this
formula
I love how nudes look the satin lips
make nude colors look beautiful and
freaking frack isn't it not a nude for
me it's a little bit deeper but it could
be a nude for deeper skin tones this one
is amazing it reminds me a lot of Kat
Von D's Lolita only prettier less patchy
so much better I love this color so much
and then they last ultra satin lip I
want to talk about is this one in the
shade panda I don't typically wear
colors like this I very rarely do I wear
these intense berry shades but this one
is so beautiful
every time I wear it I'm like oh my gosh
I need to wear this more often I love
how this looks on everyone I just think
is so flattering and so fun at the same
time like it's a berry but it's not too
neon now I'm going to talk about their
old truck glossy lips they have ultra
satin lips ultra glossy lips and ultra
matte lips they're all in this packaging
but obviously they're all different
they're ultra glossy lips are really
really awesome they come in different
finishes they have the sheer lip glosses
they have cream lip glosses they're a
little bit more pigmented they have
metallic ones the sheer ones are my
personal favorite because they're just
so easy I don't want any lipstick this
one is my Holy Grail this one is the
best one if I could only pick one lip
gloss from colour-pop it would be this
one this is the shade of fairy floss
I've used this so much I'm surprised I'm
not like almost out of this this looks
good on anything nude if I'm wearing a
nude lipstick that's a little bit too
matte I will throw this on and it just
it's just it's perfection the undertone
in this is so beautiful it's like not
too pink not so nude not too peachy
it's like perfect and the other sheer
finish that I really love as well is
this one
Korona when I first saw it I was like oh
that's not going to be my color because
it's too pink for me but because it's a
sheer finish it just looks so pretty I'm
actually wearing this lip gloss on top
of a lip liner right now and I love it
it gives it a little something extra
without being too pink like the pink
barely shows up but it gives you a
little bit of something I will say
though that these are not very very long
wearing you're gonna have to reapply
throughout the day I feel that way about
most lip glosses but especially the
sheer finishes there's something you're
gonna want to keep reapplying and then
my other favorite lip gloss from the
line is Finders Keepers I love this
paired with Lumiere lippy stick the
cream finishes are way more pigmented
than the sheers but they still have a
really pretty glossy look to them they
just do not need a lipstick underneath
it's like you can totally wear these on
its own and it still gives you full
opaque color with a nice glossy finish
the sheer ones I would recommend wearing
at least a lip liner underneath but
Finders Keepers is definitely one for
you if you like opaque glossy lips in
this color like I said I like applying
just a little bit of this on top of
Lumiere if I want Lumiere to be glossy
such a beautiful like purpley mauve
shade I love it it's my favorite cream
finish that they have so yeah so let's
move on to the ultra matte lips because
I only have two to share with you guys I
will save the lippie stix for later just
so we're not like only talking about lip
products so these two are my current
favorite ultra matte lips in the
collection so the first one being a
Lumiere 2 it was so funny because it was
so requested to make this shade after
Lumiere came out and they released ultra
matte lips I was getting messages almost
on a daily basis like oh my gosh please
create Lumiere in an ultra matte lid I
don't know what it was about it but
everyone wanted to see Lumiere in an
ultra matte lip so this came this baby
right here it's not exactly the same
it's a little bit deeper it's a little
bit more purple and I love it I actually
love this no I wouldn't say a little bit
more than the mirror I don't know I kind
of do a little bit I like the color a
little bit more than Lumiere I love me
some Lumiere too and the other ultra
matte lip that I love so much is this
one in the shade mama I love this for a
few different reasons I love this
because it's orange and orange is my
favorite lip color to wear of all time
it's an orange but it's more of a burnt
orange and but it's kind of bright
the same time if you guys are familiar
with Miami fever by Oprah it's a little
bit more Orange
I also really love it because it's
called mama which is my name to my
entire family if you guys didn't know
that every single person in my family
refers to me as mama they do not call me
Kathleen it would be weird to hear my
family call me Kathleen honestly I never
understood why they named me Kathleen
with my mom being as Cuban as she is I
don't know but anyway I love it I love
the name I love the color okay so let's
move on to eyeshadows I feel like this
video is going to be like a million
years long I need to speed this up as
most of you know colour-pop makes
amazing eye shadows got to give a shout
out to my first babies right here this
is the where the light is quad that I
created with colour-pop there's a creamy
vanilla shade in the quad called glow
this one is brand new I went through my
old one I use this to highlight my brow
bone or my inner corners it's matte
there's this shade right here which is
called Cornelius which is a really
pretty everyday transition shade it's
also matte it has such a pretty
undertone I love this transition shade
and then there are two more fun colors
this really pretty bronze shade called
blaze has a little bit of glitter
throughout it and then there's this
shade in the quad which is called
kathleenlights I don't know why I named
it kathleenlights
I don't know but it's a really stunning
gold with a little bit of orange in
there it's like a very warm very warm
warm warm gold and then my other quad
that I created with colour-pop is also
20% off for four days if you guys want
to check them out this is the quad
called where the night is it's in the
black packaging I think this is my
favorite quad that I created I love the
original one but this one is so cool I
have this shade right here which is
called Porter it's a very reddish
burgundy it's pretty much matte but it
has tiny little flecks of glitter in it
really really beautiful on the lower
lash line I have this shade called
weenie which is a stunning metallic rose
gold really really pretty it's a little
bit more pink than the typical rolls
goals and then I have this one in the
shade telepathy which is probably the
most unique eyeshadow in my collection
it's like a metallic chartreuse kind of
yellow-green so so insane and then this
color in the shade midnight which is a
deep blackened almost green but not
really green like a deep black with a
cracked
and of little flecks throughout it those
were the eye shadows that I collab with
color pop that of course are my
favorites but I have a few to share with
you from there regular line so my first
favorite I think this is my favorite
color pop I showed of all time I'm even
saying that I like this more than my
eyeshadows like I wish I would have
created this I love it so much is in the
shade waddles and it looks like your
average pinky nude brown color but it is
stunning I love how this color looks all
over the lid whenever I use this that's
all I do I just put it on my entire lid
some eyeliner and I'm good to go I love
this shade it's just so feminine and so
pretty next up is a color that I
probably mentioned in my last color pop
favorites video you're gonna see a lot
of repeats because there are still
things that I currently love so much but
game face is just one of those colors I
will always go back to it's similar to
kathleenlights only way way way way more
orange you can see the difference here
kathleenlights is this one it's a little
bit more gold this one is like a
metallic orange bronze shade I don't
know it's so beautiful all over the lid
in the summertime mmm this colors
delicious another favorite of mine is
this one in the shade elixir you're
going to notice that a lot of these
colors are warm eyes shadows I just I
really love warm toned eyeshadows and I
didn't want to include other eyeshadows
that were a little bit more cool toned
if they weren't my true on his favorites
so forgive me for that but this shade
and elixir is beautiful I love this
color in the crease I use this with a
fluffy synthetic brush this is the
morphe 27 it's like a synthetic crease
brush and little by little I'll just
start applying this into the crease I'll
both of the color and it looks so
beautiful this is actually the color I
have all over my crease another favorite
of mine isn't necessarily my favorite
because I think it's anything out of
this world but I love the name it's
called Central Perk which if you know me
you know that friends is my all-time
favorite show like nothing compares I
love Central Perk I love friends and I
have this eyeshadow smudged underneath
my lower lash line today and I love it
for that I never really used this color
on my lid believe it or not I always use
it to smudge out my lower lash line when
you swatch it a lot of the purple really
comes out and it looks so cool and smoky
on the lower lash line another favorite
of mine is this one in the shade muse
this is another like newer favorite for
me
using this one kind of like an eyeshadow
topper I'll just take some on my finger
like when I'm done with my makeup and if
I want a little bit more off to the look
if I'm wearing like a warm I look I'll
just start stamping this on my eye and I
feel like it makes the look come
together it's very similar to we nee
only we need is more rose gold this one
is a little bit more reddish so my next
favorite is a nice shadow I have been
using since I discovered color pop I've
gone through like two of these this eye
shadow is called mittens and if you've
been following me for a really long time
you might know that I love this so much
I love this on my lower lashline I love
this all over my entire lid I actually
have this all over my lid today and then
I applied muse on top with my finger and
that's mainly what I use it for I always
use it as like an eyeshadow base and if
you have green eyes or hazel eyes I
would highly recommend mittens I know it
looks like so dark but the red
undertones really really show up on your
eyes I don't typically love the matte
finish I shadow I will say that there
metallic shades or shimmery shades are
way better but mittens is like amazing
next up is this bad boy right here it's
the only colorful eyeshadow but I have
to share with you guys and it is in the
shade coconut if you like blue eye
shadow you need coconut in your life
this is the most beautiful ocean I don't
even know how to describe it in the
light it looks like super blue but then
in other lights it almost looks like an
indigo oh my gosh I don't know I love
this eyeshadows so much I've only worn
it like five times but for a blue
eyeshadow that's a lot that's a lot of
times
tomber eyeshadows to share with you and
then we will jump into some eyeliners
this one is called la la I know for a
fact that I spoke about this in my last
best of colour-pop video because I have
loved this bad-boy for a long time this
is my second one this color is the most
beautiful rose gold ever it's also
similar to weeny only it's more golden
weeny is more pink can you tell well
they look very similar now that I'm
looking at them but they're not they're
different I promise
this one is la la and this one is weeny
I love wearing this with a little bit of
a brown crease color and then putting
this on my entire lid and it's like so
beautiful this looks so stunning with
waddles also I love it I love it I love
this color but every time I pick this up
or I applies to my eye I have the
freaking Ashley Simpson song in my head
and then the last I shadow I want to
talk about is in their limited edition
holiday packaging which by the way I'm
very into color pop I love this black
packaging we should discuss this because
I really really like this it's in their
limited edition packaging but this color
is permanent you're looking for a bronze
with a crap ton of glitter in it
definitely look too thirsty girl I like
this even more than I like my eyeshadow
blaze this is blaze on steroids it's
nicer it is it's so much nicer get this
thirsty girl is seriously amazing if
you're into really brown warm bronzy
eyes you need thirsty girl in your life
like you need it okay so let's talk
about some eyeliners because color pop
makes my favorite eyeliners of all time
they make the best colored eyeliners
when it comes to black and brown I do
prefer my NYX
pleasure Lee eyeliners but when it comes
to color color pop just so it's just so
they're the best my favorite of all time
has to be mr. bang of course cuz it's
the one that I created I love the shade
it's what I'm wearing on my waterline
right now it's a brown but it's a very
very warm brown it has kind of like a
red undertone this just really makes
your eyes pop call me is also another
really great one it's a brown but it's a
very very deep deep deep Brown it's not
your typical Brown and it kind of has a
little bit of a red undertone as well or
like a purpley undertone but very slight
it's so stunning this one is also really
amazing this is in the shade honey dude
if you're looking for a new to just
apply to your waterline to make your
eyes look bigger you need this in your
life it's just a nude eyeliner and I
feel like it's a necessity for some of
us and then out of there like really
colorful ones these three are my
favorite favorite favorite this one in
the shade get paid is such a beautiful
metallic copper but it has a little bit
of rose gold mixed in there as well I
love this color so much I love it on the
waterline I love it really close to the
water line and just smudged on the lower
lash line I think it is beautiful I
think it's fun to have a metallic
waterline every once in a while and if
you're in the market for a green
eyeliner and if you're in the market for
a blue eyeliner look no further these
are amazing
this one teaspoon is so freakin good
whenever I wear any sort of green
eyeshadow anywhere on my eyes I usually
will wear a teaspoon on my waterlines
because I feel like it pairs so nicely
with green eyeshadow it's a stunning
color the same goes for this blue one
this one is in the shade beasting and it
is the most intense most like eye
catching blue ever they seriously stay
on my waterline they don't go anywhere
they're amazing
gosh I gosh I don't think I've ever said
that word but anyway I love their
eyeliners okay so let's talk about some
highlights I have four to share with you
so the first one is called lunch money
this is such a beautiful highlight I
attempted to use it today on my face but
there was so much texture that I applied
like this much cuz I don't want to
highlight all the bumps on my face but
this one is a very light gold it's a
very white gold but it works for the
fairest of skin really really beautiful
on the cheeks next up is smoking
whistles this one has tiny little flecks
of glitter lunch money doesn't this one
does but it's not like glittery I don't
like glittery highlights it doesn't look
Glary on your face it just looks like
extremely highlighting it's a very light
shade but it does have a slight pink
undertone and then this one is also
amazing this one is in the shade wisp
very very similar to Becca's highlight
in the shade opal they're like dead-on
dupes it's stunning I can't wear this
unless I do have self 10 because it
looks a little bit too gold on my face
it's such a pretty highlight so
beautiful and then the last highlight I
have to talk about is my newest one but
I love it this one is called flexitarian
and this one has a lot of glitter in it
as well but it doesn't look glittery
like it doesn't look chunky that's what
it is it doesn't look chunky on the skin
you can tell with this one that there is
like glitter you know like little
glitter particles but it's so fine that
it doesn't look bad I love this
especially from my inner corners it
looks so so freakin beautiful I would
recommend this one if you have like
light to fair skin okay and then the
last category is lippie stix which is
what initially made me fall in love with
color pop last time I filmed this video
I don't think they're matte X formula
was introduced no it wasn't that's
pretty new which is like their matte
formula but
on another level on another level the
Matt X formula makes their matte
lipsticks look like not matte some of
them are very drying on me some of them
I do not like but for the most part most
of them are amazing they are super super
super matte and they last all day and
they're fabulous let me talk about those
first since I'm sitting here raving
about them the first one is chateau
which I feel like I've spoken about
recently a lot it's probably my favorite
matte X lipstick they have it's a very
very blackened red it's like a black
cherry so beautiful for the holidays and
then this one in the shade trust me was
like their first release like they
introduced the matte ex formula with
this lipstick and it is a red but it's
like a pinky red it has like a slight
pink undertone it's so beautiful and any
last matte ex lippy I have to talk about
is poppin which is the most beautiful
pink ever it's like a deep magenta pink
it's so girly it's so fun this with like
a really bold winged eyeliner it looks
so cool I love this color and then
there's these lipsticks which are their
original formulas I realized that all of
these are matte except one I really like
matte lips so I want to give a quick
little mention to my babies right here
these are the three lipsticks that I
created with color pop to Matt's and one
cream which I think this is my most used
colour-pop lippie stick of all time this
is in the shade Aquarius it's definitely
my most worn out of all of my collabs
fourth color pop this is the color I
wear the most this end point zero
believe it or not I just I wear these so
much it's such a beautiful pinky nude
and it being a cream finish just makes
it look so shiny and so like yummy and I
have tarus which is a matte lip II stick
and this one is a very beautiful warm
brown on medium to deep skin tones it'll
probably come off as like a nudie color
on me it's a little bit deeper and then
of course my baby
I want Aquarius more than this but this
over ever hold and number one spot in my
heart this is my first collab ever
this is Lumiere it's a matte finish and
it is the perfect mauve color it's mauve
with a little bit of purple but I mean I
feel like this color looks different on
everyone it's one of those shades that
really
on your lip color and depending on your
skin tone it's just gonna look so
different
and then these colors I love so much so
much they're all like in the red family
hmm
well this one's pretty Brown this one is
in the shade grunge it's another Matt
Cooke all of these are matte I love this
it's a brown but it's almost like a
burgundy brown but like a light Burgundy
I feel like this color is really hard to
explain it does look very grungy though
like if I can think of the perfect 90s
lip I immediately think of grunge so
fallen wintery I love this shade this
color and Frenchie is like my favorite
red lipstick that color pop creates it's
a firetruck red it has like a slight
coral undertone like very slight but
it's very bold it's like a very loud in
your face red I've worn this so much
it's so beautiful and then I have the
shade click which is another must-have
for me whenever I think of the perfect
red orange click is the first thing that
comes to my mind it's a red but it has a
strong orange undertone it looks so
beautiful in the summer seriously if you
guys don't have click and you love like
red oranges you need it and then the
last one I want to talk about is chichi
I don't know why I said it like that but
this is a super orange lip you can tell
the difference between click and chichi
this one is like orange it's very orange
it actually reminds me a lot of Maxim
orange or more inge however you're
supposed to say that it's pretty much
like almost the same I love it so much
more
I love Gigi okay guys so that completes
this video these were all of my
must-haves color pop products I didn't
mention any of the lip liners even
though I really really love them because
I thought that this would it would make
the video even longer than it already is
and I thought it would be like
unnecessary but I love the matching lip
liners to all of these lippie stix so if
I mention they Libby stick in this video
the lip liner will also be 20% off when
you go on the website just to give you
guys a heads up cuz I love their lip
liners as well but I do want to give an
honorable mention that looks like it's
been through the wringer mine is like
yellow and banged up this is the lip
liner in the shade skimpy it's my
favorite color pop lip liner ever and I
don't really like the skimpy lippy stick
