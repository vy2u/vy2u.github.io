a highly highly requested one I'm gonna
talk about all my favorite color pop
products you guys know that I've been
doing like a makeup stash series here on
my channel where I show you guys all my
blushes and bronzers and I'm going
through my entire collection and a lot
of you guys are like hey when you spoke
about blushes you didn't speak about any
of the color pop ones and things like
that
because I was planning on doing this
whole color pop video I'm not going to
show you every single color pop item I
own I'm going to show you what I think
are the best ones and I think that this
video would be more helpful that way so
these are literally my favorite color
pop products I'm gonna link color pops
website down below this video is not
sponsored you know that I work really
closely with color pop since I created
my own lippie Stix and eyeshadows so
they always like send me goodie bags
with their new products and stuff like
that but if you saw my first ever color
pop video i swatched a bunch of lippie
stix on my mouth i had purchased like
half of those things actually made it a
point to only show you guys things that
are currently permanent because there
are a couple of eyeshadows that I really
love but they were from collections that
are either leaving really soon we're
already left like a lot of the Christmas
things so all the products I'm gonna be
sharing with you guys are available
right now for you to purchase if you
want to or for you to check out they're
not limited edition or anything like
that
oh and before I get started I know I
keep rambling but before I get started I
want to tell you guys that for a limited
time actually let me check the date I
know that it's the 19th already but I
have told you guys this on Instagram and
Twitter if you don't follow me on
Instagram or Twitter you should because
I update you guys in certain things all
the time so starting June 15th which was
Monday all the way through June 30th the
last day of this month I have a coupon
code to share with you guys so for 15
days only you can use the coupon code
kathleenlights all in lowercase and it
gives you five dollars off your entire
order which doesn't seem much but it's a
free eyeshadow or a free lippy stick or
free shipping if you're in the u.s. so
do not forget to use the coupon go to b4
you can't anymore so before the 30th of
this
month all lowercase don't forget and I
cannot wait for a cut about to start
shipping completely internationally like
to the UK and everything right now it's
just the US and then like New Zealand
and Australia for now I think so yeah
take advantage of the coupon code now
let's get on with the video okay so in
my opinion the creme de la creme of
colour-pop lies within their eyeshadows
and their Libby Stix I think those are
the top-notch products that they have
okay so let's get started with lippie
stix
i have 6 to share with you guys I have
so many of their Libby's but these six
are my all-time favorite and keep in
mind guys that this is just my opinion
you might not like some of these colors
you might not like some of the
eyeshadows I'm going to show you maybe
they don't look good against your skin
tone but these are just my favorite
products I'm not going to be swatching
these on my lips because it's gonna be
crazy it's gonna be crazy but I plan on
doing a full lip swatch video with all
of the lippies I own and I own like
literally like 45 or 50 it's insane but
I'm going to split it up like in two
days and I'm going to swatch all of the
ones I own on my lips because I think it
would be a cool video and I think you
guys would enjoy it but these are my six
favored ones this one is in the shade
cookie it's a matte finish the matte
finishes are definitely hands-down my
favorite finishes that color pop has I
like it because it's not straight-up
brown it has like a pinky undertone it's
perfect for every day these smell
phenomenal I love the way that these
lippy 6 smell I'm not going to be
talking about lippy pencils like they're
lip they're matching lip liners because
each lippy stick comes with its matching
lip liner and their lip liners are great
so you know but anyway I love this color
for every single day it's beautiful it
actually was in a limited edition
addiction it was actually in a limited
edition set but everybody loved it so
much that they decided to keep it
permanent and I'm so glad that they did
my next favorite is this one and this
one is called Lumiere and I love it I am
a little biased because this is the lip
color that I created with colour-pop
it's a really pretty purple II moth but
not too purple it's not like a purple
it's like a mob ish dusty color really
like it I think it looks so pretty on so
many of you
I just wanted to mention it because it's
really beautiful and I think it's good
definitely one of my favorites but I
mean can you blame me of course it's one
of my favorites so this next color I'm
obsessed with it's also a matte finish
and it's in the shade Tootsie I love
this because it's a nude but it's like a
grayish it has like a Mavi undertone
almost grey it's like a nude that's
almost like a grape under what I'm doing
this but it's like a purplish gray one
of those news that I think is really
really on trend right now okay so this
is my all-time favorite one like out of
all the 48 or however many I have this
is hands-down my all-time favorite lippy
from colour-pop it's probably one of my
favorite lipsticks in the entire world
oh my god I realized that all of these
are matte oh wow
all of the lippies i'm sharing with you
are matte I'm so so sorry it's just that
the matte ones are my favorite because
they're not drying and they almost don't
even feel like a matte they kind of have
a little bit of a shine to them not a
shine but they're just so comfortable
they're like the creamiest mattes there
anyway this is in the shade clique and I
love this because it's a really pretty
vibrant red with an orange undertone
I've worn it so many times it looks like
I've barely touched it but I love it
it's perfect for the summer time because
it has like that hot tamale nough stew
it it's so like spicy and you know I
love this lipstick this one is a really
fun one but I find that it is super
super long wearing all of these are but
I was so impressed the first time I used
this that it's definitely one of my
favorites this one's called grind again
I'm at finish and it's a really vibrant
like purple but almost in like a neon
way it's super eye-catching so if you're
not into like flashy lip colors you will
not like this but if you want a vibrant
purple then this is the one to go for
and then this is another one that I am
so obsessed with this one is amazing
this one's called Frenchie it's matte
and it's the lipstick I'm wearing right
now it is a true fire truck engine neon
red a true freakin it's amazing it is
I love rides like this where they're
just like they look like neon homos it's
vibrant it's beautiful and if you're
into red lips Frenchie will be your girl
doesn't make your teeth look yellow so
those are the six lippies I highly
recommend that really really really have
not let me down right so now I'm going
to talk about highlighters because color
pop makes amazing highlighters I have a
for to share with you they have a ton of
different colors and what I love is that
they have a bunch of different
highlighters for different skin tones
like there's even a highlighter that
looks like a straight-up blush on my
skin like a dark blush because obviously
it's too dark for me so it would be
perfect for deeper skin tones these are
four of my personal favorite you cannot
go wrong with these I'm going to start
with my favorite one this one is so
beautiful this one is called lunch money
it is the one that I've used the most
out of all of the color pop highlighters
it's a beautiful white gold like when
you apply it to your skin it reflects so
much of that pale gold like your cheeks
look really really intense and almost
wet looking my favorite way to apply
colour-pop highlighters is with a sponge
by the way like I just like sponge it on
like dududududu and yeah this next one
is called wisp and I feel like the
majority of the people would really
really love this color it's the
highlight I am wearing on my cheekbones
right now it's intense it's amazing all
of these color pop highlighters are
intense which is how I like them but
they're buildable you can actually apply
a really soft like layer to the skin
which is a beautiful gold that does have
kind of like a bronzy undertone so it's
not like pale it's not like a very like
bright color it's just a beautiful gold
I love it I love it lasts forever on the
skin as well like these highlights like
once I set like de oz on my face forever
another one I love is smoking whistles
this one is super super intense though
like I only recommend this for like
light/medium to fair skin tones it's
that intense even more intense than
lunch money and while lunch money has
that pale gold to it this one has more
of like a light champagne color like
almost a little bit pinkier this one is
another one that I love when I am tan it
just looks so
on my skintone when I'm a little bit
tanner it's called butterfly beach it's
actually not super intense it's not
crazy it's a little bit more subtle and
the other ones I showed you but like
with a tan it just reflects like a
really nice bronzy peachy glow to the
cheeks okay so those were my favorite
highlighters of a bunch I love the
highlights they're intense and they're
amazing
definitely try out the highlights if
you're in to that like whoa you have a
little bit kind of an eye so I don't
have any of the bronzers to share with
you today I recently got the bronzers
and I haven't like use them enough to
tell you like okay these are really good
or they're not so good I have to use
them a little bit more I've only used
like one of the shades a couple of times
so I don't even know if the other ones
like are as good I just don't know so I
will update you on the bronzers a little
bit later since I don't have a favorite
I don't want to lie and be like oh this
one's good I don't have a favorite
bronzer so I didn't include it okay so
before I get into the eyeshadows because
I have a few to talk about I'm gonna
show you my favorite blushes and
coincidentally I also have four favorite
blushes it was in the shade trickery
it's a really really soft peach this
looks so pretty in the springtime for
some reason I am obsessed with the way
that they smell they don't even smell
like they don't smell like I don't know
I really like it it's like a peachy pink
looks really nice in the springtime and
in the summer time it just makes it just
gives your face like a nice soft peachy
touch because it's not too intense it's
not crazy over-the-top but you could
definitely build it up my favorite way
to apply these is also with the Beauty
Blender or actually my all-time favorite
way is with this brush right here this
is from morphe it's there 8:34 i like it
because it works really well with cream
products even though this is not a cream
this is like a moosie texture it works
really well and I like to tap this
product on my cheek I have noticed with
these blushes they don't work extremely
well if you're trying to like blend it
in like a regular blush because of the
formula it works best if you just like
tap it on your cheek if you tap it on
your cheek you get the perfect color
payoff and the perfect finish it's not
splotchy or anything so yeah I love
triggering and this is a satin finish by
the way all of the highlighters are
mentioned are pearlized finishes this
next one is really similar to trickery
only like a few shades darker this one
is in the shade bonus it's a true peach
but more of a darker peach I really love
warmer colors I love peach blush this is
the matte finish and it just looks
stunning with like a chocolaty smokey
eye it's beautiful this next one is
probably my favorite favorite favorite
favorite out of all of them it's called
between the sheets it's a matte finish
and it's just like a true nude almost
has a little bit of a modest kind of
undertone it's the blush I'm wearing on
my cheeks right now I don't know if you
can tell for some reason on camera you
can't tell as much as in person but it's
so beautiful this color of course pairs
with every single makeup look and then
my last favorite is birthday suit this
one is kind of like a nude as well but
it's more of a purpley pinky nude it's
not too intense is what I'm trying to
say it's a satin finish so it has a
little bit of a sheen to it not much but
it just pairs well with cool tone looks
because of that purplish kind of
undertone I really like it those are my
favorite highlighters and those are my
favorite blushes
the ones that I actually grabbed more
than any of the other ones I own now
let's talk about a shadows which is my
other favorite thing from colour-pop
besides the lippie stix so I really
couldn't narrow it down to like not even
five I'm gonna talk about ten shadows
and while I love all of colourpop's
other matte stuff I find that they're
like glittery or like shimmery
eyeshadows are amazing I really love
their matte ones as well a lot of people
complain that they can't really blend
them out but if you use a synthetic
brush you can blend it out the matte
ones are not hard to work with I
actually really love using my color pop
shadows with this is a wave a brush it's
their concealer buffer you just need
like one of those like synthetic brushes
and they work so remember I am only
talking about eyeshadows that you can
get seperately I'm not talking about any
eyeshadows that come in a kit or in a
Quan so I'm not going to be showing you
like my where the light is eyeshadows or
anything like that these are just
individual eyeshadows you can purchase
for five dollars each let's talk about
my all-time
favorite it is in the shade sequin and
it's a metallic finish this is a true
rose gold I'm almost about to hit pan on
this it's so intense it's really
metallic but it kind of has little bits
of glitter in it as well this shines on
the lid like no other and the rest are
in no particular order I love all of
these the same it is also kind of a rose
gold funny to think about it's called
Lala and even though it is like a rose
gold as well sequin is a little bit more
pink with like glitter enos to it it's a
rose gold that pushes more pink and
glittery this one is a little bit more
gold and it is a ultra metallic finish
so it's like a complete sheen on the lid
it's actually the eyeshadow I'm wearing
right now on top of a different
eyeshadow
it's a muta miss and love this one this
one is called on the rocks
and it's actually the eyeshadow I am
wearing underneath Ella right now it's
just a pure chocolaty bronze with a ton
of gold glitter throughout it it's a
metallic finish it just looks stunning
when you pack it on the lid like you
really have to pack this one on to get
the full glittery metallic finish but
when you do this chocolaty it's
delicious this one is actually a matte
finish and it's my favorite matte
eyeshadow from colour-pop it's actually
one of my favorite eyeshadows ever
it's called mittens and I actually did a
whole video on like a whole tutorial
using just this eyeshadow on my lid once
it's a unique Brown to me like to me I
don't have any other eyeshadow that
looks like this because it's like dark
chocolatey Brown but it has purpley
undertone little purple a little red of
an undertone I don't know the finish is
really really beautiful I like it
because if you apply a really soft layer
you really get that like purpley red
look but if you pack it on it gets like
even chocolatier so it's actually have
this on my lower lash line today and on
my outer V of the eye a little bit this
one is another one that I literally
actually I have I have hit pan on this
you can barely tell but I have this one
is called smash
and I actually don't even know the
finish of it because it doesn't say it
it was one of the first color pop
eyeshadows I ever got it's a really
pretty soft topi gold a lot of people
will look at this and be like oh there's
not much to this eyeshadow but I
disagree this is one of those colors
that look amazing as a wash of color
like just put this on your entire lid
all the way up to the crease even blend
it in the crease a little bit because
it's not metallic it's not glittery it's
just a sheen like a true sheen this one
is a fun one that I actually really love
I don't do too many colors on my lids
that much but this one is good this
one's called BAE and it's blue in some
lights but then it's purple in other
lights it is a metallic finish I love
the metallic finishes I guess when you
apply it on the lid the blue glitter
really really stands out you gotta pack
it on the lid but when you do the blue
glitter stands out it looks beautiful
under like a blue base or a purple base
it's one of those fun clubbing or like
smoky colorful eyeshadows it's so pretty
this one is another matte one that I
really love this one's called to play
and I love this because it's like a true
khaki it's like a tannish orange II kind
of tan it's the color I have in my
crease today like this is such a
beautiful transition shade when you're
dealing with really warm eyeshadows I
highly recommend play this one is get
lucky it's one of my first color pop I
chose as well it's a true pure metallic
intense gold there's no other way to put
it it's an ultra metallic finish which
means it's even more shiny more like
intense and this is a straight up gold
which is why I like it it's a true gold
it's not too bronzy it's not too yellow
it's not like a yellow Eagle it's just a
gold if you're into cranberry colors you
will love this like reddish colors you
know I am I love warm neutrals if you
already can't tell this is in the shade
drift it's a pure pure cranberry shade
it's a paralized finish so it's not
going to be like metallic or too intense
you could even apply this really light
to the crease because it doesn't have a
ton of glitter but it looks beautiful
all over the lid it's a perfect holiday
eyeshadow I love this during like
Thanksgiving II like October November
December I love it during the holidays
it's such a beautiful cranberry shade
then my last favorite is another like
must-have in my opinion it's called
game face a lot of people have asked me
if it's similar to kathleenlights but
this one is a lot more orange this is
like a true orange with a little bit of
gold and ice does have that orange
undertone but this one is like orange
which I love that about it it's
beautiful so that completes this video
