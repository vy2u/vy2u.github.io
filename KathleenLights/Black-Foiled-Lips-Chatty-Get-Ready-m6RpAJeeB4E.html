chatty get ready I haven't done one of
these videos in a while and I have a
bunch of new makeup that I just recently
got that I have not tried out yet so
we're gonna do that together we're gonna
try this on camera I'm gonna be chatting
with you guys while I get ready and
trying new products first impressions
I'm excited I recently bought a bunch of
new of products on the elf website like
a bunch of stuff I've never tried before
so I'm gonna use a couple of those
things plus other brands as well and
surprisingly enough I don't have my
eyebrows on today I'm sure you guys have
noticed but I never ever ever do my
brows on camera I have a couple of brow
routines like up on my channel but I
just skipped them I always do them first
because I take so long to do my brows
and since I do the same thing every
single time I don't like to include them
in tutorials but really quickly I'm just
gonna do my brows this is the elf shape
end-state wax pencil in clear I'm just
gonna try this on the rice I'm going to
apply this before I apply my brow
product just to kind of tame them down
I'm going to use new benefit products on
my brows this isn't new this is the
benefit gimme brow I am in the shade 3
in all of the new benefit brow products
so I'm going to take the precisely my
brow pencil and just fill in my brows
and then go over it with the benefit
gimme brow
okay so now I have my brows on that wax
I can't really tell but definitely good
job so I already have the look in mind
like what I want to do I want to do
something a little bit more dramatic
with lips and then something very you
know natural on the eye I got this elf
aqua primer mist so I'm gonna try that
I'm very excited I love mists huh ah
what what the oh you know oh absolutely
not
this shoots water look at my shirt like
this spits water like a damn camel whoa
I hope that doesn't take off my brows I
honestly hope my squirter is just broken
these is not a fine mist at whole not a
fine mist well I don't like that there's
like water on my desk like it shot all
the way back there I don't have any
primer so I'm just going to prime my
face with the NYX angel veil for
foundation actually do have a new
product that I purchased online at
Walmart this is the l'oreal infallible
pro glow foundation to having use it on
my face i don't exactly know if this is
my color this is 203 nude beige it
honestly was like the only one that
wasn't sold out on the website so i
bought it and i bought this on the elf
website precision sponge trio i was so
excited when i saw this so it comes with
a little one kind of like a micro mini
like the Beauty Blender and then a
medium one kind of like the Beauty
Blender a blusher and then a big one
kind of like the regular Beauty Blender
so that's really cool it feels really
nice
it feels really nice I'm gonna go with
it look how big it got it's your pangas
it's so big so I'm just taking some of
this foundation on the back of my hand
we'll see if it's my color
well I feel like this sucks up a lot of
product holy crap like all that
foundation is gone that's weird
you know what I'm gonna do half my face
with this sponge and then half my face
with another one because I feel like a
lot of products got sucked up into it I
don't know I don't know how I feel about
the sponge I love the texture
I love how bouncy it is like I love it
but I feel like it's soaking up a lot of
product I'm going to use the Real
Techniques sponge on the right side of
my face okay yeah definitely this just
spreads out so much more product like I
put the same amount on the back of my
hand and it did my entire right side of
my face
when this side like with this sponge I
had to like pump it twice on the back of
my hand so right at the bat this one
nation is really really nice I think the
original infallible Pro matte has more
coverage but it still looks really
really pretty on my skin it gives you a
nice natural glow not too dewy and I
really love how it feels when I touch my
face like it feels just like barely
tacky some dewy foundations just feel
super sticky on the skin this one does
not okay so for concealer actually have
new concealers to face recently sent me
there born this way naturally radiant
concealers so I'm going to be trying
this out I haven't tried it yet I'm so
excited to do this I'm gonna take the
shade fair and I'm gonna apply this
underneath my eyes to cover up my dark
circles and to highlight my face as well
I'm also gonna bring this onto my
eyelids to kind of prime my lids so I'm
so sorry that I didn't post a video on
Wednesday it's just been a shitty few
days honestly with all the things that
have been happening like in the world
recently I just went in a funkin I mean
it's not about me obviously but I've
just been in a sad mood you know I'm not
gonna film a video if I'm just not in it
if my heart is not
it and I just don't feel good and I'm
just don't feel right I'm not gonna film
a video and I know this is my job and
you know this is what I do but you guys
would be able to tell if I'm not in it
if I'm in a funk like you guys know well
today I woke up with a little bit less
anxiety and I thought okay you know what
I'm going to sit down and film because I
need to have a video up on Friday which
is today if you're watching this on the
day I upload so um I think I love this
concealer I think it has really really
nice coverage I love the consistency so
far so good
I feel like this concealer oh my gosh
I'm gonna set that with my cosmetics bye
bye pours powder because I feel like
this foundation accentuates my pores a
little bit so I want to add some powder
right here on my cheeks just like erases
there doesn't make them completely go
away but this powder like works miracles
I'm not gonna powder my entire face
because I want to go in with cream
products in a second but I'm going to go
ahead and do my eyes I feel like my
brows don't match today my brows are
looking so wicked these days I have to
do them I hate this next thing I have to
fix it with like a glue gun or something
okay so I recently got like a ton of
Pallas in the mail I was gonna use at
the Anastacio Modern Renaissance palette
but I want to go like more bold on the
lips and this is like vetti bold on the
eyes if you want to see a tutorial using
this palette let me know I'm either
gonna use the new lorac pro 3 or I'm
going to use the violet Voss and Laura
Lee collab reps Laura this is so
stunning and beautiful I love violet
boss shadows this is an amazing palette
and I'll probably use like a mixture of
both of these I just realize I've had a
ponytail in like the last three videos
oh well I'm going to go into the little
rock 3 and I'm going to take pink nude
this is a Sephora Pro crease brush and
I'm just gonna buff this into my crease
I haven't used any of these eyeshadows
before I don't know what I'm doing on
the eyes honestly I just know I want
something that isn't too cray cray I'm
going to go into the Laura palette I'm
going to take a little bit of Priss pot
and do the same thing but I'm not
use too much of this color it's very
similar to Peach Smoothie by makeup geek
just adding a little bit of warmth now
with a more precise little crease brush
this is the Luxy 231 small tapered
blending I'm going to take breeches
right here which I love that name it's
like witches with attitude our britches
well I don't know I'm gonna add a little
bit of this on the outer corners I am so
sad that I have not been watching like
TV shows I feel like all my shows are on
hiatus right now um I completely fell
off of arrow and flash which is so
unlike me because arrow is like one of
my favorite shows haven't seen I haven't
seen it at all in months I need to get
back on that I'm going to take the shade
clay right here and I'm going to do the
same thing I just did layer that color
right on the outer corners and put it a
little bit in the crease
I always think I have a lot of things to
talk about when I sit down to film these
videos and then I get here and I'm like
okay what do I say I feel like I get in
the zone when I'm putting on makeup I'm
like and I don't talk I'm gonna take
another Luxy brush this is the 2:13 and
I'm going to take canvas right here and
I'm going to put this in my actually you
know what actually I'm going to take
canvas and I'm going to apply this on
the inner corners of my eyes I'm going
to mix the shade basic and sugar as my
brow bone highlight okay so now I'm
going to get a little bit smokier on the
outer corners but with a cooler toned
eyeshadow I'm going to take this one
from Urban Decay called Secret Service I
just bought this on Sephora the other
day because I wanted a really like deep
cool tone color and I feel like I didn't
have one which I'm sure I do I'm going
to take this elf crease brush and apply
this to the outer corners of the eye
so story time really quick I'm a little
bit concerned because I ordered some
shorts like two weeks ago and they have
not gotten here yet I got them on the
Selena Gomez like merchandise website
they're like jean shorts that say like
gomez on them or something
I bought them to wear to the Selena
Gomez concert that I did not go to but
it's not like that would have gotten
here in time anyway because I have not
received them and I cannot find my email
anywhere I feel like I accidentally
deleted it so I don't know what the
issue is with that I have to go like on
her website and figure it out thank you
guys so much I talked about why I didn't
go to the concert on Twitter and you
guys were so nice about it I was beating
myself up for hours but you guys are
just you guys always make me feel so
much better
I'm just antic a fluffy brush and just
blend things for some reason I had a
really bad anxiety the day before the
concert or two days before the concert
or something like that and I was like
maybe I shouldn't go you know I don't
like crowds I don't like concerts the
only reason I bought tickets to Selena
Gomez is because I love Selena Gomez
going back in with this to add a little
bit more
I love Selena Gomez so much I've only
been to one concert in my life and it
was a John Mayer concert when I saw that
Selena Gomez was touring I bought
tickets months ago I was so excited like
two days before I had really really bad
anxiety about going for some crazy
reason I don't know why but I was really
really really trying to convince myself
that it was gonna be okay and then um
the night before the concert
unfortunately like Christina Grimmie
passed away and it shook me to my very
core like I was so sad and it was just
so unfortunate like she was just at a
meeting reactor performing and signing
autographs and doing all that and
somebody like just came up Terrence shot
her and it's the world is a messed up
place I'm going to take this first shade
that I used pink nude and I'm gonna just
blend things out here at the edges the
next day was the concert and I went to
my sister's house and I dropped off the
tickets and I was like
I can't go I'm if I go I'm gonna have a
panic attack I'm gonna ruin the night
for you and I don't want to do that I
knew that if I was gonna go I was just
gonna panic while I was there so I gave
her my ticket and she took her cousin
I'm gonna go ahead and line my eyes I'm
gonna use the master precise skinny did
I spit everywhere I think so
but Maybelline oh that's all right I'm
gonna put on some wings liner
my eyes get so watery every dime next
time I'm going to use the physician's
formula I bosta to add that wing I
cannot talk during this I need to focus
okay wings are on this is as good as
it's gonna get folks I'm actually going
to add a little bit of black eye shadow
I'm going to take this jet black shade
add just the smallest amount on the
outer corners here just to deepen up up
tail I'm going to take this little
Milani crease brush
okay so for my lower lashline I'm going
to take pretty much the same colors I
used on the top not all of them this is
a Lux a 217 I'm going to go into pink
nude blend that underneath my lower lash
line I don't want something too smoky
down here I'm going to take clay and do
the same thing I'm going to take this
238 brush by zoeva I'm gonna go into a
secret service and just apply this like
on the very outer corner I'm really
loving this eyeshadow it's the perfect
deep cult home brown I love eight I want
a super bright inner corner so I'm going
to wait till I highlight my face and
just use that I'm gonna go in with my
flower beauty's doom in ultimate mascara
on my top and bottom lashes now I'm
going to go in with some falsies I'm
going to use the kiss lashes these are
in the style camellias I love these
lashes I bought them at Walgreens they
just look so natural but like wispy and
fluttery at the same time but very
natural love them love them they're a
little bit flimsy so it's a little bit
hard to work with but once you get them
on they just look so natural
I mean you you're wearing falsies but
they look nice so I'm gonna play these a
hoodie click and be right back the
lighting just got really awful because
South Florida weather so it's about to
downpour okay so now that the eyes are
done pretty much just got a highlight
I'm actually going to be using these
products for the first time I've never
tried these colour-pop came out with
sculpting sticks I'm gonna be honest I'm
a little bit skeptical I don't know how
this is gonna go I'm gonna use the shade
easy-peasy I was gonna use dove but that
looks just way too gray
I'm gonna use my Real Techniques sponge
to blend this soon
let's pray this goes well because I
really like how my eyes turned out and I
don't want to ruin my makeup I'm gonna
try on my forehead I'm gonna try my
forehead first so I'm just gonna kind of
like paint this hmm I don't know
actually yeah I'm gonna try to buff this
instead
I feel like this is taking off my
foundation though I don't know hmm okay
so it blends it out all right
I don't mind cream contouring but I like
something that's a little bit more
emollient something a little bit blend
ear
this is a little bit like to dry for me
I don't know let's just try like a
little a little bit I mean it looks nice
once you blend it out but it's just a
little bit difficult I personally prefer
something with a little bit more
creaminess
okay so first impressions on this I
don't know if I like it I have to play
around with it a little bit more not my
favorite now I'm just gonna bronze the
skin and contour a little bit more I'm
gonna take this bronzer this isn't new
or anything but it's new to me I just
purchased this on Sephora this is the
cover effects bronzer in the shade
suntan I thought that this had a really
nice undertone it has more of like a
cool undertone so I'm gonna take this
like up and up brush from Target I have
no idea what the name is it came in a
set and are you just going to bronze
Muffy
I have hairs going everywhere did your
mom ever like when you were younger your
mom or grandma or whoever raised you
took care of you I don't know when I was
younger and like my hair was like frizzy
like that's like my mom would lick her
hand and like pat it on my head thanks
mom
I have saliva in my hair Thanks maybe
that was just my weird-ass mom Oh anyway
what I was telling you guys earlier I
feel like I completely stopped my story
about the Selena Gomez concert I went to
my sister's house and I like dropped off
the ticket and when I got back in the
car like to go back home I cried the
entire time
on my way home because I felt so stupid
because I knew that what was holding me
back really was just like fear in the
crowd and stuff and I was so mad at
myself for letting for letting that get
in the way of something I had been this
neck thing for letting it get in the way
of something that I had been planning
for months and something that I had was
like I was so excited to be there I got
floor seats it really sucks you know
sometimes when you feel like you're kind
of going backwards instead of going
forward I was really really hard on
myself that day but you guys were so
encouraging we all have bad days and we
all have struggles I really hope I don't
allow that tap into myself again if I
ever get a chance to see her in concert
again anyway point of my story is I just
want to say thank you so much for being
so encouraging on my Twitter so I really
really like this bronzer I like it I
like it that's the shade of Sun Tan I'm
gonna go in with blush I'm gonna take
this blush right here from Tarte this is
one of their new blushes I've never
tried this either this is in the shade
risque I don't know if these blushes are
available yet or if they come out next
month I'm gonna use my Bobbi Brown blush
brush is a very natural blush color
perfect for the lipstick I'm about to
put on
that is such a pretty color and so
natural it's like a nice nude pink wow
that's so pretty
I love the Tarte blushes they last like
a million years for highlight I'm taking
a new product I haven't used on my face
yet I've just watched this I'm so
excited this is the Ofra highlight in
the shade Beverly Hills five different
colors kind of like in a color wheel you
have a white a white gold a gold pink
like a silvery pinky pearl so pretty I'm
actually gonna take this shade right
here this is a morphe g37 and I'm going
to use this shade to highlight Wawa that
is pigmented gonna highlight the tip of
my nose because I like it and I'll keep
it slow a little bit I have a 30% off
code for Oprah if you guys want to use
it it is Kathleen 30 I will have that
all listed below it is an affiliate code
just wanna let you guys know okay so now
I'm going to go in with my lip color I
want to do something like really
different I want to do black lipstick
but I want to do it with like some
shimmer in it uh-oh if you guys have
seen but like Kylie Jenner is releasing
this like black liquid lipstick that has
like shimmer and it's like really really
pretty and I thought that I could maybe
do something really similar so I'm gonna
take the jeffree star liquid lipstick in
the shade weirdo and I'm going to apply
this to Mel's okay so my lips are done
and I kind of want to leave it like this
like I really really like it but I'm
gonna add some lip topper this is a jus
a lip topper in the shade skinny dip
it's like a gold reflective lip topper
so I'm gonna add a little bit to the
center of my lips I'm scared I don't
know okay but yeah let's do it
okay so that added just a little bit of
something I'm gonna take some of this
off with a white because I don't want it
to put like black liquid lipstick back
into this little lip topper okay guys so
that completes this look I know it's not
very summery but for some reason I
wanted to do like a metallic black
lipstick I was so inspired by Kylie's
new lip color so this is the look I came
up with and I hope you guys enjoyed it
yeah that completes this video thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already I
almost forgot what I say at the end of
my video Wow please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
