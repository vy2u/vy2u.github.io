Oh
Hey so today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial on the makeup that I'm
wearing right now it is a pretty black
and gold smokey eye this is perfect if
you're going out at night I think it's
so pretty it makes any eye color stand
out because of the intense black
eyeliner it's just one of my favorite
looks to wear when I go out at night
with Danny or you know anything romantic
or something I don't know anyway I hope
you enjoyed this makeup tutorial let me
know what you think about it down below
in the comments and stay tuned if you
want to see how to get this look first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my Urban Decay primer potion and
I'm gonna prime my eyes with this then
I'm taking Mac's painterly paint-pot
and I'm going to be putting that on top
of the primer potion usually I would
just use either one of these things but
I'm nope
today I use them both and I really love
using the painterly Paint Pot under the
gold eyeshadow that I'm going to use
because the gold really sticks to it
because it's a little tacky
I'm taking my Naked palette and I'm
using the golden net palette and it's
called half-baked and I'm going to be
putting this all over my lid and I fast
forward this part because it's kind of
boring but I just love how intense this
eyeshadow looks on top of painterly
paint-pot
I wasn't a fan of this eyeshadow at
first because for some reason it didn't
go on very pigmented on my eyes but when
I use a tacky base like that it goes on
really intense
now I'm going to take naked and I'm just
going to blend out any harsh line that
half-baked left on my eye
now I'm going to go in with the color
book and I'm just going to be doing this
same thing adding a little bit more to
the outer corner and then into my crease
just to give some dimension
now I'm going to be taking a matte brown
eyeshadow this is brown down from Mac
but any dark brown eyeshadow will work
and I'm going to be focusing this on the
outer part of my eye and bring it into
the crease as well
and I'm just going to go back and forth
and really blend and blend and blend
it's a process but you know how it goes
and now I'm going to add some black
eyeshadow and for that I'm using Mac's
carbon any matte black will work I'm
taking it on a little brush like this
and I'm packing the color onto the outer
V and then swiping it in to blend it
into the gold and also taking it a
little bit into the crease so I'm
basically just packing the color on the
outer V and then just dragging it in
okay now I'm going to take this little
angled brush and I'm going to be dipping
it into carbon again and I'm putting
some black eyeshadow in my waterline now
I've been doing this since middle school
it's never imitated my eyes I never get
eyeshadow into my eyeball I just like
using eyeshadow on my waterline whenever
I want it to be really intense because
black eyeshadow on my waterline just it
doesn't move it doesn't go anywhere and
it stays really really intense so I like
doing it for more dramatic looks but you
can go ahead and use black eyeliner I
mean it doesn't make a difference but
I'm going to be adding this to my
waterline and to my tight line
now I'm taking my favorite gel eyeliner
and I'm going to do my wing look you can
do it as thick as you want and I started
to record it and then this happened
yes I'm completely out of the frame and
I didn't even notice I know bad Kathleen
but you get it just do your wing liner
however you want to do it now I'm going
to go back into the carbon and darken
the outer V of my eye because after I do
the wing liner I like to just deepen out
the outer corner you can do whatever you
want you don't have to do it really
intense or anything but I just wanted to
make the outer V a little bit more black
now I'm taking that same brush and I'm
just going to make my lower lash line
even more intense and I'm not putting it
into the water line again but I'm
putting it really really close to the
waterline this is kind of the main focus
of the look I feel I wanted it to be a
very thick eyeliner look so that's what
I'm doing here
and even though I wanted it very very
intense I didn't want it to be just a
harsh black line so I'm going to take
buck and just kind of blend it and smoke
it out a little bit I still want it to
be very black and strong but I'm just
taking buck and naked to kind of soften
it just a tiny bit now for my highlight
I'm taking virgin on a tiny little brush
putting that into my tree tip and also
adding it underneath my brow bone on a
big fluffy brush and just blending the
crease color and the highlight color
together now I'm just going to take my
Holy Grail that was so cheesy mascara
and putting that mascara on yeah I hate
voiceovers so much they're so weird okay
now for the rest of my face I'm just
fast-forwarding it because I feel like
I've done it a trillion times but I'm
just taking my magic Lumi light infusing
primer and using that as my primer I
love this stuff and for my foundation
I'm using the Maybelline fit me
concealer I actually love this as
foundation because it has a very nice
creamy consistency it's medium coverage
and it's not cakey at all it like blends
out like a dream it's amazing for
foundation I love it so much
for underneath my eyes I'm using my mac
prolongwear concealer I almost forgot
the name of it weird because it's like
my absolute favorite under-eye concealer
this does not crease it doesn't move it
doesn't settle it's the best under-eye
concealer I have ever used in my life
and then of course I'm going to set that
concealer with my favorite powder this
is Mac MSF natural and medium I don't
set my foundation or my powder with or
my concealer with any other powder
because this one doesn't make me look
cakey which is awesome for the rest of
my face I'm actually not using blush I'm
just going to take my Real Techniques
blush brush and use my ELF contouring
blush and bronzing duo and use the
bronzer just to warm up my face because
this bronzer is super pigmented it's
awesome so I'm basically just kind of
contouring but not really I'm kind of
contouring and using it as a blush as
well I'm just putting it all over my
cheeks just to warm up my face because I
really want the focus to be just on the
eyes so I don't want blush on but you
can add an added blush if you want now
for my highlight I'm using the MSF in
soft and gentle and I'm putting this
everywhere
for my lips I'm using the Wet n Wild
mega last lipstick and think pink I'm
just dabbing it on my lip just so it
doesn't come on really opaque and then
to top it off I am using the NYX butter
gloss in creme brulee I love this
combination it's like the perfect nudey
pink lip and butter glosses on remaining
and then of course a little spritz of
fix+ to finish off my face thank you so
much for watching guys I hope you like
this tutorial and I will see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
