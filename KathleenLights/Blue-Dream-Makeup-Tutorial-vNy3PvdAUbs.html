tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now this is the look I was wearing in my
best of colour-pop video which I'm about
to film right now but you would have
already seen it so this is the look I
was wearing in that video only I have on
a different lip because I'm about to
change it for that video but anyway this
is the look and I am using my dream
Street palette I've gotten so many
requests from you guys to use more of
the blue shades in the palette I have
like a full matte teal smokey eye using
this color up on my channel but I wanted
to play around with the more shimmery
blues and they seize the look I came up
with I messed up a little bit on the
eyeliner but you know it isn't a
kathleenlights video unless I F up my
eyeliner but besides that I love how
this look turned out it's so bold and
colorful but it was so easy to do and I
hope it inspires you to use the Blues in
the dream Street palette it's fun to
play around with color sometimes and I
love that this palette can do both for
you so I hope you guys are enjoying all
of my dream Street tutorials I wanted to
make it a point to really upload
tutorials using my palette so those of
you who bought it can follow along to
some of my tutorials so I hope you are
enjoying these videos but anyway I just
dropped my phone anyway if you want to
see how to get this blue look and just
keep watching okay so my eyes are
already primed and I'm just gonna jump
into the dream Street palette I'm gonna
take the shade shooting star and I'm
just gonna start buffing this color into
my crease just working this in a little
by little building up the color this
look takes a lot of crease work a lot of
blending in the beginning so just bear
with me here
now I'm gonna go back into the pallet
and I'm gonna take the dark brown it's
called elfish and I'm gonna be doing the
same thing kind of but I'm not really
taking this past my crease with shooting
star was kind of putting that everywhere
but with this shade I'm really really
focusing this on the outer corners and
I'm dragging it into my crease I'm being
a little bit more precise with this
shade and just slowly building up that
color
little by little lots of building now
I'm going to take water-bearer and I'm
gonna do the exact same thing I did with
elfish focusing this on the outer
corners and dragging it into the crease
building up the color a little by little
so I'm gonna create a cut crease effect
but I'm not gonna take it all the way
like I usually do or like how I've done
in the past I'm just gonna do like a
halfway cup crease so I took my color
pop concealer and I'm just carving out
my lid you see here what I'm doing I'm
not passing the crease and I'm not
really taking it all the way towards the
end and then I'm just gonna fill in my
little fill my linen with concealer and
then everywhere I applied the concealer
I'm gonna go in with the shade
kaleidoscope so on a flat brush I'm just
going to apply this wherever the
concealer is
so to blend the outer corner with the
Kaleidoscope shade I went in with the
shade mermaid boy and I'm kind of using
this to sandwich the outer corner in
with kaleidoscope does that make sense
well you see it goes from like a
gradient it goes from kaleidoscope to a
mermaid boy - then water-bearer and I
think it looks so pretty
so I went back into water-bearer just to
intensify the blue because a lot of it
did get blended away while we were
blending all that eye shadow so I'm just
adding some more blue to the outer
corners and then to clean up the crease
and just you know to blend everything
make sure it's nice and seamless I went
back into shooting star so that I can
get rid of these harsh little lines YZ
okay so I'm gonna hop into Moonie and
I'm gonna use this to hop into Moonie
that was weird I'm gonna use this to
highlight my brow bone and then I took a
makeup wipe to clean out the to clean up
the fallout and to create kind of like a
cat eye effect to the eyeshadow so I
just made the edges really sharp so I'm
gonna move on to the rest of my face
before I finish up the eyes you know the
drill I went in with my dr. Brandt
Luminizer primer and then I went in with
two foundations the first one is the
hourglass vanish Foundation stick I just
pop this on everywhere and then I mixed
in a little bit of my Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I still don't
like the luminous silk on its own but I
love it mixed in with other foundations
so this is the little cocktail and I'm
using today buffing that out with my
love is the foundation brush and then
for a concealer I went in with my color
pop no filter concealer this is the
shade light neutral and I'm just buffing
that in with a brush I like doing one
side first and then going into the other
side because this I don't know I've
recently I've been doing that with my
concealer and I feel like it just it's
better because the other side won't dry
so quickly and it just looks a little
bit more seamless and flawless and not
as dry if I do one eye first but anyway
I'm just highlighting the rest of my
face with the concealer as well and then
to set everything down I'm using
Patrick's powder I'm so excited
I love prep trick I think he's awesome
this is a great great powder I think
especially if you have oily
because it is very mattifying but even
with my dry skin I don't think it looked
dry under my eyes so I liked it to
finish up the eyes I'm going in with the
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil in the
shade main line I love this eyeliner I
use it all the time it's like the
perfect teal blue it looks so nice with
other blue eyeshadows so I put that on
my waterline and I tight line with that
as well and then for my lower lash line
it's very quick I just didn't I just
went in with some shooting star then
some elf inch and then I went in with
water-bearer as well kind of mimicking
what I put in my crease I'm just
smudging that on my lower lash line
for my inner corners I went in with a
little bit of Moony but since this look
is so intense I wanted to go in with
something even more intense than that so
I took the colour-pop highlighter in
flexitarian and I just pop that right on
my inner corners to give me that bub I
am intense inner corner highlight and
then for mascara I'm using the Thrive
cosmetics liquid lash extensions mascara
I'm only applying a little bit of this
because I'm going in with some falsies
these are the kamil number 16 ez lash
falsies they're just falsies that go on
the outer corners of your eyes so I'm
here I'm just like brushing out the
mascara I'm making sure nothing is
clumpy or goopy and then I went in with
my em cosmetics Illustrated eyeliner in
the felt tip and I created a very thin
line just to hide the lash glue and so
that everything looks nice and seamless
but anyway I applied some lower lash
mascara and then I went in with some
bronzer this is the Thrive cosmetics Sun
tracer bronzer andraia I love to contour
with this it's such a smooth creamy
bronzer I love it and then to warm up
the skin just a little bit more and give
myself a little bit more of like a
bronzy glow I went in with the
colour-pop bronzer in the shade private
party this has a little bit of a sheen
to it versus the real one that's matte
so I just wanted a little bit more of a
glow for a blush I'm mixing these two
together this is the jus a blush duo in
a door and I'm just gonna mix them both
together and pop them on my cheeks I
love this blush combo it's like the
perfect peachy pinky nude so so pretty
and then to highlight the tops of my
cheeks I'm taking one of my favorite
color pop highlighters this is the here
kitty-kitty highlighter it's a really
pretty like pearly shade and I'm just
popping that on my cheeks like I said
and then I'm just gonna melt everything
into the skin by setting everything down
this is the Milani make it last setting
spray and then I'm gonna pop on my lip
combo this is the nude sticks lip and
cheek pencil in the shade whisper one of
my favorite nude colors ever and then
I'm gonna pop on some gloss on top this
is the
pop over glossy lip in the shade
moonchild and that completes this video
