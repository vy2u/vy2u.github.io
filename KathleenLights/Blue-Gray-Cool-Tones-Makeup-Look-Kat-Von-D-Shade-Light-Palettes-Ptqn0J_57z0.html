tutorial on the look I'm wearing it is
using the Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette and the Kat Von D ink liner in
necessary natsu yes
niche knit alrighty here I was actually
really excited to film this because if
you follow me on Instagram and Twitter
you've already you would have already
seen me freak out but I got a package to
my house um with the Kat Von D shade +
light eye palette and like I think all
of the ink liners and I was like oh cool
and then I read the letter like the
little note that it came with and it was
signed by Kat Von D and it was like a
little personalized letter from Kat Von
D so I tweeted her because you know Dani
and I have been watching like Kat Von
D's show for so long like his eternal
dream is to be tattooed by Kat Von D
like we love her so much and so I
tweeted her and I was like okay is this
letter really from Kat Von D or am I
being punked and she wrote back and she
wrote to me of course I did I think
you're the bee's knees I almost cried I
remember I ran to Dani and I was like
Kat Von D's England the bee's knees she
did send it to a few other youtubers
like people were commenting to me like
why do you feel so special she sent it
to like a million other people and I
don't care I don't care she send it to 3
million people I still think it was
really nice of her to sit down and write
a little letter to everyone different
because every letter said something
different so she took the time out of
her day she's very busy one
she sat down and wrote me a little
letter it kind of shows her character it
shows the person that she is and it was
just really nice and she didn't need to
do that so it was so sweet I have the
monarch palette and I really love it I
just I don't know I hadn't purchase it
so after she sent me that and I was just
like really excited I went to Sephora
and I purchased the shade in light
contour kit just because I wanted to go
and support her even more because I
thought what she did was really sweet
and I got the brush as well so I
purchased these two things and I used
them in the video today so this is a
very Kat Von D ish video it's not
sponsored I'm not being paid this video
is not sponsored metal but yeah so
anyway I'm like rambling at this point I
just wanted to tell you guys that story
and I wanted to work I wanted to play
around with the cool tones in this
palette because you guys know that this
section is what I gravitated towards the
second I got in the mail I was like go
again I'm all about this but I wanted to
do a tutorial focus on the cooler
eyeshadows in this palette because I
never do and I like how it turned out I
think it's pretty cool especially with
this lip color by la splash so yes I'm
sorry I talk too much and we wanna see
how to get these look wasn't just gable
washing save time I already primed my
eyelid and now I'm gonna take the Kat
Von D shade + light eye palette and I'm
going into this creamy yellowish shade
this is called Ludwig I believe Ludwig
yes I'm going to try my best to
pronounce these names because they is
hard to pronounce then I'm going in with
this more creamy vanilla kind of shade
this is called succubus I think actually
it could be called lucious I'm not sure
I think it might be succubus but anyway
then I'm going to go in with my
transition shade and I am using this
neutrally Brown called latinus
let's do this I think so the names are
on the back so it's hard to know which
one goes to which but I'm taking this
neutrally well grayish taupe color and
I'm using the Kat Von D like I brush
that you can buy separately but it came
out with the shade and eye palette and
I'm applying this in my crease and I'm
using this brush because it plays
smaller more dense brush and it's going
to apply the product a little bit more
like precisely right in the crease there
then I'm going to take this dark gray
color this is called liber Addis and I'm
applying that right directly into my
crease so I don't want to blend it out
like a transition shade or anything I
want to make sure that most of that
product is concentrated right in the
crease I'm just going to blend that all
the way across my eyelid
then taking this shade called say Leo's
oh my god I'm butchering these names I
know I'm so sorry but I'm applying that
on my entire lid just to intensify the
lid color then going right back into
that gray color and blending it out some
more so that it's seamless and there are
no harsh lines there I'm going to take
that same see Leo's shade and I'm
applying this underneath my brow bone to
highlight and lift the brow a little bit
then I'm going into this black color in
the palette and it's called Shaq's sex I
think so and I'm gonna apply this right
at the tape of my oh by the way I
applied tape earlier on if you missed
that I don't know so I just focused the
black right at the tape and brought it
into my crease a little bit I just want
that black color a little bit on the
outer view of my eye so I'm taking this
really cool periwinkle blue eyeliner and
I'm just gonna do a wing like if it was
a normal black eyeliner you guys know
the drill I suck at doing this on camera
but I'm just doing a typical you know
winged eyeliner the only difference is
this is blue and stead of black so I'm
going to go on and do the rest of my
face makeup before I finish up my eyes
you guys know I always do that I'm
taking the step one equalizer from Make
Up For Ever this is the hydrating one
applying that to my entire face and then
I'm going in with the Bourjois healthy
mix foundation this isn't the healthy
mix serum this is the foundation it's a
little bit more matte not as luminous as
a serum I love them both but yeah I
didn't want to go super dewy for this
look I'm applying that with a morphe
brush from the elite collection it's a
really great just basic flat top kabuki
yours have seen me put on my foundation
a million times and then I'm going to go
in with my Maybelline fit me concealer
in 15 fair applying that underneath my
eyes to not only like cover my dark
circles and that redness but to
highlight my face
and then I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend that in you guys asked me in a
previous video what this brush was this
brush is from Sedona lace it's called
the 217 I have been loving this to blend
out my concealer underneath Matt it's
like a giant eye brush with a giant
blending brush I love it
it's a blend out the concealer really
nicely so just blending all that in then
I'm going to take the contour palette
the shade in light contour palette by
Kat Von D and I'm actually going to take
the brush as well but I'm going to take
the contour side to set my concealer I
think it's a little bit flimsy for me to
contour with so I really really like it
to set my under eye concealer because of
the shape it gets right underneath my
eyes really nicely and I don't know I
have been using it for that and I really
really love it I was mixing the two
colors to set my under eye concealer the
yellowish color and the like Pinker
color lirik and lucid and mix those two
so yeah went back into the eye palette
I'm taking that neutrally gray or like
that grayish taupe called Lazarus and
with a pencil brush I'm applying that
underneath my lash line then I'm taking
the darker grey applying that underneath
my lash line as well succubus no
Liberata
this is so confusing
and then just didn't like balance
everything out that Newt really brown
sheet I'm applying it to my lower
lashline to so that it could just you
know blend everything out and then all I
did while I was off-camera was apply
mascara to my top and bottom lashes and
then I put on some falsies I used the
ardell demi whispies so going right back
into the contour palette I'm using the
highlighting side of the brush and I'm
going to start contouring my cheeks
using subconscious it's the more cool
toned color in this palette so it's
great to carve out the cheekbones and to
like add that shadow to your face so I'm
just applying it very very lightly and
then I'm just going to add a little bit
of warmth to my face using the color
shadow play it just has a little bit
more of a warmer undertone so I'm
applying that right on top and just
blending it out
for my blush I am using the Urban Decay
8 hour blush in the shade fetish I just
want a very light application of this I
don't want like too crazy because I
don't want any blush to like clash with
the blue eyeliner I know that's right
but just a light application of these
I'm going to take the Make Up For Ever
Pro sculpting duo in zero one it's that
more pinky silver highlight which I
think goes well with this look so I'm
highlighting my cheekbones with this
Real Techniques blush brush from the
bold metals collection and then for my
favorite part this is the lid
combination oh no just one lip one one
lip product this is the la splash lip
couture in the shade
ghoulish they have to they have AG
ghoulish which is the original and then
they have just plain ghoulish this is
plain ghoulish I really love the la
splash liquid lipsticks I just bought a
couple more so I can do a lip swatch
video for you guys they're really great
I like them so this is a really cool
toned purpley taupe and I love it so
that completes this look thank you guys
so much for watching I really hope you
enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't

video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
