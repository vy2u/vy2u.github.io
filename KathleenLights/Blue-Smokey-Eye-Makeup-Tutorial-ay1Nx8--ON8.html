tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I really love this look because it
is a dark smoky eye but it does have its
hints of color it's not like a typical
brown smokey eye it's a little bit
different it's a little bit more bold
for me because I like more Brown type of
shades but I really love how this turned
out this video is sponsored by NARS
which I'm really excited about because I
love this brand so I created this eye
shadow look using their new narcissist
eyeshadow palettes and I mainly used the
more sultry shades in this palette this
is definitely my favorite color in the
palette it's like a greenish blue really
pretty I use this blue right here this
dark shade and then the more lighter
shades as well I use the few shadows and
I really really like this palette what I
love the most is that they're more
wearable shades or the shades that you
would normally use more often are bigger
in this palette and I really appreciate
that plus it has a really beautiful
mirrored packaging and I'm just really
impressed with the quality I really
really love it so if you want to see how
to get this look then just keep on
watching
I have already primed my eyelids and now
I'm going into the NARS narcissist
palette I'm going to take this eyeshadow
right here called creme bisque and I'm
just going to set my primer down with
this eyeshadow now I'm going to go into
this one right here and it's called cafe
au lait
and I'm going to use this as my
transition shade and I'm just buffing
this into my crease so that all the
others can blend nice and smoothly now
I'm going to take this crayon stick from
the loc brand that Tati created and it's
just a nice charcoal color I'm blending
that out with my finger and now I'm
going to take cafe la one more time and
just buff out those harsh edges
going back into the palette I'm going to
take this color right here it's my
favorite color in the palette and it is
called industrial steel it's a really
pretty blue green teal shade so stunning
and I'm just packing this on my entire
lid taking it all the way up to the
crease now I'm going to take this one
it's called black truffle and I'm just
going to deepen out my crease with this
so I'm just packing this into my crease
with a blending brush from LA colors and
I'm going to go back into cafe au lait
and make sure that everything is nice
and blended there's a lot of blending
with this look but it is really really
easy so I'm going back into black
truffle and I'm gonna deepen out my
outer corners just a little bit I don't
want anything too intense or too black
in the outer corners but something that
gives a little bit of depth I just took
a makeup wipe and just wiped out all the
fallout and I forgot to show a clip of
it but I used the elf glitter primer
right in the center of my lid and then I
took um the makeup geek sparkler in the
shade zodiac and I applied this right in
the center I don't want to apply too
much because I don't want to take away
from the blue but just a little pop of
something then I just went in with some
black liquid liner and I created a very
thin wing this is the Physicians Formula
black eyeliner and then I just
highlighted my brow bone with this
yellow matte shade in the morphe contour
palette so I'm quickly going to move on
to my face before I finish up my eyes
and I'm just priming my face with the
pixie flawless primer and then I'm
mixing two foundations together I'm
mixing my Bourjois healthy mix serum
with my ex1 visit wear foundation and
I'm just buffing that in with my artis
brush and you guys have seen me put on
my foundation about a million times so
I'm just speeding it through this so for
concealer I'm using my H&amp;amp;M Beauty
cover-up concealer in the shade Manila I
like something a little bit less yellow
but I really like the consistency so I
use it underneath my eyes and then I
just buffed it in and I set that with my
NYC translucent setting powder okay now
let's finish up the eyes this is the
makeup geek full spectrum eyeliner in
the shade royal and I just buffed that
out with a pencil brush and then I took
this amazing blue in the palette it's
called regal blue I love this shade and
I just added it right on top of the
a purple eyeliner just to make it a
little bit more blue going back in with
cafe au lait I'm just making sure
everything is nice and blended so for my
inner corners I'm taking shimmering
Pink's and it is the most beautiful
highlighting shade and I popped that in
my inner corners and then I applied some
falsies from Kiko so to finish up my
face I'm going back into this morphe 9si
contour palette and I'm just taking that
color that I pointed at and I'm just
contouring my face once I've done that
I'm going to apply my blush this is from
L'Oreal and it's called apricot kiss and
I really love this blush I wanted
something really natural as use I
decided to go ahead and take shimmering
pink sand in the palette and I decided
to use that as my highlight because it
just looked so pretty in my inner
corners that I wanted it all to match
and I really love how it looks as a
highlight and then to just finish off
this look I'm taking the H&amp;amp;M Beauty lip
liner in the shade all natural and I'm
just applying this on my entire lips and
this is what I'm using as my lip color
so that completes this makeup tutorial I

palette I really really liked it and I
