what the hell that was about today's
video is going to be a makeup tutorial
on the look I'm wearing right now I was
extremely expired expired
I'm not expired not yet I mean I was
inspired I've had three Cuban coffees
before filming this video today because
it was fitting so I was extremely
inspired by the whole Kim Kardashian
blue eye look that was really popular
like two weeks ago but I've been
traveling a lot and I had no time to
film this video
I finally had time today and I sat down
to film it and I've been wanting to film
this specific look with this specific
eyeshadow so today was the perfect day
because today is when this palette
launches did this look using the blue
eyeshadow in the al-ahmad cosmetics
thing now they got Eva palette I spoke
about this palette in my Physicians
Formula review by the way I put on hoops
I wasn't wearing hoops throughout this
entire video but I did this whole makeup
and instantly I felt like Jennifer Lopez
so I took the Rhodopes so I told you
guys about this palette in my last video
and I used the really intense amazing
blue it's called about a Leto and it is
the most beautiful blue eyeshadow ever
it's very similar to the blue in the Kim
Kardashian palette called Libra this one
is a little bit more like ocean blue
that one is a little bit more royal blue
I was really inspired by the look she
had on her Instagram coz it was all just
blue there really wasn't much else there
was like a little bit of eyeliner and
everything else was just like blue so I
really wanted to recreate it and then I
got inspired to dress like this palette
I saw this sitting in my closet I'm like
oh my god I'm gonna leave a time stamp
right here letting you know when the
tutorial actually starts because I do
want to give you guys some swatches and
some information on this palette but it
is a very very easy look like this was
so easy to do like even easier than I
thought it was gonna be I knew it was
kind of just like a one eye shadow look
but I didn't think it was gonna be this
easy but it was and you don't already
know one of my closest friends Gaby she
is my makeup artist for a kale polish
but she is way more than that to me we
went to high school together she's one
of my greatest friends and I kind of
feel like Gabby and I were kind of meant
to like linked because I went to high
school with her but we weren't really
friends like we would follow each other
on tumblr we weren't very close but we
both always had like
common interest of makeup I remember
Gaby has always wanted to come out with
her own makeup line and she finally
launched her own brand like her herself
she's been working on it for over a year
I've kind of seen all this develop like
right in front my eyes and it's so
amazing and so inspiring she's done
everything on her own if you didn't know
al-ahmad is actually a place in Cuba she
was born in al-ahmad and this is the
famous that got even vol.1 palette and
it's so cute it has like the little
volume one here looks like a little book
and the colors in here are amazing this
is like a tropical getaway dream this
actually lunches
2 days this palette launches today along
with 3 other mod brushes it's called the
ojitos trio okay though his eye and I'm
so freaking bummed because I had those
brushes they are stunning like when I
first saw them in person I was like ah
Cathy I love them I've never really seen
green brushes like this I think they're
so unique very soft I just don't have
them I left them at Gabby's house and
then Gabby actually tried to offer me a
set before filming this video but the
uber driver got really freaking lost and
couldn't find my house for some crazy
reason so I'm so bummed I wasn't able to
film this freaking tutorial with the
allemande brushes but they're really
soft and they're really great I love
that she is doing something to celebrate
her culture and where she's from I love
supporting everyone obviously but I love
just seeing fellow Hispanics really
thrive and just I love it so to see a
whole brand I'm like the motherland is
amazing you've been wanting to discover
a new brand al-ahmad is cruelty free
gabby is so creative like i just know
the things that she's gonna launch what
this brand are amazing she is so
talented and so smart when it comes to
the cosmetic world so I just cannot wait
to see what this brand brings because I
know it's gonna be good I know it's
gonna be freaking good quality of these
eyeshadows are so buttery and smooth
there are four mats here on the bottom
and then the four shimmers these are
more like metallics if anything they are
so insane and monochrome is my favorite
oh this one right here I cannot wait to
do more looks with this probably I
actually want to do a look with these
three like these three make the most
delicious tropical look ever so I really
want to do a look with those because I
definitely need to do more looks with
this palette since I'm only using two
eyeshadows and
days.look but this one in and malecon is
like blinding it's so good you don't
even have to wet these eyeshadows it
says on the palette that you can you'll
get like a more foiled look but you
don't even have to do that because they
look filed on their own honestly these
are incredible and I don't know if you
guys actually know this but my summer
collection for Kayla polish is actually
Cuba inspired as well well this is not a
summer collection but my summer
collection is Cuba inspired and it was
really funny when me and Gabi were like
sitting down discussing my summer nail
polish collection and like the makeup we
wanted to do we were like oh my gosh we
need to use a LeMat on my eyes because
like hello al-ahmad it's gonna be coming
out a couple months before my nail
polishes it's gonna be so cool like it's
so amazing and we used this eyeshadow
palette and a few of it looks we did for
the summer collection like the reveals
you know my nail polish reveals it's
just so cool it's just so quiet
I'm so excited can you tell I'm just
really freaking excited but anyway now
that I've talked your ear off in today's
video I am using this along with a bunch
of other stuff obviously I'm using some
of the Jennifer Lopez and Inglot
collaboration they purchased a few of
those products and I'm using him in
today's video I know a lot of you guys
have been asking me what I think about
the whole collab but today was the first
time I even tried some of these products
on my face so I have to test them out a
little bit more to let you know but
anyway if you want to see how to get
this Kim Kardashian inspired makeup look
then just keep watching okay so I'm
starting off with the pea Louise makeup
base and I'm just priming my eyelids
then I'm gonna go in with my dream
street palette I'm gonna take the shade
shooting star and I'm gonna buff this
everywhere in my crease and then I'm
also gonna take mooney underneath my
brow bone
and then I'm gonna take some tape I'm
gonna apply some to the back of my hand
first and then I'm gonna put on my face
if you don't feel comfortable doing this
don't do it you could easily get this
shape with like a makeup wipe but I just
put some tape to create like a cat eye
effect and then I took this Jordana
twelve-hour made to last I shot a pencil
in tenacious brown wow this is super
expired and I totally regret doing this
it's just that I wanted a dark chocolate
base so that the blue can just appear a
little bit darker but this was so hard
to blend and it ended up kind of
backfiring in the long run because it
made my eye shadow look a little bit
cracky like towards the end of the day
my eye shadow was cracking and it was
this freaking eyeshadow base so I threw
it away after I filmed this video
because it was really old but just any
brown chubby eyeliner or like any
eyeliner will do I just applied that as
a base color and then I went over it
with the violet O shade and as you can
see I'm just applying about a little
absolutely everywhere and then with a
fluffy brush this one is from Wayne Goss
it's just like the Mac 217 I am really
taking my time to buff out the edges of
the blue since this look is pretty much
a one eye shadow look I do want to take
my time and make sure that it looks nice
and blended in the crease
I'm gonna take my Marc Jacobs eyeliner
this is the black one I love these
eyeliners I am tightlining with this and
then I'm just taking off the tape seeing
those sharp sharp edges I'm just
cleaning up all the fallout here and
then I noticed that the like the angles
weren't perfect so I applied some
eyeshadows to the corners just so that I
can drag out the wing a little bit
further because I felt like they were
just a little bit off then I just took a
little like pencil dome type of brush
and I'm just blending out the edges
because even though I want a cat eye
look I don't want it to be like super
super harsh so I just blend it out the
edges a little bit and then that's
pretty much it now I'm just applying
some eyeliner this is the balm Schwing
liquid liner I love it it's very matte
very black and Kim didn't really have a
thick line so I just added a nice thin
little line for some definition alright
so before I finish up the eyes you guys
know I like to do my face for primer I'm
gonna use the origins or perfecting
cooling a primer with willow-herb I've
heard so many good things about this but
I've never I've never used it myself
did I shake this up enough okay I'm just
gonna oh oh yeah I used way too much oh
my god this is so cold
well this smells good okay so
immediately I noticed that that does
fill in the pores just kind of sinks
right into the skin and feels like
nothing all right
for foundation I want to do kind of like
a very full coverage look I want this to
be very glam very glamorous because we
all know Kim Kardashian is very
glamorous so I'm gonna be using these ua
essential high coverage cream foundation
in the shade of fawn I'm gonna be using
this because this is super full coverage
but what are we mixing it with this this
is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
radiance drops I like mixing this in
with foundations whenever I feel like
they're too matte let's see how much of
this I'm gonna take some it varies I
think I'm gonna do two drops
I'm gonna mix all that in together and
I'm just gonna blend that out using my
it cosmetics airbrush foundation brush
full coverage complexion brush okay so
this foundation is a little bit too dark
for me as you can see compared to my
taste for concealer I do have like two
new concealers but I don't want to use a
new concealer because I have a new
powder I want to test out and I want to
make sure that I'm giving the powder a
full chance but I have this hourglass
natural veil fluid that they came out
with veil retouching fluid excuse me and
I've actually read a lot of mixed
reviews on this but I definitely do want
to try it out later on let me know your
thoughts on this have you tried this and
I also picked up the Ulta the uLTA
Beauty full coverage liquid concealer
it's waterproof this has been around for
a while but I've been really wanting to
test this out but I'm gonna keep it
simple for today I'm gonna use my milk
makeup flex concealer in light so that I
give that powder a nice fair shot and I
already know I like this concealer I've
been using it a lot I love this flex
concealer just the packaging sucks
because my stopper is always falling out
you know what's weird
I like this concealer but it smells like
patron like it smells like patron shots
and every time I put on my face I'm like
oh
patron used to be my favorite thing in
the world it was the only alcohol that
didn't make me feel like crap the next
day like oh I loved it and then I had a
really bad night on it once and now I
can't even smell it and to me this
concealer reminds me of a girl you know
I actually don't think I like this
concealer on top of that jouer
foundation I feel like my under eyes
look weird for some strange reason they
look really dry today this is the new
hourglass veil translucent setting
powder I've heard so many good things
about this already I'm so excited
so this packaging is really really cool
when you open it it has
h-here where all the products comes out
so ideally you're like oh great a lot of
powder isn't gonna get anywhere but in
my opinion this still has messy
packaging powder does get everywhere if
you shake this too much so be careful
I'm just gonna sit when you swatch this
powder on the back of your hand there is
like a little bit of glow to it it's not
a shimmery powder so don't get scared
but it there's like a glow to it like
it's not a flat powder you know I feel
like this made my under eyes look really
bright like I mean it brighten them up a
little bit so I like that I just
honestly I can't even tell if I like
this right now because my under eyes
look so dry at the moment I'm definitely
gonna try this out with different
concealers different foundations and
then I will let you know how I feel but
so far so good
I feel like this laid nicely on top of
my skin and for me having dry skin
already underneath it didn't cling to
any dry patches which I really like I'm
gonna bake my smile lines ignore that
I'm gonna finish up the rest of my eyes
right now and then we will finish the
face I'm going in with the shade lip
Osten I'm gonna use this to highlight my
inner corners Kim had blue in her inner
corners so I tried to extend the blue
all the way down to my inner corners but
just having only blue was kind of
freaking me out so I highlighted with
luck we'll stir and then I apply some of
that Marc Jacobs eyeliner to my
waterline and I took the blue shade and
I just smoked that underneath my lower
lash line and that's it for the lower
lash line
so for falsies I just used these from
pure these are like this they're silk
lashes and then for a mascara I just
went in with the Clinique high impact
mascara alright so the eyes are now
completely done I think it's like almost
identical or Kim Kardashian's I want to
say for bronzer I don't have anything
new to test out so I'm just gonna go in
with my bye bye pours bronzer buy it
cause Manny and I'm just kind of wrong
the skin while like contour
same time you know
I completely forgot that I wanted to use
some of the new Jennifer Lopez Inglot
stuff I didn't purchase much I just got
these two these are the new makeup geeks
power pink makeup geek power pigments by
the way I have them in this little
makeup meet thing but I picked up these
two Jennifer Lopez engli blush
highlighter trio
I got gold dust and I also got silver
dust this one looks more gold to me I'm
actually gonna use a little bit of gold
dust on my cheeks just to see how this
goes I haven't tried any of the JLo
products I've been really excited to try
them on camera so yeah I'm gonna add a
little bit gold dust
I'm gonna take my Sonia Kashuk blush
brush dip my brush into this when I was
originally swatching everything when I
got it in the mail I noticed that these
powders felt a little dry so let's see
how it looks this trio has a bronzer and
a highlight and then a little blush in
the middle this kind of has all three so
I'm just mixing it all together so it's
not gonna come off
super blush on the cheek because it does
have that highlighter and bronzer mixed
in one but it did give my skin a nice
glow I have to play around with this a
little bit more obviously but I really
like the little touch gave my skin and
then for highlight I'm gonna mix two
highlights today I'm gonna use the
Jennifer Lopez Inglot live in the
highlight illuminator for face eyes and
body oh nice I'm gonna add a little bit
of this I'm gonna take some from the cap
this is like a loose shimmer highlighter
and I'm just gonna pop some of this
actually I'm gonna put some of these on
my collar bones here okay yes I I did
this on purpose first so I can see if it
was shimmery this is a very shimmery
loose highlighter like I can definitely
see the little shimmers in it I'm a
little bit nervous about putting that on
my face I'm gonna put my other highlight
on first I'm gonna take like oil stock
from the allemande palette and I'm going
to
a bit of this and pop this on my the
tops of my cheekbones I'm just slowly
building this color up because this can
get really intense really fast like if
you want a blinding highlight Blackwell
style he's blending just okay and now
I'm gonna take a little bit of that
Inglot highlight but I'm gonna take it
on my color pop small fluff brush cuz
this like packs it on and I feel like
it's gonna give me more of a sheen oh my
gosh
yeah this has loose shimmer particles
it's making me uncomfortable
oh my gosh mmm I like this I think that
is just sitting on my skin for a night
out like if you want to look really
glamorous and like really sparkly under
the lights yeah for sure definitely but
nothing a little setting spray won't fix
so I'm actually gonna go in with this
brand new of cover effects dewy finish
setting spray my excited I got when I
saw this they came out with two new ones
the the dewy finish one and then they
came out with like a 24-hour one that's
supposed to make your makeup last all
day and I actually want to do like a
wear test with that one I mean if you're
interested if you want to see that let
me know down below but I thought my skin
needed the dewy one today cuz I by the
way this has the same mist as the
illuminating settings break ah that's
what it oh yeah oh my god this mist is
unbeatable
unbeatable it's so fine that your face
doesn't even feel wet like you can go on
and on you know that highlight actually
looks nice once you set it like it just
sinks right in where's my fan
you know this got caught in my hair the
other day this fan while I was filming
it's a video I pre-recorded it should be
up soon
I kept it in the bloopers just for you
guys oh my god I look so do we now Wow
don't be full of rocks and I got one
without almost didn't game relax you are
not Jenny from the block oh my gosh you
guys my face is dry I thought my face
was still wet dude they're not kidding
when they say Dewey how do we do I look
right now I'm actually gonna apply some
powder like right here because I think
I'm too dewy her lips Kim Kardashian is
wearing a very like brownish noodle it
I'm gonna go in with one of the Inglot
Jennifer Lopez lipsticks I have a matte
one and then I have like a regular one
the regular one is called Dolce but the
matte one doesn't have a name it says J
2 1 3 like Dolce says J 2 0 3 Dolce and
this just says J 2 1 3 no-name all right
I'm gonna take the no-name one yeah this
is very nude I thought it was gonna be a
little bit more brown but I'm not hating
it actually it doesn't look like Kim
Kardashian's nude but that's okay
I actually like this I thought I was
gonna hate it but I like it I know it it
looked like a snake coming at you right
there that was drew this was my table
doesn't look exactly the same but this
was my take on the Kim Kardashian blue
look I really really hope you check out
