tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing I
wanted to do something around the theme
of just like one color like a
monochromatic kind of look it's kind of
like a dusty rose eye shadow blush and
lipstick kind of look actually my liner
is a lot thicker than I wanted it to be
but it's okay I actually really like how
it turned out for those of you
requesting a very like springy dewy
fresh natural makeup that is coming up
soon I wanted to do something a little
bit more bold and dramatic first since I
rarely do looks like this so yes I
rarely use winged liner because I suck
at it but I'm trying to step out of my
comfort zone more and more every day
basically if you know how to do winged
liner then this is the easiest look of
life the only difficult part is the
winged liner because it's literally the
easiest I look known to man so yeah if
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching okay so I'm
going to be priming my eyelids with the
Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion this
is the new one well I mean I wanted to
say new but it's pretty new and it's in
the shade Aden I believe and then I'm
going to set that with some translucent
powder so to start off this eye look I'm
just using two shadows this one is from
NARS it's one of their dual intensity
eyeshadows it's in the shade kauri and
I'm just adding this as my transition
shade you could totally skip this step
because you could do that with this
eyeshadow as well this is the star
attraction this is color pop superstar
super shock shadow in wattles w ATT le s
yes waddles that is what I'm putting on
my entire lid and in my crease as well
when you're working with color pop
shadows in the crease make sure you're
using like fluffy synthetic brushes
because they just work best with the
color pop formula so I'm using all
synthetic brushes here to highlight
underneath my brow bone I just used a
light reflecting powder this is a
setting powder from laura geller
just using that to highlight a little
bit underneath my brow bone nothing too
crazy and then i'm going to tightline
with
the next so Julie liner in jet black or
pitch black yes pitch black and now to
apply this wing okay guys I cannot do my
wing on camera because I have to get
super close to the mirror but just do
your wing the way you would normally do
it my wings got a little cray-cray as
you can see here they sicker than a
snicker I didn't want them this thick
but we're gonna go ahead and go with it
I think it's cool to have bold liner
every once in a while so I just primed
my face with the NYX born to glow
illuminating primer and then I'm going
in with foundation this is the benefit
hello flawless oxygen Wow foundation
this was the first time I used it I'm
using a more feet East Express to apply
this and I really like this foundation
it's a little bit too yellow for my
undertone I have more of a neutral e
undertone but it's a really pretty
foundation I forgot to show you the
concealer I was using so I'm holding it
up here this is the Maybelline better
skin concealer and I'm just applying
this underneath my eyes to cover up my
dark circles and to highlight my face
but you've seen me blend in concealer
about a million times right so I don't
have to show you every little thing just
blending that in I'm gonna set my under
eye concealer with my a cosmetics bye
bye pores powder I'm using a Sephora Pro
90 brush to apply this and I'm also just
applying that on any area where I
applied concealer and now to finish up
my eyes I'm going to apply some nude
liner this is the Rimmel scandaleyes
nude liner I believe it's called nude
and then I'm going to take waddles one
more time and apply this to my lower
lash line just so that it can match with
the lid matchy-matchy for mascara I'm
actually not going in with my Kiko one
surprisingly I'm going in with the
cosmetic superhero mascara then I
applied some falsies and I'm
highlighting my inner corners with
makeup geek whimsical eyeshadow and that
completes the eyes I'm moving on to Zee
face right now I'm gonna take the prime
and fine
Katrice contouring palette I got this at
Ulta and it was so affordable I think it
was like under $3 and it does a really
nice job at contouring I like the
undertone
it blends out really really nicely and
then I'm going to just warm up my skin a
little bit using this elf mineral
bronzer in the shade tan toffee and with
a more face stippling brush I am just
buffing this unto my face to just add a
little bit of warmth to the look so for
blush I'm actually using the eye shadow
used in my crease earlier this is the
NARS dual intensity eyeshadow and khari
and yes I'm using eyeshadow as a blush
because why not I just wanted everything
to match really nicely and I think this
is a really pretty blush so moving on
I'm gonna highlight the tops of my
cheekbones using the nataschab de Nonna
glow powder in the shade light
zero-one I'm just blending that on the
top of my cheekbones and on my nose to
highlight and to finish off the look I'm
gonna add some lip liner this is the
Aquarius lip liner by colour-pop and
then right on top of it I'm going to go
in with another color pop product this
is choker I believe yes choker lippy
stick that's going right on top of the
Aquarius lip liner this is a cream
finish I really like this lippy stick so
that completes this video I hope you
