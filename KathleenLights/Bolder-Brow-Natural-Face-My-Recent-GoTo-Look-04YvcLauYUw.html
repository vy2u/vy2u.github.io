tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing I
have worn this look and a lot of my
recent videos this is literally the look
I am wearing in my MAC lipstick dupes
and I told you guys I was trying out the
bold brows and then I wore this look in
another previous video and you guys
really liked it so I decided I might as
well just film a tutorial on it even
though it's so incredibly easy and basic
and natural ish because I'm using a few
products but it's natural ish and I
promise you guys this has been my go-to
makeup look for like two weeks before I
get on with the tutorial though I just
quickly wanted to say I'm not wearing
foundation in this video I'm not going
like heavy on the face or anything like
that just because I feel like I don't
need foundation every single day but you
can still totally do this look and
decide your primer and foundation
underneath and you'll be fine so if you
want to see how to get this simple and
natural look just keep watching okay
guys so I always do my eyebrows first
just because I feel like it so it takes
the longest and then once I'm done with
that I just breeze on through the rest
of my face so yeah I used two products
for this look is the Anastasia brow Wiz
in brunette which is a little bit too
dark for me my hair has a lot of warmth
to it and this doesn't have enough
warmth so I use this and then I use
Mac's quark eyeshadow right on top to
match my hair color a little better I
just go with the natural hairs of my
eyebrow and just start painting them
just to make my eyebrows darker I don't
really change the shape much I just make
this part a little bit thicker
once I've done that I take the spoolie
side of the brows and then I comb it
through just to get rid of any harsh
lines
I do like bold brows but I don't like
brows that look super drawn on if that
makes sense so once I've done that all
I'm gonna do is go over it with an
eyeshadow and for that I use Mac's cork
so the brush I use to do that is this
one I got at Michaels
it is the brand royal and langnickel it
was like three bucks at Michaels and
it's amazing and all I do is just go
over the entire eyebrow just like I did
with the brows
and then when I get to the front of the
brow I just create a little square with
the edges of the brush
so once I'm done that's my eyebrows I
move on to the rest of my face and I
don't wear primers every day unless I'm
wearing foundation so I just use my
moisturizer as my base I'm gonna take my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and I'm going to apply
this on my dark circles and up in here
too and then drag it down in a triangle
shape catching the sides of my nose
where I get a lot of redness not
catching covering the sides of my nose
very good love redness and then I drag
it up like this it's a very very large
triangle basically like if I were
highlighting my face if I had foundation
under just using a lot more product
since I'm not using foundation
then I take it down the bridge of my
nose
and right and between my eyebrows and a
little bit on my forehead in a little
triangle shape like I said it's just
like if you were highlighting your face
only I'm using a little bit more product
and now that I look really cute
I'm gonna take my Real Techniques
contour brush and then just blend it all
out and I'm also going to drag it on my
lid
and I do that because I like to cover
all the really yucky veins I have on my
island
okay so once I'm done with that I'm
gonna set everything and I know I look
like Casper the Friendly Ghost
but bronzer bronzer fixes everything so
I'm gonna be taking a giant fluffy brush
this is the Sigma f30 and I'm going to
take my Mac MSF natural in the shade
medium I'm gonna set my entire face with
this
this also adds just a little bit more
coverage so then the next thing I do is
add some bronzer since I look extremely
pale and today I'm using the NYC Sun and
bronze bronzer in Montauk bronze this
changes every single day I do this look
so often that I use different bronzers
every day but today I'm using this one
and I am using my blush brush by Real
Techniques so I just add the bronzer
where you would typically add it like
the contours of my face on my temples
and stuff
so after I've done that I do use some
blush just to add some more depth and
life to my face and the one that I have
been using non-stop is the Tarte
Amazonian clay blush in exposed because
it is literally the perfect everyday
blush and it lasts all day so this is
what it looks like I use it on my it
cosmetics blush brush and then just dab
some on my cheeks just to add a little
bit of something to my eyelids I take my
big fluffy brush this is the Sigma
tapered blending 840 and I dip it into
whatever bronzer I'm using tap it off
and then lightly dust this into my
crease
so I like to set my face before I put on
my mascara because it drives me crazy
when I like wet my mascara I don't know
so I do use two different things
normally I would just use one of these
things but since I did apply a lot of
powders to my face and I have dry skin I
like to spritz myself with fix+ first
just because it takes away the powder
enos and that powdery look and then when
that's pretty much dry I use my chill
makeup setting spray by urban decay I
would normally just use this alone
because it does have a cooling and
hydrating effect but mama loves fix+
what can I say so I just spritz that on
my face lightly and then I think this
one does help it lasts a little longer
so now I'm just gonna add mascara and
I'm gonna quickly curl my lashes and
then I'm just gonna add my mascara I
always use the Jordana best lash extreme
whenever I'm not wearing like eyeshadow
or anything like that because it's
really volumizing and it really captures
like your attention it's like it's big
and then for my lips to be honest on a
day-to-day basis I just use some
chapstick or like a nude lipstick or lip
gloss but recently I have been using my
Nivea lip butter in the vanilla and
macadamia case it's just it's chapstick
okay so that is it this is my both brows
and natural face makeup this is what I
have been wearing a lot in my videos
recently so thank you so much for
watching guys please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next one bye
that dad nothing I don't love your
singing but your coming out in my video
so be put it before they would so before
so I'm sure I've done that so after I do
that I like to add some blush to my face
just to add some more oh my god oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
