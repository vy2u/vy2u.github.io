tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing right
now it was a very very highly requested
makeup tutorial and I was overwhelmed by
how many of you guys wanted a tutorial
on this look I was like manage to film
the tutorial right before I filmed that
video but I do this look all the time
the only thing I don't do often is the
blue underneath my eyes which actually
really love I think it gives such a
beautiful like twist to the look the pop
of blue underneath the eyes but I do
bronzy warm colors like this all the
time I am using the original Naked
palette which you guys know is my
absolute favorite palette I do this look
so so often and I never wanted to do a
tutorial on it because I feel like
there's so many tutorials that look just
like this with the Naked palette but it
was so highly requested that I decided
to go ahead and film it plus I think the
pop of blue is just so beautiful I think
this is such a beautiful nighttime
summery look or you can wear it in the
daytime because I am right now I don't
care I'm just really obsessed with this
look as well I think it's like a very
like go until they come to me I don't
know I think I heard them in a movie
somewhere I don't know anyway so yeah if
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep on watching
ok so I've already primed my eyes with
Urban Decay's primer potion but now I'm
going in with the Maybelline Color
tattoo in caramel cool and I'm going to
apply this all over my lid and up to my
crease as well
the palette I'm using is the Urban Decay
Naked palette and I'm going to take the
color book which is the darker one out
of the two matte shades and this is
going to be my crease color so I'm just
going back and forth into that buck eye
shadow because I want my crease to be
very pigmented I want it to look like
the color is going up pretty high past
my crease so I'm just taking my time and
blending this out adding more and more
eyeshadow little by little
next I'm going in with my favorite color
in this palette and it is called smog
and on a regular flat shader brush I'm
going to apply this all over my lid up
to my crease
you
then I'm just going to take the color
right here it is called half-baked it's
a beautiful beautiful gold color and I'm
going to apply it right to the center of
my lid it's going to give it like a
really pretty pop of gold then I'm just
taking smog again and I'm going to apply
it to the very outside of my crease and
the very inner part of my eye as well
just so that the gold can really stand
out
now I'm just going to line my tightline
I'm not going to line my waterline but
just my tight line with this Maybelline
master drama eyeliner in Midnight master
and then I'm going to take the color
virgin and this is going to be my inner
corner highlight and my brow bone
highlight as well now I'm just going to
go in with falsies I am using my ardell
demi whispies and I am NOT adding gel
eyeliner or liquid eyeliner so I want to
make sure I get it as close to my lashes
as possible here I'm just adding some
more book just to deepen out the crease
moving onto my face I am going to prime
with my L'Oreal miracle blur not so much
prime but try to cover up some of my
pores I'm just adding this to the places
where I think I need it
this stuff is just way too thick to put
on my entire face but it does work well
in certain spots on my face the
foundation I'm going to be using is my
Revlon Colorstay this is for normal to
dry skin this is in the shade 250 fresh
beige the foundation I wear when I have
a little bit of a tan like today and I'm
going to apply this with my Real
Techniques sponge
for concealer I'm gonna mix my booboo
cover-up concealer and my Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade 15 light and
I'm going to mix them both and apply it
underneath my eyes
I'm also going to drag it down like in a
triangle shape to highlight as well
I want underneath my eyes to be really
nice and bright for this look so that's
why I'm doing that I'm going to first
blend it out with my fingers and then
blend it out with my Real Techniques
contour brush
next I'm going to take my Maybelline fit
me powder in 1/35 creamy natural and I'm
going to use to set the under-eye
concealer
really quickly to finish off underneath
my eyes I am taking my Urban Decay eye
liner in main line and is a beautiful
matte teal color I absolutely love this
eyeliner and I'm going to run that on my
waterline and then I'm going to take max
Flemish eyeshadow plumage plumage
plumage pretty sure its plumage and on a
tiny little brush I'm going to run that
really really close to my waterline just
to smudge out the eyeliner a little bit
then with a clean pencil brush I'm just
going to smudge it out even more so it
could look nice and diffuse and blown
out
and then I'm going to add some mascara I
am using my Clinique lash double Inc
mascara
to finish off the rest of my face I am
using my Bahama Mama bronzer by the balm
and I'm going to use my tapered
highlighting brush from Sigma and I'm
going to use this to contour and I'm
going to focus on my temples and you
know the tops of my forehead and on my
cheekbones just a place where I always
contour
I don't really like to do a super harsh
contour or anything like that I never do
but just enough to where it chisels out
my cheekbones just a little bit you
don't have to contour just bronzing up
your face would still look really nice
with this look
I'm going to take my Maybelline master
highlight highlighting blush and nude
and I'm just going to add this to my
cheeks I'm going to do like a light wash
just so I can give me a little bit of a
glow for my lipstick I am using my
Revlon soft nude lipstick and then that
completes this makeup look thank you
