right now it's using the wet and wild
vanity palette um I wore this look in my
April favorites video and someone
commented saying that they would like to
see a tutorial on the makeup I was
wearing in that video so that's what I
did right now oh I hope you enjoyed this
look and let's get on with the tutorial
okay so as always I'm just gonna start
off by priming my eyelid I am using elf
eyelid primer and then I'm using my NYX
eyeshadow base right on top then I'm
gonna be taking my wet and wild manatee
palette and I'm going to be taking a big
fluffy brush like this this is an e 40
from Sigma and I'm taking this color
right here and I am just working that
into the crease
I'm just adding kind of like a base for
the other shadows I will be putting in
my crease now I'm gonna be taking my ELF
eyeshadow brush and I'm going into this
bronzy brown color right there and I'm
putting this all over my lid
next I'm gonna take that same brush and
take this really bright gold color and
put it on top and I want this look to be
very Goldy but this by itself is a
little bit too gold it looks like a
yellow but when you put it when you
layer it on top of this Brown it gives a
really nice Goldy bronze look with the
pencil brush I am going to be taking
this bromley color and putting it right
under my lashes my bottom lashes I never
know what to call this thing this my
bottom next with a blending brush like
this this is my dirty mac 217 and I'm
gonna be taking the darkest Brown and
I'm gonna be working this into in my
outer V I also I'm gonna be taking this
into the crease when you do this you
want to deposit most of the color on the
outer part of your eye and then work the
rest into your crease so you don't have
such a dark color in your crease and
then that just it just won't look good
like that so just kind of pack on most
of the color in the outer V and then
bring it in and now I'm just gonna be
taking that same brush and that same
color and just really deepening the
outer V of your eye and not taking any
more into the crease just trying to make
it a little bit darker on the outer V
make it more dramatic a little more
smoky
now I'm just taking my eyeliner and
finding my waterline
and my tightline next I am taking my ELF
cream eyeliner which is a gel liner and
this is my favorite gel liner because
not only is it really black but it stays
in place all day it does not move and my
favorite little angled brush for a gel
liner is the elf small angled brush it's
really stiff so it's good for beginners
or if you know you don't have a steady
hand with gel liner this is really good
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
get as close to the lashes as possible I
don't even want it to look like I have a
winged liner on or anything like that or
if I have gel liner on at all but this
is gonna make it seem like your lashes
are a lot folder at the base of your
lashes so that's what we're gonna do
so once you've done that you're just
gonna take the really dark brown in here
and go over the black pencil brush that
seemed brown putting it right here but
I'm not singing it past the people going
back with my e-40 we're just gonna do
that very first step all over again but
I'm not getting directly into the crease
just kind of above the crease a little
bit it's just gonna warm up the look a
little more and then for my highlight I
am using this know this matte cream
color shade
then just pack on your mascara
okay so I've already filled in my
eyebrows off-camera and I've been doing
off-camera because my eyebrows are wild
it's so bad I just I need to get them
done ASAP before I start filling them in
on camera and I've already applied my
foundation and my bronzer I used L'Oreal
True Match Lumi this is in the color and
three natural natural buff yeah I've
been using my naked up a Naked basics
I've been using my nearly naked
foundation so much that I forgot how
good this is I love this and then I just
contoured with a NYC sunny bronzer this
thing is amazing and it's two dollars it
can't be that so um I'm just gonna take
my Maybelline instant age rewind and try
to cover up my dark circles as best as I
can
for my highlight I'm gonna use my
L'Oreal magic liudmila infusing primer
this thing is amazing for highlighting
oh my god you have no idea
and I just take some I was a tiny little
dog in the back of my hand I have some
to my cheekbones so the tops to the tops
of my cheekbones and then i kind of
blend it out with the brush a little
then I go back and dab it with my finger
this just gives such a pretty glow I
love it
I mean I think that's so pretty I
definitely do not wear this every day I
am as a two day basis I don't highlight
my face I sometimes don't even contour
my face so this is just kind of like
when I do if I'm gonna go out or
something like that so yeah and then for
my lips I'm using two lip products and
of course I am gonna add petal rebel on
top of something that I've been doing
that so much I'm just gonna apply Max
naturally eccentric lipstick and this is
a very pale nude so I like to add powder
I pile on top because it just makes it a
nice little baby pink it's just pretty I
like adding this on top of like paler
lipsticks to kind of give it like a baby
pink look oh I forgot to add my blush
uh-huh
I'm just gonna take max Melba which is a
peachy pink really really pretty blush
it's one of my favorite blushes from Mac
and I like adding a matte blush remember
I have such a like glowy foundation and
highlight going on so I like to add
which I should have done this before my
highlight but I'm all over the place I
didn't realize I didn't have much okay
so yeah that's the finished look it's
just a really pretty
Goldy brown smokey eye with you know
peachy pink cheeks and a light pink lip
so I hope you enjoyed this look thank
