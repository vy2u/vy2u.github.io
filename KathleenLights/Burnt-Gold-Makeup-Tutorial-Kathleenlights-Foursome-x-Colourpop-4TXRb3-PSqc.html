a makeup tutorial using um the color pop
where the light is for some made my
kathleenlights made by me I made this if
you guys haven't seen my previous video
where I talk all about this um why I
made the colors I made why I named them
the way that I named them swatches and
all that stuff I will link that video
down below it's the video that went up
before this it's very very much me it's
very in my comfort zone and a lot of you
people are gonna be like girl you always
do looks like this but I mean it's for
colors and there's no this is what I
like to do I just want to represent me
as much as I can in this tutorial I will
be doing more tutorials with this quad
I'm going with foursome because it's not
like a palette but I'm gonna be doing an
everyday look with the matte shade with
the other shades um yeah I will do more
strudels if you guys want only if you
want it was out of town recently I was
in West Palm Beach on business well
Danny's best liked we went for work
Danny had to go work up there and I went
with him and my face breaks out so bad
so bad when I'm when I travel I don't
know what it is I don't really don't
know what it is but I break out so bad
one on a home it's the weirdest thing I
don't know why I felt the need to share
that store with you but I have like a
nice beautiful break out bouquet right
here so I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and I hope you try it for
yourself if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep on watching
oh I'm fixing my setup I'll talk about
it later but I'm trying to get my old
set up like back in Mississippi back in
my life so I'm working on it oh yeah you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep watching so I'm going to prime
my lids using the Jessie's Girl I shadow
or you can get this I have an age you
can get this at Jessie's Girl cosmetics
that come that's where I bought it and I
really love this primer super shape
super booth like I mentioned before
these color pop eyeshadows are best
applied either with your hands or with a
synthetic brush I'm going to take this
brush and I got this in an Ipsy bag or a
boxy charm I don't really remember right
now and I don't know where it's from it
just says modern minerals you are
gorgeous and I'm going to go ahead and
take the eyeshadow in the shade
and I'm going to apply this underneath
my brow bone like I said in my review or
like not my review but like I said in my
previous video where I'm talking about
these eyeshadows this color obviously is
not going to be a highlight for every
skin tone as you can see but again I
explained it in that video um I wanted
to do a really light creamy shade and I
wanted to do a color that they didn't
already have so this is what we are
working with I'm sorry if you have
darker skin you definitely can mix it
with the matte tan shade and get the
perfect highlight color but anyway I'm
just applying that underneath my brow
bone I assumed you guys and I didn't
realize how far you guys were so next
I'm going to take a synthetic brush
another synthetic brush like this this
is these away the concealer buffer one
for two brush and the way the review is
coming soon I know I keep saying that
but it's coming soon I'm going to take
this shade right here called Cornelius
it's a very warm
pinky brownie caramely latte color yeah
and I'm going to start applying this
into my crease
then I'm going to go in with this shade
right here which is called caffeine
lights it's my favorite one and I'm just
going to dip my finger into this one
this one is definitely one that you want
to use your finger with because it just
applies better but look at that
pigmentation could you faint cuz I could
so I'm just going to apply that to my
entire lid like literally everywhere I'm
going to go back into this smaller brush
and I'm going to dip it into
kathleenlights again it's so weird
referring it to Cathy lights so strange
but um I'm going to run that right here
taking this one next this one is blaze
this one is so beautiful all over the
lid as well or like you can take a brush
like this and pack it on the outer
corners and that would be really pretty
too but I just I love this all over the
lid and on this same brush I'm going to
run that underneath my lower lash line
and I'm going to bring it all the way in
so I can kind of diffuse the gold a
little bit
this one has a lot of glitter to it like
a lot of sparkle to it so it's really
really fun to play with as opposed to
the orange e-gold
that's more of a sheen then with that
same brush I'm going to take Cornelius
and I'm going to run that underneath my
lower lash line just to help blend
everything together I'm going to take
Cornelius one more time and I'm just
going to intensify the crease a bit so
back into this is the wave a concealer
brush and just apply some more to my
crease I love this eyeshadow all over
the lid by itself like just for an
everyday look love it okay next I'm
going to use some eyeliner I'm going to
use my favorite brown eyeliner this is
the NYX um gel pencil liner in the shade
of brown and I'm going to tightline with
this and apply it to my waterline as
well now I'm just taking some on the top
lash look I started doing it and
completely forgot to explain it so I'm
just taking some of this is a very
creamy delicious eyeliner it's great to
smudge out because it gives you the
chance to smudge it out because it's not
stiff and dry so I'm just applying it as
if I were applying eyeliner really
really close to my lashes and I'm going
to take that same brush we've been using
and the smudge it out
oh just poking so
since I want this look to be really
messy and like bronzy I don't want to do
a really professional crisp eyeliner I
want something messy and I think it
looks really nice okay so for my inner
corners I actually want something
sparkly not matte so I'm just going to
take one of the color pop highlighters
these are going to be coming out very
very soon not exactly sure when the
launch date is but very soon and I'm
going to take lunch money
it's a beautiful it's probably my
favorite one to be honest out of all of
them
it's a beautiful like white gold
reminding a lot of moonstone from Becca
and I'm just going to apply that right
in here to finish off the eyes I'm going
to apply some mascara so I'm going to
Chrome it curl my lashes first I'm going
to apply my Estee Lauder little black
primer all over my lashes then I'm going
to apply my Maybelline lash sensational
a sensational right on top and then for
my bottom lashes my clinic bottom lash
and I will be right back okay so once
you've put on mascara as you can see it
kind of completes the look lashes would
be amazing like I said but I think like
like a lot of mascara and like nice and
voluminous and I don't know I think it
looks really pretty like the messy boki
I feel like it's bohemian is that weird
like I feel a bohemian vibe with this
makeup but anyway I'm going to go ahead
and finish the face so I'm gonna do
things a little different usually I do
like my highlight on my cheeks last but
because I'm going to go in with a cream
highlight I'm gonna do it first you
don't have to but I am I'm going to take
the Real Techniques miracle complexion
sponge my camera's dirty layer
and the highlight I used in my inner
corners this is again lunch money from
colour-pop and I'm going to jab my my
little thingy in here now I'm going to
apply that to my cheeks as you can see
it's intense I blend that out now don't
worry I did damn well I did tap in my
sponge before I applied it just to make
it even more intense then I'm going to
take the other side and blend it out so
it's not like you know okay so now we're
going to go in with bronzer and actually
I'm going to use this product right here
with my Mac 129 this is a bronzer slash
blush product from the balm it's called
the balm desert I'm freaking in love
with this thing because it's a long
wearing product and it is this is what
it looks like managed to show you I
don't know if you can tell but it's like
a brown with kind of like a pinky
undertone it reminds me a lot of Mac's
harmony blush which is one of my
favorite blushes from Mac because I use
it as a bronzer as well I have purchased
multiple harmonies like I love it that
much but this is a little bit more pink
in it even so I'm just gonna take it on
this and I'm going to start rubbing that
on my tips these are my tenth on the
fourth for hits a 5 hit Who am I kidding
and I'm not so I mean I guess I'm even
I'm not contouring I mean I'm just
bronzing up the skin obviously defining
my cheekbones a little bit so a little
bit of contour it's very very pigmented
huh you have to be a little bit careful
use a light hand but it's super long
wearing like it lasts all day on the
skin and I think it's a really pretty
color it is matte I don't know if I
mentioned that put the same brush I'm
just going to add a little bit more glow
factor a little bit more worth a little
bit more of me
I need a stop drinking coffee before
film videos this is the NYX blush in
terracotta and I'm gonna pop that on my
cheeks
just to give it a little bit of a glow
by the way if you guys don't have this
blush and you like warm things like why
why do I have it it's really good and so
she you see do you see what's in my
mouth this brush sheds like a mofo and
it was so expensive I paid so much money
for this I mean it's a great brush I use
it all time but they these Mac brushes
shed and they scratch my face a little
bit just a little bit okay so I am done
with my faucet my face and now I'm gonna
move on to lips I'm going to take this
color pop a lip pencil in cake and I'm
lightly good light because this is
pigmented I'm gonna apply that and then
blend it out with my finger then I'm
going to apply umm the colour-pop lippie
stick that I cannot find ah I found it
this is skimpy it's a glossy finish not
a fan of this on its own but I do like
it on top of lip liner like I just put I
want my lips to be even glossy err which
is a big surprise since I'm a Mac kind
of gal I'm gonna take this dose of
colors lip gloss in the shade
why you know has name I'm pretty sure
this is called undressed I'm pretty sure
it's not on the damn bottle but pretty
sure okay yeah so that completes this
makeup tutorial using the where the
light where the light is I hope you
enjoyed this and I hope you guys
purchase this and support me I really
would appreciate it I appreciate
everyone who has bought it so far I mean

if you don't want to buy it I completely
understand girl and no shame in your
game some people don't like these colors
and I totally get that then I hope you
liked this tutorial nonetheless for
those of you who do buy it I hope you

like it even though it's really scary to
put like a orange gold all over your lid
