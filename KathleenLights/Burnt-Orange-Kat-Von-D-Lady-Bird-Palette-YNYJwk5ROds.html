a makeup tutorial using the Kat Von D
ladybird palette it's a nice warm burnt
orange type of look and I really really
love it so the first thing I'm gonna do
is apply my Mac painterly paint-pot to
my entire lid and that's gonna prime my
eyelids and act as a base then I'm gonna
take this shade called unrequited and
I'm going to blend this all over my
crease I'm not trying to be too neat or
precise with this shade I just want it
to be my transition color so I'm
basically buffing it everywhere then I'm
gonna take the lightest shade in the
palette and I'm going to apply this all
over my lid
I'm taking this color right here called
Harlow and on a Mac 217 I am going to be
blending this into my crease and on the
outer view of my eye as well
now for the fun color and it is this
burnt orange right here it's called
Cleopatra and this is the star of the
show and I'm gonna be doing the exact
same thing I did with the Harlow shade
and I'm just building up this color it's
a really really pigmented really intense
color so I don't want to put too much
all at once so I'm just building that
color up a little by little
I'm also going to be taking it a little
bit past the crease
I'm gonna go back into that really light
shade we use on the eyelid and just
apply some more in the inner half of my
eye
just to brighten it up a little bit and
some of it did get blended away now I'm
just gonna line my waterline and my
tight line with this coal by Mac it is
called coaster reach I believe coaster
Richy coaster reach I don't know it's by
Mac it's a really nice reddish brown and
then I'm just gonna take the dark brown
shade in the palette called Wolfe and
I'm just gonna apply this right to the
outer view of my eye just to add a
little bit of depth
I'm gonna be taking my little elf
highlighter this one is called blush
gems and I'm only using this to
highlight underneath my brow bone just
to give a little bit of Sheen since all
of the eye shadows in this palette are
matte so use any shimmery eyeshadow you
have and then I'm gonna go over it with
the light eyeshadow in the palette that
we use all over our lid I'm gonna apply
some of that underneath my brow bone and
right in my tear ducts then really
quickly I'm just gonna create the
thinnest little wing possible I am using
the Milani eye tech perfection liquid
liner and I'm just gonna create the
smallest little flick on the outer V of
my eye then I'm just gonna curl my
eyelashes and I'm going to be using two
different mascaras I'm using the
Maybelline Rocket volume Express and the
Too Faced better than sex mascara moving
onto the rest of my face before I do
underneath my eyes I am using my Rimmel
stay matte foundation I already primed
my face before I didn't film it but I
used the maybelline baby skin instant
pore eraser to prime my face
here I'm just using my little yappy
concealer in the shade buff and I'm just
covering up the little blemishes I have
on my forehead my forehead has been
breaking out and yeah so I'm just using
that to cover up my little blemishes
then I'm gonna use my Rimmel match
perfection concealer slash highlighter
and I'm gonna use this to conceal and
highlight my face
here I'm just blending it out with an
elf pointed foundation brush I'm going
to use my fit me powder in the shade 135
creamy natural and I'm going to use this
to set my concealer
remember on Zahra I'm using the benefit
hoola bronzer and I am just gonna
contour my face and just bronze my face
and then I remembered I forgot to do
underneath my eyes so I am using the
dark brown eyeshadow called Wolfe and on
a tiny little brush I am just gonna
apply this really close to my lower lash
line I'm gonna take this shade right
here and blend out that Brown with a
sigma pencil brush
and then here I'm just using my Clinique
bottom lash mascara moving right back to
the rest of my face the blush I'm going
to be using is this one by Sephora it is
called tangerine tease and it is a
beautiful orange shade with a little bit
of Sheen it's really really really
pretty and then for my lips I am taking
max peach stock lipstick and then I'm
going to be topping it off with Milani
lip gloss in the shade pink lady
and then that completes this tutorial I
really hope you enjoyed it thank you so
