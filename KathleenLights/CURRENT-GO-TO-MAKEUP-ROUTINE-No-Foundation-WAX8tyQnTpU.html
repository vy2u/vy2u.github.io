kind of like in my current go to makeup
these past couple days it's actually the
look I've been wearing every single day
for like a week now and I've done a lot
of looks like this in the past on my
channel but I always loved these minimal
makeup looks because it just gives me a
chance to sit here relax with you guys
and not put too much thought into my
makeup look so we're doing very minimal
things in this video I'm just gonna show
you my current go-to routine basically
what I've been doing what I've been
loving what has been working for me
it's been a very no makeup makeup week
so I just want to show you what I've
been doing alright let's do it okay so
my eyebrows are already on I've been
trying to let them grow out these past
couple weeks so they look insane just
ignore that so whenever I do this look
skin prep is very very important by the
way this is so good this is a cool line
refresher with coconut milk
I discovered this because Kendal ray I
don't know if you guys watch Kendall ray
she hasn't podcast her and her husband
and she's been drinking this in her
podcasts and if they didn't it looked so
delicious and intriguing so I decided to
get it and I loved it I like it more
than the pink drink I just find it so
refreshing it's so good anyway I'm gonna
start off with moisturizing my skin I
usually always use the Kiehl's ultra
facial moisturizer but I have been
testing this out I just recently
purchased this this is the Cora organics
hydrating moisturizer for dry skin and I
have been really interested in this Cora
organics line it's from it's by Miranda
Kerr the Victoria's Secret girl model
and I've been testing out her products I
just recently placed an order on Sephora
I think I like the Kiehl's order of
facial moisturizer even more though this
is not too bad I've been using it a
couple days that's not too bad it's nice
and hydrating but that keels wand always
real good now I'm gonna take a little
bit of this oil this is also from Cora
organics this is the noni radiant oil
for all skin types I've never really
used an IO before but I've been testing
it out these past couple days and I know
I don't know how to feel about it just
yet
but I like the fact that it's like a
little roller I've been wanting to use
something in the mornings like
underneath my eyes besides my regular
daily eye cream something just a little
bit harder explain it's something that's
just really gonna prep my under eyes for
a concealer and all of that and this oil
isn't too bad I feel like you're
does sink into the skin nicely and it's
not too greasy and just let it sit there
for a second let it absorb into the skin
before I go in with concealer I'm gonna
take skin prepping one step further and
I'm gonna use the amazing cosmetics line
smoother and primer and I'm just gonna
roll this onto my smile lines cuz it's a
line smoother okay so now is the part
where I'll just go in with concealer I'm
gonna start off with my under eyes and
I'm gonna take a little bit of my Tarte
shape tape concealer usually on days
where I'm doing like very little makeup
I won't go in with such a full coverage
concealer because it just looks a little
weird but I'm just gonna use it today
today is actually when I'm filming this
it is my little nephew Noah it's his
birthday today I'm just gonna go hang
out at my sister's house and I'll be
there all night so I'm just gonna apply
it a little bit like that a little bit
like that and I know that looks like a
lot but I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender
and it's gonna absorb a lot of the
concealer and I'm also gonna blend it
around other areas of my face I'm gonna
take this onto my eyelids to cover up
all those veins I have so many veins on
my lids and then I'm gonna start
bringing this around the nose dragging
it down a bit so it can conceal other
parts of my face I really try to make
sure I get right up in here because I
have a lot of Darkness
right here so I try to get that
adding that oil underneath really does
just like make this concealer look so
youthful and dewy so I'm also gonna
direct some of this on to my actual nose
in between my brows I'm just really
trying to take this concealer as far as
I can take it so the other day actually
learned a little trick all things to
Emily Noelle because Emily Noelle
tweeted a video that Sephora posted it
on the Sephora YouTube channel on how to
conceal under eyes and how to cover up
your dark circles and in the video I
think it was like a Sephora makeup
artist or I'm pretty sure he's just like
a regular makeup artist that has a 401
but they used him in this actually I
don't know who he is but he gave amazing
tips I'm actually gonna link that video
down below usually especially when you
watch a lot of YouTube videos everybody
will just go in with concealer like I
just did blend it out boom you're done
he explained that after you add
concealer if you have these dark circles
right here that are really deep and you
want to bring them forward you get a
lighter concealer a lighter one then you
just use a new only place the light
concealer right in the darkness so you
bring that forward and then it all looks
nice and even I'm just going to take
this Kevin Ekron the super natural
concealer in light and I'm just gonna
pop this right here and then I'm gonna
take my color pop f11 brush and I'm
gonna start to work that into the skin
and you only want to focus this
concealer on the area where you have
that darkness and you can't really tell
right now cuz my darkness isn't very
pronounced but I've been doing this when
I haven't really gotten any sleep and I
totally see a difference so I just
wanted to share that little tip with you
guys but I will link the actual video
down below because I'm horrible at
explaining things so I'm gonna take my
Tarte shake tape again I'm gonna put
some on the back of my hand and I'm just
gonna take a little bit around my my
nose I like to cover the vein as much as
I can but it's like barely any concealer
honestly just trying to even things out
I apply a little bit on my nose up here
and then I have a birthmark in between
my brows so I like to
that as well so I know I always ask you
guys to request things in the comments I
know I know I know but I need you guys
to constantly request things in the
comments because sometimes I always miss
something and I don't want to miss a
good request you don't what I mean and I
always get caught up and then I forget
to go back to older videos I definitely
still want to do the me testing out my
subscribers favorite makeup video it's
just I have tried out so many of your
favorites that it's getting really hard
to purchase things that you guys love
that I haven't dry but I'm really really
trying my best and I will do that video
anyway so this is enough concealing my
next step is bronzing usually I was just
going with powder and then I would start
bronzing with powder and then powder
highlight and all of that but I have
just been loving cream products recently
I know that's weird
I still haven't fallen in love with a
cream blush but I have been loving cream
products especially for my dry skin
leaves so I'm gonna take the one Wild
mega cushion contour this is my favorite
cream bronzer from the drugstore this
and the cover effects liquid bronzer
they're the best liquid bronzers ever
but this is way cheaper than the cover
FX one and I in love it it is so so good
just gonna take my sponge and I'm gonna
dip it into the Kanto and I'm just gonna
start blending this it's really easy to
blend out and just try to apply it less
and then build it up slowly and if I'm
gonna be honest with you since I don't
have foundation on I really don't even
think too much about this step I'm just
trying to warm up my skin a little bit
since I just concealed my under eyes and
I just want a little bit of a life to my
skin I even put a little bit on my nose
here on the sides of me and leave it you
know everywhere I normally do this first
but I'm just gonna take my agave lip
balm from bite Beauty this is the best
lip balm ever whenever you want to put a
lipstick on top or whenever your lips
are extremely chapped cuz it creates
kind of like a thick layer but it's not
a Gracie thick layer like it stays in
place this is amazing so now I'm gonna
go in with a little bit of cream
highlight I've been skipping blush when
I've been doing this look just because I
kind of do this in a rush and I I don't
know I've just been skipping blush like
but for cream highlighting I'm gonna
take the hourglass vanish highlighter
stick I'm not sure the exact name but
this one is called champagne flash I
think this is the lightest shade if I
take a little bit on my finger and then
pop that on my cheeks this is such a
beautiful natural highlight and it just
looks like it's one with the skin it
doesn't really emphasize texture all
that much it just gives you like a nice
glossy dewy look I also take some of
this on top of my eyebrow because in the
Sun it just looks so pretty like when
you move your head around and then now
I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
powder underneath my eyes but I'm gonna
be very precise with this because I
don't want this power to go anywhere
else on my face I'm gonna take my cover
FX perfect setting powder this is a nice
powder especially if you have dry skin
because it doesn't really emphasize your
dryness it looks nice and smooth and it
kind of reflects light a little bit like
there's a little bit of something to it
and I'm gonna be taking my Real
Techniques setting brush we're gonna
shake this up a little bit of this and
set
I want to make sure I'm not touching my
cream highlight because then that I'll
just like mattify the highlight and then
it's pointless I'm also going to drag
this right around my nose like this
right here because I don't want this
area to look too dewy but it's also like
my driest area so I'm only applying a
little bit I know this is a lot of steps
and this seems very excessive but now
I'm gonna go and set the rest of my face
with this but I'm still gonna be
avoiding this area right here I'm gonna
set pretty much everywhere else and I'm
mainly doing that to add just a little
bit more coverage and just add a little
bit more life to my skin I have fallen
back in love with the bare minerals
original foundation this is their powder
foundation I haven't used it in so long
and I just recently picked it up again
and I love how this looks on my skin I
feel like I love it more now than I did
before but I got the shade medium beige
and basically what I do is I'll take
some on my cap like this is perfectly
fine and I'll use this powder with one
of these brushes these are always my two
gold tooth if I want coverage and I want
to set my entire face I'll use this it
cosmetics number two to five complexion
powder brush but when I want just a veil
of something I'll use something like
this makeup forever at one to two brush
and I'm gonna just take some of this in
the cap and I'm gonna start buffing this
around my bronzer and around my
highlight
and I like doing this because this is
just gonna set everything we applied
it's gonna look nice and fabulous all
day and I love that this powder doesn't
really mask or cover the highlight that
I applying on my forehead like you still
see that glow shine through this powder
okay so we are pretty much almost done
that is all I do with my face but I like
to finish off the look with a setting
spray especially a long wearing setting
spray like my Urban Decay all nighter or
this one that i meanyes right now this
is the Milani make it last setting spray
whenever I do like a full face of makeup
and I have a lot of glam going on I'll
usually go in with my morphe setting
spray that leaves you looking nice and
plump and dewy that's my favorite
setting spray but when I want something
to last a super super long time I'll go
in with something like this I used to
think that this wasn't very long wearing
but after testing it against my other
setting sprays like this does keep my
makeup on all day and I know it has
alcohol in it
but I don't use it all the time and I
like doing this step right after I
finish all my face makeup and before I
apply my mascara
so now for mascara I'm gonna take a knee
liquid lash extension the mascara from
thrive cosmetics it's so easy to remove
at the end of the day that honestly I
don't want to wear anything else and
this one is enriched black which is
called Brin all of their products are
named like after girls I haven't found
anything named Kathleen
I'm gonna pop this mascara on my top and
bottom lashes
I like lots of light cheese okay so I
just wanted to show you my skin one more
time up close I love this freakin
highlight I know that hourglass is a
very pricey brand but I just love how
natural it looks on the skin like it
looks like it's my skin I love it really
quickly I'm gonna pop on a lip I'm gonna
take my colour-pop lippie pencil in
Lumiere and I'm oh gosh I need to I need
to sharpen these painting I'm just gonna
over draw my lips a little bit with this
now the lip part always changes for me
most of the time I'll wear like a really
bold lip like live from colour-pop or
I'll just put on some chapstick honestly
it changes every single day it depends
on what mood I'm in but I love that with
this look you can really play around
with your lip color and I love lipsticks
and like lip colors it's my thing
alright and now for my lip color I just
wanna like dab something on my lips
press it in and just be good to go
so I'm gonna take this BH Cosmetics and
it's my rayray collaboration she
extended her collab with BH Cosmetics
she came out with a lip gloss this
liquid lipstick and I think a brush
holder everything looks really really
cute I love it and this is the liquid
lipstick like I said and it's called
rosy ray and what I'm gonna do is just
take a little bit on the back of my hand
and with my finger I'm just gonna dab so
moma lips and this kind of creates like
a stain effect on your lips because it's
a liquid lipstick it's gonna last all
day but it's not gonna get cracky or
crumbly or wear down because you're
applying very little and it's kind of
mimicking a stain okay guys so that
completes this video this has been my
current go to face routine basically for
the past couple days like a week and a
half now I've just been loving this
fresh face look hopefully I gave you
