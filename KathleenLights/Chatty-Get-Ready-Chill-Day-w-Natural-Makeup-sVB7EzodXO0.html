a chatty get ready with me I'm just
gonna sit here and talk to you guys and
put on some makeup I was feeling really
really down today for some reason I
don't know why it actually runs in my
family
just sometimes I wake up and I'm like
sad for no reason nothing will happen
and I'll just feel down it's so weird
and today was one of those days so I
thought okay I'm gonna drink some coffee
stay in my t-shirt I got this in New
York when I went to Central Park
it says Central Park baseball anyway I
decided that I was just going to sit
down and start filming and start talking
because it kind of helps me feel better
if I'm talking to someone even though
nobody's here right now so I wasn't
planning on wearing makeup today I'm
just gonna put on like everyday natural
makeup but there is actually a couple of
things that I have never tried before so
it's going to be like a first
impressions and one of them is a
foundation and I'm so freaking excited
but before I get started I want to tell
you guys what's on my brows because I
really really liked it so la girl came
out with new brow pencils they're called
the LA girl shady slim brow pencil I'm
wearing the shade medium brown on my
brows right now and I really really
really loved it it went on super smooth
it's not too waxy and not too creamy I
like how it created like fake looking
brow hairs I just I was extremely
impressed off a first impression if you
like la girl I think you might really
like this so super impressed with that
and I'm so happy that that's affordable
and I've gotten so many questions
recently to do an updated browser
routine and honestly nothing has really
changed except I do kind of like a more
feathery look now I love the look of
just like feathery brows I love it and
honestly this is my guy right here I've
mentioned it in the past so I don't want
to go in too much detail but the mr.
Bragg room by Givenchy is the best brow
gel I have ever used in my entire life
it keeps my brows up keeps them feathery
looking all day I even like it more than
the Anastacio one obviously is Givenchy
it's so pricy Tessa's spins I know but
when I recently tried a bunch of luxury
makeup this is the one that stood out to
me the most it's amazing I love this
brow job okay moving on oh no I have a
feeling this videos gonna be like
hours-long okay I'm just gonna pick my
hair up so that it's not in my face and
I'm going to prime my face using my
Imani perfect ten primer serum I
recently spoke about this in a favorites
video but I realize I just really
haven't used it on camera and I love
this primer you can get this at Target
it's the strangest primer because it
goes on kind of like a serum but it's
like sticky every time I rode my face it
gets red so don't be alarmed I love it I
find that no matter what foundation I
put on top it really sticks to this
primer because it is kind of like a
tacky base awesome and it the only thing
I don't love is that it kind of has a
gun
earthy scent has a very natural earthy
scent but that's because it has like
pure natural ingredients in this love
that has a pump really nothing bad to
say about that excite a weird like grass
like sand okay so for foundation I'm so
excited I just recently got these in the
mail this is from la girl as well this
is their la girl pro coverage HD high
definition long wear illuminating
foundation look how beautiful this
packaging is almost identical like
almost spot-on with the Make Up For Ever
HD you know I'm gonna grab it so I'm
sure you okay not identical this is the
Ultra HD but the old HD that was in this
packaging was like just like this so
they send me four colors but none of
them were perfect so I might mix these
two this is nude beige and this is fair
fair is definitely more you know what
fair might work for me oh they also came
out with the white one which is so
exciting because you can mix this in
with any foundation to make it lighter
like if you have a foundation that's for
your summer shade but now we're rolling
into winter you can mix it in with this
I mean I haven't tried the formula yet I
have one from Manic Panic that I really
really love so hopefully I like this one
just as much or maybe I like it better
who knows I'm not going to use it today
but I will definitely update you guys on
that so I'm gonna take the shade fair
I'm gonna pump some on the back of my
hand
it's very runny not like extremely runny
but definitely not thick you know what
that's probably like my exact shade
actually I'm gonna take my pure sponge
so I wanted to talk to you guys about
the whole Jane the Virgin thing if you
follow me on social media you will know
I recently went to go visit the set of
Jane the Virgin and let me explain how
it happened because I actually have a
video going up really soon on my channel
I don't know if it I think I'm gonna
post that video first so you would
already already seen it one day while I
was in California I was staying at the W
Hotel and when we walked outside like to
leave
I noticed that Justin Baldoni was like
standing close by and he plays Rafael on
the show Jane the Virgin if you haven't
seen that show please watch it the first
two seasons are on Netflix it's really
really good so I saw him of course
I freaked out because I'm such a fan of
the show and then Danny went up to him
he was like hey can my wife take a
picture with you she was like really
nervous to ask you and we took a photo
and then I posted it on on Instagram and
a lot of people were like commenting and
tagging him so he was like who is this
like yet obviously he did I wasn't like
hey what's up man it's kathleen our
youtube channel you know I didn't tell
her many of that I had tweeted one day
like oh my god I would love to go see
Jane the virgin like see the set I would
love to see like where it's filmed all
of that and he actually reached out to
me and told me that he would give me
kind of like a little mini tour of the
set naturally I had a heart attack and I
was allowed to go on set and meet a few
cast members from the show so I got to
meet Gina Rodriguez which is Jane um
Justin again and who forgot I forgot how
to say her name she has a very beautiful
name she's the girl who plays break it
up I really really really wanted to meet
Julio which is high Mikami because he's
like my favorite on the show but he
wasn't there and I didn't get to meet
Michael either Brett dire or Alba I
really wanted to meet the grandmother
but I was so happy because I got to meet
Jane the Persian and it was amazing it
was such an experience that I will
forever be grateful for because
obviously that's never happened to me
I've never experienced something like
that and when you're such a fan of a
show going on and seeing like the set
seeing them in real life
it was just like crazy it was amazing
and I'm so grateful and he's such a nice
person to actually reach out and let me
do
you know that he didn't have to do that
he's like a famous guy you know hate it
that was so nice back to the actual
video I'm so sorry I'm like rambling so
much so initial first thoughts of this
foundation the coverage is pretty good I
think it covered up a lot I have a lot
of redness right here and it did a
really good job of covering that it does
settle into my lines right here but I
mean what foundation doesn't I hate that
about my face these little wine for your
crazy but I think the finish is really
really beautiful it doesn't look cakey
at all it's very tacky to the touch so
I'm definitely gonna have to set this
down and I will be wearing this for the
rest of the day so I will leave a little
note in the description box letting you
know if it is as long wearing as it
claims to be for concealer I'm just
going to use one of my faves this is the
Tarte shaped ape concealer I'm going to
apply a little bit of light medium and
then I'm going to apply a little bit of
fair right on top and blend is ethene
joining me like what I was saying so um
we filmed me and Justin Baldoni films
like a little video for my youtube
channel kind of like a Jane the Virgin
challenge I will link it below if you
guys have not seen it and I was so
freaking nervous so nervous so stupidly
nervous he asked me like questions of
the show that I would have so gotten if
it wasn't because I was so nervous like
one of the questions he asked me was
what is her Helios show like in season 1
and of course it's passions of Santos
how could I miss that how did I not know
that I would never get that I don't
understand I was sweating so badly even
my mom was like you can so tell you're
so nervous and I'm like thanks mom I'm
gonna highlight my face
a little bit so I'm gonna have a little
bit right there right there I do your
duty I get so shy for everything
especially when it comes to like meeting
people I am so shy so concealer blends
really really nicely into this
foundation I'm gonna set my foundation
down with my RC amino color powder I'm
going to take my Smith 112 brush and I'm
gonna set my face totally use the back
concealer as an eyeshadow primer by the
way
okay so obviously now that I have
powdered my face it doesn't have a dewy
finish anymore but I don't know about
you guys let me know in the comments I
really really really like the finish I
think it looks so beautiful so natural
but covers really well which makes me
really excited about this white one so
I'm gonna go ahead and do just the rest
of my face makeup since my eye makeup is
so simple I'm gonna bronze up the skin
using these you a bronzer in the shade
Sun Tan an oldie but a goodie and I
decided to bust it back out again this
is a hakuhodo brush that I bought at
IMATS because I thought it was on sale
but it was not on sale and I was in the
middle of talking to a subscriber when I
purchased it without looking at the
price so that was totally my fault but
what can we do the damage was done I
actually wanted to go back and return it
but Danny was like just don't return it
you really liked it just is fine it's
fine a little bit to my nose for blush
I'm gonna use the bomb beach blush by
the balm seriously such a good blush it
goes with everything I love this and it
lasts a really long time I'm going to
take the same brush cos what is
for highlight I'm actually gonna take
one of the new makeup geek highlighters
this is such stunning packaging oh I
love it she has so many new fun colors
some are duochrome but I'm gonna take a
little bit of Midnight Sun and I'm gonna
take a morphe 27 brush it's an eyeshadow
brush well I'm going to highlight wedi
I'm just gonna add a little bit right
there just a little bit I'm actually
gonna go over it with another highlight
after I'm done with my eyeshadow so just
gonna add a little bit of this okay so
for eyeshadow I'm so sorry I know you
guys are so sick of me using this but
I'm going to use my morphe palette
because so many of you guys have been
telling me to do oh my god honey just
let one rip right now oh my gosh
I ate it like I feel like I tasted it a
lot of you guys have been commenting and
letting me know that you want to see
like an everyday look with this like a
very natural everyday look so that's I'm
going to do I'm gonna start off by
taking my Sigma e-40 brush I'm going to
dip it into this shade right here and I
always start off with this shade this is
my go-to transition shade in this
palette then I'm going to take a smaller
crease brush this is the r37 and I'm
going to dip it into this mustard shade
right here and I'm going to focus this
more on the outer corners but I'm also
going to drag this into the crease
now I'm going to take this Matt bone
color with my morphe r42 and I'm going
to focus this on the inner parts of my
eye it's not going to do much it's just
going to brighten up a look a little bit
on the inner corners it's going to pull
it together look a little bit more
finished I'm going to use that same
brush with this shimmery highlighting
shade and pop that on right in the inner
corners then I'm going to mix those two
shades that I just used and apply some
underneath my brow bone now I'm going to
take my zoeva 227 brush and I'm going to
dip it into this color right here and
I'm going to apply some of this on the
outer corners just add a little bit of
deepness to the look just a smidge
kena Rodriguez was so nice I can't stop
thinking about how nice she was she
seems like a really cool person I follow
her on snapchat okay I mean you never
really know and she is so much nicer
than I thought she would be I mean I
knew she would be nice but she's like
even better so kind and so down-to-earth
and so was Petra she was really really
sweet - really funny for my lower
lashline I'm just gonna take the first
shade I used on a little pencil brush
this is the Luxy 217 and I'm gonna run
that underneath I really wish I got to
see like the V&amp;amp;O of a house like um
where jane lives but we got to see like
a set tour of the Marbella and Rafael's
like penthouse suite and like the
hallways of the Marbella it was so cool
to see it in real life and how different
it looks in person and on camera now I'm
going in with a different pencil brush
this one is a little bit less stiff it's
the morphe 36 going in with that mustard
shade adding it right on top and then
I'm gonna go back into this pencil brush
and I'm going to take the cool tone gray
brown and I'm going to focus this just a
little bit on the outer corners
and that's it that is like my everyday
look with this palette so easy and
simple but it gives a little bit of
something to the eyes okay so now I'm
going to apply some mascara and I find
my Kiko mascara anywhere so I'm going to
use this this has become my favorite
mascara for my lower lash line
it's the trish mcevoy high Volume
Mascara in jet black I bought this on
Amazon it is awesome it's one of those
tubing mascaras which I've never truly
loved in the past because they're not as
volumizing as I would like them to be
but I love the concept of them it's so
easy to take off to be mascaras you just
rub a little warm water on them and they
come off in like little tubes it doesn't
smudge it doesn't get like black
everywhere so I have been loving this
for my lower lash line it's like amazing
but I've never tried it on my top lashes
so hopefully it's good it's just so tiny
it looks like it wouldn't work for me on
my top lashes but we shall see okay so
not my favorite for my top lashes it's
nice I just like something that makes
some look a little bit thicker but I
love it for my lower lashes it's like
amazing okay so to further highlight my
face I really want to highlight my face
on my morphe e49 bridge right on top of
that makeup geek highlight
a little better a little more glowy I'm
actually going to pop on a little bit
more of Midnight Sun by that same brush
red at the top oh yeah
so for lips there's actually been a ton
of new lip releases over came out with
new liquid lipsticks these are all so
beautiful they're in the mauve purple
family really really nice
but I want to use this look at this look
at this this is color pop and Hello
Kitty color pop just came out with an
entire Hello Kitty collection honestly
if this would have been around when I
was a little girl I would have flipped
my shiz I was obsessed with Hello Kitty
when I was little I'm still little but
you know and I was literally look how
beautiful you have highlights eyeshadows
blushes and then you have ultra matte
lifts ultra glossy lips ultra satin lips
and some lippie stix they came out with
a ton of new things so I think I'm going
to use the never teen I think I'm going
to use the ultra satin lip in the shade
tiny tongue tiny to change and then on
top I want to try out this ultra glossy
lip this is in the shade Katie and it is
a sheer formula so let's try them out
this is the satin lip oh they went back
to their old applicator they change the
doe foot applicator to like a fuzzy one
but I think they went back to their old
applicator this is a little bit more
purple than I was anticipating there
pretty color now I'm going to take Katie
ultra glossy lip on top
so I thought it was going to be a little
bit more glittery since there's a ton of
shimmers in this lipgloss but I actually
really like it it just gives your lips a
beautiful light shine I'm really really
into this I think it's so pretty this
would look amazing on top of a really
nude lipstick oh yeah okay guys so that

Virgin talking I apologize for that but
