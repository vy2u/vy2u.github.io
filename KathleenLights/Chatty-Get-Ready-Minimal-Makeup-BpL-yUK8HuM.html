should be kind of like a simple video
where I just sit here and chat with you
guys and my hair is an absolute mess but
today I was just sitting down and I was
watching Dancing with the Stars right
now like the most recent episode and I
was gonna sit at my vanity right now and
just put on my makeup really quickly
like minimal makeup and I thought maybe
I should film it so for today I'm gonna
be showing you my version of the no
makeup makeup look like very minimal
makeup like my Altidore products I
really do not wear makeup everyday a lot
of you guys may notice that like in my
past vlogs or like on snapchat but this
is what I do when I know I'm gonna go
like to Sephora or something or I'm just
gonna be running errands all day and I
just want something on my face I'm not
ashamed of going out barefaced ever but
just when I want a little something as
soon as I'm done with this video I'm
gonna brush my hair actually just made
this smoothie right now it's bananas
pineapples coconut milk um and a splash
like a splash of natural orange juice
and it's delicious very simple like I
mean in like five seconds one good tip
when you want like your smoothie to be
like super thick and delicious if you're
using bananas or like any fruit like cut
up your banana the day before and then
put in the freezer and then the next
morning use your frozen bananas cuz it
makes it like thick and ice like you
know like delicious I wrapped a bit
today okay so I have already like
prepped my skin basically I put on
moisturizer and I apply it in my first
day beauty triple remedy I do t triple
rimoni underneath my eyes this kind of
cancels the dark circles a little bit
and it cools the surface and like deep
puffs I love this I swear by this so
that's all I've done so whenever I'm
gonna go out the door I need to do my
eyebrows because I just I don't like to
be without my eyebrows Feldon I wasn't
lucky enough to have like super
deliciously full eyebrows on its own I'm
going to take my NYX micro brow pencil I
have been loving this this is a serious
dupe for the Anastasio brow is and I
have mine in brunette
so I'm first going to like just brush
the hair in place and typically when I
do my eyebrows I take three steps to do
the brow Wiz and then I apply a powder
on top and then I set my brows but since
I'm you know minimal make-up whenever
I'm just going out the door I don't
really put the powder on top so I'm just
going to fill this in and most of the
time I like to go full on Lily Collins
you know I like me some cara delevingne
eyebrows but today I'm going to try to
keep it that's it that's Arad's posible
these dogs and honestly I like to apply
the powder over top because sometimes I
feel like just of the brow Wiz or this
alone can be kind of patchy so when I
don't use powder I try to brush the
harsh lines like with the spoolie side
so I'm just taking that and I mean
honestly when I have like five minutes
to do my makeup I don't sit here and
make a smoothie and do all this I'm just
you know chatting with you guys so I'm
doing it a little slower they're really
matched today but you know what they say
cousins not sisters so then I just go
ahead and set my brows I personally have
to set my brows with a brow gel because
the color fades throughout the day no
matter what I used
and my favorite brow gel ever is the
Anasazi one and I like the tinted one
I've heard really good things about the
clear one but the tinted brow gel is my
favorite and I use brunette and this
kind of fills them in a little bit more
like they make them I don't know it just
makes them look a lot nicer than a clear
brow gel and it sets in place all
freaking day so good okay so I don't
wear foundation on a daily basis I don't
find the need to if you are going to
like recreate this tutorial or whatever
and you feel like you need foundation
absolutely where a girl there is no
shame
in our game girls boy whoever's watching
it so I'm just gonna go ahead and skip
straight to concealer I use concealer
all the time it's like my Holy Grail
product over foundation um and I've
always done this I actually filmed this
video like a long time ago
when I first started my channel oh look
who I saw said hi guys a puppy oh just
nobody boy oh stop trying to kiss me
my goodness and your mother look who's
here to say hi Oh what shirt you got on
today size isn't everything no he's no
no he's not my baby my baby my what do
we will talk to the dogs like that or is
it just me so whenever you guys see me
doing my tutorials you know that I like
that really highlighted right under I
look and honestly on a day-to-day basis
I don't like that I really like that one
I'm going for like a full face of makeup
eye shadow contour blush all that but
since I'm going very minimal today I
want to take a concealer closer to my
actual skin tone and not so like bright
and light under my eyes so I'm using the
light neutral shade from The Naked skin
concealer from urban decay and I am just
going to apply this right under my eyes
to cover up my dark circles I feel like
just concealer under the eyes makes a
world of a difference for me so I'm just
gonna apply like that I'm not going to
do like you know the triangles I'm going
to cover up like I have redness around
my nose and on my thingy I have a
birthmark in the middle of my forehead
and then I'm gonna have like a few
blemishes here because I recently just
did a facial and like you know your skin
kind of freaks out after a facial now I
have darkness around my mouth
I love this concealer because it dries
like matte not like a super drying thick
mat it's very lightweight very thin but
the finish is actually really really
natural and it's not like dewy or greasy
so to me it lasts all day on my skin I'm
actually going to take that concealer on
my eyelids as well um I have to do this
no matter what even if I'm just putting
on mascara because this really covers up
all the veins and the darkness I have on
my eyes on my eyelids like it's super
veiny so I like to take my concealer and
kind of just like mask that
okay so this next step is just simply to
avoid creasing and so that the concealer
can stay in place I'm just going to set
that using my Maybelline powder in 1/35
creamy natural I use this all the time I
love it just going to set that because
if not it will crease just a little bit
I find that that concealer doesn't
really crease but either way I just have
to set it with a powder
I don't really set the rest of my face
like the concealer on my forehead or on
my nose just because my skin is so dry
oil doesn't really break through at all
okay we are almost done just three more
things everybody's different in this
aspect I feel like my sister can go out
with just blush on and no bronzer like
when she's doing her minimal makeup look
she'll just put on blush and walk out
the door I cannot do that I need a
bronzer I cannot just apply blush and go
I need Rhonda that is my number one
thing I will skip blush a hundred times
over but always go for blonder so I'm
going to take this stippling brush this
is from stigma stippling brush is ever
do a fiber brush the f50 these brushes
apply product a little bit softer so
it's perfect for a look like this and
I'm gonna take the Jane cosmetics
bronzer and inspire I want this because
it's a little bit warm and I'm not
trying to like contour my cheekbones at
all so I'm just gonna apply this on the
places I would contour um but just to
warm up my skin in the summer I like to
do this with a more shimmery bronzer uh
you know the same look with just add a
bronzer with a little bit more shimmer
but today I was feeling inspired
I'm gonna take that everywhere just give
my skin some life okay so now that is
just I'll let my hair whoa
just just a little bit of color back
into my skin
nothing crazy not like full-on bronzer
but just a little bit of something it
just prevents me from looking like
washed out okay and then lastly I just
do two more things I put on some mascara
and I put on like some lip balm and
that's all I do and I feel put together
like I feel like it is definitely enough
so I'm gonna take the telescopic carbon
black by L'Oreal I have been loving this
I really love using a super volumizing
like intense mascara when I'm doing this
look because I feel like it brings a lot
of attention to my eyes and I don't even
have eye shadow on so I really like this
this gives length and volume like I am
very impressed like just just too little
too little swipes I don't know I love
this mascara this is a perfect bottom
lash mascara - it's like perfect for
both because it is so skinny you could
just like get right up in there by the
way did you guys watch well do you guys
watch Dancing with the Stars for those
of you who did you see how amazing it
was when Noah proposed to his girlfriend
like how crazy was that oh my god I
cried so much I was so emotional he
loves her so much she could so tell it's
like so beautiful okay so we are
officially about to be done at this
point when I'm done doing this I
literally most of the time just slap on
a chapstick or if I forget to do that
and I'm out and about I literally just
put on the first thing I see in my purse
um but I really really like using
something like this this is the fresh
sugar petal lip balm it is a tinted lip
treatment it has SPF 15 your lips are
actually like one of the most sensitive
places on your face and people forget to
put SPF on them by the way whenever I do
this look and I'm out in the Sun like
I'm going to go run errands
in the Sun I put on my moisturizer has
SPF before I freak anybody out
I don't know if like the original fresh
sugar lip treatment is worth the price
because these are like nineteen dollars
but I think that these are the ones I
have a tint because you get the best of
both worlds you get like a really thick
moisturizing lip balm that really really
soothes your lips has SPF and you get a
color it's not just like clear so this
one's my favorite in the shade petal so
I literally just slap that on and then
that completes this no makeup makeup
look I really hope you guys enjoyed it
this is just my version of the no makeup
makeup I don't know if it's too much
makeup for some people or what but it's
literally very simple I do it in five
minutes when I'm in a rush thank you
guys so much watching I love each and
every one of you thank you thank you
thank you from the bottom of my heart I
love you okay I'm getting weird so yes
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video hi
I'm gonna go finish my smoothie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
