a chatty get ready I'm gonna be testing
out some products I recently got I'm
gonna give you my thoughts on them my
first impression I realized my last
video was a first impression but this is
more of a chatty get ready just using
new products I haven't tried before I
also want to talk to you guys about KL
polish there are things I've been
meaning to talk to you guys about so I
will leave that for the end of this
video I already know this video is gonna
be like 45 minutes long but lots of
stuff to cover in today's video
so I got a ton of new stuff recently
what in wild just released a bunch of
new stuff I was on the website a few
days ago and I bought a ton of stuff I
also have some PR not everything in
today's video I purchased myself I will
let you guys know what's PR and what I
purchased throughout the video my lips
are so dry okay let's begin with our
face I'm gonna put this on I just got
this from forever 21
it's my new little headband I know I
just recently got my other one bow and I
saw this on the website I was like I
have to have that so I'm gonna start by
priming my face and recently Urban Decay
released like about two new primers they
came out with four primers that do four
different things but as I look at them
there really isn't one that's for dry
skin like this one it's smoothing and
environmental protection it has SPF 30
this one is the self adjusting one has
adapting pigments soft focus effect and
shine control this one is the optical
illusion primer and it has rose hip and
argan oil it's smoothing and pore
perfecting this one is probably gonna be
the most hydrating one because this one
right here is the D slick pore
minimizing and mattifying primer I wish
they would have released one that was
like really dewy and hydrating and
moisturizing but even this one with the
argan oil doesn't feel hydrating it
feels like a typical pore filling primer
so I don't know actually think I'm going
to use a different primer that I just
recently got SPR as well this is the
Beca first light priming filter I love
their backlight priming filter so this
one in first light seems interesting
it's a very cool purple shade this one
is just supposed to be an instant
complexion refresher these purple shades
are really good to brighten the skin I'm
actually going to use this one this one
hasn't launched yet I don't think the
Urban Decay ones
I don't think this one has but the
foundation I'm gonna use I think I would
I'm gonna prefer a primer like this my
face always gets red when I rub it so
don't be alarmed so this one feels
really nice my skin feels very hydrated
and it kind of gives you like a pearly
look to the skin I don't know the
difference between this and their other
primer honestly they kind of feel the
exact same way for foundation I'm going
to be testing out the new wet and wild
photo focus foundation I cannot tell you
how excited I got when I saw that they
released these wet and wild is probably
my favorite drugstore brand it's one of
the most affordable and I feel like they
just know what they're doing I feel like
they get their audience I didn't get the
matching concealer to try out because I
read a lot of negative reviews about it
now I'm kind of regretting not trying it
for my label this was so inexpensive and
I was shocked at how nice the packaging
is it doesn't have a pump but it has
like this little spatula thing and I'm
gonna mix two shades cuz that right
there is too dark for me I picked up the
shades soft beige and soft ivory I
didn't really know what my color was and
I did this online so hopefully hopefully
it won't be terrible I don't know the
smell is really strong it reminds me of
the scent of the Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation that paint scent just going
to blend that in the color is not
terrible
okay quick tip the foundation dries a
little fast so you might want to work in
sections oh okay so I'm going to add a
little more to get more coverage
it definitely dries really fast you do
want to work in little sections because
I had a hard time blending the
foundation on my forehead I had to swipe
at the Beautyblender patting it in was
not doing enough okay so this is the
foundation on my skin what do you guys
think I do think the undertone is a
little bit off I don't think you could
tell on camera but in person you could
tell a little bit the finish is nice I
would say it has a medium coverage I
don't think it's full coverage at all
you can still see certain things peeking
through and I did add a second layer to
my cheeks and the finish is really nice
it has a satin finish I don't think it's
too matte but I don't think it's duly
any part that looks dewy definitely has
to do with the fact that I applied this
primer under for sure it feels tacky
when I put my fingers to my face which
is weird because I didn't think it would
since it's not overly dewy so that's one
thing I don't like but aside from that
it looks really pretty it looks like
skin it's building up a little bit
around my nose but that happens to me
with a lot of foundations but not bad
the more I see it on my skin the more I
like it for concealer I'm going to take
the number seven radiant glow concealer
I just recently purchased this and I
haven't heard anything about it I got
mine in the shade number ten and it says
it's a light reflecting motion to chase
away under eye shadows and reduce the
appearance of puffiness and a type all
organic light reflecting lotion that's
weird
I've already squashed it but it's one of
those clicker thingies and when i
swatched it on the back of my hand it
looked like something I would really
like but you never know
oh my gosh I think I really like this it
doesn't have much coverage but I think
this is gonna be a really nice concealer
for days where I just want to run out
the door because it's very lightweight
it's not too dewy not sticky it almost
has like a satin finish and I kind of
like how it looks
excuse the shadows forming on my body
I'm actually filming this at almost
midnight
so I don't have any natural light like I
usually do I like this concealer it
literally looks like I have nothing
underneath my eyes like you don't see
any product builds up it is like
coverage you can see my dark circles
right there Selina actually scratched
the crap out of my face the other day
almost took my eye up so I have a scar
right here underneath my eye so it looks
a little bit darker right here as
opposed to this eye I don't know I'm so
used to my Tarte shaped tape that has a
super EXTREME full coverage but I kind
of like a minimal concealer look on days
where I'm not really wearing makeup I
also wouldn't say it's radiant or glowy
I think it has a pretty natural finish
for powder to set my face I'm gonna take
this bad boy here I'm really excited to
try this because it swatches beautifully
on my hand like the formula feels really
nice this is the Wet n Wild photo
focused pressed powder it's brand new I
got the shade warm light
I'm gonna take my smith one-one-two
brush and I'm gonna use that to set my
concealer and my eyeball where I applied
concealer I'm gonna take a bigger brush
this is my a cosmetics complexion powder
brush and I'm just going to set my
entire face with this powder because the
foundation was a little bit tacky to the
touch I want to make sure everything
blends nicely on top
I'm usually very very picky for powders
but it feels really natural on the skin
it's not as natural and it's not as skin
like as the Giorgio Armani one or the
Charlotte Tilbury one but it has a
similar effect
Wow so far so good with this one
impressed I'm gonna go ahead and jump
into my eye makeup I don't know why I'm
doing it in this order because I've
already applied my base products but
that's what we're gonna do okay so for
my eyes I'm gonna try out this palette I
haven't used this yet I'm very excited
this is the persona identity palette so
not here on YouTube just recently came
out with her own makeup line and this is
her first release it's a beautiful
beautiful palette I'm so excited to try
this out on the back it says it's the
ultimate palette for brown eyes so if
you have brown eyes you might really
really like this
I've only swatched these but they feel
really nice and buttery whether I cannot
say the word buttery without thinking of
that little old man so I'm going to take
this shape charming I'm gonna use this
as my crease shade have you ever seen
that commercial well they're kind of
like bloopers of a commercial with a
little old couple and the man is trying
to say buttery flaky crust oh my gosh if
you guys haven't seen that please when
you're done watching this video all
right now go right now search up buttery
flaky crust
it is so funny so now I can't say
buttery without saying buttery buttery
crispy his wife is like Dan play Dan
right that's his name
oh I'm gonna take the shade chic right
here it's the matte purple and I'm gonna
put this on my entire lid I totally have
should have done my eye makeup before I
did my face what was I thinking
have you guys seen the show Westworld
dan and I just finished season one and I
feel like that's the new show like
that's the big buzz going around and I
really really like that it was really
interesting a very smart show I love
Anthony Hopkins so much and it was
really really good I just didn't knock
my socks off the way I feel
it knocked everyone's socks off you're
probably looking at me like what I don't
know Danny felt the same way like we
finished season one
like that was really good but it wasn't
the best show I've ever seen you know it
definitely looks like season 2 is going
to be way better I'm not even sure when
that comes out as season 2 come out yet
it has a few moments where you're like
oh I didn't see that coming which I
really like but it wasn't like you know
I don't know what do you think I'm sure
I'm the only one who feels this way
well me a day I'm gonna do kind of like
a halo look so I'm going to take the
shade fearless and I'm going to add this
to the outer corners and to the inner
corners leaving the center bare
and then I'm just going to connect it at
the top I'm going to take that first aid
we use Charming and I'm going to use
this as my crease shade again just to
blend everything out taking some more
fearless and just deepening everything
out I'm going to take the shade
seductive right here and I'm going to
play this with my finger and I'm just
going to blend that I'm going to use the
shade humble to highlight my brow bone
I'm going to take a little bit of the
sassy shade just a little bit of this
and apply a hair right on top and then
I'm going to apply that same shade and
my new coolness so make up forever
actually sent me there New Starlet
liquids they're just these tiny two
bottles that look like nail polish
they're basically just like liquidy
glitters for your face for your eyes I
said you can use them as highlights but
I think they're a little bit too
glittery for that they came out with
these and then they came out with
pigments that look like this I'm
actually gonna use one of the glitters
I'm gonna take this shade right here in
number two and I'm just gonna apply some
of this to my eyes I'm gonna just like
oh should I just apply with my we'll see
okay okay gives a little something
okay not into this glitter not into this
glitter when I tapped it in it
completely took off the eyeshadow I had
underneath you could see this skin on my
eye grand said I didn't really use a
primer I just used this concealer but I
don't have that problem with any glitter
I use and yeah no bueno
no bueno I have to play around with
those more but how if you think I'm
gonna like the pigments more than those
glitters I'm just going to apply some
more of that seductive shade since it's
like gone now I'm gonna add a little bit
more fearless to the outer corners and
then we're pretty much done with the
eyes I just have to do the lower lash
line for eyeliner I'm gonna use the
Anastasia Beverly Hills darkside
waterproof gel liner I have used this
before I really like it I have so much
follow up I'm gonna take the shade
charming and on this morphe r41 brush
I'm gonna run that on my lower lash line
by the way my morphe palette comes back
oh my gosh I completely forgot to
mention that I will post this video on
Friday so today my morphe palette came
back and suck today as you are watching
this if you are watching this when I
post it hopefully it doesn't sell out
like it did last time it sold out so
fast it was extremely unexpected I have
never had a collab sell out like that
ever so I just I didn't expect it I'm
gonna take the shade fearless and I'm
going to run that really close to my
waterline
so the eyes look really grungy
definitely with an eye look like this I
prefer 100% full coverage concealer I
don't think this concealer has enough
coverage for this certain eye look but I
still love the concealer I'm gonna apply
some mascara I'm gonna try out the new
wet and wild lash renegade mascara this
is like the coolest mascara bottle
they've ever come out with hopefully I
like this I don't know I don't typically
like wands like this I've only really
liked one wet'n wild mascara and it's
not my favorite anymore it was the
yellow one but I feel like they changed
the formula and screwed it up so this is
two coats of the mascara it's not bad
it's definitely one of their better ones
it isn't my favorite though I have
mascaras I like more it's not really Wow
me so I'm gonna go over it with my Kiko
extra sculpt volume mascara okay so the
eyes are officially done I'm gonna go
ahead and do my face well finish my face
I don't have a new bronzer to try so I'm
just gonna go in with my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer I do have a new
brush to try I just recently purchased
this at Ulta it's the it cosmetics
heavenly luxe radiance wand I saw it and
I thought it was so cool I love this
like soft touch handle I think it's so
nice and I feel like you can use this as
blush as powder as bronzer I don't know
I'm excited to try this I'm just gonna
bronze up the skin
so for blush I'm actually going to try
this out this is the two-faced sweet
peach glow peach infused highlighting
palette
it smells like peaches I have the eye
shadow palette and I know that there's
been like some crazy controversy with
Too Faced recently with the whole like
peach palette but I wanted to try this
out on camera because I know a lot of
you guys recently picked this up but I
was looking at the reviews on Sephora
and a lot of people don't like this so
I'm a little bit nervous I'm gonna take
some of the bronzing shade which is like
a very glowy warm bronzer you just it's
almost like a highlighting bronzer my
kind of like that I think it's gonna be
so pretty in the spring and summer I'm
gonna go ahead and pop on this peach
blush I'm gonna take the same brush but
I'm gonna clean it on a napkin and I'm
gonna pop this on my cheeks I know it
doesn't really go with my mommy purple
silver eye but whatever I will say
though this blush will totally emphasize
your pores like this made my pores come
out and play I like it it's just it has
that Sheen to it it will emphasize your
pores if you're not careful and I'm not
gonna use this highlight because I've
already swatched it and I know I don't
like it it's just too glittery for me
and not my thing but I really really
love these two shades specifically the
bronzer which I thought it would be my
least favorite but to highlight my skin
I'm actually gonna take this guy right
here I recently placed an order on
Beauty lish calm and they had this
little tiny thing for zoo I didn't even
know this existed this is a powder
highlighter by hue and it's in the shade
ice which I thought they only had three
shades but apparently they have one
called ice and it's a mini version but
when I went on these UA websites check
it out it's not there so I don't know if
this is like brand new I don't know
what's happening I get the are from his
away but I got so excited when I saw
this that I just bought it I love this
formula so much is probably one of my
favorite highlighting formulas that I
wanted to try it out and this
color in the shade ice looks white but
it has a really strong pinky gold reflex
it's definitely a metallic dual chrome
highlight so let's see what it looks
like I've never tried it so pretty
very nice
and so Sophia was like a little baby
Lulu okay so all that's left to this
look is my lip color wet and wild
recently released new lip liners they
are the perfect pout gel lip liners I
bought two shades I got never pedaled
down which is this really pretty pink
and I got bear to comment which is a
nice pinky nude I'm going to take a bear
to comment and I'm gonna line my lips I
haven't tried this formula I haven't
tried any of these things it's very easy
to apply it just like glides on your
lips
so the formula on this is very very
creamy really easy to maneuver which
makes me believe that it's not going to
last as long as a typical lip liner
would but it feels really nice it feels
really comfortable and not drying
whatsoever it's one of the most creamy
lip liners I've ever tried actually
which I don't know if I like that or if
I don't okay and how exciting are these
when in wild came out with more liquid
lipsticks I wasn't a huge fan of their
dark ones but I really loved their light
shades and their red colors so I bought
six of them I am so excited to try this
one out this is like me in a tube I'm
obsessed with red orange shades or
anything with any orange in it but for
today I'm gonna try out one of the more
muted shades these are the Wet n Wild
mega last liquid cat suit matte
lipsticks and I love the color selection
very neutral wearable shades this one's
really cool ooh that's really cool
it's called nudie patootie that's cute
I'm just gonna mix the two colors
together so that it's not so great
I actually really like the color that
created okay so that's a really good
thing about this nude lip liner the fact
that these lip liners are so emollient
and so creamy they actually work really
well underneath liquid lipsticks because
it makes the liquid lipstick a little
bit less dry and it mixes in well with
the liquid lipstick so that's something
I really like about this I might use
these as like my liquid lipstick lip
liners this color is really pretty and I
love how it pairs with the lip liner but
I can already tell that it's like
cracking here they're a little bit more
drying than what I would like but my
lips were really really chopped today so
I will test these out a little bit more
and I'll probably get back to you in a
favorites video I'm actually gonna put a
lip gloss on top because I've been
wanting to try one of these on camera
these are the new two-faced sweet peach
creamy peach oil lip glosses I've only
tried one color on my lips and I was
blown away by the formula I can't even
tell how good it is
lipgloss but it feels so hydrating it
feels like a creamy oily lip balm but
not greasy I don't know I really liked
it I'm gonna take this shade right here
called Papa don't peach and I'm going to
apply it right on top oh my god they
smell so good they smell like peach a
fake peach but peach I smell like my
childhood something when I was younger
used to smell like this oh my god you
know what it kind of smells like it
smells like the candy that you used to
get at the mall that was in a gumball
machine and they were like hard little
fruits like a tough like a hard little
banana a hard little apple or pear or
whatever this smells like that it
probably was a little hard peach in
there somewhere okay so that completes
this try to get ready I really like how
this look turned out I wanted to take
this time to talk to you guys about kale
polish if you're not interested in that
then goodbye I love you so much I will
see you in my next video but I really
wanted to just sit here and get a few
things off my chest and talk to you guys
how long has that been bothering you so
as I'm sure you guys know there were a
few setbacks with the kale Polish launch
if you follow me on social media on
Twitter or Instagram you would have
already known we had some major shipment
delays and there were so many things
that contributed to that I can't even
begin to tell you first of all I'm so
sorry for those of you who pre-ordered
and didn't get your order in time I know
how frustrating that must have been
I feel like us me and my subscribers I
really we have a really good
relationship so I want to sit down and I
want to explain it to you and I want to
talk to you guys so first off we had a
major delay with the manufacturer which
meant we couldn't ship out pre-orders
when we were supposed to and I had no
idea that this was going on because that
was something to do with fulfillment you
know that's shipping because of this
huge delay there were people who ordered
on launch day who were getting it before
the people who pre-ordered which is
insane to me I can't believe that even
happened it really doesn't make sense in
my mind why things were shipped before
orders that were placed before when I
found out this was happening I
personally sat down and I wrote an email
to all of you guys who pre-ordered if
you pre-ordered from Kay polish you got
a personal email from me pre-orders are
amazing
they are executed the right way and
unfortunately it just wasn't and it's
all on me at the end of the day this
falls on me I take full responsibility
and then there were a few customers that
couldn't get their order in time for
Christmas which breaks my heart I have
been in the world's worst mood the
entire month of December I was in the
worst funk ever decal polish Instagram
was just blowing up with so many
concerns from you guys and I was just
writing everything down I would read a
comment write it down I was just
disappointed in the way the shipment
went and I'm so sorry I made the mistake
of launching December 5th I don't know
what I was thinking because that is the
busiest time for shipments the busiest
time the holiday season and I have never
launched a brand before this was a huge
reality check for me so now I know and
things will go smoother from here on out
you're doing everything we can to make
sure that our next launch in the spring
or our next launch whatever that is will
go smoother and will go faster I know
there are no excuses but it was my first
launch and it's it's still it's still a
learning process for me customer service
is my main priority and thank you guys
so much for reaching out to me and
letting me know that my customer service
team has really helped you out and how
nice we've been that is my main priority
so thank you guys for being so
supportive and so kind and so
understanding I'm so sorry if your order
took a long time to get to you I'm
working on a way where that never
happens again so again please forgive me
another thing I wanted to mention I have
been writing down notes ever since they
launched and ever since I've been
hearing reviews my next batch will be a
hair like a hair thinner it's still
gonna be the same formula same long
wearing formula because I love my
formula I think it's amazing but certain
colors can be just a hair too thick
still very opaque they're gonna be very
opaque on two coats and it's still gonna
be long wearing the formula is not gonna
change just the viscosity is going to be
like this much just like this much
thinner I want to thank you guys for
making 2016 so incredible it was a very
hard year for a lot of us but all I can
do is hope that us as a whole us as
people we have a better year in 2017 I
hope that kale polish just becomes
better and better and better and that
you
I love it even more yeah that completes
this video I know it was super long but
I hope you guys enjoyed it and you
relaxed and you know maybe this video
was something you could kick back to and
just play while you're eating dinner or
something I don't know thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye anyway any was and
it was I love their backlight priming
filter so so weird like washi Yoda fish
fillet no one knows what it means put in
its problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
