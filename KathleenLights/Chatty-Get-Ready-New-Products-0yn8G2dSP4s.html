chatty get ready I haven't filmed a
video in like two weeks and I already
feel out of breath if you guys follow me
on social media you guys know that I've
been sick for a week I was in I filmed
my January favorites like the day before
I left to California and then I was in
California for a full week I was there
for a generation beauty and the very
next day like the day that I got up to
get on the plane I woke up with like a
really nasty cold and today was finally
the day that I was like okay well I have
enough energy to film I'm feeling much
better so I'm gonna sit down and film
I'm doing a chatty get ready because
even though I felt better like I'm still
a little bit out of breath I didn't want
to do like a full-on glam like a makeup
tutorial I just wanted to sit down and
talk to you guys I feel like I don't do
these a lot just because they're so long
like I know this video is so long and it
hasn't even started let me know in the
comments if you like these kinds of
videos and then I'll do them more often
so I wanted to try out new products in
today's video like a lot of these
products I've never tried on my face
before like I've never used them on my
skin some of them I've used already but
most of them I've never tried so I'm
really excited and a lot of these
products are drugstore most of it is
drugstore so I'm just going to take the
hair out of my face
I lost my original little ear thingies
they were like little hearts I lost them
I don't know where they went so I'm just
using these beasts are super tight on my
head I have a big horse head by the way
I told you guys that I was going to do
like a really big drugstore review of
all the new products I've bought in the
past couple months and I am still gonna
do that but I did buy some newer
drugstore products which I'm gonna use
today
oh the lighting the clouds are in and
out excuse me so I'm gonna wait another
week and a half before I filmed that
video just so that I can use the
products a little bit more and give you
like a better review but I am still
gonna do like a huge drugstore update
review so I have two new primer sprays
I'm so excited
told you guys on snapchat but I bought
these at Ulta this one is from NYX and
this
is from Physicians Formula and I don't
know which one I'm going to use this is
the NYX first base primer spray and this
is the Physicians Formula primer Argan
where argan oil with coconut water
primer I don't know I think I'm going to
use the Physicians Formula one just
because I'm going to use this Milani
foundation and this Milani foundation
when I pumped it on the back of my hand
is thick I'm scared that this is gonna
be cakey for my dry skin so maybe this
will help I'm gonna use this I'm just
gonna spray this on my face let's say
I've never tried this though oh I ripped
that days bad doesn't this man I really
like the spray on this I had a feeling
it was just gonna be like chicken like
oily but it's not so I'm just gonna let
that set me feel oh my gosh it feels so
nice
it doesn't feel greasy or oily at all
for it being argan oil oh my gosh this
feels really nice okay I don't know if
it's gonna prolong my makeup probably
not wha what did you see that fly - just
try to kill me okay so I'm still gonna
put down like a primer type of product
and I just bought this at Ulta as well
this is the NYX born to glow
illuminating primer so you guys know I
was born to glow I've never tried this
before by the way so I'm just applying
this this kind of reminds me of the mac
strobe cream it has like that same
pearly finish maybe not as pearly oh my
gosh this feels really nice though okay
so I'm going to be using the Milani
conceal in perfect 2 and 1 Foundation
and concealer I have mine in the shade
light beige this is too dark for me so
I'm going to mix it with this this was a
recommendation from one of you guys I
love buying things that you guys tell me
to buy I love it so I got this off of
Amazon I had never heard of it before
before a subscriber told me about it
this is the Manic Panic dreamtone a
vegan flawless foundation and color
corrector this is basically like the
Manic Panic foundation I didn't even
know Manic Panic made foundation I
thought they just made hair dyes but
this is their white foundation
in the back it just says virgin it says
whitest white you just add this to your
foundation to make it lighter and I have
this this is the bodyshop lightning
shade of dusting drops and although I do
like this I find that it changes the
texture of my foundation which sucks
because then I can't get the most out of
the foundation because it like alters
the consistency I know a lot of people
love it a lot of people say it doesn't
but I find that it does change the
consistency and I haven't used this yet
on my face but I do like how it feels on
the back of my hand it just feels like
it's just like a creamy product that
isn't going to change like my opinion on
the foundation so anyway I'm just going
to pump out a pump of this I love the
packaging it's in a glass bottle and I
love that it has a pump so I'm just
going to do like one pump on the back by
hand and you guys can see how thick this
is this is so thick it's not even
running so thick I move right away and
then I'm gonna do just like a little
bait that the white just legally I'm
gonna blend that with a finger I'm just
gonna pop it on my face maybe I should
have had a little bit more white it's
alright we shall see but it did lighten
it a lot so I don't know how much of
this um I need of this foundation it's
so thick I'm so scared and then I'm just
gonna blend that in with my pure sponge
I got a lot of questions about this in
one of my recent videos this is a sponge
from the brand pur cosmetics but you
could only get it if you buy like
they're contour stick and to be
completely honest I don't like their
contouring stick I gave mine away but I
love this freaking sponge so please pur
please put this to where you can buy it
without the contour sticks please
because it's such a great sponge oh oh
my gosh I'm talking way too much this is
ridiculous okay I wanted to tell you
guys this I tweeted about how I bought
this new Beauty Blender type thing from
the brand lush minerals I kept the box
so I can show you and it was a ten
dollar sponge I had amazing reviews on
the Amazon website like people were
raving about it let me show you what it
looked like when I washed it
look at this like this is terrible it
just it doesn't even bounce back I don't
know how people love to this it was well
I cannot use that so that was my opinion
on that okay so now I'm gonna blend it
in I'm just gonna spray my ultra
radiance a little bit's already wet I'm
just gonna spray it a little bit just to
make it a little bit more wet II yeah I
could have used maybe like another drop
of that white foundation it's okay we
tried to fix it with concealer okay um
not bad I thought it was gonna look a
little bit cakey but like around my nose
it's not really kicking up that much um
all foundations pretty much cake around
my nose I feel like no matter what I do
to hydrate around my nose my the area
around my nose is the driest and no
matter what foundations cake the only
foundation that 100% does not take up
around my nose as they make up forevers
face and body holy grail foundation the
best foundation I've ever used that is
the only one that doesn't do that but I
mean I'm used to it most foundations do
but this blends really really nicely
into the skin and it was like sitting on
my face for a while I was scared that it
was gonna be one of those foundations
like the Revlon Colorstay where you have
to blend it in immediately
hey that blended in so easily wow I
really like this foundation I mean I
don't know how long it lasts but it I
feel like gave me full coverage it was
easy to blend even though it was thick
it doesn't look cakey oh and I mean it's
a little bit tacky actually but wow it
looks really pretty I would say this is
like a satin finish and I used an
illuminating primer at an argan oil
spray so I can imagine this is probably
like a matte foundation but since I used
those products underneath it's giving me
like a nice satin finish okay so now I'm
going to do concealer I just recently
bought this at Ulta as well this is the
Physicians Formula BB concealer argan
where it's like give me a Latin vibes
like hardcore I got mine in the shade
light/medium it's too dark for
underneath the eyes so I'm going to mix
it with my wet and wild highlighting and
concealing pen and ivory into you I love
the name by that so this is really
strange it comes in like a little spongy
thing which I'm not a fan of it's like
weird never use this product before
either so I'm going to use the sponge to
kind of like drag it down it feels very
light like it's gonna have light
coverage I don't know how I feel about
this this sponge soaks up so much of the
product it's not like the maybelline
sponge on there concealer like the I
don't know ah we shall see when I blend
it out though feels very lightweight now
I'm going to take the Wet n Wild
highlighting pen and drag it down I love
this little highlighting pen so much and
so cheap then I'm going to blend it in
with this side of Zee sponge
okay so right off the bat I can tell
that this Argan concealer is very very
hydrating and I can tell it has like the
argan oil in it cuz my under eyes look
wet okay so I'm going to set that
immediately because I feel like this is
gonna be a crazy mess I'm gonna take my
morphe 48 brush and my our CMA no color
powder and I'm gonna set me face
I'm also going to set the rest of my
face because this foundation is already
getting into like my forehead line and
here especially foundation always
creases in like my smile lines so I am
going to set the rest of my face because
this foundation is tacky like I feel it
on my not that I feel it on my face but
when I touch my face it's tacky so
products probably will not blend easily
on top unless I said it I'm gonna use a
bigger brush won't take I'm going to use
my Too Faced mr.right perfect powder
brush oh my gosh this brush guys guys
guys this brush is everything Oh
everything ok so first impressions not a
huge fan of this so I'm going to contour
my face and I'm so excited I'm so
excited
makeup geek released her new contour
powders I'm so excited they are bigger
than the UH no Stassi account or powders
and they're cheaper I know I'm very
excited so I have all the cool shades up
on top and then the warmer shades down
at the bottom and I prefer per for I
prefer a more neutral contour powder
because I just feel like if I go a
little bit too ashy with my contour it
just looks like I rubbed dirt on my face
supercool tone colors don't look good on
me I'm actually going to take a
combination I've never used these before
I'm going to take this brush right here
this is the luxe e54 2 flat contour
brush and I'm never use this brush
before either I'm going to take these
first two colors and I'm going to mix
them breakup which is cool pores
can I speak cool porcelain and then I'm
taking love triangle which is one
porcelain and wish me luck oh well hello
Omega V I'm going to take a little bit
more of the warm one and add it on top
and off the bat first impressions these
are easy to blend very easy to blend and
I definitely like the combination of the
a cool shade and the warm shade together
oh my god that looks so crazy on camera
doesn't look like that in person you
need a very light hand definitely tap
off the excess product but my gosh these
are so pigmented and so easy to blend
very buttery the lighting is really
weird in this video because most of my
life is coming from here this is like my
natural light and like my artificial
light is coming from here so this side
of my contour looks so strange but bear
with me I'm still trying to work out my
lighting situation so I'm using a little
bit of the cool force cool porcelain if
I say that weird
I'm using a little bit of the cool
porcelain but mainly dipping into the
warm porcelain feel like it's more
flattering for my skin tone okay so now
I really want to bronze up my skin and
I'm so excited okay I'm so excited to
use this bronzer you guys have no idea
this is brand new I just bought it at
Ulta this is the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer the packaging is my
favorite Physicians Formula packaging
I've ever seen in my entire life I love
this like I love this color I like it
the green so what's really cool about
this is that it is made with Muru Muru
butter I don't know what butter that is
but it's like some Brazilian butter I
don't know but this smells my nose is
stuffy at the moment but I can still
smell it this smells like a piña colada
this smells so good the best smelling
bronzer ever and I'm pretty sure it only
comes in one shade I hope this is
permanent let me use it first let me see
if I like it oh my god I love it oh I
like it because it's like a neutral
color as you can see there's not a lot
of warmth in it but it's not like a grey
bronzer but it has a little bit of a
sheen not a sheen don't get scared
it has a little bit of a natural glow to
it so it's not like chalky or anything
by the way this is the wet and wild
brush I don't know what it's called
because the name was on the packaging
and I threw that away of course they're
seriously probably the best of the
drugstore and they are the cheapest I'm
sure feel like my contour on this side
looks a little bit choppy right here
and I don't know why cuz on this side it
looks fine hmm I don't think I like this
that much I think it gave me like a
weird harsh choppy contour my face
smells like a pina colada
face so I'm gonna highlight my face
first before I put on my blush and this
isn't a new product I've been using it
non-stop I love this so much it's
quickly become one of my favorites this
is the pure afterglow illuminating
powder I bought this off of Amazon I
could have bought it off the pure
website but my friend Laura raves about
this she says it's her favorite bronzer
highlight and I had to get it because
she raves about it I'm using a zoeva
luxe face focus one 1/4 that is
beautiful I love it because it's gold
without being gold my freaking lighting
okay so I'm going to go in with blush
now I'm going to use my Laura Geller
blush and bright in blush in pink
grapefruit is multi it's like it's
really similar to Mac um warm soul but a
little bit more rosy chapter tool I used
the five one for to put my blush from
Luxy okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and
do my eyes I don't know if you could
tell like this side of my face looks
weird the center my face looks a little
bit more structured like things are like
oddly blended here I'm a little bit
confused but we're going to move on so
I've already kind of like primed my
eyelids with concealer but I'm gonna
further prime with the NYX glitter
primer and I know that this is like for
glitter I really want to test it out and
I want to see if like the eyeshadows
stick to this better so we've never used
this before and I'm really excited feels
nice and sticky by the way I want to
thank you guys um whoever I met at
generation Beauty seriously it was
amazing to meet everyone oh my gosh
guys are so nice even like there was
like security in the back and they were
telling me like wow you have the nicest
subscribers ever and I was like I know
they're the best people ever this is so
sticky crap Ola probably wasn't a good
idea to like use this as a primer
apparently none of my screws are screwed
in today so I'm just going to set that
with powder I'm going to use the
covergirl true Naked Golden's palette
but most of these colors are shimmery
I've never used these on my eyes so for
like priests work and all that good
stuff I'm going to just dip into the
makeup geek contour powders so I
actually don't know what the heck I'm
doing I'm just going along I'm taking my
morphe MB 23 and I'm going to dip it
into this warm porcelain
there was this one person I met at Gen
Beauty who made me laugh so hard like
she came up to me and she was like
before I take a picture with you before
so how do you I want to thank your
husband for his service and like Danny
was sitting there and he she was like
thank you so much Danny she's like I
wanted to do that before I hugged you
because he's more important than you and
I was cracking up and I was like ah
you're so right I found it like so
inspiring that she like thanked him for
his service it was so sweet she was
still nice if you're watching hello how
are ya I loved you thank you for saying
hi you guys were so nice and your makeup
like everybody's makeup was so amazing
and everybody was coming up to me with
like these intense wings and like these
beautiful smoky eyes and I was like oh
my gosh
I look like crap next to these women and
guys there were a few guys there so
thank you guys for coming out to see me
it meant the world to me I'm going to
take my Sigma e25 and I'm going to dip
it into the half-hearted warm medium
contour
you
I'm going to take bad habit which is
warm fare underneath my lower lashes by
the way I would just normally use like
brown eyeshadows but I have them put
away and this was like sitting right
here so I'm using it
this is a zoeva luxe pencil 230 love
this brush so because I was sick and
like vegetating in my bed the Direct TV
people haven't come yet so I don't have
like actual TV I've just been watching
Hulu and Netflix and I had nothing to
watch I was like I'll caught up on my
shows nothing to watch so I just started
watching um Jane the Virgin and I didn't
think I was gonna like it I don't really
like like I don't know I didn't think I
was gonna like it but I actually liked
it I think it's pretty funny and I feel
like I can relate so much because it's
like a Mexican family it's about like
her Mexican family and her when I not
and even though I'm not Mexican I could
still relate like I feel like it's such
a funny like Hispanic show I mean even
if you're not Hispanic I think it's
pretty funny and I don't know it's the
narrator cracks me up I don't know I
think it's I think it's cute it's a cute
show I think I'm gonna take this color
right here it's like this really pretty
olive color and i'ma put that on my
entire lid hopefully this comes out
olive on my lid and not like caca Brown
mmm mmm breasts so far oh my gosh that's
coming out so beautiful I don't know if
it comes off on camera but it has a
really pretty olivey sheen I have to be
completely honest I'm not like a big
cover girlfriend I think it's one of my
least favorite drugstore brands but this
palette so far is impressing me way more
than the freaking Revlon one or the
Maybelline one I think I like I mean
I've only used one shadow but I do love
the Milani one and that one is probably
hard to be I love the Milani palettes
all of them I'm going to take this zoeva
two to four brush and I'm just gonna
buff that out
I wonder how this would work wet like
how these would work wet so I'm going to
try that I'm going to spray mac fix+ is
my coconut one I purchased like 75 of
these when the coconut one came out yep
and I'm going to dip it into the
eyeshadow but up here at the top because
I don't know how this works wet and I
don't want to like mess up the eyeshadow
man I'm getting a long fall out with
this eyeshadow which is why I always do
my eyeshadow first because it avoids all
the fallout I mean you still get the
fallout but you don't have foundation on
so it doesn't really matter okay so
adding fix+ just added a little bit more
intensity adding a little bit more of
the really like warm contour okay to
highlight underneath my brow bone I'm
going to take this like vanilla shade up
here at the front and then to highlight
my inner corners I'm going to take this
gold shade right here oh they have names
on them I'm gonna take Sunkist that's
the gold shade woohoo
that's beauty for oh my gir that's
beautiful and I want to make it a little
bit like lighter so I'm gonna take this
one even though this looks like super
glittery let me see this looks super mmm
I don't like the shade I don't like this
tray Oh
so I'm going to take my pure highlight
and I'm going to add some more but that
gold shade I put in my inner corners
would be beautiful all over the lid with
my morphe seventeen I'm going to add a
little bit of this chocolate shade on
the outer corners just a little bit of
this
I'm going to add some eyeliner to my
waterline this is like my favorite
eyeliner of all time I've gone through
three full eyeliners of these and that's
no.4 no no like three of these is the
best this is a Mac coaster reach I cool
this is amazing for green or hazel eyes
I mean anybody can use it but you know
what I mean oh I gotta sharpen this I'll
try
no but get a stroke I don't know if you
can tell it just makes you can't tell
I'm going to make green eyes pop so much
especially if you have hazel eyes and
you have like a little bit of green in
your eyes and you want to emphasize the
green Mac Costa reach best eyeliner ever
this is the first eyeliner I ever ever
ever purchased when I walked into Mac
when I was like 16 cuz all I wore when I
was younger was eyeliner and the girl
was like you need Costa reach it's gonna
help like make your eyes look greener
and she was right ever since that day
thank you a girl at Mac and then I'm
going to take this bronzer shade right
here this is called ginger and I'm gonna
blend a little bit of that underneath my
lower lashes after that I'm going to
take the chocolaty color called Sierra
and I'm going to put this only on the
outer parts of my eyes here I'm so sorry
this video is so long but just in case
you're getting ready you're going out
tonight getting ready for school
maybe I can keep you company for 45
minutes okay so I'm just gonna curl my
lashes we are done with the eyes these
are the tweezerman eyelash curlers I
bought these on Sephora because I saw so
many good reviews and I have to say I
think I like these more than my shoe
amaura eyelash curlers so I'm going to
try out a new mascara today this is the
essence lash princess false lash effect
mascara
and you know me especially today I'm
skipping the falsies I get comments all
the time like I really wish you would
wear falsies in all your tutorials like
do they just look so much better like
come on like you know like work a little
harder try a little more and I don't
skip falsies because I'm lazy sometimes
sometimes I skip falsies because I just
prefer to skip falsies I don't think for
me please do not get offended for me
it's not realistic for me to slap on
falsies every single day this is nice
this isn't cutting it for me I'm going
to go back to my trusty Kiko extra
sculpt Volume Mascara my favorite
mascara at the moment so that's why I
don't wear falsies in all my tutorials I
do use falsies and some of them but not
all of them I love this mascara I'm
gonna show you guys something when your
lashes get so clumpy this is amazing
don't stab yourself you will hurt
yourself this is the morphe b71
and i just comb out and they're my
clumps are gone it's amazing this little
comb for my lower lashes I'm using the
Mac extended play gigablack lash those
ears were severely hurting my head they
gave me like a little dent right here
okay so we are pretty much done with the
face just going to go ahead and pop on
my lip color this is the sephora rouge
gel lip liner in the shade the nudist
this is kind of like a purple nude and
it kind of makes me look dead but i
really like it with the olive and then
i'm going to pop this on top which kind
of like subdued the deadness a little
bit this is my favorite gloss of all
time buxom zweite russian okay guys so
