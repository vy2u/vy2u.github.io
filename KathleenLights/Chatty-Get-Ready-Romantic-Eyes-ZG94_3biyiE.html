so today's video is going to be age
Haddie get ready my windows open ignore
the sounds of nature I didn't really
know what I wanted to film I just knew
that I wanted to sit down and use a
couple of new products that I just
recently got I got these two new elf
brushes and I really want to use them
for the first time on camera
the ultimate blending brush and the
contouring brush which I have high hopes
for the contour brush this one feels
amazing as it is but so I wanted to use
these on camera for you guys give you
guys my thoughts because they look great
and honestly I didn't know what I wanted
to film I just know that I want
something like feminine and romantic and
I wanted to sit down and talk to you
guys because I feel good I feel really
good right now
guys I have my nails painted my nails
are plated I said that I would not paint
my nails until my house was completely
painted because every time I painted my
nails and I went to go paint a door or
paint something in the house they would
just F up my nails really really badly
so I don't know if you guys have noticed
but in my past videos like all of this
month my nails have been bare and it has
been killing me because I just love
painting my nails so my nails are
painted which means I am finally done
painting I am finally done painting a
lot of you guys have been noticing in my
recent videos that I'm just super
stressed out and just like um not
connected not 100% here and it's just
because I've been so stressed out with
painting it's it's a lot guys getting
things ready and just putting things
together and settling into a new home is
really really stressful but then I feel
committed to YouTube and that I have to
post videos so I was just not there a
hundred percent but I'm back baby I am
back
I just I'm in a good mood I'm ready to
film I'm ready to get back into the
swing of things this is not going to be
my background the thing is that I
explained it in a previous video but I
broke my
right and I cannot film with my desk
behind me until I get it because it's
just off but as soon as I get my ring
light in the mail which should be very
soon because I had to send it back so
they could send me a new one or so they
could fix mine as soon as I get my ring
lights back in the mail I will film just
like my old setup um you know like back
in Mississippi like I have that same
exact setup in this room just right over
here so as soon as I get my ring light
the old background will be coming back
okay longest intro ever I'm sorry I was
supposed to film a prom makeup tutorial
yesterday but I woke up with my face
completely in a rash like all of this I
was using a new oil it was like 100
percent tamaño oil to man new oil I
don't know how to say that that's
supposedly really good for the skin I
have very sensitive skin I guess I had
an allergic reaction and all of this I
still have redness as you can see and
it's still like itches like it's still
you know I still have the allergic
reaction but when I woke up like I got
up and I went to the bathroom and I went
to go wash my face and I was like I had
like a home alone moment I was like oh
what is this my whole face was
completely red and Celine head-butted me
and cut my lip so yeah we're off to a
great start so I assumed you guys in a
little bit this isn't a tutorial or
anything but I June do en I'm gonna go
ahead and prime my eyes using my
painterly paint-pot as per huge this
video is gonna be long I just know it I
just know what I am going to use a
palette that I really really have been
loving I've had this for a while I
bought this in Mississippi I've had this
for like a while um but I haven't wanted
to use it because did you hear a beep
did you guys see that okay I haven't won
I haven't had coffee today guys which is
very very rare for me but I feel like
I'm just on a natural high today baby I
haven't wanted to show this on camera
because it came in like a limited
edition set I got this it's that
Christian gray collection that makeup
forever came out with it was on Sephora
like I
I'm not a big fan of the Fifty Shades of
Grey book at all but I saw the palette I
saw the lipstick and I fell in love with
that set this is what the palette looks
like these are like regular makeup
forever i shadow it comes in this little
quad and it's quickly becoming like one
of my favorite little quads in the
entire world
hello my friends yeah Doty mirror and
I'm hoping that makeup forever will
release these eyeshadows individually so
you guys can get them or I hope that
they are that they are sold individually
already I don't know I hope so it has
the names the little numbers on the back
side will tell you as I go but if they
still have this collection at your
Sephora pick it up
it's as fancy okay it's this massive but
it has this it has a I shot know it it
has this it has mascara it has a lip
gloss and a lipstick and it's more bang
for your buck like you actually save a
lot of money because they're all like
full-size products so the first thing
want to do is I'm going to take a
blending brush and I'm going to dip it
into this really pretty like purple gray
color this is I 628 guys I film with my
window open now and I'm serious like
things just get weirder by the day they
do my so um I got a comment the other
day that said you're way too neurotic to
watch or something like that like they
called me neurotic and I laughed so hard
at that comment because I am I am
neurotic I'm pretty crazy I'm pretty
Gracie but that's okay there are plenty
of other youtubers who are normal I'm
filming the prom tutorial tonight like
I'm going to wash off my makeup well I'm
going to wear this makeup for the rest
of the day and then tonight before bed I
just feel like filming a problem
tutorial so that video should go up
before this one so you should have
probably already seen my problems toriel
I'm going to take this beautiful
beautiful shade this one here it's my
favorite it's one 5i5
yeah I 5-1 for like iridescent I think
that's what it means a lot of people are
asking me like why I took so long or why
it's taking so long to paint doors
guys I have we didn't even paint walls
we left the walls I painted this room
this room was yellow so I painted it but
we left all the walls the same all we
did was paint doors like door frames we
painted the ceiling and then we painted
I don't how to say that in English stuff
up yet to the wall the ball I don't know
it's like crown molding but for the
floor corneum is and it took forever
because I was in charge of painting the
doors right because I'm too short to
paint the ceiling and stuff like that so
I was in charge of painting the doors
which seems like an easy task
but okay so this this house is very very
small but it has three bedrooms and each
bedroom has a closet like this and each
closet has two doors and then they also
have a door obviously you can't see it
but of you know adore so each room has
three doors to paint right the closet
doors in the regular door so that's
already nine doors with the three
bedroom bedrooms plus the two doors for
the two bathrooms plus the front door
and the back door plus the two pantry
closets plus there's another extra
closet in the living room that has two
doors so that's like a million doors and
each door had to have two coats on each
side whatever I did the math and turns
out I painted a door 68 times 68 times
okay I never want to paint another door
for the rest of my life so I really love
how this eye shadow looks on
own but I'm going to spritz a little bit
of fix+ cuz you know me I am extra fix
plus I love fix plus by the way a lot of
you guys have been asking me what I
think about the Smashbox primer water
and honestly I just think it's fancy
water like I don't wanna don't you hate
it when like seven you're everything's
connected your phone in your computer
color just blend that out a little me
again with that gray color you would
never think that this like gray would go
with this like pinky rose gold that's
what I was looking for rose gold that's
what I meant to call it would be weird
if I filmed my entire video with this
accent
that'd be strange now I'm going to take
a pencil brush and I'm going to dip it
into this forest green shade this is s
five five six and with that pencil brush
I'm going to kind of smudge it really
close to my lash line
so do you guys watch The Voice what is
in my eye
do you guys watch The Voice who are you
rooting for I really love Cory the
country boy because he gets too
emotional when he talks and very
passionate about what he does and to me
those are my favorite kind of people
like really like inspiring and like when
he sang the Tim McGraw live while you
were live like you're dying song he was
like very emotional I cried the whole
performance because I'm dramatic I'm
going to take this little like angled
brush this is from Sophie three-30 and
it's one of those like angled brushes
that I never really use but I'm just
gonna pack this on the outer V and kind
of swoop it in as why I never use those
brushes because I don't really like I'm
gonna take my Dell iam tool 776 pretty
much the same thing as a Mac 217 only
much much cheaper much cheaper I'm going
to go back into that rose gold shade
with the same brush sprayed a little bit
more with fix+ and just intensified the
like inner part of the lid with the same
brush I just cleaned it off I'm going to
highlight my brow bone with this
beautiful highlight shade this is m6 one
- it's super intense and on my inner
corners as well this is a beautiful
inner corner highlight it's so nice
ok so it looks a little crazy a little
ugly right now but it all comes together
with you know mascara not good stuff and
I'm not going to do that till I'm done
with the rest of my face like I'll do my
lower lash line and my mascara not one
of them's on my face oh I need I need to
pull my hair back
I like 10 so recently make up forevers
sent me the new step one primers and I'm
going to use one today one that I really
I've tried like half of them and I'm not
even kidding like they're one of the
best primers I've ever used I have to
address this because somebody commented
this to me earlier and it kind of like
not upset me but just because the
company sends me something it does not
sway my decision or what I feel about
the product I did a video dedicated to
disappointing products and some of those
products were sent to me by companies
and I talked about how they were
disappointing and how I didn't like them
if I don't like something listen and
live in a free country I can say what I
want I say what I want no one's gonna
tell me what to say about their product
so I'm always gonna be 100% with you
because I used to be a viewer I mean I'm
still a YouTube viewer but before I made
videos I used to watch videos and buy
things on people's recommendations all
the time and I'm not gonna pretend like
something is good when it's not and then
you spend your money on it
that's not very nice so I'm always gonna
be 100% with you guys no matter what
gets sent to me what doesn't I buy a lot
of makeup and then I do get some stuff
sent to me but I do buy a lot of makeup
I buy most of my makeup so anyway back
to this these are great great primers my
favorite one is the hydrating one or the
nourishing one since I have dry skin but
because of the situation that I have on
my face thanks to that stupid oil I'm
gonna use the green one and this is the
redness correcting primer and I'm not
kidding this thing freakin works like I
don't know if it's gonna work for my
rash but it works for like just my
typical redness I get a lot of redness
anyway so I'm just gonna massage this
onto my fingers not really I'm just
gonna put it on my face so yeah it has
like a green tint that counteracts
redness and I'm not even joking like
it's no no it's really good I freaking
love this primer tell me if you can tell
okay tell me of you can tell if I'm not
just crazy
did it not did it not am I going crazy
but did it doesn't didn't it like
subside my redness a little bit I don't
know
uh-huh yeah I'm talking to myself sir
enjoy your jog okay besides that I am
going to hydrate my face with some fix+
because the foundation I'm going in is a
little matte and I'm a little dry so I'm
going to use my Rimmel stay matte
foundation I haven't used this in a long
time and it's one of my favorites from
the drugstore even though I have dry
skin I think it leaves like a nice satin
like beautiful flawless canvas but I'm
going to mix it in with the cover FX
custom cover drops to get more coverage
because of my redness guys when my
friend sent this to me and when I got it
in the mail I read about it you are not
supposed to use this on its own you're
supposed to mix it in with like
moisturizers primers foundations BB
creams just to give more coverage this
these are just like pure pigments and I
knew that but in my one of my previous
videos I used it by itself because I
don't care and I wanted I've tried it
with moisturizer flawless I've heard of
a foundation flawless and one day I was
just like you know what I'm gonna try by
itself and I did and I liked it because
it's a full crazy coverage because I
mean it's pure pigments so you're not
supposed to use it by itself but you
know me I write the rules here so anyway
I'm going to take my stay matte and true
ivory and put that on the back of my
hand like that the Moosey texture and
then I'm going to take my cover FX cover
drops in g30
and just dots them into that and mix it
right up I'm going to use the elf
ultimate blending and brush
so how are you guys doing oh okay
I haven't seen the newest episode of
flash like the very very new one but the
episode before before this one was in
all before they no one was insane I look
crazy guys I want to know your thoughts
No well man I guess that would be a
spoiler oh I don't wanna spoil it for
anybody but do you guys want him with
her with the best friend I don't even
remember her name like I don't remember
her name and I watch that show that's a
little sad let me know cuz I feel like
sometimes I do that sometimes I'm like
oh now you want to be his girlfriend now
when he's moving on I know you're
thinking you look like a ghost
but I mean in person it's not as ghostly
and also like I haven't and in a long
time I am very impressed with this brush
it buffed it out really nicely I am
digging this so I'm gonna add concealer
underneath my eyes and I'm going to use
these two I'm gonna mix them because I'm
in between what I like I need to make
space to get my perfect shade these are
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I
love them I purchased these I purchased
one of them and then it was too dark and
then I purchased this one and it was too
light so I had to keep them both and use
them both the color selection on this is
Gaga it sucks like I don't know I do not
like the color so I'm taking light
neutral and fair neutral and I'm mixing
them for underneath my eyes the other
night you wouldn't believe
dream on his head and mess you owe me TT
TT TT key
I'm going to use that same brush to
blend things out I'm going to set that
with this elf blush brush and I'm going
to use the elf HD under eye setting
powder I actually have been really
liking this under my eyes it's pretty
good and wait to cheat so does ablute I
just put some on the cap men just it off
and then sit my consider to just finish
up my eye look it's going to be really
simple I'm going to take the green color
and run that under end lashes you know
I'm going to take the tip of this elf
brush into that gray color and blend it
just to make it nice and smoky and then
that completes the eyes I'm just going
to add some mascara I'm not going to do
eyeliner or anything you put it on
falsies but I just don't feel a lot
doing it so okay so the eyes are done
actually like how it really turned out
actually really like always here now
it's like a soft smokey eye because
there's no liner or like eyeliner just
said that I'm gonna try out this elf
contouring brush it's very very soft
it's not too fat but it's not too skinny
I know I have high hopes I'm going to
use the Gerlach take bronzer in Cabo
this is my favorite bronzer of all time
all my second favorite but my first
favorite was limited edition so I never
liked
use it oh okay let's see how it blends
it out I wish it was a little bit
fluffier so it could be a little bit
easier to blend out but if you want like
a super strong a super chiseled contour
then this brush is perfect it's a little
like stiff which I don't like it's a
little harder if this was like a little
bit frayed out more that'd be better
I definitely like this brush a lot more
than this one the only thing that this
is lacking is that it's a little bit
hard to blend but if you want a strong
contour this is your guy like a super
strong this is your guy but this is
all-around amazing that buffer brush
highly recommend I'm going to take this
morphe g 5 and I'm just going to bronze
up my skin more just to give it a little
bit more warmth I'm taking the lorac
tantalizer baked bronzer in matte tan so
what it's like and I'm just gonna bronze
up the skin
okay so I'm gonna put my blush on with
this same brush here and I just bought
this yesterday I've never heard anybody
talking about this this isn't new or
anything but I wanted to buy something
that I haven't seen on youtube yet so
this is the Revlon powder blush in
knotty nude this is what it looks like I
thought it was like a full-on blush and
then you opened and it's like oh it's
one of these rectangles because it came
with a brush but it looks like a really
beautiful color like a natural nude oh
yeah that's really pretty
I like that blush a lot not a nude I
like you for highlight I'm taking my
same blush brush and the elf baked blush
in the pink tastic I can never go wrong
with this highlight and I'm just gonna
highlight my cheekbones I mean look at
that instant instant it's like one of
the best highlighters I have and it cost
me three dollars
I love elf they're so good by the way
this isn't out yet I don't believe lorac
sent me this two of their new tantalizer
bronzers if you want to review on them
let me know I'm mat one in a beautiful
shimmery one so far I love the matte one
it gives you like a sun kissed glow but
it's matte it's great anyway let's move
on to my lip combinate chain I'm gonna
take this Jordana lip liner in it's the
easy liner for lips in rose crush let me
take off my chopstick love these Jordana
lip liners because they are two dollars
and they last forever on my lips they're
probably one of the best lip liners at
the drugstore
and they're probably one of the cheapest
I get Jordana at Walgreens and then I'm
going to take the NYX soft matte lip
cream in Cairo and apply it on top okay
guys so that is the finished look I
really hope you guys enjoyed it honestly
just winged it I mean I've done this
look a couple of times using this
palette or this quad but I think it
turned out really pretty I highly
recommend this blush I hope it lasts on
the skin cuz it's beautiful this naughty
nude and I've never heard anyone talking
about it but I really like the look I
think it's beautiful
what's that mean that's that word so
yeah this wasn't a tutorial was just
