going to be a tiny get ready I haven't
done one of these videos in a really
long time I feel so I've decided that is
what I want to do today and it's also
going to be kind of like a one brand
video not on one brand tutorial because
I don't have a specific look in mind I'm
just gonna chat with you guys and put my
makeup on but it is going to be using
the Sephora collection products I asked
you guys on Twitter recently not that
recently but I asked you guys on Twitter
if you wanted to see a one brand video
using the Sephora collection which if
you don't know it's pretty much
Sephora's brand like Sephora sells a
bunch of different brands but they also
have their own personal brand called
Sephora collection and it's a lot more
affordable than their other brands sold
there it's not necessarily drugstore
prices but not very high-end either some
of these are actually going to be first
impressions some of these I've already
tried by the way I know I know I know I
know I know I know I did not post a
video Monday or Wednesday today is
Friday
I never go this long without posting a
video my last video was a week ago that
is so unlike me but I couldn't post a
video Monday because this weekend was
completely crazy I had no time and then
Monday came and the people who are
installing our closets and the people
who are installing our curtains and
windows came at the same time so I had
people making so much noise here Monday
I couldn't film they had to come back to
finish Tuesday I couldn't film and then
yesterday we had to come back to finish
I couldn't film so today I decided okay
finally I can sit down and film and
yesterday I woke up with a cold but I
was like oh no I'm not gonna let his
stuffy nose and a fever stop me from
filming No so please excuse the fact
that I have a cold
story of my life finally to drink more
vitamin C okay so I'm going to go ahead
and get started I've got my little kulfi
so now that it's officially spring I
bought a new little headband to use in
my tutorials ah isn't it beautiful
I love them my little hearts might make
a comeback next fall and winter I bought
these at forever 21 okay
I'm going to start off with a primer I'm
gonna actually start off with my face
makeup I'm going to be using the Sephora
beauty amplifier afterglow primer and
Luminizer from these two flora
collection all of these products are
from the Sephora brand so I'm not going
to say that every time because I know
that's annoying this product is pretty
new I've never tried it before so this
is like a first impression it comes out
a really beautiful like gold liquid this
is kind of reminding me of the do or Glo
Maximizer that's like super super
expensive this has like a similar feel
to it uh-huh this could be something I
like okay so now that that is on my face
I'm actually gonna go ahead and do my
eyebrows I always do my eyebrows
off-camera but I had bought a Sephora
brow product this is their retractable
brow pencil and it's waterproof and I
got rich chestnut not sure if this
matches me the only thing I don't like
right off the bat when I look at it is
the little comb it's not a spoolie it's
like a comb and I'm not into these like
they hurt it's like a how like
scratching my forehead so I'm just gonna
go ahead and do my brows it's a little
reddish for my brows like it's a very
warm Brown I really really like it I
like it it's really easy to use I don't
like the color it's a little bit red for
my hair do for this video it's okay
like I don't understand why they don't
just put a spooly it's like what is this
little fork now I'm gonna go in with
this Sephora brow thickener which I
don't need this yeah I don't need any
more thickness but it's like a brow
powder it's so strange I've never tried
this before either this is in the shade
medium brown you some Baraka maybe this
will tone down the redness whoa that
whoa whoa you know what this is cool for
sometimes when you use a pencil you kind
of miss certain spots this is really
cool to just go over those spots you
missed or if you have really really full
brows and you only need a little bit of
like something this is pretty cool my
brows are not twins today just regular
old sisters okay so for a foundation I
bought two Sephora brand foundations I
have the perfection mist airbrush
foundation because a lot of you guys
said it was a dupe for my Dior air flash
and then I bought the ten hour wear
perfection foundation I was going to try
this one out today but this is way too
dark for me this is like my tanning
shayden I is not town so I'm going to
use this one I got the shade light it
says it's oil free it has second skin
technology it has medium coverage
paraben free fragrance free formulated
without mineral oil non-comedogenic
sounds great great great so it looks
pretty thick it's not very liquidy we
shall see I prefer kind of like more
liquidy
the pump on this foundation is really
amazing like you could really control
how much you take out okay so that is a
pump and a half of foundation I'm not
exactly sure the finish of it because I
used a very luminizing primer underneath
so right now it's looking really like
dewy and radiant it has some tackiness
to it for sure I'm going to go in with
some concealer this is their bright
future gel serum concealer and I've
heard mixed reviews about this concealer
this is another product I've never used
before a lot of these products
I just bought I heard that some people
like it but the application sucks
because it's the weirdest thing what
product doesn't get on the entire wand
only at the very tip so you do have to
like it's meant to be dotted but you
can't really like rub because no product
comes off so you have to like constantly
dip your wand back into the concealer
which is really weird and kind of
time-consuming so that's kind of
annoying around my mouth my slumber
because I have a cold I do have like
some discoloration on my eyelids so I'm
dragging that on my lids I don't know I
don't know how I feel about that I don't
know how I feel about this concealer
it's a little bit cakey on my skin but
it did blend out nicely mmm okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and set my under eye
concealer I don't have a translucent
powder from Sephora this is their micro
smooth baked face compact and medium
which looks hella dark I'm just gonna
set my face using the NARS translucent
crystal powder I'm going to apply just a
really light layer of this powder to my
face using a wet and wild stipple brush
because I do feel like this foundation
needs to be set it's a little bit tacky
so recently I purchased the bronzing
powder in Los Cabos this is
it looks like I really really love this
but I saw that they came out with a
sculptor like a contour product in the
shade Los Cabos this is still being sold
on the sephora website purchased this
one just in case anybody was wondering
if there's a difference like if it's
exactly the same why are they selling
both of them and they're pretty much the
same color but this one is much more
pigmented let me show you okay so I'm
going to swatch this one is so much more
pigmented this one is a lot softer so I
don't know what the dealio
what that is but today I'm going to
contour using this one because it is a
little bit less pigmented so I don't
want to go in with such a heavy hand I
kind of might prefer this one over the
other one because it lets you it lets
you build up the color but if you aren't
as fair as mean and definitely go for
the like og because it's you'll get a
better color payoff so is anybody caught
up with how to get away with murder I'm
not going to ruin it I'm not gonna say
any spoilers but I don't even know how
to feel about that finale I'm not gonna
spoil it but I do like Frank and I know
that I shouldn't because Frank is not a
good person at all but I do like Frank I
don't know why what is wrong with me and
also side note I am 100% completely over
scandal I was obsessed with scandal guys
like it was my ish you know I was so
team Jake I was all about that show but
now it's just it's gotten to the point
where it's like okay put a lid on this
show and I'm sorry for those of you who
really really still love it I just can't
deal with Olivia Pope anymore she is a
stone-cold biatch I don't know and I
just don't like where the show is going
I'm like so incredibly bored it's a
snooze fest I haven't seen like the last
three episodes how to get away with
murder
scandal no okay so I really really
really like this product it gave me a
very soft natural contour as opposed to
this would be a little bit stronger but
I like
both with a tan I might want to use
something more pigmented I don't know
this is so weird but I don't know I'm
gonna go in with blush next and I'm
gonna be using one of these blushes and
I have the shade can't stop smiling
which is a really pretty peach and then
so shy which is like a nice bubblegum
pink I'm actually gonna go with the
peach one cuz I might be doing like a
regular bronzy I the usual you know it's
not a tutorial now I'm gonna highlight
and to be completely honest I'm not a
big fan of any of the highlighting
products Sephora collection has I tried
one of their illuminators that look like
this like it comes in this packaging and
I did not like it
I have these Sephora radiant luminizing
drops this is in morning light I'm gonna
try to dab some of this on my cheekbones
even though I already applied powder but
whatever okay so I just added a little
bit of something I didn't want to
disrupt my foundation underneath and my
blush which I kind of did so I'm gonna
take the illuminator in this little trio
it's a very very subtle highlight like
you don't get much from this at all
there's not much color payoff at all
like at all actually want a little bit
more glow enos I know that's crazy but
I'm going to take this so for a baked
blush duo in mango bean I love these
like luminous so for blushes they're
amazing add some right here okay so now
I'm going to do my eyes keep in mind
when you use products like this you can
use these wet so if you want even more
intense highlight you can wet this now
I'm going to move on to my eyes I'm
going to do something very very simple
I'm going to use their baked eyeshadow
trio in Indian summer I'm actually going
to use the bronzing shade in this to use
as my crease shade
gonna buff this into the crease I use
the bronzer as eyeshadow all the time
I'm gonna take my brush and spray mac
fix+ on it this is a Mac 239 and then
I'm gonna go into this shade right here
it's a really pretty bronzy taupe color
and I'm going to use that all over my
lid wetting the eyeshadow is definitely
going to intensify it and these baked
products are awesome too wet because you
don't mess up the eyeshadow then I'm
going to go into this really dark
chocolatey shade this is a Sophie 320
brush kind of like a Mac 217 and I'm
going to pack that on my outer corners
not going to wet my brush I only want
just a little bit of depth for my
waterline I'm going to take the
waterproof retractable eyeliner in the
shade deep plum matte deep plum and I've
never tried this before and it's not my
favorite the colour-pop liners are like
five dollars and they are so much more
pigmented than this oh my gosh that is
totally a bust for me I like struggle to
put that on I'm going to blend that out
using the chocolate color
I'm gonna go in with mascara next and I
didn't buy a mascara because I'm a fool
so I'm going to go in with my Kegel
extra sculpt okay so we are pretty much
done here I'm just gonna go in with my
lip combo I'm going with the Sephora
Rouge gel lip liner in the shade nothing
but nude as I haven't used this color
before I just bought it but I have used
this formula and it's amazing I really
love these lip liners this is such a
pretty lip liner I love it
and the formula I love it I love it I'm
gonna go over it with this guy right
here I don't even know what this is
called I just saw it on the Sephora
website and I was like wow that looks
like a really pretty color I don't even
know what the name of it is I don't know
if it's like their lip balm lipstick
thing but it comes in this packaging and
this is in the shade number one yeah I
have no idea
like ooh I like that it's so pretty and
it feels so comfortable on the lips I
had a really good color payoff I can't
smell it cuz my nose is stuffy but I
really like that okay guys so that
completes this look I know that this
video wasn't very chatty but honestly
I'm just under the weather and I don't
feel the best but I had to get a video
up so I'm sorry if I wasn't very
entertaining in this video I'm sorry
some of these definitely were hits and
some of these definitely were misses the
primer amazing it gave my skin really
glowy look I really really like that so
far this town nation looks good it does
look like second skin it's not too bad I
actually think I don't like this cuz all
the places where I applied the concealer
made my skin look a little bit cakey
great brow product if it was less warm
and it came with a spoolie but I really
liked it
and this product is pretty cool too this
is a great subtle contour amazing not a
fan of the highlighting this really
really loved the blush I love their
blushes they're baked ones and their
colorful ones awesome blushes and while
this is really pretty it only works wet
because this brown shade I was having a
hard time like applying it to my
it and I'm also not a fan at all of this
eyeliner but I really really really
really love their lip liner formula and
this like lip balm nude number one thing
is beautiful love it so that completes
this video I hope you guys enjoyed thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
all of a sudden this like they decided
to an and then Monday came and they are
