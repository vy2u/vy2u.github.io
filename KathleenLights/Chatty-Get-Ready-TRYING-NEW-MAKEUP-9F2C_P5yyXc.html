HIV get ready / full face first
impressions I was screaming a lot this
past weekend when I was in the pool and
I feel like now my voice is like in and
out like it wanted to leave but it
didn't so I find that my voice is a
little raspy right now so let's just
look past that there's a few things I
just recently purchased and a couple of
things that were sent to me and I
haven't tried out any of these products
so that is what we're going to do today
and then we're just going to chat and
hang out alright I'm going to jump into
it because we both know this video is
going to be a thousand years long I'm
actually going to put my hair in a bun
I'm going to spray this bad boy before I
start with all my makeup did the
two-phase replenishing primer and
setting spray I was so excited when I
saw this I love setting sprays I have so
many actually want to do an entire video
on setting sprays and mists and which
ones are good and which ones are bad and
all that stuff so I'm going to try this
one out it says it's a replenishing
primer so that's how we're going to try
it today okay extending my hand out a
little bit more because that was
drenching my face okay so I'm just going
to let that sink into the skin it does
it has coconut water probiotic based
ingredients and skin revive herbs and
it's also silicone alcohol and oil free
and I'm totally loving all of that but I
don't know if I like this mist kind of
squirt it a little bit aggressively but
when it comes to primer sprays the mist
isn't that important but I don't know if
I would love this mist as a setting
spray but as a primer I think I'm going
to like this my face actually feels
really really sticky like my eyeballs
are so sticky up here holy crap I'm like
really really sticky I could totally be
a good thing alright so for foundation
I'm going to be using this it just
recently purchased this at Walgreens the
number-7 stay perfect foundation and I
wanted to pick this up because the
number 7 list and luminate foundation is
one of my favorites it's so dewy and
pretty and this one is supposed to be
nonstop complexion perfection all-day
wear and it's supposed to be for all
skin types and has medium coverage look
how cute I look how cute this is the new
Beauty Blender swirl it's like a
can white tie-dye Beautyblender if
you're into the Beautyblender definitely
check it out because I believe this is
limited edition
it's so cute so many music today I'm
just going to do two pumps of this I
also got the Shay warm ivory I'm in that
I'm in that shade in my other donation
this foundation is a new or anything I
mean I don't think it's new but I have
been so intrigued with the number of
seven foundations after falling in love
with that other one
all right so this is two pumps of the
foundation I think it covered up pretty
well I'm just going to add a little bit
more to right here this is where most of
my redness in my veins show but I really
like the coverage and I have to say I
really like this finish it actually
looks pretty dewy
I have a feeling that's because of this
primer so I don't think this is a dewy
foundation by any means but that primer
definitely dude it up which I'm okay
with this doesn't feel too sticky or too
tacky like it doesn't feel like it's
going to slip off and I really really
really like that hopefully this does
wear all day I'm going to leave a little
note in the description box letting you
know how everything more my bronzer my
blush my highlight the eyeshadow palette
everything because I'm not gonna be able
to sit down and update you guys at the
end of the night since I'm going
somewhere today and I actually won't be
back home till tomorrow and I will make
sure next time I do a first impressions
I don't have any plans for the rest of
the day but for today I will leave all
the info below okay let's move on for
concealer I'm going to take a brand-new
concealer I just bought this is the Dior
skin forever undercover concealer I
think this is brand new
I just recently tried out there do your
skin forever foundation and like it's
alright it's not my favorite and I
thought they had concealer so I really
wanted to try it so let's see this is
very very yellow I got the shade
zero-one-one
and yeah it's pretty yellow but we'll
see just in case I'm going to do one eye
smells like something see how this looks
this Drive pretty much actually not that
I thought it was going to be Dooley or
anything but feel like it dried up
pretty fast like you have to blend it
immediately I'm going to add a little
bit more right here where I need more
coverage and then a little bit on my lid
I think you would like this more if you
have oily under eyes or if you have like
oily skin because this concealer might
be a little too drying for me but I
don't want to judge it right away so how
many of these I've seen riverdale please
leave me your thoughts down below I just
finished it and I liked it I really
really do I mean the main reason I even
started watching it because Cole Sprouse
plays Jughead and I love the Sprouse
twins they're been from friends hello
but I also feel like it's a little
cringy like the dialogue and the things
that they say on that show I don't know
like seriously what would you do it here
in school and I grow like Cheryl blossom
came up to you to talk to you and would
talk to you like that
nobody talks like that in high school
it's just it's funny but anyway I do
kind of like to show I like how it ended
like I didn't expect that at all like
how season 1 ended okay so for powder
I'm going to powder my under eyes I
don't know if I'm going to powder my
face I have two powders here to try out
and I don't know which one I want to use
this is the new Too Faced Born This Way
a furious setting powder I am so excited
for this one I think I want to use this
one and then I also have the tarte
filtered light setting powder I might do
one eye with this powder and one night
with this powder yeah let's do that I'm
going to take the Born This Way powder I
really love the packaging on this - yeah
like the little stopper and I'm going to
take my little bra
okay there's like little shimmers in
this not like an aggressive amount of
shimmer and they're not chunky glitters
or anything but there's this definite
chip Shiva but I don't mind that all the
time sometimes I don't like how it looks
under the eyes sometimes it's alright
I'm also going to dust some of that like
on the rest of my skin just test it out
all right so let me clean off this brush
not on my pants and try out the Tarte
filtered light setting powder on the
other side cap some of this onto the cap
set my under eye
okay so these two powders are nothing
alike
this Tarte one is actually pretty
mattifying but not in a dry way it's
going to mattify it too much it looks
very natural and actually really really
like how this powder looks to phase one
definitely has more of a sheen I don't
know if you can tell I told we can so my
suggestion is if you have normal to oily
skin you would like this one but if you
have normal to very dry skin you might
like this one alright I am going to
balance out my skin though I'm going to
add a little bit of Sheen to this side
all right so for bronzer blush and
highlight I really wanted to try out
these products I just recently purchased
them off Sephora
and they really intrigued me this
packaging is so beautiful from the brand
ciate and I have their Palm Island
bronzer to try out staying matte bronzer
and then I also got this summer love
blush and this is what it looks like it
actually swatches almost like a
highlight it's a very light shimmery
blush so I'm going to be putting a blush
underneath this first because I'm afraid
this might not work on its own and then
for highlight I got this ciate highlight
in the shade starburst which it looks
insanely shimmery I don't know how I'm
gonna feel about this but we shall see
so anyway where I was getting at with
the whole riverdale thing if you guys
know of another show on Netflix that I
just need to watch let me know I've seen
shameless I'm actually currently
watching Quantico and I really like it
like they just posted season 2 on
Netflix
honestly the main reason I'm watching is
because I love the main actress Priyanka
Chopra I believe that's how you say her
name I think she is like one of those
beautiful people ever and I watch just
for her I just feel like binging
something else on Netflix so please
leave me your thoughts below I mean
chances are I probably have already seen
it I'm going to be honest I watch a lot
of TV or Netflix but still just leave me
your thoughts or your suggestions down
below I actually found out that the
executive producer of one day at a time
if you watched our show on Netflix it's
about like a Cuban American family it is
really good I love it the executive
producer House me on Twitter
I don't worry that got me really excited
but is it I really so much to that show
and I thought it was so cool that she
follows me and he says she watches my
videos I love the cast
I love the grandma she's my favorite I
always tell my mom that when she gets to
that age she is going to be exactly like
the Oh a lot in that show my dad was
telling me that that show was on like
years ago which I didn't even know but
then they redid it and they did it was
like a Cuban family which I find that so
crazy so I think it's really amazing
that they're showing like a little piece
of Cuban culture with that show anyway I
love this brother can I just say that I
really really do I thought it was going
to be like too pinky I really like this
undertone like okay so for blush I'm
going to add this blush underneath this
one I actually haven't used this blush
it I've used other blushes in this range
but not this color this is the LA girl
just blushing blush in the shade just be
you by the way I just realized that a
lot of these like barely any of these
products are drugstore
I'm so sorry I didn't really notice that
it's just this is the newest makeup I
just recently got in my life and it just
so happens to mostly be high-end but if
you want to see a drugstore hot in the
upcoming weeks definitely let me know
and I will do that for you I love buying
drugstore makeup so let me know but this
color is so pretty it has like a satin
finish
I really really really like them at
least the ones I've tried this colors
pretty though it's like a peachy nude
okay so right on top of that I'm going
to apply summer love it's such a pretty
nut such a pretty color I love it then
I'm probably more like a blush topper I
don't even know if it claims to be a
blush okay I just looked it up and it is
a glowing illuminating blush keep mixing
okay so it is very illuminating not on a
super thick chunky gross way although
you could totally see the shimmers in
this blush 100% but sometimes I like
that look especially in the summertime I
think that looks excellent I don't know
if I love it but I think I like it so
far okay let's try this highlight I'm
really nervous about this it just looks
so shimmery it's beautiful it's
definitely not a natural highlight
though you can kind of see it sitting on
the skin you know how really metallic
highlights like this you can definitely
see it when you look up close or from
far away it looks so beautiful this
would look stunning in photos
you guys know I prefer a more natural
highlight that I could build up versus
something so shimmery but it's kind of
like it okay so to melt all those
powders down and so that everything just
sinks Ransome skin I'm going to use this
as a setting spray wish me look
I'm nervous let me put my hand like
maybe if I shoot it up actually
somewhere I look at this highlight the
more and you'll love it
I am so indecisive when I try out a
product for the very first time I have
to use something like two or three times
I feel like I can just kind of see it
sitting there okay so let's just move on
to the eyes we are officially done with
the face for the eyes I'm going to be
testing out this new Marc Jacobs palette
I just bought this and I know I'm going
to get this for PR but when I saw this
on Sephora like I just bought it I don't
know why I couldn't help myself
and if it just come to me and PR I'll
just give it to one of my friends plus I
love sharing the makeup love with my
friend so no harm no foul
I got my palette in the shade scandalous
they came out with a ton of new palette
these palettes have been around for a
long time I think the famous one is the
Lolita palette I have it and it's it's
alright it really isn't my favorite but
this one in scandalous looked so
beautiful so let's try out these bad
boys I'm going to take this shade right
here it's called that's why buy this
color directly in my crease this is
going to be my transition shade does
anybody probably there is a lot of kick
up with this but what matters is how it
applies to the eyes I can always look
past kick up if the eyeshadows are
really easy to blend oh my gosh are you
guys up to date with all the stuff I has
been what should I just got pick up in
my coffee have you guys been caught up
with all of the black China and Robert
Kardashian drama I really can't believe
that's happening honestly like you never
know what's real what's fake when it
comes to celebrities and social media
and there are three sides to every story
as you guys I'm sure
No but it's such a crazy situation if
you guys have no idea what I'm talking
about just Boogaloo I'm not really into
this celebrity drama I honestly I do not
keep up with other people's lives that
much but I'm dying to know like who you
side with in this situation because I
think both parties royally messed up
there both of them I mean I don't know I
don't know the story that seems like
such a toxic relationship and I hope
that they could settle their differences
and be civil for their daughter because
that's the most important thing but well
Fela Kim posting her naked on his
Instagram was way too far too far for me
she goes and sends him a video like her
kissing another guy like why why would
you do it what's happening
side note by the way I really love this
eyeshadow it's such a delicious warm
pigmented yummy color I'm going to take
a little bit of Little Miss this one
doesn't have as much kick up as the
brown one I'm only going to apply a
little bit of this color because I will
be going in with an all-over lid shade
and it's pretty much going to cover that
anyway like I was saying I'm not taking
China side at all I really do think he
was extremely hurt and people do really
crazy mean things sometimes when they're
hurt like they just lash out so better
both lips to be honest okay I've talked
about this topic for way too long I'm
going to take this delicious copper
shade and I'm just going to apply this
color to my entire lid I have to say I'm
pretty impressed with this eyeshadow
usually I'm not very impressed with
luxury eyeshadows I mean I have tried
out Marc Jacobs edge shows in the past
and I really do like them but I'm really
impressed with this palette so far the
pigmentation is very nice now called
pigmented that is that is really pretty
I'm going to take some more of that
crease shade we first used and I'm going
to apply this in my crease okay I'm
going to go back and intensify that red
color it's British copper shade and then
I'm going to go back into that deep
shade Little Miss and deepen up my outer
corners with that I have the Thomas
O'Malley song stuck in my head
for my lower lashline I'm going to take
that crease I used this color is so
pigmented you have to be careful I love
it though it's awesome
I'm actually going to take this
cranberry shade called scandalous and
I'm going to apply it right on top of
that Brown this palette is a lot more
pigmented than I thought it was going to
be I got to say I am really impressed I
have a Lolita and I don't remember being
blown away by Lolita but I really love
these colors for eyeliner I'm going to
take the Urban Decay 24/7 glide-on eye
pencil and alkaline never tried this
before I've just watched it I mean I've
tried these before just not this color
okay so I can totally see a lot of
people hating this eyeliner probably a
little too red for some people but I
have to say I love eyeliners like this
if you like they make eyes just really
pop and stand out so I like it okay to
finish up the lower lash line I'm going
to take that dark purple Brown and I'm
going to play this real easily close but
I'm going to keep it on the outer
corners and by the way I know I do a lot
of the same techniques every time I do
my makeup but this is what works for me
everybody's different I'm sorry I never
claimed to be a link of artists I know
some people think that I claim to be one
but I really really do not every time I
get those comments like ah you're a
terrible makeup artist I'm like
available to him because I'm not a
makeup artist that's like telling me
like oh my gosh Kevin you're a horrible
astronaut yeah probably a good thing I'm
not a natural I don't know people can be
a little bit intense FRA Bravo and I'm
going to take this satin color right
here called at the office I'm going to
use that to clean up underneath my brow
bone that actually isn't as light as I
thought it would be so that color
Islamist meeting I thought I thought it
would be highlighting but it so this use
this one if you're darker than me then
this totally would be a highlight shade
but if you're my skin tone or fair this
is not hiding
okay so for mascara actually don't have
a new mascara to try out so I'm going to
apply some trish mcevoy high volume
mascara and I will be side luck okay so
things got dark pretty fast
we will lighten up this lip in a second
but basically I put on some mascara and
I notice I didn't have any inner corner
highlight so I just took this first
shimmery shade and I use that and then
since I don't have any brand new lip
product I went ahead and applied this
and I realized that I don't think I've
ever worn this this in the shade
b-school t and is it me or does this
look hella dark on my loop so I'm going
to be taking this lipgloss I've actually
never used it before so that's good this
is the shoe a high pigment lip gloss in
the shade PCH okay guys so that
