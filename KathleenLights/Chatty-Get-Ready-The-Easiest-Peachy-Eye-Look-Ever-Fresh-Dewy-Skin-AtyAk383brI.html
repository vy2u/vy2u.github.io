hey guys so today's video is going to be
a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now it is a very simple
look but I asked you guys the other day
if you wanted to see a tutorial using
the weekend festival palette and I did a
peachy look the other day like
off-camera and it was this really
intense peach eye and I asked you guys
if you wanted to see it and a bunch of
you guys said yes so that's what I'm
doing for you guys today I really love
this look
it's very intense but it's so easy to
recreate and the skin is nice and fresh
most of the products I'm using in
today's video are affordable it's mostly
stuff you can get at the drugstore or
like online there's just a couple
high-end products in this video but I
really really love looks like this I see
myself doing this a lot this spring
maybe not the eyes but I see myself
wearing this face routine a lot this
spring and summer
this is a chatty get ready with me kind
of I'm not really chatting much so I'm
not gonna call it a chatty get ready but
it is a talk through tutorial I didn't
want to do a voiceover today for some
reason so I'm just talking to you guys
but yes if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching okay
so I'm gonna start off with my eyes and
I'm gonna be using the pea Louise makeup
base to prime the lids supposedly this
eye base works best if you don't set it
I'm not used to not setting sticky
little primers like this but I'm not
gonna set it I'm just gonna go in like
this so this look is very easy like a
lot of my looks are I'm actually gonna
be doing it more colorful a little bit
bolder looks here on my channel coming
up soon it's just with all the
pre-recording I'm doing I wanted to do
something a little bit more laid-back
for today but I've been wanting to do
like a really fun aqua eye shadow look
and like a silvery green eye shadow look
as well so I know this look is boring
better promise I'm gonna get more fun so
this look is so easy I'm just gonna take
my BH Cosmetics festival palette and I'm
gonna take
this shade candy and this is pretty much
it's gonna go on our entire lid all over
the place I'm gonna use the BH Cosmetics
number seven brush and at first I'm just
gonna tap this all over the lid and then
I'll go in and blend out the crease
after I like this eye shadow because it
kind of looks matte when you look at it
but it has such a pretty satin finish to
it kind of has like a glowy sheen this
palette is so cool it has so many
different colors and you get so many
different options I really like it now
I'm gonna take a clean fluffy brush even
though this one doesn't look clean it is
it's the more feet r38
and I'm gonna dip back into a candy and
just diffuse the harsh lines just blend
blend blend so that color just looks
nice and smooth in the crease I also
think because this palette has so many
fun colors that it would be really cool
to do kind of like a two looks using one
palette type of video like I recently
did with Dream Street I think it would
be cool to do with this festival palette
because you can get so many freaking
looks let me know if that's something
you would be interested in now I'm gonna
go back into candy and just intensify
the lid shade
okay so now with this BH Cosmetics
number five brush I'm gonna take the
shake Trixie and I'm gonna pop this
around the inner corners of the eyes but
also dragging it onto the inner part of
the lid I really want to open up that
inner corner I normally wouldn't go so
heavy with my inner corner highlight and
like bring it up so far but I think it
looks really nice with this shade and
once we like complete the look I think
that that bright inner corner just makes
everything look so youthful and fresh
I'm gonna take a little bit of this
magical shade right here it's kind of
like a dark bull it's not a dark gold
it's just a little bit deeper than
Trixie and I'm gonna pop that right here
in the inner corners just a little bit I
only want a little bit of this magical
color to shine through right there I'm
gonna take a little bit of Trixie shade
I used right in the inner corners and
pop some on the brow bone just at the
tippy-top of the brow bone right here
because this is a very very shimmery
look actually gonna
blend everything out now I'm gonna take
my finger with some more candy color and
just intensify the lids I actually do
think I really like that eyeshadow
primer without setting it I feel like
the crease blended really well
I mean shimmery shades tend to blend
easier than maths anyway and this is a
little bit of like a shimmery shade but
I think I do really like that base okay
so I'm gonna finish up the rest of my
eye and after I do my face I'm gonna
take a wipe and clean up my under-eye
fallout okay for my face I'm gonna prime
with the vanilla Parata Beauty blur skin
tone optimizer this gives your skin a
really amazing glow while adding a
little bit of color and I don't know I
just like how it makes my skin look it
almost gives it like a summer filter to
up my glow game even more I'm gonna take
a little bit of the tatcha luminous dewy
skin mist okay so for a foundation I'm
gonna be mixing my Physicians Formula
the healthy foundation I always mix
these two shades lw2 and mw2 they're
color selection sucks but I love this
foundation so much I've just come to a
conclusion I love how it looks on my
skin it gives me a nice smooth finish
and it just makes me look nice and
healthy I don't know I really like it
and I have been loved being this brush
whereas if I react I don't know if my
favorites video is going up before this
video since I pre recording but I'm
gonna be talking about it in my
favorites video so stay tuned for that
if that is already up which I think I
think it is already up by the time
you're watching this yeah it's amazing I
can't believe I like a flat brush like
this so much the Sigma flat top kabuki
brush when that was popular I didn't
really like it that much
I don't know but I love this brush so
much and I love this foundation I think
it's the perfect springtime foundation
it blends right into the skin I mean
look how fast that just went into my
skin and I think it just looks so
healthy it has the perfect name it
doesn't have the best coverage in the
world but it is super buildable for
concealer I'm gonna be using my color
pop no filter concealer they have new
shade names now but I'm gonna be mixing
light 16 and medium 20 I feel like I
can't find my perfect shape just yet in
these new colors
so I add a little bit of medium
underneath light I'm gonna be buffing
that in with my g2 brush
I really feel like this foundation and
this concealer are like a match made in
heaven I'm gonna have a little bit more
in the inner corners like cool really
close to my lower lashline just to add a
little bit more coverage there this
concealer blends right into this
foundation I mean it's a great concealer
anyway but I feel like with this
foundation
and just so that I don't look crazy I'm
gonna add some of that light shade to
the rest of my face to highlight not
only do I like adding concealer right
here to highlight the face and so that
everything looks the same but so that I
can cover up that birthmark I have right
there that drives me literally crazy
okay to set my under eye can see that
I'm gonna be using my Maybelline fit me
powder in fair light this is gonna go
directly underneath the eyes with this
wet and wild p65 brush I'm also gonna
set down all the areas where I know
really crease right here on the mouth
I'm actually gonna make a little bit
right there for those real aggressive
smile lines and then I'm just gonna wipe
it away okay so I do want to add the
glow because my face looks very matte
right now oh my gosh Jesse left her
wanky fan brush at my house okay I'm
gonna take my color pop f13 brush and
I'm gonna dip it into this essence pure
nude highlighter and this is gonna give
my face that glow that we just kind of
like took away I'm gonna put this
everywhere you can see like the glow
that that just gave my forehead
I'm so fair right now that even this
color you can like see it on my skin
like do you see I just added kind of
like a strip of color right there by
mistake I need a little bit of tan in my
life do you see that globe as it just
added I know this is not our new product
or anything but I'm obsessed okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and finish up the eyes
I'm gonna go back into the festival
palette and just intensify all the
shadows we already put down so I'm gonna
take my finger I'll play a little bit
more candy then I'm gonna take my pinky
and dip it into magical which is so
funny I just realized that's the same
name as one of the eyeshadows in my
dream Street palette right on the inner
corner and then going back into Trixie
and intensifying the inner corners with
this little wet and wild pencil brush
this eyeshadow is so freakin intense and
I didn't even what it or anything okay
so now I'm gonna line my eyes I'm gonna
use this dose of colors set the tone
cream matte eye color in the shade rodeo
it's just like a really pretty warm
brown and I'm gonna do a nice little
wing with this using the Sigma winged
liner yo6 brush guys please excuse my
lighting by the way sometimes I look for
the warm sometimes I look really cool
toned I don't know how to fix that on my
camera if you have any tips leave them
in the comments below but I'm gonna take
my mr. Bing eyeliner from colour-pop and
I'm gonna tight line with this
I'm gonna apply this to my waterline as
well I love this eyeliner and makes
green eyes look even greener for my
lower lash line I don't want to take
this peach color down there because it
is a very intense peach so I'm gonna
take a little bit of this shade hipster
and I'm gonna focus this color really
really really really close to my lash
line this is from the makeup Shack I
bought a few brushes after Jesse after I
used them in the video with Jesse
because they're so freakin good and soft
and this is the t58 so just like that I
only want a little bit of this color for
mascara I'm gonna take the Maybelline
and Gigi Hadid fiber mascara
okay so now that the eyes are done I am
gonna go ahead and finish up the face
the bronzer i'm gonna be using today is
the bronzer I called in my Sephora vib
haul this is the Guerlain terracotta
bronzer in the shade 0-1 this thing
smells so freakin strong like I hate the
scent but I really like the bronzy vibe
it gives my skin I think it's perfect
for spring and summer so I'm just gonna
take my little cosmetics wand brush and
I'm gonna bronze up the skin even though
this bronzer isn't shimmery I feel like
it gives you such a nice glow to the
skin it's not it doesn't like it's
literally matte but the undertone is so
nice I really really like this bronzer I
think it was worth the money okay I paid
a pretty penny for this guy but I really
like how it blends I like the color I
don't know if it beats out my other
bronzers we shall see I don't know if
this scent and this breaks me out yet we
shall see but I'm gonna use it quite a
few times and so far so good but you
never know
see I feel like I gave me a tan you know
it's an attempt at Jenny from the block
and I'm okay with it I think it's a very
JLo bronzer I might go a little heavy
with this guy but I want my skin to look
nice and tan since I'm so damn fair
these days for blush I have to I have to
it's a peach eyeshadow look okay this is
the bare peach blush from Burt's Bees
I'm gonna add a little bit of this to
the cheeks this is like the most
stunning peach blush ever it gives a
little bit of a sheen it's like a
barely-there sheen but it does make your
skin glow a little bit which I really
really
if you have like oily skin or large
pores and you hate shimmery blushes but
you want very very very subtle glow your
peach I'm gonna add a little bit more
something-something with the benefit
Gold Rush blush I just want to use it in
a video because it's such a pretty blush
and it gives a nice subtle golden glow
to the cheeks it's not like super golden
but it's there for highlight I'm gonna
take one of my favorite peachy
highlights it's from the gimme more on
highlighting palette from colour-pop and
it's the shade bigger and better I love
this hi loved
I'm gonna take my Ecotools controlled
setting brush because it cannot find my
color pop highlighting brush so this
will do I'm just gonna pop a little bit
of this right at the tops of the
cheekbones like right at the very top
because the face is already so glowy
with the blush I don't want to like
overdo it and look like sweaty like two
sweaty and oily so I'm just popping this
right up here because I'm about to go in
with another highlight anyway so alright
I'm gonna take the artist Couture and
Jackie ina the peach highlight really
really gorgeous and this is a bedding
t-midi highlight but a little bit of
this just makes the cheeks look so
pretty so I'm gonna take Jenna Soni to
be
so intense I'm obsessed like wow this
stuff is so gorgeous like hello I guess
I do look a little sweaty now but that's
ok this is pretty sweaty okay now melt
all that into the skin we definitely
need a setting spray especially after
all that highlighting so I'm gonna take
my morphe prep and set makeup setting
spray okay so I'm gonna go back into my
Maybelline fit me powder this powder is
a little bit more matte and I'm just
gonna go back and powder all the areas I
want to keep matte because I did use a
lot of highlight I want to make sure
this stays nice and matte though and
then that completes the face so dewy so
peachy so springy I love it for lips I'm
gonna give you three different options I
wore this look the other day and I did a
very clear glossy lip and I will show
you that one at the end but I feel like
I don't really know what I want this is
the h2o gloss from target's brand-new
it's called sandy toes let me see if
this would look good ooh that does look
really pretty oh I like this a lot
actually I really like these glasses but
let me show you what I wanted to do this
is a really good option but the color
pop looks lipstick in the shade quickie
it's the new collab with makeup Shayla I
really like this with this look
it's very monochromatic it's a lot of
peach eNOS but I really like it and then
if you wanted to throw a gloss on top to
just maybe make it less peachy this
might I lipgloss from bucks on a is
gorgeous
so we have this option as well I think I
like the other option more this is like
very peach this actually turned out to
be like the exact same color as this I
like it it's just a little bit much for
me but the other day when I wore this
look I took the flower galaxy glazed
holographic lip gloss in the shade
angelic and I just popped a little bit
of this in the center because it's very
very sticky and very very like glittery
so it only took a little bit of this or
not like a little bit of this but just
right in the center and then I went over
it with the Too Faced melted latex clear
lip gloss and I just kind of spread out
all the glitters a little bit more right
in the center
I basically just wanted my lips to look
clear and like wet when I did this day
of the day but with a little bit more
juiciness which is why I added the like
the shimmery glitter yeah I think of the
prettiest gloss is the first one I think
this looks the prettiest was a little
bit of sandy toes on the lips but I just
wanted to show you how I did the look
the other day I just went for a very
clear juicy look to the lip which i
think is really nice I used to hate just
wearing clear gloss but I've been liking
it a lot recently so yeah anyway guys
that completes this look I hope you
enjoyed this very dewy peachy vibe I
think it's perfect for springtime I will
be doing some more colorful
out-of-the-box looks here on my channel
soon I'm just waiting to be settled and
be back home and I can have all this
pre-recording behind me but anyway I
hope you enjoyed this look that
completes this video thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye well almost all
beats or mascara
