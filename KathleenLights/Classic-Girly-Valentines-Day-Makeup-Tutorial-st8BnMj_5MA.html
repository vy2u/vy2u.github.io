Valentine's Day makeup tutorial that is
focused around a bold red lip actually
give you two bold lip options a red one
and a more purpley pink option depending
on what's your style girl and by the way
this isn't going to be my only
Valentine's Day tutorial I plan on doing
two more
so my next two videos after this should
be Valentine's Day tutorials because I
wanted to do more because this one is
just so basic and simple and I want to
do more like girlier and pinkier looks
but for those of you who don't like to
wear like pink pink pink pink pink pink
this one's for you also this makeup
would be perfect for like a girls night
out if you're going out to hang out with
your girlfriend you know if you're
single and doing your thing and you
don't really have like a romantic date
to go to this would be the perfect look
because I don't know about every guy but
I feel like a lot of guys don't like
lipstick or maybe it's just it's just
mine so yeah I hope you like this look
and the lip options I will be doing two
more tutorials like I said so if you
don't like this one and you're like
that's not very Valentine's Day don't
you worry I've got two more coming your
way so now see I get this look you know
what to do
for my eye primer I'm using Mac's
painterly paint-pot
and I really like using this one because
it covers up all the veins on my eyes
and I've got a lot of those so I just
put like a nice even canvas on my lid
I'm taking my original Naked palette for
this and I'm using the color naked which
is the lightest matte shade in the
palette and on a big fluffy brush I am
just going to pack this into my crease
and I'm going to be very messy with this
I'm really just going to soar a little
round and make sure it gets pretty much
all over my crease
then with a more precise blending brush
like the Mac 217 I'm going into the
color book and I'm going to focus this
into the socket of my crease I'm not
going to be as messy like I was with the
eye shadow naked I'm just going to focus
buck right into my crease and on the
outer v of my eyes
then I'm taking my Maybelline message on
my eyeliner you guys know it's not
slightly ripped and I'm going to
tightline with this but I'm not going to
add it to my waterline then I'm going to
take my liquid liner by NYC and I'm
gonna do my winged liner I don't want to
do it too thick I want to do it pretty
thin not too thin not too thick you know
and basically I just start by stamping
it onto my lid and then start dragging
it across
I don't do the flick just yet I do that
part last but I just take my time with
it and then build up the pigmentation
that way then when I just do my lick all
I do is I draw a little line and then
connect it and fill in the triangle
then I'm just going to curl my lashes
and apply my Clinique lash doubling
mascara to my top lashes
for my waterline I am taking this chela
ivory lace highlighter and I'm going to
apply this to my waterline just to open
up my eyes a bit and give it that
classic Hollywood look and then I'm
going to take the eye shadow book on a
tiny little of eyeshadow brush and apply
that to my lower lash line I'm using the
Maybelline Baby skin instant pore eraser
and I'm just going to apply this to the
areas that I think I need it
then I'm going to take my little benefit
stay don't stray concealer slash
eyeshadow primer and I like to use this
as a primer for my comes here because I
feel like my concealer lasts longer when
I use this and it gives you just like a
hint more of coverage
for my foundation I am using my absolute
favorite foundation in the entire world
you guys have no idea this is the
Bourjois healthy mix serum I have been
loving it recently if you guys want a
foundation routine or review on it
please let me know down below because
it's seriously a godsend and I'm just
going to use the Real Techniques buffing
brush and the buff I'm gonna buff this
all over my face
for underneath my eyes I'm using my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and I'm going to put this
in like a little v-shape underneath my
eyes to highlight as well
and then of course I'm going to blend it
out with my little trusty Real
Techniques contour brush and then I'm
just going to set it with my MSF natural
that is way too dark for underneath my
eyes I need to get myself a lighter one
but it's my favorite powder in the world
so it's going to have to do to contour
my face a little bit I'm going to be
using the Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer that smells heavenly
and I am just going to start contouring
my face you guys it see me do this a
million times but that's what I'm doing
then to give my face a little bit of an
overall bronze glow I'm using this pixie
bronzer in subtly Sun touch I like it
because it has like a little bit of a
pinky tone and I'm going to use this
kind of like as a blush as well and it
has a little bit of a sheen so I'm kind
of using that as a highlight too
it's very natural
I'm also going to dust that on my neck
and a little bit on my chest to give
myself a little bit of bronze glow then
I'm going to set my makeup with the
Urban Decay chill setting spray just so
my makeup stay intact on that long from
my lips I am using Mac's
cherry lip liner to line my lips and
then I'm using Mac's Ruby root right on
the top the best red lipstick in the
history of the world
if you're not into red lipsticks I've
got another option for you that I think
would be perfect for Valentine's Day so
I'm going to line my lips with Mac's
magenta lip liner this is seriously the
most beautiful lip liner I have ever
seen in my entire life and take a
beautiful metallic e do a prone purpley
pink named Donna describe it and then on
top I'm using Revlon's lip gloss color
burst lip gloss in adorned this lip
gloss is unreal it's so pretty and so
incredibly pigmented I'm so happy I
picked it up seriously go buy it if you
like these kind of colors because it's
beautiful so that is the end of this

would use the red or the pink and thank
