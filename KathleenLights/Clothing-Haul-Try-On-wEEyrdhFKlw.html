that I have never done on my channel
before and it is a fashion haul usually
whenever I do hauls they are beauty
hauls like makeup and skincare and all
that good stuff but I've never sat here
and showed you like a fashion haul
before and honestly it's because I don't
really do much shopping for clothes and
actually it's a little bit of a problem
because I'd rather buy like a makeup
product over a piece of clothing and
recently my wardrobe just hasn't been
looking its best while I was in Miami I
was borrowing a lot of my sister's
clothes those were kind of like the same
size shoes and everything but like the
other day daddy put a stop to that he
was like seriously you need to buy
clothes you need to go to the mall and
buy clothes because you you just need
clothes which he is completely right
because I actually have a pair of jeans
that I love so much and I had them since
my freshman year of high school
that is a long time that's eight years
guys so yeah anyway recently I bought
some clothes and I wanted to sit here
and share with you guys this is also
going to be a Tryon kind of haul video
like I will put clips with me actually
wearing these pieces I feel like that's
a little bit more helpful I feel like
people like that more when they see the
clothing actually like worn today I'm
just going to go ahead and jump right
and actually want to incorporate more
fashion tech videos on my channel let me
know down below if you would like to see
more fashion related videos like more
fashion hauls or actual look books or
outfit of the days kind of thing because
my channel is kind of strictly like view
your lated but I want to branch out and
do different things the majority of the
clothes I got was from Charlotte Russe I
like Charlie Rose my favorite place to
shop is forever 21 because it's cheap
and it's cute
but the closest forever 10 I went to me
is like an hour away so the closest
thing I have is Charlotte Russe and I
really really like the Charlotte Russe
by my house I got this really really
pretty rubber this was actually
something that was on the mannequin as
soon as I walked in to Charlotte Russe
loved it these are clothes rompers right
I'm pretty sure they are it's a backless
one it's really pretty it has like this
not tribal print but it has like all
these pretty little triangles and it's
yellow orange baby blue has like a mint
and a purple it has a lot of pretty
little pastel colors and like the pop of
orange I think it's really nice for
spring and summer and it just looks
really pretty like around the neck I
don't typically like rompers all that
much because I feel like the elastic
band around my stomach looks weird but
this wouldn't seem to look okay so I
really like this so I was in desperate
need of a pair of jeans like I said I've
been wearing the same ones for a really
long time and I got these these are the
mid rise skinny jeans and I really
really love light denim I just think it
looks so pretty especially in the summer
I have a couple of dark jeans that I
wear but for the summertime I love like
denim and they're a little bit
distressed here and on the knees which
is why I really wanted it because the
distressed look is my favorite and I
just love how this look I really like
these I don't know if I said it's the
mid rise skinny so they are skinny jeans
they come to like a skinny little point
at the end and they are a little bit
long on me but I just fold the ends up
like most jeans because I'm five two and
jeans are usually well not me but yeah I
really really love this I think that
this would this looks really cute with
this top I think that this would look
good with so many different tops and
just fun for the summer a lot of people
like don't even touch their jeans in the
summer time but I love it and I'm from
Miami and I so rocked jeans in the
summertime because I write I like shorts
but I kind of feel uncomfortable wearing
shorts most of time so love these I did
get a pair of shorts though these are
high waisted so I thought they were
really really cute just like regular
black nothing too special about it but
they are high waisted and they look
really really cute I typically don't
like high waisted shorts because like
feel like it makes my stomach look a
little strange but black you know black
is slimming so I really really like
these I have a pair of black shorts that
are just great at this point so I wanted
to
so really really these they actually
right now they have like so many
high-waisted shorts and high-waisted
jeans and they have a lot of like really
nice jeans and shorts at Charlotte Russe
so I can hang on to Charlotte Russe to
go check them out if you're looking for
high-waisted shorts so oh I am just
overly obsessed with kimonos like
chiffon kimonos and like that's a new
trend that's going on like these really
pretty beautiful flowy kimonos I'm
obsessed with them so I recently picked
up two actually didn't own any before
today I just I've been loving them from
afar I guess but I finally found two
that I really really liked and trailer
Bruce is selling a bunch of kimonos if
you're wondering so this is what it
looks like it's so pretty I love black
with floral print I think it looks so
classy and beautiful and what I love
about this is of course I have to
incorporate makeup and everything I saw
this and I was like that would look so
gorgeous with like a red orange kind of
lip like a lip matching this flower
right here it would look so beautiful so
I love kimonos because you could just
throw this on and wear like jean shorts
and like a little tank top and you look
so cute and trendy and summery so I
really really love this especially like
the color and the material and the
floral print is so pretty so sorry this
will look really nice in the springtime
too
and then the other one I picked up I
thought it looked so elegant and like
romantic and it is just this one right
here it's just like plain it is that
sheer fabric which I love um chiffon
kimono and pretty sure that's the fabric
chiffon I know but it is just a
beautiful sheer like off-white lacy kind
of color and at the bottom it has these
really pretty ruffles I don't even know
it's like this little I don't even know
what you will call this but it's really
really cute as soon as I saw it I was
like oh
move IV that in my life I just thought
it's a little bit wrinkled most of this
most of these clothes are wrinkled
because they have been sitting in the
Charlotte Russe bag for like two days
before I finally got a chance to sit
down and film this so I should have
taken it out and hang and hung the
things but I didn't I was actually on
FaceTime with Shireen and I was showing
her this piece and she was like well
that's very tumblr ish and it is this is
definitely something I could picture
somebody wearing in a tumblr picture I
picked up this plane um maxi skirt it's
in this really pretty like blush dusty
rose kind of color and it is a very
plain skirt but I wanted to get it
because I am super into maxi skirts and
maxi dresses and I just really like this
one because of the material of this I
don't know if you can tell on camera but
this material I could sleep in this like
I would wrap my newborn baby in this
because while this is so comfortable
like overly comfortable like amazingly
comfortable and I just thought it was a
nice color that would go with a lot of
different things and I got this to pair
with the skirt and it's just a really
pretty crop top and it has a beautiful
like floral lace print as you can see
all swords and I personally would never
wear a crop top unless I was wearing a
high-waisted bottom like high-waisted
jeans shorts or a high-waisted skirt
that's just me
I'm not comfortable and just walking
around with a crop top and like my
stomach in the air that's just me though
so I specifically bought it for this
skirt I think it would look so pretty
together with like big gold hoops and
like my hair like flowy and like curls
and stuff I don't know I just thought it
would look like really pretty paired
together and then I bought these two
other little shirts to wear with other
maxi skirts because they are crop tops
as well I don't have anything to pair
with it yet at least not yet I have to
go find maxi skirts that will pair
nicely with these but this is just a
basic little red crop top I think this
is so cute I love basic little t-shirts
like this you just wear it with a Mac
scar like a black maxi skirt or like I
don't know a floral print maxi skirt and
it would look really really pretty so I
really love this
and then I just got the same shirt but
in black and white I love wearing black
and white shirts or black and white
clothing because they look really good
with like red lipstick or like hot pink
lipstick so I love wearing little tops
like this I think it's really cute and
these were really cheap these were on
like $8 so when it comes to shoes I'm
very very basic I have like either
sandals that are really basic or little
sneakers a little tennis shoes or my
Nike shoes and stuff like that I'm very
basic when it comes to shoes I mean nine
times out of 10 I'm wearing sandals or
flats or stuff like that because they're
just most comfortable when they look the
best with skinny jeans and even though I
am a big fan of Jessica Simpson shoes
are probably my favorite shoes to wear
and I own a few and I love Steve Maddens
and all that stuff
typically by like my little sandals at
Charlotte Russe so I picked these up
because I thought they were really cute
these were super cheap these were $5 and
these aren't the kind of shoes that
you'll expect to have for the next five
years because they do mess up easily
because they are kind of cheap but
they're really nice to just throw on
with some shorts and gold jewelry and
like a little white tank top and stuff
so I really like getting these little
basic flip-flops and I like that this
had like the gold detailing here I
thought they made them look like extra
cute these are just little basic
Charlotte Russe sandals that I picked up
and then I picked up these little gray
sneakers and Danny really liked them
they're just like basic little great
little sneakers and these were pretty
cheap too they were $12 so these are fun
to just wear like out out to the park or
something I like the color yeah and then
I bought a bunch of leggings and tank
tops because momma can't get enough of
leggings and tank tops and then I just
picked up two little accessory pieces
while I was there I picked up this
really pretty gold bracelet and I
usually don't like bracelets because
they fall off but this one you could
adjust it to make it skinnier and felt
this look really pretty like up here
around my shoulder like up here I like a
nice like it reminds me of Pocahontas
like when I see things like this arizuka
- so an unwrapped
like that's my girl so I wanted to be
Pocahontas picanha see with a drawer
piece like this and then I picked up
this really pretty like lacy headband to
we're kind of like across my forehead
kind of thing you know I'm saying like
that kind of style I don't know and I
thought it would look really pretty
since it's white and it would go with a
lot of different things so I really love
this I want to go back and get a few
more because I love that style like that
boho style and then Danny and I went to
the outlet malls really close to her
house
they have like Michael Kors and coach
and Nike and all these really expensive
brands for a lot cheaper this is the
outlet so we went to the gap and I
picked up another pair of jeans
Danny picked up some jeans as well and I
just thought these jeans were so cute
when I saw them they are I like denim
but these are darker than the ones that
showed you earlier the other ones are
like super super like white to blue but
these are a little bit darker and what I
find so pretty about this is that it has
like a stitching throughout the entire
Jean but Danny was like why did I have
polka dots I'm like those aren't polka
dots it's like a stitching I thought it
was really really pretty I thought it
gave like a nice little twist to like
basic jeans and these were so so
comfortable because these are like
jeggings says like leggings here they're
judging's and they're so comfortable you
guys have no idea so I really really
love these and they were having like a
sale on the jeans so I picked them up
and then I just picked up this basic
little t-shirt from the gap it is very
plain but I thought it was so cute
because it has like a grey like light
purple tint to it and it's really pretty
and it has like a nice material on the
back and cool right now of course
because it's been sitting a bag so sorry
about that I know that's unattractive
but I thought it was really pretty
because it has two different materials
and then on the bottom you see the
material so I thought it was cute and
it's like a basic t-shirt but it's a
really nice basic t-shirt I like it
was this really really cute boutique at
the outlet there and I would have bought
more things we were kind of in a hurry
and I love boutiques because even though
they're a little bit pricey you find the
cutest clothes of boutiques so I picked
up this
top right here and it is super neon it
almost doesn't even come out on camera
like it's so neon that it's like
throwing the camera off it is a
beautiful like hot hot hot coral and it
is so so cute it has like a really
pretty floral detailing right here all
the way down if you could tell and it
has like a lighter pink going through I
know it's really really cute and this
looks so pretty with like ripped jeans I
don't know it looks real nice okay so
while we were at the outlet we made two
very large purchases not very large but
like bigger purchases I don't really
shop at these kind of stores but we went
to coach and Michael Kors and I just
bought a pair of shoes I coach and I
know that so many people do not like
these shoes but I love them actually
have these exactions in red and I just
really really love them they are these
little like sneakers sneakers out of
knowing with Collies these are like
converse type their mind me of Commerce
but they're not converse there's just
little sneakers like this and I know
people hate them but I think they are so
cute and just with like jeans a little
t-shirt I think it gives you like a
little fancy ish kind of vibe I don't
know I like comes up regular little
sneakers I think they're really really
pretty and I have one of the brown ones
for a real long time now I don't care if
anybody thinks they're ugly I think
they're pretty so if you guys saw our
vlog on blog channel I will link our
vlog channel down below we are posting
blogs at once a week like what we do on
the weekends and stuff like that me and
Danny you if you saw that vlog you saw
that he got me at first I Michael Kors
which was really really sweet it's funny
because the story behind this first this
purse I have wanted for a really really
long time but I just never got around to
buying it I don't know why I just didn't
I just didn't want to and actually for
Christmas Danny bought me a really
really pretty Michael Kors purse but
it's white so it does get dirty fast so
I don't wear it everyday it is in my
everyday purse I only use that first for
like special occasions and stuff like
that so I don't dirty it so we were in
Michael Kors and we were looking around
and he noticed like oh that's the dream
purse
that's the first I've always wanted so
he got it for me and I told him like a
million times to put it back but he's a
nice guy and this is what it looks like
I think I'm obsessed something I love
brown leather like I love it so much and
we took advantage of it because we were
at the outlet and I know it's just so
beautiful I love it this is the kind of
first that I would have where like every
single day because it doesn't get as
dirty as my white one they're both
leather but the white young gets dirty
superfast and I actually picked up the
micropores leather cleaner and
conditioner while I was there I'm sure I
could have got something similar for
like a lot cheaper but whatever and the
lady kind of taught me how to use this
so I can clean this regularly since it
will be my everyday kind of course but I
just think it is gorgeous
like look at you guys isn't it pretty
don't you think it's pretty okay guys so
that was everything I got when I went
shopping the other day I hope you
