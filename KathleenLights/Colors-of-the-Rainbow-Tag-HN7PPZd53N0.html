this new tag going around on YouTube
called
the colors of the rainbow tag and if you
watched YouTube as much as I do you know
exactly what I'm talking about if you
hear my husband he's playing xbox like
he does every day of his life but
basically what it is is you pick out a
certain product that you love that
matches the color of the rainbow so you
go through all the colors of rainbow red
orange yellow green blue indigo violet
and you pick out products that have
those colors that you really really love
it's it's really cool so I decided to do
it because it looked like fun and I
loved watching this tag video recently
I've been watching like a million them a
million of them I love it so yeah oh and
also the person who created this tag
added two more colors to do and they
added pink and multicolored because you
know there is no pink in the rainbow but
you have to add a pink you have to and
then multicolor which is kind of fun you
have to pick a product with a bunch of
different colors in it
but anyway I'm just gonna go ahead and
get started so the first color is red
and the red item I chose is there
something in my eye is my favorite red
nail polish and it is OPI is big apple
red and I think of the perfect red nail
polish this is what I think about it
reminds me so much of max Ruby whoo
lipstick which is really weird since the
nail polish but that's my favorite red
lipstick a long time and I just like the
fact that this is a very bright classic
red I just love it and I already have no
shame wearing this all year round so the
next color is orange and this one was so
easy for me because it's amazing and it
is Mac's
Morand lipstick I've worn it in a couple
videos I think yeah I wore this in my
products I regret
video and I know it looks really really
scary in the tube when I first bought it
I was like oh I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to pull this off that much but
honestly with like a cute summer dress
and mascara and just this it's it's the
perfect orange lipstick and it's
flattering on pretty much everyone dark
skin tones fair skin tones this they all
look good with this lipstick on it's so
bright and it's so perfect for summer
this is definitely my favorite orange
lipstick of all time the next color is
yellow and I didn't want to mention this
product just because I talked about it
in my April favorites video and I didn't
want to sound like repetitive and
annoying but I'm gonna mention it anyway
because I can't help it and it's the
L'Oreal total repair 5 damage erasing
mom this is my favorite hair mask at the
moment
it's perfect like literally that's how I
described it it's perfect that smells
perfect it smells so good it smells like
I would if I can be tasted like this
like it would taste good yeah it just
makes your hair really really soft it's
like five dollars and it's a great great
hair mask and it's pretty big this will
last a long time I use it like twice a
week and I've been using it for like two
months two months two months I don't
know but that was my favorite yellow
product the product that I'm choosing
for green is the st. Ives naturally
clear green tea scrub this is old it's
been out forever the packaging is
actually white but do you hear this
cycle my husband it's crazy but the
actual stuff inside is green it's a
green tea scrub but this is my favorite
face scrub ever because it's not
abrasive and I feel like some exfoliants
that are really abrasive on my skin dry
it out so much and I
that they're like it's really finely
milled but it really really cleans it
really really really cleans your skin
and it does have salicylic acid acne
medication in it which is an amazing for
people with dry skin but I don't use it
every day and I feel like it just really
cleans my skin well it doesn't dry it
out at all so I mean this Allyson I
guess it seems to work for me so I don't
know I love the little focus if you
haven't tried this you really need to
try it because this this scrub is just
so fresh this is the best the best scrub
ever for blue I chose a piece of jewelry
that my dear dear dear dear friend Gabby
got me and it is this home I'm taking
home of the bag and it is this super
delicate little blue amazing necklace it
looks so pretty on it is the what do you
call this the hand of Fatima oh my god
I'm totally saying that wrong I bet this
is what it looks like up close see what
I mean it's like the hand man I keep
forgetting what it's called and pretty
sure it's called the kind of foggy mom
or the phaser man I can't remember right
now and I love the fact that it's so
delicate but it will stand out with
everything you wear I think it's because
of the reflex of different color blues
it like it like shines it really does it
has like a little bit of green in it
some teal and some baby blue I don't
know it's just so pretty
stands out with everything it's
literally become my favorite necklace
ever I love it I loved it so much and
Gabby was wearing it my friend Gabby was
wearing it one day I was like oh my god
I'm obsessed with your necklace and I
could
stop talking about all night and she got
it for me which was so sweet she's so
perfect and I love her the next color is
indigo and I'm pretty sure everyone had
trouble with this color like most people
I had to google it because I was like
indigo one I mean I've heard that color
before but I don't I didn't know
specifically what it was and honestly I
wasn't gonna lie and pretend all the
pets indigo yeah I'll add this I don't
really like it but I'll edit it because
it didn't ago I wasn't I just grabbed
this goes in front of me but um what I'm
gonna show you is kind of indigo kind of
yeah and it is the crest 3d white
toothpaste this is the one that's
radiant mint enamel safe whitening and
this color right here in the middle
right here that's pretty much indigo
I would say that's under go to me I've
been using this toothpaste for two years
and the reason why I'm adding this is
because um a lot of my friends and
family are always like oh my god how do
you keep your teeth so why they look so
white and honestly it's this toothpaste
I use it in conjunction with the crest
3d white mouthwash that I feel helps too
but honestly this this isn't Jen this is
amazing I did use the Crest Whitestrips
a while ago a long time ago and this is
what kept them light a lot of people
will just use the Crest Whitestrips and
not use a whitening toothpaste and then
that'll make your teeth get yellow
faster this keeps them white it keeps
them that same white that it was when
you finish using the Crest Whitestrips
this is the best the best whitening
toothpaste I've ever used
I oh my god I can't get enough of this
the next color is violet and I'm so
cheating I'm so cheating with this
because this is barely violet but I
couldn't for some reason you would think
that that would be easy because purple
who doesn't have
lavender violets purple color things I
mean I do but honestly I just I just
wanted to talk about this because it's
kind of purple I'm gonna say it is and
the reason why I'm showing this to you
on my iPad is because it's a book did I
say that it's a book and the reason why
I'm showing you the cover on my iPad is
because the book is currently with my
sister right now who's in Miami so yeah
but it is the Eau Claire okay it is
that's a picture of me and Danny I don't
know what just happened
it's the MN the French kiss book there's
purple you can see that there is clearly
purple in this cover so I'm gonna say
that this is my vine licked product
because it's purple in there you can't
deny it
um this is the old cover of the book it
used to have a girl and a boy like
sitting on a bench but I really really
love the new covers I feel like the old
ones were really really cheesy and kind
of kiddush like little kid ish I don't
know that's just me
I loved up the new covers of this book
there's three of them it's Anna and the
French kiss Lola and the boy next door
and the new one that hasn't been
released yet that's called Isla and the
happily ever after this one's my
favorite out of this one and the second
one this is amazing if you haven't if
you're looking for a really good book to
read
pick up Anna and the French kiss it's my
second favorite book of all time it's
just a really good read and you fall in
love with a 10 st. Claire which is the
main guy in this book you just you fall
in love with him like you read it and
you you want to be with him you just
want to be with him but yeah this book
is amazing I love it I so recommend
picking it up they have it on iBooks and
they have it on the Kindle app yeah so
great great great great great great
brick red brick by brick book okay so
that's kind of it for the rainbow colors
but like I said in the beginning of this
video
pink and multicolored were also added in
this
just to make it a little bit more fun so
yeah so for my pink product um I have to
go with my pink camel right here this is
Glades angel whispers I keep this on my
shelf right here always I bought it
purposely for decoration I know that
some people are like why buy candles for
decoration that's ridiculous but I just
wanted a pink candle for my little shelf
just I feel like it would it just you
know tied all these little baby colors
together that I have going on here but I
don't even I don't like this clearly
this looks like a brand new candle and
my entire room smells like this without
without burning it oh my god this smells
so good I'm usually very into like
vanilla and very very very sugary sweet
smells I love sweet smells this isn't
this isn't very sweet but it's so classy
that's how I can describe this is a very
classy you would have to smell that for
yourself because I'm terrible at sense
but my entire room smells like this I
love it it's pink it's so cute this is
definitely it has been my favorite pink
item recently I love this and lastly
it's multicolored and I'm so cheating
for this again because honestly there's
only like a tiny detail of multicolored
in this and it is the Jennifer Lopez
Miami glow
perfume as you can see I'm like
literally hanging by a thread there's
like barely anything left of this
perfume but this is multicolored and
then you take it off and it's a cute
bracelet like you it just turns into a
cute bracelet has little sandals on the
bottom and it has like these beautiful
summer colors yellow and teal and royal
blue it's just it's a really pretty
little detail to put on the bottle and
this is definitely like my summer scent
and I'm so sad that it's wasting but it
is a Mary
I wouldn't say cheap but it's not a
really expensive perfume at all I think
this I probably got it
say all this fool bottle was like $35 I
don't know compared to a lot of really
expensive perfumes this is a steal but
it literally smells like summer and I
love the fact that it's called Miami
glow I don't know I just love that it is
just so fresh and amazing I love this
perfume I don't like any of the other
JLo perfumes I'm very picky when it
comes to perfumes like afterglow is that
what it's called
I don't know glow maybe I don't know she
has a lot of things that end with glow I
think it's kind of confusing but this is
definitely out of all my JLo well out of
all the JLo perfumes is the only one I
own and this is the one that I love this
is my favorite one
it smells so good I love it okay guys so
that's it this is my colors of the
rainbow tag I didn't include a lot of
makeup and my stuff just a lipstick I
know but I just kind of wanted to show
you a variety of different things that I
really love but really quickly I just
want to say something my next video is
going to be the husband tag which is the
boyfriend tag only Danny's my husband
but it's the same thing and funny story
I had wanted him to do like the
boyfriend does my makeup tag or like the
boyfriend tag or whatever and he was
like I don't know I don't know but he
said he was willing to do it if someone
requested it like if somebody commented
saying oh you know it should do the
husband Tiger whatever and it couldn't
be any of my friends or family because
he it was like you're gonna tell them to
write that you know you're gonna tell
them to comment so it can't be anybody
that you're good friends with you can't
be anybody in your family and you can't
tell anybody to comment it and like okay
fine so I have been waiting for somebody
to comment that on my comments for so
long I was like come on come on somebody
somebody just
just say you know somebody saying and
finally Natalie if you are watching it's
Natalie muñoz I hope I'm not butchering
your last name because I'm Hispanic and
I would be disappointed myself and
pretty sure it's Natalie you know she
commented on my last video and she was
like hey by the way you should do the
husband tag and I read it and I like
scream those like ha ha fucka and now
you gotta do it so he was like damn it
but yeah that's gonna be my next video
so stay tuned for that it should be
interesting
might be an epic disaster because Danny
daddy's a little wild you know things
just blurt it out I'm reconsidering
no but seriously that'll be my next
video and yeah so I hoped you liked this
video I hope you know you try out some
of these things because they're all
really good stuff and thank you for
watching please subscribe and I'll see
you in my next video guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
