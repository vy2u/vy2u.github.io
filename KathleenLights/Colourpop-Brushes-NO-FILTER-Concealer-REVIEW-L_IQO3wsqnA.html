a really really exciting one we are
going to be talking about colourpop's
newest launches and it's not like a
typical ordinary launch it's not
something we've seen before
I was completely caught by surprise but
colour-pop has released concealers I am
so excited for these they're called the
no filter concealers and that's not all
they also released brushes face brushes
and eye brushes oh my gosh I've actually
been waiting for them to release brushes
for a very long time it's something I've
always thought in the back of my head
like why hasn't kind of pop release
brushes and they finally have I'm so
excited for them we are going to be
talking about the concealers and the
brushes in today's video I'm going to
give you my first impressions my
thoughts my review okay they just did my
makeup with all of these brushes and I
also use two of the concealers and I
have my thoughts I have my opinions and
you guys know I always have to try out
something like a hundred times
before I can give you my true review but
I think I'm pretty sure I know how I
feel about these okay so let's talk
about the brushes first they're
releasing 12 new brushes mine are dirty
because I just use them and these
launched tomorrow if you're watching
this the day that I upload it they
launch the 27th of July and they're all
completely synthetic which I figured
colour-pop with kamala synthetic brushes
because synthetic brushes are easier to
use with their super sock super sock
super shock shadows they pick up the
pigment a lot better synthetic brushes
just work way better with their super
shark formula but they also work really
well with their powder formulas too and
let's talk about the twelve brushes they
really obviously I think they're going
to be releasing a bunch of brushes cut
about love launching things like every
two minutes I have a feeling we're going
to see a lot of brushes in the near
future I did so myself doing my makeup
right now so you can see these products
in action so if you see everything out
of order in the demo like in terms of
how I'm doing my makeup but I'm just
going to go down the list and talk about
each brush so before we get started I
want to talk about the packaging the
brushes are very pretty they're all
white they say color top right here and
they feel very sturdy I will say though
they do come in a brush roll I think if
you were to buy the entire brush kit it
would obviously come in this little
brush roll I'm sure you've seen it on
the internet already
it's a really cute brush roll but I will
say I just wanna throw it out there that
this smells terrible just smells like
plastic like intense plastic that scent
was on my brushes when I opened it and I
really didn't like how it smelled so I
washed all my brushes before I wanted to
film this video and the scent is
completely gone on the brushes they do
not smell bad they smell wonderful like
my brush cleaner I just wanted to
mention that little sensing just in case
you guys are weird like me about sense
okay first up we have the large powder
brush and this is the most expensive one
out of all of them and it is $11 I
really like this brush I use it in
different ways today I set my entire
face using my Kat Von D powder and I do
like it it's a little bit more dense
than I would like in a powder brush when
I sent my face I like using a big fluffy
brush this is a little bit too dense for
me when it comes to powdering my face
but if you're someone who prefers a
dense brush to get more coverage out of
your powder you would really really like
this brush but I also use this to bronze
my skin I had contoured before and then
I went in with my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer and I bronze my face with
it and I loved this brush for bronzer
and I even used it for blush because I
use their blush brush for something else
I just dipped it into the blush in my
color pop double-play power duo and I
use that to blush up my face and I
really liked it I was afraid it was
going to apply too much blush because it
is a little dense but it worked out and
I really do like this brush next up we
have the blush brush now one thing I
didn't mentioned earlier I do not like
the fact that color pop does not have
the names of the brushes on the actual
brush there's no number nothing which
isn't a big deal for the average
consumer and customer obviously but
since I do YouTube videos and since I
always like to write the name of the
brush in my tutorials I wish the name
was written on the brush that is
definitely one thing I don't like but
it's something I can look past and I
really like this blush brush but not for
blush I for me it's a little bit too
small for blush but if you do like a
very precise blush application this is
perfect because you could just dip it
into the blush and just put it right
here and it's like boom right there on
your cheeks but I use the today to
contour my face and I love it because of
its delicious little shape like I don't
know if you can tell it is a little
of a paddle but it is tapered so if it's
perfectly right here in the hollows of
the cheeks and I use it today with my
Kevin of Kwan sculpting powder and I
just love how it contour my face and
next up we have an angle to face brush
if you're someone who watches my channel
often you know I don't really use
brushes like this
I know people swear by them but for me I
just I never really use them but today I
used it to set my under eye concealer
and because of the shape of this brush
it got right up underneath my eyes and
it was perfect to set my concealer with
so I gotta say I like it for that I
really do here we have the stippling
brush and it's actually very similar to
the makeup geek stippling brush it's a
little bit longer
I believe these brushes are perfect for
cream contouring or liquid contour
because it really does just sculpt the
face perfectly and then you're able to
like stipple it away and blend it so I
really do like these types of brushes
for cream contouring but today I wanted
to try it to blend out my under-eye
concealer and I have to be honest I
really like how it blended my concealer
I went a little crazy and I applied way
too much concealer when I shouldn't have
because I had never even dried this
concealer before what is it an amazing
job of blending everything out it didn't
leave my concealer cakey or streaky
looking I really liked it for blending
out concealer so this one pleasantly
surprised maybe haven't had a feeling I
wasn't going to like it but turns out I
do and here we have the fan brush this
is the only brush in the whole
collection that I I really don't like
and I don't see myself using and that's
no offence the color pop I think color
pop appreciates that I'm very honest
with my subscribers no matter what and
colour-pop is one of my favorite brands
of all time like a vault you guys know
this obviously but I'm not a huge fan of
fan brushes nope one in stamping but I
wish they would have come out with one
just a little bit thicker than this a
little bit more dense because when I was
applying my highlight with this I
noticed that it was just applying a very
thin line of highlight which is perfect
for those of you who like a very very
natural highlight and even though I do
love the natural highlight I just don't
like how thin it is and I don't like how
like how thin it applied my highlight
this one is not my favorite but I know a
ton of people who love highlighting with
fan brushes so this one might be for you
and this one is eight dollars now this
guy
this guy this is the small fluff brush
finger five cents s small fluffy fur
shop thank you
Smok law for small / small fluffy brush
woof woof woof woof this is like my new
favorite highlighting brush it applies
highlight so intensely it really does
pack a punch like whoa this applies a
lot of highlight but in such a beautiful
way like it really makes your cheeks
glow like any highlight you use with
this will make your cheeks glow I really
really like this brush I thought it was
going to be too stiff for me and like a
little bit too small for highlighting
but no no I love it it is amazing and
this one is seven dollars okay so now we
can move on to the eye brushes there was
a little bit of a boo-boo with my PR
package and they accidentally sent me to
medium eyeshadow brushes and they
accidentally didn't include the blending
brush I believe which I'm assuming based
on the pictures I've seen is kind of
like a Mac 217 but let's try to look
past that and you might as well just get
started talking about the medium
eyeshadow brush I love brushes like this
a lot of brands do them but they're
really really great to pack on eyeshadow
and get as much pigment as possible
because it is so dense and so tightly
packed and because it's synthetic it's
perfect for all over the shades like
those beautiful shimmery shades or even
that shades today I used it to apply a
matte shade on my entire lid I also use
this to highlight underneath my brow
bone as well and of course it applies
products perfectly and this one is $6
this one is the tapered blending brush
it's perfect to apply colors in your
crease whenever I want to focus a color
right into the crease and not have it
too blown out or - all over the place
this one is perfect for that for that
precise crease application love it and
this one is also $6 this one is the
small eyes shader brush which is just a
tinier version of the medium light
shader brush and I love this brush so
much these are my favorite brushes to
apply my inner corner highlight because
like I said about the larger version of
this brush it applies a shadow
beautifully like so intensely if you
have an eyeshadow that you love using on
your inner corners try applying it with
this brush and you will see how dramatic
it will make your inner corners look
this one is also
really really great one I love this one
a lot and it is also six dollars then we
have the pencil brush and when I first
got this in the mail I was like ooh
I might not like this kind of a bush
because it was just a little bit too fat
for me like it doesn't really look like
a pencil brush it's a little chunky but
because it comes to such a nice point
the very tip of the brush gets most of
the eyeshadow and you do get a very
pigmented application underneath the
eyes but because it is fat it is so easy
to blend out I really like the shape of
this I like that it's a little chubby
then the point makes it perfect for
precise application I don't know I think
it's a really great pencil brush and I
didn't think I was going to like it as
much as I did
and that this one is also $6 and then
this one is the angles I brush it's just
your typical angled eyeshadow brush I
mean I have a thousand of these in my
collection nothing special nothing not
special I do think it's been enough I'm
glad they made it priests in some of
these angled brushes are a little too
thick today I used it to wing out some
eyeshadow I didn't use it with an
eyeliner I still like the effect that
gave my eyes and this one is five
dollars okay guys so those are all the
brushes I received and I can't wait to
see other brushes colour-pop will come
out with in the future
but now let's move on to concealer they
have launched concealers and they're
called the no filter concealers they
came out with 15 shades these also
launched on Thursday the 27th and they
claimed to be full coverage yet
blendable long wearing and crease proof
I mean they sound like miracles in a
little tube but there are 15 shades and
I do like the range so far I'm assuming
they might come out with more concealers
in the future I mean it's kind of tough
you never know I'm hoping to come out
with a few deeper shades like for very
very deep skin tones but I do like how
they have different undertones today on
my face I actually actually use this as
foundation I use the shade medium 30x my
foundation today I just wanted to see
how it would look as a foundation okay
so that's what I did and then the
perfect shade for me underneath my eyes
like my perfect concealer shade is
called light neutral one major con to
this concealer and I noticed right away
as soon as I was walking them on my arms
they get not like a lot darker but they
do get darker once you apply it to your
skin and you go to blend it out you can
kind of notice
immediately that its oxidizing like it
happens right away so that's kind of a
good thing it doesn't happen throughout
the date and then once it oxidizes it
doesn't really I don't notice it getting
any darker but when I was applying
medium 30 on my face like I was putting
it all over my face and blending it out
with a beauty sponge I noticed as I was
blending it how it was oxidizing and it
was kind of freaking me out because it
was a little bit darker than my neck so
just keep that in mind that these do
oxidized you might want to get two
colors just in case but besides con
I love these concealers it is full
coverage I think I applied a little bit
too much I'm not going to lie I could
have used a lot less I could have used a
lot less it is full coverage so less is
more with this one
but even though I applied a little bit
too much I found it really easy to blend
out and I like the look it gave it did
crease a bit but that could be because I
applied a little bit too much and it
gives you a beautiful matte finish that
doesn't look too cakey it's not too
matte like chalky matte it's a very
natural matte I really liked this
concealer and the best part is the best
part is these are only six dollars guys
such an affordable concealer I will say
these concealers don't have a ton of
product in them I was comparing them to
other affordable concealers like my wet
and wild one my coqui one Milani and
L'Oreal the color pop concealers come
with 0.14 ounces and this Wet n Wild one
has 0.29 ounces this coqui one has 0.21
delaurio infallible pro glow has 0.21 as
well and this Milani one has 0.24 so
even though this has less than your
average affordable concealer I mean it's
still an affordable concealer and I do
like the formula you'll just go through
this a little bit quicker than you would
this L'Oreal infallible one but I mean
it's color pop so yeah I mean I guess
that's all I have to say today I can't
wait to play around with these products
even more especially these concealers I
would love to know your opinion on these
products if you do check them out if you
do buy any of them but so far so good
like I said there were a few cons but
there were a lot of pros I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I hope it was helpful
in some way maybe you were looking into
purchasing these and I hope to make your
decision yeah guys that
