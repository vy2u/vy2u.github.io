hey guys so I'm filming this review
portion on a different day I am so sorry
that this video is up so late I expected
to post this video a long time ago but
if you follow me on Twitter you would
have known that while everybody got
these um liquid lipsticks in the mail I
was waiting for mine in the mail mine
actually got lost in the mail so I was
just patiently waiting for them to
arrive and they finally did so I was
able to film this video and put it up
for you guys I'm not wearing makeup by
the way just my eyebrows but I didn't
feel like putting makeup on anyway I
wanted to quickly come on here and give
you guys my full and 100% honest review
on this product there has been a lot of
like back and forth like controversy
about these liquid lipsticks so I am
here to talk about them I'm going to try
to make this as short as possible I'm
just going to go right to that I'm just
going to go right to it you are either
gonna like these or you're not going to
like these at all I'm just going to be
100% honest with you guys I personally
like them but that's just me just going
to grab this random one that's sitting
here so this is what the packaging looks
like very very very similar to the
anastacio like with lipsticks they
pretty much have like the same amount as
those it's just a typical liquid
lipstick packaging they retail for $6
which I don't know any other liquid
lipstick that is that cheap aside from
the LA girl matte I believe the LA girl
ones are called their matte lip glosses
but they are liquid lipsticks and those
are around $4 I think they're even
cheaper than this so anyway they are
super super affordable I'm going to go
into the pros really quick they're
affordable they're $6 totally totally
unexpected they are not tacky what so
ever which kind of works both ways some
do I don't like that but they are the
kind of liquid lipsticks that when you
do this
no it doesn't transfer like some of this
won't get stuck on the top which I find
that that sometimes happens with my Kat
Von D ones sometimes certain colors they
don't transfer because it's not tacky it
almost dries instantly but you could
still build up the color like you can do
layers and layers and layers I don't
find a problem with that but when they
dry they dry like they dry they're so
mad so there's there's no tackiness you
don't get that weird thing that you do
get with the LA girl the LA girl ones
they're great but they're tacky
anyways so yes they are not tacky they
don't transfer they're not patchy those
are things I really like cons people are
not going to like this if they hate
drawing formulas these are very drying
they're liquid lipsticks they are the
okay the formula that is closest to this
are the Lime Crime Velveteen the line
creme ones are liquid when you apply
them like you apply them to your lips
and it's pure liquid and then they dry
to a matte formula the ones like the
Stila dose of colors on a sauce yep
they're like a mousse eformula like you
could watch them on your mouth and on
your hand and you see that it's a mousse
texture takes a little bit longer to dry
but they are pretty freakin drying I'm
not gonna lie
honestly I'm the type of person me and
my friend Gabby always laugh about this
I can wear Mac Ruby woo which for some
reason it's like the driest mac lipstick
I don't know why but I could wear Mac
Ruby woo for like the entire day and I
don't feel it I love it it's like my
favorite MAC lipstick I don't feel it on
my face and my friend Gaby is like how
do you wear this this is cement on my
mouth like she cannot do it I get
literally were cement and I'll be fine
with it as long as it doesn't crumble I
can wear the driest lipstick in the
world just because I don't care how it
feels as long as it lasts all day like
that's my thing
but anyway these are super drying if you
don't like drying liquid lipsticks
you're not going to like these but for
example the Anastasio ones are not
drying last they kind of smear on me
that's okay some of them last
some of them smear on me these don't
smear because they're super freakin
matte so I mean you have to take it with
a grain of salt
they're $6
so some of them you have to work with
the lighter shades like for example this
one I'm not going to like I hate this
color this is called vice this one's
called vice this is don't buy it
this is terrible but then you have a
color like this house that I'm trying to
find it this one's my favorite
this one's called tool super smooth and
it felt almost more hydrating than the
other ones so weird um so you have to
take these with a grain of salt I say
buy to buy one or two and then try them
out and then go from there
my favorite liquid lipstick formula is
the girl lactic ones and the dose of
color ones but that's now for yourself I
have found that the best way to use this
like when I first tried it out I'm like
okay these are pretty drying I got to
work with it
I personally 100% recommend using a lip
balm underneath this these are a little
bit high-maintenance I recommend using a
lip balm underneath or a lip primer I
really love the cargo lip primer I've
been using it underneath these like the
past two days and I like the cargo lip
primer
I also recommend if you don't have that
use lip liner like use a lip liner on
your entire lips and fill in your lips
and then go with this on top and it
makes it less drying and it doesn't go
into your lines as much as this by
itself because this can kind of
accentuate your lines so using a lip
liner on your entire mouth will diminish
that so a lot I know you're like while
those are really high maintenance you
have to use a lip balm a frickin lip
primer lip liner I mean yeah but there's
six books you can make it work so yeah
those are that is my honest honest 100%
review it's not my ultimate favorite
formula but I don't think it's absolute
shipped you know I think it's pretty
decent especially for the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
