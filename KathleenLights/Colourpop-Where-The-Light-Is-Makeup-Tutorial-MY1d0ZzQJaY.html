a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now it is using the eye
shadows in my where the light is quad
the only color I did not use is
kathleenlights I wanted to do something
like bronzy and green so I did use other
eye shadows as well I didn't only use
this but I wanted to incorporate this in
today's tutorial because I haven't done
a story using blaze and blaze is an
amazing eye shadow so yeah this is a
full face makeup tutorial so if you want
to see how to get this look then just
keep watching so I'm gonna start off
with my face which is really rare but I
decided to go ahead and do all of my
face makeup before my eye makeup for
this video I just kind of primed my skin
with that Urban Decay v6 spray and then
I went in with the NYX angel veil primer
the foundation I am wearing in this
video is the healthy skin by Neutrogena
and I'm applying this with a makeup geek
flat top brush I really really love this
foundation and I don't wear it enough I
don't know why because it's so like
healthy-looking
like the name suggests it's really
really beautiful I'm mixing two products
for my under eyes today this is the
Maybelline master conceal and I forgot
how good this was this is one of the
best drugstore foundation nope drugstore
concealers and I'm in love with it it's
amazing I'm just blending that in with a
real techniques contour brush and then
I'm going to take the Mac prep and prime
little pen in the shade light boost and
I'm gonna highlight with this product
I just went ahead and blended it in with
the same brush so I decided to do
something different I am setting my
under eye concealer using the wet and
wild color icon highlight in reserved
York Rebecca been reserved your Cabana
it's a very subtle highlight so I used
it underneath my eyes to really really
really bright in that area for bronzer
I'm using the real techniques multitask
brush and dipping it into the Too Faced
chocolate Soleil and I tasted it a
little bit when I was applying it as you
saw this is the milk chocolate Soleil
not the original this one is much
lighter I love this one for my skin when
I'm a little bit more fair then I
decided to add just a little bit of
pinky warmth Venus with the bombs bomb
desert I only applied very little bit to
my cheeks to highlight my face I am
using the elf Sunkist bronzer in the
shade of Sunkist it's not a bronzer but
it is a very very golden highlight it's
a very strong gold but it's such a
beautiful highlight and it is two bucks
at your local Target or wherever they
sell elf I love this highlight it is so
golden I love it so now I'm going to go
ahead and do my eye makeup I am taking
the color pop eyeshadow in the shade
I'm applying that underneath my brow
bone yes and to my inner corners then
I'm gonna take this shade right here
called Cornelius and I'm applying this
into my crease with a Kat Von D brush
I'm only applying very little for now
and then I'm gonna take this josie maran
watercolor eyeshadow it's the beautiful
gold one I'll have the list of every
like everything down below this is that
green one that I say gold this is the
green one okay yes and I just mix that
in with my finger and then I took
colourpop's eyeshadow in the shade
and I applied it right on top with my
finger this eyeshadow is definitely
blessed best applied with your finger so
I just patted that in then I'm taking a
Bobbi Brown's single eyeshadow in the
shade camel it's such a deliciously
beautiful like yellow
yellow brown and I'm applying this into
my crease with a little fluffy crease
brush then I'm going to take a dark
brown eyeshadow this one's just from
jouer but you can use any dark eyeshadow
you want and I am just putting this into
my crease so that everything blends
nicely and there are no harsh lines I'm
going back into Blaze and just applying
another layer to my lid just in case any
of it was blended away I want to add
just a little bit of golden 'us to my
inner corners so I'm just applying that
elf highlight right on top of the Glo
eyeshadow then I'm going to take the
color pop Cornelius shade again and on a
pencil brush I'm just applying this
underneath my eyes then going in with
this NYX eye shadow it's one of their
prismatic eyeshadows this is like the
emerald green one and I just love the
contrast of the bronze on the lid and
the emerald green on the lower lash line
I think it looks really pretty so I just
smoked that out with that eye shadow and
then I applied my mascara so to finish
off this look I'm going to do my lips
this is the Charlotte Tilbury
pillow-talk lip liner and then I'm going
to apply the color pop lippy stick in
the shade Polliwog right on top okay
