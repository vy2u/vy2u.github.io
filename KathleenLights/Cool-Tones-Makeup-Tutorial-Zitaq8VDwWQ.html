tutorial on this look right here I love
these kind of looks where it's like gray
eyes and gray lips I know that's like a
very big trend I wanted to do a makeup
tutorial surrounding the Anastasio
liquid lipstick in sepia it looks so
much darker on me than it doesn't
everyone else I feel but it's okay I
like it and I used mostly the Kat Von D
shade and light palette I really love
these type of looks where you match like
eyes and lips together especially these
grey tones and it's kind of weird for me
to do this because I don't have mascara
on my lower lash line
I always smoke out my lower lashes and
put on mascara and I didn't do that for
today's video I wanted to switch it up
and I I don't know no no no no anyway if
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep on watching so the first
thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids as
usual this is Mac's painterly paint-pot
and I'm buffing that out with a zoeva
concealer brush now I'm going to go into
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
and I'm taking this whitish kind of
color I don't have the palette with me
because it's in storage at the moment
but I'm just gonna walk you through the
colors this is like a whitish shade and
I just set that base down this is a Luxy
crease brush and I'm applying that
really really really light bone beige
like grayish color and I'm applying this
into my crease as my transition shade
now I'm taking Max copperplate eyes
shadow it's just a neutral grey and this
is a morphe brush and I'm just applying
this on the outer corners of my eye
really close to that tape and slightly
bringing it in like slowly bringing in
it now I'm going to take this dark grey
in the palette with that same brush and
I'm just going to do the exact same
thing I'm just taking a bunch of grade
tone eyeshadows and creating like a
gradient effect from the tape going up
to my inner corners so that's what I'm
doing again same thing you know packing
it on the outer corners and bringing it
in slowly now I'm going in to the black
of the palette and on a different more
dense precise brush I am packing this
really really really close to the tape I
want the black to just be folk
on the very outer like corners like the
cat eye shape that effect so I'm packing
that black um really close to the tape
as I just said then I'm going to take
that same color I use first and I'm just
applying this to my inner corners so
that it could just look a little bit
brighter on my lid and then I'm applying
that to my brow bone and in my tear duct
as well just to highlight those parts in
my eyes I have a cold by the way if you
can tell I use that NYX eye liner or use
in like every tutorial it's my favorite
it's on the drugstore and I tight line
and wah and added that to my waterline
and then I just use my makeup forever
graphic liner to create a very very
small wing to prime my face I used the
Becca backlight primer and then for
foundation I am using the Urban Decay
Naked skin foundation and I'm using it
on a cover FX custom foundation brush so
I'm just buffing 9 this brush is really
really cool it's so incredibly dense so
it gives you really good coverage like
it doesn't drink up barely any of the
foundation it's pretty cool I really
like it so I'm just buffing that in to
my face so I'm adding concealer
underneath my eyes now and this is the
maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser and then this is in the
shade fair I believe and I'm just
applying that underneath my eyes and
then blending that in but you've seen me
blend this about a million times so
let's just skip over them to set my
concealer I'm using the laura mercier
translucent setting powder and this is a
real techniques setting brush
and then I just plopped on some mascara
I left my lower lashes bare that might
seem really weird for some people but I
thought it was cool and different so I
applied my Too Faced better than sex
mascara and now I'm going to contour
very very slightly and very naturally
with the a cosmetics contour kit and I
use that shade in the middle and I'm
just slightly contouring with this I
don't want anything too heavy for blush
I'm using one of my favorite blushes
during this time like this time of year
and it's Tarte expose blush and I'm
using this on a blush brush from morphe
from their gunmetal collection now to
highlight I'm using the Ofra shimmering
strips in the shade illuminating and I'm
using that very very top strip to
highlight my face oh excuse me my phone
hello texting to highlight my face and
I'm using this on an M 501 brush by
Morphy
and then to finish off my look I'm using
it the anastacio liquid lipstick in the
sepia that completes this look thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
