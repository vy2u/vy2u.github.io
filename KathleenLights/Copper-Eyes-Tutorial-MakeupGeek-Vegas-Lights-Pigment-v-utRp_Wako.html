tutorial on the look I am wearing right
now it is very very glamorous it's
nighttime appropriate I don't exactly
know what I'm going to call this look
but I wanted to do a nighttime look and
incorporate like summery colors in it as
well so this is what I came up with it's
very night time appropriate but it's
also very summery and warm and I love
how it looks you could totally wear this
look during the daytime if you want to
just don't add false lashes just put
regular mascara and you're good to go
but these false lashes make it look very
very like glamorous and the night time
it's like almost too much for me because
I'm not used to lashes and these are
very very long these are really long
lashes but I absolutely love how it
looks and it's nice to get on my comfort
zone in terms of falsies every once in a
while so yeah these are my favorite
colors to wear on my eyes I am using
makeup geeks Vegas lights pigment all
over my lid and it is amazing it is one
of the prettiest pigments I've ever seen
and it is super affordable and I have my
baby amber lights underneath I just
think it looks really really nice and
very summery so if you want to see how
to get this look then just keep on
watching okay so I'm going to start by
priming my eyes I'm using Mac's
painterly Paint Pots not only to prime
but to cover up those horrid veins on my
eyes
I'm going to apply this to my entire eye
and underneath my brow bone as well next
I'm taking a fluffy blending brush and
Mac's soft brown eyeshadow and I'm going
to apply this in my crease just a little
bit just so that the pigment that I'm
going to place on my lid transitions
nicely and it's going to be our
transition shade next I'm going to take
the star of the show and it is makeup
geeks Vegas lights pigment and is a
beautiful coppery color it's amazing and
because this pigment has a lot of
glitter I am going to spray my brush
with mac fix+
you can use eye drops if you don't have
fix+ but this is the kind of pigment
that really needs something like fix+
because if I were to apply it without it
it would just be like a bunch of little
sparkles all over my eye and the fix+
really intensifies it and just makes it
so much prettier so I'm going to apply
this to my entire lid right up to my
crease
next on my Mac 217 I'm going to go into
the color saddle by Mac this is just
like a medium brown with a lot of like
red to it it's a very warm brown and I
am just going to start blending out this
pigment little by little this part is
pretty tedious I go back into the saddle
color over and over again and just
slowly but surely you start to blend the
saddle color into my crease and blend
away any harsh lines that the pigment
made so like I said it's a little
tedious just go back and forth and
slowly bring that color up
then I'm going to go back into my fluffy
blending brush and blend out the harsh
edges then back into the 217 with some
more saddle and just slowly diffuse this
color and start bringing it up and blow
it out into the crease and again some
more back and forth
now I'm just going to take a makeup wipe
and clean any of the fallout and then
add a sharp cat eye to my eye shadow so
once I do that and get it nice and sharp
as you see here it looks nice and sharp
I'm just going to go back into the color
soft brown by Mac and add some to my
crease I'm going to take this eye Kohl
from Mac and think it's called closer
reach close to Richie close to riche not
exactly sure but it is a nice warm brown
has like red undertones to it and it's
really beautiful I have repurchased this
numerous times I love it
and I'm just adding that to my waterline
and my tight line and then I'm going to
go ahead and prime my face with Too
Faced prime and poreless primer and then
the foundation I'm going to be using is
my L'Oreal True Match and n3 natural
buff and I am using this with my Real
Techniques sponge I've actually been
using this a lot more than my Beauty
Blender I've kind of neglected my blue
my Beauty Blender a little bit so this
sponge is just so amazing you can get it
at the real on the Real Techniques
website or at Ulta calm I recommend it
it's very inexpensive and just as good
as the Beauty Blender it does soak up a
little bit more products than the Beauty
Blender does in my opinion but it's
really good
you
next I'm going to add my concealer I'm
using my booboo cover-up concealer and
just applying it underneath my eyes to
cover my dark circles and to highlight
my face as well you guys have seen me do
this part a million times but I'm just
blending it out with my finger and then
I'm going to blend it out some more with
my ELF pointed foundation brush and I'm
going to do that to both eyes of course
to set my under eye concealer to prevent
it from creasing I am using Mac's
emphasize powder and just dabbing that
underneath my eyes I have to set my
under eye concealer because I'm not it
will crease on me so this just prevents
creasing now I'm moving back on to my
eyes I'm using the bombs
Schwing eyeliner this is a great
high-end
liquid liner it's probably my favorite
one it dries matte and it's super easy
to use I'm just going to add a thin line
I'm not going to wing it out or anything
just a really thin line I'm going to
take my Clinique lash doubling mascara
and I'm going to apply a very thin coat
of this to my lashes because I will be
going in with falsies and the falsies I
will be using are the red cherry 217 and
I'm not used to applying them on camera
yet so forgive me I have to apply them
off camera because it takes forever but
then I'm going to move on to underneath
my lash line and I'm using Mac's amber
lights this is my all-time favorite eye
shadow you guys know this it's so
beautiful and I'm just going to apply a
generous amount underneath my lashes I'm
being very sloppy with this because I
want it to be like everywhere underneath
my lashes
then I'm going to clean my pencil brush
and apply Mac's nylon to the very inner
part of my eye like the tear duct area
just to highlight and I love this eye
shadow for the inner tear duct it's
beautiful then for underneath my brow
bone since there's so much shimmer going
on I'm just going to take a matte cream
color and apply this underneath my brow
bone here I'm using the cream shade in
my lorac Pro palette just any matte
color will be fine and then I'm going to
apply a thin coat of the clinic's
mascara to my bottom lashes I'm going to
add some bronzer to my face and I'm
using the NARS Laguna bronzer this is
such a beautiful summer bronzer because
it has a little bit of sparkle in it but
it doesn't really come off when you put
it on your face it's just very warm and
beautiful so I'm going to contour my
face with this I am using the tapered
highlighting brush from Sigma and I'm
just going to apply this around my
forehead and you know other places where
you'd normally contour
then I might add some blush I am using
Milani Luminoso blush it's a beautiful
like warm peach but I'm only adding just
a light wash of this to my cheeks
nothing too crazy and then for my lips
I'm using Revlon's smoked peach lipstick
and I'm just going to dab this on a
little bit I don't want too much pigment
to come off and then I'm going to top it
off with NYX and butter gloss in fortune
cookie I have been using this non-stop
you guys know I've been using it like
crazy so I'm just going to add that
right on top
okay so that completes this nice copper
summer nights makeup look I really hope
