tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's very bold perfect for the
holidays
it's not like your traditional typical
holiday makeup but I really love how
this look turned out and this video is
really really exciting because it is a
collab with my friend raw Beauty Christy
here on YouTube I'm gonna link her
channel down below I'm also gonna link
her video down below of course we
thought it would be fun to collab in a
video together over here both using the
dream street palette her look has a lot
of the Blues involved very colorful so I
wanted to do something a little bit more
warm and more in like the natural color
category so the looks could be
completely different
I haven't seen her look yet I haven't
seen it yet but I know it's gonna be
amazing because she is so talented she's
one of my favorite youtubers to watch
because of her talent she's really great
at makeup and she creates the most
beautiful looks all the time I highly
recommend you checking her out and not
only is she talented but she's awesome
her videos are super informative she
teaches you things she makes you laugh
she has a great personality definitely
check her out you guys will not regret
it you will love her she's just awesome
I cannot say enough good things about
her really humble and super genuine so
definitely check her out and I know this
is such an old-school collab I feel like
people don't collab like this anymore
these days
a real collab is when you actually
collab with somebody like in person but
I don't live in her state if I did we
would totally cut up in person so we're
both doing makeup tutorials and I hope
you enjoy both of them if this lip is a
little bit too bold for you you can
totally switch it out pop on a nude lip
and this look becomes a lot more
wearable but I wanted something a little
bit more bold and fun for the holidays
so that's what I did but anyway you know
friendly if you want to see how to get
look then just keep watching okay so my
eyes are already primed like huge and
the first color I'm going in with is
magical I'm going to take this color on
a big fluffy crease brush and then
pretty much just gonna apply this
everywhere this is gonna be like my base
color where everything is going to just
blend on top so I'm just buffing this
all over my crease on my lid as well
just all over the place now I'm going in
through the shade potion and this one is
gonna be like the main color we're
putting down I'm applying this on the
outer corners of my eyes and I'm also
dragging this color into my crease while
I'm building up the pigmentation little
by little going back into magical I'm
just blending out any harsh lines I go
back and forth with these two shades
like two more times just so that
everything is nice and blended
so going back into potion I'm just
building up that color and yeah it's a
lot of blending as usual
I'm gonna deepen up with the outer
corners just a little bit so I'm gonna
apply some of that elfish color right at
the outer corners going back into
magical I'm just gonna blend out those
edges again I'm really good at
explaining my makeup looks obviously so
now I'm taking the violet boss glittery
glue glitter glue this is a good thing
to use if you don't like to wet your
eyeshadows I know some people don't like
to do that so I applied a little bit on
the inner corners and then I applied
star dust right on top and this really
makes your eyeshadow pop obviously it's
like fur glitters and stuff but I didn't
apply it to my entire lid because you
saw it kind of took off the eyeshadow
underneath so I only applied it in the
inner corners just to make Stardust
really pop and then I wanted to add just
a little bit more of that chocolatey
brown color on the outer corners so
that's what I did and I really wanted
the look to just have like a little bit
more warmth so I took the shade spark
and I'm applying this ever so slightly
in my crease this color is very very
pigmented and you can make your look
look really pink really fast so I
applied just a little bit of this in the
crease and I feel like it makes such a
difference but in such a pretty way it
added like a nice pinky warmth to it I
really love that color and then for my
brow bone highlight I took a little bit
of Mooney and I highlighted the brow
bone and then this part listen listen
guys I had a lot of coffee right before
filming this video and I could not get
my eyeliner to save my life so I went in
with the Inglot gel liner number 77 and
I did the best I could add a winged
liner you know I try it's not my strong
suit I gotta say so I just popped on a
lot I really do think this look does
need a winged liner though I mean it
doesn't need it but I think it looks so
pretty with a wing and then I just
cleaned up underneath my eyes and I'm
moving on to the rest of my face before
well I'm moving on to the face before I
finish up the eyes I went in with my
Imani perfect 10 primer serum to prime
and hydrate the skin and then for a
foundation I really wanted kind of like
a flawless foundation look so I went in
with the Dior air flash Foundation which
turns out this isn't breaking me out I
thought it was but I guess it's not that
breakout above my eyebrow it wasn't from
this foundation
with something else but anyway I'm
applying this in my entire face this
color is a little too dark for me so I'm
trying to make it work and highlight
with my concealer and stuff so I went in
with the Tarte shape tape concealer in
light neutral to mask those dark circles
and to highlight the other areas of my
face
to set that concealer I went in with my
wedding wild pressed powder and warm
light I love this powder it's drugstore
but so good and I'm just using my little
setting brush to set my concealer down
okay so let's finish up the eyes before
we finish up the face I'm going in with
magical on my lower lashline on a big
fluffy pencil brush and then I'm gonna
go in with the shade potion and I'm
gonna do pretty much the exact same
thing only I'm gonna be a little bit
more precise with the shade not so all
over the place we're pretty much copying
the top lid so now I'm gonna take a
little bit of elfish and I'm just
focusing this color on the outer corners
of my eyes just to mimic the top lid
like I said I'm gonna apply some
eyeliner to my waterline this is the M
cosmetics
illustrative eyeliner in the shade black
and then I'm gonna pop on mooney on my
inner corners tiny to go in with some
falsies these are the Ardell glamour one
one three lashes I really love these and
then I popped on some mascara on top of
that and on my lower lashes as well this
is from thrive cosmetics I am loving
this mascara but to finish up the face
I'm gonna go in with my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer with this Lisa
Frank brush that I got on the IPPS eat
they had like a deal where they were
selling this brush one of my subscribers
tagged me on it and like a tweet or
something and I was like oh my gosh I
need to buy this brush so thank you to
my amazing subscriber because I did and
then I wanted to warm up the face just a
little bit more so I took another
Physicians Formula bronzer this is like
the mineral bronzer and I'm just adding
a little bit of this just to warm up the
complete chin
for blush I'm taking the laura geller
honeysuckle baked blush I love this
blush because it has like a soft
luminous glow to it
and I really really like it I'm just
popping that on my cheeks and then to
highlight the skin I'm taking the Ofra
highlight in glow goals
glow goals I feel like that is such a
tongue twister this is the
nikkietutorials highlight I love it so
pigmented so creamy so juicy so good I
love it so I'm just popping that on my
cheeks and a little bit on the nose and
then last but not least I'm popping on
this lip color this is the Kat Von D
everlasting liquid lipstick in the shade
Hilda it's such a nice warm matte Brown
this actually looks a lot like Taurus
from colour-pop just saying in case you
wanted a dupe but anyways that completes
this video I hope you enjoyed thank you
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye
