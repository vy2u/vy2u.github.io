another disappointing products video I
like to do these videos every few months
because you guys know I am constantly
trying out new makeup I'm always trying
out new things I'm always buying new
things I'm always getting sent new
things so I'm constantly trying new
things like I've said it 100 times and I
would say for the most part I tend to
like everything or at least I tend to
make it work find a use for it but there
are just some things I'm like some
things just don't work out for me for
one reason or another which is why I
have to give these disclaimers I know
they're annoying but I just gotta say if
something is in this video and it's your
Holy Grail product please don't take
that personal we're all so different and
we all like different things and what
works for you might not work for me and
what works for me might not work for you
I mean I watch a lot of disappointing
products videos or like products I
regret buying videos and a lot of the
times I'll see products that I really
love and I'll be like oh man that sucks
that it didn't work out for them because
I love it and I'm sure we cannot relate
to that or just we're all wired so
differently so these products
specifically just didn't didn't tickle
my pickle didn't work for me it's just
something about them something about
them I don't like okay so I'm gonna
start off with a bang here I feel like
this is a lot of people's wholly real
foundation at the moment this is the YSL
all ours foundation and there's only one
reason I really really don't like this
and it's because it breaks my layout I
have been trying it out on and off for a
while now and this just it breaks me out
it doesn't really give me pimples but
the next day after I use this I'll
notice I have a lot of whiteheads all
over my face or I don't know if they're
white hands exactly but they're little
white bumpy's all over my face I'd like
really irritates my skin come back who
is smoking nation says children under
six months of age ask a doctor if you're
six months you can't rock this
foundation but if you seven months old
you go put it on I don't know what's in
this product that irritates my skin so
much I don't know if it's like the
fragrance because it does have a scent
but I have a lot of foundations that
have a scent that don't break me out I
don't know what it is and obviously I'm
never ever gonna put this on my face
again for that reason so I paid a lot of
money for these and I just didn't work
out for me which is a bummer because
that's expensive but honestly I have so
many other foundations I like way more
than this that are so much more
affordable than this so
like I mean I liked it and had a nice
finish but I wasn't blown away by this
foundation anyway you know I'm saying so
that's just it just it's not my cup of
tea I don't know where to put this okay
so this next product isn't terrible it's
just I I don't like it this is the Sigma
chroma glow shimmer and highlight
palette I like the idea of this I like
the color selection like I like whether
we're going with this it's supposed to
be kind of like a more colorful
highlighting palette which even though I
don't really gravitate towards like the
blue pinky purple highlights I get it
it's nice I just don't really like the
formula of these highlights all that
much they're very dusty and I feel like
gonna really highlight the face like
this one in peaceful is almost met it's
not matte it's not matte but it doesn't
give you a highlight to the skin and I
thought this was gonna be the one I
liked because it's the most
natural-looking one in terms of color
but it's so chalky and dusty and I don't
like how it applies on the skin it's
gonna happen bro so it's just a little
bit better but again it's like a dusty I
don't know how to explain it but the
formula is it very high lady
it feels powdery and dry and I know that
powders are dry but it but it feels like
a dry powder am I making any sense
I hope so the only two I like our zeal
and Felicity awful is city small calm
these are pretty they're colorful but
they have a nice reflect to them they
look like highlights on the skin they're
less dusty than the other shades so
these are nice but I just I just don't
like the rest of these and honestly I
want to see Sigma do something
interesting and different I don't know I
feel like nobody talked about Sigma
anymore it was one of those YouTube
brands like back in the day when
everyone was using Sigma brushes and
everybody loved Sigma and it kind of
like fell off I was never like a
die-hard Sigma fan I do like a lot of
their brushes i still use so many of
their brushes they're great brushes but
their makeup has never blown me away I
even gave it to Amelia and she was like
oh girl I don't want this should they
don't like it either so I don't know can
we talk about this elf hydrating gel
mist please can we talk about this elf
is one of my favorite brands so I'm not
trying to hate on elf but this is a gel
product animist so just just imagine
what that feels like when you spray it
on your face
this is not good I don't understand it
elf has a lot of mists they have like
the illuminating mist they have a lot of
setting sprays and I like the majority
of them but this is a product that I
just don't understand when you spray it
it looks like a nice fine mist but it's
not it's very sticky uncomfortably
sticky I don't understand this it's
supposed to plump and hydrate maybe it
does really lock in the moisture and
plump your skin but I've tried this on
top of makeup hated it and I was like oh
maybe it's just strictly for underneath
your makeup try it that way and I didn't
like it made my skin feel tight and
weird and I just don't see the purpose
of it I don't see the use for it even
though it is an affordable product just
don't understand it
and I will never ever use it again
because it just does not feel nice on
the skin I have so many setting sprays
and like beauty mists that I love that
are hydrating and plumping and
righteously this next product is a brand
I recently discovered pretty new to
Sephora it is Lila B and I really like
the Lila be setting spray it's very
similar to the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist it's really really nice it's very
pricey but it's very very nice I also
really like the lila be like face powder
I think it has a nice finish very
natural this however I don't like this
this is the B stunning palette
perfection eye quad this little icon is
$58 I personally don't think this this
is watching like a $58 eye quad do you
know what I mean I mean it's nice it has
decent pigmentation you could totally
get like a very natural eye look with
this but no way is those worth fifty
eight dollars you can get this exact
quad pretty much at the drugstore by Wet
n Wild with the exact same pigmentation
because it's not like this is like a
five star eyeshadow it has like okay
pigmentation I'm not really happy with
this I kind of purchased this thinking
it was gonna be really rich and
pigmented because of the price point I
don't know if I had higher expectations
than I should but I was expecting to use
a very buttery delicious quad and it
kind of fell short and I know the
packaging is stunning and beautiful it's
very very heavy
rather money go into the formula versus
the packaging you know what I mean like
you could tone down the packaging a
little bit Lila and I'll still be okay
with it
if
means your actual product it's just
gonna be a little bit better you know
what I mean another little eyeshadow
thing I didn't really like but it wasn't
an arm and a leg so you know it's okay
this is the Burt's Bees eyeshadow trio
and shimmering nudes I have another trio
that has like purples in it I think it's
called a countryside lavender I haven't
tried that trio yet there's a deep
purple in that one that I really want to
try but this is okay I think when in
wild eyeshadows are way better they have
trios that hooks above this this video
is not sponsored by wet and wild by the
way I keep talking about them but
they're so affordable and so good and
they have a bunch of trios that I like
way more than this I think they have a
lot better pigmentation for its B's is
drugstore so it's affordable but it's
not the cheapest at the drugstore either
you know I really like this chocolate
color but I know myself I'm just not
gonna reach for this I don't see myself
using these I just doesn't have the
oomph I'm looking for you know I don't
know have you tried any of the other
ones are the other ones better than this
maybe shimmering nudes is a dud but have
you tried the rest I would love to know
your thoughts on these okay so I was so
looking forward to this Urban Decay
troublemaker mascara first of all the
packaging is beautiful
I think I saw like a few ads with this
product and people's eyelashes looked
crazy and voluminous but I didn't do
that for me I'm so bummed this didn't
really give me any volume it gave me a
decent amount of length but personally
for me I look for something that's a
little bit more voluminous versus
lengthening it just made my lashes look
like really skinny and there wasn't
enough drama to this I think everybody
cake has created other mascaras in the
past that I've liked more than this this
troublemaker one was just like I'm and I
don't think it's worth the money it's
like mmm okay so I'm truly shocked I
don't like this product I've read so
many amazing reviews on this I was
really looking forward to it as well I
thought oh my gosh I'm finally gonna
find a Mac painterly paint-pot dupe or
like a Mac soft ochre dupe this is the
Tarte lid lock I base in the shade buff
this made my eyelids look like there
were a hundred years old I don't know
why honestly I've tried it a couple of
times I was like maybe I didn't really
moisturize my eyes I have dry skin maybe
I need to give it a little bit more
moisture no if you have very dry eyelids
I don't think you would like this
product I mean I could be wrong I read
so many good reviews but for my skin
type it's just gonna work for me I
shadow would just skip on top of this it
really patchy things we're not applying
well on top of this because it just
looked so dry and I'm like what am I
doing wrong what's wrong with my face
everybody loves this and it just did not
work for me okay so my next product is
another highlight I feel like I have
highlights in every single dissapointing
products video I guess I'm just very
picky with my highlights I think that's
like the one makeup item I'm like very
late about this is the jus a powder
highlight in the shade rolls gold
jus a has some of the best highlights
I've ever used I've ranted about the
citrine situation in the past I don't
want to really get into it but I
definitely think they changed their
formula of their highlights before they
were like ultra metallic and wet looking
and now they're just not as good the new
citrine is still nice I can still use it
as slick as me ago but it's not like the
old citrine you know but this color in
rose gold i I don't like it to me it
just doesn't really highlight my skin it
just deposits a bunch of gold glitter on
my face the base of the color is nice it
has like a nice pinky rose undertone but
there's so many gold glitters in this I
don't like how it looks on the skin it
doesn't really look flattering on me
personally I just think they have other
highlights that are way nicer than this
if they would just take out all the
glitter and maybe replace it with like
an actual golden sheen it would be like
a really pretty dual chrome like that
would look really nice but this glittery
situation here is just not working for
me personally I've tried to use this a
couple times on the cheeks and every
time I put it on like ah I did I put it
on it looks a so shonky okay so this
next product the only reason it's
disappointing to me is because I don't
think it's worth the money those of
colors has like a very similar product
to this I think I've even seen a more
affordable brand besides those of colors
do something like this this is the Tom
Ford cream and powder eye color duo
thing you have the cream eyeshadow on
the bottom and then here at the top you
pop this open and you have your powder
shadow this is a great product like
there's nothing wrong with it it has
amazing pigmentation it looks stunning
like I've used this a couple times I'm
not gonna lie it is beautiful but it's a
62 dollar cream eyeshadow and yes you
get a cream and a powder but it's $62
you can just head on over to salsa
colors they have a ton of different ones
they look just like this so for that
reason I just don't think it's worth it
it's not necessarily disappointing so
maybe I shouldn't have put it in this
video it would be different if this was
like way better than those of color ones
but no they're like the same actually I
would love to do another dupes video I
haven't done a dupes video and such a
long time I can affordable dupes for
high-end makeup kind of video let me
know if you want to see that in the
comments below I'll gather up some
high-end makeup and I'll find some dupes
for them I also don't remember why or
when I bought this to be honest it's
really good it's just not not $62 good
you know okay and then my last
disappointing product is actually a hair
product I feel like I've spoken about
this in the past already but don't think
so cuz it was in my bin and the things
in my bin I haven't spoken about yet
well why do I feel like I've disliked
this in the past I don't know this is
the ode Eva curl shaping mousse or or ma
how the fancy people say it this curls
shaping mousse just didn't work for me I
do like a lot of what Eva products he
has like a golden hair oil that's really
really nice it's pricey but I really
like how it makes my hair feel this
makes my hair feel a little too crunchy
for me I usually go for mooses that are
meant for curly hair because I always
use mousse when I have curly hair just
to get the most out of my curls and
there's a few I really like I don't like
my hair to be too crunchy or like too
stiff when I use a little bit of this
it's not too bad but honestly I don't
think it does much for the price I have
other mooses that are a bit cheaper that
I like more than this it looked a little
bit more frizzy versus when I use other
mooses I don't know it just didn't work
for my hair I'm sure there's a lot of
people who love this mousse but for me
personally it just didn't work for me
I'm gonna give this to my mom see if it
maybe works out for her we have
completely different hair types so I
don't know maybe this works out for her
but for my frizzy puffy hair it just I
didn't like it yeah guys that completes
this video these were products I was
recently testing out and I just didn't
really like them that much
I know these videos seem very negative
and I hope I'm not coming off like too
harsh or too strong I'm really sorry if
I am but I'm just giving you my opinions
on products and why it is easy to work
out for me
