another one of my disappointing products
video I haven't done one since December
and you guys know I try to do these
every single month just because you know
I love doing monthly favorites videos
they're like my favorite videos to film
and a lot of you guys are always
requesting me to include like
disappointing products at the end of my
favorites videos but honestly I have so
many favorites but I feel like adding
more products would make the video just
like even longer so I like to dedicate
all my disappointments to one video so
that is what we are doing today these
are all products that just didn't work
for me for one reason or another or that
I just don't vibe with it doesn't mean
these suck I know a lot of people who
actually love a lot of these products
baby I mean there was just something
about these products that just didn't
they didn't sit well with me so if
they're your favorites don't be upset
with me we're still friends I still love
you we're friends
alright so I'm just gonna go ahead and
hop right into it
alright so my first product totally
disappointed me because I love this
brand so much by the way my nails are
really really chipped in this video just
ignore the ants anyway this is the drunk
elephant bestie jelly cleanser it has
cantaloupe it's supposedly really great
for you but I didn't I didn't like this
there was something about the formula
that didn't really sit well on my skin
and I felt that it didn't really clean
my skin the way that I wanted it to be
cleaned I don't like like a squeaky
clean feeling because I have such dry
skin but there was something about the
formula that just wasn't I didn't love
it but that's not what I really disliked
about it this has the world's worst
packaging ever I like the idea of it
don't get me wrong because all you have
to do is go like this
and it pops open and then you squeeze
out all the product and to close it you
just twist it like that
it's literally genius like it's amazing
but it leaks everywhere and I always
make sure to keep it really tightly
closed like I make sure I'm closing this
ish before I set it down on the window
in my bathroom like I definitely make
sure and then the next day when I go
take a shower again it leaks all over my
windows so there's like product all over
the bottom and that's expensive to be
leaky
you know what I mean it's a mess it
really is a mess and that makes me so
sad cuz I really do love you drunk
elephant I just don't know you okay so
next up we have a drug
a product that I don't understand these
are the new little eye shadows they're
like little eyeshadow quads but they're
kind of like in the same color family so
they just look like big giant eye
shadows but they are different colors
and these are from owl may I have
unapologetic which is this one and then
I have a thrill-seeker and when I saw
these inside of Walgreens or everywhere
I was I was like oh my gosh those colors
look absolutely beautiful like look at
this beautiful terracotta and these
blues are incredible and then I got home
and i swatched them and I was like what
listen listen I know that you can
totally make these work with a little
bit of fix plus I mean you can make any
eye shadow work with fix+ but these mats
are not pigmented enough and these
glittery shades are literally just
shimmer but there's no base to them
these are not good I'm sorry they are
not good and there are so many drugstore
eyeshadows that are worth it and they
actually work and perform well these are
not one of them Milani eyeshadows
amazing wet and wild eyeshadows amazing
these not so much any other like seven
bucks so they don't break the bank or
anything but for seven dollars you can
get better eyeshadows at the drugstore I
don't know if I just got two crappy ones
because when I was reading reviews on
Ulta like after I tried these on my eyes
I was like wait a minute this must have
one star on Ulta so when I went to check
the reviews some people really really
like them and I don't know if I just got
two really crappy ones I don't know let
me know in the comments below if you've
tried other colors that actually work
because I just don't I just don't get
these another product I very much
disliked these videos always get me so
pumped and angry but this is the it
cosmetics confidence in a compact more
like cakey grease and compact it says
it's for all skin types but I feel like
those of you with oily skin might not
like this it kind of has a very greasy
oily consistency like when you put your
brush in or your sponge it's very very
emollient which I would normally really
really like cuz I'm all about the do I'm
all about the glow but when I applied
this to my face and I blend it out it
looked like foundation it looked like I
had something sitting on my skin it
didn't look good around my nose or in
between my brows which are my trouble
areas it looked pretty cakey I just did
like how this looked on my skin I have
so many other like BB creams or
foundations other things I like way way
more than this just it looked like a
mess on my face like a hot mess I know
my cup of tea another thing that really
was not my cup of tea that I was so
freaking disappoint I was like really
disappointing with this guy this is the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi glow nude
palette when I first saw it I was like
oh my gosh amazing a highlighting
palette from the drugstore yes so again
this sucks this is the most powdery is
like dusty crumbly highlight palette in
the world like especially this shade
right here even when you're watching it
you're like what is this crumbly dusty
mess and then like what the heck is
there's it's horrible
these are so dry I would love to know
who is on the L'Oreal team that approved
this because I don't want to sound mean
I don't know I'm not trying to sound
shady but I can't picture a company
coming up with this swatching it using
it on their face and thinking like yeah
this is amazing because it's not like if
I worked at Lorri oh and we were having
a discussion on this product they'd be
like excuse me this is garbage
it just I don't know did I get a bad one
did I get a really dry one I just don't
understand how many of you tried this
palette it doesn't give you a sheen to
the skin it doesn't highlight your face
Lumi glow nude highlighting palette what
is this gonna highlight and I know that
that's harsh but for L'Oreal prices you
better be giving me a delicious sheen
okay
because I have brands like this this
Milani highlighting palette that's
freaking amazing buttery smooth a
beautiful sheen and it is cheaper than
this dust crust you know what I mean
like what all right moving on I kind of
got me a little riled up but my next
disappointing product it really just
disappoints me because of the formula
because I freaking love this color this
is the Kat Von D everlasting liquid
lipstick and this is in the shade
Hawkwind I love the name of this by the
way cuz it reminds me of Hawkins like
stranger things I shouldn't even
nail-polish Hawkins
leave me a comment down below what what
color you picture a Hawkins being anyway
so this is Hawkwind
and I have a love-hate relationship with
some of the Kat Von D liquid lipsticks
because I think they're amazing and the
formula is great they last all day on
the lips and I don't find them to be
drying but some of them have a very
streaky formula and this is definitely
one of them I don't know if it's just on
me but every time I apply this I have to
apply like four layers of this in order
to get an even application throughout my
entire lips like in order for me to
avoid streakiness or patchiness I have
to apply it a couple times which I don't
really like it kind of turns me off a
little bit and I don't reach for this
color anymore because of that so that
bums me out because the color is really
really pretty but I don't like how
sticky it is I'm sort of cut I love you
but I don't love this color okay so I
have two liquidy Luminizer type of
things that I did not like that did not
work for me and I dislike him both for
completely different reasons the first
one being the color pop crystal liquid
highlighter in amber I'm not sure if
this was limited-edition I don't know if
this is still available but when I first
got this in the mail I was like Oh
beautiful oh my gosh cuz this color
looks amazing you know what it reminds
me of I have like a real obsession with
the NARS hots and illuminator not the
powder highlight cuz down is a little
bit pink year but the hot sand in the
liquid version which i think was also
limited edition that one looks so
beautiful it kind of has like this color
to it and I love that one so I thought
this would be kind of like a dupe it's a
little bit more ambery than that one but
the color is just absolutely gorgeous
but I don't like this formula like at
first when you apply it and you start to
blend it out you're like oh how pretty
but once you blend it in that really
prey Sheen kind of goes away and you're
left with this like weird oily not very
shiny type of glow I don't know how to
explain it it just doesn't look glowy on
the skin and when I first use it I was
like oh you know what this might be
perfect for my body to give me like a
nice golden glow but even then I'll
blend it and I'll put it on my shoulders
and it looks okay but it just feels very
greasy and I don't really see a glow
like there isn't a sheen there's no like
reflectiveness to this it's just kind of
like a gold in the orange greasy color
oh my gosh I don't know how to explain
it I just really don't like this color
or the formula I don't know if it's both
combined that
don't really like but I just don't like
how this looks on my skin and ever since
I tried it like two or three times I was
like you know what I don't like this but
this I don't like because of the glitter
this is the cover effects glitter drops
and I mean their glitter drops so
obviously and I definitely think there
are a hundred ways you can use this this
would probably be really cool in a photo
shoot but for me like for the average
consumer I will never ever use this I
don't like this it is straight up oil
and glitter like that's all you get
folks oil and glitter and it looks
really really cool don't get me wrong
it's so cool like maybe on your body you
know what I haven't tried this on my
body maybe like on a night out on the
town this would look awesome on the body
I'm gonna I'm gonna freakin try that
that just sounded like a brilliant idea
to me when I try putting this on my face
I mean I don't even know what I was
thinking but I tried to highlight with
this I look like Edward Cullen's sister
whatever it is I do not like how this
looks on my face it kind of emphasizes
just a lot and it looks glittery and
weird and it just looks extremely
unnatural and you guys know how I feel
about my highlights looking cray-cray I
felt it's not my favorite let me know
that you've tried this have you tried
these on your body maybe these aren't
maybe are these for the body
am i dogging this product without doing
any research I don't know for me it's
just pure oil and glitter and if you're
into that then maybe you will really
really like these I mean they are
beautiful to look at but so far it has
disappointed me for my face that's for
sure okay something that is god-awful I
think out of everything in today's video
this is what has disappointed me the
most it wasn't even like a
disappointment it was more like a shock
I gotta say these are the Burt's Bees
micellar cleansing towelettes okay you
guys know I love these simple micellar
cleansing towelettes they're my favorite
wipes at the drugstore so when I saw
that Burt's Bees came out with my seller
towelettes I was like yes and these have
white Cyprus oil now I don't know what
white Cyprus oil smells like I really
don't know but these are the worst
smelling makeup remover wipes I have
ever used in my life they smell so bad
that I cannot even use them I cannot put
these on my face I have honestly just
been using
them to wipe away swatches like if I'm
you know swatching things for you guys
I'll use these to remove them and even
just taking them out of this thing like
they smell like dirty feet straight-up
dirty feet again if I were on the Burt's
Bees team and we were having a
conference about bees I'd be like bee
sting but I don't know what if I just
got a really bad batch have you guys
tried these they're the micellar
cleansing towelettes and they smell like
feet leave me a comment down below if
you agree or disagree because maybe it's
just mine okay we were almost done just
two more products this one wasn't
disappointing as much as it was like
pointless for me like I it does nothing
for me this is the benefit Porefessional
but this is the pearl primer this is
supposed to be like a radiant version of
their professional this is great for
filling in the pores just like the
original professional but it does
nothing for me in terms of luminosity I
think all they really did was get their
original professional and add a little
bit of a pearl to it like a little bit
of a sheen to it but honestly it's not
that different you know it's not a
noticeable difference on my skin like if
I put this on one side of my face and I
put the original professional on this
side the difference is so minimal that I
don't think it's worth getting this one
you know it honestly does does nothing
for me I don't know it's not my favorite
it also smells pretty strong like it has
a very strong floral scent okay so the
last disappointing product I want to
talk about today is something from the
Ulta brand this is the ultimate e
illuminating setting spray I was so
excited to get this haven't really tried
out that many products from the Ulta
brand but it is very affordable and I do
want to look into more products from
Ulta it says illuminating makeup setting
spray maximizes the longevity of makeup
and it is infused with micro pearls for
a salt highlighted finish okay that
sounds fabulous does it not and you know
what sure maybe it does give you a soft
pearl highlighted effect but the alcohol
in this product is so strong that it
completely throws me off of this like it
just throws me off I've used this twice
and the two times that I've used it my
face felt so incredibly tight
I can't even explain it like I know the
Milani make it last setting spray has
alcohol in it it's literally like oh
it's the second ingredient oh so is this
this is water and then the second
ingredient is alcohol denna and then
this is water and the second ingredient
is alcohol then at whatever that is yes
this makes my skin feel amazing
it makes my makeup last all day which is
the alcohol I know setting sprays that
are meant to prolong your makeup have
alcohol in them but this makes my skin
look awesome
it doesn't feel tight it honestly looks
amazing when I use this this is my skin
feels so tight and the two times that I
used it I really thought that I was
gonna break out from it because I was
just like what is this tight feeling I
did not like it at all I even smell the
alcohol so much more than the Milani one
like it is very very strong even though
the spray is really nice on it like it's
a nice fine mist I do not like the
formula or whatever the heck is in that
bottle it doesn't work for my dry skin
okay guys so that completes this video
