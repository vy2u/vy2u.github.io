like the jars where I keep my makeup
brushes in are just so boring and not
that cute at all so I kind of wanted to
spice them up put in a very subtle way
and not go too crazy and I found a DIY
on Pinterest that I'm gonna share with
you guys and it's this sea glass tint
that you can add to your jars and I
think it's so cute so well you will be
needing is a glass jar a mason jar any
jar will do I just this is my old pickle
jar so I use that you will need some
food coloring any food coloring will
work except the ones that are gel this
is just the neon one some Elmer's glue
that we will be mixing with water to
make homemade Mod Podge but if you have
Mod Podge that works to some dishwashing
liquid
you're also gonna need a paintbrush make
sure it's the one with the little sponge
tip at the top because it doesn't leave
streaks like a regular paintbrush wake
up any cup will do a measuring cup it
doesn't really matter and lastly a spoon
so the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna get started on our homemade
Mod Podge which is three parts glue and
one part water so for that we're just
gonna take our spoon and we're gonna
fill it up with Elmer's glue so we're
gonna put one full spoon of Elmer's glue
into the measuring cup and we are gonna
do this three times so three spoonfuls
of Elmer's glue
make sure you fill up the entire spoon
next we are adding the water so we're
just gonna fill up the entire spoon with
water and pour it into the measuring cup
now we're gonna do that again but this
time we're only adding half a spoonful
of water
next take a dishwashing liquid and only
put a tiny little drizzle of the liquid
into your measuring cup and now it's
time to add a food coloring because I
want that sea glass effect on my jars I
am gonna mix the blue and green to give
it like a teal seafoam green kind of
color so what you want to do is take the
blue and add three drops of that into
the measuring cup and then take the
green and only add one drop of that
now just take a little sponge paint
brush and mix everything together
you want to mix until it gets to that
really pretty teal color and everything
is smooth
and finally it's time to paint your jar
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put my
hand through it and start painting
downwards
it's just easier for me so you're gonna
take your little brush and start
painting now it's really really really
important that you do a very very thin
layer of this because if you add too
much it won't dry correctly and it won't
have that seaglass effect at all it will
just have a lot of streaks and it will
drip and it just it will be a disaster
so make sure that you just paint the
entire jar evenly and it's one thin coat
so just make sure that there are no
streaks and that you've coated the jar
pretty evenly
now once you're done you just want to
flip it upside down and let it dry that
way now I know I didn't paint that RIM
around the top but once the whole door
is completely dry I will go back and do
that so when your door is starting to
dry its gonna look like this and this is
what it looks like when it's completely
dry as you can see it has like that
frosty sea glass effect that's really
pretty and now I'm just gonna go back
and paint around the rim
and I'm sorry I'm like so out of the
shot there but
you know
and then I'm just gonna flip that upside
down again and let it dry again now if
you do mess up if you added too much if
you don't like how it looks you can just
run your jar under hot water and it'll
come right off and you can just start
all over so once your jar has completely
dried this is what it looks like and I
love it I'm obsessed with it it has that
frosty sea glass ocean e-type texture
where it doesn't feel smooth it
literally feels like there's a frost
lead layer on it I don't know I just
think it's a fun way to spice up old
jars and you can add flowers in it put
it on your windowsill or you can put
your makeup brushes in it like I did and
I just think it looks so delicate and
beautiful
I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope
you try it out thank you so much for
watching guys and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
