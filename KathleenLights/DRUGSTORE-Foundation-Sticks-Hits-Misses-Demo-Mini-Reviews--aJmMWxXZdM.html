long-awaited battle of the foundation
Styx video I will be doing two videos
like this a drugstore one and a high-end
one today is the drugstore version I
have six drugstore foundations to talk
about today and review them
I feel like foundation sticks are like
in right now and not necessarily with
drugstore I notice but a lot of high-end
brands are coming out with their own
foundation sticks so I thought it would
be cool to a bunch together and compare
them to each other and then I thought it
would be cool to do that with the
drugstore foundation sticks as well I'm
not gonna go in any specific order but I
am gonna categorize them like the first
to administer with you I would say
they're better for oily skin then the
other two I'm going to share with you
are good for like normal skin and then
the last two a miniature with you are
better for dry skin so there's a
foundation stick for everyone here I
thought it would be helpful if you saw
each individual foundation just on my
skin with no other makeup on so you can
see how it sits on top of the skin and I
know a lot of you guys prefer a brush
over a Beauty Blender or a beauty
blender over a brush so I did half of my
face using a damp sponge and I did the
other half of my face using a brush this
brush right here I don't know what it's
called but I know it's from Tarte and
I'm an idiot and I used the same brush
to apply each foundation on my face in
the demo so I'm totally sorry about that
but I did spray some cinema secrets
brush cleaner every like two foundations
I would clean it with cinema secrets
brush cleaner but for this side of my
face I did use a different damp sponge
each time so there's that I do want to
mention really quickly I always used a
primer underneath my foundation whether
it's the first time I'm using it doing a
review doesn't matter I always use a
primer so for each demo I do have on the
glossy a priming moisturizer underneath
just because it's a like solid good
primer it's very moisturizing and I find
that it sits really well
underneath my foundations so I just use
my trusty old glossy primer so the first
foundation I want to talk about is the
Revlon Photoready insta-fix foundation
stick it has an SPF of 20 and it is
$13.99 this one has really really great
reviews on the Ulta website but
personally from my skin type it just did
not work for me this is the only one of
the bunch that I was like oh I don't
ever want to put this on my face again I
would say this would be perfect for you
if you have oily skin because on me it
just really emphasized all my dry skin I
have very dry skin as I've said a
hundred times in the past but if you're
new to my channel I have brisket and
every time I try applying this with a
Beauty Blender it just does not work it
looks really patchy and it's really hard
to blend like this foundation is pretty
matte and it just does not blend well
with a Beauty Blender I would highly
suggest using a brush if you're going to
use this it just buffs out weight easier
with a brush in my opinion I find that
to be the case with a lot of foundation
sticks with regular liquid foundations
most of the time I will prefer a Beauty
Blender but with foundation sticks I
always gravitate towards a brush just
for me and my skin type it just sat on
top of my skin it didn't blend very well
it blended out a lot better on the side
with the brush but even then I just
didn't like how it's sat on my skin so
definitely check this out if you have
oily skin it has really good reviews on
Ulta and one really good thing I did
find with this foundation is it lasts a
really long time on my skin maybe
because it is matte but it did a really
good job of staying in place the only
thing I did notice though is that it
started to break up a lot around my nose
like after a few hours of wearing this
foundation it was just like coming off
on my nose and I feel like it was
emphasizing my dry skin more and more as
the day went on that was really just
around the nose area it's not tacky to
the touch like you don't have to set
this you can if you want to but you
don't have to which that I really do
like the shade selection isn't the best
but it's definitely not the worst out of
this bunch here they have nine colors
but they don't have anything for very
very deep skin tones which I totally
hate why do companies do that compared
to the other foundations I'm going to
share with you the shade selection isn't
the worst in the demo of these videos it
looks like I'm applying a lot well
actually I am applying a lot and a lot
of the times I go over with a second
layer just to see if it's buildable and
this one for me isn't buildable because
it is so Matt but I would say it's like
a medium coverage next up is the
Maybelline fit me shine free foundation
stick it says it's for a combination
skin and I totally agree with that I
would say this would work for you if you
have normal skin or oily skin or
something in between
this one is different
the sense that it's like a gel stick
foundation it also has like this little
dot in the middle of the foundation
that's supposed to like control your
oils it's what helps mattify the skin
and I totally agree with the claims of
this foundation it goes on creamy and it
has a powdery finish which I think it
does this is a foundation that doesn't
need to be set in my opinion it's not
tacky to the touch which I really like
but it isn't as drying as the Revlon one
I didn't have trouble blending this one
out with a Beauty Blender the way I did
with the Revlon one I find it blends
really well with a Beauty Blender and it
also blends really really well with a
brush I prefer a brush with this but you
could go either way with this one I
would say this also has a medium
coverage I find that to be the case with
a lot of these foundations but this one
is buildable in my opinion I did go over
it a couple times in certain areas that
I wanted more coverage and I liked it
it's pretty good I'm in the shade
classic ivory 120 oh I forgot to tell
you but in the Revlon foundation stick
I'm going to shade 120 vanilla huh 120
120 the shade selection is also not the
best with this one there are eight
shades only and it lasts actually a
decent amount of time on my skin I like
the wear time the only thing I notice is
in between my eyebrows it starts to
break up after a few hours I don't know
if it's because it's a little bit more
mattifying so it clings to the dryness
but right here in between my eyebrows
and around my nose that's where it
starts to break up first
but again nothing like the Revlon one
this one is also cheaper than the Revlon
one it is $8.99 but like on the Alltel
website people prefer the Revlon one so
I mean its foundation is so personal
because we all have different skin types
it's crazy okay so this guy right here I
would say it can work for any skin type
because it doesn't really lean Dulli or
like super matte either this is the
physician's formula super BB all-in-one
balm stick so technically it's not a
foundation it's not labeled as a
foundation it's more kind of like a BB
cream and I like this one I actually
think this one's really good I don't
like the color of it I'm in the shade
light but it's like not really my shade
it's a little bit too pink it has a
neutral undertone but I'm a little bit
warmer than the
this one is more on the pricey side at
$12.99 but Physicians Formula is known
to be a little bit pricier I don't love
this one with a Beauty Blender though I
find that when I try to blend it out it
is a little bit more patchy but I would
say it gives you kind of like a satin
finish and I definitely prefer the way
it blends out with a brush the Beauty
Blender kind of takes away coverage and
I found that I had to really apply like
a whole second layer with this in order
to get the coverage I wanted I mean it
is a beauty balm it's not supposed to
have like all this coverage but I found
that with a brush I got more coverage so
I would definitely say go with the brush
on this one I think it gives buildable
coverage like you could definitely build
it up it is still a light coverage but I
like it I think it's really nice
it isn't as matte as the other two
foundations I talked about but it's not
as dewy as the other ones I will talk
about either it has a very natural
finish to it which I really like it is
just a little bit tacky when you touch
your face with your fingers so I would
go ahead and set it if you have very dry
skin you can get away with not setting
it at all the one huge I'm talking like
huge major downside to this product is
there's like two colors I think there's
like two or three colors which is
ridiculous it's ridiculous I mean come
on Physicians Formula you're a great
brand you need to your your shade
selection sucks and it's not just for
this it's for everything they do not get
it right when it comes to shades and I'm
sorry I love you I truly do but get it
together if someone wanted to buy this
in the store they're either light or
light/medium and that's just like not
how it works there are darker skin tones
or even lighter skin tone there are 100
other skin tones if you are one of the
two shades then I think it is a pretty
good quick at the door every day like
coverage kind of thing next stick
foundation is one from NYX this is the
NYX Cosmetics mineral stick foundation
I'm in the shade light/medium and I
really really really like this one I
love the shade selection they have like
15 different shades to choose from which
is amazing especially compared to the
other ones I just previously talked
about so in terms of variety NYX
definitely takes the cake with this one
now this one compared to the other ones
I've spoken about I actually prefer the
way it blends out with a Beauty Blender
most accound Asians
I like how they blend out with a brush
but this one I actually prefer the
Beautyblender
it has a very beautiful dewy finish
perfect if you have dry skin and I just
feel like when I blend it out with the
brush it kind of sits on top of the skin
versus with the Beauty Blender it really
just makes it sink right into the skin
and look really natural and I also found
I don't know if it's just me but I found
that when I use the brush it emphasized
my pores more than when I used the
Beauty Blender so just keep that mind
maybe I'm crazy but that's just the way
I feel once you're done blending this
out it is a little bit tacky when you
put your fingers to your face that's
usually the case with dewy foundations
so I would definitely 100% set this one
but once you set it it looks so so
pretty I would say this has a light to
medium coverage definitely buildable to
be honest I haven't found a foundation
stick at the drugstore that has extreme
full coverage I love how it lasts on my
skin as well it doesn't break up weird
it fades really nicely this one costs
$9.99 and I really really like it this
next one um is pretty good I don't like
it nearly as much as I like the NYX one
but it's not bad this is from flower
beauty and this is their skin Cognito
stick foundation it has a very amoliant
texture to it so I do feel like if you
have any oil enos to your skin you won't
really like it but it is very very
hydrating I would say it works either or
I think it works really well with a
Beauty Blender and it also works really
well with a brush I got would definitely
consider this a light coverage
foundation but it is buildable you can
get a medium coverage if you build it up
this one is very tacky to the touch you
1000% are gonna want to set it and it
looks really beautiful it looks really
natural it's just it doesn't last that
long like it doesn't last as long as the
other ones it kind of breaks down
quicker than the other ones I spoke
about but I don't think it's bad I do
like this one more than the Revlon one
and she has a total of 5 shades in her
line which I don't like I mean I think
there should be more shades but at least
is not as bad as the Physicians Formula
One's
I feel like this is also a really good
foundation for every single day when you
don't want too much coverage but you
want your skin to look nice and fresh
and dewy and natural this is a really
nice one to go for and it retails for
$8.98 if you don't know you can get
flower Beauty at Walmart exclusively ok
and then the last one I think it is my
personal favorite I don't know what it
is
about it but I just I really like this
one this is the elf moisturizing
foundation stick I'm in the shade nude
and it's the foundation I'm wearing on
my face right now there are only three
colors to choose from such a bummer I
would love it if they expanded their
range and brought out more foundation
sticks because I really like this one
this is definitely one for you if you
have dry skin even very dry skin it is a
very dewy finish
Packaging reminds me a lot of the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD stick I don't know
if that's what they were going for but
it reminds me a lot of that I actually
love the packaging on this one it's my
favorite I don't know if it's just
because it's like a chubby one it's like
fatter and shorter and it's black and
sleek I think the other ones look a
little bit less expensive and this one
just looks nice and modern I don't know
I'm crazy but I like packaging this
one's awesome for a ton of different
reasons
it's very dewy so it works well with my
skin and it looks so natural and so
beautiful this one has really really
good coverage it can go from medium to
full if you build it up I actually also
prefer this one with a Beauty Blender I
think it looks even dewier and even
prettier I love the brush as well it has
a slight tacky finish even though it is
dewy it's not as tacky as the flower one
so if you have extremely dry skin you
can get away with not setting it but I
would set it anyway because if you don't
sometimes when you put on bronzer or
blush or anything on top it will stick
to that certain spot so I would
definitely set it anyway it does start
to break down around my nose after a few
hours I don't I don't exactly know why
but I look past that because I literally
like everything else about it it has
shea in it vitamin E avocado it even has
like aloe in it to really hydrate the
skin I don't know it's definitely my
favorite out of all of them that's just
my personal experience shade selection
not very good they need to fix it and
this one is also the cheapest is it this
is six bucks so yeah I think it is the
least expensive one and it happens to be
the one I like the most so yeah that
completes this video these were my
thoughts on these six foundation sticks
from the drugstore
I'm not going to lie I think that
high-end brands make better foundation
sticks but I do have other liquid
foundations at the drugstore that I
prefer over these so when it comes
through the drugstore I think that they
do liquid
nation's better than stick foundations
yeah I was pleasantly surprised with a
lot of these leave me a comment down
below if there was a drugstore
foundation stick I might have missed
maybe it's one that you love and I
didn't include but I love doing this
video for you guys I can't wait to film
the high-end version of this video so
stay tuned for that yeah that completes
this video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
