an affordable drugstore ha mainly
products from Ulta I'm gonna be sharing
some affordable body care hair care and
makeup so have a little bit of
everything in this video and I'm really
excited for today's video because it is
actually sponsored by batiste dry
shampoo I'm gonna share with you a
couple but these products I picked up I
got them why I love them and then I will
share with you the rest of the stuff so
let's just jump into it so I got three
different batiste dry shampoo from Ulta
I got two full-size bottles
I lost the cap I've just been using this
like all week and yeah I lost the cap
but I got my favorite one this is the
one I used to use back in the day if
you've been watching my channel for a
really really really really long time
since the beginning you would recognize
this guy this one is in the scent fruity
and cheeky cherry out of all of the
petites dry shampoos this one is my
absolute favorite it smells so good it
smells like cherries and it stays in
your hair you guys know I talked about
dry shampoo a lot on my channel I love
dry shampoo I do have my favorites but
when it comes to drugstore when it comes
to an affordable dry shampoo every time
somebody asks me what I recommend it's
always batiste out of all the affordable
ones batiste is the way to go it's my
absolute favorite it really is just so
affordable yet it does an amazing job of
leaving your hair feeling clean excuse
the light by the way the sun is shining
like really intensely through my windows
but this is really easy to use if you've
never tried a dry shampoo I like using
it on my hair after about the second or
third day when my hair is starting to
get a little bit greasy I'll just shake
up the can and I'll hold it about like
12 inches away I mean I ballpark it and
then I'll kind of just part my hair kind
of section it off and spray this
directly into my roots or areas where I
notice that my hair is extra greasy and
now I'll just take my fingers and really
massage my head get all up in there and
make sure that the white powder does
dissolve and at first it can be a little
bit scary especially if you have brown
or black hair but honestly after just a
few minutes of massaging it into your
scalp that white cast does completely go
away and you don't see it anymore but I
do know petites has some for brunettes
it kind of has like a dark tint to it so
if you're worried about the white powder
that is probably the way to go this one
is a travel spray I personally I travel
and I think it's totally necessary to
take one of these things versus this cuz
this is just a pain to travel with so
the tiny little dry shampoos are the way
to go and I got this scent tropical I've
never tried this one before
it says it smells like coconut actually
let me spray it and so it oh that smells
good
that literally smells like a tropical
vacation I always get my batiste dry
shampoo either at Ulta or warmer but
definitely mainly Ulta for me and yeah I
just think the taste is great I'm gonna
have a link down below in case you want
to buy these or check it out it really
does do its job I actually have a
batiste all over my hair right now and I
haven't washed it in almost a week I may
seem a little gross but the video that
went up on Monday night I had done my
hair the day before I filmed that which
was Thursday I washed my hair on
Thursday and I'm currently filming this
video on Wednesday so it's been almost a
full week since I washed my hair and it
doesn't really look that greasy to me I
mean yeah it's not perfect but I think
it's good I love batiste and thank you
so much for sponsoring this video
they're amazing and now we can move on
to the other products I got IOLTA
by the way guys I just got new
Invisalign trays yesterday and it's
extremely painful every time I take them
off and put them back on for like the
first three days so I just kept in my
bottom one right now because my bottom
one is the one that's really really
hurting me this time around so hopefully
it's not too annoying please bear with
me it's just it's I got a lot of Milani
goodies but I'm gonna go through the
rest of like the body care kind of stuff
before we dive into makeup so I got a
new body wash this one's from Aveeno and
it is their stress relief of body wash
with lavender chamomile and yang and I'm
never know how to say that yang ylang
ylang ylang
but it supposedly calms and relaxes
while moisturizing the skin so I'm very
excited to use this because I've had a
very stressful couple weeks and I could
use all the help I can get I don't
really smell the lavender though I mean
maybe I think I smell more of the
chamomile which I'm okay with cuz I love
chamomile but hopefully this does relief
my stress speaking of showers and baths
I got two more showery bath products I
don't know those dry shampoos
inspired me to get more affordable like
body care products I got this from shea
moisture the lighting you can't even see
the bottle so bright in here
this is they're a hundred percent virgin
coconut oil coconut milk bath powder it
has coconut milk powder coconut oil
organic shea butter and a bunch of other
delicious things they saw in the bottom
it doesn't smell the best I don't know
if I'm smelling the plastic or if I'm
smelling the product I could definitely
smell a faint coconut scent but I'm
gonna have to use it in the bath to
really see if I love it and how it feels
on the skin I really love Bath powders
like this I had one from the brand
herbivore that was really amazing it was
also like a coconut powder so I thought
I would try this out because it seemed
like a drugstore version of it so I will
I will check that out and then this this
has been on my mind for a while now this
is the Jergens wet skin moisturizer it's
in the original scent but it says it has
organic cherry almond essence and so I
don't know if it smells like oh yeah
that smells amazing
so this is basically an in shower
moisturizer and you're supposed to use
this after you've already cleaned your
whole body like you go in there you wash
your body then you go in with this
product you apply everywhere you rub it
in and you don't even have to rinse it
off you just go in with a towel and dry
yourself down and supposedly it's like
really really amazing it leaves your
skin really moisturized and supple and I
feel like this is the perfect product
for me because I always apply just like
hand cream and I'm out the door and
sometimes I use my hand cream like on my
elbows and stuff but I never like Dallas
my whole body so I'm really excited to
try this cuz maybe this means I have
super moisturized skin without feeling
like trapped in moisturizer so yeah pick
that up alright and then the last like
non makeup products I got is also from
Shea Moisture this is the yuca and
plantain anti breakage strengthening
mask and I bought it because it has you
got blunting I live eating those things
but then I'm a little and yoga mmm
delicious but anyway this has nothing to
do with food that you eat this is for
your hair it says it has baobab oil
whatever that means and cilantro extract
and it's supposed to be for frizzy split
and
King here and I feel like I have all of
those things so I need anything that's
anti-breakage right now I'm not even
sure if you can tell but like yeah you
can tell you could totally tell I can
see all the breakage I have right here
I'm trying to look for anti breakage
products and I thought I would give this
one a shot I still haven't used it yet I
think I'm gonna use it today when I wash
my hair and I'll see how that goes and
then the rest of the products are kind
of like makeup either definitely in the
Beauty category so it's mainly stuff
from Milani but I did get a couple of
other things I'm just gonna go through
the Milani stuff first I have been so
excited for these palettes you guys have
no idea since the second since I saw
that they released I was like I need
that in my life and they have been
sitting in this box waiting for like the
past week to do this video I got the
bold obsessions palette and I also got
the must loves matte palette and they
are beautiful like in terms of packaging
they're stunning they're a great brand
so I don't expect like crappy products
from them but I love this packaging this
is so beautiful and look at this palette
it is exquisite it is stunning why it's
called bold obsessions because you will
be you will be obsessed and then I got
the must loved mattes palette which this
one is just full of completely matte
shades this one in both obsessions has a
little bit of both you do have like nice
shimmery glittery shades and then you do
have a couple mats running all
throughout it so if I had to pick one I
think I like the bold obsessions just a
little bit more because you get a
variety of different textures but if
there's someone who just likes matte
colors and you're into warm shadows then
you will love this because all of these
mats are really creamy really delicious
I have a mixture of both of these on my
eyes right now I have found so many
pallets at the drugstore that just
aren't that good and these are really
really good at least the shades I've
used so far I really like how this eye
look turned out and then I got these two
powders from Milani and one eye
and one I do not these are too loose
setting powders one of them is
translucent and then this one is called
radiant this one in translucent this is
this is not translucent
okay this has a very select Sheen to it
it's nothing crazy it's not glittery or
shimmery but there's definitely a sheen
to it
I used it to set my under eye concealer
and wow wow I did not like it it made my
under eyes look really dry surprisingly
I don't know what it was about it I have
used the concealer I used a hundred
times with a hundred other setting
powders and it didn't give me that like
crusty look like this did I don't know
if it's the sheen that's making my skin
look weird but this is not for me but
this one though this is beautiful this
is basically a loose highlighter but a
very very very natural loose highlighter
I actually used the tonight on my entire
face but I didn't like set my face with
it I just took a really big fluffy brush
and just dusted this really lightly all
over my entire face and it just gave me
the most beautiful subtle sheen ever
feel like I'm gonna be using this a lot
I think I found a new favorite product I
don't know if you can tell obviously not
like at the tops of my cheekbones but I
pretty much just like doesn't this
everywhere I feel like it gave my skin a
nice soft luminous glow and I am
obsessed I also got this palette I was
so excited for this one this is the rose
glow stellar lights highlighting palette
this one in rose gold only works for me
when I'm really really tan like when I
have my fresh self-tanner on this white
one I would only use when I'm extremely
fair so basically the only one I've
tried on my actual face is the gold one
all of these have a really creamy
texture
they just feel like butter and when
you're applying them to your skin they
give you such a nice Sheen it's not
glittery it's not chunky I really really
like these I would like for Milani to
come out with maybe like another trio
that has deeper shades because I don't
think these would necessarily work on
very deep skin tones I have the gold one
on my cheeks today but I actually have
it sitting on top of another highlighter
that I used that I will get into in a
second but I am very very happy with
this and then to finish off the Milani
portion of this video I got some lip
products I got two of their new I mean
I'm pretty sure they're new this is the
keep it full nourishing lip plumpers I
haven't actually tried these yet but I'm
very very excited - I got the shade nude
shimmer and almost natural very nude
colors I know and I'm super open to try
lip plumpers as long as they're not
extremely painful I don't mind having
like a little plumping effect I just
don't want to cry in the process so
hopefully these are good but the other
that products I got from Milani I think
I'm gonna freaking love these I'm
wearing one on my lips right now and I'm
obsessed I have a Catrice lip liner
underneath I have this one I think it's
called like cafe something it's the
lightest patreese lip liner they have
but then I have this one on top these
are the more I shine liquid lip colors
they sound super familiar I don't think
these are new maybe these shades are new
but I got the shade delight which is the
one on my lips and then I got enchanting
which is like a deeper pinky mauve this
one actually is not a amore Shine liquid
lip color this one this is a glittery
like lip gloss and it's called their
stellar lights holographic lip gloss and
I got mine in the shade luminous peach
these holographic lip glosses aren't my
favorite but when it comes to colors
like this they're a little bit more
wearable and I feel like I would really
really like this one I feel like this
would look beautiful on top of life this
must be the most like beautiful
delicious duochrome e-cloth effect ever
like I cannot wait to try this combo but
yeah I got that lip gloss and then like
I was saying I got these shine liquid
lipsticks feel long-wearing I don't know
if that makes any sense it has a super
super nice formula I can't even describe
it but I love the feeling on my lips
I've actually been wearing this color
for like three hours now and I love how
this one is nude but it has a really
pretty like pearly Sheen to it those
were all the new Milani products I
picked up but I got a couple other other
stuff as well so I got this just because
of Casey Holmes here on YouTube I love
her so much she uses the Real Techniques
body sponge on her face you know the
miracle complexion sponge from Real
Techniques they have one for your body
it's called the miracle face and body
sponge look how giant it is
and I haven't even wet it like I'm gonna
show you in comparison look at the size
difference but it's insane that is crazy
I could just imagine how big this gets
when you wet it and at first I was like
no way but I feel like what I really
want to do my makeup really fast and I
want to apply my foundation in two
seconds this will be perfect
ooh this next product okay I'm a little
bit of how the kids say shook I'm a
little bit shook so these are the Ardell
magnetic lashes I've kind of seen these
going around YouTube for awhile and I
thought that is ridiculous like there's
no way that that would work if this is
the top row and this is the bottom row
so you put the top one on top and then
you grab the bottom lash and you put it
on the bottom of your natural lashes and
they're supposed to like magnetized
together and you have boom beautiful
fall please I haven't tried these just
yet but I'm actually wearing magnetic
lashes right now I have the accents on
and they're the ones that are just like
half lashes so I have them on and
they're like from here to the outer
corners so I feel like that's why they
look as wearable as they do or I feel
like that's why they were so easy to
apply because they're just acts and
lashes so I'm gonna pick up some more
because dude I'm wearing magnetic lashes
right now and I feel like they kind of
look good I feel like they kind of look
pretty natural like let me zoom you in
I'm wearing magnetic falsies no glue it
took me five seconds five seconds to
apply this I mean there was definitely
some trial and error especially with
this eye this is like my wonky eye you
have to get them perfectly evenly
matched so that they could stick
together and not look weird I mean you
can still see like the magnets on my
eyes like when I go like this you can
see the magnet all you have to do is
apply like some black eyeliner to your
tight line I just didn't do that and
then I feel like they would look a lot
more natural but I mean am I crazy or
does that look pretty good I cannot tell
you how impressed I am with these accent
lashes I don't know I'm gonna feel about
these cuz they're like a full strip but
I am definitely getting some more
accents because I feel like you can use
them a hundred million times because
there's no glue involved I feel like
everybody else who's tried these have
hated them but these accents so okay so
we are almost done I got another powder
this is the covergirl vitalist healthy
powder I just recently found out that
they came out with a ton of new
covergirl products and they're all like
in this type of packaging I really want
to try like the luminous it's kind of
like a liquid highlighter that I saw
Emily Noelle used in a recent video or
talked about in a recent video so I
really want to buy that but I just had
no idea there were so many new products
I just picked up the vitalist healthy
powder and I got mine in the shade
classic ivory and I'm actually wearing
this all over my entire face this is
what I used to set my foundation and I
really really liked it it like feels
almost creamy and I really like how it
set my face like it didn't make my skin
look dry or anything so healthy powder I
see that and then I got this highlight
this is actually the highlight I'm
wearing underneath that Milani one I was
talking about this is the elf coffee and
cream highlighter duo it's their collab
with Hart and honestly that's why I
purchased it I just really love buying
collabs from other youtubers just to
show my support especially with an
affordable brand like elf like look at
this packaging this is beautiful
congratulations Hart and these
highlights are really really pretty you
get like a more golden color and then a
like pinky pearl color and I mixed both
of them to use on my face today just
because this one is definitely too dark
for me so mixing them together gave me
such a pretty glow to the cheeks and I
really really like it and then last but
not least I got the Mario Badescu
facial spray this one has aloe chamomile
and lavender and I wanted to pick this
up because I don't know if you guys saw
my Monday video but I've been using the
Cora organics calming lavender mist and
this is a high-end product pretty
expensive so when I saw this I was like
yeah is that a dupe because that one
also has aloe vera I actually use it on
my skin today to prep underneath my
foundation and I used it to set my
foundation kind of gave me like a nice
dewy glow and you get a lot of product
and it's pretty affordable so I'm very
very excited for this yeah guys that
completes this video these were all the
products and recently picked up from
Ulta I hope you enjoy this video let me
