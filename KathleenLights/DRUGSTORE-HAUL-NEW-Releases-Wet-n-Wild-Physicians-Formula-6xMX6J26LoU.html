huh I recently placed an order on the
Physicians Formula website and on the
wet and wild website so we are doing a
drugstore haul today I want all the new
what a while of all the new Physicians
Formula stuff I feel like they've
recently come out with so many things
and I purchased quite a few of them I do
get PR from Wet n Wild but I've been
seeing these pallets like everywhere for
the past few weeks and I hadn't gotten
them in the mail so I decided to place
an online order and pick up a few things
that had my eye on okay so I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started because I
know I know this video is really long I
can just I can just tell by looking at
this box that this video is really long
I'm gonna start with the wet n wild
stuff first so the main reason I even
jumped on the wet wild website was
because of these magical brushes I
recently just launched this like rose
gold collection they remind me of the
Real Techniques brushes these basic they
look very similar very very similar and
they're actually just as soft I believe
the wet and wild brushes are a little
bit cheaper than the Real Techniques one
is
Real Techniques ones as well I think
it's so pretty this is the pro brush
line and they look a little bit more
high quality than all of their other
brushes but they're still really
affordable I think like the most
expensive brushes like $7.99 so I was
really excited to get my hands on these
I used them today for the first time
when I was doing my face makeups but
then I just like kind of clean them a
little bit so you wouldn't see them all
dirty and I really like them they are
synthetic some of them are a little bit
stiffer than I would like like this one
this is the p20 it's a nice fluffy
crease brush but I like my crease
brushes to be a little bit fluffier than
this this is just a little too stiff for
me but I really like this one this is
the P 60 and applied my bronzer really
nicely and I even applied my blush with
this and then I put on my foundation
with the P 70 as well but this one would
be awesome for like pressed powder my
favorite one though I have to say is the
P 65 this one blended on my concealer so
fast and so flawlessly and I also used
it to set my under eye concealer as well
and it works like a charm
and I also really really like the P 15
it's kind of like the Mac 217 and
and did a really great job of blending
out my I show so so far so good some of
these are like I'm and I'm like this one
I don't really like this one is the p55
not my favorite I don't like the shape
of it but for the price you cannot beat
these they are so soft and I cannot wait
to use them more and then I got four of
their eyeshadow palettes I think they
have one more or did I get all of them I
don't remember but they recently redid
everything and they like reformulated
everything and I'm not gonna lie when I
first saw this I had a mini heart attack
because this is the new comfort zone
palette if you guys are familiar with
the original comfort zone this is the
new one this is the old comfort zone
palette which I've used a ton on my
channel back in the day and I still use
this I still love this palette it is so
good and there was a while there where I
felt like wet and wild had really fallen
off their formulas just weren't the same
their eyeshadows weren't performing like
they used to and it was really concerned
when they saw they reformulated
everything and they released new pilots
and honestly I haven't used the new
comfort zone on my eyes yet to let you
know if it's just as good I have a
feeling I am gonna like this because I
used to other pilots on my eyes today
and it really liked how it turned out so
I'm hoping their new formula is a good
one
I'm actually gonna be showing you guys
side-by-side swatches of the original
comfort zone versus the new comfort zone
just so you guys can see and honestly
they are pretty similar the new one has
two extra shades that the original did
not and then I also got these three to
check out this one is called rose in the
air I'm actually wearing a couple shades
from this one I'm wearing this color all
over my crease right now I love this
shade it's labeled transition it is so
peanut buttery and amazing and super
easy to blend I really like that one a
lot and then I have these two cranberry
shades like on the outer corners of my
lids and then I have this gold all over
the lid the mattes
in these palettes are so good so
pigmented and so easy to blend the
shimmers are just a little trickier but
I mean you can still make it work this
goal is really really pretty and then I
have not a basic peach I have a couple
shades from this one on my eyes as well
I have this color in my outer corners I
have this matte chocolate color on my
eyes as well and I even have
this orange in my crease a little bit
and this one has my brow bone highlight
that is my whole look there you go I
haven't tried any of the shimmers in
this one and then I also got this one
this is nude awakening this is the new
version which I'm excited to try this
one as well and so far so good I can't
complain with those palettes but they
also released little quads and this is
the one that really got me these quads
really got me because they have one
called walking on eggshells and this one
in silent treatment which if you've been
watching my channel for a long time you
know silent treatment and walking on
eggshells these are wet and wild
classics like why why why do you
discontinue a good thing good wild why
these were the perfect little trios I
even have an entire wedding makeup
tutorial that I did using this trio it
was a drugstore Bridal look and now they
have reformulated them and relaunched
them and now their quads not trios this
one broke in the mail which I'm so sad
because I was most excited for this
shimmery color right here I liked it
there quads now though because they
added a transition shade to both of them
which they didn't have before so that's
nice and I have to use them on the eyes
but they do swatch really beautifully
and same goes for silent treatment I
don't know if it's just as good as my
original and you compare the eyelid
shade to the original eyelid shade and
the silent treatment trio it doesn't
match up to me I feel like the original
eyelid shade is a little bit more
pigmented a little bit prettier but I
don't kind of want to get my pennies in
a twist I really want to try these out
on my eyes to make it fair judgement and
then I got these as well this one is
hooked on vinyl and this one is pedal it
my hooked on vinyl also broke the shade
I was most excited for also broke in
this palette but they have this one
swatches so pigmented Lee by the way
really really stunning color selection
I'm very into it
alright so enough eye shadow talk when
in wild now has a cushion foundation how
exciting is this
this I've been waiting for this ever
since they came out with their cushion
highlight this is the mega cushion found
it has SPF 15 I got mine in the shade
cream ivory
it's the foundation I'm wearing on my
face right now and this color is a
little bit off for me I feel like the
undertone is almost grayish but besides
that I think this is a really pretty
day-to-day foundation it did settle into
my lines a bit once I applied powder but
I really did like the finish I like how
it looks on the skin it's very natural I
would say this has a sheer to medium
coverage because when I first applied it
I was like oh my gosh
I barely have any coverage but I did two
layers of it and it gave me awesome
coverage and I didn't feel like it got
cakey or too thick once I applied those
two layers so I was really impressed
with that I'm gonna try this out a
little bit more but so far so good for
the only thing it does have a scent but
it's not a bad scent I don't know if
it's the SPF but I feel like there's a
little bit of fragrance in here I don't
know when I saw that what in wild came
out with these like liquidy
delicious-looking highlights I got
really excited I picked up three colors
this golden one is called gilded glow
this iridescent purple EU white unicorn
II kind of highlight you know you know
those this one is called halo graphic
and then this really pretty pinky
champagne color is called halo goodbye I
was a little bit how do the kids say it
these days shook when I saw that these
were glass I got these in the mail was
like oh my god this is glass I might
make up me some even plastic bottles
acrylic bottles things that are not
easily broken they have to be very
careful with these because I drop
everything but anyway these are really
awesome and I really like that it comes
with a doe foot like sponge applicator I
thought I was gonna have to pour this
out onto the back of my hand but no no
thank God I like the applicator on this
and these are perfect to just apply
right to the tops of the cheekbone it
gives you such a beautiful glow I mean
I'm gonna be honest this is the only one
I've used I cannot vouch for the others
but this one is so stunning it is a
little bit too dark for me I wish they
would come out with a gold that was a
little bit lighter than this but I can
make it work it's just so pretty and
reflective the only thing I will say
about these is do not apply these on top
of powder I tried it yesterday on my
bare skin and I loved it
and then I tried it today on top of my
powder and it didn't work I had to like
really blend it in and then I popped
another highlight on top because it was
just looking a little crazy so
definitely keep that in mind but besides
that these are so stunning and
affordable definitely check these out
all right two more products Before we
jump into some Physicians Formula stuff
how incredible are these I know these
aren't new I mean I don't know if these
colors are new but they're new to me and
I cannot wait to use these how crazy are
these colors I can't wait oh my gosh
should I get two of the same color is it
okay so I got four of the mega last
liquid catsuits liquid eyeshadows I
haven't tried these out yet and I've
kind of heard a lot of buzz about them
when I saw these amazing jewel toned
colors on the website I was like yes I
need them in my life I have cosmic teal
black is the new black
emerald gaze and then this purple one
that I don't know the name of because
the sticker came off say oh I'm sorry
but these are so incredible they remind
me of the color pop supernova shadows or
the Stila stay all day liquid eyeshadows
as well it's very similar vibe but these
colors are just to die for I love them
let me know if you've tried these out do
you like them do they last all day is
there any fallout let me know what you
think cuz I am so excited alright so
when a while has a new face primer and
this is their dewy face primer I was
really excited to purchase this because
I have very dry skin as I'm sure a lot
of you guys know and I'm all about
primers I love primers I'm always on the
hunt for the best most beautiful dewy
hydrating primer you know I'm always on
the hunt so I was really excited to try
this out
I used it yesterday for the first time
and I really liked it I didn't love it I
wasn't blown away by it but I really
liked the luminosity it gave my face the
only thing is it's not as moisturizing
or as hydrating as I wanted it to be it
doesn't claim to be though it doesn't
claim to be for dry skin but I wish it
just gave me a little bit more of that
but it's not too bad it didn't wash rice
a bit and I really loved like the glow
it gave my face so I think I'm really
gonna like using this you
mixed in with more hydrating primers I
can't wait to try this out more because
I feel like it has a lot of potential
all right so now let's move on to the
stuff I got from Physicians Formula
there's not as many things but those
things I felt I needed to talk about
let's start off with the reason I even
went on the Physicians Formula website
to begin with they released more butter
bronzers I was so excited for this
because they only have to butter bronzer
and they're both very light there's one
that's called light bronzer and then one
that's called bronzer there they're
naming is so strange by the way but
anyway I always felt like they needed
something just a little bit deeper and
they release more shades I still think
they need to come out with a bronzer
that's even deeper than this but I
picked up deep bronzer and sunkissed
bronzer I'm actually wearing deep
bronzer on my skin right now it's the
only bronzer I have on and for my skin
too and it is pretty deep you get color
on your skin like right away I feel like
with their original butter bronzer like
the one I used labeled bronzer that one
I have to build up a little bit which is
what I really like about it it has a
kind of like a cooler undertone that
one's perfect to contour with this one I
really like as well I didn't think I was
gonna like it because at first I was
like oh my gosh this this wouldn't have
kind of like a reddish undertone I kind
of feel that way a little bit but once I
apply it to the skin I ended up really
liking it has such a soft beautiful
sheen I can't explain to you how
beautiful these bronzers are it's these
are honestly like some of the best
bronzers at the drugstore it's so easy
to blend so creamy and smooth I am in
love with the butter bronzers they're
amazing and then the other one I got was
Sunkist bronzer I really like this one
as well I used this shade in the video
that's coming up next Friday's video and
I really love the soft sunkissed glow I
gave my skin it really has the perfect
name because it has that warm undertone
but it's not too orange or too golden or
too shimmery it's literally just perfect
I love okay something I'm not obsessed
with something that did not work for me
this is the brow last long wearing
brow gel I'm sure for those of you who
like pomades
or Joe's like this where it's like
liquidy pomades
and maybe you would like this but
for someone like me who just strictly
uses powders and pencils this was just
too harsh for me I like that there's a
spoolie this spoolie is awesome but
that's pretty much it it's so goopy on
the brush like so much product is on
this brush you really have to spend your
time cleaning off the brush making sure
there's not too much product because it
can't get gunky personally for me I just
I don't like this whole opaque liquid
gel thing Physicians Formula has
released foundations this is a big deal
I got two shades lw2 which is light warm
- and then ln4 which is like neutral for
and this is called the healthy
foundation it says it has a brightening
complex it has SPF 20 and it's for all
skin types I used this for the first
time earlier today actually filmed a
makeup tutorial this morning and first
of all these colors are too light for me
the ln4 kind of has like a grayish
undertone that I don't love so I
definitely need to go in store and pick
out the right shade because I ordered
these online but I used this earlier
today and I really liked it the only
thing is I was doing kind of like a more
glam look and I felt like I needed more
coverage plus this was too light for me
so I mixed it in with a knife foundation
but when I first applied it on my skin
and I was looking at my skin it does
look really healthy it gives you a
really soft barely-there glow like it's
not a foundation that's trying to be
dewy it's just very natural looking and
it doesn't have much coverage at all I
would say you really have to build this
up to get decent amount of coverage but
I really liked the coverage for like an
everyday foundation look want to try
this out unlike my no makeup makeup days
see how it goes but it is 15 bucks and
I'm not sure if it's worth 15 bucks just
yet okay so this next product I was so
excited about and I ended up like I
don't dislike it but I'm not crazy about
it this is the spot lights illuminating
primer with age-defying actives whatever
that means it's actually a very similar
primer to the new one wild one only this
one is even more pur
more reflective this one is more of like
a natural Sheen this one has shimmer in
it not like glitter but very very fine
shimmer all throughout this liquid and
it does look stunning on the skin it's
really nice to highlight the skin and
give it a nice glow right underneath
your foundation but it's not gonna
hydrate the skin at all I would even say
that the wet and wild one is a little
bit more hydrating than this one this
one just gives you straight-up glow
which is why it's not my favorite but
this might be amazing mixed in with my
favorite moisturizer like this combo
might look beautiful on the skin so I
cannot wait to try it out like that but
on its own underneath my foundation I
don't love it so I'm definitely gonna be
mixing this in with other products maybe
mixing it in with like a dewy foundation
I don't know we shall see all right and
then last but not least I got two of
these and I want to pick up more because
I love it this is the Physicians Formula
healthy lip basically these are liquid
lipsticks it says it has a velvet finish
and I would totally agree when I was
first applying this to my lips I'm
actually wearing this one on my lips
right now this one's called all natural
nude I love this color so much I feel
like I'm gonna use this color all the
time but anyway when I was first
applying this to my lips I was like okay
this is gonna be one of those liquid
lipsticks that are literally just
liquefied lipsticks it's not gonna be
mad it's not gonna dry it down I thought
it was gonna be that type of liquid
lipstick but it's not I mean it is at
first when you start to apply you're
like okay this is pretty liquidy but it
does eventually dry down after a few
minutes and I really really like it it
feels so comfortable it does transfer a
little bit but like clearly seeing
barely any transfer and it just feels so
nice I just I really recommend these I
mean this is the only color I've tried
and I don't know if it lasts all day but
I love how it feels on the lips and the
formula seems to be really really nice
but anyway guys that completes this
video those were the products I just
recently purchased off of the wetter
wild and the Physicians Formula website
let me know if there's some more
drugstore brands you guys want me to try
out any affordable makeup you want me to
