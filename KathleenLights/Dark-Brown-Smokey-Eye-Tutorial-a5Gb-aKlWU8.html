tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing right
now this is the look I was wearing in my
favorite makeup brushes video and it was
highly requested and looks a little
darker today for some reason I guess cuz
my t-shirt is black and I was wearing
very light colors that day summery then
it looks a little darker but it's
literally the exact same look I was
wearing in that video so if you wanted
to see a tutorial on the look I was
wearing in the video then here it is I
am using a bunch of random different
eyeshadows for this look but you can use
whatever similar eyeshadows you have at
home and it'll probably turn out pretty
much the same so really quickly I want
to mention because I know people are
gonna tell me I know this look isn't
like a daytime smokey eye this know this
isn't for everybody this is probably way
too much eye makeup for a lot of people
and like I said on camera for some
reason it looks on love darker than what
it looks like in person but it's not
that serious guys it's just makeup and
sometimes it's fun to be a little bold
and edgy like right now all I'm missing
is my guitar and I've got the look going
on so anyway I just wanted to say that
yeah it's not for everybody but some
people like this look so I try to do
different things for different people so
if you want to see how to get this look
just so the first thing I want to do is
prime my eyelids with Lorax behind the
scenes eye primer and I'm going to take
that all the way up to my brow bone then
I'm going to take the color tattoo in
pomegranate Punk and it's this really
pretty light cranberry purple and I'm
gonna apply this really close to my lash
line
I'm not even going to put this like on
my entire lid or anything
next I'm taking Cork by Mac on a fluffy
blending brush and I'm just going to be
applying this into my crease as my
transition color I'm really not being
specific with this and I'm just laughing
that all over my crease then I'm going
to take a flat shader brush with this
eye shadow called galapagos it's from
NARS you can use any Brown you want and
I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
by the way this look is going to look a
little messy before it looks good it's
one of those looks that you really have
to blend a lot and then it turns out
nice in the end now I'm just taking some
of that cork I used earlier and I'm
going to apply this into my crease with
9217 and I'm just trying to blend these
colors out a little bit more but we will
go back to that and do some more blend
and later on now I'm taking the
Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
Midnight master it's just a nice dark
black and I'm going to tightline with
this and I'm also going to apply this to
my waterline now with my Mac 217 I'm
going to take this color called cocoa
star it's from a Too Faced natural at
night palette but honestly any dark warm
chocolatey color will work for this this
was just my favorite so I'm applying
that into my crease with my 217 and
start blending away like I said this
look requires lots and lots of blending
now I'm taking my gel eyeliner and I'm
gonna start smudging that on my upper
lash line you don't want to be precise
with this at all since we are going to
be like smudging it away pretty much so
you can be sloppy now with a tiny little
brush I'm going to dip it into some
black eye shadow and then I'm going to
use that to help smudge the gel eyeliner
then I'm going to go back in with
Galapagos and then I'm going to apply it
on top just so that the black can blend
into the brown a little bit more it's
kind of like an ombre I don't want it to
be like a black line and then Brown I
want it to fade now I'm going back in to
cork and on my fluffy blending brush I'm
going to start you guessed it blending
at this point you just really really
want to take your time and blend it and
buff it this is the part that takes the
longest just making sure that it looks
kind of like it fades up and it's like a
gradient from dark to a light brown now
I'm just going to apply my mascara to my
top lashes and then finish the rest of
my face so that I can finish the bottom
part of my eyes as my primer i'm using
the maybelline baby skin instant pore
eraser when you have such dark colors on
your eyes you want to make sure that
you're using a full coverage foundation
just so that it could look like it's a
flawless and there's not a lot of
redness because then it'll look like
grungy and weird so I am using the
Maybelline Oh the Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation and I am using this
on a Real Techniques expert face brush
to buff it all out
for underneath my eyes I want something
that's also full coverage since the eyes
are so dark and I am using Mac's Pro
Longwear concealer everything that I'm
using will be in the description box by
the way if you are interested in what
shade or whatever that will be down
below
and then I'm just going to set that with
my MSF natural I need one a little bit
lighter I need to go buy one but yeah
now I'm going to take quark again and
I'm going to use this on a pencil brush
to smudge it underneath my eyes and then
apply my mascara so for the rest of my
face Lee bronzer I'm going to be using
is NARS Laguna and I'm just gonna just
pretty much bronze my whole face I'm not
going to be too precise with this I'm
not going to do like a strong contour or
anything
for my blush I'm using Mac's margin and
it's a really nice like pinky peach
color I'm using this on a duo fiber
brush because it doesn't deposit that
much blush so I don't want something
really strong I just want something to
look like nice and peachy and nice
and then for my lips I am using
Maybelline's blushing beige lipstick and
then that's it that completes this look
for you guys I really hope you enjoyed
it please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
