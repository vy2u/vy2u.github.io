this week I'm adding a random rambles
video because there are a few things I
wanted to tell you guys things I wanted
to update you guys on I wanted to talk
about the new death suspensive and just
certain things I wanted to share with
you guys but I thought they didn't
really fit in within the rest of the
week so today's video is an extra video
will hope you guys don't mind so firstly
the main main reason I'm posting this
video is because that suspensive 26
officially launches to date this is what
it looks like I'm gonna link it down
below I didn't want to do like a
full-blown video on just one nail polish
so I'm gonna be talking to you guys
about it now actually I'm gonna put my
eyebrows on and then I'll be here in a
panic okay now I feel more myself I know
they look really crazy like fat
cockroaches but that's because I don't
have any of the rest of my face makeup
on so it looks a little weird anyway I'm
so excited for this color I'm sorry you
don't let me put my camera down okay so
my lighting is really really awful right
now so excuse the lighting I really just
wanted to talk to you guys about this
color really quick and I'm gonna have
swatches in this video with much better
lighting showing you one coat with this
two coats with this even three coats
with this and I'm also gonna be
comparing that have spent of 26 - deaf
expensive 25 all in today's video plus
we're gonna talk about my hair and my
Invisalign but that's for later okay so
if you guys had no idea last year for my
birthday I launched this bad boy and it
was such a special polish to me it was
gonna be a limited edition shade you
know to celebrate me turning 25 and I
love this polish so much I decided to
name it - suspensive because you guys
know that's like my slogan that's like
that's like my thing you know like
that's pensive I knew you guys would
love the name and I knew it was limited
edition and that I would never be back
but I wanted that name to come back so I
thought it would be a great idea to
launch a limited edition birthday shade
every single year and name it defensive
so the first one was that suspensive but
it does say 25 right here on the bottom
in Roman numerals and now we officially
have a new defensive that suspensive 26
it has 26 in Roman numerals at the
bottom and maybe next year there'll be a
deaf suspensive 27 who knows but I
really wanted to talk to you guys about
the specifics in this video because I
know they look crazy similar in the
bottle but they are completely different
well first
this year's bestest pensive has a rose
gold cap and last year Stan suspensive
has a gold cap you can't really tell
that well in photos when we were taking
pictures of the new one the cap looks
really gold that was hard to tell that
it was a rose gold so last year's that's
expensive it's a full-on opaque glitter
I always recommend using two coats but
it's definitely a polish that you can
get away with just using one coat it's
that opaque and it has almost like a
silver undertone there are gold glitters
but there are silver glitters in this as
well and you have a few rainbow
holographic glitters and this one this
is more of like a birthday topper that
was my idea
with this polish I wanted to something
that was gonna be sheer something that
was gonna look beautiful over so many
different polishes but still give you
that birthday effect which is why I
wanted so many of those rainbow
holographic glitters and this one it's
definitely more on the rainbow side and
more on the sheer side they are totally
different and I use them in completely
different ways I'm actually about to pay
my nails right now with the new one I
love using this on top of other nail
polishes so far my favorite combo is one
coat of one of my spring shades I can't
tell you guys just yet but it's one of
my spring shades one coat of that one
with two coats of this on top is
literally my life I love wearing it like
that but when I was first trying it out
I also really loved it on top of coconut
milk this looks like fairy nails you
have fairy nails it just reminds me of a
birthday polish today I'm actually gonna
I think I'm gonna do like one coat of
Miss Honey and then I'm gonna do two
coats of this and see how that goes I
actually like doing one coat as well
like one coat of coconut milk and then
one coat of this looks beautiful I'm
pouring it on my bare nails a few times
and I love it with two coats it just
gives your nails like a wet glittery
rainbow Li look I love it so much I
really hope you guys enjoy it it is
limited edition once this sells out it
will not come back you guys know based
off of last year's that suspensive I
don't want to be that company that says
things are limited-edition and then they
just keep them around I'm not trying to
fool anybody I was so serious when I
told you guys that once this one sold
out it was gone I mean I know you guys
are so bummed but you know I'm trying to
keep my word here guys
so once that's
spensive 26 sells out it will not come
back at its limited edition for show Z's
but I just want to thank you guys so
much for all the birthday wishes I was
getting the sweetest comments all over
Twitter and on my Instagram on YouTube
but I have to say like before I started
YouTube I mean birthdays were fun
they're out they were amazing I love
birthdays I'm so grateful to have
birthdays but before YouTube
my birthday's were just average you guys
have made my birthday so special with
all the messages you send me all the
love you guys are the frickin nicest
people I've ever met in my life and I
cannot thank you enough so thank you you
guys are the best I'm gonna go ahead and
do my nails in a little bit I'm gonna
talk to you guys about a few other
things so this will be like towards the
end of the video so if you just want to
see that go ahead and fast-forward but
anyway so I just redid my hair you guys
know I had accidentally died my hair
darker when I was trying to just dyed my
hair like one shade darker I ended up
going a little bit too dark and then I
ended up loving it and it just didn't
really stick around for much because the
more I washed my hair the lighter it got
I mean it still wasn't getting as light
as it was before I dyed my hair like
that orangie blonde I had it was just
getting lighter and lighter every time I
washed it and I was kind of missing the
dark hair a little bit I was like whoa I
didn't think I would ever miss that but
I did so got my hair done and basically
what I wanted I just wanted my whole
head to just be a little bit darker kind
of like how it was before but not not
with that green tint I had going on like
when I first dyed my hair there was a
little greenness to it so I wanted a
deeper tone but something that was a
little bit up you know more warm
something that was a little more mean
but not like too warm you know I am the
pickiest person when it comes to my hair
which is why I don't get my hair done
very often I don't really go to salons I
don't really do that because I feel so
awful for the person doing my hair
anybody who has to sit there and listen
to me nitpick everything it's it's
exhausting I'm like I want it a little
bit warm but not too warm but then like
also not too Ashley and I want it just
like that I am seriously a freaking mess
but basically I just wanted my hair to
be a little bit darker and then I wanted
some highlights throughout my entire
head but like in a more balayage style
but I wanted it to be extremely subtle
I'm going to show you
in front of my window like when the sun
is shining you can see it more here I'm
like in the dark
almost but I wanted really really subtle
highlights and it to be barely
noticeable
I wanted people to come up to me and
look at my hair be like oh you have
highlights it couldn't really tell
that's what I wanted I wanted them to be
that natural and I am so grateful for
Jessie who did my hair I'm actually
gonna leave her Instagram down below if
you're in Miami like in the Miramar area
definitely check her out check out her
Instagram she was awesome I literally
drove her insane I was like sitting in
the chair rocking my leg I had so much
anxiety attack freak I have problems and
she was so patient and so sweet she
didn't punch me in the face at all
obviously you can get them less natural
than this but the more I wash my hair
like I said it always happens to me the
more I wash my hair the lighter it gets
so I didn't want the highlights to be
too light since eventually they will get
lighter I'm gonna have yesyes Instagram
down below check her out
I like how she does hair but anyway oh
let me show you by the window okay so
see it looks so natural like if my hair
was naturally highlighted this way and
I'm into it I mean totally happy with
how it turned out I was missing kind of
like the deeper hair at the top it was
an accident I ended up loving by the way
quick question so random I know but I
recently got the new color pop luxe
lipsticks st. look so creamy and
delicious and amazing and I really
wanted to do a whole lip swatch video
but I feel like there's so many people
who have done it already
I don't know if people would even like
watch my video like would that even be
entertaining cuz you've already seen it
from like ten other people let me know
in the comments below because I don't
know if I'm too late you know anyway so
freaking got Invisalign I got so many
questions like why did you get him dis
align your teeth were straight and they
look straight on camera and from far
away I'm I mean my teeth are not like
crooked but since I waited so long to
remove my wisdom teeth like they were
completely out when I removed them they
had pushed my bottom teeth I don't know
if you could tell so that's really the
main issue I had and I know it seems
insignificant cuz like that's your
bottom teeth but whenever I would talk
or see myself talking in videos I've
always stare at my bottom teeth and
these two they're kind of
pushed back and they make my fangs look
even more intense so I'm just trying to
align them and make them all straight
but yeah I don't like this I gotta be
honest I do not like this it's only day
two but I do not freaking like this my
teeth hurt so bad I honestly almost gave
up if it wasn't because I spent so much
money on these damn Invisalign trays I
would have given up I don't do well with
teeth things I don't like things on my
teeth I don't I just uh I honestly just
want to rip my mouth off and right now
it's okay it's because it's already the
next day but every time I remove them I
mean like I said I just got him but when
I would remove them yesterday they felt
so sensitive it was almost like hard to
eat like hard to bite down but that
wasn't the issue the issue is putting
them back in oh my man I don't know if
I'm a wussy but teeth teeth things me
and teeth things I can handle them I
cannot handle them I don't know if I
could do this guys I mean I'm gonna do
it I have no other choice I'm gonna
force myself to do it when I go to film
a video I have to take them off because
I hate this saliva collecting feeling
that I've got going on when I sit here
and talk to you guys so I'm totally
gonna take them off to film talking
videos unless it's like a voiceover
tutorial I'll leave them in but yeah I'm
not gonna be wearing them in my videos
cuz that would literally drive me insane
but anyway a lot of you guys on Twitter
have been telling me that it gets better
as the days go on so that's just that's
just what I'm hoping for
but yeah anyway I'm gonna end this
little random rambles here if this even
was a random rambles video probably not
but I'm gonna end to here but I am gonna
finish off this video with a bunch of
swatches and a bunch of comparisons with
the new desk offensive which is
currently available so check the link
down below but anyway I love you guys I
hope you enjoyed this bonus video today
and it's not sponsored even though it's
on an extra day so double yay for that I
will see you in my next video
hope you enjoy these swatches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
