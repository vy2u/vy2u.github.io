so for today's video I decided to do
kind of like a day to night makeup
tutorial I've actually never done one of
these on my channel before and I find
them really really helpful anyone who
does work throughout the day or goes to
school throughout the day and then it's
going to go out at night and doesn't
have time to go home take off their
makeup put some more makeup on and then
change and then leave this is royal is
for you I'm not saying for you to do
this exact look I'm just going to give
you tips and tricks and what I think
would work best if you want to wear
makeup from morning tonight okay since
this is a day to night makeup tutorial
it doesn't really matter about me doing
my eyes first like I usually do since
when I go touch-up at nighttime I will
already have foundation on regardless so
I'm going to go ahead and do my face
first now I recommend setting your
eyebrows before you go off to work in
the morning because it's going to set
them for the entire day and here I'm
just going to use the prestige brow
builder I already filled in my eyebrows
with Anastasia brow Wiz in brunette and
Mac's quark eyeshadow and I'm just
setting it now okay now I'm going to
take my Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray and I'm going to use this
on my face before anything this is going
to make the foundation stick onto your
face and prolong your foundation so that
it lasts all day I will be applying this
at the end after my foundation and my
eyeshadows and stuff but putting it on
before your foundation as well really
really helps okay so now I'm moving on
to primer this is also going to prolong
the wear of your foundation but it's
also going to make your foundation go on
a lot smoother and nicer and I'm going
to be using my trusty baby skin and I
like to focus this in my t-zone area
because
my skin is a little weird around my
t-zone and my makeup goes on a lot
smoother if I put a primer there and
then pressing it into my pores since it
is a instant pore eraser for foundation
I decided to go with one of my most long
boring foundations and it is the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation it says it
lasts up to 24 hours never tried it up
to 24 hours but it lasts I hike a long
time this is one of the few foundations
I've ever tried that looks better the
longer I wear it
so I'm going to dab just a little bit on
my face and then blend it out with my
Beauty Blender I mean no this is a real
techniques complexion sponge
and I real I really really really really
recommend this foundation for someone
who is looking for a super long wearing
foundation at the drugstore because this
thing lasts forever on my skin so it's
perfect to apply it right before work
and you don't have to touch up your
foundation right before you go out at
night because it still looks for lovest
when I'm self tanning like now you can
see that my skin is just a little bit
warmer than this foundation when I'm not
self-tanning my undertone is a little
bit more yellowy neutral okay so because
I have great skin I don't set my
foundation especially not this one
because it does have more waist satin
matte finish but if you have oily skin I
recommend setting your foundation so
that it lasts even longer I'm going to
go ahead and conceal with some under-eye
concealer and I decided to go with a
concealer that lasts a really long time
on me and it is the LA girl Pro
concealer and it has really good
coverage as well so it's perfect when
you wake up early in the morning and
you've got them dark circles
just blending that out with my Real
Techniques contour brush I'm going to go
ahead and set my under eye concealer and
I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me
powder in 1/35 creamy natural I don't
know why I'm talking with this axe
okay so I'm gonna show my bronzer and
all that other face stuff after my eyes
I have a pimple right here I'm telling
you if Arthur is coming back we're gonna
have some problems probably because I'm
going to Miami and Arthur knows how
stressed I get when I go to Miami okay
so for my eyes first I'm going to prime
them and I'm going to use my Mac
painterly Paint Pot I'm using this
because I feel like it lasts an
incredible an incredibly long time on my
eyelids
and when you want your makeup to last
from day to night you want to use
products that are really going to last
on your face okay the eyeshadows I will
be using are from the lorac pro 2
palette and because this is a
day-to-night look this isn't necessarily
what I would wear like to go to school
or to work depending on where you work I
would guess but if you just want your
makeup to last from day to night I'm
going to go pretty simple for the
daytime and I'm going to dip my brush
into nectar and I'm going to put that in
my crease this is a morphe M b23 love
this brush then I'm going to go into the
color called light brown right there
and on this morphe brush this is an MB
25 I'm going to put that more directly
in my crease
okay then I'm going to go into this
color right here called Chrome and it
looks pretty silvery but it has a lot of
purple undertones to it kind of like Mac
satin taupe and I'm going to stamp this
on my entire lid this is just a Coastal
Scents
I shall brush
I'm going to take that fluffy brush and
just blend out the edges there I'm going
to take this color right here called
buff
it's the yellowy matte color and I'm
going to use this as a highlight right
underneath my brow bone and right in the
inner corners of my eye as well okay so
for underneath my lash line I'm just
going to take light brown on a pencil
brush and run that smudge that
underneath
okay so we are done with the eyes I'm
just curling my lashes with my shoe
Maura schewe eyelash curler aka
perfection now I'm gonna add some
mascara I'm going to use my Urban Decay
perversion mascara okay so I added
mascara to my bottom lashes as well so
this is the eye makeup I think it's very
daytime appropriate so moving on to the
rest of my face I'm going to go ahead
and use some bronzer and the bronzer I'm
using is my happy booster bronzer I mean
no my bronze booster bronzer not happy
booster from Physicians Formula it is a
matte bronzer museum my morphe brush
ever since I got this brush in my
boxycharm is all I've been using
and I'm just bronzing around the
forehead and on my cheekbones not really
focusing on contouring but bronzing in
that area where I would contour
and then that's pretty much good enough
for me and then I'm going to go an extra
little step and add some blush I
recommend using a blush that you know
works really well on your skin in terms
of how long it lasts like a really good
long-lasting blush to me it has always
been this blush from Tarte it is the
Amazonian clay blush in exposed it's
supposed to be like 12 hour blush have I
worn this for 12 hours straight I'm not
exactly sure but I know that this lasts
your really long time I'm using it on my
blush brush from Real Techniques okay
and that's all I'm going to do for my
face in the daytime portion of this
video I'm just going to go ahead and set
my makeup really fast
so it can last all day and then I'm just
going to quickly add some lip gloss and
I'm going for this little lip gloss
right here because it is a duo from bite
and it has a little did I say lip gloss
lipstick did I see the close he has a
little lipstick on this side and then
another little lipstick in a different
shade on this side and this is perfect
for day to night type of looks because
it has like a lighter nude here and then
a little bit of a darker Bobby nude on
this side so depending what mood you're
in at nighttime you can switch up your
lip color and I love it because it's so
tiny really compact and it just fits
right in your purse so I'm going to go
ahead and use this nude and this is in
the shade lychee and then that's it you
can just go ahead and throw this in your
purse and you have your daytime look now
I'm going to show you my little tips and
tricks on how to transform a regular
daytime look into a nighttime look okay
so if you've just gotten out of work or
you've been wearing this makeup all day
and suddenly someone's like hey let's go
to the club get dressed get ready right
now I'm gonna be given five seconds
you're like five seconds what I'm going
to go ahead and use the exact same
palette I'm going to dip it again into
the shade nectar and light brown I'm
going to mix it this time and just go
back into the crease kind of deepen it
up a little bit you're just going to
want to intensify what's already there
then I'm going to go back in with chrome
and just intensify the lid color some
more encase that out the day it did fade
a little bit for whatever reason then on
my Mac 217 right here I'm going to dip
it into the color called plum it's this
really deep really pretty purple and I'm
I start to build this on the outer
corners of my eye and I'm going to drag
it into my crease as well and just
slowly start to build that color a
little by little
until it says deep on the outer corner
as you would like it okay and then I'm
just going to deepen up the lower
lashline with a little bit more of light
brown and now we are pretty much done
and all we did was really deepen out the
outer V of the eye to make it more smoky
and nighttime appropriate now I'm just
going to change up my brow bone
highlight a little bit I'm going to take
this color right here called beige I'm
going to tap it right underneath the
brow bone just to make it a little bit
more like shimmery and doing the same
thing in the inner corners okay so now
I'm going to go ahead and add a little
bit of a winged eyeliner and I'm going
to use my Jessie's Girl waterproof
liquid eyeliner I find that this
eyeliner lasts a really long time so
that's why I'm using it
I'm adding kind of like a half wing I
don't want to bring it all the way in
okay so at this point of the day late
afternoon right before you're going to
go out whatever you have been wearing
your mascara for a really long time so
it's probably not looking as good as it
did when you apply your mascara in the
first place so I recommend using falsies
this is definitely if you're going to go
out at night time and I'm going to be
using my red cherry seven for 7ms and I
find that this really works because I
usually apply my mascara before my
falsies anyway so I will go ahead and
apply those and then be right back okay
so I went ahead and out of the lashes
and added some more mascara to my bottom
lashes just to make it just that more
dramatic okay so for my face since I
already have my face makeup on I'm just
going to make it just a little bit more
nighttime appropriate I'm going to take
my same bronzer and on this little brush
right here I'm starting to love this
brush it's from morphe and it's the m-43
six and I'm going to dip the side in and
actually contour with this just to
define my face a little bit more since
since the nighttime okay and I already
have blush on so I'm not going to add
any more blush but now I'm going to add
to my highlight to my face because I
didn't do that earlier I'm going to take
my Physicians Formula shimmer strip and
Miami strip Holy Grail product and I'm
going to wipe my morphe brush on a towel
to get the bronzer off and I'm going to
use this to highlight just focus it on
the lighter shades here and boom
okay I'm pretty much done with makeup
now I'm just going to add a little bit
more of that lipstick I added earlier
lychee from bite Beauty and then I'm
going to add a gloss on top and I'm
going to use my buxom gloss in White
Russian because this lasts a heck of a
long time only okay guys so that
completes this look I hope you enjoyed
this day to night time makeup tutorial
these are just the things that I would
do if I already had makeup on from
earlier that day just to intensify it
and make it nighttime appropriate so I
