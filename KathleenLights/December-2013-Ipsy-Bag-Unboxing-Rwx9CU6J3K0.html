face okay well not by your face I do
have a little bit of mascara I filled in
my brows and a little bit of concealer
and some powder on the top so it's not
barefaced
but this is yet again another unplanned
hypsi bag unboxing I feel like my Ipsy
bag surprises me every month sometimes I
get a like on the 15th sometimes I'll
get on the 10th it's just it's weird so
I never really know when I'm gonna get
it because for some reason it never lets
me track my order anyway really quickly
a lot of you guys have been asking why I
am constantly having my hair in a bun
now and it's because I have put my hair
through so much in the past two months
I've used a lot of bleach on my hair and
that will take a massive toll on your
hair so I've been wearing it up in a bun
a lot recently I'm just trying to give
my hair a break and you know treating it
a lot of hair masks and not any heat at
least I'm trying not to put any heat on
it so that's why my hair is always in a
bun now that will change I will not have
my hair in a bun in every single video
for the rest of my life but for right
now I'm just trying to put a little heat
as possible and if my button bothers you
guys I'm sorry I'm sorry anyway for
those of you who are not affected by my
bun let's get into the Ipsy bag video
so I asked you guys now it comes with
this little card that tells the theme of
the bag celebration is the theme and you
know I don't read these corny I just
don't need that and this is what the bag
looks like oh man it's like stuffed the
bag is actually now that I'm feeling it
the bag is actually pretty sturdy it
seems like really good material you know
how sometimes the bags feel a little bit
cheapy this one actually feels like it's
really good material nice and sturdy I
like it so the first thing I see in this
bag is this nail polish by Nick knack
I've never heard of this brand but this
bottle is so cute oh my god it seems
like so luxurious like doesn't it seem
expensive I got mine in the color mine
is in the color ripe apple I couldn't
find the name on the bottle so I had to
check on the Ipsy website but yeah this
one's called ripe Apple it has like a
classic brush and it seems like it would
be pretty opaque find out I've been that
this video if it is or not this is
obviously a full-size nail polish and
they cost $4.99 the next thing in the
bag is this pop Beauty eyes shadow trio
I haven't used any of the pop beauty
makeup products but I have heard of them
I got mine in smokin hot let's just open
this oh boy oh my god mine is like not
opening up great and it's a cute little
trio it comes with these little sponge
tips that I don't really use but it
comes with like a dark grayish black a
silver and a shimmery white color I
really wanted the you Brown trio you
either got this one or the brown ones I
I wear a lot of Browns I'll just quickly
swatch them for you so that's the dark
color that's the great
and that's the shimmery white I'd say
it's pretty decent oh great why did I
close it I couldn't find the price of
this trio when I went on the pop Beauty
website they only had like the ten pan
palette and that was 24 I don't I
couldn't find the three pan trio so I'm
not sure how much this is next thing in
the bag is this signature by English
laundry - a little mangled and they are
just two perfume samples this one is
like half empty not half empty obviously
but it's pretty empty I feel like I
heard that a lot of people got there's
like half empty this one is a little bit
low but this one is for men and this one
is for women let me smell the woman one
Oh spray it on myself
oh this one smells good this one it
smells pretty good I picture like my mom
wearing this I don't really like sense
like that I can't describe since I'm
very bad but this smells like something
my dad would wear so yeah these aren't
bad they smell good they're just not
something I would really wear I can't
really tell you how much these are
because they are little samples like
that but this brand is pretty expensive
so the next thing in the bag is this be
a bombshell the one stick everybody got
this in their bag I'm pretty sure
everybody just got different colors and
they have given us via bombshell
multiple times in our FC bag and I
actually really like this brand so let's
see what I got the color I got is called
flustered oh my god this is big for some
reason when I saw it online I thought it
was like a tiny little steak this is
huge this looks like a NARS multiple is
that how big an R
boys so this is the color I got it's
like a cherry red with a little bit of
pink I would say let me swatch it that's
a huge swatch excuse me
but it doesn't slide on very smoothly
this is the color I got it is a really
pretty pinky red on the website it says
it's supposed to be an all-in-one
multiple stick with a smooth texture
applied to eyelids cheeks or lips for
the perfect pop of color can't say that
I would wear this on my that's
personally but definitely as a lip and
cheek stain I think that this would work
pretty well and this bad boy is
full-size and it is $16 which is more
than you paid for your up C bag and
lastly in the bag
is the thing that I was most excited
about when I signed my glam room I was
like yes I wanted that and it is a NYX
lipstick and all this color is beautiful
I got mine in the color sky pink and it
just seems like a nice pretty like muted
midtone pink it looks really pretty so
it actually goes on pretty sheer but it
has like a nice glossy finish to it I
think I'm really gonna like this this is
just like of my alley
these NYX lipsticks retail for $4 and I
think it's really awesome that they
started including NYX in their bags
because a lot of people can't get their
hands on them because it's like only at
Ulta now it's at Target but it's not at
my target of course so yeah that is
everything I got in my Ipsy bag by the
way the inside is red how cute is that
anyway I'm actually pretty pleased with
it I think the lipstick is beautiful
this is like a really cool product and
everybody can use some red nail polish
you're not always gonna love everything
you get obviously but I think that if C
is a really really good subscription
service probably one of the best out of
all of the $10 ones in my opinion so
yeah if you want to see me kind of
testing out these products just a I'm
going to test out the
nail polish I have a worn nail polish in
two weeks and why not why not why not do
little swatches swatch for the folks oh
my god sorry I'm like painting my nail
and it is so okay guys this is one coat
look at this my nails are really short
and gross but this is literally one coat
I liked it was sweet my brush and it is
a very intense it's a beautiful red so a
plus plus for me hopefully it just
doesn't check fast
let's see how this would work as a
lipstick don't eat it guys this doesn't
taste good okay so I recommend putting
this on with a lip brush it's pretty
sheer but I think it is nice for like a
nice little wash of color on your lips I
think it is pretty it does have aspects
of glitter keep that in mind if you
don't like glitter like it has little
tiny micro glitters it does blend really
nicely on your cheeks if you're one of
those people who likes like that whole
rosy blushing like if you were blushing
for real kind of look then I think this
is the product for you it does blend out
nicely and the glitters kind of just
roll away I'm gonna go ahead and try on
the NYX lipstick it is a little bit more
frosty then I would like I don't know if
you can tell but it is really really
pretty the frosting just kind of makes
my lips look a little bit glossy I think
this would look really nice paired with
like a little simple smokey eye or
something or like a intense smoky eye
they're actually pretty pigmented if you
put some primer underneath when i
swatched them on my hands
I didn't have any primers so I was
watching like chalky by the way this is
what I'm trying out right now in case
you're confused okay so this is the
quick little look I came up with using
this trio I mean I did it really quickly
so it looks kind of wonky it doesn't
look really good but these eyeshadows
are pretty pigmented these two in
particular the only one that pretty much
sucks is this one it's just straight-up
glitter when you put it on your face so
I didn't like this one but these two are
actually pretty good so hey guys so
that's the end of this video let me know
down below what you got in your empty
bag this month and I hope you enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
