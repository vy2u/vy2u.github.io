my Buxton Sherman Buxton and I'm doing
this new thing now where I'm just gonna
let my hair be curly until 2016 and I
know that 2016 is like tomorrow not
ready but you know it's like five
minutes away but I never leave my hair
curly for like more than five days
because after like the five day mark I'm
like oh I want my straight hair again
cuz this is my hair naturally I mean of
course I have things to maintain the
frizz you know like some curling cream
and stuff cause up not this would look
like Mufasa but I just I don't know I
don't like my natural hair I changed
this a little bit because it was very
Halloweeny before so I got this like a
faux fur thing wreath at Target and I
also got this little Christmas tree at
Target and then this is a bath and
Bodyworks Ken just in case anybody was
wondering all right so let's crack open
this month's box okay so this is what
the box looks like this month and this
month's theme is like Great Gatsby it's
like the Roaring Twenties kind of theme
it says pop fizz and clink and I'm just
gonna dive right in so the first thing I
see is this giant thing right here and
this says it's the Nelson J Beverly
Hills Moisture healing mask this is a
100% argan oil derived moisturizing
treatment and it says it's most
effective for color-treated dry or
damaged hair and it has a coconut scent
yes yes yes to all of that I have color
treated and very dry damaged hair and I
love anything that's coconut scented so
let's open this oh that get oh my nose
this smells so good this smells
identical to Hawaiian gold is that what
that sunscreen is called Hawaiian
Australian gold Australian gold that's
not what the little koala on it right I
don't know it smells really good it
smells just like sunscreen but like the
good kind and you can use this any way
you want you can use it for five minutes
or you can use it for one minute it's
just like
a hair mask that you rinse off so I'm
really really excited to use this I love
hair masks so much this is a full-size
hair mask and it is $23 so the next
thing in the Box is this little guy
right here and this is a bellapierre
cosmetics gel lip liner in the shade
cinnamon what I have a feeling that this
color is beautiful just by the name well
I mean there's a color thing here I've
gotten bellapierre products in the past
and this looks like it's gonna be a
fabulous color
oh so the color on this looks nothing
like the color on this but let's watch
it anyway okay for some reason I thought
this was gonna be a wooden lip liner
which you guys know is not my favorite I
like these kinds of liners because they
are a little bit creamier oh this color
is so so beautiful it definitely is a
brown but it has a lot of warmth in it
I'm guessing that's why it's called
cinnamon it is beautiful I love warm
shades you guys know so I'm really
excited I have feeling I'm really really
gonna get some use out of this this is a
full-size lip liner of course and this
retails for $17.99
okay so the next thing in the box I'm
really excited for because I heard that
they were going to be including this in
this month's boxycharm so I'm very
excited and this is an Oprah long
lasting liquid lipstick you guys know I
feel about the over liquid lipsticks and
this one is in the shade americano this
is probably one of my favorite oh for
liquid lipsticks it really really is
amazing and this would pair so well with
the lip liner they included in this
month so thank you buck the charm I see
what you did there
this is full-size of course and these
retail for 1990 Oh write it in let's
keep on going there are six products in
this month's box usually they have five
but this month they have six which is
pretty freakin awesome so the next thing
in the Box is from a brand called NC la
Los Angeles and I really love their nail
polishes
and this month they included their so
rich vitamin E enriched cuticle oil for
a second I thought it was a nail polish
but no it's a cuticle oil which I'm very
excited I really like this brand so I'm
excited to try this cuticle oil I've
never tried it before
and this is obviously a full-size
product and this retails for $18 all
right two more things in this month's
box one of them is this guy right here
and this is the jelly pom-pom cosmetics
all over glow Luminizer gel and I have a
feeling I got this I think so I think
I've gotten this in an Ipsy bag before
like very very recently a couple months
ago but I know that it wasn't a
full-sized product I did get like a
sample in one of my FC bags and I'm all
about the highlight I love luminous
glowy skin but I wish that they would
put like a powder highlight in the box
you know not a liquid this one has like
a very moosie consistency it's not super
super liquidy and honestly I haven't
even played around with the one that I
got in my Ipsy bag I haven't even been
able to test how many products since I
am in the process of moving but that
being said this is a full set this
smells really really good
this is a full-sized product and this
retails for 1595 okay and then the last
product in the box and I think this is
like their bonus item I'm very excited
for it even though even though I'm not
oily I don't have oily skin but this is
the tatcha petal fresh original abura
okay I'm gonna try say this word Abu rot
origami I'm not sure I think these are
blotting sheets yes
made of 100% natural ibaka leaves and
gold flake to absorb excess oil without
disturbing makeup for petal fresh skin
now I don't have oily skin so I rarely
like I've never really blotted I have
very dry skin but this could be useful I
mean sometimes sometimes in the
I got a little dewy her than usual this
is what they look like and they actually
have like little gold flecks in this
paper tatcha is a super super luxurious
very expensive brand but I love the
brand I literally love this brand so I'm
very very very very happy put this in
the box considering it's so pricey this
is full size like this you can buy this
like this and this retails for $12 okay
guys so that was everything I got in
this month of bug serum the overall
value of this month's box was over $100
which is amazing considering you only
pay $21 a month I will leave the Box
turn website down below if in case you
want to sign up this is my favorite
subscriptions subscription a
subscription service not because I send
it to me because they do but not because
they send it to me because it's the best
it literally is the best you get
full-size products all the time and yeah
sometimes you don't like the things that
you get in the box and they suck or
they're not so great and you give them
to a friend but you pay $21 and the
value is so high so I highly highly
recommend boxycharm if you're getting
into makeup or if you want to get this
as a gift for someone this is a great
gift this is just a great subscription
service and you get like a present once
a month on your doorstep it's fun I
really love it so that completes this
video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
