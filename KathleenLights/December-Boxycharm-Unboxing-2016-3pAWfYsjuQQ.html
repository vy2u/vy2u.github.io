Matt box you zoom back sit I'm still
sick but I'm feeling much better
haven't really been able to sit down and
film because I've had like a really
nasty cold couldn't get through like
three sentences without sneezing but I'm
feeling better this morning we're here
now I just scared my dogs they were
asleep and we're gonna open this box
that I've already opened and we're gonna
try out the products that are inside
it's gonna be a great time grand ol time
I know you're probably thinking wow
another day without a makeup collection
where is your makeup collection and I
know I'm literally the world's worst
youtuber you could just call me that but
tomorrow morning I will film that oh you
better believe it I will film my makeup
collection tomorrow and that should be
up on Wednesday so keep your eyes peeled
should be up on Wednesday so yeah
today's the first time I rushed my hair
in like four days literally and yeah
let's get started so this is what the
box looks like this one the theme is
makeup on point it's like a ballerina
themed box nice and then you also get
this thing in the box which is a coupon
maybe wait no oh yes oh I haven't even
looked at this it's a gift card to try
out one of those like snack boxes but
this is like a full-blown like meal you
can get a classic box a veggie box or a
family box it's from the brand
hellofresh
and the coupon I do not try me weather
okay and it's raining but I gotta get
through this and the gift card is for
$40 off which is an incredible amount
like how much is this normally I might
go ahead and use this because that
veggie box looks very appealing
it's actually pretty awesome that they
included that in the box this month so
the first thing in the box is an
eyeshadow palette I haven't opened it or
anything I just read that it says pur
cosmetics buff collection eyeshadow
collection it denied shadow palette this
is from the brand of pure cosmetics but
not the pure you're probably thinking
about this one is spelled like the word
pure the other one is like PU are anyway
ah oh okay
this is okay I see which is it their
beer so I'm assuming this is one of
those more affordable brands that try to
you know mimic or dupe the urban decay
get palette this is definitely a dupe
for or at least an attempt to dupe the
Urban Decay Naked 3 oh my gosh this
palette is $50
that's suspensive you might as well just
get the Naked 3 I think the Naked 3 is
like 50 - you better be really goo
I'm just watching some on the back of my
hand they feel very very very soft
they're very pigmented oh my gosh
they're like super powdery when you
touch them like those very soft powders
here are a few colors swatched they are
very soft but they are very pigmented at
the same time so let's try them on the
eyes it even comes with a brush just
like the naked 3 does I'm gonna take
this mouth shade called clay and I'm
gonna use that in my crease
so I was recently if you follow me on
social media I was recently in Las Vegas
oh my gosh there's one of those funhouse
mirrors and the weather was so dry and
cold in Vegas definitely in comparison
to Miami and Miami it's super humid and
super hot so my skin reacted so crazy to
Vegas weather oh my gosh my skin is
drier than it's ever been in its entire
life just imagine that just imagine that
today I was putting on I didn't even put
on foundation today because my skin is
so dry so all I did was put on concealer
and my face is like cakey if you look
really up close it's like mmm
I even have very dry patches all over my
arms and my hands gonna have to drench
my face in oil
I even got like there and the winburn on
my lips I bet some of you are looking at
me like cold in Vegas really it's cold
for me every time I do looks in my box
you turn videos they're not like
tutorials they're not specific looks
they're not anything out of this world
I'm just trying to see the blend ability
of the eyeshadows and the pigmentation
to give you guys my thoughts on that I'm
going to take this shade right here
called Canyon and I'm going to put that
all over my lid okay so definitely a lot
of fallout with this eye shadow I think
the shimmery shades are going to give
you way more fallout ah because they're
so soft so much gets pick
onto the brush a lot of it falls off so
you might want to tap your brush I'm not
extremely impressed with this shimmer
shade I'm going to take a little bit of
sandstone I'm going to go right on top
of it this is definitely one of those
eyeshadow palettes you're gonna need mac
fix+ or eyedrops or like a mixing medium
one of those things to really get the
eye shadows the shimmer shades to be as
pigmented as possible because not super
impressed with the shimmer shades at
least the two that I tried I'm gonna
take quartz on my brow bone I'm going to
take this shimmery shade Sahara and I'm
gonna put this in my inner corners yeah
the shimmery shades are not very good
I'm going to take Mirage right here on
the lap the last color and I'm just
gonna buff that on the outer corners a
little bit this color looks really
pretty in the pan but as you're blending
it it's more like charcoal than anything
else I'm going to go back into the first
shade we used clay and I'm going to run
this on my lower lash line okay so now
I'm gonna put on mascara and I will be
right back
okay so my overall conclusion on this is
that it's 100% not worth the $50 tes
spensive does not worth $50 it
definitely isn't the worst palette I've
ever used I will say that I have used
other palettes that were difficult to
blend these were not difficult to blend
they weren't exactly difficult to work
with but they're way too soft the matte
shades aren't right with the shimmer
shades are just not doing it for me they
just go on kind of like a wash I mean I
like the look it gave me it was a very
natural everyday look but in my opinion
that's really the only thing you can get
out of this unless you're using like
fix+
so not the biggest fan of this I have to
be honest at least you didn't pay the
$50 for it right I mean okay moving on
the next thing in the Box just is this
is the makeup geek full spectrum
eyeliner pencil this is in the shade
spice I believe I already have this let
me check yes I do
he's right here okay so I put the
eyeliner back in the box cuz I could
give this one to someone since I already
have it but funny thing is that I
haven't
she tried this color I have tried to
makeup geek eyeliners before but not
this specific color and I don't know
what it's such a pretty like cool tone
Brown these eyeliners are really nice
they're very creamy they're very smooth
if you're someone who has super watery
water lines I don't know if you would
like this because it's not waterproof
but they're awesome - like really smudge
out they're very very creamy so I'm just
gonna apply some of this I completely
forgot
that this was in the box I shouldn't
have put on mascara yet but I'm just
gonna pop some of this on my waterline
and then blend it out nice nice I like
that color okay so I actually really
really like this color I've never tried
it before I like that they added this
color because it's still wearable it's
not a blue or a green but it's not your
typical brown it's more cool toned I
really really like it it's almost like a
gray Brown this is obviously full size
and it retails for nine dollars
next thing in the back is this guy right
here haven't opened it yet but I know
what's the nail polish cuz I can see if
it'll bubble right so we get a butter
LONDON nail polish in the box this month
which i think is amazing because these
nail polishes are like $15 three right
yes $15 so it's nice cuz it's like a
most the price of the box and actually
really really love this color it's such
a beautiful wine it's called Ruby Marais
Ruby Marie marri marri marri Ruby Mari I
hear that butter LONDON actually updated
their formula and that it's really
really good so I'm so excited to paint
my nails with this I love these like
super dark vampy wine colors for the
winter its I love it I love it so
excited for that okay so next up is this
little box this is the beauty for real
lip revival exfoliating and hydrating
lip scrub nice I have a lip balm on
right now but we are going to try this
puppy this product is full-size and it
retails for $14 so let's try this nice
and scrubby nice
scrubbie oh that's a lot okay okay
well actually doesn't taste bad doesn't
taste mad at all what is this made of
this tastes familiar that exfoliated my
lips pretty nicely I mean most lip
exfoliator zoo that's what they're meant
for but this one has very very tiny
little scrubbies it almost feels like a
microdermabrasion lip scrub if that
makes sense they're very very small
actually like scrubby's like this more
than the ones that are very oily or
nourishing and then don't have that much
exfoliation to it because i didn't dry
out my lips but it's not my lips aren't
like oily or greasy okay it says raw
sugarcane exfoliates your lips while
orange vanilla and cinnamon that's what
it is
how did I not get that and cinnamon bark
essential oils hydrate and condition for
the softest smoothest kissable lips I
actually like this scrub a lot I'm not
super impressed by many scrubs they all
do the same thing but I really really
like this one okay then the last thing
in the Box is this little guy right here
this is the ofra long lasting liquid
lipstick in the shade of a li it's like
a metallic purple I actually have this
already let me grab mine this is mine
I'm gonna put this one back in the box
as I told you guys like a hundred times
I've kind of been in like a makeup funk
so I haven't even tried this out either
I've tried out Tuscany this is part of
their like new collection by the way
Ofra came out with like some winter
colours Tuscany is like the best thing
that ever happened to me I love that
liquid lipsticks so much that I haven't
even been able to try the other ones so
let me pop on some Napa Valley I'm
afraid I'm gonna be I don't know how I'm
gonna feel about this
okay so this is the color I'm not sure
how I feel about it I think it's really
cool but I'm not dressed for this lip do
you know what I meet with like really
simple eyes are actually really vampy
eyes and like a really dark cool outfit
I think this lip color would be so cool
because it's an intense purple but it's
not like a super fluorescent purple yeah
it's still metallic I think it's a
pretty cool liquid lipstick it's not the
most wearable if you have a very deep
skin I think you might like this if you
like color if you like kind of something
different maybe not for me but I think
it's pretty cool
okay guys so that was everything that
was in the box this month I did the math
on the overall value for the box this
month was 107 dollars which is pretty
amazing boxycharm now shifts to Canada
so that is cool I really really like the
lip screw surprisingly didn't think it
was gonna be my favorite but I was super
impressed by this lip scrub I love all
four liquid lipsticks they're probably
my favorite liquid lipsticks of all time
and you can't go wrong with a butter
LONDON nail polish so I'm really
impressed by these oh and I really like
this makeup geek eyeliner I'm just not
into this eyeshadow palette I gotta be
honest the rest of the box really good
this was kind of a dud for me personally
