my bucks Sherman boxes
I felt so bad last night I don't want to
give in to detail but I had a really bad
stomach ache last night and this morning
and I woke up like oh my gosh I'm not
gonna be able to film today but luckily
I started feeling a little bit better
and I was like dr. Phil so I'm still in
my bottle Akasa
because that's what I've been wearing
all day which is like this giant this
goes all the way down to the floor guys
I wear weird things sometimes try to say
that five times fast
I wear weird things sometimes it's a
tongue twister if I see him a little mom
today it's cuz I feel like I might be
getting sick I don't know I get really
nervous when the weather changes like it
has in Miami and it's been really cool
for Miamians of course but it's been
really cool and I'm afraid I'm getting
sick but anyway let's get into this
month's box you already know how these
videos go I like to try these products
on my face as I go and all I have on my
face right now is a little bit of
Smashbox camera ready BB water and my
brows so this is the bulks this month
and the theme is glitz and glam I often
feel like my lips are incredibly dry and
let's just dive into the first product
right here and it is from bellapierre
cosmetics and it is the pro concealer
palette I haven't opens it I don't know
what it looks like on the inside but I
am a little bit nervous because my skin
is a bit dry and these types of products
tend to be a little bit drying on the
skin but I'm gonna give it a chance this
is the pro concealer palette it is a
full-size product and it is $29.99 it
says it has rich and creamy good for
your skin ingredients which help create
a flawless healthy complexion we shall -
oh well then I did not expect that Oh am
i dumb or something I think so because
this clearly says Belle appears
professional color correcting concealer
palette does it say that on the front
Pro concealer palette okay it does say
correcting concealer on here but it
doesn't on this which is why I got
confused I thought I was gonna open like
a concealer palette with like flesh
toned concealers but no we've got this
now I regret putting my BB cream on
because I could have used
that's okay we can try to use this
orange EPG one underneath the eyes I
wish they would have given like a little
description letting you know what orange
is for or what green is for what purple
is for but that's what I'm here for so
purple is usually for like brightening
your skin kind of corrects like
sallowness and it just helps to brighten
the complexion green is used to combat
redness if I ever use a color correcting
concealer which if I'm gonna be honest
with you I never really do but if I do I
usually use the green peachy colors like
this like orange shades are really good
to combat dark circles they really mask
the darkness underneath the eyes I think
it might be a little too dark for me but
I think was a light hand
okay so typically I wouldn't use a color
so orange and so deep I'll go for
something a little bit more peach and
pinky for underneath the eyes and that
usually really helps with my darkness
but I'm going with it I'm actually going
to take a little bit of the green and
I'm gonna play some of that right in
between my brows cuz I have like a red
birthmark there I look like a zombie
speaking of zombies I'm not gonna spoil
anything I promise I promise I promise
and please do not spoil anything in the
comments for the rest of us but did you
see the mid-season finale of The Walking
Dead did you see that um I was not happy
about that I've got to say I was not not
happy about that episode but I'm trying
to cope with it I'm trying go I'm gonna
take my tart shape tape concealer and
I'm gonna go over that other concealer
with this
okay so I have placed some powder and
bronze our off-camera and they look
pretty normal I wouldn't say they look
any worse and I also wouldn't say they
look any better I think my undereyes
look exactly the same
I smell super weird by the way this
smells like crayons like literally this
smells exactly like a box of crayons
maybe this is your thing if you're into
color correctors but I'm just not so
this is kind of like an amp credit from
me okay next up we have this big old
white box this is from the brand real
her and this is their blush kit it is
full-size it is $32 let's let's see this
blush kit oh okay okay okay
it's like that and then the mmm this is
what the blushes look like I really
really like this I mean this one is
looking really glittery so that one's
making me a little bit nervous but these
two look really beautiful this one is
also just a tiny bit literary but not
not that much of course we would have to
see how it looks on the face but you can
see there there swatched and the
swatches are a bit lighter than they
look in the pan I'm gonna be mixing
unstoppable and limitless today Oh
actually I might use this brush this is
the next thing in the box that I'm gonna
use for my blush I think wait what kind
of brush is this this is from crown
brushes this is their deluxe
blush brush oh yeah it's for what I
would normally put on my blush with a
brush like this I would put my
foundation on with a brush like this
actually oh or like cream contour mmm
this is calling my name for cream
contour actually I'm gonna play a little
bit more with this guy first
reason I like it I can like this brush I
think there's a little bit too dense for
blush but we're gonna try it I'm just
gonna dip into both of these I thought
this brush was gonna be too dense but
because the blushes aren't super
pigmented it works this brush isn't
isn't my favorite for blush but I'll
tell you something I'll definitely be
using this brush for something else
because it is incredibly soft and I just
I really like it and also I really like
this blush
I like this blush combination I prefer a
natural softer look and this definitely
gives it to you the first shade fearless
isn't my cup of tea because of all the
glitter but the other two are really
really pretty so the next thing in the
box I mean we're already here we might
as well say this zoomed in the next
product is from Tarte and as the Tarte
tardes mascara I actually have this and
I know I've used this in the past I just
don't remember what I felt about it this
is the lash paint mascara and it is a
full-size product and it's $23 and you
already know let's try this sucker out
all right so I really like this mascara
I think gave me a lot of volume I will
say though if you apply too much of this
it can get clumpy so I would definitely
not apply too much but you could just
easily brush it out with a spoolie and
you'd be fine but yeah I really like
that mascara okay Emily lastly in the
box is this guy this is a liquid
lipstick from the brand pretty vulgar I
actually tried out this product on my
channel when I was testing out pretty
vulgar I didn't test out this color I
just that out another one but I have
tried out this formula before and this
color is beautiful by the way I'm not
really into the metallic lips anymore I
think they're beautiful for photos and
like for aesthetics and art but for
day-to-day I'm not really too into them
except maybe during the holidays
actually yes during this time of year I
do think a metallic lip is pretty like a
red metallic lip is pretty and a bronze
wound as well so this is the shade
weeping willow oh and this is a
full-size product that retails for $24
dries with a creamy texture which it
does this isn't like a very matte liquid
lipstick this is more like a creamy
lipstick that's liquefied that's crema
fide
well I actually really really like this
color I liked it in the tube but I liked
it a lot more on the lips I do think it
looks a little crazy you know they're
metallic but I think it looks so festive
and fun and I think this would look
really nice Ike in the center of your
lips I give it a pop I think this would
be beautiful for that it feels very
comfortable on the lips as well I take
back what I said about metallic lips
earlier so pretty okay guys so that was
everything I got in this month's
boxycharm I would say these standout
products to me are the brush and the
tart mascara oh and actually I really
really liked the lip product as well
these three those three products are
definitely my favorite but the real her
blush kit and diba appear concealer
palette I'm like and about and I have
like other boxes a little bit more in
the past but I still think it's a great
box especially for the money actually
did the math and the overall value of
the box this month is over 120 dollars
so yeah back in wait this video guys let
me know what you got in your box this
month let me know if you liked it did
