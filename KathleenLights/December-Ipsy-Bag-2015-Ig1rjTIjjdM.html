my Ipsy bag and bagging I always say I'm
boxing but does that really make sense
no I just filmed my boxycharm unboxing
which that video should be up before
this in case you're wondering like
you're wearing the same stuff yeah I
totally like just film that like right
now and since I both got them in the
mail the same day I decided to just film
them both today since I have time to
film and you guys know these days it's
it's hard for me to film so no one's
home today so without further ado I'm
just gonna crack this bad boy open so
this is what the bag looks like this one
for some reason I think of like
old-school like very vintage kind of
like won't my grandmother not in a bad
way but like well my grandmother what
keep your makeup in the car and it says
with love from Ipsy and it has like
cartoons of like all the Ipsy girls and
stuff so yes as you guys know if she
doesn't include like a little card with
a description of everything so I will
leave everything down below that I get
in this month's bag with it's full size
price next to it and all that good stuff
I will leave all the info down below so
let's just jump right in so this guy
jumped out at me right now and I'm very
very excited I don't know what color
this is but I'm excited already this is
the formula X nail color this is
definitely a sample size like this is
not a full-size nail polish but how
often do you go through a nail polish
not very often right Wow almost fell oh
I love it oh I have it I actually
already have this nail polish it's
called revved up I have worn it in a
video like a while ago I think about
this last year during the holidays but
it's a beautiful beautiful rose gold I
love the formula of this polish
specifically I love love love this color
so I'm gonna put this back in and like
give it to my friend alright moving
right along next product is this guy
right here this is the power of love
natural lipstick 100% vegan from the
brand Pacifica you can find Pacifica at
Target they actually have really nice -
like moisturizers and stuff like me so
this is a
I've never tried like pacifica makeup I
don't think this looks like it's a
full-size lipstick actually I'm pretty
I'm 100% positive this is a full-size
product ooh I like this color a lot this
is a really pretty everyday shade nice
natural brownish pinky mauve shade don't
know how to explain it but it is
gorgeous and it seems to be like very
very moisturizing all right let's keep
it moving so this next product right
here is from a brand called Peter Peter
llamas and it is their spa Central's
intensive repair hand cream for all skin
types and I need to go on the Ipsy
website because I am so over getting
hand creams in my Ipsy bag I feel like I
don't get them every single month but I
feel like I'm always getting hand creams
and I know I can do like the online quiz
or like write this product so that they
don't give me hand cream anymore but I'm
just I need to do that I'm gonna do that
as soon as I'm done filming this video
because I'm like so over the hand cream
which I'm sure this is a great hand
cream but I mean I have like 70 I'm just
gonna pass this along to my mom but for
people who like hand cream I mean this
is good oh righty then let's keep it
moving two more products in the bag I
feel like this video is going by so fast
so this is from a brand called model CO
and I've got in Monaco in epsy before
I'm pretty sure and this is the illusion
lip liner in the shade I don't think it
has a shade nope no shade name let's
just open this oh this is a really
pretty color for some reason I thought
it was gonna be the color of this cuz I
mean doesn't that make sense but no it's
like a really pretty
everyday brownish mauve shade this would
also look really pretty underneath that
Pacifica lipstick so I am excited about
this lip liner because it's not a wooden
lip liner which I love these kinds of
creamy textures it does feel really
creamy on my hand so the last product is
this guy right here and this is from the
brand Kota Lee which is a very very
pricey brand sold at Sephora I don't own
anything by Kohli but I'm very excited
this is there s
os thirst-quenching serum says you apply
morning and evening to face a neck
before your moisturizer for some reason
I want to smell it
ah that just farted right onto my hand
it has like a nice and milky consistency
I really like the consistency and it
doesn't have a scent which I really love
I'm really excited to use this I am
actually gonna use this tonight because
I've always wanted to try code Elite
products so I'm very very excited for
this okay guys so that was everything I
got in this month's epsy bag I actually
really really like this bag because the
lip liner was great that nail polish is
amazing getting something from Kota Lee
is really really exciting and that
lipstick looked like a really nice color
so I have nothing bad to say about this
month's bag except for the hand cream
I'm like so over the hand cream but I
don't think it's AB C's fault I think
it's my fault for not like doing the
online quiz so yeah that completes this
video leave me a comment down below what
you got in your FC bag this month
whether you like this month whether you
hated it let me know let's chat about it
thank you guys so much for watching
