hey guys so today's video is a quick one
I'm doing a makeup tutorial on vite why
I'm out of breath
on the eye look I'm wearing I didn't
record myself doing my foundation and my
concealer and my powder because I feel
like I do that in every video and it's
always the same thing
so I skip that I just did my bronzer my
blush my highlight and my lips just to
save a little bit more time I wanted to
mainly focus this look around these eyes
so that's what I'm doing today I really
hope you enjoyed this video and that you
really liked this I make up I really do
I think it's a nice end and a smoky and
a sexy I like it very much so you want
to see how to get this eye look then
just keep watching
so as usual the first thing I'm doing is
priming my eyes this is the LA girl Pro
conceal I really love using this
concealer to prime my eyelids because it
stays in place all day and it doesn't
crease on me so that's what I'm using
this is the Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral
palette I know I'm like beating this
palette to death and I've used it in
like all of my recent tutorials but it's
really good I'm taking this cream color
shade it's really close to my skin tone
and I'm using this to put all over my
eye up to my brow bone to set that
concealer and I'm going to take this
really warm reddish kind of brown
there's a lot of red to this oh what I
don't know okay and I am using this as
my transition shade this shade is really
important for the other shadows we were
putting down and it does take a little
bit of building I have to work with this
eye shadow a little bit because it's not
as creamy as the rest of them but once
you do you get a nice reddish brown
color now I'm going to take this eye
shadow from colour-pop it's called
mittens it's a really really like
reddish deep kind of brown I'm singing
throughout this whole video I was
feeling my playlist
anyway I'm applying this to my entire
lid I love this color it's so gorgeous
so I'm applying this all the way up to
my crease not really passing my crease
so much just applying it as an all-over
lid
Schade I'm going to go back into that
brown that reddish brown from the
palette and I'm going to start to blend
this color this part takes a long time
it's like a process because we are I'm
trying to mix these two colors really
well and blend them together nicely so
just go back and forth it just takes a
while but it you get there eventually
I'm taking grandstand from the new
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows it's
amazing as you can see by my reaction
and on a flat shader brush I'm going to
apply this mainly to the center of my
lid like right dab in the middle so that
a lot of light can reflect to that part
of the eye and I'm going to start
applying and then I'm going to start
blending it into the mittens color a
little bit just working my brush around
so that it's not just a stark line of
that color does that make sense you see
me you see me you see me working it
mainly in the center of the lid
going back into mittens I'm just going
to deepen out with the outer part of my
eyelid and my crease a little bit and
then freaking out because I think the
UPS man was there for me anyway and then
I'm going to deepen out the inner corner
as well I kind of want to keep the main
focus of the grand stand eyeshadow right
in the center as you can
said it a million times going right back
into that reddish brown and I'm just
going to further blend everything out
some more take your time with this and
try to blend everything together I'm
going to take this cream color again and
I'm going to apply this underneath my
brow bone and I'm also going to apply
this to the inner part of my eye as well
and then to further highlight because
that doesn't give me enough highlight
I'm going to go into the white eyeshadow
with this tiny little crease brush from
makeup geek and I'm going to apply this
the high points of my eyebrows to
highlight and right in my inner
tear-duct as well to highlight some more
I'm taking another makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow this is in the shade Showtime
and I'm gonna run this right underneath
my lower lash line
it's a beautiful burgundy color with a
lot of like Sheen to it but it's just so
so pretty I love it this is a tiny
crease brush from makeup geek but I use
it as a pencil brush because it's tiny
this is Max Coast to recycle and I am
applying this to my waterline and my
tight line as well it's a very very red
Brown like it's very warm very red it's
a brown but it's a lot of red to it I'm
going to go back into this Grand Stand
eyeshadow and apply it right in the
center of my lower lash line there as
you can see just to add a little bit
more shine I'm going to prime my
eyelashes this is the Lancome Lancome
so spoo Sur eyelash primer is really
good and then I'm going to apply the
Tarte gifted mascara right on top and
then I'm just going to go ahead and
finish my face I told you guys I already
had my foundation and concealer on so
I'm going to move on to bronzer I'm
going to contour using the benefit hoola
bronzer and my zoeva 109 brush and I'm
just going to use this to carve out my
cheekbones etc etc you know the jist
contouring and such
also going to run that brush on my
temples on my forehead all the places
where you guys know I would just
naturally contour
you
Oh oh my god okay back to back to Bronte
I'm going to take another benefit Fox
powder this is in the shade Dallas it's
kind of bronzy but it's plummy its Mavi
it's like a blush and a bronzer
all-in-one so I'm taking this giant
brush from zoeva this is the 109 brush
and then I thought my blush smelled good
for a second and then I'm gonna apply
this to my cheeks just to kind of give a
little bit more warmth to the look I
didn't want to do like a full-on blush
that my eyes were so like deep so I'm
just kind of putting this everywhere cuz
it has like that beautiful Magnus and
bronze eNOS at the same time and then to
highlight I'm using the elf baked
highlighter actually this is the elf
baked blush in pink tastic but it's very
much a highlighter so I'm using that to
highlight my cheekbones and on the
bridge of my nose and such and then to
finish off my lips this is the Too Faced
natural no the Too Faced perfect lips
lip liner in the shade perfect nude in
my makeup geek review of the foiled
eyeshadows my lips looked a little bit
glossy that's because I applied buxom
white brush and lip gloss right on top
after I had filmed this video so that is
the lip combo I'm wearing in that video
but yeah that is the finished look thank
you guys so much for watching and please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
