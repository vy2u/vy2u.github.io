tutorial on this look and I know what
you're thinking before I get the
comments I know this is a look that
you've seen before I know I have
multiple looks on my channel that look
like this very warm colors but I really
wanted to show you guys my favorite way
to wear the new liquid lipstick I
created in Havana nights a lot of you
guys wanted to see a tutorial on the
look I posted on Instagram which was
this look pretty much and I know that it
looks so similar to things I've already
done but for the sake of this lippy I
wanted to just be honest and show you
what I usually wear with this lip color
so you want to see how to get that look
or this look just keep watching so I'm
going to start off with my Mac prep and
prime 24 hour extended eye base this is
the best like a colorless primer ever
and I'm gonna go into my Becca ombre
Rouge palette and we're going to use
these eyeshadows in order so I'm going
to take the first shadow and I'm
basically setting the primer with this
and then I'm going to go into a fluffy
brush and I'm going to dip it into that
second color and I'm going to start
applying my crease shade so I'm applying
this color first so that all the colors
can blend really nicely on top of it I'm
not being neat with this I'm not being
precise or anything I'm just blending in
my crease then I'm going to go with the
next shade over and I'm going to do the
exact same thing this look is very very
easy very easy to recreate it would
probably look really beautiful with a
nice intense winged as well but I
decided to keep it simple like I've been
keeping it these days when I've been
wearing it wearing yeah that make sense
okay now I'm going to take the next
color over which is my favorite color in
this palette it's the orange shade and I
love it so much so I'm going to do the
exact same thing just applying this on
the outer corners of my eyes and then
dragging it into my crease and I've been
using the same brush throughout this
entire video it is these two for a pro
crease brush
and yes now I'm going to take the BH
Cosmetics Carli bybel palette and I'm
going to take this matte yellow shade
and I'm going to clean up underneath my
brow bone with this color essentially
highlighting with it but I'm making sure
that the colors I put on my crease don't
go too far up then I'm going to take the
orange shade again and do the exact same
thing now I'm going to take the darker
shade in the palette it took a really
pretty red color and on a smaller brush
this time I'm going to start packing
this on the outer corners of my eyes and
then dragging it into my crease I'm
going to go back into that yellow shade
I used earlier from the Carli bybel
palette and I'm just going to brighten
up my inner corners I want that inner
part of the lid to look nice and bright
okay so I'm going to finish off my face
or start my face before I finish my eyes
I'm going to take the pixie glow mists
I'm going to give it a good shake and
then I'm going to spray this on my
entire face and I'm going to let it dry
and once it dries it gives you a
beautiful this is it dry and it's a
beautiful glowy appearance I love this
stuff before primer now I'm going to go
into my Nivea post shave balm the
sensitive version and this is a great
great amazing primer I love this it
keeps my makeup on the entire day it's
crazy and it's like a $5 it's very good
I'm going to take my x1 and visit wear
foundation and I'm going to take this
sponge it looks pretty much identical to
the Real Techniques sponge but it's from
the brand pure mineral it has the same
shape I just couldn't find my Real
Techniques one but playing with this one
I really really love this sponge from
pure so I use the flat side and then I
just turn it over to suck up any excess
product I'm in the shade f-100 if any of
you guys were wondering in the
foundation so I'm going to try out our
new product this is the first time I try
it on camera this is the make up for
ever ultra HD concealer they're coming
out with a concealer very soon and I'm
using our 20 I believe and this is a
more salmon tone like a more peachy
concealer and I'm
using this I can cover up all the
darkness under there because the mama
hasn't been sleeping in a in a very long
time what is sleep sleep is for the weak
but I'm just blending that in with the
other side of the pure mineral sponge
and then I'm going to set my under eye
concealer using my Too Faced cocoa
contour kit and I'm going to use the
light cocoa shade as you can see I hit
pan I love it it's my favorite under eye
setting powder because it really really
brightens underneath the eyes this is a
real techniques setting brush by the way
and perfect for that setting I love it
I'm also going to put this on late and
like in between my eyebrows on my nose
and stuff even though I didn't put any
concealer there but it is a brightening
powder and I like to powder those areas
but I'm going to take a big fluffy brush
from Real Techniques as well and I'm
going to dip it into my it cosmetics bye
bye forest powder and I'm just gonna set
the rest of my face so that my contour
can go on a lot smoother and everything
is nice and slow okay so I'm going to
finish off my eyes really quick I'm
going to take this eyeshadow on a pencil
brush and I'm just gonna buff that
underneath my lower lash line and then
I'm gonna I'm pointing at this shade but
I'm not putting that shade on I'm
putting the shade too it's right it's
like a nice reddish copper shade and I'm
just blending that underneath my eyes
that was from the Carli bybel palette by
the way I love this eyeshadow it's like
an intense copper it's beautiful and I'm
just fluffing that underneath my eyes
and then I'm going to take this gold
right here and I'm going to put this on
the inner part of my lower lash line and
a little bit on my inner tear-duct as
well I love this look because it's like
a shimmery messy lower lash line and I
think it looks really pretty I'm gonna
take the big eye shadow in this palette
well it's technically a highlight but
it's like as a pinky one it's the second
shade
and I'm going to highlight my inner
corners with this and then I'm going to
apply a ton of mascara I can't really
find my falsies at the moment but this
would look really great with falsies but
I'm going to check another box to find
some falsies but I just put on a
crap-ton of mascara so now I'm going to
highlight with a cream product so that's
why I'm applying this first this is from
the brand la girls it is a cream
highlight I will leave the name down
below because I can't remember off the
top of my head but it is a beautiful
beautiful product I like applying it
with my finger so I don't disrupt my
foundation as opposed to just like
swiping it on my cheekbones so after I
do that I'm going to go back into my
cocoa contour kit I'm going to take a
medium cocoa with this Sigma angled
contour brush and I'm going to start
contouring my cheeks with this
this brush just really lays down the
product so pretty and now you have to do
is blend it takes like no effort at all
it's amazing now I'm going to take this
elf brush and I was like man my
background really makes my brushes just
disappear into nothing but it's a face
brush from ELF it's pretty much brand
new and then I'm going to take my Milani
berry amore baked blush and I'm gonna
use this as my blush this has been like
my freakin favorite blush ever so now
for my face highlight I'm gonna take the
second shade out of the highlighters and
I'm gonna highlight my face with this
holy crap this second highlight in this
little highlighting part is amazing it
makes your cheeks look wet it is
stunning it's beautiful it's like a pink
color oh I love it so so much and now
for the star of the show I'm using the
ofra long lasting liquid lipstick in the
shape of a tonight's which is the shade
I created with them it is now available
I will link it down below
I love it so much that completes this
look but if you did want to get a little
bit crazier I'm gonna take Miami fever
and I'm gonna do kind of like an ombre
lip so I'm applying Miami paper just in
the center and then I'm blending it out
with my fingers that completes this
video guys I hope you enjoyed thank you
