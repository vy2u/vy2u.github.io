tutorial on this look right here it is a
like a dramatic smoky eye but it's like
a turquoise like a dark dark dark dark
aqua smoky eye I was gonna put on some
false lashes with this look cuz I really
think it calls for false lashes but I
lost my lash glue so I just put on the
mascara which I like it with mascara by
itself anyway I actually filmed this
look like a year and a half ago and
never uploaded it cuz I didn't like how
it turned out but I was always obsessed
with this eyeshadow from Mac anyway I
think this is a great smokey eye for
those of you who are used to neutrals
it's like a good way to wear color in a
wearable way so if you want to see how
to get Z's Luke then just keep on
watching so I'm starting by priming out
my eyelids using Mac's painterly
paint-pot
and apparently I prime my eyelids like a
savage like I didn't notice how rough I
am but anyway I'm taking this morphe
eyeshadow it's called deep skin and I'm
using this Sephora blending brush to
apply this into my crease this is going
to be the transition shade and then I'm
going to take this Rimmel Kate Moss
chubby eyeshadow stick I forgot the name
of it but it's like a really pretty aqua
teal and I'm first applying that to my
entire lid and then blending it out with
my finger this is one of my favorite Mac
eyeshadows it's called plumage and it's
just a deep teal it's really if you hear
a dog's collar my dogs are in the room
yes it's just a deep teal it's really
pretty and I'm just taking my time and
packing this on my entire lid and then
I'm going to take this little morphe
fluffy blending brush it's a bit smaller
and I'm going to take that same
eyeshadow the plumage one and I'm going
to start
building this into my crease so that the
lid shade can blend seamlessly into my
crease color so I'm just taking my time
with that and blending it all out I'm
going back into deep skin by morphe and
I'm just gonna do the exact same thing
and just buff out the colors in the
crease going right back into plumage by
Mac and I'm just gonna do the same thing
and just pack that on my in test my dogs
just going to pack that on my entire lid
because with all the blending a lot of
the shadow starts to fall so now I'm
taking um this is brown script by Mac
it's like a red Brown and I'm going to
sandwich this shade in between those two
other colors we were using so I'm just
adding Brown script to my crease and
then again adding plumage to my lid this
is makeup geeks white lies eyes shadow
and I'm just using this to highlight my
brow bone now I'm going to take this
black eyeshadow from makeup geek it's
called corrupt I believe and I'm going
to use this as an eyeliner so on an
angled brush by Ecotools I'm just
packing this close to my lashes so I'm
going to finish off my face before I
continue my eyes this is the Becca
backlight priming filter I believe
that's what it's called it makes my skin
very very glowy I love this primer can
you tell luminousness luminousness not a
word okay this is the Maybelline better
skin foundation I'm applying this with a
flat top brush by makeup geek and I'm
just applying that to my whole face but
you've seen me do my foundation about a
million times so I just kind of skipped
skipped skipped Wow couldn't say that
word I skipped over that and then I used
the L'Oreal True Match concealer
underneath my eyes and I blended it out
with this Real Techniques like bold
metals brush to set that I'm using the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
I'm setting that with the setting brush
by Real Techniques and I'm just putting
that everywhere I put concealer
okay now let's finish the eyes this is
the NYX um gel black eyeliner and I'm
tight lining this and adding the
to my waterline as well then I'm going
to take plumage and this morphe pencil
brush I'm just going to start blending
that underneath on my lower lash line
now I'm going to take deep skin again on
a pencil brush and do the same thing
just blending this on my lower lash line
making things nice and smoky and then
I'm just packing on the mascara I'm
using the benefit roller lash you can go
ahead and use falsies of course but I
thought it looked really pretty without
the falsies but again you do whatever
you want alright now let's go ahead and
just finish off the face this is the NYX
contour kit and I'm taking this morphe
brush it's from the flawless collection
I don't exactly remember which one but
it's like that tulip shaped brush and
I'm just gonna contour my face with this
brush and that powder I showed in the
contour kit and then I realized oh I
didn't highlight my inner corner
whoopsie I forget to do that a lot this
is makeup geek shimma shimma now I'm
getting a more warm color in the contour
kit like the other color I use was to
hollow out the cheeks into contour and
then this shade I'm using to kind of
warm up my face just a little bit but I
am using the same brush to do all of
that just adding that to my temples and
such and now I'm going to take this
banana color in the contour kit and I'm
going to use this to sharpen up my
contour just to make it stronger I'm not
into that whole baking trend it's a
little bit much for me but just swiping
some powder underneath your contour can
make a world of a difference now I'm
taking this Real Techniques multitask
brush and I'm applying Mac's warm Sol
blush to my cheeks I love this blush it
gives a nice warmth to my face this is
the mary lou manizer by the balm it's
such a beautiful highlight and I'm just
taking that setting brush I used earlier
and I'm highlighting the tops of my
cheekbones with this powder and on my
nose as well and any other places I want
to highlight
okay so for my lips I'm just taking this
Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude lip liner
and I'm filling my entire lips and then
I'm going to go over it with this
Anastacio lip gloss in the shade
undressed and that is all I did for the
lips I really hope you guys enjoyed this
look I really loved it thank you guys so
