intro quickly because my camera is dying
I feel like my camera is always dying
first of all I excuse my hair today I
went on at Tyrell today it's just you
know getting close to those really hot
summer days and sometimes I just don't
want to do my hair but anyway I filmed
this look for you guys it's mainly
focusing on like glowy skin and
natural-looking skin it is still a full
face of makeup again I did my eyes I did
my face and put on lipstick I filled in
my eyebrows it is a full face of makeup
but it's very suitable for summer and it
doesn't feel heavy I literally feel like
I have nothing on my skin and it's very
glowy as you can see and the colors on
the eyes really represent summer I think
perfectly so I really hope you like this
look let me know down below if you did
and if you want to see how I got this
glowing summer makeup look then keep
watching hey guys so first I'm starting
with my mac fix+ and I like using this
before I put on my makeup because it
really just refreshes the skin and it
preps it for your makeup it's really
good now I'm taking my ELF eyelid primer
and I'm going to put this all over my
lid and up to my brow bone
next I'm going in with rubenesque Paint
Pot and it is just this gold color but
with a hint of pink I think it's perfect
for summer I never reach for this during
the winter but for spring and summer
it's perfect I am putting this all over
my lid and I'm using this as a base for
my other eyeshadows
now with a fluffy blending brush I am
taking this color right here called cork
and I'm putting this in my crease you
can use any matte brown eyeshadow as
long as it's not too dark
I'm not going to be precise with this at
all I just kind of want to use this as a
transition color
next I'm taking this tiny little brush
by Coastal Scents and I am using this
with that same color on my lower lash
line
next I'm taking max amber lights
eyeshadow and I am putting this on my
entire lid
and taking it on a 217 brush because it
doesn't deposit so much color and I
don't want it too intense
this is a very orange tone gold so if
it's too orange for you you can use any
gold you want I'm obsessed with this
eyeshadow I think it is so perfect for
summer
now I'm just taking that fluffy blending
brush again and I'm just gonna blend
everything out like I said before I
don't want it too intense so I'm just
gonna smoke it out and kind of diffuse
the colors a little now I'm just going
to highlight and I'm using Mac's shroom
you can use any highlight you want now
on a regular day I would normally use
black eyeliner I always do but for this
look I am taking my Anastasia matte
highlighter and I'm using this on my
waterline it's just really going to
brighten up your eyes I'm taking my
Maybelline ilegal lengths mascara and
I'm using this because it's a
lengthening mascara as opposed to a
volumizing one and I feel like on me
lengthening mascaras look a lot more
natural and for this look I don't want
clumpy volumizing lashes at all okay
moving on to the face I am taking my
L'Oreal magic lumi light infusing primer
and I'm going to prime my face with this
I usually use this as a highlight but
I'm using it as a primer today because
it gives such a dewy glow to the skin
now I'm going to make some tinted
moisturizer I am taking my Revlon
Colorstay this is the one for normal to
dry skin and I put some moisturizer on
the back of my hand you can use any
moisturizer you want maybe one with SPF
would be more ideal for the summer time
just to protect your face and I
literally put a dot of Revlon Colorstay
on the back of my hand and I'm going to
take my foundation brush and kind of mix
them together to create tinted
moisturizer
I feel like this is perfect for this
summer because it's not going to give
you such heavy coverage and it's not
going to feel heavy on your skin at all
it's going to feel nice and moisturize
but give you a little bit of coverage
like a normal tinted moisturizer would I
mean you can go ahead and use tinted
moisturizer but I like doing this
instead now I'm taking my Maybelline
instant age rewind dark circle eraser
and I'm putting very little just to
cover my dark circles this isn't
necessary unless you have crazy dark
circles like I do I'm just putting it
tiny bit and blending it out with my
fingers now I'm taking my MSF natural in
the shade medium and I'm using this to
set my under eye concealer because if I
don't it will crease like crazy if you
have oily skin it's probably ideal for
you to set the tinted moisturizer as
well but I like the dewy luminous glow
here I'm just filling in my eyebrows
with a light brown color I usually use
my Anastasia brow Wiz but I feel like
this is a lot more natural and I do not
like bold brows in the summer I don't
know so I'm just filling them in really
naturally
I am taking my bronzing powder in the
shade refined golden and this is without
a doubt my favorite bronzer in this
summer as you can see right now it has
these little specks of gold glitter in
it that just gives you such a nice glow
to the skin I'm using a duo fiber brush
to apply it because it does give you
more of a sheer application and this
bronzer can get a little heavy a little
quickly so that's why I'm using this
brush and now I'm at the Sun run away so
as you can see I'm not really contouring
my face
at all I'm just bronzing the places
where you would normally bronze on my
chin on my temples on my cheeks a little
down my nose just to give myself an
overall bronzed look I'm also taking
some of that bronzer onto my neck onto
my collarbone and on my chest a little
now I'm taking this blush by via
bombshell cosmetics it is in the shade
sweet cheeks and this is a very very
highly pigmented blush with a lot of
sheen to it so I do not use a highlight
when I use this I'm taking it on the
same brush because like I said it's very
pigmented and I don't want that much
blush on my face
so what I'm doing here is taking some
blush off the actual brush and making
sure that there's no excess blush on it
and I am just going to blend everything
out I wanted to look more sunkissed than
actual blush you know what I mean so as
you can see this blush gives you a nice
highlight so I don't need to use one now
I'm taking the curvy girl lip perfection
jumbo gloss balm and ballet twist I love
this because it's a light pink with a
little bit of goals and I think it's
perfect for this look I think that these
covergirl gloss balms are perfect for
the summer because it's not sticky like
a lip gloss and it's not heavy like a
lipstick it feels like nothing on the
lips which i think is what we want in
this summer then i'm just finishing off
my makeup with mac's fix+
and that is the final look guys I hope
