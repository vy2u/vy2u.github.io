on products that I found disappointing
for one reason or another now I know
everybody says this in the beginning of
these videos but just because I found
them kind of disappointing and these
didn't work for me doesn't mean they're
bad products actually really like a lot
of these brands it's just these certain
products didn't work for me it might
even be your Holy Grail product or your
Holy Grail items something that you
really love but it just didn't work out
for me and I don't like to be negative
that's why I never really do videos like
this but I thought it would be
interesting to see products I dislike
okay so I'm going to go ahead and get
started
the first two products will probably be
no surprise to you if you saw the video
where I tried these out for the first
time these are the L'Oreal True Match
Lumi powder Glo illuminators I despise
these so much they are not good and I
know that a lot of people rave about
them a lot of people love them but I did
not especially this one this one's
alright but this one is really really
glittery like I applied it to my cheek
and it looked great on camera but as
soon as I got up close it emphasized my
pores so badly you really saw the
texture of my skin underneath and it was
just so glittery that by the end of the
day there was glitter all over my face
like specks of glitter all over my face
but for that reason they were 100% so
disappointing I regret buying these and
I was going to return them but I lost my
receipt so okay so another product that
everyone raves about but it just did not
sit well with my skin it's the smashbox
photo finish foundation primer this is
the pore minimizing one no matter what
moisturizer I use sometimes primers will
ball up if you use a moisturizer that
doesn't work well with the primers
formula but no matter what moisturizer I
use oil free whatever this balled up on
my skin it just like caked in the areas
that I put it in and got really thick
and yeah it minimized my pores but I put
foundation on top of it and it just made
skin look really bad like it dried out
my skin and it just got like thick and
Bali and I really really don't like this
this is something I loved only the very
first time I used it this is the
covergirl the super sizer mascara
mascara is very hit-or-miss with a lot
of people but this one just did not work
for me it worked so pretty like so
beautifully the first time I used it
oh my goodness there is someone right
outside my window like on the phone and
staring dead at me watching me film some
guy this is algo taco alright super
embarrassing moment of the day like I
was saying this looked so nice the first
time I used it like really nice I was
like woah this might be my new favorite
mascara and then did like a complete 180
on me the second time I tried it it was
so clumpy and so thick that it looked
like I had two lashes like this it just
did not work for me it was way too wet
and I prefer drier mascaras so this next
product I was really excited to try but
I I was this is the these are the Tarte
Amazonian colored clay tinted brow gels
I thought things were going to be so
amazing because the wand is tiny
they made it little bitty one like it
just looks like a tube you can't even
see the wand I thought perfect the
perfect sized wand to get right at my
tail because sometimes the Loreal brow
stylist plumper will like dirty around
my tail because it's a thicker wand so I
was like yes but not this does nothing
this deposits nothing honestly like the
first time I used it I was like did I
get a bad one like you try to apply this
to your eyebrows and nothing comes off
and I even pumped it I wiggled it around
I tried to scoop up some product but
maybe it's because the wand is so small
that no product gets deposited on your
eyebrows but honestly I don't even think
it's that I think it's the formula it's
so dry like nothing comes like
nothing ok so I've heard a lot of people
really love this product and I think
that maybe I just got the wrong color I
don't know if this is the one that
everybody loves but this is the Sonia
Kashuk chic luminosity highlighter stick
this is in the shade Persian sunset it's
such a gorgeous pinky shade and if I
swatch her you're like oh that's
beautiful and yeah it does look very
beautiful but it's not for some reason
when I apply this to my cheeks like it
comes off very very powdery and it's a
cream and it almost looks very glittery
I don't know I like a sheen kind of
highlight not something that's too
chunky and I found that this was kind of
chunky and no matter how I applied it it
took off my foundation underneath like I
have the benefit Watts up and I could
run a brush over it and then apply it to
my cheeks and it does not disturb the
foundation or the makeup underneath but
this does no matter how I apply it from
the stick with the brush it just moves
my foundation underneath and then you
can see my skin and it's a big headache
and for that reason this disappointed me
okay so this product is so raved about
this is the Boscia luminizing black mask
I have this little guy I don't know how
I got this and I was so excited to use
this I put a very very thick layer
because my friend was like hey you're
going to use that apply a very thick
layer because if not it will hurt so I
did exactly that and I applied a very
thick layer so it was really really easy
to peel off if you apply a thin layer it
hurts trying to peel it off it's a very
intense mask like when you peel this off
like if you have little fuzzies or
little hairs knees on your Pacey's it
takes them it takes it with it so you
have to be a little careful but that is
not why I didn't like it not because it
hurt because it's not a big deal he's
just you know rip it off like a band-aid
let's just take it off and it hurts but
then it goes away this broke me out I
had like three pimples the next morning
when I had this like it really irritated
my skin I don't know if it's because I'm
sensitive and this is not for sensitive
skin but it just really really irritated
my skin so I never used it again this
next product is gonna saw shock
shock a lot of you because I know a lot
of you guys love this this is the simple
cleansing micellar water and I don't
love this don't get me wrong okay so I
this is not 100% disappointing because I
will so use this for my face this takes
off my face makeup perfectly fine but I
find that it doesn't hold a candle to my
Bioderma it is a lot cheaper than by
older mess so for that reason I probably
will even still repurchase this to take
off my face makeup but for some crazy
reason I don't know if I'm the only one
this burns my eyes like I try to take
off my eye makeup with this and it was
stinging the crap out of my eyes and I
didn't think that that would happen
gently wipe around closed eyes avoid
getting into your eyes well I don't
think I avoided it very well but anyway
I use Bioderma like in my eye and it
doesn't burn my eyes at all like I can
go right up in there with Bioderma and
it's like I have the sensitive version
maybe that's why but it doesn't sting
while this stings it just it was painful
I want to talk about three liquid
lipsticks that disappointed me severely
severely that was a really aggressive
I'm sorry the first one is the Stila
stay all day liquid lipstick in the
shade desoto
now I love these the liquid lipstick in
patina is my favorite Aria is my
favorite even loved duly say-so to Scott
did say I love these so much but this
one was a hot mess I don't know why
because you would think that the
formulas were all the same but I wore
this one I walk it I wore patina to fame
Expo on Friday and it wore beautifully
when I got to my hotel room at the end
of the day patina was still on my lips
perfectly intact then I wore this one on
Saturday
or was it Saturday and then I wore this
one on Sunday I don't know
and within an hour I had red crumbles
all over my chin like it broke up like
it came off in little crumblies my
sister was like you like got some stuff
I love her your chin and it was this and
I was only wearing it for like two hours
so I had to take it off and then put on
a lipstick that my friend mud Yvette was
wearing and for that reason I will never
wear this again because there's no point
during this I was just gonna crumble two
hours later oh the next two liquid
lipsticks are from anastasia beverly
hills and i have their new ones like I
have Veronica I have sepia sepia trust
issues and for some reason I haven't
tried sepia or Veronica
but I tried trust issues and that one I
feel like has a different formula do you
guys know if the new ones have a
different formula because I really liked
trust issues when I used it I don't like
these at all this one in vintage is a
hot mess I wore this when I went to go
visit color pop one day when I went to
go like create the eyeshadows and I had
this on and as soon as I got to the to
like the color pop headquarters they
brought me coffee and I was sipping on
my coffee and like I looked in the
mirror and I had purple I had purple
it's smeared it didn't even crumble off
it was just purple like it smeared on my
chin and I have to take it off and then
put on a purple lipstick from colour-pop
so I don't know why my friend Gaby had
the exact same problem with this
specific one it smears the other one I
don't like is pure Hollywood
now this one is raved about everybody
loves pure Hollywood and it's a
beautiful color I don't have any
problems with it smearing or crumbling
off but this gives me the nastiest white
ring on the inside of my mouth within
minutes that I can't wear it like
literally thirty minutes later I have
that crusty crap just piled up right
here like thick and white and disgusting
and it's not very flattering so okay so
another lip product but this one is from
the drugstore this is the l'oreal
collection Prive by jennifer lopez in
the shade Jennifer's nude I'm going to
be honest the only reason why I bought
this is because it is a Jennifer Lopez
lipstick and she is my everything and
this color is gorgeous I have no
complaints on the color no complaints on
the formula I have used this like twice
in a video before I mean look how
beautiful that color is it's such a
stunning color
but I cannot wear this this smells like
grandpa bill farted and they put it into
a tube and then I just come to realize
that it's just the L'Oreal lipstick
smell and for that reason I don't have
any L'Oreal lipsticks this is the one
and only one and I just can't wear it
because the scent 100% lingers like I
can still smell it on my lips thirty
minutes after I'm done with my makeup
and I don't have that problem with any
other lipstick so I just can't deal with
the scent of this okay so this next
product um I'm really really really sad
that this didn't work and kind of
shocked at the same time because first
aid beauty is great for sensitive skin
but these are the facial radiance pads
exfoliate tones and brightens this
burned the crap out of my face like as I
was using it my skin started to get
really red really irritated and I felt
like it was on fire and I don't know why
so that freaked me out
I mean it's alcohol-free it's great for
sensitive skin but it freaked me out
that I only used it once I have all
these things left so I think I'm going
to pass it along to a friend of mine cuz
I hear great things but burned I don't
like these I don't like these at all I
have tried so hard to like these to love
these and I can't these are the rim
Oprah vocalist it's kind of like their
version of liquid lipstick but every
single one that I have is really really
patchy and so incredibly sticky I have
to use it with the gloss on the other
end because alone is just way too sticky
and then that kind of defeats the
purpose for me because I want it to be
matched but it doesn't work that way so
I chose I don't I don't like these this
is the Lancome les felicito deficit just
kidding I don't know how to read that
that's French this is their brow expert
crayon it's there
eyebrow pencil this is Lancome that's
expensive and that's not glued this
faded so fast in my eyebrow eye I was a
little bit shocked to see how quickly
this just faded throughout the day and
this spoolie hurts cuz it's like a brush
it's like barely it's like just put a
spoolie why I put this little stick with
like three little things it just hurts
my eyebrows I don't know I just really
really didn't like it I won't be using
it again because I want my eyebrows to
last all day and this just faded way too
fast this is the last product and I was
so sad about this I'm not completely
disappointed I will so use it because
momma paid a pretty penny for it but
this is the hourglass ambient lighting
blush in the shade dim infusion this is
what it looks like this is 100% my fault
it's not the products fault it is a nice
product but it is it more of a highlight
than it is a blush to be honest this has
the ambient lighting powder in the shade
dim light infused with the Coralie
peachy blush but there's barely any
color to this it's mostly dim light so
it does not show up on my cheeks at all
it looks like I'm just putting on face
powder as a blush so I really really was
disappointed with the with the color
payoff it just didn't work on my skin
tone maybe this is great for very very
very very very fair milky skin tones cuz
I don't think it would show up on
anybody darker than that so so sad
okay guys so that completes this video
these are products that I found kind of
disappointing I hope I didn't offend
