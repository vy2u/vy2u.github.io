a disappointing products video I want to
make it a point to do these every few
months because you guys really liked the
last one I posted and basically if
you've never seen one of these videos of
mine I'm just going to sit here and talk
to you guys about products that I own
that kind of disappointed me
they are mostly makeup products and they
are just not my favorite for one reason
or another by the way I did just film
this makeup tutorial but this should
already be up in my channel it was my
Valentine's Day makeup tutorial I will
link it below if you are interested
before I get started I do want to give
the typical disclaimer and I know that
you're probably sick of hearing these in
the beginning of every video that has to
do with like disappointing products but
you guys have no idea how offended some
people get when they love products that
I don't like some people get really mad
at me for not liking a product they love
please don't take any offense this video
I'm really not trying to offend anyone
everyone's skin tone is different skin
type is different we just also have
different preferences and different ones
not everybody's gonna like the same
exact thing products are just gonna work
differently for different people because
we're different so if you love any of
these products that I'm gonna mention
today please don't get upset they just
didn't work for me I wish they would've
I don't like hating products but they
just didn't work for me okay so the
first product I'm gonna talk about I
immediately bought this on Sephora once
I saw it was released I was actually
anticipating the release of this product
and it is the Josie Maran whipped argan
oil face butter if you are familiar with
Josie Maran she has like a cult favorite
argan oil body butter so when she
released the face butter I was like oh
my gosh that's probably amazing but it
just didn't work for me and I wanted it
to work so bad because it's unscented
and it says ultra hydrating and it's for
intense hydration it says intense
hydration on the back this has really
good ingredients it even has like pure
argan oil in it which sits really well
on my skin but for some reason this
clogs my pores so bad I don't know if
it's because it's so so so rich and so
hydrating its unscented I don't
why I smelled that but I applied this as
my moisturizer at nighttime and when I
woke up the next day I had like those
little Melia bumps all over my face but
they weren't all over they were just
like here in this area those little
white bumps which makes me so sad I
don't know I'm going to try to continue
to use this product see if maybe I could
apply a lot less I don't know if I
applied too much I'm just kind of
hesitant to try it again because my skin
just like it was like all bumpy and
cloggy after this okay so this next
product I've had for so long and I'm
just finally gonna throw it away it
needs to be tossed anyway but I've just
never liked it and I don't even know why
I kept it around this is the Mac Paint
Pot in the shade rubenesque I bought
this so long ago you guys it was the
reason why I bought this is because
Bethany Mota mentioned this in a
favorites video
when choose to do like monthly favorites
every month that was how long ago I
bought this but anyway I love Mac Paint
Pots especially painterly it's like my
Holy Grail I shadow base but this one is
so bad and I'm so sad because it is such
a beautiful color which i think is why
I've held onto it for so long because
every time I look at it I want to make
it work because it is stunning it's like
a peachy pinky golden Paint Pot it looks
a lot like melon from Mac melon is a
pigment it looks really similar to melon
which is one of my favorite Mac pigments
but this just does not work on the lid
when you go to apply it it doesn't apply
evenly when you initially apply this on
your eyes you're like oh my god this is
beautiful but the second you start to
blend this in like the pigment just goes
away and you're just left with like this
weird Glary uneven base it's so weird
like pretty much blends away and it's
super patchy and like weird and chunky
and it's always been like that it's not
because it's old it's always been like
that but I'm finally gonna throw this
away okay so my next disappointing
product is a major disappointment this
is the covergirl trublend face primer
for dry skin I'm going to do an
tire like really big drugstore review
video I'm not exactly sure if that video
is gonna go up before this one but even
though there were a few products that
disappointed me from my drugstore haul
they aren't all included in this video
because some of them were not like super
disappointing some of them I just don't
really like so I mean whatever this was
so disappointing and not because it
sucked because it doesn't suck this
really really irritated my skin I had
two pimples like really big right here
on my face the next day after using this
and I knew it was this because I hadn't
used anything new aside from this and it
made my face it she liked while I was
going about my day the day that I
applied this my face was itching and I
was like scratching my face and I was
like I don't understand why my face is
itchy but I didn't really think anything
of it until I saw the nice little
pimples on my face the next day I just
really really really did not like this
and I also don't like the smell this
smells like straight-up Elmer's glue the
scent Oh smells like glue like paste I
don't like it so if you have really
really sensitive skin I might stay away
from this because it's not goo at least
not for me okay so a major letdown these
are all major this video is so negative
I hate sounding so negative I just feel
like since I'm always talking about
products I love I do have to throw in
products I don't love every once in a
while
I bought this the second I saw I'm
always stalking Sephora's like just
released or just added lists where they
update like all the newest products I
just got into Sephora I'm always
stalking that and then I saw this and I
bought it immediately because I love
these Sephora pro brushes I think
they're incredible like amazing they're
very very pricey but I think they're
very good so when I saw this I had to
pick it up it looked so interesting this
is the Sephora Pro Press full coverage
complexion brush number 66 it has like
the coolest shape I don't know if you
can see it kind of has like a tip right
here it looks like a Beauty Blender like
it is a really really cool brush and I
thought it would be perfect
for my foundation and like to get around
my nose because of that cool little tip
and to get like right here underneath my
eyes just to blend everything out but
when I use this I had used a foundation
that I had used time and time again and
this
made my foundation looks so streaky I've
never had it look so bad ever I have had
Russia's make my foundation look a
little bit streaky but nothing too bad
and I usually just go over it with like
a Beauty Blender and it's fine this I
saw like the brushstrokes like it was
streaky I don't know if it's because the
bristles are so short and it's so dense
this brush is so incredibly dense that
it just didn't work for me but my cover
FX custom brush is really dense and it
doesn't give me the street asst I don't
know this is just my personal opinion I
don't like this brush at all and it was
like over $30 so I totally regret buying
this another sephora product I bought
the second I saw it was new and I don't
like this at all this is the glam glow
plump rageous matte lip treatment I got
it because it said matte lip treatment
it's basically a lip plumper with like a
matte finish really really cool so you
basically just do this the packaging is
so weird I almost broke it the first
time I open it because I thought it came
off like this I got thought with a cap
but no you twist it and then you take it
out through here and it has like this
cool little wand you apply it and it is
kind of like a matte finish it does like
fill in your lines really really cool
but this is the most painful lip plumper
in the entire world and I know what
you're thinking like hello it's a lip
plumper what did you expect like come on
but no no no I can take any lip plumper
I'm not one of those people that is
really really sensitive to lip plumpers
I don't even feel like the dryness of
really dry Oh liquid lipsticks like my
lips can take a lot but this was
incredibly painful like on another level
of pain I can do the two-faced lip
injection one that people think is like
really crazy burning I could deal with
it I mean it burns someone burns a lot
but it's not so bad this is like a
physical torture my lips felt like they
were literally on fire I can't imagine
anybody liking this like leave me a
comment down below if you like this if
if I'm applying too much am I like doing
something wrong this was so painful and
I never ever want this anywhere near my
lips ever again
so this next product I
love I'm obsessed with this liquid
eyeliner this is the Jessie's Girl
liquid liner I think it's the best like
drugstore like pen style liquid liner
it's amazing I have mine in black it's
fabulous
so when I saw that Jessie's Girl
released colors I was so excited they
only had black ones available on their
website that's where I buy mine when I
saw they released like a blue one a
green one and I forgot one other color I
was so excited I bought all of them
online and when I got them I was
severely disappointed I don't have them
to share with you because I was so
frustrated with them that I literally
like threw them away because they were
just so bad I was kind of concerned that
I got a dud or something I'm not exactly
sure but it was the blue one and the
green one that I really really did not
like I was just so shocked at the fact
that they can make a black one so
intense so black so matte and beautiful
and then their green one and their blue
one was like so watery barely any
pigmentation it was just not good I
really really did not like the colorful
Jessie's Girl liquid liners so if you're
someone like me who's a huge fan of
these and you want to try the colorful
ones I would say skip it because they
were just the pigmentation was lacking a
hundred percent I don't know I did not
like them at all okay so this next
product is probably going to shock a lot
of you because I feel like a lot of
people love this and I've even used this
in a tutorial like it was a prom
tutorial I did last year but I have just
been on the fence with it for so long
but I finally decided that I don't like
it and it is the Tarte tartlet palette I
don't know if I've mentioned before that
I don't like it I have really really bad
memory just throwing it out there so I
might have mentioned this did I mention
this in my last products I regret buying
video oh my god that would be so
embarrassing
I like this when I first got I was like
finally a palette that has a bunch of
cool tone shades in there where I can
just grab that whenever I want like a
purpley smokey eye or like a gray smokey
eye I thought it was perfect but I did
have some trouble blending out these
eyeshadows but I didn't think anything
of it until until I discovered the Tarte
tartlet in blue
palette and this palette is so beyond
amazing that this one just doesn't
compare if if I think about it it just
does not compare the colors in this
palette blend so nicely they're not
chalky they're not choppy they're not
like hard or weird that they're amazing
they're amazing when you go to swatch
this one in comparison the powders are
very stiff they're really really hard to
blend I feel like you have to be an
insane professional to get a really nice
blended look with these shadows I
struggle with these a lot and I wonder
why the pigmentation is so different
like I wonder why the quality is so good
in this one and kind of so-so in this
one maybe I got a bad one let me know if
you have the regular tartlet palette and
if you love it I've heard a lot of
people rave about this one maybe I did
get one that was just formulated weird
because they don't blend like I want
them to they don't blend like these do
ok another disappointing product this is
the Nivea daily essentials Express
hydration primer I was so excited when I
saw this on Amazon I was like wow
Nivea has an actual primer for your face
if you guys know nikkietutorials
totally made the Nivea post shave balm a
very famous primer like I use it all the
time as a primer and it really really
keeps my makeup in place all day like
it's a $5 product and my makeup lasts
all day makes my skin feel amazing
makeup sits fantastic on top of it
wonderful I love it this not so much I
found it just didn't do anything it's
not a bad product it's just a little bit
disappointing because it did nothing for
me like it was just a moisturizer I
don't feel like it primed my skin my
makeup didn't sit better on top of it it
was just a basic old primer and it was
more expensive than my Nivea one or my
other Nivea one I don't know I just
don't really like this a lot of you guys
were asking what I thought about this
after all turns out I don't really like
it I don't hate it
I don't think it's bad I just don't like
ok I have two Burberry makeup products
to share with you guys and the funny
thing is that I've only purchased two
Burberry makeup products ever and
they're both kind of disappointing so
the first one is this one right here and
it is their light glow natural blush in
the shade earthy
I love the packaging on this you guys
saw me haul this not that long ago I
love the packaging I think it's
beautiful but when you open it you're
like Burberry what the heck thank you
for giving me half a blush and for
charging me so much for it I mean
obviously what was I expecting this is a
Burberry blush it's going to be
expensive
and I mean you could totally see it on
Sephora that it is half a blush like
they're not deceiving you they show you
on Sephora that you get only this much
blush and when I was looking at it
online I was like oh it's fine it's okay
it's little but I could deal with it I
just find that it's so little that my
blush brush I kind of have to like turn
my blush brush around so that I can pick
up a lot of the product on my brush even
though it is my fault
I knew it looked like this and I just
don't think it's anything special in
terms of formulation actually really
like the color it's like a nude blush
but I don't know it's not my favorite I
find myself reaching for other blushes
more than this one I think it's a little
bit overpriced and I'm going to continue
to use this because I paid a lot of
money for this but I will say that there
are blushes like the Tarte Amazonian
clay blushes that last a lot longer
and are cheaper so with that being said
this isn't great but it's not bad either
I don't know it's just a little bit
disappointing okay and then the other
Burberry product that I was a little bit
disappointed with was this this is the
Burberry fresh glow nude radiance number
one this had amazing reviews so I really
wanted to buy it it's a base for your
makeup you apply this as a primer you
apply this before your foundation and
it's supposed to give you like a
beautiful luminous glow I love the
packaging Burberry it has like fantastic
packaging it has a pump I love the
packaging
I just find it did nothing special I
think that my Becca backlight priming
filter is so much nicer than this and it
is a little bit less expensive Becca's
not drugstore by any means but it is
cheaper than Burberry and when I put on
my Becca one I just find that my skin is
so glowy and radiant and just like a
beautiful Sheen like it looks gorgeous
but this I just find that I don't get
that much luminosity and it kind of has
like little tiny little specks of
shimmer I just don't like how this looks
on my skin and it kind of dried my skin
I know
that's really weird but the consistency
is just so strange that it didn't leave
my face moisturized it kind of left my
face like it left a film on my face if
that makes sense
I don't know I don't really love this
product maybe for people with oily skin
you might like this because it's not -
do we not - glowy I think you might like
this if you have oily skin but for me I
just much prefer my Becca back my
priming filter and for that I totally
regret buying this because I will always
reach for that one before this one so it
was kind of like a waste of money
okay let's talk about liquid lipsticks I
have two liquid lipsticks from two
different brands both are from the
drugstore both pretty disappointing for
different reasons so the first one I
want to talk about are the Revlon
Colorstay ultimate liquid lipsticks they
look like this when I bought them and I
saw them at the store I'm like oh my god
Revlon has liquid lipsticks and nobody
talks about them that's so weird
yeah I totally know why nobody talks
about them they're horrible they're so
horrible these are the stickiest liquid
lipsticks I have ever seen they dry to
an incredibly sticky finish you can't
even put your lips together like right
now I'm wearing a liquid lipstick I'm
wearing the Milani amore matte lip cream
and I could put my lips together like I
could rub my lips together and nothing
happens you cannot put your lips
together because they will stick like
your lips will stick to one another when
you have these Revlon liquid lipsticks
on they're so bad
are they being discontinued is that why
nobody talks about them they should be
discontinued because they are not good
and then the other liquid lipstick I was
disappointed in are the Maybelline vivid
matte liquid lips and these are in bad
these would actually be really good if
they had a different name for example if
they were like the Maybelline vivid
liquid lip colors then yeah they'd be
they'd be really nice like really
beautiful but the fact that they had the
name matte in the title is the reason
why they're disappointing because they
threw me off I was expecting to get a
matte liquid lipstick but these don't
dry these like stay glossy it's like so
strange they are very comfortable
comfortable they are very comfortable
and they are very very beautiful the
colors
nice they just don't drive to like a
liquid lipstick finish like a matte
finish and I feel like why I call it
matte it is not you know okay we're
almost done
sorry my Mario's are okay home this is
the st. Tropez Saint Tropez gradual tan
in shower this is like an in shower
tanner and I know you're thinking like
you must have liked that because you
finished it and yes I did finish it
because I bought this and I didn't want
it to go to waste you know I don't want
to waste my money so I used it all but
this is so stupid to me this is a pure
gimmick you're supposed to okay I told
you what to do on the back you're
supposed to get in your shower wash your
body like you normally would and then
whilst in the shower but not under the
shower you're supposed to like turn your
shower off okay so you're in the shower
your shower then you turn off your
shower then you apply this to your whole
body you like massage it in kind of like
if it was a body wash you know you put
it everywhere
then you wait three minutes and then
after you wait the three minutes that
honestly feel like an eternity the
longest three minutes of your life
because you're just standing there cold
in a shower like this after you wait
those three minutes then you rinse it
get out of the shower and you pat
yourself dry and it's like wow I'm like
gradually gonna be ten once I use this
for like a week and a half no the first
day I use this the next day when I woke
up I didn't notice a difference it is a
gradual tanner you're not gonna get like
super dark the next day you're supposed
to use this every single day in the
shower and then like notice a gradual
tan which I'm okay with unlike gradual
towns like the dragon the Dragons one I
really loved it from dragons this is
just so gimmicky because you're just
standing there in the shower for like
three minutes it's just so uncomfortable
it's awkward you're cold because you
have to turn the shower off cuz you're
not gonna let your shower like run for
three minutes and waste water like that
so you turn it off and you it's just so
it's an uncomfortable process and I
didn't like doing it so while I used it
I will not be repurchasing and I do not
recommend this at all okay so my last
disappointing product is a cult favorite
and it is the NARS eater brush and I
have this tiny little one because it
came in this bronzer right here this is
my NARS Tahiti bronzer which is just
Laguna it's actually like Laguna and
then it came with this right here and I
thought that this would be a great idea
so I bought it online because I had
always wanted to try the NARS eita brush
but it took a $50 brush so I figured um
I could try it out in this little set I
don't know maybe it's the fact that it's
short that maybe the big one like the
actual full size is a better brush but
it's not the handle that I don't like
it's not it's not that it's the actual
bristles this this sheds like a mofo
okay okay even though I do like the
shape of it I love the shape of this it
kind of scratches my face a little bit I
just don't like the bristles on this
brush I think that makeup geek makes a
better brushes a way that makes a better
a better brush elf makes a better
contour brush it's six dollars and it
kind of has the same shape I really just
don't feel that this is worth the money
I don't think it's worth the money so
for that reason I find this little NARS
Itoh brush totally disappointing I'm
still going to keep this in this little
bronzer and when I travel I'll probably
use that to contour with because it's
perfect for travel but it's not anything
crazy it's nothing to write home about
you know okay guys so that completes
this video these are just products that
I found disappointing for one reason or
another please give this video a thumbs
up if you enjoy these kinds of videos so
I know to continue to do them so yes I
think that's all I have to say thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
