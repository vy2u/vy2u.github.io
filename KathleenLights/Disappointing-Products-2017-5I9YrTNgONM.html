another disappointing products video I
always make it a point to do these
videos every so often because I know you
guys really enjoy them and I get to talk
about products that didn't really work
out for me not saying these products are
bad but for some reason I just didn't
really click with these products if some
of these things are your absolute
favorites please don't take offence do
you guys make my little Jersey shirt
thingy
it's just toon squad I bought it off set
forever21 website and I love Space Jam
so when I saw this I was like I have to
buy that but anyway let's get into the
product that disappointed me from one
reason or another the first product I
want to talk about it's something that I
know a lot of people rave about and it
just I just didn't work for me this is a
Marc Jacobs magic marker precision pen
eyeliner in the shade of blacker I don't
remember if this was sent to me or if I
bought it I'm pretty sure I bought it I
heard so many people rave about it but I
don't really like it I do love the fact
that it's a brush I love a brush style
tip not a felt tip in my opinion a lot
of felt tip eyeliner is just dry out so
fast but this one is so watery I don't
know what it is about it but when I
apply it to my eyes it kind of looks
see-through have to go over the eyeliner
about three times in order to get it
like really black and really opaque and
for the price I feel like that's it
that's crazy
it's a Marc Jacobs eyeliner I shouldn't
have to apply more than one layer
considering my black eyeliner from
Jessie's girl is super matte super black
and I only have to use it like one time
it's almost like they dipped a little
bit of water into this and then mix it
up and sold it don't get me wrong it
does last a really long time on the eyes
I don't find that it cracks it doesn't
smudge like it stays put but the fact
that it is slightly sheer it kind of
sinks into my lines and spreads a little
bit that makes sense you know what I'm
talking about I hope so
maybe I got a bad one because I hear
everyone rave about this but I just did
not like this okay so my next is the
playing product was this this is the Wet
n Wild color icon rainbow highlighter in
unicorn glow I kind of assumed I wasn't
going to like it because I don't wear
highlights better this color but I
thought it would be really pretty to
just use like the yellow shades like the
golden shades because that is wearable
but this is so chunky like really shonky
it doesn't even really give you much
Sheen to the face because there's so
much chunkiness happen
there's so many glitter particles in
this it just doesn't look flattering it
looks powdery it looks a little bit
chalky I just I'd really don't like this
which kind of sucks because I do love
what in wilds powder formula this
precious petals highlight by what a
while is amazing I mean I know this is a
rainbow one so it's not going to be the
same but it's not the colors I don't
like it's just the formula it's I don't
like it okay my next product I was so
excited to try this I had the highest of
hope this is the Giorgio Armani eyes to
kill mascara I have never heard anyone
say anything bad about this mascara I
feel like everyone totally loves it but
it's much like crazy on me I don't
understand I've only used it twice but
the two times I used it I was like I
don't want to wear this anymore it
transferred completely all over here
like all of it and I have to be honest
that rarely happens to me with mascara
it was really volumizing and it looked
really good I loved it initially but I
just I don't want to wear a mascara I
was just going to smudge all over my
plate so for that reason it's totally
disappointing for me I mean I could try
using this just on my top lashes maybe
it's not a great lower lash mascara so
for that reason I was disappointing to
me because it was like $30 I mean I
don't know I just I don't like somebody
stuff and method doesn't smudgy stuff
okay something like disappointment is so
strange and I was really reading reviews
on this and a lot of people agree with
me but then there were certain people
who said it was really good for certain
of it you know what let's get into it
okay
this is a Sephora Pro dimensional
highlighting palette and I bought the
warm one first of all the packaging is
amazing but anyway it has five cream
highlighters or like I wouldn't call
these creams these are more Vaseline
feeling like a little more oily versus
creamy and there were a few people
defending this product on the Sephora
reviews saying that it's only really for
professionals not professionals but it's
for like pro makeup editorial stuff and
like runway stuff photography that kind
of highlight it's not for the average
day-to-day person trying to highlight
their face because these feel extremely
oily like when you put your finger in
like okay this one is like a dark bronze
shade like nothing nothing comes off
because it's so oily like look at that
look at this even in this peachy one
does goal
one is just an oily highlight and it's
just not something I would ever use I
didn't think it was going to be like
this it thought it was going to be more
of like a cream highlight I could
totally see how this would work for
somebody who's doing a photo shoot and
wants that really intense glossy look to
the face that's like tacky when you
touch it and yet this is perfect because
when you blend it on the skin your face
looks wet it's like sticky and wet and
kind of grows to wear out on the daily
basis but for like the runway really
cool photo shoots yeah that's totally
cool I agree with you but I just I don't
like this for me I might keep this
around for like really cool photo shoots
if I'm like photographing myself for
like a makeup look or something I should
have done more research I should have
totally looked into this before buying
it because I didn't know it was this
kind of highlighting palette I thought
they were just cream highlights but
they're not so I really really don't
like these like and usually if I don't
like face wipes I'm like now you know
what they're better out there and I just
throw it in the trash I don't really
save it for a disappointing product I
mean I might have spoken about wipes in
the past but only in some very
passionate well how much I don't like
them and I really don't like these these
are the honest Beauty refreshingly clean
makeup remover wipes these are remove
makeup I don't know if there's something
wrong with my face my favorite wipes
from the drugstore are these simple
micellar wipes they take off all of my
makeup my favorite high-end ones are the
ko Jindo I also really love the ones
from Murad but this I don't know I felt
like I had to use four sheets to remove
a full face of makeup with these when
normally all I need is two I use double
the sheets with this I went to this so
fast because it just didn't do a good
job of removing makeup I would swipe it
on my face and there was still like
foundation left behind is didn't do a
good job of removing mascara nothing
don't get me wrong I know that honest
Beauty has really amazing ingredients I
love honest Beauty I just didn't really
like this has chamomile has aloe it has
everything I could possibly dream up in
a face wipe I love the ingredients but I
just felt like I had to struggle to
remove my makeup and I don't I don't
really want to do that okay so let's
have a lot of highlights that I recently
purchased and I was shocked at how much
I did not like it this is the Tarte
Amazonian clay highlighter in the shade
sparkler it's one of their new shades I
bought this because I love their
highlight in the shade exposed right
here is such a beautiful champagne color
that gives you
such a stunning Sheen to the face it
looks really natural and beautiful and
glowy I love this so I thought I would
really really like this one but oh my
god I don't like this though this is so
chunky like unbelievably chunky that
when you swatch it where's the glow
where's the sheen whistle luminosity to
this it's not there so it's a little bit
too thick and chunky and glittery for me
and you can't already tell by all my
videos I don't like a chunky glittery
highlight I don't like the highlight on
the face to look like sparkly and just
like crazy out there I like more of a
glow a sheen something luminous and
fresh and this no this is a cream
contour and highlighting palette from
Kardashian beauty it is called their
contour case and I have the shade light
/ medium this sucks kind of you're
supposed to contour with this conceal
your face with this and then highlight
your face with this I just do not like
how these cream products blend I don't
so much have a problem with the contour
as I do with like the concealer and the
highlighter try using this to conceal
it's just a little bit too sticky and
this is just like I don't know it's a
little too cakey for me I think I read a
couple positive reviews about this but
for me it just looked thick on the face
I have very dry skin so a lot of the
times of a cream product is just too
thick you could really tell on my skin
and these two were just a little bit too
thick for me it's usable don't get me
wrong I just I don't think this is that
good and I feel like for Kardashian
beauty I don't know okay am I crazy or
do they not check their products before
it releases I don't want to sound like
an asshole I hate bashing of brands or
bashing anyone but if I'm a Kardashian
would I release all the products in
Kardashian baby because I've tried a lot
and I also be honest there's so many
things from Kardashian beauty that I
don't like that I'm sure this has really
good stuff like I know their highlight
is good there a couple products I have
tried in the past that I didn't really
like but overall I would say it's one of
my least favorite brands at Ulta and why
why I feel like they know about makeup
these girls these productions they know
about makeup I mean they have makeup
artists that do their makeup but they
they should know right I know they
wanted something affordable and
something drugstore but I feel like to
just stamp their name on something and
they were like you make it I know if we
don't like Kylie cosmetics that I feel
like Kylie cosmetically kylie actually
puts that into her product
and actually wears them and uses them
have you seen a Kardashian new
Kardashian beauty I don't know I don't
know okay and then the last products I'm
so sad I'm so sad I don't like this this
is the hourglass ambient lighting
editing surreal light this is the most
beautiful hourglass packaging I have
ever seen I am addicted to anything
marble I love the look it's so classy
and beautiful so when I saw this come
out I was like oh my gosh this is like
this is it this is the ultimate thing I
love hourglass there ambient lighting
powders are amazing i just recently
spoke about them and like my favorite
natural highlights video I love them I
just don't really like this so when you
open it like this you get a ton of stuff
beautiful right I know so gorgeous this
right here is a finishing powder so like
a face powder to give you like a soft
glow this right here is supposed to be a
bronzer this is a wrong shoes this is
not dark enough to be a bronzer well
maybe if you're really really fair
bronzer is called surreal bronze light
the finishing powder is called surreal
light and then this right here is a
blush and this is called surreal glow I
don't mind using this one you guys know
I like a really subtle blush and this
one gives you a really pretty very soft
everyday pink color so I don't mind this
blush it is supposed to be a strobing
powder and this is called surreal strobe
light and then this is another blush and
surreal effect this blush is okay too
the issue I have with this palette is
that every single freaking product in
this has glitter I feel like all my
products in my disappointing products
video they're all because of glitter and
that's why like I said if this is your
Holy Grail palette I'm sorry I
personally don't like glitter but a lot
of people do it oh I don't like glitter
on my face I like it on that Oh No
this liquid lipstick is like cracking
off and falling on my chin which is
weird because I've used it like a
hundred times before hmm
and it's so strange why is that
happening in effect patching off right
here well I think I know what's going to
be in my next at the pointed products
video anyway I don't mind blush with a
little bit of glitter in it like there's
a lot of blushes in my collection that
have glitter that I use I love which is
why I don't mind the blushes I like them
but do I think it's worth it even if I
just like two shades
probably not good bronzer doesn't show
up on my skin as a bronzer it's almost
like another
this strobing cart is full of glitter
and then the finishing powder has the
least amount of glitter in this pallet
but it's still there it still shows up
so when I run this all over my entire
face - just give me a little bit of a
glow there's like little sparkles on my
face and it just for some reason I don't
vibe with a glittery face
I just don't I feel like it kind of
makes my skin and I'm only speaking for
myself please don't be offended it kind
of makes my skin with a little dirty and
then I always get the comments like oh
you have like glitter on your face and
just rather avoid that I already like it
okay guys so that's an wait this video
these are products I recently tried out
that I didn't really like that much for
one reason or another like I said please
don't be offended if these are your
favorites we're all so different we're
bounced like different things and these
were just like they're not horrible they
just I rather use other things in my
collection so yeah leave me a comment
down below letting me know what your
most disappointing product was recently

did not like let me know in the comments
below
