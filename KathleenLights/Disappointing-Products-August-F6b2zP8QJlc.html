another disappointing products video
I've done these like a hundred times
already I try to do them every month
because I'm constantly trying out new
makeup so there are some things that are
bound to disappoint me and these
products they kind of did now I know I
give the same disclaimer in every video
but please don't be offended if some of
these are your favorite products they
personally just didn't work for me for
one reason or another so please take
this video with a grain of salt and
let's just jump into it I know some of
you know where that's from okay so I
have to start off with the thing that
disappointed me the most I was actually
really shocked but I don't like this and
this is a super super raved about
perfume this is from my lab oh I think
that's the name of the brand and this is
the perfume that's called Sun towel 33 I
purchased this on the North storm
website without even without even
smelling it cuz I'm crazy like that
I just heard so many people raving about
it I was like wow I'm gonna love that
I really don't and it's crazy because
when I was in LA I was with Sharon from
colour-pop and I was like oh my gosh are
you wearing sound towel 33 inches I
guess I am and it smelled so good on her
like I recognized his scent but with her
body it smelled so good and I smelled
her the entire day like every time she
would walk by me I would smell it so I
can see why people truly love it because
honestly it smelled great on her and in
the back of my mind I was like man that
does no smell like that on me on me it
smells really weird I feel like my body
reacts really well to sweet scents
especially but clean scents work well my
body chemistry and so do certain florals
but this is so so rough and there are a
couple
perfumes I have that are really musky
but this is too much on me it smells too
natural if Li say it kind of gives me a
bad odor makes me smell a little old no
if I saw the grandpas out there but it
kind of makes me smell like oh crap I'm
not even a grandma my grandpa the
lasting power is so amazing I wish I
loved it and let me tell you that's
expensive but I'm gonna give this one to
my mother because I think she would
really really like this but I personally
did this disappointed me like seriously
this seems like a really really good
idea this is a brush from the brand
Sigma and it is there for DHD Kabuki
brush when I got this in them
I was like oh my gosh why didn't I think
of that this is the perfect under-eye
concealer brush because it has this
perfect little triangle I mean look how
perfect it goes right up in there
I don't know if I'm crazy but this
doesn't blend out my concealer it almost
gives you a patchy application it's so
strange the concealer doesn't distribute
on your face like it doesn't move it
around and blend it right into the skin
you don't get a smooth application it
just makes your concealer look weird and
patchy and dry I don't know how a brush
can do that but it did and I tried it
twice in two times I hate it and had to
use another brush to blend out the
concealer because this just was not
doing it really don't like this brush it
was such a letdown for me because I got
so excited when I opened this package I
was like oh my god the brush I've been
waiting for but yeah it was an odd an
odd blending brush really I mean I don't
even know if it's for under-eye
concealer but that's what I used it for
and this is a pass for me okay so I have
really been into this brand antonym I
recently picked up a few things from
Sephora and I've been loving it I love
the baked foundation it's really nice
and I like they're baked blushes they're
also really really good so I thought I
would love this this is their organic
highlighter and endless summer and I
love this packaging you know it's really
bulky but I do like this packaging and I
like their ingredients I like what this
brand is about you know they're really
natural they're organic I love
everything about it but I don't like
this highlighter and this summer is just
a little too sparkly for me I feel like
there isn't a sheen in it at all it's
mainly just Sparkle it is a really
pretty color I just don't like all the
little shimmers in it it's just like a
soft color with tiny tiny tiny little
shimmers but it's like all over the
place so really I just don't like how
this looks on my skin it doesn't even
look like a highlighter there's a soft
glow there but it's so minimal and
usually I love minimal highlights but
the little sparkles just throw me off
and I just I personally don't like this
highlight and I truly don't see myself
ever using this again so I'm gonna give
this away to a friend of mine I mean
it's not crazy it's not bad it's just
not the kind of high
I'm looking for dude dude this is the
Oribe gold less dry shampoo I have this
little one I don't know if I got it as a
sample when I ordered stuff off the
Oribe website or if I paid for this I
don't remember but I don't like this dry
shampoo it was really strange stretchin
poos I feel like works so differently
for so many people but I don't like
textured dry shampoos I use dry shampoo
to take out all the oils to refresh my
hair but I don't use it as like a
texturizer like a lot of people do and I
feel like this is kind of like this
isn't the or abate texturizer but I
don't feel like this did anything for me
are you a dry shampoo cuz I don't know
it didn't suck up any of my oils it
didn't it didn't do anything for me I
kind of wet my hair a little bit my hair
looked even greasy er than it did before
I don't know really really strange and
I'm mentioning it because I know that or
BAE is a super pricey brand and I like a
lot of their things but I don't like
this dry shampoo it does know thing so I
would never like pay for the full size
of this cos I can get batiste for a
cheaper and it's better so so I need to
talk about these but I do have a few
things I have to say these are the k'kaw
beauty contour kits they also come with
this brush here's the thing I had no
idea this was even gonna come to my
doorstep I don't know how I ended up on
that list but I've been playing around
with them for a couple days I got them
like three days ago and I've been
playing around with them and there's so
many things I want to say about this
okay so here here here okay
I'm not someone who hates the
Kardashians there are a lot of people
who really let dislike them but I don't
know them I try not to hate people I
don't know there's so many things that
go on behind the scenes things you don't
see on TV or Twitter on social media and
I truly like them they seem like a good
family who really care about each other
they seem like good people regardless of
how they became famous or what they're
doing with their life it doesn't affect
me I don't care but I picture something
a little bit more from Kim Kardashian I
love the packaging and I love the color
everybody thinks this color is boring I
love this color this nude I'm all about
it and I really like the fact that she
came out with three different kits you
have a contour kit for light skin tones
this is what it looks like and
you have a contour kit for medium skin
tones a list lenses and then you have a
contour kit for deep skin tones and it
looks like this with each kit you get a
brush you get a double sided brush which
I know a lot of people don't like this
brush I think it's very very soft like
this side right here is so soft I didn't
try out her previous brush because I
didn't buy it and I didn't try out that
brush and I didn't try out that cream
contour kit so I don't know about those
things but this brush is really really
soft this round part isn't as soft as
this one the only issue is I don't love
double ends and brushes because it's
really hard to store them I mean you
can't take this off and then store it
like this but then it's like it's just
weird so I don't love this brush it
seems a little drug story for me and I
don't want to sound mean or anything but
I just feel like this brush like Kim
Kardashian wouldn't launch this brush I
don't know if I'm sounding crazy but for
me she's such an icon for makeup and I
picture her with something a little more
luxurious especially for these prices
that's the issue I have with this I'm
gonna get into the actual product in a
second but these are like fifty two
dollars each yes you get the brush with
it but that's expensive for what it is I
don't think these are worth the price
and only because I don't love the
contour powders I do love that there's a
mirror by the way a really nice mirror
too I love this packaging do not get me
wrong this packaging is amazing I don't
know why people don't like it I think
it's great it's very sleek you could
throw this anywhere I love this
packaging but these powders I don't love
them and I know it's not up to me to
decide what people like but I feel like
for the light kit which is what I would
be this is way too cool tone for me I
know a lot of people love cool tones I'm
just giving you my personal experiences
to cool tone for me and then this is
just a little bit too warm for me I was
able to make it work yesterday when I
was playing with him because I dipped
into both of them at the very same time
and then I contoured like that and it
worked out by using them on their own I
don't I don't love them but the
highlights are gorgeous I'm actually
wearing this highlight on my cheekbones
right now and I mixed it with the gold
in the medium kit so those two
highlights right there I mix those
together and that's the highlight I'm
wearing on my face and I love it
these are highlights I personally would
launch my
like if I had a company like a makeup
company these the kind of highlights I
would do because they give off so much
reflection and it's just a sheen there
are no glitters in this it's not chunky
it these highlights are truly truly
gorgeous these contour powders I really
don't love them I also didn't love the
contour powders in the medium kit again
this is like peanut butter no it's too
warm for me I don't want to upset anyone
but actually I really love this color
though and they're also so pigmented I
don't think these powders are for
beginners I don't know I guess I guess
I'm just on the fence if these were
maybe a little bit cheaper I would be
like okay yeah totally worth it
fifty-two dollars for me just to use the
two highlights I don't know I don't know
and that's that's where I'm getting at
with this product when I say it's
disappointing
maybe if she released these individually
like an individual highlight contour
whatever and then that way people could
just buy what they need and what they
use I can't wait to see what her brand
evolves too because it just started out
and I know that a lot of people give her
so much crap because she's kim
kardashian and even though I love Kim
and I love this packaging and this brush
is soft you know I don't know if it's
worth the money that's just all I'm
saying I want to talk about this this is
the unisex healthy glow all your
hydrating summer tint Meister Iser from
Charlotte Tilbury I have two issues with
this product one it's too dark for me
when I go to apply this to my face or to
my body or whatever it just turns orange
on my skin I don't know if you can see
that right there
you probably can't it gives me a weird
oompa-loompa tint and I've seen other
people where and it just makes them look
so bronzy and gorgeous but on my skin
tone it just doesn't work for me the
undertone is off I feel like this would
look better on people that are a little
bit more tan than me which I mean that
has nothing to do with this product it
doesn't mean it's a bad product it's
just for me it didn't work like the
color and also I wish this would have
had SPF in it just because it seems like
that kind of thing that I would be able
to throw on during the day and kind of
use it as like a tinted moisturizer
since it says summer tint moisturizer
and I would have loved to see some SPF
in this but I know there are a lot of
people who hate SPF in their products I
hate it in my foundations but I love it
in my tinted moisturizer so that's the
only reason why it disappointed me for
those two reasons I
really don't see myself ever reaching
for this so for that reason with these
morning I tried I've tried to like this
powder but I don't like it I think I
want to like it so much because when I
swatch it it swatches beautifully but I
don't like it this is the Becca soft
light blurring powder in golden hour I
love this packaging it's a little bulky
but I really like it and I love how this
swatches cuz it gives you a soft angelic
glow to your hand it's beautiful but on
my skin on my face it's too pigmented I
don't know what it is about it because
I'm even tan right now I've got a tan
going on and it's still too pigmented
for my skin tone like I put it on my
face and you could kind of see like the
golden undertone or like this yellowy
salmon undertone and it just looks heavy
it looks too much the color just throws
everything off so I don't like this
product I wish they would come out with
the same product but like in a
translucent version because I think that
it would be so nice for dry skin but
this color it's just the wrong meal okay
so I love primers I'm always trying out
new primers it's like the thing I want
to discover the next best primer for dry
skin to me primer makes a world of a
difference whether that be a moisturizer
or something I have to put something on
my face before I go in with foundation
like immediately because I put on
moisturizer when I wake up in the
morning but that kind of like this all
start off the day so right before I put
on my foundation I have to put down a
base I had to put down something and I
don't like this this is the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer in
radiance
it even has hyaluronic acid and I was so
excited when I got this but I don't like
this for me all it does is give you a
reappearance to the skin it makes your
skin look radiant sure but that just
goes away as soon as you apply your
foundation on top like you look radiant
in the moment like oh I have a nice
little Sheen to my skin and then you put
on your foundation and it's like Oh
looks like that primer did nothing
because it doesn't hydrate it doesn't
moisturize it doesn't give you like a
dewy feel it's not extremely radiant I
have to say it just it fell short from
you and when I blend this out into my
skin within seconds it's gone like the
it does
moisturise I just look slightly radiant
but my skin doesn't feel it you know and
I have really dry skin so I need
something that is gonna make me look
radiant but Thea radiance so that it
works well with the foundation it's just
this nada this does not for some reason
the balm is one of those brands I hate
talking about negatively
I really like the balm I just I really
like that brand and this is the
even-steven whipped foundation ah this
looks terrible of my skin I think maybe
if you have dry I mean oily skin you
might like this a little bit more it
just broke up all around my nose and
between my eyebrows it looked so heavy
on my skin I was shocked I didn't like
this at all even with a little bit of
product it's just something about this
whipped formula doesn't work well with
my skin type I guess it just made my
skin look a little dirty I know that may
sound weird but the foundation looked
like dirty on my face I don't know I
wasn't a big fan of this I gotta say I
don't really like it at all and that
makes me feel bad because I really love
the balm but ok and then the last
product I want to talk about is this
this is the Tarte filter light setting
powder and I love this this is really
really good stuff if I feel like it
almost blurs my skin it sets my
concealer nicely it it just looks so
nice on the skin I love it so I'm sure
you're thinking like okay so then what's
the problem
this gives me so much flashback it's
almost criminal I don't even know why
what is in this I feel like I don't have
that issue with that many powders you
know like flashback issues but they
these looks crazy underneath my eyes at
nighttime
trust me they'll make that mistake I
would only use this during the day and
to be honest I have so many powders in
my collection I don't want to have too
many date powders and too many night
powders I have a few like that but for
the most part I want a powder that just
works morning at night flash photography
not flavored and this is it just doesn't
do it for me
I gotta say okay guys so that completes
this video these were products that
disappointed me for one reason or
another
