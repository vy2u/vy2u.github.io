another disappointing products video I
made a decision to do these monthly if I
have disappointing products throughout
the month because a lot of you guys seem
to like this kind of video even though
everyone's different and everyone likes
different things some of you guys find
this video helpful so I thought I would
do another one
remember I've said it a hundred times
but just because I don't like these
products all that much or I found them
disappointing for one reason or another
doesn't mean they're bad so yeah that's
basically what this video is going to be
about beauty products I recently
purchased or was recently sent and
they're just like my favorite okay so I
have to talk about the wet and wild on
natural palate this is the rosy toned
one it's called nude awakening they have
a brown one like one with more neutral
like warm golden colors but I just don't
love these palettes these eyeshadows are
just not very pigmented the matte ones
are not so bad I can blend the matte
ones out but the shimmery ones like they
are just so powdery and dusty that they
fade extremely fast on the eye like it
might seem like it's packing on some
color at first but it just blends away
into nothing there's no like solid
pigment in these shimmery shadows it's
just like dust
it's a weird formula and anyone can say
like well it's wet and while it's a few
dollars what do you expect no that is
not true what in wild makes amazing eye
shadows they've done that in the past
the comfort zone palette is amazing the
vanity palette I still have that but you
know I'm gonna grab it does anybody
remember this this is like old school
YouTube everyone was using this on
YouTube back in the day
probably like super expired but I still
keep it and use it because it is amazing
quality like where did wet-and-wild go
wrong why can't they create this quality
again it's like come on the walking on
eggshells trio fantastic they're trails
so good the older ones at least I'm just
not impressed with this formula what are
they doing they need to go back to their
old formula there's no excuse but anyway
moving on
so the next product I found a little
disappointing these are the Too Faced
brow quickies brush on brow fibers I
have both colors they sent them to me I
have Universal brunette and Universal
taupe I've tried both of them
I mean they're both the same formula but
the colors are fine it's just I feel
like they do nothing it's like I brush
these on my brows and then I'm like
alright what just happened I don't get
the payoff that I want from a brow gel
with like little fibers in it glossier
has one called the boy brow that just
deposits what much more pigment they
don't deposit enough it's kind of like
I'm brushing nothing on my brows
personally I recently hauled this and I
could not take it if you saw my recent
drugstore haul you know what I'm talking
about
these are the NYX plush gel lipsticks I
have two colors this pink one is called
dime apiece and then this one is called
nude beach beautiful colors I love the
finish of these lipsticks it kind of
gives you exactly what it says it's like
a plushy gel formula gives you a nice
shine really really beautiful but these
smell like horrible I can't get over the
chemically smell and even though it
doesn't smell super horrible in the tube
when I put this on my lips it's all I
can smell and throughout the video like
I just kept tasting it in my throat it
was giving me a thorough ache incredibly
weird but I don't like the taste of this
the scent of this it's like chemically
and it lingers I don't mind if a lip
product smells weird at first but once
you put it on you're like Oh smell is
gone no that is not the case
unless you're totally like not fazed by
sense then yeah okay so now I'm gonna
talk about two disappointing foundations
and they were both disappointing for
completely different reasons let's start
about the one that was disappointing
because I just I simply just don't like
this this is the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation I have two colors one when
I'm a little bit lighter one when I'm a
little bit more tan waste of money
because I really just don't like these I
have really dry skin like I've mentioned
a hundred times so every time a
foundation comes out that claims to be
really dewy really luminous I get really
excited too most of the times I love it
this I just ah ah it's a weird weird
foundation I've used it in a couple of
tutorials and I liked it at first but
every time I wore a different foundation
like every time I wore a foundation that
wasn't this I realized like wow that
Josie Maran one isn't my favorite like I
like this one so much more and I really
don't want to wear a foundation I feel
so so about when I have
foundations I love it feels kind of
heavy on the skin like when you apply
this to your entire face it's definitely
not a foundation that looks natural I
feel like it looks like foundation it's
luminous but almost like in a greasy
feeling not like in a glowy feeling and
it transfers a lot even when I said it I
kind of find that it slips and slides
around my face it's a little bit too
heavy can look a little bit cakey and
that's just not the kind of foundation I
like so it's time for me to give you
away okay so now this foundation I
totally loved I still love but it's
disappointing because it breaks me out
this is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
stay in place makeup everybody raves
about this everybody loves it and I
agree it was so good I do have to use
kind of like a moisturizing primer
underneath but it would last all day on
my skin but it broken me out I'm so sad
every time I wore this when I took it
off at the end of the day I had like
little white bumps all over my forehead
I mean I have some bumps on my forehead
right now but that was caused by
something totally different and even
though they weren't like super red
pimples those bumps were caused by this
so I guess I'm sensitive to this I do
have sensitive skin and I guess this is
just too heavy for sensitive skin so I
recently purchased all of the OPI new
neons collection they came out with a
ton of colors now I have to say I
haven't tried every single color in this
collection but by trying these two I
kind of know I don't love this this is
in the shade green come true and this is
like my ideal green like this is the
most beautiful green polish if you guys
don't know my favorite colors to wear on
my nails are blues and greens it is my
favorite I can just throw away every
color and just keep blues and greens and
maybe throw in a couple like Essie
marshmallows or like light white color
so I was really excited about the new
neons collection but I don't don't I
don't like these I tried to do my
manicure with this nail polish and it
was so difficult
it does recommend to apply the white
base I don't mind doing the extra step
if it means my nail polish are going to
look extra neon but even with the white
base underneath these were really hard
to work with this I had to do three
coats on top of the white coat already
so it's like four coats way too much
work
these have like that see-through jelly
consistency where you have to layer it
and layer it but they don't layer very
well I'm not a huge fan of this and OPI
is one of my favorite nail polish brands
the next product I want to talk about I
don't think it's bad but these are just
not for me these are the color pop
sculpting Stix I gave most of them away
but I kept two of the contour sticks and
then two of the highlighting sticks but
these aren't for me
whenever I try to use the contouring
sticks I find it a little bit hard to
blend blending it out for a while but
then once I blend it out I feel like it
kind of blends out into nothing it's
like the weirdest thing I just prefer a
different kind of cream contouring
personally like with different products
and same goes for the highlighting ones
it's not because these are not good I
just don't love matte crayons for
highlighting underneath the eyes I have
really dry skin and I find that this
kind of emphasize my dryness nah I don't
know okay so next up I have two sponges
to talk about that I really dislike like
a lot of the times I will find a sponge
and I'm like okay you know it's not as
good as the Beauty Blender but it's
alright these two I really don't like
first up is this guy this is the elf
sponge I don't know what the name is but
I bought it online and it came in a trio
this soaks up so much so much foundation
I've never had a sponge that soaked up
this much foundation I actually used it
in a first impression and I actually had
to stop using this and I went in with my
Real Techniques sponge and immediately
you could tell like on this side of the
face where I was using the Real
Techniques sponge it was just blending
out the foundation so much better
instead of just like sucking it all up
and I mean don't get me wrong it was
really really really affordable but
you're wasting so much foundation I
rather spend more money on a sponge that
isn't gonna take it all for me but
anyway my next disappointing sponge is
this I really truly truly really don't
like this this is the new sponge from
Tarte 2 came in a Pierre package with
two of their shape tape concealers and I
was so excited to try this I was like oh
my gosh how cute but this is the
weirdest sponge ever you know how a
Beauty Blender or most makeup sponges
when you put them under water they
expand this one does
I really do that not that that's the
reason I don't like it but this is just
too rough for me I don't I don't love
the texture of this I find that it does
soak up a lot of product as well and
what I dislike the most is the freaking
shape of the sponge most sponges have
like a round bottom like even the elf
one you see how it's like around making
it really easy to bounce on the skin
this one is like kind of round but like
kind of pointy which really throws me
off like when I'm bouncing this on my
face I feel like the pressure is right
here at the tip and it doesn't blend my
foundation in nicely at all I bullet it
makes it go on a little bit patchy and I
think as was it with the shape and
considering its tart it's probably
pretty pricey so I would totally skip on
this sponge it's just my opinion I'm
sorry tart don't hate me I'm really sad
to say that this product was
disappointing for me this is the glam
glow glow starter mega illuminating
moisturizer this smells like heaven to
me I know some people don't like the
scent but I love the scent I want a body
cream in this set so that is a huge plus
for me when something smells good but I
don't I don't love this it says you're
supposed to apply this to your face for
an instant sexy Hollywood glow or layer
with your favorite foundation for a
little extra glow this does nothing for
me this in the shade nude glow I don't
know if they have multiple shades but at
first when you're applying this you're
like ooh this feels really nice and then
when you're done applying it you're like
oh where the hell did I go kind of
blends away into nothing and then you're
left with a little bit of shimmer like a
slight shimmer and I don't mind the
shimmer I really don't but if you're
gonna give me shimmer on my face at
least give me some moisture to go along
with it because then I find it to be
completely pointless it's not bad it's
just average in my opinion glam glow is
a very pricy brand like - suspensive and
that's my word oh honey this if you guys
saw a I don't know a video it was but I
was trying products for the first time
like a first impression and this little
business is a sassy little one like
super says this is the elf aqua primer
mist and this shoot product out and the
first time I use this it was a little
bit startling like I went this braid on
my face and I got like speck like it's
bad at me
and that's not cool well that's not cool
I feel like the key to a good primer
mist is something that honestly mists
product out like you spray it like about
a million times and it just feels like
the little drops just like mist onto
your face in a nice way no this will
spit on you I'd have time for products
that are gonna spit on me okay and my
last disappointing product is kind of
weird but it is this is Ooty or Zoet I
think so tea but I could be wrong it's
like a bar of detergent and it was
highly recommended to me but have you
people to use this to clean my brushes
it's like pink
Zoli so by the way coolest color ever
like it's neon I looked it was
recommended by a few people to use this
on my brushes and especially on my
Beauty Blender
like a lot of people were telling me
that it cleans Beauty Blender like no
other it's amazing and I used it just
I'm not into this not at all
now this is 100% detergent zodia Rizzoli
is a high quality laundry soap and can
be confidently used for washing your
family clothes so I'm sure it's like a
more gentle laundry detergent but like
yeah it's still on your detergent and
while it did clean my Beauty Blender
really well the scent is so strong this
smells oh my god this the scent is
really strong and after I was done like
cleaning my Beauty Blender it got a lot
of the foundation out but I grabbed my
Beauty Blender my holy grail like Beauty
Blender cleaner and I used my Beauty
Blender with that after and foundation
still kept coming out like my Beauty
Blender solid I feel was cleaning it
better than this and even when I was
done cleaning it the scent lingers on my
Beauty Blender or on my makeup sponges
for so long and yeah I know that that's
not a big deal but a lot of people are
sensitive to scents and if you are do
not clean your Beautyblender with this
you're a sponge will smell like
detergent I'm just not a huge fan of
this just use like regular more gentle
soap you know there's a lot of options
out there I have my laundry detergent as
the way to go yeah that completes this
video these were products that I
recently tried out and just a little bit
disappoint

comment down below of something that
recently disappointed you and maybe I'll
avoid it but thank you guys so much for
