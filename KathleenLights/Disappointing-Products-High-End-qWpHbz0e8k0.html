a disappointing products video last time
I did one of these you guys let me know
in the comments that you would like to
see these more often I'm constantly
always trying out testing out new makeup
and sometimes it doesn't always work for
me so that is what we are going to be
talking about in today's video I'm gonna
be discussing products that just didn't
work for me just because these products
didn't work for me
doesn't mean they're bad products we're
all different and we all like different
things so if you guys want to know a few
products that disappointed me then let's
jump into it surprisingly enough I only
have like one drugstore item to share
with you guys most of these are high-end
okay so the first product I'm gonna be
talking about is this product by Bobbi
Brown this is the brightening brick
powder illuminate in the shade pink this
is what it looks like it just has like
six different shades of pink and I don't
know if it's supposed to be a highlight
but that's what I bought it for it's
kind of like a blush topper as well and
I just did not like this the first time
I put this on my face I was like what is
this
barf of glitter but I just put all over
my face it's so Glary which is why I
don't like it if it didn't have all
those crazy micro shimmers and glitters
in it it would be a beautiful product
because I really love the undertone I
love the color it just lays on top of
the skin because it has glitter and it
emphasizes like pores and weird it's I
don't like this product me personally it
actually had pretty good reviews on line
which is why I bought it but it just it
personally did not work for me another
product I was disappointed in I'm really
sad about because I had the highest of
highest expectations for these because
I've heard people rave about them and it
is the OCC lip tars and when I saw that
they came out with their lip tars in an
amazing little packaging like this
because they used to have their lip tars
kind of like in a squeezy tube they
change the packaging they made them so
much better so I picked up these two
colors I got Poyser poster poster poster
and soy latte now the colors are awesome
the formula is awesome literally there
is nothing bad to say about this except
I cannot get over how bad they smell I'm
very very very
sensitive to scents in my lipsticks I
don't know why but every time I wear a
lipstick that is like very chemically
scented or something weird I taste it
and I feel like I just swallowed poison
I don't know that may be dramatic that
is dramatic but I really really really
did not like the scent of these I feel
like I must have gotten bad ones I have
to have gotten bad ones
they smell like if you walked into a
warehouse and everybody was painting but
yet they were painting with rotten paint
that's what this smells like I rather
put on something with like a vanilla
scent or something with no sense at all
okay so my next disappointing product
isn't very disappointing that doesn't
make sense
it's a packaging disappointment it is a
packaging fail so for that reason I'm
including it in this video I will
continue to use it because I love it but
the packaging is so bad I don't
understand this is the deodorant gel by
the brand whish whish is a great great
brand they sell it at Ulta
I've tried they're like deodorant um
wipes that you just like wipe them on
and throw them away they're really great
it's a very natural brand and I just
like them so this is their deodorant Joe
with hair inhibitor basically this
formula is not only supposed to reduce
the odor obviously like your odor it's
also supposed to reduce hair growth like
over time I'm all for it that's great it
has organic aloe organic chamomile and
it's awesome I love I love this oh my
gosh what were they thinking I okay
I had to have gotten a bad one so
basically we are supposed to do it this
is what it looks like it has like a tiny
little hole up here and my hair is a
mess just look in the viewfinder and
realized wow girl you didn't even try
today but that's okay it has a little
hole and you're supposed to turn it
clockwise it says it right here twist
top clockwise to release product and
apply a small amount to each underarm
area this squirts out product when you
try to twist this it like it does not
come out normally like let me see if it
does it ah
I got it all over my hair do you see
what I mean and it scares me is that
supposed to happen the only way that I
find that I can use this if if I turn it
at the speed of a turtle like I have to
sit here and turn it very very slowly
and look it not even then it got onto my
hand it just squirted onto my hand okay
they're gonna get it into my eye into my
hair or I have to sit there and
literally turn it very slowly to get
anything out it's just so weird but I
will continue to use this because I love
it but I wanted to mention this because
do any of you guys have this and do any
of you guys have this same problem my
next disappointing product is from a
brand called makeup revolution and it is
their ultra strobe bomb I have two
colors right here I have the shade
hypnotic which is a like white gold with
an insane yellow shift this is a cream
product and then I also have the shade
euphoria which is kind of like a whitish
color with an insane pink shift now I
really like the formula of these they're
actually very blendable they apply
really nicely I think that makeup
revolution is a great brand but I find
these to be just a little bit unwearable
even though they look stunning and
beautiful here in the pan the dual
chrome in this is just so strong that it
looks almost odd on top of the
cheekbones like this one in hypnotic
when I apply it to the tops of my
cheekbones the yellow is so intense that
I look like have a yellow gold streak
right here and the same with euphoria it
looks like I have a pink stripe on the
top of my cheekbones almost as if I
apply blush way too high on my face
maybe this will work for you if you have
very deep skin I think I might look
really pretty on you actually but for me
just it looks weird my next product I
was a little bit disappointed in these
are the wildly whipped soft matte lip
colors by buxom these are pretty new
they sent me three of their shades this
is one of them this is in the shade
moonlighter the formula on this is just
not my cup of tea I totally see this
working for a lot of people but for me
it just wasn't my favorite this is a
very mu C formula which I typically love
Oprah has a very mu C formula and I love
it this is a strange mu C formula I find
that on my lips it doesn't completely
set down and dry like there's not enough
tackiness to it I don't mind a liquid
lipstick that transfers like when you
kiss as long as it stays in place all
day
this one doesn't it kind of slips around
and it almost stays mu C like it never
really sets I don't know if it's
supposed to but I find that it transfers
a little bit too much and it's a little
bit sloppy and it just looks kind of
strange on my lips if you are someone
who hates liquid lipsticks maybe you'll
like this formula because it is a little
bit more whipped okay so moving on to a
hair product this is from the brand
Oscar blondie this is their dry
conditioner spray it's just like a dry
shampoo only a dry conditioner it's
supposed to add shine and detangle and
all that great stuff
well no not for me I don't know how I
don't know how but I was almost shocked
at how dry this made my hair it's a dry
conditioner it's supposed to add shine
and make your hair soft but it dried out
my ends I have very very very dry
damaged chemically treated hair
I had like a hair malfunction two years
ago slowly but surely I've been getting
it back to normal and back to life so
I'm obsessed with like dry conditioners
and shine sprays and anything that's
gonna make my hair look shiny and this
didn't do that it's just so weird it
almost left a film over the ends of my
hair and it made them like I don't know
it says dry conditioner spray more like
just dry spray not a fan I'm so sad to
be talking about this because Kat Von D
beauty is like one of my favorite brands
I just I love ever I love Kat Von D but
this just didn't it didn't work for me
this is the Kat Von D color correcting
eyeshadow primer I have mine in the
shade fair I was so excited for this
because I love primers that have like
color to them so they not only prime my
lids but they kind of mask the veins I
have
my lids the first time I use this I had
to take it off I have very very very dry
lids and a very very very dry under-eye
it looked so dry on my lids like if you
saw my eyelid up close you saw every
single crack every single crevice every
lick little line I have on my lids this
totally emphasized that and it made me
so sad because it's just so convenient
because it's in a pen I definitely think
that if you have oily eyelids this might
be a good thing for you but for me
personally it emphasized everything and
it made my eye area kind of look old
let's talk about another product that
disappointed me because it was just too
drying this is the Kemna quan sensual
skin enhancer this is an arm and a leg
I'm in the shade sx s x01 and I was
going to return this I hauled this in a
video and I also mentioned in that video
that it wasn't my favorite I was going
to return it and then life happened and
I didn't end up returning it but I hear
people raving about this looks so dry on
me I don't know why and I use very
little of it like it's very thick and I
use the smallest amount and it just omit
the lines it emphasizes everything it
looks really dry underneath and it's not
worth the money in my opinion okay so I
have two more products to share with you
before we are finished this is a very
very very pricey lipstick this is a YSL
lipstick in the shade no 10 their Rouge
pur Couture lipsticks I hate this the
issue I have with this lipstick is the
same issue I have with the lip tars I
can't handle the scent and to think I
paid like $35 for this lipstick actually
I don't remember how many wait 30 or 35
and the scent the color is beautiful
like stunning which is why I bought it
but the scent is so overpowering it
smells very chemically to me that when I
wear it I literally smell and taste it
throughout the entire day I don't mind a
lip product that once I put it on like
the scent goes away no no no no no no no
I smell this on my face the whole time
like it's a constant scent that I'm
smelling it's not a good one so I wore
this one time
never put
I guess kind of a waste of money I just
don't get the hype I actually have the
YSL rouge volupte shine lipstick and the
shade number eight and these smell like
delicious like little strawberry
cupcakes I don't know these smell really
really good this chemical in a tube and
100% regret buying this okay so my last
disappointing product is another product
that I hate because it makes my under
eyes look so dry just like the Kevin
Kwan sensual skin enhancer this is the
amazing concealer illuminate by the
brand amazing concealer I have been
using this a lot for like the past three
weeks I've been trying to love it I've
been putting it to the test because I
love anything illuminating and I just
come to the conclusion that I don't like
this every time I wear a different
concealer and it looks so good I'm like
oh amazing concealer it's not that great
my freaking $3 la girl pro conceal looks
better than this but when you get up
close it looks patchy it emphasizes my
under eyes it kind of emphasizes my dark
circles it just does not look good so I
kind of regret buying this not my
favorite and yeah that's it these were
products that just didn't work for me if
