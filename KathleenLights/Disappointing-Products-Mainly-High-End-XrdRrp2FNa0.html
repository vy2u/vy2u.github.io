another disappointing products video you
guys seem to really like these videos so
I'm trying to do them monthly although I
gotta be honest
discovering products I don't love it's
not my favorite thing I rather discover
products I really love but I try out so
much makeup that I'm bound to discover
things that I don't love I hate to give
the disclaimer in every single video but
please don't be offended if one of these
products is like a holy grail of yours
or something you really like everyone is
so different we're bound to like
different things these are just products
that I was disappointed with for one
reason or another doesn't mean it's bad
it was just like you know not my
favorite you know and I noticed that the
majority of this is high-end there's
only like two drugstore products but
sometimes I love watching these videos
if they're mainly high-end products
because I feel like you have a higher
standard for high end and when it
disappoints you for some reason you're
just like oh so the first product I want
to talk about is actually from Laura
Mercier and this is the baked blush
compact in the shade rosy and this is
what it looks like I think it is so
beautiful it's stunning and I actually
bought this because a friend of mine on
YouTube was raving about it Laura from
mrs. Lola Lynn she was talking about how
much she loved it so I ran out and
bought it we usually have the exact same
taste when it comes to makeup so
anything she raves about I buy and I'm
so sorry to say this Laura if you're
watching I love you but I just don't
like this and the only reason I don't
like this is because it is full of
glitter it is a glitter fart on your
face I've tried to use this so many
different ways with so many different
brushes because I'm crazy about this
color I think it's the most beautiful
rosy natural blush it looks stunning
when it's on but when I get really close
to a mirror I can just see so much
glitter on my face and I don't really
like that because it makes me feel like
my face is dirty
I don't know when there's too much like
glitter specks I'm like something's off
it just makes me feel weird I don't like
glittery things on my face and that is
actually the main reason why I don't
like a lot of these products I like
glitter and my eyeshadows not on my face
so even though the color is wonderful I
just I don't love how much glitter is in
it and I've even tried to like put my
brush in there and then
really really tap it off you can see
most of the glitter flying off but it
just it gets in there but glitter stays
in there I've used it a few times and
every time I put it on I'm like oh I
don't like this so I don't want to force
myself to love it you know I just I just
don't love you and I'm sorry cuz you're
cute but you're glittery okay so my next
product it's not bad I don't dislike it
I just have so many other concealers I
love way more than these and these are
the Becca aqua luminous perfecting
concealers they send me all the colors
and they're just there alright I have
the aqua luminous foundation that
actually a lot of people don't like but
I really really love I mean it's not my
favorite right now because I'm having
some skin issues these days but when my
skin is a little bit less bumpy I really
love that foundation it just looks so
fresh and dewy like coverage and perfect
for every day and I thought I was going
to feel the same way about these but
these have no coverage at all and I'm
okay with sheer coverage when it comes
to foundations but for concealers I want
you to conceal especially around the eye
area I kind of have a lot of darkness
there it can be a little purple and I
want my concealer to really cover that I
also don't love it for blemishes for
that reason that there isn't much
coverage it creases really easily on me
and it just it feels kind of weird
underneath my eyes I don't like how it
sits on my skin it's not my favorite
there's something about it I don't know
what it is but I definitely recommend
other concealers over this one I love
Becca as a brand I feel like they can do
no wrong but this is something that just
kind of disappointed me the Tarte shake
tape concealer is amazing it's so thin
it has full coverage highly recommend
that one I like the Too Faced Born This
Way because it's similar in the sense
that it's more of an everyday fresh
concealer but it has more coverage than
this one
there's just other high-end concealers
that do way better than this I'm sorry I
love you but no okay so I was a big fan
of some of the new wet and wild liquid
lipsticks I even spoke about the red one
in one of my favorites videos they're so
good and they're so affordable but stay
away from these colors like I said these
are their matte liquid lipsticks by Wet
n Wild and this one is take it like a
vamp and then
one is don't be a platinum I love how
wet and wild names their products by the
way they do such a good job at naming
their stuff they're always just like so
punny I love them but anyway these
colors are very very patchy and I even
tried to work with them try to do like
two to three layers but if you try to do
that it just gets really thick but it's
just not the best look and I know that a
lot of companies have that problem where
they're dark liquid lipsticks can be a
little bit patchy but that's no excuse
because there's a lot of other brands
who do dark liquid lipsticks well I
don't know why some brands can get it
and some brands can't like I don't
understand they don't look pretty on the
lips I tried to work with them they just
don't work for me
I'm sure if you use a lip liner similar
to this underneath and then you fill in
your entire lips that you know that can
move that could work I should have tried
that okay so I'm not gonna get rid of
these because I'm sure with a dark lip
liner they might look good but on their
own they're a little bit patchy but the
other colors are really really good the
red one
I think it's called I can't think of
what the name is because I have studied
a Gomez love you like a love song in my
head for some weird reason but these are
becchi I want to talk about this I want
to talk about this because I purchased
it because I heard so many who were
raving about it and I don't like it you
know what I think it is I think that I'm
a Savage
I think Celine's savageness is rubbing
off on me by the way these scratches can
you even see that also mean I feel like
this brush could be amazing if you're
not rough like I am this is the bronze
brush by Marc Jacobs it was so pricey
good good as expensive but I bought it
because I mean it's first of all it's
beautiful and it's so soft and I
actually think Danny bought this for me
like as a surprise I know he bought one
of my Marc Jacobs brushes as a surprise
every time I use this I feel like it
takes off my bronzer so I get my bronzer
you know I open it up and I go to use it
and every time I use it right it just
like dip it in and I start to bronze my
face I feel like this brush is so dense
that as I'm blending it on my face it's
kind of removing my foundation anything
that was already on my skin I feel like
this brush moves it around
it could be just me but I prefer a
bronzer brush that's very very loose and
not as dense not as densely packed maybe
I'm too rough but I'm like putting this
on and it's like removing stuff
underneath it's so weird
then again
I am a savage so I'm sure a lot of you
guys are watching this like a girl I
love that bronzer brush is my favorite
but I just can't get it to work
maybe I suck but I don't let's talk
about some more overly glittery things
so urban decay sent me their new like
fall line and a lot of the stuff was
really really good but this in my
opinion was not this is the Urban Decay
Naked illuminating trio and this is what
it looks like okay first off I have kind
of like a lot of things I don't like
about this sorry it sounds so negative
in this video every time I film a
disappointing products video I get
anxiety while I'm filming I'm like oh my
gosh are people gonna hate me for saying
these things but I mean honestly is the
best policy
so I like that there's a mirror that's
amazing I mean it's a really really nice
oh it's a really nice mirror but the
packaging is just so bulky and the
actual highlights are just like three
tiny little circles I feel like they
could have made the packaging less bulky
I understand that it's baked so they're
like domed and they're a little bit
thicker but not super huge on the
packaging in terms of like traveling
with it and all of that so not my
favorite this brush though this brush is
actually really good you can highlight
with this anyway so initially when you
look at this you're like oh okay like an
illuminating bronzer an illuminating
blush a nun illuminating highlight the
only one in this trio that I actually
like that I would see myself using is
the bronzer because even though it's
glittery it has enough shimmery pigment
throughout that it's not just pure
glitter but I don't feel the same about
these two this highlight shade the Oasis
one it's just it's pure glitter I
personally don't like to highlight the
tops of my cheekbones with glitter it's
kind of shocking how bad this one is I
don't know if I got a bad one because
this blush is not as bad as this this is
pretty bit and maybe that was the point
of this it was like a glittery highlight
but it's just not for me this pinky
highlight is not terrible like it's
definitely usable and it would be a
really pretty eye shadow but again for
my actual face I don't like how much
glitter is in this product
not my favorite to be honest I don't get
the hype with these things I really
don't understand these are the Lancome
juicy shaker's this one is called lemon
explosion I love how this one smells I
know they all have
your incense but this one has a
bubblegum scent oh my gosh it smells
amazing and I hear everybody talk about
how they all smell so good and maybe
it's just this one that I tried I only
have tried one so I I feel like I'm
wrong for judging all of the juicy
shaker's I find it to be a little bit
pointless I like the concept I think
it's really cute it's like a shaker it
makes it a little easy open eat and then
you apply it it's kind of like a tinted
lip-balm kind of like a tinted lip oil I
would say but I feel like this dries out
my lips and my crazy do any of you guys
have that same experience with the juicy
shakers please let me know down below
because I feel crazy when you put them
on initially it's a really pretty soft
color but it fades so quickly the color
is like gone within minutes like minutes
it's gone and then you're left with this
like weird oily residue but it's not a
nourishing oil it's just like this weird
film and then when it dries it kind of
dries out your lips I don't know I know
a lot of people love this I've heard so
many people rave about this but in my
personal experience it's not my favorite
I rather pay way less for a real tinted
lip balm you know I'm saying okay so I
want to talk about two sponges this one
is a shock to you guys because I spoke
about this in my Beauty Blender dupes
video and I talked about how much I love
it and I still do I love this sponge but
I have an issue with it okay so this is
the morphe sponge I know it has a
specific name can't think of it right
now but it's the red one this bunch is
so good it's so good as a Beauty Blender
alternative but for some reason now it's
like really really bleeding in the video
where I spoke about this I talked about
how it was actually the only red sponge
I had tried that didn't really bleed
because the red Beauty Blender awful
it's like bleeds all over your sink it's
a disaster and the first like ten times
when I wash this I didn't notice a lot
of bleeding maybe like two but barely
any bleeding of the red color but now
that I've washed it like a hundred and
eighty times it's just bleeding like
crazy now and it's getting everywhere
like I'm cleaning it out and the red
pigment is just like all over my sink
and it's like I wish so badly that more
of you would release the same sponge in
like black or white or whatever nude I
don't know pink something that's not
this red color even though they're all
ten
with color like the pink Beautyblender
kind of fades a little bit when you wash
it there's like dog hair in my face the
pink Beauty Blender does bleed a little
bit but not to the degree that the red
one did and it's just scary you know
like when you're watching your sponge
and all this red stuff is falling you're
like oh my gosh i don't i almost want to
put this on my face cuz like what if it
mixes with the foundation and i apply
like red pigmy on my face i don't know
more feet we're watching please release
the sponge and a different color come on
and then the other sponge I want to talk
about is actually the Ofra sponge it has
a name cat remember like I said I love
you like a love song baby it's like in
my mind right now
during this whole video I can't stop
singing it in my head I'm so sad that I
don't like this I love Oprah as a brand
I love the owners of afro you have no
idea like I feel like Oprah is like my
family they're so family-oriented I love
them I don't love the sponge it's really
good in theory but every time I wet this
sponge and I try to like soak out the
water it stays like mushy and it stays
stuck and the water doesn't really rinse
well so I find that it applies my
foundation a little bit more wet than
any other beauty blender I use do you
know what I mean are you following am I
crazy
yeah you are crazy I know a lot of you
said that right now when it's dry it's
perfect but I mean I like to use my
sponge as wet so it was a little bit
disappointing for me not my favorite
Beauty Blender dupe out there okay and
then the last product I really
contemplated even mentioning it in this
video because I feel like I'm gonna get
some hate for it I don't want to make
anybody mad but I don't like okay now
that I don't like I'm a little bit
disappointed in the anastacio ultimate
glow kit I know I know I don't know I'm
sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I was a little
bit disappointed with this I love the
packaging I think it's so cool I think
the packaging is amazing you get an
awesome mirror you I don't think you get
a mirror in the other glow kits I love
the packaging I think the packaging is
really great quality I mean this even
glows in the dark does it get better
than that
let me see if I can show you this glows
in the freaking dark gotta turn these
lights off cuz
you can't see it okay I'm gonna try to
make this fast let's go to the dark do
you see it oh my god you can't even see
it white oh my gosh you can't see it but
I'm holding infront of the camera and
it's glowing okay that was a complete
fail the camera wasn't picking up the
glow factor you're just gonna have to
take my word for it this part the glow
kid part it glows in the dark which is
pretty cool not that anybody would be
like highlighting in the dark but the
quality of these highlights are not my
favorite maybe their intention was to
create more of a shimmery glittery
highlight but that's just not my
personal preference I've like I said
seventeen times in this video I prefer a
more sheen these are a little bit too
glittery for me let me just watch them
for you so this one this one this one
I'm gonna swatch them right now like
this oh my god anastacio please don't
hate me I love you so much you're one of
my favorite brands I really really
really love you okay those are the
bottom three colors I'm gonna grab
highlights from their other glow kits
and I'm gonna compare them okay so I
have some of the glow cape shades in my
Z palette there are obviously different
colors but just I'm just comparing the
pigmentation so I'm gonna swatch them
right next to the other ones you cannot
tell they're they're more pigmented and
they're way less glittery I will put
inserts I will give you better shots in
this video I'm just being a little bit
hard on this like you can totally make
these work but I 1,000% prefer her other
glow kits as opposed to this one I was
so excited to get this in the mail
because like I said her glow kits
they're amazing you get so much for such
a good price and the same goes with this
for six highlights it's a really good
deal I just wish it wasn't as glittery
as it is it's all I'm saying okay I'm
sorry I'm sorry a lot of sauces so much
but this was a disappointment for me
okay guys so that completes this video
these were products I recently tried out
that were just not my favorite for one
reason or another I try out so many
products and I try out so many brands
that I'm a little bit more nit picky
with things because I always think of
other products that are the same that
are way better like there's a ton of
other bronzer brushes that are way
better than that one
there's a ton of other concealers that
are way better than that one so I always
compare a product to everything else you
know what I'm saying you know you know
so yeah I hope you enjoyed this video
please don't take any offense to it I
hope it's helpful in some way maybe we
like similar things and maybe this video
will help you out
but yeah that completes this video thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
I'm frigging time I sit down to film
every time border scratches the couch
there's so many different blushes
because blushes with brushes oh you see
I don't check wait not my fake I have my
yellow and the water doesn't really rip
and the water doesn't really rinse well
that's a tongue twister how does he not
get tired
I like tyrunt hooking enemy eyes on the
dog that's the Marc Jacobs brush I
thought I stepped on Porter's little
Paul</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
