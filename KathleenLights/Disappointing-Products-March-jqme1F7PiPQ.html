another disappointing products I'm going
to try to do these monthly sometimes it
might not happen every month because
most of the times things really do work
for me or at least I try to make it work
but who know there might not always be
something bad or disappointing to talk
about but if there is I'm going to try
to do these monthly and the last one I
posted was in January I believed and we
are like halfway through March elements
so it is time to do another one like I
say in every video please don't be
offended if any of these products are
your favorites they just didn't work for
me for one reason or another they're not
bad they just they're not my favorites
okay so the first product I want to talk
about are these guys right here these
are the urban decay razor sharp long
wear liquid eyeliners they do send these
to me they sent me their entire range
and they have stunning colors these
colors are absolutely beautiful the
whole range is so nice I was so excited
to get these in the mail but the more I
played around with them the more I
didn't like them and I gave a lot of
them a shot but it seems like they all
had the same formula and the same
consistency so I knew I really wasn't
going to like the rest of them these are
just in my opinion they're too watery
for me
they're so watery unless you can't go
with that swatch it's almost like if
they poured water into each of these and
they're a little bit sheer you can build
them up you can do a few layers and then
get like pretty good pigmentation but
honestly for the price I don't want to
have to do that there are a ton of
liquid liners on the market colorful
ones that are really good not watery and
are so pigmented that you don't need to
do multiple layers maybe I got bad ones
because mine are very watery they just I
don't know I find them difficult to work
with and for that reason I don't use
them and I will not use them so I don't
I don't like them idle the new rose
highlighting palette by BH Cosmetics
these kinds of a dud for me I feel like
I talked about chunky glittery
highlights in every disappointing
product video but I'm really picky with
my highlights I like something to be
smooth and like pearly and kind of like
a sheen the BH Cosmetics palette is not
my favorite the colors are very
beautiful when you look at them but they
are very rough when you swatch them they
feel rough it kind of scribe to feel
scratchy little sandpaper like so
strange but they're also pretty glittery
at least this one is and this one
two are a little bit more of like a
sheen but the texture is so rough and
weird that it doesn't apply nicely on my
skin it's just something that kind of
sits on top of my cheek and you can see
it and when you swatch it on your finger
I mean it looks better swatched than it
applied on the skin it looks worse on
the skin but when you swatch it it's
like little chunks just like break up
and crumble off it's so weird
if you are into a very soft pearly Sheen
you will not like this so just keep that
in mind
not my favorite okay so my next product
isn't a bad product it disappointed me
because I just really can't find use for
it I don't really use it that often I
don't think it's worth the money but I
don't think it's bad you know this is
the food of beauty rose gold textured
eyeshadow pallete it's not bad I've used
it a few times and I've gotten a really
pretty look out of it but for me it's
just a little bit harder to blend than
some of my other eyeshadow palettes like
my Too Faced chocolate bar palette my
honest awesome Modern Renaissance
palette it blends beautifully those are
the little powdery and I can take that
because they just blend so well these
they're a little bit harder to blend you
can still work with them but there's a
little bit a little bit more rough and I
know how people hate these colors up
here because they don't apply really
well but if you use like 6 plus or a
mixing medium or even eye drops if you
mix it in with this these eyeshadows can
be very very pretty I don't think these
are just meant to be used like with a
flat shader brush because they're very
metallic and very soild and they just
have a different formula so you're
probably going to need to mix that with
something that doesn't bother me it's
just if I'm going to be honest
I reach for other palettes with this
color scheme versus this one like I will
always grab my Anasazi on Modern
Renaissance palette over this one I
don't think this one is nearly as good I
mean yeah it's completely different but
it has like that warm pinky tone kind of
vibe it's just whatever you know some of
you are probably like I love it and I'm
so sorry it's just it's just my opinion
I just don't think it's that great I
have to think about this one too this is
another eye shadow palette so this is
the Too Faced white chocolate chip
palette and ever since the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette came out I have
been saying the Too Faced needs to come
out with a white chocolate bar palette
it just makes sense you know they have
the regular chocolate it just
make sense but I expected it to be like
you know like something like this you
know like this size like an actual
palate you know but they released this
and this is really cute like the idea of
it is really cute I like that they named
it white chocolate chip like feeling
like a little chip so I get where they
were going with it making it small like
this but I don't like this at all like I
at all I don't like I don't I don't
fertilize a little bit smaller than I
thought it was going to be I thought I
was going to be like the size of my hand
but no it I mean okay so it kind of is
but I thought it was going to be a
little bit bigger I love that there's a
mirror and it's a really really really
nice mirror - this will be awesome to
travel with I wouldn't have a problem
with it except I think these colors are
so lackluster to me not in terms of
pigmentation but just as a palette I
can't really do much with these shades
there's a dark black which is nice but
it is glittery there's just like no flow
to this palette it's just they're all
very light shades and like the summer
matte and the summer shimmery but to me
it just doesn't flow together I also
don't like this purple shimmer one is
the pigmentation is a little weird and
chunky it's just I don't know it just
doesn't make sense to me and I crazier
would any of you have this and do you
really love it do you take it with
yourself to travel I think the idea was
great the color selection was just not I
don't think it's worth the money even
though it's not crazy expensive it just
it doesn't make sense okay so I'm going
talk about a few disappointing lip
products before we go into other stuff
the first ones I want to talk about are
the Burberry liquid lipsticks now these
are really really great if you like this
type of liquid lipsticks these are
extremely moosie like extremely movie
they're that whipped liquid lipsticks
but don't completely sit down they kind
of feel a little bit like pillowy which
I don't mind that like the overall ones
are kind of like a hybrid between a
mousse and like a really runny liquid
lipstick but for that reason I feel like
they really work for me and they last
all day and they don't feel weird or
look ugly on my lips these did not look
pretty on my list just the way that they
sat on my lips it kind of emphasized
every little dry crack texture I had on
my mouth and I'm someone who suffers
from dry lips all the time I have very
dry lips I don't have like the smoothest
most beautiful lips ever so maybe that's
why these didn't work for me
you have pretty smooth lifts I think you
would really like this even when I did
it for me I didn't like how the it sat
on my list I don't know what it was
about it and while I love these colors I
just didn't like the formula all that
much I feel like the NYX soft matte lip
creams are pretty much the exact same
and these are way more pricey that's why
I'm including them in this video
honestly because there are kind of other
brands with this kind of formula that
don't really bother me but that's that's
these were two moosie for me like too
much okay let's talk about something
that was like the exact opposite in my
last disappointing product video I was
wearing the Too Faced melted matte
liquid lipstick in the shade cause women
who and I've worn this liquid lipsticks
on like five separate occasions the
first two times I tried it on I loved it
it were all day I didn't really have
issues with it but then I wore it again
for my disappointing product video and
it was crumbling by the end of the video
I had like blue on the bottom of my chin
and then I wore it two more times after
that just to make sure because I had
worn it previously and it was fine but
mmm this is not working anymore
kind of like how my hair isn't working
anymore I don't know if it just got
dried up I don't know what the issue
with this is but it just crumbles all
over the place I think it's too liquidy
to wear it dries a little bit too matte
so that it's just like which is really
weird because I have worn the other
colours in the past like I said and that
didn't happen
I actually really love the Too Faced
melted matte lipsticks there's one that
I wear all the time I think it's called
child star I'm not sure but I love that
one it doesn't crack up on me sometimes
with liquid lipsticks like these liquidy
ones it depends on the color some of
them will be super smooth and won't
crack but some of them like some colors
just don't work with this formula and I
don't like this and it sucks because I
loved this color that was so cool like a
navy blue lid but it's starting to crack
on me and it started to crumble and I
don't like that okay and then the last
red products I want to talk about are
also liquid lipsticks I don't know I
just I try to love liquid lipsticks
Kylie metal matte lipsticks these are
the only two that I own I have been sent
some liquid lipsticks in the past from
Kylie but I've also purchased a lot of
them like this one was purchased by me
I believe this one was sent to me I'm
not exactly sure I like
her regular liquid lipsticks I think
they're really good I know a lot of
people hate them but I actually really
like them but her metal matte lipsticks
no no I don't like them this one I
actually really liked when I first got
it I thought it was beautiful I haven't
even told you the names this one is kaya
a/c and this one is air I love that it
looked nice and foiled but it looked
really natural I know I really liked it
but the more I used it more the formula
change it started to get really weird it
became kind of moose ear than it
normally is and the formulas it started
to kind of break up the more I wore it
when I apply them they look really
streaky it's kind of like the
pigmentation wants to sit on one side of
the mouth but not on the other and then
when you try to do another layer it kind
of takes off the metallic knits on one
side it's just I don't like how these
apply at all I love her regular liquid
lipsticks but I do not like her metal
matte ones I have to be honest the whole
metallic liquid lipstick trend I like it
but it's really hard formula to get
right and I think that's a Milani liquid
lipsticks that are metallic like that
are beautiful I don't really have any
problems with those and those are super
affordable but these are not really like
been more highlights I don't like these
that much these are cut this is I okay I
would consider this like a these are the
makeup revolution skin kiss highlights I
was so excited to get these because I
actually like a lot of makeup revolution
highlights like they're based ones are
beautiful they actually do look like a
nice sheen on the skin it's not chunky
or anything those I really love I love
the light pink one it's so pretty but
these I don't like them I don't like the
formula of these I have this one in the
shade peach kiss and this one is an ice
kiss now don't get me wrong the colors
are beautiful and when you swatch them
you're gonna you're like wow that's
going to look incredible
these swatch so nicely but when you
apply them to the skin I think too much
product comes off on the brush and it
kind of looks heavy on my face I'm not
clear to say that a highlighter looks
heavy but for me personally it looks
heavy it kind of looks a little thick
it's just too intense for my personal
liking these are beautiful as eyeshadows
like I'm going to keep these because I
think that things would be really cool
if I shadows but on the skin is
not my favorite and they're not glittery
like there is no glitter in this it's
actually like a really pretty sheen it's
not as smooth as I want it to be so
every time I try to apply this on my
face I don't like the outcome it looks a
little fake on my face and I don't like
that so I okay so my next product is
this freaking sponge this is the new
Real Techniques dual ended expert sponge
and considering how amazing their
miracle complexion sponge is this in
comparison is literally garbage you know
that came off a little strong but this
button is not good and I don't
understand because Real Techniques like
I said their miracle sponge their orange
one that looks just like this only
completely orange is wonderful it's
comparable for the Beauty Blender it's
so squishy bouncy is fabulous I love it
this is so stiff and it doesn't even
expand okay take a look at this do you
see it I'm about to go wet it and I'm
going to show you how it expands under
water this is what it looks like in my
hand you see it's like smaller than the
palm of my hand
you know okay I'm gonna go with it I am
running it under my water on tour I'm
squeezing it
I'm really really a whore in here this
is a sponge completely soaking wet it
stays the exact same size and I know
what some of you are thinking right now
like who cares if it doesn't get bigger
as long as it works right no that sounds
really sexual but no because the thing
is that once you wet a Beauty Blender
like it so it's soft but once you wet it
the sponge expands and it just becomes
so much softer and just ask anybody it's
a Beauty Blender is not the same unless
you wet it and it gets big and fluffy
same with the orange Real Techniques
sponge once you wet it just fluffy and
soft and it just apply a foundation so
well this is hard as a rock like who
wants to put on a foundation with this
rock I don't understand this bunch at
all I'm kind of like really baffled even
their diamond one is really awesome too
below what is being real technique would
is be east no boob I truly don't like
this lunge to me this is probably the
most disappointing product in this video
I just okay and the arrests I want to
talk about is this guy right here this
isn't really like a disappointing
product is just I don't think my skin
hate this this is the fish
formula into the ready face primer I've
tried this so many ways with like three
different foundations I even tried not
applying my morning moisturizer I've
tried it a bunch of ways but this just
pills up on my skin you know how certain
silicone II primers when you apply this
to your face and when you kind of start
to blend them out some of them will
react weird with your moisturizer and
they'll start to ball up this does that
no matter what it's extremely thick like
can you see that look at this do you see
it it's so thick no matter how I blend
it a lot of the times it will just pale
up like that and I mean I really work it
and obviously I just blended it kind of
like so so right there so you can see it
but I really work this into my skin and
it just comes up and every time I apply
my foundation on top it doesn't apply
nicely I just don't like the formula too
thick it's I don't like it and I like
that there's SPF 18 but I don't like the
formula demo so I don't see a guys those
are products that recently disappointed
me for one reason or another I know that
these videos seem really negative and
out of this here talking crap sometimes
I like to give you my negative opinion
on certain products maybe it helps you
out in some way sometimes it's not
always rainbows and butterflies its
compromise that moves us along ohh
side note before I go this is a cover
effects illuminating exciting spray I
spoke about this in my last video
briefly I had no idea this spray had
shimmer in you definitely want to make
sure that you shake the crap out of this
like I'm talking about like I didn't
know that it says shake very well before
use and they're not kidding because this
has shimmer in it and if you don't take
it up and you spray really close to your
face there will be literal dots of
shimmer all over your face I use it
earlier and it really has to go back
with a brush and just tap it in because
I had my shimmer particles on my face
like look there's one hanging out right
there he said dot under my brows
that's a shimmer particle I love you
guys thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
fuzzball you've been scared of that man
why do you did you ask me I come what
enriching like I will always grass I
always grab my Anasazi amana relative
hmm it's not always rainbows handbook
