tutorial on the look that I'm currently
wearing it is a very very very dramatic
look not extremely wearable but I love
looks like this where the eyes are
really really bold they just really make
your eye color pop no matter what eye
color you have I feel like looks like
this just make your eyes pop and I am
using the new morphe 35o 2 palette I was
so excited when I saw this because the
35o palette is one of my favorite
palettes from morphe and this new 3502
palette is so pretty it's even warmer
than the other one
not that it's like warmer they're both
very warm but this one has like really
intense pops of color here that are very
warm that I love this color is so
incredible and I really just wanted to
use this palette in a makeup tutorial
because so many of you guys were asking
me if I had tried this out yet what I
thought about it and I mean I just used
it today for the very first time but all
the colors I used were so good
this is literally like a fall palette
right here like so fall you can get so
many looks with this and I love that
there's a black the only thing this
palette really lacks for me our
highlight shades I highlighted my inner
corners with this one today and this is
pretty much as highlighting as it gets
for me at least for my skintone I would
have liked to see like one or two creamy
highlight shades but besides that this
palette is perfection I cannot wait to
play around with this even more it
inspires me so much like I look at this
and I just want to play with it so I
wanted to do something really bold and
very fallish and now I'm like really
excited for fall I was holding on to
summer for a while there I did not want
summer to end even though in Miami is it
really fall no but this totally inspires
me to just jump into fall makeup looks
so definitely let me know what tutorials
you want to see from me leave them in
the comments below what fall videos you
want to see requests requests requests
but anyway I hope you enjoyed this bold
fall makeup look and if you want to see
how to get this
then just keep watching okay so I've
already primed my eyes and now I'm
jumping into the morphe 35o 2 palette
I'm gonna take this shade and I'm gonna
use this as my crease color this is
pretty much gonna be my transition shade
to where all of the other eyeshadows I
put on top will just blend better
because we have this initial color down
so I'm just buffing this into my crease
and just gradually building up the color
I'm pretty much putting this everywhere
as you can see then I'm gonna go back
into the palette and I'm gonna take this
shader here it's a really like vibrant
terracotta color and I'm gonna start
doing kind of like a halo eye you can
see on my other eye I have that bright
orange in the middle so I'm just
building up colors around it I mean you
can put it on your entire eye you don't
have to leave the center blank but you
know that's that's just what I'm doing
and I'm taking okay so I'm taking this
shade this shade is completely pointless
in this step it's just that I did it on
the other eye when I was playing around
with this palette and I thought I have
to do it again because you know I want
to make I want to do the exact same
steps but this that part right there
totally pointless because we will cover
that I'm gonna go back into that
terracotta shade and I'm just gonna
blend the edges of this pink color so
that everything looks nice and blended
this look takes a lot and lot lots of
blending I'm going back into that first
crease shade we use and just blending
some more you know you know how these
looks are
okay so now I'm gonna go in with this
deep color I love it because it kind of
has like a purple undertone and I'm
gonna start focusing this color on the
outer corners and on the inner corners
of my eye as well and then I'm gonna
connect that in the crease I'm leaving
the center of my eye bare I like I'm not
adding any of this eye shadow on it
because like I said I will go over it
with the orange eyeshadow but I'm just
slowly building this color up it's
better to start off slow because this
color is pretty dark so I'm slowly
building that color up until it does
deep as I want it and then I'm just
going back into that crease shade blend
and blend in some more I always go back
and just make sure that everything is
nice and blended okay so since there's
no highlight shade in the palette I'm
gonna take my Catrice primum fine
contour a little kit here and I'm going
to use the highlight shade to highlight
my brow bone
now I'm gonna take the orange shade in
this palette it's like a very shimmery
beautiful fiery orange and I'm just
gonna place this directly in the center
of the lid or we didn't apply any of the
dark eyeshadow and I'm just applying
this with my finger it's just so much
easier to apply shadow with your finger
you get the best color payout that way
and now I'm just taking a brush and just
blending out the edges making sure
they're blended into one another and now
I'm just gonna move on to the face
before I finish up my eyes I'm gonna
take my Smashbox primer riser
moisturizer and primer in one I love
this primer it's so hydrating and then
I'm gonna take my number seven stay
perfect foundation in the shade warm
ivory and I'm gonna apply this with my
la girl sponge I really really like this
sponge I don't know if it's just me but
I feel like it doesn't soak up any of my
foundation like it gives me maximum
coverage and I've never really
experienced that with a sponge I don't
know I think I'm really liking it but
anyway love this foundation good stuff
and for concealer I'm going in with the
color pop no filter concealer in the
shade light and I'm just applying that
underneath my eyes and I'm also gonna
use this concealer to highlight my face
as well
to set my concealer I'm gonna take my
NYX HD powder I think this is called
banana I'm not sure but I will have it
down below as always okay so moving back
onto the eyes I didn't realize I wasn't
recording in this part but basically I
just used the first crease color we used
on the eyes and I'm just using this to
smoke out my lower lash line then I'm
gonna go back into this little reddish
terracotta shade and on a smaller brush
I'm gonna do the exact same thing but
I'm gonna focus this color a little bit
closer to my waterline then the other
color like the other one I was really
blowing it out underneath there this one
I'm just I'm doing it a little bit
tighter then I'm gonna go into the
darkest color I use on the eyes and I'm
gonna I'm gonna kind of mirror my
top lid so I'm gonna focus this color on
the outer corners and on the inner
corners as well leaving the center of my
lower lashline bare because I'm gonna
apply this beautiful orange shade tweet
to right now with my pinky oh well I
tried to use it with a brush and I was
like yeah I like it better apply it with
my finger so I went in with my pinky and
yeah oh I used this shade to highlight
my inner corners and then I went in with
my Anastacio darkside eyeliner and I
used this to tightline and I applied
this to my waterline as well to get like
a really intense black waterline and
then I went in with my Inglot gel liner
in number 77 and I'm just gonna add a
little wing I totally screwed up my
right eye as you can tell the line is
totally squiggly and crooked but my
Inglot liner was so dried out that I
struggled big-time doing my wings so
please ignore my wonky my wonky winged
liner on the other eye I apologize but
anyway I went in with some falsies and
then I applied my cookie volume and
length mascara and then boom the eyes
are done super super Fawley very
dramatic to contour my face I'm gonna
use my cover effects suntan bronzer I
love this to contour because it kind of
has like a neutral cool undertone and I
love using it to contour by the way I
love this glossier brush it came with
the water
and I like it to contour it's very
fluffy but like very thin I like it it's
not thin I don't know I just like it and
then to warm up my skin a little bit
more I went in with the LC bronzer in
the shade light I just wanted to add a
little bit of warmth to the face for
blush I wanted to keep the warm theme
and I used one of my favorite blushes in
the entire world this is the Milani warm
petals blush it just goes with so many
looks I love this blush I use it all the
time so just pop that on and then for
highlight I'm gonna take this over a
highlight this is the nikkietutorials
highlight in glow goals I applied that
to the tops of my cheekbones and on to
my nose as well and then to finish off
the look I'm going in with my lip color
I'm gonna take this mac prolongwear lip
liner in etc and I'm just using this to
line the outer rim outer rim lay up just
to line my lips like to actually line my
lips not really fill them in and then
I'm gonna go in with the Kylie cosmetics
exposed a liquid lipstick I love this
liquid lipstick it's the perfect fall
nude I love it but that completes this
