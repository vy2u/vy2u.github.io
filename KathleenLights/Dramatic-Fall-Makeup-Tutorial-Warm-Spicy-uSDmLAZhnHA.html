tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
here it's very foul appropriate are we
in volume I was about to say now that we
are officially involved but we are rare
I had to double check now it is
officially fall and I love this time of
year especially for makeup because it's
all about the warm colors and you know I
like warm colors
today's video is a fun one because it is
a collab with one of my great friends
here on YouTube Laura her name is mrs.
Lowell in on YouTube and we both had the
great idea to do a look surrounding the
Oprah long-lasting liquid lipstick in
Miami fever which you guys know is the
color I created with Oprah we thought it
would be awesome to surround our
tutorial with this color she has blonde
hair and I have well a lot of people I
would I like to think I'm blonde I like
to think I'm blonde but I'm brunette I
mean I'm a brunette
but I trick people it's like oh you're
blonde
oh you're brunette it was so highly
requested from you guys to do a bunch of
looks using Miami fever so of course I'm
doing one for you and Laura is gonna do
one for you as well she's really really
awesome and very big on energies like
when I'm around someone and the vibes
are good I just feel good and she gives
off good light anyway I don't want to
rebel I will link Laura's video below
make sure you go and show her some love
and subscribe this look is using my
morphe 35o palette this was also so
requested a lot of you guys were like
why haven't you posted a tutorial using
that and it's just because it's so
constantly out of stock I don't like to
upset anyone but I did use that palette
for this look today it's a very messy
brown smokey eye so anyone can do this
look absolutely anyone it's just really
just a messy brown smokey eye nothing
too fancy or too complicated so I feel
like I've been talking for like 10
minutes already if you want to see how
to get this makeup look right here then
just keep watching okay so I am jumping
into eye shadow since my eyes are
ready primed I'm taking this really
light warm shade in the palette I hate
that none of these have names but I mean
the entire palette is warm and full of
orange colors but I'm just taking a
light shade infant palette and using
this in my crease now I'm taking this
dark matte Brown this Brown has a lot of
red to it so it's like a very reddish
brown and I'm applying this on my entire
lid I'm going to go into this mid-tone
brown shade and on a small little crease
brush I am just applying that into my
crease just so that I can blend those
brown colors together now I'm going to
take a darker Brown this one isn't as
red as the one I used before and it's a
little bit deeper so on a flat shader
brush I am just applying this to my
entire lid just to deepen up the look I
wanted something a little bit darker now
I'm going to take this orange color and
on that same little crease brush we used
earlier I am applying this into my
crease to really really warm up the look
I wanted the crease to look like very
orange II so that is what is it and then
I just took a big fluffy brush just to
blend any harsh edges I took this
shimmery like light champagne pinky
shade and I applied this underneath my
brow bone to highlight now I'm taking a
black eyeliner this one is from NYX it's
their pleasure Lee I like saying that or
attempting to say that and I tight line
with this and then I applied it really
close to my lashes and smudged it out
with a pencil brush you can use winged
eyeliner but I wanted something a little
bit more
and smudgy looking and then I just went
right back into that deep matte brown
shade and applied applied it to my lid
all over again okay I'm going to take
this like neon peach shade and I'm going
to lightly dust this into my crease
and this is really going to make it the
look go from 0 to 100 in terms of warmth
it's really going to warm things up so
I'm going to move on to the rest of my
face before I finish up my eyes as I
usually do and I'm using the Maybelline
Baby skin Oh taking a sip of my
sparkling water but I use my baby skin
instant pore eraser as a primer and then
I'm using the Make Up For Ever HD stick
foundation I'm going to give you guys a
quick little review because you guys
wanted to know my thoughts on this I
love this it's amazing this is like the
first stick foundation that actually
works for dry skin believe it or not
because it does have like a very satin
natural finish a lot of people say it's
like a dewy finish but I find it a
little bit more at least on my dry skin
it's not as dewy it's a little bit more
like natural and this color is a shade
too dark for me I've gotten very fair
over you know the past few weeks but it
is a little bit too dark for me but
let's try to look past it I'm gonna take
my Maybelline fit me concealer and 15
fair and I'm applying this underneath my
eyes not only to hide my dark circles
but to highlight my face and I'm also
highlighting other parts of my face as
well
I'm blending all that in with my Real
Techniques contour brush
and of course to make sure that my
concealer does increase I'm setting it
with my NYX HD powder in the shade
bahnana bahnana bahnana bahnana okay so
to finish off the eyes i'm taking this
nyx eyeliner in the shade golden bronze
and i just use that on my waterline and
then i took that same crease shade we
used in the beginning of the tutorial
whoa I'm going really fast and I just
blended that under my lower lash line
and then I just used the same highlight
shade under my brow bone on my inner
corners oh okay so this eyeshadow is
magical it's one of the new Kat Von D
eyeshadows it's amazing it's in the
shade dos Doce it's amazing so I just
blended that underneath my lower lashes
and then I took that same matte Brown
and I just deepened out the outer corner
with that so I wanted like a metallic
greeny gold so I went into my anastacio
world traveler palette traveler palette
and I took the shade metallic and I
applied it to my lower lash line on my
inner tear duct and a little bit on my
top lid as well and then I just put on
some Clinique mascara and I was gonna
apply falsies but I I kind of liked how
it looked without falsies but you know
you do whatever you want
so to contour my face i'm using my
Physicians Formula bronzer in the shade
medium I think it's the bronze booster
bronzer and I think it's the medium
shade so I'm just contouring with this
but not like a very harsh contour or
anything mainly just warming up my face
and also trying to add some bronzer onto
my neck since my face didn't quite match
my neck all that much so I took off my
little Hart ears and I'm applying some
highlight this is the Becca champagne
pop highlighter and I'm highlighting my
face and I decided to highlight before
blush today and I don't know why so I
went into this elf palette this is the
light blush palette and I took the
really warm pinchy pinchy know peachy
shade and I just decided to stamp that
on my face and of course finishing off
they look with the Miami fever liquid
lipstick that completes this makeup look
thank you guys so much for watching I
really hope you enjoyed please subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
