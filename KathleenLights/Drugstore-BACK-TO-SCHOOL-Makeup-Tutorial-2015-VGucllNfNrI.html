a drugstore back to school makeup
tutorial this is the kind of makeup I
would wear to high school and it's using
none other than drugstore products and
I'm also using affordable brushes as
well it's a talk through video yeah so
if you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching ok so I've
already done my eyebrows and I used the
NYX micro brow pencil in brunette and
then I set it with the Loreal brow
stylist plumper in light to medium but
really natural with my eyebrows today if
you guys watch my videos you know you
know I like it bold brow but I went I
just followed the exact natural shape of
my eyebrow to fill in any of the sparse
areas I have a little bit of bold spots
in between so I used these two products
these are the best drugstore products
for the eyebrows I do think that no
matter what I have to fill my eyebrows
in even if I'm not putting on makeup on
the rest of my face I have to do my
eyebrows so that is what I did to get
started on my makeup I am going to get
my hair on my face
I bought this specifically for my
tutorials there are little hearts but to
me it looks like a little bear
like little bear ears I just hate having
my hair in my face when I do tutorials
so ok so I'm gonna start off with my
face when I went to high school I've
said this about a million times but I
didn't start wearing makeup until I
graduated high school until I was 18
like actual makeup in high school I
literally had the same routine every day
I put on a brown eyeliner or black
depending on how I felt that day
brown or black eyeliner in my waterline
mascara and lipstick those three things
and that's simply because I didn't like
to wear makeup that much in high school
I didn't really get obsessed with it
till I after I graduated and I could not
be bothered in the morning my mom had to
like force me out of bed even as a
senior in high school she was like like
get up I was 100% not a morning person
so I did my makeup while my mom drove me
to school every morning and it was only
three things so I got it done really
fast
but if I had to go back to high school
right now this is probably the kind of
makeup I would wear I still wouldn't
wear a foundation I would probably only
put concealer on the certain areas that
I need concealing but today I'm going to
be using my Maybelline Dream pure BB
cream I love this BB cream it's my
favorite one from the drugstore it has
salicylic acid it has salicylic acid
acne treatment in it which I find
doesn't really help my skin but it
doesn't break me out so I'm all for that
I'm using my Real Techniques sculpting
brush and I am just putting that on my
face this is in the shade light to
medium this has very very sheer coverage
but on me it doesn't get greasy
throughout the day it doesn't get
disgusting if I'm going to be completely
honest with you I would recommend
something with SPF I don't think this
has SPF especially if you have PE or
anything like that it's smarter to use a
product with SPF in it so if you are
going to use this product just put on a
moisturizer that has SPF on first and
then going with this that is what I
would do I am loving one bite OCHA at
the moment and that is not drugstore so
I'm not including it so everyone wakes
up really really early to go to school
and well we've got some dark circles
folks and we need to cover those bad
boys up I'm going to use the maybelline
instant age rewind dark circle eraser
this has really good coverage but it's
really light so I like it underneath the
eyes I have mine in the shade fair and
I'm not going to highlight or anything
I'm just gonna dab this underneath my
eyes on my dark circles and I'm just
gonna blend that out
I'm also going to bring that on to my
eyelid to help cover up the veins I have
very veiny eyelids so this is going to
help cover them up conceal it I can't
even use your fingers if you don't have
makeup brushes just dab this into your
under eyes with your fingers oh great
there's a man with a leaf blower
okay so let's ignore the leaf blower
really quick I have to set my under eye
concealer no matter what I don't set the
rest of my face with powder because I
have dry skin if you have oily skin even
normal skin
I do recommend setting your face so that
it could last all those hours you are in
school tessai my under eye concealer I'm
using the elf high definition under eye
setting powder I lost this and I finally
found it it's one of the best under eye
setting powders and it's like three
dollars
it's very brightening I really like it
using the real techniques setting brush
now my face seems a little bit washed
out a little bit just like flat there's
not much to it so I'm going to bronze
the skin and I'm going to use my ELF
pressed mineral bronzer in tan toffee
this is a great affordable bronzer I'm
taking this Real Techniques set of the
thup thup blush brush and I'm just going
to warm up Zee face I know that contour
is all the rage right now
and all that stuff but guys please don't
feel like you have to contour to go to
school please don't feel like that
please don't feel like you need to look
like Kim Kardashian in fourth period cuz
you don't I feel like um people have
this expectation that you have to look
super makeup B all the time and that is
not true I mean my eye bags were on
fleek in high school and I never
concealed them yellow I didn't have time
for that
but on the flip side do not let anybody
make you feel like you cannot wear a
smoky eye to school if you want to wear
a smoky eye to school if you want to
highlight your face put on five layers
of foundation if you want to wear that
to school do not let anybody anybody
make you feel like you shouldn't it's
just makeup it washes off at the end of
the day and if you want to go ham go ham
if you want to not wear makeup don't
wear makeup who cares society these days
um this makeup tutorial specifically is
what I would wear to high school
personally so that is why I'm doing it
this way cuz it's what I would do and
it's my tutorial you know okay now that
I don't feel like a zombie anymore all
hail bronzer I lend me some bronzer I am
going to add a little bit of that same
bronzer in the crease of my eye I would
never have done a shadow for high school
because I did not have time for that I
love getting my extra ten minutes of
sleep so just dusting bronzer in the
crease will make a world of a difference
it looks like you put a little
something-something when really it's
just a little bit of bronzer you know I
feel like doing eyeshadow takes a lot of
time and you have to concentrate
and all that stuff so I just messily
celeb bronzer in my crease and call it a
day now I'm just using this Coastal
Scents brush to get that same rounder
and just add a little bit underneath my
lashes my lower lashes now I am
completely done with my eyes just a
little bit of definition and now I'm
going to use the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I love this one
because it gives me a lot of volume and
I love having thick lashes no matter
what I do so I'm just going to add just
two thin coats of this to my top and
bottom lashes next I'm going to define
the eyes just with a little bit of
eyeliner on my lower lash line I'm not
going to tightline or anything I'm using
the gel pencil liner by NYX in brown I
just think it's a little bit less harsh
than black and then that completes the
eyes I zoomed in a little bit just so
you can see this is just a little bit of
bronzer in the crease mascara and brown
eyeliner okay so normally at this point
I would just throw on some lip gloss
lipstick whatever whatever lip liner but
I am gonna apply a little bit of blush
just a little bit of blush because I
know some people like cannot go without
blush I'm somebody who I rather just do
bronzer and that's it some people rather
do blush and skip bronzer but I'm just
going to add a little bit of this Milani
baked blush in Luminoso because it does
have a sheen to it and I cannot be
bothered to highlight to go to school
because alright so I'm just adding a
little bit of luminoso to create a soft
glow to my skin
you see and this way it looks like you
highlighted because of the sheen and the
blush watch it didn't okay and to finish
off the look I really recommend
something like this this is the elf
moisturizing lipstick in the shade in
the nude it's more of a darker a little
bit more of a brown nude but it is a
sheer lipstick and they're very very
moisturizing it almost feels like a lip
balm so I recommend something like this
because it's really easy to throw in
your book bag or to throw in your purse
and just reapply throughout the day
without even using a mirror because it's
foolproof since it is so sheer and
hydrating it's not something that you
need a lip liner with it's not something
you need a mirror with so I am just
putting this on and what I love most
about this lipstick is that eventually
it just dries down to a matte kind of
finish but it isn't uncomfortable it's
not matte it feels hydrating but it's
not glossy and I like that if this lip
color is too dark for you go with
something a little bit pinky or a little
bit peach here or more natural with
clear gloss whatever you feel
comfortable with that completes this
back to school makeup look I really hope
you guys enjoyed it leave me a comment

to go back to school or if you already
started school I might be late on this
tutorial but anyway I love you guys
