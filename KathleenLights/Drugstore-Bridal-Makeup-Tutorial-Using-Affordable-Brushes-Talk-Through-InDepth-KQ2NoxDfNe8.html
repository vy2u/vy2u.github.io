a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now of course I have had a
lot of requests in the past to do a
Bridal makeup look so I decided to do
one specifically using drugstore
products and I'm also using all
affordable brushes in this video as well
I really really love this type of makeup
and this type of look for weddings but I
mean everybody has different tastes
everybody wants to do different things
this is just my take on really soft
feminine Bridal makeup by the way I will
say this video is going to be a long one
because it is a talk through tutorial
actually had to empty on my memory card
like almost at the end of the video so I
know it's long I know so I'm sorry about
that and actually fun fact Danny and I
didn't have a wedding we couldn't afford
one when we got married so we didn't
have like a big wedding but if we would
have had a huge like wedding or like it
nice or even a small wedding this is the
makeup I would have done something very
very similar to this even though it is
drugstore I would have done something
very similar so anyway I hope you guys
enjoy this video and if you want to see
how to get this drugstore Bridal makeup
then just keep watching ok so I'm just
gonna get my hair out of my face really
quick so I'm gonna start off with
eyebrows and normally I would do this
step before coming on camera and filming
a tutorial you guys know this but I have
decided to do it on camera for the
purpose of this video I look naked
throughout this video don't I I'm going
to be using the elf instant lift brow
pencil another really good drugstore
brow pencil is the NYX one it looks
really similar to this it's in a pencil
form with a spoolie on the end you guys
know I like a bold brow but I'm going to
try to make my brows a little bit more
natural although I really do love that
look I think that a nice feminine brow
is prettier on your wedding day all I'm
doing is following the natural shape of
my brows just shading them in a little
bit darker so they look
more visible more prominent okay so they
got a little too bold alright just fill
in your brows the way you are
comfortable filling them in I am gonna
set them with a brow gel or a brow
mascara because this is not enough on
its own I don't think any brow product
is enough on its own you are gonna need
something that's going to keep it in
place
all day even if you don't have long
eyebrow hairs this is really going to
make the product underneath it stick a
lot longer I always like how I do my
eyebrows the day that I do them on
camera I hate them I freaking hate them
I'm gonna start working on my face
because the eye makeup I'm doing is
really natural and there's not much fall
out so I'm going to do all my face
makeup first
I highly recommend a primer on your
wedding day one that is really really
good from the drugstore is the NYX angel
leo
I find that my makeup does last longer
when I use this it's oil free and it is
really really really great for all skin
types but because I do have really dry
skin I'm going to add a little bit of
the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer I'm going
to mix them and I'm going to apply it to
my face like that
the foundation I'm going to be using
today is the Revlon Colorstay foundation
this is the one for normal to dry skin
because the regular I cannot use it's
way too cakey and too sheer up the
formula a little bit I am using a damp
Real Techniques complexion sponge these
are about seven dollars at Ulta or
anywhere they sell Real Techniques and
I'm going to start bouncing this onto my
skin a Beauty Blender over a sweat
sponge will shear out
the coverage just a little bit and make
the foundation look a little bit more
natural on your skin and that's what I
recommend if you are getting married not
to use a really thick and cakey
foundation because that's just not
really flattering if you need really
really full coverage then using a Beauty
Blender or a sponge like this will
really help that this is a full coverage
foundation but I am actually just
applying a shear shear layer
I'm going to drag it down my neck make
sure to drag your foundation down your
neck don't apply it straight to your
neck but um just drag it down your neck
so that everything matches better and it
doesn't look like you have a foundation
mask I'm going to go in with concealer
and you can see there I'm going to be
using our the LA girl Pro conceal you
can get this on the LA girl website la
girl USA calm or drugstore calm I
believe yes I'm going to mix these two
shades I'm going to mix natural this is
a more peachy color to counteract dark
circles and then I'm going to use creamy
beige really hate the packaging on this
for me it's hard to squeeze out product
but I'm using this product today in this
tutorial because I find that it has
really great coverage and it lasts all
day on my skin it doesn't look bad in
photography and ice I'm telling you it
lasts forever on the skin
you
just kinda a little bit on the bridge of
my nose here and on my chin I'm not
going to highlight anywhere else and I
don't want to pack on the concealer
because this is a thicker concealer so I
don't want my skin to look cakey so I'm
just blending this in with a real
techniques contour brush I would
normally go for a much lighter concealer
underneath my eyes you guys know to
brighten up under there and to look
extra Kim Kardashian II but you know for
a wedding you don't want that stark
white look underneath your eyes
especially in pictures or anything like
that
this combo just looks a lot more natural
on me so the next thing you want to do
is set your under-eye concealer because
if you don't set it with a powder it
will crease my favorite drugstore
setting powder for underneath the eyes
is the Maybelline fit me I also love
this on my entire face with this shade
specifically is for my under eye it's
1:35 creamy natural I'm using the Real
Techniques setting brush and I'm just
going to set that now the next step I
wouldn't typically do but for anybody
with normal to oily skin i highly
recommend you setting your face with a
powder even if you have dry skin it
might be a better idea to set your face
makeup because it's just going to make
it last longer I'm going to use the
Rimmel stay matte powder to set my face
but I'm going to use a very very light
layer of this sometimes I find that this
can flash back in photography and make
my skin look a little bit white by the
way this um the Revlon Colorstay
foundation I think um the original has
SPF but this one doesn't say it has SPF
at all I don't know why the normal to
dry skin one doesn't say it has SPF but
if it does or if it doesn't it does not
flash back in photography which is why I
really like it and why I would recommend
it for like wedding makeup but anyway
I'm just going to take this Real
Techniques blush brush and dab it dab it
dab it in ever so slightly and just set
my face
I never look this matte crazy okay so
now I'm going to contour my cheekbones
just a little bit personally for me on
your wedding day I don't think that came
card our card option but Kim Kardashian
structure is very flattering I'm going
to use the elf contour palette and I'm
going to use this elf mineral powder
blush brush and I'm going to dip it into
this cool tone color right here
I don't know if you can tell but they
gave me just a slight contour to this
side of my face
and I have a very large forehead so I'm
almost in a contour day so I'm just
gonna contour around the temps and bring
it to the other side and come forward
and just a little beam and then do the
same thing here I'm going to move on to
bronzing the skin i contoured but I
still want warmth back into my skin I'm
gonna use the Physicians Formula bronze
booster it's probably one of my favorite
drugstore bronzers because it's not a
flat matte shade so I'm going to use a
deli M tools 974 brush it's like a tulip
shaped brush you can get these online at
mm tools and I am just gonna bronze the
cheeks not contouring just slapping this
on my cheeks just like I said
bronzing the skin
I'm also going to bring this to my jaw
line right here okay so now I'm going to
go ahead and add a blush I think this is
a beautiful beautiful beautiful um like
wedding makeup kind of blush this is the
essence silky touch blush in the shade
babydoll I got this for like $2 at Ulta
it's a stunning pink it looks like a
regular pink in the pan but it does have
a sheen to it I'm going to use the
morphe m55 six brush this brush is about
10.9 ninety-nine and at ten dollars and
I'm just going to pop this on my cheeks
now I do recommend going a little bit
overboard not okay not overboard but
adding a little bit more blush then you
usually would because that is the first
thing to go on your skin so you always
want to apply a little bit more than you
normally would because it is going to
fade anyway so just remember that I'm
just popping it right here to the apples
swirling it around and then bringing it
back to blend everything
okay so because my face is really really
matte right now and I like glow I mean I
do have a little bit of glow in my
cheeks but I like a nice glow I'm first
going to go in with the Wet n Wild color
icon bronzer this is not a bronzer
clearly this is a blush I mean any
highlight and this is in the shade
reserve your cabana as this is the most
subtle highlight ever like the most
subtle highlight in my collection when
it comes to the drugstore but it gives
your cheeks like a glow from within so I
highly recommend this for those of you
who have large pores who have like
textured rough textured skin because
this is not going to emphasize your skin
whatsoever it's going to give you a very
subtle glow so if you like a BAM
highlight that don't go for this but
it's not going to emphasize your skin
which is what I really really like about
this I'm gonna take the elf know this is
none of these siding brush by Real
Techniques and I'm gonna lightly start
highlighting this is a stunning
highlight for brides because it is so
natural especially for those of you with
oily skin because it's not going to be
too much you're not going to look oily
you're just going to look like you are
naturally glowy can you see it it's very
subtle so I'm going to take this on the
bridge of my nose so the first thing I'm
going to do is prime in my eyelids you
want to make sure that you are priming
your lids especially on your wedding day
because you want your eye makeup to stay
in place the entire day this is the
Jessie's Girl I shadow primer so the
eyeshadows I'm going to be working with
come from two products the Sonia Kashuk
eye on neutral matte palette and the wet
wild walking on eggshells little trio
I'm going to take this eyeshadow brush
from ELF this is from their $1 line and
I'm going to dip it into this color
right here it's a nice
champagne and I'm just going to apply
this to my entire lid
I'm also going to take that same brush
with that same eyeshadow and I'm going
to apply this to my inner corner I'm
also going to take this color right here
labeled brow bone and it's a white with
a little bit of a gold chain so I'm
going to go right on top of this just to
make it even brighter I know it looks
scary right here but it all ties
together now I'm going to take this Real
Techniques domed shadow brush and I'm
going to dip it into this color right
here labeled crease it's a really pretty
um warm brown it has a little bit of a
sheen to it nothing too crazy I will be
putting this into the crease and even
though it has shimmer it doesn't look
bad but first I'm just going to start
packing it right here on the outer
corners just a little bit and then I'm
going to start dragging it up into the
crease
now I'm going to take the Sonia Kashuk
ion neutral map highlighting this a
regular shadow brush you can go ahead
and use the same elf brush this one is
from Coastal Scents it's only a few
dollars and I'm going to take this brown
right here right in the middle it's a
nice neutral brown not too warm not too
cool and I'm just going to put this on
the outer corners on my eyes a little
bit just to deepen them up a bit not too
much then I'm just going to drag a
little bit into my crease here for my
brow bone highlight I don't want
anything too stark too shimmery to bold
so I'm gonna just take the same
highlight I use on my face this wet and
wild reserve your Cabana
this is an Ecotools eyeshadow brush and
I'm just going to apply this to my brow
bone this is just going to lift the brow
a little bit okay so at this point you
can do a winged eyeliner look or
whatever if you really want to I'm not
going to do that I want to do something
a little bit softer so I'm going to take
the Sonia Kashuk palette and I'm going
to use this matte black shade right here
and we're going to use it as an eyeliner
and using a an eye shadow as an eyeliner
is just going to make it a little bit
softer and not as harsh so I'm taking
that same brush I just use to highlight
my brow bone and flipping it over cuz
it's a double-ended one and I'm going to
use this little angled one
for my lower lashes I'm just going to
take this equal tools brush right here
this is called the flat eyeliner brush
and I'm just going to dip it right into
this Brown that we put in our crease and
put that right really really close to
the waterline but to add a little bit
more definition I'm going to take the
brown that we used on the outer corners
of our eyes in this palette this one
right here this one in the middle and
I'm just going to add some to the outer
corners now typically on a day to day
basis I would just add black or brown
eyeliner but I'm gonna add a nude
eyeliner this is the Rimmel wake me up
no wake me up or do they cover the
Rimmel scandaleyes Kohl Kajal waterproof
eyeliner in the shade nude applying this
to my waterline because this is really
going to bring it up the eyes and make
them look bigger instead of using a
black which would make them look smaller
so applying a nude eyeliner is a nice
little trick so I will be applying
falsies don't feel like you have to if
you have nice luscious long lashes go
ahead and just apply some mascara I'm
gonna pile on the telescopic carbon
black mascara from L'Oreal before I go
in with falsies okay so these are the
finished eyes right here all I did was
apply mascara to my bottom and top
lashes and then I went in with falsies
and the ones I use you can see them
coats I mean they're on my eyes but they
are from ardell and they are the Demi's
okay so for my lips I would normally do
because it's like wedding makeup I would
do a lip liner a lipstick and then a lip
gloss on top so I think glossy lips are
pretty like for a bride but I'm going to
go ahead and just skip the lip liner
today because the lip liner I wanted to
use which is east end snob but by Rimmel
I don't know where it is
so I'm going to go ahead and take the
Milani lipstick in the shade nude cream
I think this is a stunning Bridal lip
color I think it's so pretty just going
to apply that on my entire lips and then
to add a nice glossy like top coat I'm
going to use the NYX mega shine lip
gloss in the shade sugar pie right yes
sugar pie it has a sheen to it so it
makes your lips look nice and juicy okay
