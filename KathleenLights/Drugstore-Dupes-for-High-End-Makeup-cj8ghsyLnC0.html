a dupe video I'm gonna be sharing with
you guys a few dupes that I have found
from the drugstore that are comparable
to high-end products now apparently the
term dupe means different things for
different people but for today's video
I'm going to be sharing with you dupes
that are either color dupes or formula
dupes so it might not be the same color
the two things might not be the same
color but they're kind of the same
formula I'm duping either the formula or
the color or anything like that anything
I feel that would be considered a dupe
so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and get
started I will not be doing any lip
dupes like lip glosses or lipsticks or
lip liners or anything like that because
I do want to dedicate an entire video to
drugstore dupes for high-end lip
products because I think that there's a
whole video of that in itself and I'm
still gathering like lip dupes so once I
get enough like once I get enough
products to make a whole video on it I
will be duping lip products but today
there are no lip products in today's
video so with no particular order I'm
just going to go ahead and get started
so I have really really been loving the
laura mercier secret brightening powder
it's completely different from the Laura
Mercier's translucent powder that a lot
of people use the translucent one kind
of has like a bone color to it while
this one is completely white it is
translucent it doesn't show up white on
your skin but it's very brightening so
you use this underneath your eyes to set
your under-eye concealer and it just
brightens the crap out of your under
eyes I really really love it and I have
found a dupe for it and it is the elf
high definition under eye setting powder
this one is a little bit glittery err
like there are glitter particles in the
elf one but I find that if you brush the
glitter away if you attempt to brush
them away they do just fall off your
face this one is a little bit more
brightening but all-in-all for the price
difference I would say that this one is
just as good okay so this next dupe kind
of really rocked my socks I'm so happy
to share this one with you guys
so this is the Mac electric cool shadow
I hauled this a while ago
and this was a limited edition color
this is in the shade pure flash um but
I'm pretty sure they still have these
electrical eyeshadows and I subscriber
who works at Mac actually told me that
they're coming out with more electric
cool I just I don't know whatever though
I bought this thinking it was gonna be
amazing and it is it's nice it's great
but it this is literally the same thing
as colour-pop literally now I don't mean
color wise although color probably has a
color identical to pure flash I mean
everything else texture this is the
exact same texture as colour-pop
eyeshadows like literally literally the
same exact formula and it's the same
exact packaging only black I believe
this cost me like $21 and this is five
books
speaking of Mac I'm just going to
continue on with Mac I purchased this
brush not that long ago I might have
held it this is the Mac 137 I bought
this because I was in Mac with my sister
and it was just staring at me and I
wanted it so bad it was just I was like
I have nothing like this and it is it's
a great brush I really love it I use it
all the time I like it to contour
because it gives the most natural
contour ever just to bronze up even
blush it's a great multitasking face
brush but then like a week later morphe
sent me this brush in the mail this is
the morphe M 500 and it's like the same
brush it feels just as soft and the
shape is almost identical my white one
like I kind of sat it like this without
noticing for a couple of hours so it's a
little bit like bent this way but
they're pretty much exact same and this
is I believe $12.99 and I paid $42 for
this I don't know what was in my
Starbucks
that day that possessed me to buy this
brush because it was 42 freakin dollars
but if you're interested in a broad
this shape which they're great brushes
but go ahead and buy the morphe one
because it's so much cheaper why did I
spend the money on this I don't know
this is the Tarte CC under eye corrector
I bought this because like a couple of
months ago I had really bad under-eye
circles until I discovered the midnight
recovery I by Kiehl's
so I decided to invest in this because
the girl at Sephora told me it was good
and this is what it looks like it's just
a salmon peachy color that you put
underneath your eyes and the peach eNOS
and the product really counteracts the
blue in your under eye circles so it
does work it is a great great product I
am NOT bashing this product at all it
works really well to cover up the dark
circles but I just find that I reach for
this one so much more this is the peak
see it's not what is good I don't know
why it came out like that this is the
pixie correction concentrate in the
shade brightening peach it is the exact
same thing it has that peachy undertone
pixie is a little bit more pricey
where drugstore is concerned but it is
cheaper than the Tarte one now some
people might like the Tarte one more
this one is a little bit more pigmented
so a little bit goes a very long way you
kind of have to you kind of have to use
a little bit more with this one because
it's not as pigmented but this one is
just so thick that I find that it kind
of creeps into the little fine lines and
it kind of creases underneath my eyes
while this one doesn't because it's a
drier formula but if you have very dry
under eyes I don't know if you'll like
this point is that they pretty much do
the exact same thing I guess it just
depends on which one you like more cuz
the Anastasia brow is my favorite my
holy Gro eyebrow product in the world
I've gone through thousands of these
little tubes I started using it even
before when it was in like that purpley
pink packaging you remember and recently
the drugstore has been stepping it up
with eyebrow products and the one that I
have found dupes this one the best it's
not an exact dupe but the one that comes
pretty close is the NYX micro brow
pencil they pretty much have the exact
same packaging pretty much identical
this has like a little pink of tubing
right here and this one is in white I
mean they didn't they didn't even try
to not be the same Nicks you know but
besides the packaging the formula is
very very similar I find that they both
have the same grip the same tug the same
exact color payoff the same exact like
white waxy kind of texture the only
difference is I find that this one I
have to apply a little bit less pressure
this one is of the glides on my eyebrows
to sell this much smoother this much
so for that reason this one is just a
little bit better but for a price
comparison I mean you can't go wrong
with the NYX micro brow pencil it's
pretty much the same thing so I don't
have the high end product with me
anymore because I gave it away because I
found that the drug store version pretty
much did the exact same thing and I kind
of preferred it but if you guys have
ever used the Too Faced glitter glue
it's amazing
to apply glitters on your eyelids or to
apply pigments but if you want to save
some money
the elf glitter primer pretty much works
the exact same way the exact same way
it's kind of ridiculous I just wanted to
quickly mention that cuz I don't have
the high end product to share with you
but okay so this is the Urban Decay
Naked palette now this on the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette are the best
palettes I have ever used in my life now
I don't have a dupe for this like an
actual like full-on palette that dupes
this but I do want to talk about certain
colors in this palette this is the
collection eyes uncovered nude bronze
palette this is actually like a UK brand
I cannot get this in the States but my
friend Serena sent this over when she
went to go visit the UK and I was blown
away with the quality of the eyeshadows
the colors are very very similar to a
lot of the colors in the Naked palette
and they pretty much have the exact same
formula the exact same texture a lot of
people say that the revealed palette by
Coastal Scents are dupes for the naked
palettes but I don't think that the
quality really compares the Urban Decay
eye shows are a lot better than the the
Nichols um then the Coastal Scents ones
at least in those palettes I don't know
about their single eyeshadows but anyway
these not only have very similar colors
this collection palette but the formula
is
pretty much the same and these are a lot
cheaper because this is a drugstore
product obviously this is six eyeshadows
and this is 12 so you get double the
product but certain colors that you love
in this you can find in this if you are
in the UK I wish we can get this
collection bread over here because they
are very good quality so I love the Mac
Paint Pots I love them I think they are
really really good painterly is the best
Paint Pot in the world I just so
happened to have rubenesque right here
this is like a orange e pinky gold color
these prime your eyelids really nicely
and they stay in place all day my
eyeshadows don't budge they don't crease
when I use this underneath but if you
want to save some money go ahead I'm
sure you guys know that this is a dupe
for it but I didn't want to mention it
because I think they're pretty much
exactly do these are the Maybelline
Color tattoo 24 hour eyeshadows they are
pretty much the exact same thing as
Paint Pot I don't have an exact color
dupe to any of them but if you're
looking for something similar to this
where it's a cream eyeshadow that sticks
your eyelids and doesn't move
save your money on the Mac ones because
the Maybelline ones are just as good and
you can find a lot of amazing colors
okay so this is a color dupe this is not
a formula dupe whatsoever they are 100%
150% different formulas but it is a
color dupe which is nice
this is the ever-so-popular Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in the
shade opal everybody under mama loves
this one even though I prefer moonstone
this one is a lot more popular I think
and everybody loves it and and I kind of
like the cheaper color even more this is
the color pop super shock cheek
highlight in the shade wisp I have been
wearing wisp non-stop and you can't
really tell in the packaging but these
colors are so similar when you do swatch
them they do look a little bit different
because the formulation
one is a creamy texture and one is a
powder but on the cheeks I really cannot
tell the difference actually wisp is a
little bit more intense which is
probably why I like it a little bit more
but the colors are so so similar it's
kind of crazy these are eight dollars
and these are like 40 bucks this is one
of my favorite liquid eyeliners of all
time this is the Kat Von D tattoo liner
in the shade
trooper it's a very very black eyeliner
and has a curled calligraphy style
Portage's apart
it has a calligraphy style pen it's not
a felt tip I've actually prefer these I
think they're easier to work with than
felt tips and you rarely come across a
pen
that isn't felt tip so I thought it was
really unique I love this eyeliner I
will continue to repurchase even though
I have found a dupe that is exactly the
same this is the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner in black I actually have a
whole video where I demo both of them I
put one on one eye and I put one on the
other eye and you cannot tell the
difference I will link that video down
below they both are amazing I don't have
anything negative to say about either
one but if you want to save money I
would just go ahead and go ahead I would
just go ahead and go ahead with these
Jessie's Girl one so recently I have
found that I prefer the Mac what are
these codes mineralize blushes over
their powder ones just because I think
they look so healthy on the skin they
give a nice Sheen I like the formula so
much more I love baked products
I love these this is in the shade new
romance even though I'm not talking
about the shade today has nothing to do
with the shade but Mac warm sole is a
very popular one and it is a mineralized
blush I think they're so beautiful and I
have found that I get pretty much the
exact same effect using these Mahna
Mahna nee Milani baked blush is this
isn't a color comparison comparison at
all not a color dupe because obviously
this is peach and this is pink but I get
the same effect like every time I grab a
Milani baked blush I feel like I am
putting on a Mac mineralized blush on
and they both last the exact same amount
of time on my skin like I have noticed
that neat I mean I haven't tested them
both out on both cheeks but I find that
these don't fade
throughout the day you know what I mean
I think they're both really great
because they both have amazing formulas
the formulas are almost identical so I
really wish Milani would come up with
more of them because the only one that
really suits my skin tone when I'm fair
is Luminoso the other ones are too dark
for me so I really wish they would come
out with like a warm soul tube how
amazing would that be huh okay two more
products to share with you I will be
doing these videos more sparingly like
more often so yes don't worry about that
this is the hourglass mineral primer
oil-free mineral veil primer and I
rarely use this on my channel because I
don't think it's as as amazing as like
everybody says it is it's a great primer
it's ridiculous how much I spent on it
ridiculous I should have bought it like
at all but anyway I do like it I think
it's good it does prolong my makeup for
a really really long time which is
awesome but I find that my NYX angel
veil primer is so similar and I honestly
prefer this one more this one makes my
makeup last a little bit longer but I
find that this one is a little bit more
hydrating than this one is they both
have that white milky consistency and
when you spread on your face it no
longer looks white they are both
oil-free and they are both very very
very similar in consistency but I just
prefer this one also this one has SPF
and it has a physical SPF in it which is
great but sometimes can cause a light
flashback in photos while I don't have a
problem that problem with this one
but they both blur my pores really
nicely they both pretty much the exact
same thing this one just prolongs my
makeup a little bit more but I just I
like this one more to be honest and then
the last thing I want to share with you
is very I think it's a formula tube it's
not a color do but these are the bobbi
brown shimmer bricks and I used to hate
these I thought they were so
ridiculously overpriced I didn't really
like them until I discovered pink pink
quartz and I loved it for like a
straight month that's all I would wear
and then I decided to go and buy like
all the other Bobby Brown ones but I did
get these on sale at Namie's on I like
all my Bobbi Brown shimmer bricks I've
bought them at IMATS for like half off
or 40% off this is a highlighting powder
a shimmer brick this is in the shade
bronze too
this is a bronzer like a very shimmery
bronzer but for dark skin tones it's a
beautiful highlight it's basically like
a little palette in one where you get
five strips of different colors and you
could swirl your brush in this and mix
all the colors together to get a really
pretty color or you can use them
individually as eyeshadows or anything
like that the Physicians Formula shimmer
strips are the exact same thing this is
my favorite drugstore highlight in the
entire world actually this isn't the
shade Miami strip I stay close to these
colors on the bottom because the top is
obviously too dark for a highlight now
obviously the colors are completely 100%
different but I find that you can pretty
much do the exact same thing as five
strips you can use them individually as
eyeshadows or swirl them around and get
a nice color I would only recommend the
Bobbi Brown ones over these if you like
the color selection in these more but in
terms of what they do like what they're
supposed to do they pretty much do the
same thing so I would just go ahead and
say save your money and go for the
shimmer strips shimmer strips from
Physicians Formula okay so that
completes this video I hope you guys
enjoyed these drugstore dupes for
higher-end products thank you guys so
