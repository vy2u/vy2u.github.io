Target and I originally went in free
foundation and of course came out with a
couple things more and I just wanted to
show you guys the first thing I picked
up was this Olay Total Effects 7 it hid
myself seven in one blemish control so
acidic acid acne cleanser and I've used
this twice and I already am all obsessed
with it
um I had to get a face wash because I
have the call it the Cetaphil wash for
like sensitive skin and all that a lot
of people like that but oh my god I hate
it so much I feel like it leaves a film
on my face and I noticed that my skin
like nothing was happening after I was
using that wash my skin wasn't improving
or anything like that I just I don't
know if it's a poster from your skin or
not but it was doing absolutely nothing
special to my skin so I wanted I pick
this up and I've used it twice already
and I swear I see a difference and I've
only used it twice it has like these
tiny little like not beads it's not at
all a scrub or like an exfoliator it has
like these tiny tiny like microbeads
that you kind of feel as you like as
you're washing your face and my skin was
so soft after I use this you have no
idea how soft my face was I was like
tight I cannot stop touching my face
last night after I was using it it was
crazy how soft and how much I love this
already next thing I picked up was umm
this L'Oreal total repair 5 damage
erasing balm it says deeply repairs and
reconstructs dry chemically treated hair
which is me I have originally really
really really really dark brown hair and
I'm in the process of kind of going
blonde that's why I have like this weird
like Shania Twain highlights and kind of
like brassiness going going on because
I'm trying to like go blonde the safe
way that's a safe way but the less
damaging way like I've been lightening
my hair to avoid it a little bit little
over time to try to go blonde which I'm
not even sure if I want to anymore but
but I picked this up and smells
oh my god it smells so good it's like a
yellowy a yellowy cream and it says it
repairs up to one year of damage in one
use mmm I don't know about that but I
did use it last night for the first time
and I was amazed that how soft it made
my hair usually when ever I wear like
these like masks I put it in my hair my
hair feels soft but the second that I
rinse it off like my hair is not soft
anymore like the water rinses it off and
it's not a soft it stayed completely
soft after the water head rinsed off all
the product I was like none of them
there still has to be a product in here
because my hair cannot stay this soft
after that I was amazed I really really
loved this I even prefer it over my red
can extreme builder plus I think it's
called this is like taking place of that
and I love that stuff so I'm really
excited to continue to use that okay the
next thing I got was this Monistat like
chafing relief powder gel I know that
that sounds really gross but I've heard
a lot that this is a great primer it's
silicone base and I kind of have like
all the ingredients that the poor
professional the professional one has
Oreo is it the Smashbox
I don't know primer it is but it was
cheap and they say it's a dupe so I had
to grab it and try that out yeah the
next thing I got was this color tattoo
it's from that new metals collection I
don't know if it's new it's been around
for a while but I got barely branded and
it is like that Shane champagne-y color
one it's like a pinky champagne color I
don't know if you can you'll be able to
see that it's like they say it's a dupe
for Mac's bear study Paint Pot so if you
know what that looks like this is kind
of similar um I love it I'm wearing it
under my eyeshadow right now and I love
it I originally went to go look for a
pomegranate Punk I think that's what
it's called
like the purpley cranberry one but they
didn't have it which broke my heart but
I think this one up instead and I'm so
glad I did I love these the next thing I
got with this Maybelline fit
concealer that's been around for ages
but I've heard so many good things about
it so I picked it up I'm a little I
don't know because this is the lightest
one they had and even that I really like
my under-eye concealer to be super light
and this isn't even all that light it's
the lightest one and it's almost like I
don't know I'm not I haven't tried this
out yet so the next thing I got was this
Maybelline master precise liquid
eyeliner and soon it's the one that
comes in the pen I got this because I
really love their like master line I
guess I have the the eyeliner
that's like 24 hours whatever and it's
really black and I love that stuff
so I decided to pick this up I'm not a
fan of the liquid liner that comes like
with a brush I totally suck at that I
look like I have a raccoon eye after I
used it so I like hens so I picked this
up the next thing I got I got two elf
products I got this shimmering facial
whip and I really only picked it up
because a lot of people said that it was
a dupe for the benefit high beam I don't
know how how true that is because I've
never really compared them side by side
but I've seen swatches online and they
seem pretty similar I love how this
smells I don't know if people would hate
that but it smells like oranges like an
or like a popsicle I'm not even kidding
this is probably a lot thicker than the
high beam um but for a dollar I mean you
really can't beat that I don't know if
you can see that probably can't son like
white as a ghost right now yeah I think
that and then I picked out my favorite
gel liner in the entire world and it is
the elf
cream eyeliner it comes in this little
package right here it comes with a
little brush but I mean I don't use that
I mean it's not a bad brush but it's
just so little I don't know I don't
really use it I love this Jo liner and I
feel like I hardly hear anybody talking
about this I'm a people like the L'Oreal
liquid lacquer
the Maybelline eye studio one but this
is so black and I promise you this does
not smudge at all um my sister was likes
watching it on her on my old one my
sister was using my I had my old one
here somewhere that I've already
finishes my second one she likes um
swatch it on her hand and then she wants
it like rub it off her she's like oh
this isn't coming off it does not smudge
it literally stays on all day mist
three dollars like this is the best Jo
liner hand found check it out you will
not be disappointed and then finally the
last two things I got were foundations I
didn't know which one I wanted I knew
that I had wanted to check out the
Revlon nearly naked and the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi and then I was like stuck
there for like an hour trying to figure
out which one I wanted I was like oh my
god I don't know they both have okay
they will have SPF 20 and I know that
this one you know it's everybody talks
about it but then everybody kind of
talks about this one too I have really
dry skin like crazy dry skin especially
now with the weather um
like my skin flakes off it's really
gross so I don't know I kind of wanted
to pick something up with like a dewy
finish so I decide I was like you know
what just get them both just just get
them both so I haven't tried out any of
these yet but I have high hopes I mean I
heard a lot of good things about this
one I'm not sure I don't know I don't
know but I'll let you know what I think
about these but these are the two
foundations I picked up and yeah that's
pretty much everything I got at Target
it wasn't a super huge haul but you know
it was a haul so um let me know if you
have any of these products and if you
like them or hate them I would love to
know if they work for you or if they
don't um oh you weren't bored to death
watching this and I'll see you in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
