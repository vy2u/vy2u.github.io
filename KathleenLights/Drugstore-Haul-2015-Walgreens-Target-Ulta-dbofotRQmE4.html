coat right now I don't know I was
feeling the baggy so today's video is
going to be a drugstore haul everything
in this haul is drugstore I went to Ulta
Target and Walgreens I was actually on
the hunt for the new rim Oprah baccala P
so that's why I went to so many places
and I finally found them at Walgreens
but yeah I promise you guys in my last
haul since I did like a really big
high-end haul like super high-end stuff
that I was gonna do a drugstore haul
because I want to try out a bunch of new
things that just came out at the
drugstore and yeah but I am like on a
serious no buy after this like I'm not
even joking you probably won't see a
haul on my channel for a long time not
gonna like I'm on a noble add to this so
anyway let's get started I might as well
just show you guys the pravakar lips
that I got since I did find them and I
bought six of them because I'm excessive
like that so this is what they look like
I'm really excited because since liquid
lipsticks are like all the rage right
now the drugstore I feel like it's gonna
step up their game and coming out with
liquid lipsticks so the only other brand
besides Rimmel is L'Oreal L'Oreal came
out with like their own versions they
kind of look just like this but they
were $12 at Walgreens and I was like man
that's pretty pricey for L'Oreal these
were only eight I decided to try these
instead I'm not like a huge fan of
L'Oreal to be completely honest with you
I think that they're like super
overpriced and don't get me wrong I buy
high-end makeup all the time but the
drugstore is the kind of place you want
to go especially if you're on a budget
and you don't really want to pay like
almost $13 for one lip product when Mac
is like 15 that make sense I got this
one in skinny dipping I got this one in
pucker up heartbreaker
kiss fatal or kiss fatale I don't know
make your move and little minx I will
show you like hands watches I'm not
going to swatch these all right now but
I've actually haven't even tested any of
the lip products I got
I just got back from the drugstore right
now so let me open this one and the
reason why I got six of them is because
I actually saw um it's Judy time do a
review on them and she really liked it
like these stayed on her lips all day so
I was really impressed okay moving on I
feel like I was on that product for like
20 hours I also got this this is from
Maybelline and it is called their master
graphic eyeliner in striking black seems
super gimmicky to me but I wanted to try
it out I haven't heard anybody talking
about it yet and it looks like a fat
marker but the tip is literally like a
marker so it's supposed to be really
easy to like make that cat eye because
it's slanted like that
I will definitely you guys know I'm a
huge fan of the eye Studio line from
Maybelline but I have a feeling that
that's I don't know but I want to get it
I wanted to get it just cuz you know I
could be proven wrong
also from Maybelline I picked up this
dream pure BB cream eight and one beauty
balm this one has 2% salicylic acid
which I love salicylic acid um so yeah I
wanted this just like for an everyday
kind of thing I don't know I haven't
even tried the original I here this
one's better than the original but I'm
gonna give it a shot who knows my hair
is a mess ignore my hear it is a mess oh
I got another batiste dry shampoo this
is like my favorite dry shampoo ever and
I love I've been trying out different
sense but fruity and cheeky cherry is my
favorite okay so more lip products these
are actually really new I didn't know
that the Fergie line like expanded when
I was at Walgreens like there was so
many more
Fergie stuff out so they came out with
these things called the wind wild velvet
matte lip colors from the Fergie line
and I picked up five of them
I don't even know if they're good but I
picked up five of them and this is what
they look like they look like oh no wait
I picked up four of them not five this
is not part I want to see how these
compared to like the NARS Velvet Matte
lip pencils so I got timeless chick
transcendence a DJ doll and plum plunge
in you plunge Enya alright let's open
these I've never even swatch these this
is what they look like they just look
like regular oh it's really really
smooth and that color is beautiful
this one is timeless chick so it also
has it's like a wind-up kind of thing so
that's good that you don't have to
sharpen this so yeah I'm really excited
to try this I love wet and wild these
were really inexpensive these were $3
each and wet and wild is one of my
favorite drugstore brands and these are
really pretty they're nice and sleek I
like the packaging and I really like the
Fergie line from what I've tried so I
got that I love lip products like I
can't get enough I'm just going to show
you the other two things I got from the
Fergie line since we're already talking
about that this isn't new at all but
every time I walk by this I'm like that
is so something I would like this is a
palette from the Fergie line and it has
five eyes shadows and it's called
centers no this is the center stage
collection in it desert festival and
doesn't this just look like something I
would love it has an orange a matte
Brown a nice shimmery copper a tan color
and like a dark brown I thought this
would be a really nice like orange II
look or and then I saw this this is
brand new it says new on it this is a
palette like a full-blown palette from
the Fergie line at what a wild so I'm
really excited I actually don't really
know how great the Fergie line eye
shadows are hopefully they're good
because this is a really cool palette it
comes with a brush and this brush is
actually really nice like it has a
crease brush that is super soft and then
the other side is just your typical flat
shader brush and usually with palettes
at the drugstore they have like the
little sponge applicators that a lot of
people throw away but this one is
actually
nice brush like if you see this at the
drugstore pick it up I mean from what I
can see is the first time watching them
they're swatching actually pretty decent
honestly I feel like the drugstore lacks
palettes like this and I was not a fan
of the Maybelline the nudes palette I
thought it lacked pigmentation big-time
so this is amazing it comes with a bunch
of different shades they also have one
that's like more purpley it has like
smokier colors and purples but you know
me I like my golden a neutral I got this
lip liner from covergirl because I've
never tried their lip liners before so I
just bought one to give it a shot I
really love the Jordana lip liners and
they're like a dollar each so I just
want to see if like this is any good I
don't know if this is new it just as
covergirl LipPerfection and I got mine
in the shade smokey intense
it feels really smooth and honestly the
reason why I got this is because it
looked really similar to my Mac etc lip
liner and I wanted to see if it was a
dupe you know just to include in my dupe
video but I'm not sure I have to wear it
I have to see them side by side and
stuff so I got this lip liner in smokey
intense I picked up another Maybelline
fit me foundation this is the regular
one I got mine in 1:20 because I have
this one in 220 but it's my like
self-tanning shade so I could only wear
this when I'm self-tanning and I wanted
to buy this to mix it with the new fit
me in 1:20 this is the matte and
poreless version so I really really like
this foundation so far but I have to
hydrate my face and like use like a
lumen ating primer in order for it to
look good and not cling on to the dry
patches but I feel like these two would
be a match made in heaven to get like a
natural finish for me because this is
very dewy like the original is very dewy
so I think that would be like the
perfect combo thing with Maybelline fit
me I got a fit me concealer in the shade
35 deep this is super dark but I got it
to contour I see my friend Gaby using
this to contour all the time not this
exact color but this
is the only dark color that they had so
I don't even know if this would be a
good contour shade for me but I see her
using this all the time to contour and
it blends out so amazing so I want to
give it a try I picked up this guy from
Target this is the from like the pixie
line and I got this as the correction
concentrate I haven't been sleeping and
my under-eye circles are like in tense
these days so I wanted to see if this
was any good this is like one of those
salmon toned concealers that are
supposed to correct like the blue purple
colors underneath your eyes and then you
put a concealer on top you know so you
put this first cover up your dark
circles and then you can like highlight
and do all that stuff so I wanted to see
if this was any good I have the Tarte CC
one I want to see if this is a dupe if
this is as good or if this is better you
know so I picked that up from pixie I'll
just show you the rest of the stuff I
got at Target so I got a couple of Sonia
Kashuk things literally just two things
I got this is another um what is this
crayon like a matte velvet crayon and
this is in the shade mulberry nude I've
heard Emily Noel talk about these and
she says that she really likes them
Wow my hair is all that so I wanted to
try it out I want to see if the wet and
wild ones are better because they're
cheaper so we shall see yeah they kind
of have the exact same packaging very
similar to the NARS ones I hope they're
like dupes and they last as long as the
NARS ones too so yeah like I said this
is in Mulberry nude and it's just like a
really pretty berry color and then I got
this I haven't heard anybody talk about
this at all
so I decided to just take the plunge and
try it out this is the Sonia Kashuk chic
luminosity highlighting stick in the
shade Persian sunset this is the only
one they had I wanted like the golden
ear color but they didn't have it so I
got this it looks like this is just like
a stick highlight and when you take it
off it looks like this and has I got a
cap on the top oh and then it
Scrolls or twists up huh
mine is broken and this is what it looks
like it's really smooth it's a pinky
color what huh yo come here no no I mean
I'm actually not a fan of this like it
just kind of blends out into nothing
pigmentation is a little lacking I don't
know um on display at Walgreens there
were these like new jumbo eyeshadow
sticks from the Kate Rimmel like Rimmel
Kate version panic when Wilde has Fergie
and Rimmel has like Kate Moss so I
picked up three of the colors I love
these um these like jumbo things like
that so I picked up this one in pure
turquoise it's such a pretty like
turquoise Jade shade oh that's nice
Electric sapphire a super pretty royal
blue and then rose gold these make
amazing shadow bases and they're so
expensive so picked up three of those I
got another one of my favorite scrubs in
the entire world this is like one of my
Holy Grail skincare products and it is
the st. Ives green tea scrub and they
completely change the packaging which
worries me tremendously because mine and
my packaging is a lot smaller so they
made it bigger and mine says a blemish
clearing on the front it says blemish
clearing green tea scrub and now it says
blackhead clearing green tea scrub
clears blackheads and calms redness
that's so weird so before it was blemish
clearing and now it's blackhead clearing
which I don't know about that I got this
also from Rimmel this is the lasting
finished primer I'm like on the primer
kick and you guys know that like I'm
like buying primers nothing right which
is ridiculous I don't need this many
primers but the reason why I wanted to
pick this up is because it said increase
foundation wear for up to eight hours
and I was like hmm I don't know about
that I'm always like skeptical about
that kind of thing so we shall see if it
really does prolong my makeup then
that's amazed
and it's so inexpensive - I got more lip
product huh I got another one of these
covergirl lipsticks they came out with a
bunch of new ones they have red ones
like in the red packaging those are
their red lipsticks in the pink
packaging those are the pink lipsticks
and the purple packaging you know I got
this one this is like their nude
packaging it's a new dish color and I
wasn't blown away by this but I really
love mine and tempting toffee so I
picked this one up this one is sultry
sienna and this is what it looks like
it's like a really pretty like you know
I don't know it's really really pretty
so I don't know I picked it up and then
I picked up this guy right here you guys
know that these maybelline creamy matte
lipsticks are my favorite lipsticks at
the drugstore like literally the best
lipsticks I have ever tried at Dirk's
are and I didn't have this one this one
is craving coral and I thought that this
would be so pretty in the summer time so
I picked that up I love like hot orange
e Coralie red shades like that and then
I got this this is a little iOS and I
hate us cos the commercial says cos
these eels balls because I don't like
them - like moisturize my lips because I
don't feel like they're hydrating at all
at all
they suck for that but they're great
lipstick primers because they're kind of
waxy so they have like a waxy slip to
them so I like applying this before
putting on like super drying lipstick I
love it for that and I completely ran
out of my green one so I picked up this
one it's cute it's like pink and stripes
and it's coconut milk which let's see
let's see if it does smell like coconuts
cuz I look open it oh my god
Wow that does it smell like coconuts
holy crap it's so cute like it oh this
one put you right here
mmm and then the last things I got were
nail polishes I went nail polish crazy
crazy I got some Essie nail polishes
which I don't even like the brand se
because they chip like so fast on me but
yeah I bought four of them I got this
one in the shade in the Cabana I already
have it but mine is like down to here
really gross and goopy so I got another
in the Cabana I got this one because
this is so pretty I haven't even seen it
I know it's not new it's called the more
the merrier it's like the cutest spring
color like for the spring and summer
it's a nice green none of these are new
I think I got this one which I've never
seen before this is called nice is nice
and I love these like muted grey purple
shades get that one and then I got this
one this is old too but it's called
beyond cozy and I love nail polishes
like this for like an accent nail and
then I got two more nail polishes this
one is from Orly and it's a really
pretty dusty purple so nice this one's
called Country Club khaki so pretty and
then I got this one in this from OPI OPI
is my favorite nail polish brand ever
besides the formula x ones and this
one's in going my way or Norway so
really pretty like leather camel color
and I don't have any nail polish like
this okay guys so that was everything I
got at the drugstore when a little
hanging out I got a lot of lip products
because I do I can't help it I will
definitely be doing a video like
drugstore dupes for high-end products

products to share with you guys so yeah
