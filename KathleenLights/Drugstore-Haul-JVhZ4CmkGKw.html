guys I didn't go crazy but I picked up a
couple of things I was at the NEX like
two days ago um the next is a navy
exchange it's a store on base I don't
know if I've mentioned it before but
Danny's in the Navy my husband and it's
like a giant Walmart in the sense that
there's cosmetics and electronics and
clothes and food and stuff like that so
it's kind of like a Walmart type store
and it's called the Navy Exchange yeah
yeah yeah and in our Navy exchange I
know that it's different like around the
world we have Smashbox and bareMinerals
also at the store so I did pick up
something from Smashbox and I know that
that's not drugstore but I only picked
up one thing that was high-end so I
didn't want to like add that in the
title or anything yeah so I picked up
the smash bat Smashbox smash max mm-hmm
so I picked up the Smashbox soft box and
it's just a palette like an eyeshadow
palette and I don't know this won me
over was the packaging like look cute I
don't know I'm like a sucker for like
the sleek black you get me and it just
looks like this when you open it has a
giant freaking mirror hello anyway yeah
I really loved this because I've been
looking for that perfect Toby kind of
color and I don't know if you saw my
drugstore haul when I went to Ulta and I
picked up this NYX um palette and I said
that I really liked it because of the
taupe color in there and it ended up
being the worst color in the palette it
was so chunky and chalky it oh and these
my own pieces the word I'm looking for
the worthies swatched and like on a
caffeine high right now
hmm these swatched really nice at the
store they have like you know samples
for you to swatch them and let me just
give you a little close-up so this is
the close-up of the pallets I absolutely
love this color right here and what's
great about it is that it has three
matte shades and three like shimmery
shades it doesn't have any glitter which
I really like and I just think it's
really nice and this is what they kind
of look like swatched I mean they look a
lot nicer under primer but they are
really pretty this is that topi shade I
was talking about and it looks really
nice I haven't tried it on my eyes but
I'm excited to learn about it focus it
also comes with this little brush that
is actually really really nice I know
you can see that it has like just a
regular eyeshadow brush anytime you get
a brush that I think this would be
really cute for like not really cute
really good for like you know getting
getting all up in there so I like that
so that's the only thing I got that was
high-end that's what I got from my box
okay
so before I get into it I kind of went
mascara crazy at the next um my favorite
mascara in the entire world is the
Clinique lash w mascara and it is about
to dry like it's it's hanging on for
dear life right now but I should throw
it away already but it is $14 and
there's not a clinic down the street
from me and stuff so the other day I
bought a mascara and I absolutely hated
it I had bought the wait a while on mega
plump and it's so cute because it's hot
pink and its really nice but it sucked
and I thought that I would like it
because I'm in love with the white and
wild mica valium this is my favorite
drugstore mascara of all time it's
amazing it's two dollars so I thought
that maybe the mega plump would be good
but it was so bad it did nothing like I
didn't like that Mommy did nothing so I
picked up three mascaras and the only
one I've tried out out of the three is
the Rimmel scandaleyes I remember I
tried it once a while ago and I really
really did like it this is definitely
one of those
Chara's that's a little bit better after
it's been open for a week or two because
I feel like at least for me it was a
little bit wet when I had first used it
but I actually did really really like
this so I picked that one up just have a
safety net because these next two I've
never tried before I picked up the
colossal volume Express from Maybelline
and I've heard really good things from
all the volume express mascara i but i
am the only one i've tried is the
maybelline one by one and I absolutely
hated it I didn't like it at all I'm not
a fan of rubber brushes and that one is
a rubber brush so that's probably why I
didn't really like it but I've heard
really good things about this one and I
hope I like it so I picked that up too
and then the last mascara I picked up is
kind of weird for me because I never buy
lengthening mascaras I just gravitate
towards volumizing mascaras and that's
all I ever ever get when I picked up the
Maybelline in legal length one because I
thought that maybe this would be good to
like layer under or over you know
volumizing mascara so I'm gonna give
this a try and all our people hated it
and a lot of people loved it but I'm
going to give it to go I went lippies
crazy literally the rest of the things I
bought wrong lip products I except two
things that I'm going to show you now
but I went lick crazy I don't know what
I don't know I also picked up the
walking on eggshells trio from Wet n
Wild and everybody has this I know but
they said that this color right here the
one that's labeled eyelid is a dupe for
um stealers kitten and I have had my eye
on that eye shadow for like the past
three weeks I need the kid eyes shadow
from Stila I want it so bad and I heard
that this was a pretty close dupe so I'm
going to try that out this is yeah I got
that so the next thing I picked
I've had mine for a long time ever since
I got my L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation which by the way is my new
absolute very foundation I love you so
much
yeah so I picked up the magic lumi light
infusing primer and I picked it up to
use it as a liquid highlight not to use
it as a primer because I heard that
people said as a primer it wasn't
amazing but as a highlight it was and I
don't know about you but I feel like the
drugstore the only thing it's really
lacking in is liquid highlights
I bought the elf shimmering facial whip
because it was supposedly a dupe or did
I say that weird because it was
supposedly a dupe for um benefit high
beam and then I used it and it felt like
really really sticky lip gloss so I
don't want to put that on my face so I
picked this one up which I've never even
watched this before I just opened it and
so yeah I picked this up to use this as
a highlight oh well that's nice I don't
know if you can tell I like highlights
that give you more of a glow as opposed
to like a shimmer so that's why I've
been on the hunt for a really good
liquid highlight and doesn't really have
like a like a smell or anything so
that's good so yeah it does have a
little glow enos to it so I'm really
excited to use this I hope it looks nice
anyway now into my lipstick thing that I
got okay if you've been watching my
videos you know that I've been obsessed
with jumbo lip pencils lately because
I'm super late in the whole jumbo lip
pencil thing so I picked up two more
this one's covergirl and this one is a
red long one this is the Revlon just
been possible bomb staying in honey and
I absolutely love these because they're
a stain okay but I really like the
covergirl one too because they feel more
glossy and shiny so this one's honey
swatches which I'm sure you've seen what
it looks like but that's what it looks
like swatch it's kind of a Mavi pink
which I really like that one's called
honey and then I picked up blush twists
and I really really hate that the name
isn't on the actual packaging of these
things it's on like the clear plastic
wrap that comes around it these are
definitely a little bit more sheer than
the Revlon just bitten ones but they're
really really glossy and moisturizing oh
can you see that yeah so it's like mommy
I'm just a little more so yeah it's like
a pink a light pink yeah that's really
the only way to describe this is like
okay the next thing I picked up were two
of the Maybelline Color whispers and I
don't own any of these these were the
two first ones I've ever purchased and I
actually went to go by I think it was
tutti frutti it was a Revlon lip butter
that I really wanted then I saw these I
had seen them before but I was like and
then I liked their packaging a little
bit more I know that's really stupid but
I like cobby's look and they're skinny
and they say whisper and it's really
stupid but that's that's how I am so I
picked up a pinky or one and a coral
layer one and this one's called petal
rebel and Oh cute like I said and this
one is just a light baby pink and I love
it so much because these are so pretty
that's like a beautiful what I have like
stains from like when I just watched the
eyeshadow and the other the honey that I
just watched it was a stain and
literally like stained my hand in that
second that i swatched it but anyway
this is what it looks like
it's called petal rebel I love it it's
just like that perfect baby pink for
everyday and it's actually pretty
pigmented I really like that this one's
called um coral ambition this one's cool
just I love it
my god that's beautiful that's like I
feel like it's almost like a neon peach
I don't know if you can tell but I love
it so much I'm gonna go pick up some
more because these are so beautiful well
okay so I only have three more things to
show you
and they're all from that of course we
don't need that anymore and they're all
wet and wild lipsticks now I add a huge
white a wild lover but I've never picked
up any of the lip I'm like trying to get
something by the way if you're wondering
what I'm doing I never picked up any of
the lipsticks because I I don't know
anyway
so the other day I picked it up this
what I want on lipstick called
within these adobe walls which I really
really hate the name because I don't get
it but I was so this is like really
cheap packaging but it's a great
lipstick it was so smooth and
moisturizing my lips were chapped and
you couldn't even tell that my lips were
chapped which is really really important
so after I tried that when I was like oh
my god I think I'm gonna try the
megalast lipsticks that everybody
everybody raves about that they're
really good so I picked up three of them
and um I didn't pick up any of the light
colors because matte lipsticks that are
light tend to look a little chalky on my
lips like tend to look cakey on my lips
so I do love matte lipsticks but I love
dark matte lipsticks because I feel like
they look amazing and this is insanely
difficult to open and I feel like I'm
about to break it so this is what this
one looks like this one's called smokin
hot pink and I'm just going to give you
a little swatches watch
so that's smokin hot pink I love this
color so much by the way these were like
a dollar fifty if I'm not mistaken might
have been a dollar actually I don't know
they're crazy cheap and that's gorgeous
this one's called cherry picking yeah my
husband we read the story he was like
that's the exact same lipstick I'm like
no don't you say that they're named
cherry picking and smokin hot pink
they're two different lipsticks II like
they look exactly the same but they
don't house girls we know we know this
one is was I just saying cherry picking
so I mean they look similar but they're
not this one's more like a rip they look
different on camera than they do on my
hand this one's definitely more of a I
look like a fool because they look
really really like the same on camera I
swear they're not and then the last one
which I think I'm the most excited about
because it's so awesome it's called
don't blink pink which I'm sure all of
you guys have seen these lipsticks
before because they're not new at all
but they're new to me so yeah this one
is called don't but I say don't I forget
I just said it I forgot it don't blink
pink oh these are amazing oh my god I
love those fuchsia neon II pinky colors
I love them these are so beautiful and
so cheap and they don't smell bad okay
guys I said that's everything I but uh
the other day um please let me know what
you think about these two mascara your
glory yeah my husband guys you look like
a crazy person yeah what's up me too
okay anyway so let me know what you
think about these two mascaras I'm
really picky when I
my mascaras and I hope that you guys
think that these are good well let me
know what you think about any of these
products because honestly I'm the only
thing that I've tried is the scandalize
mascara I haven't used I have never
tried any of these before even this I
haven't used this yet cuz I'm a damn
fool
and I'm obsessive what I don't know what
I'm talking about anyway thanks for
