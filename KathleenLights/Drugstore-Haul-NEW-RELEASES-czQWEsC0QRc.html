a drugstore haul let me let me tell you
guys something really quick
before anyone leaves me a comment about
it I know this is so crazy I said in my
last haul I was like you know what I'm
done I am done shopping for makeup I
have hauled way too much and then like
other day drugstore calm was 20% off of
everything so when I went on the website
I noticed that there was a ton of new
drugstore releases like I'm talking
about a lot so I was like oh I have to
place an order I like to blame my
channel for these things but no
seriously I buy so much makeup because
of my channel if I didn't have my
channel at all I wouldn't have 90% of
the things that I own so I'm constantly
buying drugstore products because I feel
like the drugstore just keeps getting
better and better and I want to be
involved with it like I love drugstore
makeup I love talking to you guys about
cheaper alternatives so that is why I
had to place another order and I had to
film another haul so I'm so sorry if you
hate hauls but I just there was so much
new drugstore makeup I have to share
okay so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started I put everything in like my
walgreens bag because I went to
Walgreens as well with this haul I
haven't tried anything out it is just
like an actual haul I'm just hauling
makeup I haven't tried anything because
I want to film a full face first
impressions leave me a comment down
below if that's something you would be
interested in seeing like a bunch of
these products um used in action for the
first time and I can give you like a
first impressions leave me a comment if
you would want to see that okay so there
was a ton of new releases from
Maybelline so I'm going to go through
all the stuff I got at Maybelline first
or from Maybelline I got three of their
brand new color tattoos now I know
you're thinking those things come in
pots but no no they came out with
something really really cool and I'm
very very excited to try this these are
their new color tattoo crayon
concentrates so I picked up this one in
the shade gold rush it's just a basic
gold shade this is a more light
champagne shade this one's called barely
beige and then this one is a 9
like gray charcoal color and it's called
charcoal chrome let me swatch this I
haven't even washed them oh they seem to
be swatching really nicely they're very
lightweight they're not too thick on my
hand but are they as good as the color
tattoos in the pot that we shall find
out because I love the color tattoos
they don't crease they last forever so I
hope these are just as good something in
extremely extremely similar packaging
like it almost looks the same this is
the new brow drama by eye studio it's a
pomade crayon which I don't typically
love eyebrow pomades but I'm really
excited to try this one out since it is
like in a crayon it's different I got
mine in this shade soft Brown oh cool it
doesn't look like it's my color but I
still have to test it out on the
eyebrows it has a nice formula it's not
too thick Maybelline has a brand new
foundation and I got the wrong color
because I bought it online
this is their new dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation I knew that I
wanted this because it says matte and
hydrating which is crazy to think that
something could be hydrating and ran at
the same time but even though I have
really dry skin sometimes I like a matte
foundation they just look really cakey
on me so I'm really excited to give this
a try even though this is a little bit
too dark for me I got sandy beige number
60 I don't know what made me think that
I would be this dark but I know for a
fact that this would be perfect when I'm
a little bit more self tanned even
though I could probably make this work
it's right here I could probably make it
work
yes I have a feeling I could make this
work it has kind of like a moosie
consistency but it feels so soft to the
touch I'm kind of very very intrigued it
feels really nice on my hand so again I
got it in sandy beige and I'm so excited
okay this is probably what I'm most
excited about wait until I show you oh I
got another one this is another color
tattoo crayon concentrate and I got
creamy chocolate it's like a really
pretty bronze shade totally forgot to
show you that
with the other ones okay that's what I
was saying I'm so so so so so excited
Maybelline came out with what appears to
be liquid lipsticks these are their new
vivid matte liquids and I have one two
three four I got five shades
I'm excessive like that there is one
more that I ordered but it's on back
order it was out of stock and it's
called possessed plum it's like a super
dark purple and that one should be
coming in the mail but I am so excited
to test out this formula I love the
packaging I think the packaging is so
incredibly cute and I'm really excited
to see how this formula like works so I
picked up the colors nude thrill it's a
basic nude shade I got this one in nude
flush this one is just pinkier the nude
flush is more pink this one's more Brown
and then I got this really pretty
vibrant red orange in the shade orange
orange shot orange shot this one in the
shade fuchsia ecstasy it's a really
pretty fuchsia and then this one it's a
really pretty berry shade and it's
called berry boost Maybelline also
released kind of like a contour palette
I have mine in the shade light to medium
they have two different ones they have
this one that's more for fair skin and
then one for deeper skin they have the
contour powder which um it looks like it
would be a really good color it's a
little bit warmer than I would like
contour with but I don't know I have to
try it on my face this blush looks
really pretty and then this highlight
looks really pretty so let's swatch them
because like I said I've never I haven't
watched this it comes with a little
brush that that I mean I guess you can
use to contour but it oh this highlight
shade looks really pretty I did not have
any expectations like at all for this
highlight shade it's right here you
can't see it like I said this contour
color is a little bit warmer than I
would contour with it has like some pink
to it let me see if I could show you you
see right there it has a little bit of
pink eNOS to this color I don't know
it's a little strange but like I said I
got a try
on my face and then the blush is just
like a regular pink blush it seems like
it has really good pigmentation I'm
really excited to try this out because I
was extremely unimpressed with the
Maybelline like nude palette thing that
they came out with recently I had like a
highlight in the middle i shadow zit hat
it was like a whole little kit and it
was awful the pigmentation it was just
terrible
I think I returned mine it was horrible
but these swatched really nicely how
cool are these they came out with three
different master Prime um long lasting
eyeshadow basis so they came out with
eyeshadow primer
they camel with three different ones and
I picked up two of them they have one
that mattifies your eye so you put it on
and it's supposed to like help with
increasing like if you have really oily
eyelids I don't I have dry eyelid so I
didn't pick that one up but I got these
two this one is prime and smooth it like
smooths out your lids makes them nice
and smooth I don't know why yeah and
this one is prime and illuminate it
gives you like a nice shimmery base so
let me test this out on my hand I'm
curious to see how this smooths your
eyelids let me see it looks like it's a
little bit shimmery and this isn't the
illuminate one but it does have like a
soft glow to it but it kind of has like
a silicone slippery feeling what you'll
see and then this one is the illuminate
one and it looks like it has like a
champagne topi kind of color to it oh
yeah this one is actually shimmery wow
this is actually really really beautiful
look at that like glow it has a really
pretty sheen so this one mmm it looks
like I might really like this one I hope
it actually Prime's my eyelids though
like I hope it keeps my eyeshadow in
place all day and that it makes them
like more vibrant I'm very excited to
see if that works and they came out with
a setting spray this is the Maybelline
master fix buy face studio we're
boosting setting spray locks and makeup
and it has a long-lasting finish
translucent oil-free it says
oh so I'm gonna let that dry a little
bit I really like this spray like the
nozzle it doesn't squirt like product
into my face I really like how it
sprayed out this reminds me a lot of the
L'Oreal infallible one the setting spray
I've never tried that one but I decided
to pick this one up because I've always
wanted to try that one but never did but
this one is new so but anyway that is
everything I got from Maybelline they
came out with a ton of new stuff now
onto some more random e things I was so
excited when I saw this on drugstore
comm you guys have no idea okay this is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
foundation buildable luminous foundation
and I got mine in the shade W - I think
I got my correct shade this is just like
the amore Pacific one the Lancome has
like a BB cushion type thing like this
and what is the other brand Lynette like
the Nana's BB cushion basically you just
open it it has a mirror it has your
little Foundation applicator right here
and then you open this up and your
foundation is right there up and then
you just stamp the product in and then
put it on your face these types of
foundations I think are very popular um
in Asia I'm not exactly sure I could
main that up I'm really excited to try
this out because I really liked the
Lynette one I got a sample of it like in
an Ipsy bag awhile ago and I really
really liked it to be my skin so DUII
it was a little bit tacky though so I'm
really excited to see how this works I
could probably do the first impression
on this if you would really like me to
I'm excited
Burt's Bees came out with a bunch of new
lipsticks like they've always had like
chap sticks and lip balms but I've never
really seen like a hardcore lip stick
until the other day when I was at
Walgreens so I got mine in the shade 501
blush Basin blush Bassin I'm not sure
and this is what it looks like I really
really love the packaging on this is
that weird it looks like a honeycomb I
really like the packaging and I really
love this color it is a sheer formula
this is it right here it's a sheer
formula but you can tell it's very very
very hydrating and moisturizing which is
something that I typically like I would
have expected from Burt's Bees so I'm
really excited to just like toss this in
my purse and apply throughout the day
it's such a pretty color I saw this on a
new display and this is their wet and
wild liquid eyeliner this isn't a new
product but it says new formula right
here on the box so I'm assuming that
they like took it out and then like
revamp the formula and then brought it
out and I got mine in shade dark brown
and it says it dries fast I have so many
black liquid liners and I wanted to try
out their new formula so I just got dark
brown another face product I went like
crazy with the face stuff this is the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin anti-aging
Perfector I saw this like on a new
display so I wanted to try it out I
don't typically love Neutrogena but I'm
really really excited to try this I got
mine in the shade light to neutral
number 30 and this is their BB cream
pretty much it says moisturizing retinol
treatment with sunscreen broad-spectrum
SPF 20 and even skin tone I'm gonna
assume it's just like a BB cream but it
has retinol treatment in it which is
really really cool which is the main
reason why I bought it because of the
retinol treatment I want to see how that
works I have two mascara type of
products one is actually a primer for
your mascara this is the Milani length
in seconds lash extensions fiber this
reminds me a lot of the Too Faced
they have like a mascara then that is
like a similar concept where it has like
the fibers on the wand and you apply
this huh fibers just flew everywhere I
don't know if you guys saw that it has
the fibers on the wand and they're
supposed to stick to your lashes and
then you apply your regular mascara on
top and it's supposed to make your
lashes thicker more voluminous even
longer so I'm excited
see how this one works out I love Milani
so much it's one of my favorite brands
and then the mascara I decided to pick
up is brand new from Revlon and it is
there um volume and length magnified
mascara I got mine in blackest black
they had like four different types they
had one specifically for volumizing one
specifically for lengthening and then
this one that did both volume and length
and I thought well I want a little bit
of both so I picked up the blue one
they're all like different colors I
really love the packaging something
about this blue little cap is calling my
name and I'm very excited to try this
out because it is a fiber bristle want
it's not rubber and I prefer like more
natural bristles on my mascara so I got
two eyeshadows from L'Oreal they came
out with a ton of new eyeshadows what
are they specifically called the color
riche eyeshadows and i have mine in the
shade quartz fume and then i bought
another one that's orange but it was on
backorder as well so it shipped already
but it hasn't gotten here yet but i'm so
impressed by the quality of this
eyeshadow specifically so i'm very
excited to get the orange one in the
mail they're very very creamy like when
you put your finger in them they're so
creamy so pigmented i love them
and then i got this product from
covergirl another face products but it's
not like a foundation or anything this
is their covergirl trublend face primer
they have three different ones I believe
have one I think for combo skin one for
oily skin and one for dry skin so I
picked up the one for dry skin since I
have dry skin I'm so I have such like
high expectations for this because I
love primers and I feel like the
drugstore really lacks in that
department and this one's targeted for
my skin type so I hope it's so good
please don't let me down and then the
last product I got well products but
they're all the same thing I saw these
on display as well so of course I had to
get more than one these are the
infallible Pro matte gloss so L'Oreal
already has their infallible lip glosses
that have been like in the Ranger ready
but I saw this on a new display and it
said matte so they're kind of like in
the same packaging only these are matte
so
these are like their versions of liquid
lipsticks I'm gonna assume so I'm really
really trying these out as well I picked
up six colors this one I'm so excited
about it's a really bright like Barbie
pink this one is called fuchsia amnesia
this one is a really pretty lick rosy
mauve and this one's called nude allude
then this one is a really pretty nude I
think it's their lightest one and this
one's called bear attraction this one's
are really pretty like everyday pink and
this one is called blushing ambition and
then this is a red like a basic nice hot
red it's called Shanghai scarlet yes and
then this really pretty berry shade in
forbidden kiss okay guys so that
completes this haul video I hope you
