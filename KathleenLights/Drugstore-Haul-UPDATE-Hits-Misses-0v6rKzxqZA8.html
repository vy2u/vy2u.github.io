my drugstore haul update I recently did
a drugstore haul and I told you guys
once I try out the products a little bit
more if you wanted me to sit down and
update you guys because I sometimes feel
that hauls are kind of like not helpful
because you're just like showing
products that you bought and although
it's fun I love watching hauls I love
filming them whenever I film AHA I want
to sit down and update you guys like two
weeks later just to tell you how I'm
liking the products or not liking them
so I have all the products I bought in
that drugstore haul in this bag and I'm
just I'm using them since I filmed it
it's a little bit less than two weeks
and I'm cheating right now but I'm pre
recording cuz I'm going out of town but
though I've used all these products
enough to tell you guys my actual
thoughts but basically I'm just gonna go
ahead and get started on my little mini
reviews ok so ever since um well I
bought in a ton of questions about the
organic wear BB cream by Physicians
Formula this is what it looks like I
actually love this I think it's
beautiful I had bought the light to
medium shade but it was too dark for me
so I went back and picked up the light
shake the color selection isn't my
favorite but I have to say I really like
this product I love how it makes my skin
look it doesn't look overly dewy but
it's not matte either it's kind of just
like a very natural finish it has SPF 20
which is awesome and my favorite part is
that it's a physical SPF not a chemical
one which they're both really good but
physical SPF is a little bit less harsh
on my sensitive skin I never break out
with physical SPF for a BB cream it has
pretty good coverage I would say it has
light to medium coverage you could
definitely build it up though I also
hauled this guy this is the Pacifica
ultra CC cream radiant foundation SPF 17
I actually do like this as well I think
I like the Physicians Formula one a
little bit better it has a little bit
more coverage and I just like how it
sits on my skin better but this one is
really nice this is the shade natural /
medium to dark for me so I did have to
mix it in with a white foundation it has
coconut water and it also is a physical
sunscreen which I love right now I'm
wearing a powder foundation on top of it
actually I will show you in a second I
wouldn't say that I love this but I
definitely do like it I think it's one
of the better CC creams I've tried from
the drugstore for sure I know I didn't
haul this but I wanted to show you guys
because I bought this the day
after I hold it this is the flower
powder trip powder foundation from
flower beauty I got this at Walmart this
is the powder foundation I'm wearing
over my CC cream and I really like this
I wanted to mention it just in case some
of you were looking for a good drugstore
powder foundation it doesn't have like
full full coverage I would say it has
like light to medium coverage but you
could definitely build it up and I just
like how this looks on the skin it
doesn't look too cakey or too powdery I
definitely have powders that I prefer
for my dry skin but for being affordable
at the drugstore this is a great powder
foundation and I don't know why I'm
telling you that because I didn't haul
it but I just wanted to show you okay
let's talk about the blushes I hold I
recently bought these three blushes this
one is from Sonia Kashuk and this is in
the shade pink rose I freaking love the
formula of this blush it just blends so
nicely it's not too too pigmented which
I actually prefer you guys know I like
more of a subtle blush I don't feel like
I have to tap off my brush 100 times and
then like apply it lightly some blushes
they're too pigmented aren't my favorite
this has like the perfect amount of
pigment they're called the beautifying
blushes so I got these two from
Physicians Formula this one I picked up
at Target but this one I got on Amazon
because I couldn't find it anywhere and
I was on the hunt for this they're both
in the shade natural but this is the
Physicians Formula happy booster blush
and this is just their mineral where
talc free blush this blush has SPF 30
isn't that funny I think that's pretty
cool
and there's not much to say about this
it's just a nice standard blush it's the
blush I'm wearing on my cheeks it is
matte which I kind of prefer a blush
with a little bit of a sheen this one I
love love love it gives your face a
beautiful glow I love the little hearts
it gives you a very natural pink touch
to the face this one the other one is a
little bit more neutral this one is a
little bit pinkier it's very glowy very
beautiful I highly recommend this little
happy booster blush I think it's so like
youthful and perfect for spring and
summer
okay so I'm going to go ahead and talk
about all these lip products I hold so
in my haul I actually said that I really
liked these products but now that I've
tried them and use them I have to say
they're not my favorite these are the
flower lip tints they're like chubby
crayon sticks
Revlon has very sim
one's called the just kissable balm
stain tarte has them like there's a ton
of our brand to have lip products that
look like this I don't know if it's just
these two specific colors but there is a
lot of glitter in these products and
when I hold it I didn't mind it because
it looks really pretty on the lips and
then I put a gloss on top and it just
looked nice when I initially hold it I
don't know if it's just me but once the
color fades like the glitter stays there
and I kind of have like weird glittery
lips even when I try to take it off like
at the end of the day like there's still
like glitter on my lips it's so strange
maybe I just picked up two colors that
unfortunately had glitter ammendment I
didn't notice but I would definitely say
pass on the sheer lip tints because I
find that other brands make this product
a little bit better
I hold the hard candy plumping serum
volumizing lip gloss I thought this was
gonna be like really tingly and
literally like plumping but it's not it
honestly just is like a sheer lip gloss
that makes your lips look juicy it like
gives your lips the effect of nice plump
juicy lips but there's no tingling
sensation there's no like burning it
doesn't make my lips look bigger
honestly it's just a clear gloss but I
really like the formula this is in the
shade Swan Lake and there really is
nothing bad I have to say about this
it's just a standard lip gloss but a
nice one I really like it
I also hauled these lip glosses these
are the shine on lip glosses by flower
and they're okay I was wearing this one
in the video when I hold it this is
baby's breath these are nice but they're
definitely not my favorite they're a
little bit less glossy than I would like
them to be it's more of just like a wash
of kind of like a watery color when I
filmed that video there was a ton of you
guys who told me to pick up these
glosses instead they're from the same
brand flower Beauty these are the flower
Beauty lip radiance high shine lip
lacquers these are the high shine lip
glosses and their different formulas
completely different formulas I think
they're around the same price but I even
prefer like the packaging on these look
how pretty these glosses look I'm
actually wearing this one right now I'm
wearing it on top of lumière lip liner
by color pop this is in the shade pink
about me I love these I love them I love
them so much I think they give you like
a really nice glossy look to the lips
the other lip glosses I
then they kind of have like a milky
consistency these are a little bit
thicker but they're not super sticky
like I don't find them uncomfortable to
wear at all okay so let's talk about the
concealers I hauled this is the Sonia
Kashuk
all cover-up concealer I got mine in the
shade ivory I really like this this is a
great concealer for blemishes yesterday
Selene scratched me like no one purpose
but she was to jump on me and scratched
my chin so I have like a big scratch on
my chin and this did a great job of
covering it up the Pacifica CC cream
didn't cover it up when I applied it I
mean it made it less red but it didn't
cover it up it's thick but it's not hard
to blend out when I first put my finger
in it I was like oh this is know me a
little too thick but it's not it's thick
enough to where it will give you really
good coverage but it's very easy to
blend out with your finger on any
blemishes I also got the highlighting
concealer pen thing from flower Beauty I
don't know the exact name because it's
not on the actual packaging I like this
this is good it has decent coverage for
being a concealing pen but it's not my
favorite I definitely prefer my wet and
wild one it's more affordable and I like
the way it looks on my skin better I
picked up two brow products in that haul
that did not work for me simply because
of the color it's the Sonia Kashuk one
and then the essence one you guys
probably saw this coming because I said
it in that video this is like a grey
this is literally grey I didn't notice
when I purchased it online or Mila wise
I couldn't even give it a fair shot
because I looked ridiculous so I just
couldn't even wear it same goes with the
essence
make me proud but I will say that even
though the color doesn't fit me I loved
the way it applied like this essence
make me brow is the same as the benefit
gimme brow only much cheaper I got mine
off Amazon
I wonder if essence makes different
colors because I would like to try out
like a warmer shade I got this mascara
that if you saw that video I discovered
something while filming it this is the
flower zooming ultimate mascara when I
first got this I did not like this
because I thought that it was just like
a weird wand it's like really large and
the bristles are like very spread out
like there's gaps in between them and it
just didn't do much for my lashes I mean
it lengthen them but there was really no
volume to it
but I realized that this mascara twists
at the top watch I'll show ya watch the
wand it gets smaller so it twists and
then it makes the bristles get really
really close together is shortened to
one and then that is really good for
volumizing I have to be honest I've
never truly loved flower mascaras but
this one is awesome okay almost done
just two more products here this is the
hard candy pro illuminate and strobing
at mix and drops this in the shade white
pearl I'm surprised by this I really
really like this I definitely think that
you cannot use too much because it could
look a little bit weird and disco Bali
and a little bit shimmery on your face
but just one little drop of this in your
foundation and I think it gives you a
very subtle natural glow to the skin
I wore it mixed in with my shadow
synchro skin foundation and I really
like the combination that's just a toe
foundation gives you like a nice and
natural finish but adding a little bit
of this makes it a little bit more
illuminating which I like I have to say
that I do prefer other illuminating
products to mix in with my foundation
like the Becca shimmering skin
perfectors like the liquid ones those I
love mixing in with foundations and I
would most likely reach for those over
this one but if you're looking for a
drugstore alternative something to mix
in with foundation that's affordable
this is a pretty good one and then the
last thing I have to talk about is the
NYX honey do me up this is a primer
pretty much if your NYX lover and you
have dry skin and you haven't tried this
what are you waiting for this is like a
drink of water for your skin like I
apply it to my whole face before a
foundation and it kind of just goes over
my dry patches and hydrates them but it
doesn't leave your face greasy or weird
like it's a really nice primer for dry
skin so that completes this video that
was my update from my drugstore haul
only a couple things I didn't love but
most of them I truly am liking let me
know if you've tried any of these
products and if you feel the same way I
do or if you feel differently let me
know thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
my foundations and ah well I just had a
coffee Jack I want to sit down and up
you up you guys
