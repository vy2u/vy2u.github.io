today actually I feel like such a hot
mess lately I probably look like hot
mess
right now too I haven't painted my nails
in like a week
my house is kind of a mess like I really
have to clean after I even film this
video you know when you just feel like
not not yourself like not girly and just
feel like icky and then everything like
falls apart around you and you just
don't know what's wrong with you that's
what's been happening to me and of
course there's absolutely no Sun today
I'm gonna try my best to get really good
lighting well in the near future I'm
gonna try my best to get some good
lighting because I can't deal with the
Sun in and out thing it drives me crazy
but anyway umm I really wanted to film
this video today because I have so much
to do tomorrow so I don't know if I'm
gonna be able to it because I was
feeling so like buttah recently I was
like you know what Kathleen go to Target
buy yourself a couple of things and a
couple turns into twenty things so I'm
just gonna go ahead and show you the
stuff I bought all of these things are
really random I honestly just went to
Target looking for one specific thing
that I have wanting to get my hands on
forever which I'll show you in a minute
and then of course things happen and you
just to buy a bunch of stuff I don't
know okay so I've mentioned before how
much I really love the Wet n Wild mega
last lipsticks I think they're amazing
and I picked up three other ones I got
this one called sugarplum fairy which is
not a summer color at all it's very much
for the fall but I heard that it's a
really really good dupe for max rebel
lipstick which I don't own I've tried on
rebel at the MAC store about two or
three times and each time I don't get it
because I never felt like it looked good
on me so I picked up this one because
I've heard that it's honestly a really
really close dupe so I thought that I
might like this for the Fall the other
one I picked up is 24 karat gold I have
been wanting this one for so so long but
every time
I would go it was sold out oh by the way
I bought these what a lot of lipsticks
not at Target I bought them on base
because they don't sell when a while
that my target can you believe that that
that upsets me
but anyway 24 karat gold is just this
really really beautiful orange color and
Emma wanting this for so long because
even though I really really love my more
Angela stick by Mac I feel like I would
love it a lot more if it was Adin matte
and then the third one I picked up is
the one that I actually have on my lips
and I'm pretty sure this is new I I
think it's you because I've never seen
it before it's called purty wave pretty
persimmon I'm probably butchering that
but it's the most beautiful like red
red-orange it's very similar to max so
shot but only this one is a little bit
more orange and that one is which is
what I love and what's great about these
wait a while may collapse megalast
lipsticks I've said it a million times
but they have no scent whatsoever
I am big on how my lipsticks smell if
they smell bad I will not wear them but
I prefer lipstick to have absolutely no
scent than to smell bad I love that they
don't smell like anything love these
okay so while I was at Target I saw this
beautiful display of brand new nail
polishes I'm pretty sure they were brand
new because I've never seen them before
and it was a new collection for the
Sally Hansen extreme wear nail polishes
and I think it's like a fruit collection
because all of the nail polishes had a
fruit in the name of the nail polish
anyway these are the only two that I
picked up from the beautiful display I
picked up this one it's called peach
Beach and this one is called perfect
pairing get it pear pear ring I thought
that was funny but yeah it's just like a
pastel II kind of pink I don't know it
reminds me a lot of ESI's Vanda go only
a little bit more pinky and I just love
how this green looks in the bottle it's
beautiful I can't wait to use these
and then I picked up two more nail
polishes from the exact same brand only
these aren't from a collection these
have been out for a while
I got Laci lilac which is a beautiful
lilac color obviously and then I got
mello Yello my sister sent me a picture
of her nails with this mellow yellow
color on it and I fell in love with it I
was like I need to go get it swatches
beautifully it's a nice opaque yellow so
I picked up those nail polishes it
seemed this seems like a very spring
whatever I love them also in the nail
polish category I picked up a backup of
my absolutely favorite base coat and top
coat these are the Revlon Colorstay base
coat and top coat nothing makes my nail
polish last as long as these things and
the top coat is so shiny I continue to
repurchase this I've know how many
bottles I bought of these things
fantastic okay so earlier I said that I
had gone to Target for this one specific
item and it was the Sonia Kashuk um
cream bronzer and I've heard so many
people talk about this and a lot of
people love it so I was like I'm going
to give that to go I picked up the one
that was a little bit lighter it's
called warm tan and oh okay
it has like a oh it has a mirror fancy
and it seems like it's a good color for
me I haven't faked tan in a while I
gotta get on that but it doesn't seem to
orange it to me especially when I have a
fake tan warm bronzers do look really
nice on me so I'm really really excited
to try this like I have been wanting
this for a while now I am a little bit
skeptical because I've never tried a
cream bronzer at all but oh I hope this
is a good one and I just love the
packaging on this
it looks really expensive but what to me
it just looks looks fancy I also picked
up the voluminous carbon black mascara
because I can't tell you how many times
I've picked this up and then put it back
because it has a bunch of mixed reviews
it looks like the kind of scare that I
would really love because it it's not a
plastic one first of all I don't like
plastic one I'm like more of the fiber
bristles I think that's how you say it
and I love really really volumizing
mascaras and I've heard that that's
exactly what this is but I've heard that
it smears on people which and I don't
really have bad luck when it comes to
smearing with mascaras but I don't know
I'm really hoping that I'll love this
okay so I was walking down the
maybelline section and I was like um
they came out with those new color
tattoo pigments and when I went up to
them none of them really called my
attention that much except one which is
the only one I picked up and it is never
fade Jade it's like a beautiful
blue-green color and I think that this
would be a really fun look so that's why
I picked it up the rest were like Browns
and there was a purple and stuff like
that but this honestly was the one that
I found the prettiest I'm going to be
trying this out soon and hopefully I
love it okay so while that was at the
exchange on base which is kind of like a
Walmart type store by the way they have
a section of like high-end makeup and
shampoos and hair products and stuff
like that so I just ran out of my
shampoo and conditioner and I really
needed to pick up some more and I went
with my mindset on the Frederic Fekkai
brilliant glossing shampoo and
conditioner but when I went it was
completely sold out they didn't have any
more and I was so bummed but I really
needed to pick up a shampoo and
conditioner so I picked up these right
here I picked up the healthy sexy hair
soy moisture shampoo
and soymilk conditioner now this has
mixed reviews online a lot of people say
that they don't like it but a lot of
people say that they love it
like two people you either hate this or
love this but it is sulfate free gluten
free paraben free which is really really
good I love sulfate free shampoos and it
has argan oil in it and they say it's
really good for dry hair which you know
that's my hair type so I really hope I
enjoy this shampoo and conditioner it
seems like it would fit my hair type so
let's hope okay so I'm just gonna go
ahead and show you the rest of the lip
products I bought should've showed you
them when I was showing you in the wet
wild lipsticks but anyway I am a huge
lip junkie lip products are my favorite
thing to wear it it's like my favorite
makeup product of all time so every time
I go shopping for makeup I come home
with like a bunch of lip products it's
kind of sad but that being said I bought
this beautiful lipstick from Revlon it's
the matte Super Lustrous lipstick and
stormy pink and it just looks like this
and surprisingly I have nothing in my
lipstick collection that looks anything
like this because I feel like it's a
happy medium it's not super super bold
and bright in your face like a loud pink
lipstick but it's not toned down and
muted it's like right in between the
perfect pink lipstick in my opinion and
I think that this is a perfect lipstick
for everyone I think anyone can rock
this color it's so beautiful okay so the
other day I made a shocking discovery
and I'm so happy that I did I picked up
these two Milani lipstick these are the
color statement lipsticks and okay
listen to me guys listen to me for a
second I love these lipsticks more than
my MAC lipsticks I know I know but wait
wait wait these lipsticks smell exactly
exactly like watermelon Jolly Ranchers
and if you own a MAC lipstick you know
how good they smell and that's a big
reason why I love them because I
like the cheap drugstore smell of a
lipstick and oh my god first of all the
packaging on these bad boys are so
beautiful they look so fancy like look
how beautiful this is
they smell like Jolly Ranchers they
smell so good
the formula is amazing I love this the
only thing I don't like about the color
statement lipsticks is that most of them
are like very frosty and like shimmery
and I don't like that but I picked up
these two and I loved them so much that
I picked up another one yesterday and
this one isn't frosty either so I have
nude cream which is a beautiful nude
color and what I love this is that it's
when you put on your lips it's not too
pink and it's not too new and I think
that a lot of skin tones would really
really like this because I think this
would look really nice on dark skin tone
- and on tan skin and I just it's a
beautiful new each other and then I got
this one which is probably my favorite
one and it's like my favorite lipstick
right now it's so it's so beautiful it's
called the rose hip and it's like so
buh-bam in your face beautiful this
makes like my whole face pop like I'll
just have some mascara on and then I'll
put this bad boy on and like my whole
face just comes together I know it
sounds really weird but this is a
beautiful lipstick I recommend this one
out of all three of them rosehip amazing
and then I got this one which is called
sweet nectar and it's for the orange
lipstick lovers out there it's like a
very neon orange extremely similar to
Mac's morons but smells better than not
it's just a beautiful purple orange
amazing if you like orange lipsticks
definitely recommend the Milani color
statement lipsticks you will not be
disappointed and then right before I was
about to leave Target I kind of just
like was walking through the AL my
section and honestly I don't have any
Alamein makeup only some things yeah
yeah I don't have any makeup from
element it just has never called to me
but I saw that they came out with these
what are these called foot of these
called liquid lip balms and I've heard a
couple of people really really like this
so I picked up this one and it is called
nude treant that's witty nutrients get
it nude trance-like nutrients but I
really really loved it this color it
looks like the perfect baby glossy color
to pair on top of a pink or a nude and I
just I think it's really pretty I
haven't tried it on my lips yet
obviously but okay and the last thing I
picked up is something from one wild one
wild it's like my all-time favorite
drugstore brand amazing stuff I picked
up the color icon bronzer in reservior
cabana and clearly this is not a bronzer
but I think that because I had seen
swatches of it online and it looked like
such a beautiful natural highlight and I
thought I could put this underneath my
eyes use it as a highlight on my
cheekbones
on the bridge of my nose and I honestly
would probably only use this when I was
self-tanning I haven't soak em in a
while like I said earlier but I would
only use this when I'm self-tanning like
when I have a little bit of a glow to me
because I think this would look really
beautiful on top and by the way this
smells really good it's probably the
sunscreen it has SPF 15 in it but smells
like the beach like no lie this smells
really really good okay I said I wasn't
that was everything I got let me know
down below if you have any of these
products and if you like them and if you
would like to hear my thoughts on any of
these products just let me know thank
