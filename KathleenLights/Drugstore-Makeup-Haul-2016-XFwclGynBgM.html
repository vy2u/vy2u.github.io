a drugstore haul absolutely did one like
a month ago and it's still sitting in
the bag I have been testing out the
products though to give you guys like an
updated review so I have been using them
have just been putting him back in the
bag for that review coming up I wasn't
going to film this video because I just
recently did a drugstore haul and
everyone everyone has been doing hauls
because the drugstore has just come out
with like a million new things I want my
coffee in it but I thought I would post
it anyway just to get your feedback this
is what I'm planning on doing okay so
this is what I want to do let me know if
you want if you worry so I'm gonna haul
these products now obviously I'm going
to show you everything I bought and I'm
gonna link my other drugstore haul down
below which is things I got in the other
bag and two weeks from now or more or
less a drugstore review with all the new
stuff I got so like a new product from
the drugstore review and I'm gonna talk
about everything in depth
I'm gonna test all these products out
for like the next two weeks and give you
guys like a full review in depth of all
the new stuff that has come out I think
that's just better that way because yeah
I can stay here and all these things and
what if I hate something and I just
never end up using it again or so I want
you guys to get like a review on new
drugstore products not just a haul
you gave me I mean today is the haul but
I am gonna show you what I'm gonna be
reviewing in two weeks so it's it's been
official revlon came out with new
brushes there's like a whole display by
the way i got everything at walgreens
that's where i got my own I went to Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond as well so some of these I
got a Bed Bath and Beyond and some are
Walgreens I got it don't worry
so Revlon came out with like a bunch of
new brushes I haven't even opened them
because I wanted to show you guys what
they look like in the packaging this is
what sucks about them you cannot feel
the brushes before you buy them but at
my Walgreens they did have one like on
display they had this one on display and
it just felt so soft that I wanted to
buy it so let me open them these weren't
exactly like super inexpensive the
drugstore limiting the truck store has
got miss prissom my computer turned off
leave me a comment down below and let me
know how I can keep my computer on
stupid I know I am oh my god I don't
know how to keep my screen on like my
little screen like I have no idea how to
keep it on and you would think something
so easy I would know how to do but I
don't
and sometimes I'm in this room at
nighttime like watching Netflix on my
laptop but it's so dark that I want to
keep like the compass computer on now
we're just let me know how do I keep
that on anyway so this is the powder
brush and it's a little bit like
scratchy like when you touch it to your
face like right here it doesn't feel
like it cosmetics or anything like that
but when I do this it just feels so soft
I really like the shape of these this is
the Revlon powder brush and then I got
these two here this one is the blending
brush it's a stippling brush for a
business to open oh my gosh this one is
really ah this one is incredibly soft
it's just a typical dual fiber but holy
crap that is swapped that's very soft
and then this one is their blush brush
it reminds me a lot of just like a
buffing brush oh it's not so soft it's a
little stiff like when I touch you to my
face but it just feels so soft I don't
know this would probably be really nice
for powder foundation as well okay so I
nearly flip smush
when I saw all the new wet and wild
stuff so I'm going to go into that
they've already had their color icon
blushes for a really really long time
but everyone used to say like in videos
I remember like when I first started
watching YouTube a lot of people were
really into those blushes but everyone
would say like oh they're so pigmented
like it's at a pure brush and that
always freaked me out so I never bought
them because I'm not someone who loves
to pack on the blush but I saw that they
reformulated them and they came out with
the same colors and then one new one
that I bought it I just wanted anyway
just cuz I like the new packaging I mean
it's not like the best packaging ever
but I do like it more than their old
packaging and it says new formula so
that intrigued me by the way the
lighting I still haven't figured it out
yet it's raining really badly today and
I just I haven't figured it out I need
more lighting it's bear with me please I
just moved in here so the two that we're
already in their collection was mellow
wine and pearlescent pink they seem very
similar pearlescent pink it's just a
little bit lighter and they are very
very very pigmented just like everybody
said back in the day and then I got this
one in this one I absolutely love this
is the blush I'm wearing right now it's
called rose champagne and when I first
swatched this blush I was like oh this
is way too light it's just not going to
show up on my skin at all
and this is the blush I'm wearing right
now and I think I really did a good job
of showing up on my skin I already had
this product okay so this is the wet and
wild mega glow contouring palette they
came out with two shades like in the
summer I want to say and I bought both
of them
I had bought them both and they were
good I really liked them at first but I
realized I would just wasn't reaching
for them like I was reaching for my
other contouring products so before I
moved out of my old house I like cleaned
out my makeup I like donated a bunch
sent some to Cuba like I got rid of a
lot of makeup and this was something
that I ended up giving away I think I
gave it to one of my friends I was in
the wet and wild section and I saw that
it said it had a new formula so this is
like the same product but with a
different formula and I have to say it
is better this is what I contoured with
today and I applied this underneath my
eyes this isn't what I set my concealer
with but I did put it underneath my
is just too bright it up a little bit
and it made a difference it made a big
difference I really really like this
this is so much better than their old
formula and this is in the shade dulce
de leche they came out with a setting
spray and I freaking love what a wild
guys it's probably one of my favorite
drugstore brands because it's so
inexpensive and their quality is on par
with all the other brands at Walgreens
and they're a lot cheaper so I just
always gravitate towards one wild
they're amazing so this is their folk
focal focus no photo focus vapor rep fit
that's like not English excuse me this
side is English this is the photo focus
setting spray and I used it today
I love the spray like the nozzle I love
how it sprays it doesn't soak just one
part of my face I really really really
like that
is it good does it set my makeup I don't
know I will update you in two weeks what
in wild also came out with a bunch of
new brushes and my Walgreens was wiped
out they only had this this tiny little
brush and this is their small concealer
brush the only reason why I wanted to
buy it is so that I can show you guys
what they look like they're so pretty I
want them so bad so I want to see if
they have them in a different Walgreens
their white brushes with pink you can't
see it with like a little pink bristles
up at the top I think this would be
really good too to apply color pop
eyeshadows which is why I bought it but
I want the rest of them okay so this is
another wet and wild product that they
like reformulated and it came out with
like they already had it but this is
their mega Glo illuminating palette and
they used to have this in like a much
much much smaller packaging but I never
had tried that one I tried this out
today I do like that they made it bigger
because it's a lot easier to get into
every individual strip like today I only
used these two right here these first
two and it's the highlight I'm wearing
on my face right now and I do like it
it's a little bit glittery I like more
of a sheen this one gives you just a
little bit of glitter but it's really
inexpensive and I like it I do have to
play around with it more to see but it's
not
that it's not my favorite highlighter
though for sure now I'm not exactly sure
if this next product is new but it did
have a sticker that said new and I
didn't own it so I'm gonna assume us no
this is from their Fergie line and this
is an eyeshadow palette it's called
Ferris runway it's full of a ton of
purples and like dark charcoal colors I
have one of these in like the brown
family that is really good
and let me tell you these little brushes
that come in the center stage I shadow
palettes are really really good it's
like a crease brush and an all-over
shader brush it's not like a crappy like
sponge I'm so excited for this this is
the one wild instant flawless complexion
highlighting and concealing pen this is
really similar to the Maybelline Dream
Lumi I think that's what it's called I
love that one and so I'm really excited
to see if this is similar I got mine in
the shade ivory ivory in to you I've
read to you it's actually funny can't
tell there it's just a little bit
lighter than my skin tone it feels
really nice and hydrating on my skin so
I'm excited to see how this works I got
two of the new graphic marker eyeliners
and to be honest I don't know why I did
because I don't think I'm gonna like
these I got airliner blue and jetliner
black Maybelline came out with something
really similar to this like their
graphic liner and I don't think I really
like that much so I don't know why I got
this but it was new and I wanted to try
it out for you guys
then another eyeliner I got from one in
wild I think is also new it says it's
new it's the felt tip eyeliner and it
just says find lines I got black that's
the shade black and I'm always in the
market to try out new felt-tip regular
eyeliners like this especially if it's
wet and wild
that means it's super inexpensive wow
that's very very very black but will it
be good on the eyes
this is their last show Matic mascara
duo
it has a mascara and then a fiber thing
so if you saw my like up other drugstore
haul that I posted not that long ago
Milani also came out with like a fiber
mascara which I will update you guys if
I like it or not in a video I decided to
try this one out to see if maybe it was
different I liked the fact that I had
they had like a duo here and this is the
mascara right here it says prime and
seal and then this is the lash fibers so
what you do is you go ahead and you coat
your mess your eyelashes with this
mascara nothing like that
once you coat your mascara once you coat
your lashes can I speak today
once you coat your lashes you go in with
the fibers you do it on top of it and
then you do this process one more time
and it's supposed to give you like a ton
of volume and be like excellent another
thing from one wild I feel like they
have been killing it at the drugstore
recently I was really excited to see
this because I have been into drugstore
brow products like crazy recently and
this is their ultimate brow mascara I
got mine in nothing but brunette let's
see the wand I'm excited I'm exciting
oh it's little okay good it's the
perfect size I was scared it was gonna
look something crazy like the Maybelline
brow mascara horrible it has like this
weird ball up it's bad okay and then I
have one more thing to share with you
from actually not one thing only it's a
group of things they came out with these
really awesome one-step wonder gel nail
polishes and these are supposed to be
like gel manicures at home without
having to use a light it's essentially a
regular nail polish but it's supposed to
last longer and it's supposed to have a
gel like finish I got this one in stay
classy it's a really pretty mom this one
is pale in comparison it's like a white
with a little over pink and this one is
pinkie swear which is like a pink with a
little bit away this one is scientific
method and then this one is condensed
milk this one is the one I'm wearing on
my nails right now when I bought this I
was like oh my god what a beautiful like
taupe color but no that is not the color
you get on the inside I didn't open it
at the store
I just got it and I bought it and I was
a little bit disappointed in the color
because I thought it was going to be
darker but I freaking love it I ended up
really liking the color it's the nail
polish I'm wearing right now so I
applied this nail polish on Monday
and today is Friday and they're still
going strong I'm someone who might nail
polish chips the very next day like okay
that's a little bit dramatic but like
two or three days that's as long as my
nail polish lasts unless I go like all
out with like a fabulous base coat
freakin amazing top coat like my nail
polish just doesn't last so I'm very
surprised to see that this it's Friday
and it's still on my nails I only have a
little bit of chipping right here
because I've been opening boxes and
doing a bunch of things since I've been
moving but I'm very very very impressed
and I'm gonna assume the rest of them
have this formula so I'm so glad I went
all out and bought a bunch they're
fabulous and they're so inexpensive it's
what a while I mean I'm very very happy
with this I got a couple new L'Oreal
products this is their new infallible
mapped Matic gel cream intense matte
color what is this actually cold
mechanical eyeliner and I got mine in
ultra black so why I bought this because
you guys know my NYX Twiggy Lee
eyeliners are the best freaking
eyeliners and I don't need to shop
around because I love those so much but
because of my channel I like to expand
my horizons and what really intrigued me
was that it's matte Matic and supposedly
it's like super long wearing and stuff
so it is a twist up which so is my next
one so you ain't special and then the
last two products I got from L'Oreal our
brow products I actually don't think
this is new it says new but I don't know
maybe I've seen it before it's their
brow stylist prep and shape pro kit brow
stylist plumper I really really loved so
I wanted to see something else from the
brow stylist range and it's just like a
little box nice in a box
can you open it and you have powder and
you also have a spoolie a little brush
and pluck are things a tweezer I got
mine in the shade light to medium I
think this is perfect to travel with
it's like a cute little kit and then
this I know that this is new and I'm so
I'm excited for this
this is their new brow stylist definer
and I got mine in brunette and it's
pretty much it looks identical to like
the brow is it has the spoolie on one
side and then it has the product on the
other its retractable like you know I am
so excited to try this okay so my next
product I am very like itchy to try
because well heels like so this is the
Garnier skin active micellar cleansing
water I am in love with Bioderma I've
gone through like three I'm on my third
bottle I think Bioderma is fantastic
it's my favorite way to remove my makeup
so when simple came out with their
micellar water I bought it and it burned
the living out of my eyes I didn't like
the simple one I liked it for my entire
face but not for my eyes and bio-german
never stings my eyes we're all different
to me Bioderma is amazing on my
sensitive skin the simple one not so
much so I saw that Garnier came out with
one and I want to try this one because
maybe it's better than the simple one
maybe it's comparable to my Bioderma so
i wuold it yeah okay so let's move on to
Milani there were new releases from
Milani they came out with two new
primers they're called the prime
perfection face primers I got this one
because it says hydrating and pore
minimizing its oil free the other one is
black and it says mattifying I believe
which of course I don't need that so I
got the hydrating one I haven't tried
out yet but we'll see if it's hydrating
and then they came out with eyeshadow
palette I was so excited to see that
they came out I shadow palettes because
the you know the drugstore lacks and
palettes a lot of companies at the
drugstore have been coming out with
palettes recently and I have not been
impressed the Revlon ones are ok after
playing with them a little bit more
they're alright but these are really
good ok so I got this one this one is
earthy elements it has a lot of warm
colors I will say about this one though
this one like broke and I like squished
it back into the thing Tommy be a little
gentle with them and I actually really
like the the little brushes that come
with it so that one's earthy elements
this one is bare necessities really
pretty also like neutral colors
then the last one I picked up is this
one called plum basics and it's just
full of really really pretty
neutral colors with a little bit of
Purple's put on in there so I haven't
tried this one on my eyes but I have a
combination of these two on my eyes
right now I have this color in my crease
right now and I think that's it that I
have from this palette this is a great
palette this color right here though the
one that broke is garbage this color is
pure glitter there's no pigment to this
one I'm sorry about like flipping off
this one has no pigment I was so
disappointed with this color right here
but the rest of them are really really
nice but surprisingly in this palette
the bare necessities this first shade
right here is beautiful it's the color
having my inner corners right now it's
very brightening it's gorgeous I love
love love this one I have this one in my
crease this gold one all over my entire
lid then I have this one and my lower
lashline that's all I have down here and
in my crease and my outer corners this
dark brown is heaven-sent
and hopefully this purple one it's just
as good because I'm very impressed okay
one product I am not into at all I
bought it just to test it out it just
seems very like little kiddush to me I
don't know this is their raspberry oil
infused lip treatment actually this one
is raspberry infused they're all
different they're all infused with like
different things this one is called
nourishing raspberry I got it to see if
it was similar to the YSL Tintin oils
and it just felt so oily on my lips it
felt a little bit thick I will play
around with it more you know to see how
it hydrates but it just kind of threw me
off at first so I'm not a big fan so far
and then I got the Milani prep set and
go transparent face powder this is what
I used to set my under eye concealer
today and it was pretty freakin
transparent I don't think that it looked
too white I took a flash like a picture
with a flash and I don't notice a crazy
flash back I got to play around with it
more but I ended up using the wet and
wild duo like the lighter shade to
brighten up a little bit more because
this was just completely transparent
which is good which is amazing I'm glad
that there's no like white ish inist to
this but again I got
play around with it a little bit more
okay so we are almost done
all Mae came out with a bunch of new
lipsticks at least I think so I've never
seen these lipsticks before Rimmel I'm
scuse me nah tell me what the heck else
we're Rimmel came out with a bunch of
your lipsticks and I don't think I've
seen these before and it was a new
display so I'm gonna someday know I have
mine in knotty nude it's a really pretty
pink mauve it comes off like more pink
on my lips it's not as mom as I thought
it was gonna be when I smell it in the
tube I don't like the scent but as I'm
applying it it smells like very very
fruity it's a little bit strong I will
say that the scent is pretty strong but
I really like the color it seems very
very hydrating I do like the formula I
don't know what these are called like I
don't know if they're like the new
hydrating lipsticks or what I don't know
but I saw them live out one and then
covergirl came out with like three new
true blend blushes and this is the only
one I picked up because one of them was
sold out completely and the other one
was like too dark so I got mine in light
rose and I really really really loved
this blush I used it the other day and
it just gave me a nice peachy soft like
glow to my cheeks I liked it okay so the
last few products are from Physicians
Formula actually these two are exactly
the same but I didn't know what color to
get because obviously this is what I
don't like okay so these are the new
Physicians Formula mineral wear cushion
foundations I snapped about them I got
mine there's only three colors which con
come on Physicians Formula come on
L'Oreal just came out with a cushion
foundation and they came out with like a
ton of colors I think so they only have
three
this one is light/medium and this one is
a medium I got them both because I
didn't know if like medium was gonna be
like pink you know so I'm not exactly
let me open them right now actually so I
asked you guys on snapchat if you guys
wanted to see I really like this
packaging I think it's kind of cool
if you guys wanted to see like a half
face application what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna do a whole video dedicated to
these and in half of my face I'm gonna
apply the L'Oreal cushion and on the
other half I'm gonna apply the
Physicians Formula and I hope the color
is not too off because that would be
wickedly embarrassing so I'm gonna apply
both of them and then I'm gonna see I'm
going to do like a wear test which one
last longer which one just feels better
you know like
whole comparison between the two like
cushion foundations at the drugstore so
yes okay let's see this is light medium
and it looks just like the l'oreal one
has like the little thingy thing little
cover here okay so it's watching the
light medium look this is light medium
they didn't have a light maybe it was
just sold out so I didn't see it and now
that I look at it they probably do have
one titled or like labeled light that
would make sense wouldn't it so maybe
there are four colors this one seems a
little a little bit dark for me though I
don't know haha yep for sure
for sure this medium one is not gonna
put me yeah I picked this up and that's
the video I'm thinking about doing let
me know what you think then the last
product I got is also from Physicians
Formula and it is their super baby
instead II bronzer I got mine in the
shade bronzer I think there's only one
shade and I love positions formula
bronzers the bronze booster is my
favorite drugstore bronzer um so I
really was intrigued by this little guy
right here I just think their packaging
is so bulky oh this is very light oh wow
this is super light I don't know how
somebody with a deeper skin tone or much
deeper than me would feel about this cuz
it's pretty light it's right there I
don't know maybe I'll feel differently
once I put it on my face okay guys so
that was everything I got at Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works and Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond not Bath and
Body Works and Walgreens the other day
leave me a comment down below giving me
