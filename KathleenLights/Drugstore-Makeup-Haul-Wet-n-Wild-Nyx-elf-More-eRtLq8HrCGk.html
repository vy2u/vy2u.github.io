a drugstore haul I mentioned in a recent
video that I purchased a ton of things
off of Walgreens and Sephora I did some
damage when it came to drugstore and
high-end but I realized I had so many
things that I'm gonna split this video
up into two separate videos this is the
drugstore ha I will be doing a whole
Sephora haul still waiting for a couple
more things to come in the mail but I
should be uploading a Sephora haul soon
but for today's video we are going to
discuss all the drugstore products I
recently purchased I got some things off
of the Ulta website I also ordered
things off of the NYX website so I got
some NYX goodies elf goodies random
websites but all drugstore makeup so I
got a ton of wet and wild products
because I want my next one brand
tutorial to be focused around wet and
wild so I picked up some things I needed
to complete like a full face of makeup
I'm not wearing lipstick what I picked
up my primer by Wet n Wild because I
didn't have one this is the way mild
coverall primer it's supposed to be like
a typical pore filling primary has like
that silicone II feeling I used it
yesterday for the first time and it's
not too silicone ease so I liked that
and it just felt like a moisturizer on
my face it says it even skin tone and
brightens complexion but I didn't notice
that at all it's just kind of like a
nice base underneath makeup and then to
go along with that I didn't have a
wedding Wilde foundation so I picked up
the coverall cream foundation this is
the foundation I'm wearing on my skin
right now and I thought I was going to
hate this this is in the shade a fair /
light which PS is not fair I can't
believe this was labeled fair because
this is my color now that I have kind of
a tan medium to full coverage
lightweight satin matte finish all-day
wear surprisingly I actually like this I
wouldn't say it has full coverage I
would say it's a medium coverage but
even though it's a thick cream
foundation it doesn't look cakey on my
skin I don't know how I mean I applied
it with a damp sponge and I really like
findit out that way because with a brush
this looks too thick I use the brush
yesterday and it was too much but with a
Beauty Blender I actually like how it
makes my skin look super impressed I
also didn't have a
stealer for a full-face wet-and-wild
video so i picked up two concealers this
is the cover all liquid concealer and I
do not like this at all this made my
under eyes look so dry and when I swatch
this on the back of my hand its liquidy
it's not thick it's not cakey but wow it
just really emphasized every single line
I have right under here like it
emphasized lines I didn't even know I
had for my skin type it just it did not
work but this concealer this is the
other one I picked up you know just in
case this is the come correct celebrity
concealer also by Wet n Wild this is
very very thick unlike that one this one
is thick it reminds me so much like
where is it it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye it even looks like it has
similar packaging I think they were
trying to do something there it has a
similar consistency to that and as soon
as I put it on I was like oh my gosh
this is gonna be awful but I actually
ended up liking it it covers your
deepest secrets okay and you need just
the tiniest bit and definitely blend
this out with a sponge cuz with a brush
it was looking a little bit cakey but
when I blended it in with a sponge and
it really worked up in there you got a
really blend it out I ended up liking it
I also didn't have a wet and wild
bronzer I had the color icon bronzer in
ticket to Brazil but it shattered so I
picked up the same kind of bronzer
another color icon bronzer but this one
is in the shade bikini contest and I
kind of regret getting this color I
should have gotten ticket to Brazil but
I just wanted to try something different
this one is a little bit too red for me
I love these bronzers ticket to Brazil
is lighter it is a warm bronzer but it's
so beautiful this one is a little bit
too red for my liking it's the bronzer
I'm wearing on my face right now I have
it mixed in with another bronzer that I
also bought but love the formula on
these bronzers I need to go pick up
ticket to Brazil before my one read
story because I definitely like that one
more than this one I have heard amazing
things about this this is the Wet n Wild
photo focus eyes shadow primer and I
heard that it's comparable to the Mac
eye base but I hear that this is kind of
a dupe
tried it yesterday for the first time
and it is very sticky like you
definitely have to Pat this in and set
it with the powder because if not it
will just be a little bit too sticky my
eye shadow lasted all day when I use
this and this is only a few dollars so
this could be a very good eye shadow
primer I just got to use it a little bit
more this lipstick can't wait to talk
about it have a few things to say and
then the last one and wild products I
picked up I got online and I honestly
bought it because I was like wait a
minute what this is the wet and wild
shimmer palette and highlight in the
shade boozy brunch now this is what it
looks like I know what you're thinking
that looks identical to Hollywood
Boulevard also by Wet n Wild and you are
almost certainly right they're the exact
same product only now I guess they
changed it to boozy brunch that's the
new name of it and I'm guessing like the
Fergie products are limited edition I
guess everybody was so excessive age us
came out with it again and named it
something else so if you've been wanting
to pick up Hollywood Boulevard go online
boozy brunch is the same highlight so
yeah so the other bronzer I bought is an
oldie but a goodie I used to have this
so long ago like when I first not so
long ago but when I first started my
channel this is the NYC smooth skin
bronzer in the shade
sunny and I realized I just didn't
happen anymore because I hit pan and I
like went through it and I never
repurchased it but it's like 2 bucks and
I thought that I needed it again in my
collection don't know why but I did and
this is the other bronzer I have on my
face it is a very very warm bronzer but
it's so inexpensive it looks so good in
the summer time and I don't remember it
having this packaging II
I don't remember day now I'm gonna talk
about something that blew my frickin
socks off like they just like as soon as
I try this on my face like my socks just
flew off this is the most freakin
stunning freaking highlight ever I
bought this at Ulta and I'm getting like
so excited because I feel like every
single person who can get essence where
they live needs to go out find this and
buy it this is from the brand essence
and this is their pure nude highlighter
in the shade be my highlight number 10 I
think they only have one
a because this is the only one I saw on
the Ulta website and when I first got
this in the mail like look at this this
kind of looks like a face powder when I
first got this in the mail I was like oh
that's gonna be too dark or that's just
gonna look like nothing on my face cuz
there's no Sheen to this nothing but
this is the highlight I'm wearing on my
frickin face right now guys like what I
am in love with this highlight this is
very BAM but it's not shimmery like it
almost looks matte in the pan I don't
know how to explain this formula it
reminds me a lot of my Laura Mercier
matte baked highlight and zero one only
that one is like a pearly white this is
like a golden sheen but it's not like
golden saiga oh my gosh I don't know how
to explain it so watching it does it
zero justice you have to put this on
your face and you're gonna be like what
I will say though if you are very very
very fair this might be too dark for you
like it'll show up kind of like a stripe
on your face because when I got it in
the mail I hadn't had a tan yet like I
got this tan over the fourth of July and
now with my tan it looks extra beautiful
like so pretty I freaking love oh it's
so much I got this on my smart jccc
luminous primer it has SPF 15 and I
don't know if I like this I used it
today for the first time and it pretty
much just felt like I was putting on a
moisturizer like there was nothing much
to it says it's a complexion correcting
primer and I don't know I have to play
around with it a little bit more it
didn't feel nice and moisturizing like
the foundation laid really nicely on top
of it two products I picked up recently
from Maybelline they have these new
color tattoo I chromes they have a ton
of different colors I just picked up one
this is gilded rose and these will last
through a mother effin hurricane these
are so like permanent on your eyelids
almost to the point where I kind of
don't love it like this for me it was
kind of hard to blend out like I have
used this on top of my when Wilde primer
and then when I set my wet and wild
primer like with a translucent powder
and I tried to put this on top of the
translucent powder it was a hot mess it
did not blend it got so splotchy I got
so patchy horrible
this is something I have to use without
a primer without anything on my lids
because if not it gets a little bit
patchy which is okay though because it
does last a really long time so I don't
need a primer and then I got this and I
was so skeptical about this I still AM
but I really want to try this out I
haven't I was going to use it today and
then I completely forgot this is the
Maybelline master contour buy face
Studio v-shaped duo stick so on one side
you have your contour and then on the
other side you have your highlight and I
totally feel like this is a little bit
gimmicky because if you use this a
little bit recklessly like if you go to
paint the contour on your face and then
you turn it over and start highlighting
once the nubbin thing wears down you
might get some contour color in your
highlight product or vice versa like it
might get a little bit too messy but
that's just like my thoughts I don't
know if that's actually true I will play
along with this if it does get a little
bit messy I'll just use the contour only
because I have a feeling I might not
like the highlighting side because it
might be a little bit too drying for my
skin but we shall see so I wanted to
pick up a translucent powder from the
drugstore that wasn't loose like I have
my NYC loose translucent powder that I
am so loving but I wanted one that
wasn't loose you know so I got this this
is the Physicians Formula gentle where
pressed powder it says 100% natural
origin 15 percent organic this is in the
shade translucent medium it's in this
light cool like eco-friendly packaging
and then it has the mirror on one side
which is nice and it comes with this
little brush that I really don't use but
this is a really nice mirror and then on
the other side you have your powder I
used it today to set my under eye
concealer and then I also used it to set
my entire face and I love it it's a very
nice light just natural powder and it
didn't look cakey or like too heavy on
my skin it set my face really nicely
didn't look like I was layering powder
so I was really really impressed the
only thing I will say is it kind of
lightens your foundation like it's
translucent but if you put too much it
will definitely make your foundation
look a little bit lighter so keep that
in mind okay so moving on the
these products or Elle and Knicks let's
just talk about the elf stuff because
it's not a lot of stuff these are their
aqua beauty molten liquid eyeshadows
similar concepts to the color tattoo
liquid ones by Maybelline but obviously
actually not a similar concept because
those are like color tattoos and these
are more just like liquid eyeshadows I
don't think they're meant to last a
really long time on your eyes but they
have a really nice creamy formula this
one is called brushed copper and I'm
actually wearing this one on the inner
parts of my eyes right now I layered it
on top of powder it was easy to blend
you might have to build up the color a
little bit but I don't mind because it
was just really easy to work with so
that's blush copper and then I also got
molten bronze which is a really pretty
bronze shade haven't tried this one yet
but really excited to use it like I'm a
smoky eye so I've got these two little
things and then I got two lip lacquers
from ELF this one is in natural and then
this one is in bold pink I don't know
why I picked this up I feel like maybe I
thought this would be great for like a
summer tutorial like with a nice bold
pink lip and then of course nude eye
like who doesn't love new really excited
to try these maybe they're similar to
the lip lacquers from flower beauty that
I'm like obsessed with haven't tried
these out yet obviously they're still in
this packaging but let me give it a
little swatch it's a very shiny very
glossy a la shiny
I'm glitzy really excited to try these
out paired like on top of a lip liner
this is the highlighting dewy drops in
the shade illuminating saw this on the
website and I was like doing drops what
is that I haven't tried this out yet I
don't even know I've never even swatches
I don't even know like the texture or
anything I hate what I hate when brands
do this like they just put the name on
the packaging not on the actual - oh
yeah okay well it says illuminating on
the bottom but it doesn't say what it is
Oh what
heck there's like a lot of oil collected
at the tip okay so oh nice
this is really really pretty you have to
shake this up when you squeeze it off
for the first time you're like what it's
just pure oil but this looks like a
really beautiful liquid highlight this
would probably look amazing mixed in
with foundation because it doesn't feel
too thick or oily look how pretty that
is okay and then the rest of the
products aren't Nicks stuff let's get
these eyeshadow palettes out of the way
because the rest of the NYX products are
lip products these are the NYX ultimate
shadow palettes I didn't even know they
had this but I was just browsing the NYX
website and they seemed to be new this
one is the cool neutrals palette which
is exactly what it says you have like a
ton of neutrals but more cool tone
shadows with your pops of color there as
well I haven't tried this eyeshadow
palette yet so I don't have any thoughts
on this one but I am wearing this one on
my eyes right now this one is the warm
neutrals palette the matte eyeshadows in
this palette are amazing I'm wearing all
of the matte shades on the outer corners
of my eyes right now so beautiful it
didn't have any problems blending out
the matte shadows really really really
high-quality but oh my gosh the shimmer
shades in this palette are terrible like
look at this look at this this is the
gold one right here like where like like
where is the pigment I added the elf
molten liquid shadow on the inner
corners of my eyes because none of these
shimmer shades were doing it for me the
only one I do like is this one right
here this one is very pigmented it's the
one I have in my inner corners right now
just not very good shimmer shades in
this palette but I still think it's
worth it because there are a lot of
matte shades in this palette so yeah let
me know what you think about these
palettes I would like to know your
opinion on them and then I got some lip
products these are the new NYX cosmic
metals lip creams I know that metallic
lips are like all the rage right now and
some people hate them some people love
them I don't know how I feel about them
I kind of like them but I don't know I
don't know so
I got three bold colors maybe for like a
fun makeup tutorial this orange one is
called solar energy I thought this would
be a really fun look for summer and then
I'm like really into blue lipstick right
now it's like a thing I don't know why
this one is called celestial star it's a
very shimmery amazing blue and then as
soon as I saw this one I was like that
looks just like the new Kylie Jenner
metallic liquid lipstick in the shade hi
majesty this one is called galactic and
I actually purchased my majesty
to see if it was a dupe okay this is Kai
majesty and this one is galactic hi
Majesty definitely looks more intense
and deeper I still want to swatch them
because if you don't want to buy a Kylie
Jenner lip but you want a similar effect
why not I actually don't think that
these lip creams dry down matte they're
not liquidy they're more moosie and they
don't claim to be matte either like they
don't claim to be a liquid lipstick so
yeah this one is kind majesty and this
one is galactic so similar time actually
is darker though but so similar
definitely different formulas I think I
haven't tried que majesty on my lips yet
but I think these do dry it completely
matte okay and then I picked up these
two guys right here these are new on the
website I believe and these are the NYX
plush gel lipsticks I got mine in this
shade which is the one I'm wearing on my
mouth right now on my lips nude beach
and then this one is more pink and it's
called dime piece now I just tried it on
today for the first time actually like
right now like in the beginning of this
video and I love the texture so creamy
and delicious on the lips seriously love
the finish love the texture love the
color but oh my god I can't deal with
the way that this tastes it smells very
very chemically and it tastes kind of
chemically but the second I put this on
my lips you know what this tastes like
this tastes like a pool floatie I don't
know how I would know what a pool
floatie tastes like but immediately for
some strange reason that's the first
thing that came into my mind and usually
I don't mind that because a lot of the
times when something smells kind of came
out chemically it will fade but I have
been sitting
wearing this throughout the entire video
and it's hurting my throat like my
throat hurts and it's kind of tripping
me out like I'm not gonna lie I feel
like I've been eating some of this and
it's hurting my throat and I almost feel
like it's giving me a toothache I'm just
like dying to wipe my mouth off which
kind of sucks because I know for that
reason I will never put these on my lips
ever again but yeah anyway that
completes this video let me know if
you've tried any of these products if
there's something else from the
drugstore that recently came out or
something that you want me to try it let
me know down below and I'll look into it
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video
hi oh this does not taste good oh this
damn thing but I hadn't had a tea I had
a head out why bro why Porter bro come
on man he's just a freakin guy walking
his dog I got my lips tastes disgusting
