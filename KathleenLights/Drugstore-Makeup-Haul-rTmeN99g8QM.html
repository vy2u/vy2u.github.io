a drugstore haul I put all my goodies
here in this box I was recently on
Target and Walmart calm and I was just
looking through the drugstore stuff and
I realized that I don't really have much
of the brands that are specifically sold
they're like I don't have that much
Sonia Kashuk stuff and I really don't
have hard candy or flower beauty in my
collection which if you don't know hard
candy is a drugstore brand specifically
sold at Walmart and so it's flower
beauty owned by Drew Barrymore
specifically sold at Walmart and then
Sonia Kashuk is exclusive to target so I
decided to do some drugstore shopping
and pick up products that I've never
tried before so I know it's random I
mean some of these brands I have tried
before but a lot of this is new to me
like you know side note I just got back
from Vegas and I really had to say thank
you in the beginning of this video I
know that this video has nothing to do
with Las Vegas but the past week you
have seen pre-recorded videos I filmed
them before I left for Vegas but if you
guys follow me on social media like
Twitter snapchat Instagram you know I
was in Las Vegas and I just want to say
thank you to everyone who was commenting
on my pictures like I could not believe
it I filmed a video all about like my
fears and that was a cat jets video and
I told you guys like my incredible fear
of flying and I'm just working so hard
to push through it and reading the
comments I like sat in my hotel room and
I cried the fact that you guys were
saying that you were so proud of me for
actually getting on the plane and going
out there and going to the Grand Canyon
you guys made me feel so good and even
though I was like a nervous wreck on the
way back and on the way to like you guys
just I thought about you guys in your
positive board so thank you thank you
thank you to everyone who said that they
were proud of me and like it means so
much you guys are living the best
subscribers on the face of the planet
okay I don't want to make this video too
long I will be doing a cat chats video
about Vegas we had a very wild night on
Friday and I'm gonna do a whole cat
chats about it but for now let's get
into Z products I recently purchased I
actually own this before this is the elf
complexion brush I was looking at my old
video where I talked about my favorite
drugstore brushes and I was like oh my
gosh I lost that brush and it was like
my favorite bronzer brush
had to buy a new one because I have no
idea where mine went this looks so
similar to like that famous mac brush
like for bronzing so similar so sheep so
like I said earlier I bought a couple
things from the brand hard candy and I'm
gonna share of those with you first this
is the hard candy look Pro illuminating
strobing mix in drops it says use alone
or mixing products for instant radiance
I haven't tried this out yet this
packaging is always so weird like why is
it in this I think I was like when I was
a young kid opening up a Barbie or
something I don't know I was really
excited when I saw this on the website I
purchased all of this online when I was
born one day and this is in the shade
white pearl I'm really really excited I
think this would be awesome to mix in
with foundation I hope it's not glittery
though looks a little glittery oh my
gosh not glittery at all wow I mean
there is like a very slight shimmer but
it's not glittery but I'm very very very
excited for this and I know this was
super affordable next up from hard candy
is this lip gloss right here I actually
got a couple of lip glosses I've been
into a glossy lip recently don't know I
know that's weird I'm usually a matte
gal but this is the hard candy plumping
serum volumizing lip gloss supposedly
this is nice and plumping for your lips
I hope it doesn't sting this is in the
shade Swan Lake on the back of my hand
it does look pretty sheer like there's
not much color to it at all but it might
be a nice like lipstick topper the last
thing I got from hard candy it is their
12 hour radiance primer mist so excited
when I saw this on the website oil free
silicone free and alcohol free which is
awesome electrolytes energize and
hydrate skin I am so excited to use this
I haven't used this yet but I'm very
very very excited let me know in the
comments if you guys want me to do like
an update in about two weeks
tell you how I liked everything like you
know kind of like a drugstore update
definitely let me know even though it's
a primer I'm going to spray it
the mist could be a little bit more fine
it's a little bit squirty just a little
bit but I can look past that because
it's a primer mist you know it goes
under no big deal I got two foundation
type products one is a BB cream and one
is a CC cream I get really excited for
these kinds of products this time of
year I love I love it I got the Pacifica
ultra CC cream radiant foundation
broad-spectrum SPF 17 can you see this
box it says moisture rich color
correcting makeup and skincare with
coconut water for all skin types
I don't know if I got my exact my right
shade I got the shade natural / medium
and I haven't used this yet but whoa
whoa whoa
does a little dork but this might be
actually perfect when I'm self-tanning
like when I have a fresh self tan on so
yes very excited actually felt very
creamy on the back of my hand so I'm
excited for this the other thing I got
is the Physicians Formula
Organic wear BB cream all-in-one beauty
balm 100% natural and it says it has
skin nourishing coconut cocktail
whatever that means
oh and it's SPF 20 so this is what I'm
wearing on my face right now I actually
picked this up because I heard my friend
Alana talking about it I think this is
the one she talks about and she says
really good things so I picked mine up I
have the shade light/medium it's what
I'm wearing right now when I'm at my
fairest this is definitely too dark for
me but I've had self tanner on for like
about a week now so it's like halfway to
fading so it's fine I like matches me
fine right now I really like this it
felt super hydrating going on my skin it
didn't really sink into any of my lines
I really liked the coverage for a BB
cream it has pretty great coverage for a
BB cream and I'm pretty sure this is a
physical sunscreen so I love it this is
the flower brightening concealer now I
feel weird every time I say concealer
because I get a lot of comments like oh
my gosh you say concealer weird and I'm
like concealer concealer
I use this for the first time today
that's why it's like secretly open I
really really like this this is very
similar to like the Wet n Wild
Illuminati highlighting pen the L'Oreal
one the YSL Touche clot like it's very
similar to those types of concealers are
really liked it it's what I have
underneath my eyes today the coverage is
pretty decent it's not like super full
coverage but it's nice for like day to
day wear okay so I have been eyeing this
product for so long the NYX honey do me
up this is kind of like a primer if you
guys are familiar with the YSL one that
has like gold flakes in it I don't know
what the name is but it's a wire so
primer that looks just like this with
gold flakes there's even a girl on once
I decided to try the drugstore version
first it has honey in it and real gold
flakes it's supposed to be like very
hydrating and it has collagen and all
this good stuff I traded today on my
face as a primer for the first time and
I really liked it hydrate in my skin but
it didn't feel oily I was really afraid
that I was gonna be thick and oily but
it's not this is the blush I'm actually
wearing right now this is the Physicians
Formula happy booster glow and mood
boosting blush I think this is the only
shade they have oh it says natural so
this is the shade natural
it's little heart it's so cute this
isn't new by any means I don't think
anything I'm talking about that it is
new I was just browsing I love this
blush I'm wearing it today and it's not
matte but it's not shimmery it's like
the perfect in-between it literally does
give your face a glow like a really
pinky natural pretty glow it's au
natural alright
I actually got another Physicians
Formula blush let me go ahead and show
you that one this one though I bought
this one on Amazon because I'm pretty
sure I heard Ready Set glamour talking
about this blush and I wanted it so bad
I couldn't find it anywhere I resulted
to Amazon and I found it on Amazon this
is the mineral where talc free
airbrushing blush 16-hour airbrush
finish it says smoothing firming and
lifting effect I don't know about all
that but this is also in the shade
natural this one is actually very
different than the other one this is
more of a matte blush and I feel like
depending on your makeup it can pull a
little bit more cool or a little bit
warmer but I really like the color you
can find it on Amazon if you are
interested I got these little chubby
sticks because they remind me of the
Revlon ones I used to have the just
kissable balm scenes but they were so
old I got rid of a bunch of them or
them actually these are the flower lip
tints and they are the shiny bomb sheer
tint of color and I'm actually wearing
this one on my lips right now this is
sheer blossom this one surprised me like
when I took this out this has a ton of
silver glitter in this product like
silver glitter and it's a very cool
toned mob nude like very very cool tone
and I surprisingly really like this it's
what I'm wearing underneath my lip gloss
right now just kind of like a sheer wash
you would think like the glitter and
like the the grayness in this lip would
like I don't I don't know I really like
it that's weird
I know but I do interesting color I
didn't think I would like but I do and
then this one is called bear blush which
is pretty much just like a really pretty
sheer spring pink this is another
product I picked up from Amazon because
when I saw it it reminded me so much of
the benefit give me brow that I wanted
to see if it was a dupe this is the
essence make me brow eyebrow mascara it
pretty much has the exact same packaging
as the benefit gimme brow or like the
old packaging because benefit changed
the packaging of the gimme brow and
that's pretty much the same one like the
same thing and it's so much cheaper this
is literally give me ro the only thing I
will say I'm wearing it on my eyebrows
right now on top of a pencil it's super
ashy just like the gimme brow is like
really ashy somebody was like warmth in
their hair can't wear this for those of
you who do have like cooler tones in
your hair this will be perfect for you
I got some Sonia Kashuk stuff off of
Target this is the Sonia Kashuk all
cover up concealer I got mine in the
shade ivory I've actually heard really
really great things about this concealer
like I've heard people rave about it so
I decided to pick it up hopefully I
picked up my correct shade not bad not
bad I could probably make that work
wow this is very me I'm actually
surprised by the consistency usually pop
things like this are a little bit thick
but that was pretty easy to blend out so
I'm excited to try that I got another
blush I'm like on a blush kick this is
the Sonia Kashuk beautifying blush in
the shade pink rose a nice dusty pink
was very light very light you guys know
I don't like like a super intense blush
so I have a feeling I'm gonna love this
and then I got another eyebrow Joe this
is the tinted brow gel by Sonia Kashuk I
don't know why I got this I just saw it
decided to pick it up this looks hella
ashy though I did not know wow wow
I didn't noticed buying this on the
website that it was so Ashley what
colors this is little Bobby Lee goes I
don't know what color this is maybe I
bought an ashy color but I'll try it out
anyway and let you know okay and then
the last products I got are from flower
beauty I was not happy with this this is
the only thing in the hall that I was
like aunt not my favorite this is the
zoom in mascara I tried it today for the
first time and this is supposed to give
you length thickness and curl your
lashes which I know is crazy it's like a
lot of claims but that's why I bought it
because I was like wow this could wait a
minute oh my gosh I did not know this
okay I just realized at the top of this
mascara it says twist it you can twist
this at the top to make it different
I'm so dumb okay so when I first used
this this morning I took it out and I
was like wow that isn't a fad inor look
at the Sun that is an enormous brush and
then I was putting it through my lashes
and I was like oh it's alright well
through my good lashes right here you
guys know I burned these off smelling a
candle so I was putting it through my
lashes and I was like this isn't really
doing much for me the bristles seem very
separated not my favorite but I just
noticed huh when you twist it the thing
turns oh my god and when you twist it a
third time I get shorter Wow
come on stubby little critters let's try
for Mama come on so okay my opinion just
totally changed on this this is so cool
so when you first take out of the one
it's like look oh cool it's like this
and then this lengthen take it out
you've run it through your lashes and
that's going to lengthen it and then you
twist it one time and that's going to
curl your lashes and then when you twist
it a third time it like twists it and
then this is gonna fall you mize I'm
gonna give it more of a shot wear it and
I will let you know
and the last e-products i got our lip
glosses from flower beauty or flower
cosmetics or just flower this is the one
I'm wearing right now this is the shine
on lip glosses this is in the shade
baby's breath I wore I put it on a while
ago so I have mixed feelings about this
I really like this color it doesn't last
too long so I put it on like two hours
ago so kind of faded a little bit it's
not sticky which I really like about
this gloss the only thing I don't truly
love besides the longevity is it's not
very glossy like when I put it on my
lips don't look glossy it says shine on
lip gloss I thought I was gonna be like
really shiny but it's just like not as
glossy as I would like it but it doesn't
mean I don't like it and then I got two
more colors I haven't tried these yet so
maybe I will feel differently about
these this peachy nude one is called
what a daisy
it's like a creamsicle orange e shade
and then this one is called pretty in
petunia which is a nice like poppy coral
e shade okay so that is it these are the
products I recently bought online when I
was bored since I've never really tried
any of these products like not really
besides first impressions leave me a
comment down below if there's anything
