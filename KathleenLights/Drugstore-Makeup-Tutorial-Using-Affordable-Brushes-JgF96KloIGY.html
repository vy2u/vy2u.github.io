tutorial on me look I'm wearing right
now it is a full face drugstore makeup
tutorial so everything on my face you
can find at the drugstore and I'm also
using affordable brushes as well one of
these brushes are expensive they're all
affordable by the way I'm totally loving
these wet and wild brushes they're
extremely high qualit quality they're
quality high quality and so inexpensive
so anyway if you want to see how to get
this really pretty purpley eyeshadow
look using the brand new Milani palette
and plum basics and just keep watching
so I wanted to show you I use drugstore
products on my brows i use the laurio
brow stylist definer and the easy brow
by Milani and now I'm going to jump in
today's tutorial I'm gonna prime my face
with the Maybelline master Prime in
smoothing and then I'm going to go over
it with the color tattoo these are like
the new color tattoos that are in a
stick chubby form they're pretty good I
have to see I like the pots just a
little bit better and I'm just blending
that out with a real techniques brush
then I'm going to go into the Milani
palette I'm pretty sure it's called plum
basics I'm not sure I'll have all the
names of everything listed below but I'm
gonna take a crease brush this is from
LA Colors this brush was like $2 at the
Family Dollar and it came with another
brush it's a really great brush by LA
colors so I'm just buffing this into my
crease and then I'm gonna take this
shade right here it's a matte vanilla
shade and I'm taking my little Dell iam
tools brush this is a 7 7 6 it's really
similar to a mac 217 and then I'm gonna
go back into that gray color I used
earlier and I'm gonna start buffing this
and blending this in this is a morphe
what is it mb 23 very inexpensive now
with my little elf $1 brush I'm going to
dip it into that purple and I'm going to
start
applying this color to my entire anti or
lid so I'm gonna put like a pop of color
on the center of my eyeball and I want
it to really really stick so I'm taking
my ELF glitter primer and I'm applying
just a little bit of that right in the
center so that the eye shadow I put down
really sticks to it and I'm gonna take
this eye shadow right here it's super
glittery and beautiful but it needs a
very sticky base because if not it's not
that pigmented and the brush I'm using
is new from Wet n Wild and it is their
small concealer brush and I really like
this for packing on pigments or things
like that I went back in with my little
elf brush and back into that purple and
I just intensified everything in case it
got blended away and then back into that
morphe brush and just blended things out
so for eyeliner I'm gonna do a very very
very thin line if this is the wet and
wild felt tip eyeliner and this is in
black so I just you know created a
little wing and then filled it all in so
I'm gonna move on to what up just
kidding I'm gonna take my L'Oreal matt
mattox eyeliner and tight line with this
before I move on to my face okay so now
I'm in a prime this is the Milani prime
perfection this is the hydrating one
they have one for oily skin but since I
have dry skin I chose this one and then
I'm going to go in with this foundation
this is the Rimmel wake me up foundation
but it's a little too dark for me and I
know that this product is in drugstore
this is the body shop lightening thing
that's like too light in your foundation
and I know that isn't drugstore but I
didn't have a drugstore foundation
that's as white as I am currently so I
had to mix it with those drops and then
I mix it all together and applied it to
my face the brush I'm using here is
amazing and I highly recommend every
single person to purchase it it's the
new wet and wild flat top kabuki I have
very little shedding it's amazing 20
times better than the new Revlon brushes
and the Revlon brushes are a lot more
expensive I highly recommend the wet and
wild brushes so now I'm going to apply
some concealer underneath my eyes
going to take the Rimmel wake me up
concealer in very light I believe it's
what shade I have and then on top of it
I'm going to take this new what in wild
Illuminati illuminating highlighter pen
and ivory into you that's the name of it
ivorian to you and I'm layering those
two together because I feel like the
Rimmel concealer is not light enough to
highlight and I'm just blending that in
with a real techniques contour brush
okay so I'm going to set that with my
Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35 creamy
natural and the brush I'm using to set
that is the Real Techniques setting
brush I'm setting everywhere I put the
concealer so underneath my eyes and
between my eyebrows my nose around my
mouth anywhere I put the concealer I
want to make sure I set it so it does
increase or get into the fine lines okay
back to the palette I'm taking a pencil
brush I could not find an affordable
pencil brush anywhere so this one is
from makeup geek and I just buffed that
gray color underneath my lower lash line
and then I took the L'Oreal Matt Matic
eyeliner again and I applied this to my
waterline I'm going to take this really
stunning matte purple in the palette and
I'm just gonna buff right over that grey
just to give it a little bit more
dimension and it looks a little bit
deeper and then I'm going to use this
cool little thing that what in wild came
out with it's like two mascaras one is a
regular mascara which you apply that
first and then you take this right here
which is like a fiber mascara it puts a
bunch of little white fibers all over
your lashes and then you go in with your
mascara one more time so it makes like
really really thick voluminous lashes I
don't know how I feel about it yet but I
don't hate it so that's good alright so
now I'm moving on to my face I didn't
even want to Bronx today for some reason
like I didn't want to apply much bronzer
or contour at all so I took this tiny
little stippling brush from Wet n Wild
and I dipped it into the cool shade in
my ELF contour palette and I'm just
lightly contouring my cheekbones just to
define them a little
but for some reason I wanted to be a
little bit more glowy than bronzed which
is really where rare and weird but I
went with it so after I contoured a
little bit I took this super BB or like
insta ready bronzer by Physicians
Formula it's a very very light shade it
doesn't have too much color payoff but I
really do like it and I'm applying that
with a wet and wild brush unfortunately
these brushes don't have names or
numbers on them but it's I think it's
the blush brush it's set it on the
packaging but I sit that way ok so now
my favorite part is highlighting I'm
taking my Physicians Formula shimmer
strip in Miami strip and I'm applying
that to the tops of my cheekbones with
this up-and-up brush from Target I love
this brush for highlighting it's almost
identical to the anastacio one but I
like it even more and it's a lot more
affordable so I'm highly not all over my
face all over my face I'm highlighting
and I'm going in with blush and this is
in the shade medium rose this blush is
from covergirl and I'm just applying
that to my cheeks with my Real
Techniques multi-task brush I love the
combination of this highlight and this
blush I just feel like it makes your
skin look fresh and glowy and simple
easy so I started filling in my entire
lips with this essence lip liner in the
shade in the nude one of my favorite lip
liners and it's like 2 dollars it's
amazing and then I topped it off with
this NYX lip gloss in the shade sugarpie
and then that completes this video I
hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much
