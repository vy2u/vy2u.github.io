hey guys so today's video is going to be
a makeup tutorial on this look it's
actually really similar to things I've
done in the past but I wanted to do a
like orangie bronzy smokey eye using
this eye shadow right here that I have
been using and loving these are the NYX
prismatic eyeshadows and I've always
thought that they were good but I didn't
realize how good they were
till recently Oh so you can want to
laughs i didn't highlight the inner
corner of this eye
okay let's ignore that I ended the video
without even doing that Wow if you
haven't tried these prismatic eyeshadows
by NYX they are probably one of the best
drugstore if not the best drugs yes they
are the best single eyeshadows at the
drugstore right now and I can't believe
I haven't been using I got them at IMATS
and I can't believe I haven't been using
them every single day so this is the
look I came up with it's I know it's
similar to things I've done but I wanted
to do a full face drugstore tutorial and
I wanted to do something that's perfect
for a night out especially now that
we're in this summer with a really like
eyeliner so if you want to get this look
then just keep watching I just quickly
wanted to show you guys that I did in my
eyebrows using drugstore products but
they take forever so I didn't show it I
use the elf brow Wiz and like the Loreal
brow mascara so now I'm moving on to
priming my eyelids i'm using the Jesse's
girl I shadow primer I purchased mine
off of Jessie's girls calm and I love it
I love this primer it really makes my
eyeshadows stick onto my lid I'm going
to use a base because I want the gold to
really pop underneath the eyeshadow so
this is a Milani eyeshadow stick not
sure what the name is but I'll have it
listed below now taking the NYX
prismatic eyeshadow in the shade bedroom
eyes I'm applying this to my entire lid
with a flat shader brush I'm not exactly
sure why I'm going so slow like I'm
applying this eyeshadow very slowly and
I do
why but I love the prismatic eyeshadows
if you don't own any please go out and
purchase them they're all good every
single one they're so intense they feel
very high-end and luxurious
then I'm taking this morphe fluffy brush
I like this one because it's very very
like small it's a small fluffy brush
this is the Sonia Kashuk eye on neutral
matte palette and I'm taking the orange
e color it reminds me a lot of a mixture
between makeup geeks chickadee and Peach
Smoothie it's like a nice warm
transition shade so I'm using this brush
to blend out the prismatic eyeshadow so
there are no harsh lines and to give
that extra little warmth to the crease
then I'm going to go into this brown
eyeshadow right here yes that one in the
palette with the same brush and I'm just
going to do the exact same thing because
I do want to add more Brown to it I
don't want it to be just like a straight
up orange crease even though I like that
I just want to add more Brown to the
crease there then I'm just taking a big
fluffy brush with no eyeshadow and
blending things out so there are no
harsh lines you know going into this
other prismatic eyeshadow in the shade
girl-talk and I'm applying this to my
brow bone just to give a little bit of
shine I don't want to apply too much
because this is a very pigmented
eyeshadow so I'm barely tapping it and
then I'm going into the white in the
palette and I'm applying that underneath
my brow bone I layered the other one
underneath that I didn't want it to be
just like a flat white shade so that's
why then I'm going to go into a brush
really similar to a Mac 217 it's like a
paddle fluffy blending brush and I'm
going to go back into that orange shade
and I'm really gonna start blowing out
that orange color like I decided I want
it to be a little bit more Orange E in
the crease you know ma style so yeah
that's just what I'm doing here going
back and forth with that color and then
I'm going to take this eyeliner from la
girl and I'm tight lining with this and
then I'm applying a little bit to my top
lashes just to just so I could look like
there's eyeliner there but there really
isn't so I'm going to finish off my
as I made my face before I finished my
eyes you know I'm priming my face with
the L'Oreal magic lumi light infusing
primer I believe that's what it's called
and then I'm going to go in with this
foundation I wanted to use it because I
haven't used in a long time I'm using
this elf buffer brush this is the
Neutrogena healthy mix foundation I'm in
the shade 40 even though mmm I noticed
it looks maybe a little too light but
it's okay bronzer can fix that
so I'm applying this to my whole face it
gives a nice radiant just like glowy
look without being too greasy or too
much I really like this foundation I
don't know why I don't use it more
because it's nice
then for concealer I decided to bust out
this la girl Pro conceal I haven't used
it a long time this is in the shade
creamy beige excuse me I'm singing
together this is creamy beige and I hate
the packaging I think I don't use this
as much because the packaging is just so
hard to squeeze this concealer out so it
drives me nuts but it's an amazing
concealer so I use it so I just started
blending all that out and then I
remembered hey this is not the brush I
like to use to blend I'm gonna grab my
Sedona lace 217 it's the perfect brush
to blend out my under-eye concealer I
love it but then I said wait wait - wait
wait and I've decided to plop on the
Maybelline magic lumi highlighting pen
this is in the shade ivory I like to
apply this on top of my concealer
because it's just brightens my under
eyes a lot more it's not opaque enough
or doesn't have enough coverage to be a
concealer on its own but I do like to
use it as a highlighter so that's what
I'm doing and then I'm just blending
everything out
I don't know what's wrong with me I'm
sorry but yes moving on so I've decided
to do cream products I'm I'm putting on
a bunch of cream products under my
powder products so I'm taking the Sonia
Kashuk cream bronzer enriched bronze I
like this one more than warm tan it's
just a little bit darker and not as like
orange looking so I'm applying this with
a makeup geek stippling brush and I'm
just kind of contouring with this and
then it falls OH I'd almost fell out of
my hand there anyway back to this oh my
god my roots are so terrible like I
cannot believe I haven't dyed my roots
yet I'm gonna do that soon but holy crap
they're so bad anyway I'm taking the
Real Techniques stippling brush and I'm
applying the elf cream blush in the
shade peach perfection to my cheeks and
I barely put anything on honestly this
step was pointless because I barely put
any blush on I wanted it to be mostly
bronzy then I'm going to take this
L'Oreal Lumi cream highlight this is in
the shade golden and I'm applying this
to my cheekbones I don't like the
powders in this line but I really like
the liquid illuminators that L'Oreal
just recently came out with so because I
hadn't set my concealer with powder I
blended it out with my finger just to
get rid of some of the creases and now
I'm going to set my under eye concealer
this is a NYX powder that I couldn't
open in the shade banana and this is
just like a paddle brush from zoeva and
I am setting my under eyes so that they
don't crease and they stay in place my
concealer there's a place
then I'm going to go ahead and bronze
with a powder bronzer now just like to
set everything this is a Jain bronzer in
the shade inspire and this is a morphe
brush from the elite collection and I am
just bronzing on my face I'm not doing
anything super crazy not contouring just
you know being in bronze II then I'm
going to take this highlighter slash
bronzer by Milani it's called fantastic
and gold and I applied my brush in like
the white sections just so I can add a
highlight to my cheeks because if I
would have applied it like in the bronze
II section it would've been too dark so
that is what I did and then I finished
off my eyes by applying that same brown
eyeliner to my waterline and then I
really got up in there and I just like a
plot I'm like blinking a lot because I
don't like to tug on my eyes but I
applied a thick layer of that to my
lower lashline a lot thicker than I
normally do and then I just kind of
blended it out with a brush just so that
everything can be nice and even
and then with a more dense pencil brush
I'm going to dip it into that orange
shade and just go over everything so it
doesn't look like a raccoon eye so that
everything is nice and blended and it
just looks smoky not like a harsh Brown
line then the mascara I'm using is from
Maybelline and this is their miss mango
rock mascara and I applied it to my top
and bottom lashes so to finish off this
look I just took the Revlon Super
Lustrous matte lipstick and smoked peach
and I decided I wanted it to be glossy
not matte and a little bit more pink not
so peach so I took the elf extra lip
gloss in the shade Brian and I just
applied it on top and then that
completes this makeup swirl I really
hope you guys enjoyed please subscribe

you in monos video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
