tutorial on this look right here I have
gotten so many requests throughout the
last few months to do a cut crease
makeup tutorial but every time I got
requested to do that I was like oh I
don't know how to do that and I always
felt so bad not doing one it was just
one of those looks that seemed
impossible to do for me like I've said
in the past 100 times I'm not a makeup
artist I just love doing my own makeup
and I know my strengths and I know my
weaknesses and I got to tell you cook
crease major weakness so I just started
doing my research and in my personal
opinion this is the easiest way to do a
cook crease I gotta say I was like you
know what I'm going to sit down and I'm
going to film a cut crease mega toriel
and I'm going to do it in a way where
it's the easiest for my subscribers and
I really feel like this is the easiest
way this isn't a new technique or
anything I've seen a hundred tutorials
where people do their cookies just like
this but then I've seen like a hundred
other ones where it's just so
complicated and so hard at least for me
so I found that this was the easiest way
that I could do one and it's trial and
error it's all about practice today was
the first time I sat down and I tried to
someone so it's not the best I mean
they're totally some crooked lines in
there it's not the most amazing cookies
on the internet but it's a good place to
start I'm going to practice more and
hopefully I get better and I learn new
technique and hopefully this video helps
you out if you are someone who can never
do a caprese like me hopefully this
tutorial will help you so yeah I've also
gotten a lot of requests to do another
tutorial using my morphe palette I'm
pretty sure you could still get your
hands on it so that is what's on my eyes
today just this palette and yeah I'm not
make it I'm just wearing a dress that I
probably shouldn't have worn for this
video because during the entire video I
look naked but if I go like this I look
stupid so yes I hope you like this one
and if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching
so I've already primed my lids and I'm
just going to jump into the palette the
first shot I'm going to take is this
color right here and I'm going to start
focusing this in my crease now this
tutorial is
rimas just two steps in the crease but
it's just a lot of blending back and
forth so I'm taking that Shane and on a
fluffy brush I am just buffing this into
my crease I'm starting off slow and I'm
just adding the color little by little
then I'm going to go back into the
pallet and I'm going to take this matte
cream color and I'm going to use this to
highlight underneath my brow bone and
I'm going to go back into that previous
shade and continue on with this blending
of the crease now I'm going to go into
this deeper red shade and I'm going to
take an even smaller crease brush and
I'm really going to focus this shade in
the crease the other shadow I kind of
just put everywhere this I'm really
taking my time to be very precise and
I'm only applying this right into my
crease and now I'm just going back and
forth with those two eyeshadows and
those two different brushes and I'm just
continuing to blend those two shadows
together and I'm kind of flicking the
brush outwards to give my eyes more of
that cat shape so just take your time
with a step it's the longest steps just
going back and forth with those two
eyeshadows but you know blending
blending blending okay so I'm going to
take my Tarte shape tape concealer you
can use any concealer or even an
eyeshadow base if you find that your
concealer creases on your lid but I'm
just going to carve out my eye with this
concealer and I'm not going to pass the
crease but I'm going to do like a
perfect little egg and that's going to
create the cut crease it's going to look
like your crease is cut and then I'm
going to swipe my brush across to kind
of create that angle that cat eye look I
mean you see what I'm doing I'm really
like not explaining this well but you
see I kind of dragged it up a little bit
too high here but I mean it's okay it
was my first crease I try my best I went
back into the eyeshadow palette and I'm
using this topi shade and I'm going to
pack that on my entire lid right on top
of the concealer I put down and then I'm
going to use that brush to kind of carve
out the edges and make them a little
straighter because they was looking a
little crooked and then I took that
first shimmery shade on a fluffier brush
and I'm just lightly dusting this on my
eyelid because I wanted the eye to be a
little bit more silver and not so much
taupe so I mixed those two eyeshadows
together and then I cleaned up the
with a white and then I went in with an
eyeliner this is the Kat Von D trooper
liquid liner and I'm just creating a
wing that's not too thin but it's not
too thick either and yeah now I'm going
to move on to my face makeup before I
finish up the eye this is the Beca first
light priming filter it's like their new
purplee primer and I love it it makes my
skin very very dewy and then I went in
with the Loreal Pro glow foundation I
believe this is the shade 2:03
I am buffing that in with this it
cosmetics brush this is the love is for
real brush I think it was limited
edition but I'm pretty sure you can
still get it at Ulta and now for
concealer I'm going to use the Tarte
shape tape concealer this is a new shade
it's called light neutral a little bit
too yellowy for me I'm still trying to
find my perfect shade in this concealer
but I'm just buffing that in with a
brush and then I'm actually going to
take a newer concealer this is the
Milani retouch any race light lifting
concealer and I'm in the shade light and
I'm just going to apply this underneath
my eyes and between my eyebrows my nose
on my chin and I'm going to use this
computer to really brighten up the face
kind of like highlight the face I love
this concealer for brightening and give
you a nice dewy or like satin finish the
skin I don't know I really like it on
top of other computers because it's not
full coverage so I don't love it on its
own and then to set my under eye
concealer I'm going to use my cover FX
loose translucent powder
I'm actually not only setting my
concealer but I'm setting my entire face
okay so to finish up the eyes I'm going
to take this Milani Kohl Kajal eyeliner
I love this eyeliner I don't know I
don't use it more often because it's so
black and so creamy so I'm tight lining
with this and I'm also applying it to my
waterline and then I'm going to take
this J right here and I'm going to start
to buff this on my lower lash line now
I'm going to take this charcoal e grey
brown shade and I'm going to focus this
a little bit closer to my waterline but
still buffing it on my lower lash line
just to give a little bit of depth then
I thought it needed a little bit more
smokiness so I took the black and I
applied this just on the outer corners
just to add a little bit of like a
darkness in the outer corners and then I
just took that shade and blended my
lower lash line some more to highlight
my inner corners I took this really
pretty shimmery shade and just pop that
on my inner corners and then I threw on
some mascara this is the trish mcevoy
mascara and then I went in with some
falsies I'm using the Ardell 1:13
falsies they're so pretty and like wispy
on the outer corners really fun
I love them so to finish up the face I'm
going to take the cover effects bronzer
in the shade at Sun Tan and I'm going to
contour my face with this but I'm also
going to bronze so I know why I bounced
when I contour but I noticed that like I
bounced in my chair anyway this is
contouring my face and then I switched
to a different brush because I wanted
something a little bit like flimsier and
a little fluffier and yeah I'm just
bronzing up the skin some more pretty
much applying this everywhere for blush
I'm going to take the hmmm blush in the
shade cameo pink it's like a really
pretty cool toned pink I love this blush
pop that on my cheek and then to
highlight my face I'm going to take this
Milani strobe light instant glow powder
in the shade after well it is so pretty
it's like a pinky silver highlight but
when the light hits it it is beautiful I
love it
I'm just highlighting my cheeks my nose
I don't want people don't love No
lightin but I do I'm just highlighting
my entire face and then to finish off
the look I'm going in with my lips and
this is the new Urban Decay vice liquid
lipstick in the shade Vampira lips but I
wanted a glossy lip and I wanted
something a little bit more nude so I
took the flower Beauty gloss in the
shade classic nude and I love this lip
combo and then to set everything down
I took my Milani make it last setting
spray I love this setting spray we have
