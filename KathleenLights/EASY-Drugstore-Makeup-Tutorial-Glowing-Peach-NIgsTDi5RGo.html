a tutorial only look I'm wearing right
now it's very fresh and springy and
breezy I love it
a lot of people are not gonna like this
I look but I think it's so I don't know
I think it's really pretty and it gives
like a fresh pop of color and it's so
easy cuz it's one I shadow it's
ridiculously easy and I personally
really like it and I love the dewy skin
to highlight the glow I love it all and
the best part is that it's drugstore
everything I use in this video on my
face is drugstore I hope you guys
enjoyed this video
lend me a comment down below if you like
eat yeah and if you want to see how to
get this fresh springy peachy look then
just keep watching so I want a really
dewy look for today's look I'm gonna
take my L'Oreal magic lumi light
diffusing primer and I'm going to apply
this to my entire face to give that
really pretty luminous glow underneath
my foundation too high some of those
dark circles underneath my eyes I'm
going to take this pixie um corrector in
brightening peach I'm going to apply
this with my finger really really close
to my eyes you see the difference do you
see the difference I see the difference
this really counteracts like the Blues
under your eyes for foundation I am
using the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation instead of the healthy mix
serum it's a different kind of
foundations but I really like it it's
not as dewy as the serum and it has a
little bit more coverage than the serum
I like them both a lot
I like the serum a little bit more but
this one has a little bit more coverage
so I'm applying that with a flat top
kabuki from Sedona lace then for
concealer I'm going to take the best
come see they're at the drugstore which
is the Maybelline fit me I have mine in
15 fair and I'm going to apply this
underneath my eyes to hide my dark
circles a little bit enough mainly to
highlight my face so I'm going to take
that in between my eyebrows on my
Cupid's bow on my chin and all that
stuff to highlight of course then I'm
going to blend it all in at using this
brush from Sedona lace as well I've
really really been loving this brush
it's
the to 1/7 brush I don't know it's
really good to blend out concealer
underneath your eyes because it's fluffy
but small I got the same time kind of
dense too I really really like this
brush
a subscriber actually sent me these
little Miley's brushes and I love them
there I'm going to set my concealer with
this elf blush brush and I'm going to
use the elf HD under eye setting powder
I love this to set my oak I dropped it a
little bit I love this to set my under
eyes because it really minimizes
creasing and it gives like a nice
airbrushed look underneath of the eyes
so I'm going to go ahead and start on my
eyes I'm gonna take the Jesse's girl i
shadow primer this is just going to make
my eyeshadow last a lot longer and just
prime my eyelids for the eyeshadow but
to cover up some of the veins on my
eyelids I'm going to take this Milani
like chubby stick in continuous almond
or almond cream I'm not exactly sure
I'll have it down below and I'm just
gonna blend that onto my lids and this
is just gonna add a really nice space
for the eyeshadows as well I'm going to
go into this LA Colors single eyeshadow
and I'm gonna apply this to my entire
lid using a fluffy brush this is in the
shade Bear mob it's not mauve but you
know that's okay
that's the name of the eyeshadow so I'm
applying that all over my lids and then
I'm gonna go into this six pan wet and
why I can't open it but it's a wet and
wild six pan I've shadows this is pretty
new and this is in the shade California
roll I'm going to take the peachy color
in that palette and I'm going to apply
this to my entire lid and this is pretty
much gonna be the look I just think
having like an all peach eyelid is so
pretty especially for spring I just
really really love this eyeshadow it's
actually pretty pigmented and I like
this um six pan palette there's only a
couple shades that aren't very good but
overall it's really good I'm going to
take a more precise blending brush and
dip it right back into that peach color
and I'm gonna apply this in my crease I
have had to stop this voice over like 10
times because I keep coughing so yeah
I'm just still a little sick but anyway
I'm taking this one dollar elf brush and
I'm going to dip it into that really
pretty champagne sparkly color and this
is going to be my highlight underneath
my brow bone or on my brow bone I should
say I'm gonna apply that same eyeshadow
to my inner corner make them nice and
bright because everything is so Matt I
want my tear ducts to be nice
and shiny and beautiful this eyeshadow
is really pigmented and I love it
I'm gonna go back into that bear mauve
shade from LA Colors and I'm just gonna
run this underneath on my lower lash
line just to give it a little bit of
color there then I'm gonna take my
favorite two brown eyeliner ever and
this is the NYX tres Jolie gel eyeliner
as I'm sure you're sick of me using them
so much but they are my favorites and
I'm only adding a little bit of brown
just to the outer corners of my
waterline curling my lashes and then I'm
going to apply the Maybelline colossal
volume express mascara but you can apply
whatever Wescott I look so bored
applying mascara but apply whatever my
scare you wants and then I'm going to go
ahead and finish my face I am taking the
Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer in the shade
rich bronze and I'm going to start to
warm up my cheeks with this color it's
not too too orange to where you can't
contour so I'm contouring a little bit
this one is actually not so bad it's not
super orange the warm tan one is a
little bit more orange but the rich
bronze rich bronze
yeah that one has a little bit more
Brown to it so I'm just using that to
contour it's really easy to blend out
because the cream and I don't know I
really really love this cream bronzer
it's the best at the drugstore well they
sell Sonia Kashuk at Target but yeah
then I'm going to take is this Milani
tan bronzer type of thing it's a really
pretty shimmery face and body bronzer
and on a bigger stippling brush I'm just
gonna apply this to my cheeks and around
my face to give me that shimmery bronze
II Jennifer Lopez kind of glow because
that's what this bronzer gives cuz it is
a little bit shimmery well a lot of it
shimmery
now I'm going to take this Maybelline
master highlight highlighting blush in
the shade coral and I'm going to apply
this to my cheeks this is a blush but it
has a beautiful Sheen to it that's why
it's a highlighting blush and it gives a
really really pretty highlight to the
face but of course I'm going to take it
to another level I'm going to give it
some more highlighting action this is a
Milani single eye shadow in the shade by
the chiffon and it's like a pale gold
eyeshadow but it is the most beautiful
pale gold highlight for the face ever I
love it so much so I'm just adding some
more highlight to the look of course to
finish off this look I'm going to take
the maybelline creamy matte lipstick and
daringly nude and apply that to my lips
and then I'm going to add some lip gloss
on top this is the LA Colors little
jelly lip gloss it doesn't have a name
on it but it's like the really really
light pink one this lip gloss smells
like bananas it smells so good literally
like bananas I don't know what the name
of it is and I'm so sad that there's no
sticker on it or anything but it's a
really pretty non sticky lip gloss and
that completes this look I really hope

in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
