I'm wearing right now it is like a
bronzy but like a pinky bronzy look um I
always do wings liner all the time
either with gel or with liquid liner I
just I've always done that but I did
something a little bit different in this
tutorial that I haven't done in a while
and I just I love how it turned out and
I hope you guys do too okay so if you
want to see how to get this look then
please keep watching
okay so I've already done my eyebrows
and I ready to decide my brows have not
been cooperating with me lately so don't
look at them okay so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to take my
Urban Decay primer potion this is just a
little baby in the old packaging I've
had this forever lasts pretty long time
I would say and I'm just going to put
this all over my lid all the way up to
the brow bone and then kind of run it on
my lower lashes a little okay so the
first out of the two only eyeshadows I'm
going to be using is called cork it's by
Mac and it's just like a it's just like
a brown it's a really nice crease color
and I'm taking out on this fluffy brush
this is a sigma e40 but any like really
big fluffy brush will be fine and I am
just going to work that into my crease
I'm gonna do it really lightly and just
build up the color I'm going to go back
and forth into this color cork and just
build it up little by little but I'm
also going to be putting some of the
color on the outer V just like rubbing
it in and then bringing it into the
crease okay so now it's my favorite part
it is
the lid color and what I'm going to be
using is Mac's pigment in tan I have
been obsessed with this I use this in
everything and mix it with my bronzer to
give like more glow to my face sometimes
it's actually what's on my accent nail
right here like my nail polish this
color right here is just some of the tan
pigment and then I put a clear top coat
on it so I mean this is such a
multi-purpose little pigment I mean all
the pigments on but I've been loving
loving loving this color it's amazing so
I'm just taking the top I'm like kind of
mixing it and using whatever product is
on the top so I'm just going to take my
Mac 239 brush and I'm just going to pack
this all over my entire lid
but I'm going to take the same brush
flip it like this and kind of bring some
into the crease just a tiny tiny bit
like that like a tiny bit so I'm going
to take my fix+ now and I'm going to
spray my brush a Hawaiian always freaks
me out every time I spray that then I'm
going to dip it into the pigment and put
this all over my lid again the fix+
really intensifies the shadow and gives
it more like a metallic look
and this is really just going on the lid
I'm not bringing it into the crease at
all okay so now I'm going to work on the
lower lash line a little bit and I'm
going to take the same brush kind of dry
it off and I'm going to dip it into the
pigment and I'm only picking up a little
bit on the very tip of the brush like
I'm not putting it on the actual brush
like this it's just on the very tip I'm
picking up a very small amount and I'm
going to run that really close to my
waterline
now I'm just going to go back to my
fluffy brush and back to that cork
eyeshadow that we used in the crease and
I'm going to do the same thing like the
first step I did I'm going to do it all
over again not so much though I'm just
going to try to blend this out a little
more and bring some depth to the outer V
okay I know it seems like a lot of steps
but it's really quickly when you're
doing it on your own it's literally two
eyeshadows
it's just that I'm trying to explain it
but really if you're doing this on your
own it's you're done in a second now I'm
just taking a pencil brush this is a
Sigma e30 and I'm going to dip it right
back Oh dip it right back into this cork
color and we're gonna blend out the tan
pigment on the lower lash line
this part takes a little bit of time you
just have to sit there and kind of blend
so it looks nice and smoked out
okay so once I've done that I am just
going to line my waterline I am using
brown because I don't want it to be
super harsh I don't want it to be like
very black I like this to look a little
chocolaty and bronzy that made any sense
so I'm using the Stila smudge stick
waterproof eyeliner in damsel this comes
in the Stila in the light palette it's
like the most beautiful chocolate brown
color and it stays on your waterline all
day so I'm just going to line my
waterline with this and then I'm in the
tight line as well
okay so now I am going to do this little
smoked out eyeliner so basically I am
just going to be drawing a line right
here like if I were doing a liquid liner
or something but pretty sloppy because
it doesn't matter you're going to be
blending that out in a second
um this dries pretty quickly so I've got
to work quickly I'm just going to take
this this is an eyebrow brush that I got
from Coastal Scents but I use it to like
some on gel eyeliner it's amazing for
that so now I'm just going to smoke this
out
you just want to go back and forth until
it's pretty smoked out and it kind of
blends in with that tan pigment okay so
now that I'm done blending this is what
it looks like it's kind of like a
diffused liner and it's a lot more
natural than having the gave black
liquid liner or a gel liner or something
like that okay so now we're going to
kind of do the same thing on the lower
lash line only I'm not adding any more
eyeliner I'm just going to kind of
smudge what's already there so I'm just
going to start blending this oh I'm
using a pencil brush instead of this one
because this one can be a little harsh
for your under eye so I'm using a pencil
brush I'm getting really close to the
waterline that's how I'm smudging it
down kind of okay so for my brow bone
highlight and like my inner corner
highlight I'm just gonna take like a
cream-colored shadow I don't want
anything shimmery since there's so much
room around the lids you can if you're
doing this look you can go ahead and use
something shimmer if you want to tweet
chisel I just don't like to have
something so shimmery under my brow bone
when I have something shimmery on the
lips okay yeah so I'm just going to take
my white wild enemy palette it's color
right here I don't know what it's called
I know they sell this color separately
wet-and-wild sells it separately and if
you find it i really suggest you get it
it's like the best most pigmented
cream-colored uhm highlight color yeah
so I'm just going to take this on my
pencil brush and put this underneath my
eyebrow
and I'm going to take it into my tear
duct as well
and now I'm just going to add my mascara
I am using my Clinique lash doubling
mascara for my top lashes and I'm using
my legal lengths by Maybelline mascara
on my bottom lashes and I will be right
back okay and this is the finished eye
look I personally love it and now I'm
going to move on to my face okay so for
the face I'm going to keep it pretty
simple I'm not going to do anything
crazy at all
I have already primed my face with the
caffeine relief powder gel and I kind of
touched up some little pimple areas I
put some concealer over them and to do
that I use the yabby concealer I got in
my Ipsy bag last month okay so you guys
are actually gonna witness me using the
Beauty Blender for the very first time
as you can see it's like bright neon
kind of hurts your eyes a little bit
because I have never used it before
umm it's been like - no yeah it's been
like two weeks since I bought it and I
haven't used it yet I don't know why I
guess because I don't want to dirty it
and I was really stupid but um I kind of
just wet it for the first time right now
and like I felt it expand in the palm of
my hand and I thought it was the coolest
thing I don't know that anybody else
experienced that when they first bought
this um it's literally like this big and
okay not this big but it's tiny and then
it just like expands in your hand when
you like um squishing the water out it's
so cool to me oh no I know that's really
dorky but I found that really cool okay
so I'm going to see how well this works
so this is kind of like my first
impressions on it
in this tutorial so I'm going to be
using my L'Oreal True Match Lumi I have
come to the conclusion that this is my
Holy Grail foundation after my Revlon
Colorstay
they're kind of
I want to say this this stuff is amazing
I love it the more I use this the more I
hate my Revlon nearly naked foundation
but anyway so I guess I'm just going to
bounce this into my foundation and put
this on my face
hmm
this is fun for some reason on camera
this kind of looks like it's a little
too dark for me but this I don't know
why looks like that on camera it doesn't
look like that in my mirror that's in
for me this is awesome because um sturdy
um whenever I use like my foundation
brush which my like amazing Holy Grail
foundation brush is the Sigma angled
kabuki D F 84 I love that not even my
Real Techniques expert face brush is as
good as that one and I thought it would
be but it isn't um
but you have to sit there and kind of
blend it for a while this kind of just
puts on your foundation perfectly like
perfectly
and I feel like it doesn't drink up a
lot of the product either like you know
like those little cheap triangle sponges
that you get like at Target and stuff I
used to put my foundation on with that
all the time when I was younger and that
like just drank up the liquid and it's
crazy that this one doesn't because it's
a sponge why I guess the like when you
dampen it kind of doesn't let that
happen but okay so this little guy is
amazing and I don't know if you can tell
but I feel like when I use this sponge
as opposed to my brush gives me more
like a dewy finish this is a foundation
that gives you a dewy finish but I feel
like with my brush when I buff it in I
don't get like the dew eNOS of the
foundation I mean not really not as much
as this I don't know if you can see it
but like my face is glowing over here I
don't know I love this but the real um
test I'm going to put it to the test
right now is how well it blends out my
concealer underneath my eyes cuz that's
what's important to me okay so I pumped
a tiny bit of my mac prolongwear
concealer on the back of my hand and I'm
going to pop this and like a triangle
shape okay oh I'm in the shade and w15
by the way if you're wondering um okay
so let's see
okay so my memory card got full so I had
to go take the memory card out put in
the computer that's how I know that this
video is probably way too long because
my memory card never gets full before I
finish um filming it usually gets fully
when I'm done you know so great um so
yeah while I was uploading the footage
footage yeah I guess you would call it
footage into my computer I set my under
eye concealer with my MSF natural in
mediums my favorite face powder ever but
yeah I think it blended it out amazingly
like just like flawlessly like this
honestly it's flawless
its twenty dollars it's crazy but I
think that it just applies your makeup
amazingly like it doesn't look on my
forehead it doesn't look like I have
foundation on that's insane okay so like
I said earlier I am NOT going to do
anything crazy to my face in my dark
like the Sun comes and goes and that's
what sucks about natural lighting just
like whenever Mother Nature wants to
piss you off it will so I'm gonna take
my ELF contouring blush and bronzer
powder I have been loving this um
recently I like it a lot more for the
summer because I don't know this is a
pretty deep this is a pretty deep
bronzer and it doesn't look good when
I'm like really white I've got in um
gotten a little bit darker I was at the
pool couple days ago
and I've been self-tanning a little bit
so I'm a little darker so yeah I'm going
to be using my Real Techniques blush
brush well I love this brush it's
amazing
kind of comes to like a tip point okay
stop talking Kathleen and get on with it
this is why I do get ready with me
videos this is why I'm going to be
talking here for hours I was a kid in
elementary school got C's in conduct
okay so I'm just going to be dressing it
into the bronzer and tapping it off this
thing is so crazy pigmented now how many
times I've gotten like a spot of bronzer
ridiculous so yeah I am just going to be
bronzing around my face
so just kind of give some like warmth
around my face I don't like bronzer like
all over the face I used to do that a
lot when I was younger just I was so in
denial because my nickname in school was
Casper so makes it like bronze my whole
face and I don't do that I don't like
that but yeah so I'm just going to like
softly contour it looks a little scary
right now but I just blend it out
okay so once I've got that down I'm just
gonna take off any bronze around the tip
of my brush and I'm going to apply the
blush
okay so that's all I'm really doing to
the face nothing too crazy just a little
bit of bronzer a little bit of blush and
that's it for my lips I am using this
NYX butter gloss actually bought this
yesterday and I tried it on and I was
like oh my god I fell in love with it
I'm not a lipgloss person I own I think
like two lip glosses I just I've never
liked them it's amazing amazing it's
amazing oh my god like you ain't get mad
at me there this is in the color creme
brulee I just thought to try it out this
was just like a nice basic color and I
actually loved it so yeah yeah it's
pretty opaque I mean you can build this
up to get like a really opaque lip color
but I just I love it just pretty I love
it
okay so now I'm just going to add my
finishing touch my little magic bad boy
right here a mac fix+
just gonna let that dry and yeah that is
the finished look guys I really hope you
