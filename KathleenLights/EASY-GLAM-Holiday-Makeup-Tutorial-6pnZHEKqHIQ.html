tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's a very very festive fun holiday
look I was actually about to do like a
trial run for Christmas Eve I had a look
in mind I had this look in mind but I
wanted to try it out before the 24th to
see if I liked it or not and it turns
out I really really love how this look
turned out I was honestly completely
winging it right now I was really just
going with the flow and hoping that it
would turn out the way I saw it in my
head and it kind of did actually love
love how this look turned out I think it
is perfect for Christmas Eve or if you
don't celebrate Christmas just for
holiday parties an office party this is
perfect and the best part is that it's
extremely easy to do I wanted to do a
holiday look that was gonna be extremely
easy to recreate and honestly this is
about as easy as it gets no liquid liner
no falsies you know my kind of look and
I know there's been so many tutorials up
on my channel recently it's kind of
strange I never uploaded this many
tutorials like all together I am so
sorry if that's beginning to annoy you
it's just what the holiday is rolling
around I mean there's just so many looks
to do I actually really want to do a New
Year's Eve look as well it's just that
time of year you know actually I'm just
feeling the make up I hope this video
inspires you and I hope if you're
struggling to do your makeup this video
is easy to do and yeah that's pretty
much it if you want to get this fun
green and red makeup look then just keep
watching okay so I always prime my
eyelids with concealer just so they can
cover up all my veins and get it ready
for some eyeshadow so I did that with
the Tarte shape tape and then I just
applied any face powder this is just the
face powder that was in front of me and
I just set down the concealer so it's
not sticky
I'm gonna take my dream Street palette
but I'm only using two shades in the
palette I'm gonna take mooney the
highlight shade I don't know why I
didn't show it but I'm using that to
highlight my brow bone and then I'm
gonna take shooting star and I'm gonna
are applying this really close to my
lashes I'm pretty much applying this on
my entire lid but I'm focusing it mainly
close to my lashes all the shadows that
we're gonna put down I'm focusing them a
little bit closer to the lash line
versus the crease and that's gonna
create kind of like a gradient smokey
effect now I'm gonna take the UH
Nastasia single eyeshadow in the shade
con yak and I'm pretty much doing the
exact same thing only with shooting-star
I pretty much took it up on the entire
lid with cognac I'm focusing it a little
bit closer to my lash line than I did
with the other color but still blending
them together I mean you see what I'm
doing but you know I'm just gonna do
that over and over slowly building up
this color
I'm also dragging the eyeshadow towards
the outer corners of my eyes extending
the shadow a bit just so it looks like
you know my eyes are a little bit more
almond shape instead of round and then I
went in with the mega peak single shadow
in dirty martini and I'm just doing the
exact same thing I'm just focusing this
really really really close to the lashes
I'm not really bringing this color up at
all and then I went in with a more
glittery like intense metallic green
shade this is a single shadow from
Anastacio it's called peacock and I'm
just creating an eyeliner effect with
this eye shadow as you can see
so that there are no harsh lines and
everything is nice and blended into one
another I'm gonna go back into con yak
and I'm just gonna blend the green and
the con yak color together a little bit
more I really want it to be like a
gradient I want it to fade and I want it
to look nice and blended so there's a
lot of blending in this look but it's
super easy and then I went back into
peacock so just intensify the green some
more cleaning up underneath the eyes I'm
gonna move on to my face before I finish
up the eyes you know as huge and to
prime the skin I'm gonna take the new
one in wild
Dulli primer and I'm just going to apply
this to my entire face it gives you a
nice soft luminous glow to the skin for
a foundation this is also a new product
that just recently hauled this is the
Physicians Formula healthy foundation
I'm using two shades L W 2 and L &amp;amp; 4 I
believe I will have them down below but
I don't the color combination was just a
little bit too light for me I wanted it
just a hair deeper so I do eventually go
in and mix in a different foundation but
I just want to show you what it looks
like on my skin just one layer of this
foundation it's very natural perfect for
every day but since this is a holiday
look I did want to add another layer and
just add more coverage so I went in with
the Giorgio Armani power fabric
foundation just even out the color a bit
and to add more coverage as well for
concealer I mean is this a surprise to
you I'm using the usual the Tarte shape
tape concealer I love it I cannot stop
and I'm just playing that underneath the
eyes to get rid of my dark circles to
mask mask those babies and I'm also
gonna be using this concealer to
highlight the rest of my face but like
very softly I just added a little bit to
the center of my face going in with
powder I'm gonna take my RC ma no color
powder and I'm just gonna set down the
concealer
okay so to finish off the eyes I'm going
back into shooting star and I'm gonna
apply this underneath my lower lash line
with a pencil brush all over the place
we're gonna do the same thing we did on
the lid I'm going into cognacs on a
smaller pencil brush a more precise one
and doing the same thing and then
grabbing peacock and doing the same
thing only I'm adding very little of the
peacock shade because I don't want my
lower lashline to look too green and too
grungy so I just applied a little bit of
the green shade and then I went back
into con yak to blend everything out to
highlight my inner corners I'm gonna
take mooney of coats from my dream
Street palette pop that on the inner
corners and then for mascara I'm going
in with the what is this what is oh the
Thrive cosmetics liquid lash extensions
mascara and it is amazing and that
completes the eyes so easy back to the
face I'm going to bronze the skin with
my Physicians Formula butter bronzer
this one is the shade bronzer
I am mainly using this color and this
shade to like sculpt out the face and to
contour but then I'm gonna go in with a
different butter bronzer this is
brand-new from Physicians Formula this
one is the Sunkist butter bronzer and
I'm just applying that to add a little
bit of warmth to the skin for blush are
you surprised
this is the Burt's Bees toasted cinnamon
blush I'm obsessed with this I can't get
enough of it I cannot stop using it it's
like my go-to and I'm just popping that
on the cheeks and for Haley I'm taking
the Charlotte Tilbury bar of gold
highlight I wanted a strong golden
highlight that wasn't too dark for me so
this is perfect and then of course the
star of the show I think this is the
Oprah cosmetics Havana nights liquid
lipstick I love this liquid lipstick
obviously of coats and I think this is
the perfect holiday red that's a little
bit deeper than your typical red it's so
pretty
and it really does just complete the
look this is like the perfect finishing
touch but anyway guys that completes
this video I really hope you enjoyed
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
I'm warded and my grace is cause I was
hoping that I would seem like just
another desperate human that
