a lip swatch video and a review video of
first impressions on em cosmetics if you
guys don't know em Cosmetics is a makeup
line created by Michelle Phan it came
out a few years ago and I tried a couple
of the products and I personally didn't
like them to me it just didn't really
scream Michelle Phan I don't know it
just wasn't my cup of tea and I think
Michelle Phan sold the company something
like that and she recently just bought
it back and then launched and cosmetics
all over again and just when looking at
the packaging and looking at what she
has released so far to me this is more
Michelle Phan like her rebranding like
these products of packaging the logo
like to me this is Michelle Phan and I'm
so excited that she's releasing this
brand and I cannot wait to try out the
products I just want to be clear that
these products were sent to me but of
course that will never change my opinion
I will tell you something's good or bad
no matter what and so far she's only
released two products well 3 technically
if you count these as two different
products even though they're both
eyeliners she has released the
illustrative eyeliner in a felt-tip and
a brush tip version so I'm going to try
the felt tip on one eye and the brush
tip on the other eye just so we could
test these products out see if they're
good see which one I like Milan brush or
felt and she also came out with the
infinite lip clouds these are long
wearing lip creams are essentially
liquid lipsticks that are more hydrating
and more comfortable to wear so we will
try out all the colors I'm going to do a
lip swatches like I normally do and then
I will give you my thoughts on the
actual product and formula after the lip
swatches but first we are going to dive
into the eyeliners which is why I have
no mascara on so let me zoom you in okay
so this is what the packaging looks like
I also love this logo I think it's so
pretty I love simple packaging like this
I love that it's black and white with
the gold lettering and this is what it
looks like I haven't even opened the
Tigers before so first time I see the
eyeliner and I think it is so stunning
well the packaging at least it looks so
sleek and pretty I love it and this is
the brush tip applicator and I'm going
to try the brush tip on my left eye I'm
a little nervous to do this video
because I suck at winged eyeliner
honestly please don't judge me I'm
assuming this is a black color and then
say a shade name I have my mirror right
in front of me and
and let's go first of all I just did one
little stroke but that is very much very
matte and very black just like right off
of that at least is what it looks like
it has a little shaker inside you can
shake it up and get more pigmentation
I'm sure I didn't have to read it like
it wasn't drying out I just wanted to
see that shakiness thing messed up that
little line right there but I'm gonna
fix that really quick I'm hoping I can
match the other eye to that but oh my
gosh I think I really really like this
so far so good it went on really black
really pigmented and I mean there is a
little bit of like a little bit of a
sheen there but barely it's mostly matte
I would say and that was really easy to
use I'm not the best with wing liner I
struggle a lot but I found this to be
user friendly it didn't really skip on
my eye like some eyeliners do it didn't
feel drying or anything obviously it's
the first time I use it the more I use
it the more we shall see but so far so
good based on first impressions I give
this an a-plus-plus I actually really
really really like this okay so now
we're going to take the felt tip
illustrative eyeliner and we're going to
use it on this and I'm assuming it has
the exact same packaging paint shaker
thing only this one has a felt tip and
by the looks of it they almost have the
exact same tip size wise like I don't
think one is more precise than the other
maybe the brush tip is a little bit more
precise and a little bit more pointy but
I don't see a huge difference this is
the eye I struggle with so I'm
struggling a little bit with this but I
do find this one just a little bit
harder to use because it is a felt tip
and brush tips are just flimsier so it's
just easier to just like swipe it on
your eye and my
Ian's brush tips are easier to use cuz
it's some people prefer felt tips and
it's not bad though it's so good ok so
this eye looks nothing like this I like
absolutely nothing so I'm going to grab
the brush tip and I'm going to try I'm
gonna try to even these out and then I'm
gonna put on some mascara and I'll be
back to tell you my thoughts on the
eyeliners ok so to put a simple I really
really like these eyeliners I was
reading that these are supposed to be
waterproof and smudge-proof and they're
supposed to last all days so in the
description box I'm going to leave you a
little note to let you know if it did
last all day and how it wore because the
first time I try this I will leave it in
the description below for you guys I
will give you a good full detail and I
was also reading that the brush tip is
supposed to be for really fine brush
strokes a really precise application and
I find that to be the case you get
really precise with the brush tip I
really love it in my personal opinion I
think this one is better I just prefer a
brush tip like I said it's more precise
and the felt tip is supposed to be for
bolder more intense winged liner looks
which totally because I don't think it's
as precise but it's so really good
they're both really black and really
pigmented like I said earlier now I'm
just repeating myself I love these so
far I give these a big thumbs up we
shall see how they wear but so far so
good I think I'm gonna love them
ok so now we can get into the infinite
lip clouds I'm really really excited for
these I love the packaging on this I
just love the new packaging it's so nice
this is what the actual packaging looks
like when you shouldn't use come on to
me I love it I think that's a little
beautiful I love how this is a matte
black I love the gold top with the logo
on it that looks so cute and I seriously
love this packaging I feel like if I had
a makeup brand like makeup this is the
kind of packaging I would do it's so
sleek and so pretty a little bit and
this is what it looks like it comes with
one of those doe foot applicator that
kind of has like the dip which actually
really like because I find that it hugs
your lips really nicely and oh what is
this noise is that like a mint chocolate
chip I think that's a mint chocolate
chip because it's a little minty
a little chocolatey at the same time I
like it so this is supposed to be a
velvety err whipped cream that glides on
and saturates your lips with full color
it also says that it applies as a
vibrant liquid lipstick but then it
wears too like a beautiful stain so I'm
assuming that as it fades throughout the
day it kind of creates like a stain and
it doesn't crack off or crumble like
normal really drying liquid lipsticks so
I'm going to go ahead and start the lip
swatches and then I will give you my
thoughts at the very end
okay so those are the swatches of the
eight new infinite lip cloud I did pop
this one back on this is in the shade
Rose nude it's my favorite one I love
this one so much okay so I have my
opinion on it so far it is just the
first impression but when I was done
doing the lip swatches I did put this
one back on and then I went downstairs
for a while so this has been on for like
20 minutes and I feel like the longer
it's on your lips the more it does dry
down or the more matte it looks it
doesn't feel drier but it looks more
matte it doesn't even look drying or
anything it just gets a little more
matte like I said ten times these are
pretty freakin amazing I'm not going to
lie there are a couple shades I don't
like this one in Spanish earth and this
one in ultramarine violet these aren't
my favorite just because they were a
little bit patchy going on but it's not
something you cannot work with the
formula is so good that I feel like you
can do a few coats and it'll be okay
especially if you use it a lip liner
underneath like if you put on a
chocolate lip liner and then put this on
top it would be awesome because you get
a moisturizing Brown lipstick but then
you have the lip liner underneath to
make it really opaque and not so patchy
so that's a little tip for you if you do
pick these up a lip liner underneath on
your entire lips will help that for some
reason they swatch patchy err then they
come off on the lips like every time I
want to swatch one I was like oh that
one looks a little patchy but while I
was putting it on my lips they go on so
pigmented especially the lighter colors
they're so like create their like moosie
but not really moosie not so moosie that
you have to do a bunch of layers
sometimes the NYX soft matte lip creams
I love them but sometimes they're a
little bit too mu see that I feel like
they kind of slip or they just don't go
on as nicely these going so nicely I
feel like it's a mousse and a cream
hybrid they literally feel like like lip
clouds that is the perfect name Michelle
you are you are good I have a feeling
these four shades are going to be my go
twos
I really like this formula I hope she
comes out with lighter nudes because
even the lightest nude French nude that
one was fill for me like a deeper nude I
want to see like lighter nose I think
that would be awesome with this formula
I would love to see more news but yeah
definitely check down in the description
below I will let you know how
this where's throughout the rest of the
day I will update you down below about
the eye liner and the lip clouds but so
far based on the lip swatches I think
this formula is awesome they just glide
on like butter the only thing I did
notice is you do have to dip back into
the tube maybe like one more time to get
your entire lips you don't get your full
mouth just on like the first application
which I'm totally fine with because they
are so freakin comfortable so yeah these
were my sauce on and cosmetics I'm so
excited to see where this brand goes I
love Michelle Phan I've been watching
her videos since the very beginning you
guys know I was like a huge YouTube
watcher back in the day and I love her
she's so kind and I'm so glad she
relaunched this brand because I see I
see
good things coming to this brand in the
future like I think she knows what she's
doing and I really like everything so
far I'm not disappointed in anything so
yeah those are my thumbs I hope you guys
