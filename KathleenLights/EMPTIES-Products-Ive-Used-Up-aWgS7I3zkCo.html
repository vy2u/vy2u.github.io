an empties video I haven't done a video
like this in a long time I want to say
and if you have no idea what these kinds
of videos are about basically I just
collect my trash I have been putting
products I've used up in this bag for
months and I think it's finally full
enough to where we can talk about it and
give you my mini reviews whether I would
repurchase them or not and I think that
these reviews are especially helpful
because the person completely used the
product so obviously they have a good
idea whether they like it or not funny
thing is though when I was looking in
this bag like right now when I sat down
to film I was like oh my gosh I've gone
through way more products than this like
where is everything I've gone through
like I know for a fact their hair
products I've gone through that are not
in here and I'm pretty sure just through
the Moy
or maybe Danny through the Moy I guess
he'll see an empty bottle he's like I
guess this is garbage and he'll throw it
away before I get a chance to put it in
this bag because I know I've gone
through way more than just this this is
these are basically products has just
made it to this bag I'm gonna get
started because I don't want this video
to be a million years but you and I we
know it's gonna be so I quickly want to
go through all of these things I am a
makeup remover fanatic like makeup
remover wipe fanatic I love using these
when I travel when I'm doing swatches
when I have too much makeup to remove
I'll start with one of these and then
you know I love makeup wipes the Josie
Maran Barenaked wipes I've gone through
a couple of these and I don't know why I
continue to repurchase them when I don't
love them I love the scent and I just
love how they feel but they don't take
off makeup as well as I would like them
to I mean that's what they're there for
honestly it's for sensitive skin
fragrance free you know they're very
gentle wipes but oh no I mean they're
alright
I don't I don't love them but they're
not bad morphe came out with some makeup
removing tissues and I have collagen and
aloe vera here I'm currently using the
cucumber one and I think the cucumber
one is my favorite because I just love
the scent because I do not like the
collagen ones at all I don't like the
scent
and the scent kind of throws me off so
it's not my favorite but I really do
like the aloe vera ones they're good at
removing makeup removing swatches all
that yeah they're not bad I really
really like the morphing was just not
the collagen I have the simple cleansing
facial wipes these are the ones I used
to use before I discovered these these
blow these out of the water by a long
shot they're both from the brand simple
this is just like the original ones and
these are the micellar makeup removing
wipes these are more gentle than these
yet they remove makeup better I don't
know it's freaking wizardry out of all
of the makeup remover wipes at the
drugstore this one is by far my favorite
out of all of them I've tried like I
love these so love them I used to love
the green but the white I'm point these
are the karez Greek yogurt facial wipes
these were okay these were not the best
I definitely prefer other wipes I don't
know I mean they took off my makeup but
not like so amazingly well you know they
were alright
I haven't said if I'd repurchase or not
but you get the gist these I probably
wouldn't repurchase next up are the
Tarte fresh eyes maracuja waterproof eye
remover wipes I don't like these at all
to remove eye makeup which is what they
are for finally used to be just a little
bit too greasy if I'm going to be honest
like the oiliness kind of gets in my
eyes and it freaks me out not a huge fan
but to remove face makeup really good to
remove swatches or like stuff like that
really good my next two wipes are my
favorite wipes at Sephora these simple
mice other ones are the best at the
drugstore and these two are my favorite
more pricy wipes these are the Murad
clarifying wipes for blemish prone skin
really surprised that I like this
because I feel like anybody with dry
skin hates this but my skin loves this
it says it's clinically proven to keep
skin clear by removing dirt bacteria and
poor clogging oil reduces shine balances
and tightens pores I feel like it does
all of that but it doesn't dry out my
skin I know it I know a lot of people
say it dries out their skin my sister
hates these wife's but I just love how
cooling it
I would avoid the eye area because it
can sting a little bit because I think
this has salicylic acid in it or okay
it has witch hazel in it and a bunch of
other stuff but makes my skin feel so
cool and clean I feel like this removes
dirt so well for my skin I I freaking
love these I go through these like water
literally gone through like a million of
these and then these are pretty pricey
but I have yet to find wipes I love as
much as these these are the koujun doe
cleansing spa waters and i buy these at
sephora i get these little ones these
are the travel ones but i have a big one
right here where it just comes with more
and I still have this like halfway full
I love how you can just like pop it open
I hate wipes they have like a little
sticker on them because they never close
correctly and they dry out your wipes
you know what I mean but anyway I love
the cleanse bars these are just the best
because they remove all of my makeup but
they don't have a nasty scent they don't
irritate my eyes they don't sting but
they are so saturated with water I love
them and it's not like a greasy feeling
you know how some of the Neutrogena
wipes they're really really saturated
like they're very wet but in like an
oily weird way or like a like a soapy
weird way no this just honestly feels
like water Emilia was even like oh my
god what what wipes are these they're
amazing I was like yeah they're amazing
so yeah now that we've gone through all
those wipes so sorry of that part was
boring let's keep it moving
speaking of makeup remover I have gone
through bottles and bottles and bottles
and bottles of Bioderma currently on
this one right now Bioderma is my
favorite micellar water I have tried a
hundred micellar waters and nothing
compares to Bioderma in my opinion
amazing I get these on the Beauty lish
website I finished up this bad boy this
is from the brand soap &amp;amp; Glory I love
this brand they make amazing body
butters and body washes and all that
good stuff
this is their rich and famous dual use
shower and bath body wash this smells
amazing this is the body wash I keep in
my guest bathroom but I mean I use it
all the time it smells so yummy like I
can't think of anything else but to say
yet irresistible almond oats and brown
sugar scent but don't let that scare you
it's not a
sweet scent it's just like a yummy
delicious scent I would definitely go
out and buy this although right now I
don't need to because I have a brand new
one sitting in my guest bathroom right
now it's not my holy grail body wash
like my holy grail body wash is one from
L'Occitane but this stuff is really
really really good I highly recommend
this ok let's jump over to make up
really quick and then we'll go back to
like skin and body stuff I have used up
two of the Kiko extra sculpt volume
mascaras this is my holy grail mascara i
buy it on the Kiko website I have
backups on backups on backups it's the
best mascara I've ever used the only
thing I will say about this is that it
does kind of dry out faster than some
other mascaras I own after about two to
three months it gets clumpy err faster
than other ones that I have but I look
past that because it is so amazing it
makes my lashes look incredible more
mascaras why not I've gone through way
more mascaras in just these but the
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
used to be a favorite of mine like I
used it all the time but I've just
discovered that I like other ones better
than this but it's still a really great
mascara for length super good it
cosmetics super hero of mascara this
dried out even faster than my Kegel one
it was so strange but while it was good
it was good this gives you insane volume
it's kind of clumpy but I don't mind
that it gives you insane insane lashes
and then the benefit roller lash mascara
my favorite tie-in mascara ever just
curls my lashes really well it keeps the
curl it lengthens and volumizes it
literally does everything I want it to
and it's perfect for top and bottom
lashes because of the wand but I do like
the Kiko one a little bit more I went
through the Maybelline fit me concealer
in the shade 10 light this is a great
concealer I used this color actually as
a foundation believe it or not on days
where I don't want to wear makeup I just
kind of dot this all over my face and
just blend it in with a brush pretty
good coverage not full but a nice dewy
finish I love it and then of course I
went through a NARS radiant creamy
concealer it looks like it's full but I
mean it's completely empty like this is
empty this is my favorite concealer
until I was injured
you start shape tape concealer I like
the Tarte one a little bit more but
still a great concealer I used to travel
with this everywhere I went so creamy so
delicious and it looks flawless on the
skin I know a lot of people don't like
it but I really really like it I went
through this crap this sucks so bad I
would never ever buy this again this is
the Saint Tropez gradual tan in showers
tanning lotion this is the original they
came out with they actually released
pretty recently and new one for like
medium to deep skin tones and I bought
it just to try it out I don't know why
because I hated this so much and the
concept was stupid but I wanted to try
it anyway and what do you know the other
one is still stupid I just find the
process of this awkward you have to
literally put this on your body turn the
shower off and stay there cold standing
for 3 minutes and then rinse it off and
it's just I don't like the experience
and it really did nothing I didn't
notice any tan not a fan would not
repurchase 10 out of 10 or no recommend
I've gone through about 28,000 of the
Beauty Blender solid cleansers this is
just the one and only one that made it
to the bag this is my holy grail brush
cleaner I use this to clean my brushes I
use this to clean my Beauty Blender it's
like a white bar of soap but it's really
gentle it doesn't have a strong scent so
it doesn't linger on my brushes but it
literally cleans everything it's amazing
and I know it's pretty pricey and I know
that there are other dupes on the market
but I did I love the solid cleanser a
Beauty Blender and yes I would
repurchase and I have there's actually
like four of them sitting in my bathroom
right now
this is the drunk elephant TLC Fram
boosts glycolic night serum this is
their old packaging they actually have
completely new packaging and show you
what it looks like maybe you don't care
about anyway why not this is their old
packaging and this is their new
packaging like this used to come off
like this this just kind of twists and
you have the pump right there which I
totally prefer their new packaging but
anyway you guys know I freaking love
this serum it has helped my texture
immensely like on my skin it's a very
pricy product and the first time I
bought this it was like a stab to the
heart because it's a suspense all right
duh suspense but it's so good and it's
so worth the money in my opinion it
makes a difference
my skin and that's really that's really
all I ask for in a skin care product so
totally totally love this I mean I raved
about it in numerous videos I went
through a few brow products two of the
it cosmetics brow power Universal brow
pencils these are really good they're
just a little bit stiff like they kind
of pull at my hairs which I don't love
but I do like the shade I don't think
that everyone is this color it's a
universal shade but I don't think it
works for everyone
but it didn't work for me and I do like
it I definitely think that there are
other brow pencils I like more but that
one's not bad and then I went through a
Anastasia brow Wiz and an Anastasia brow
definer these are completely different
this one has like that angled slant tip
and this one is a tiny little pencil I
love them both and I used to prefer the
brow definer but I just find it breaks
off so easily like this one I didn't
even finish it before it like totally
broke off and fell and I lost it I don't
know I don't really have that problem
with the brow iza's but with the brows
of finders I've been having that issue
does anybody else have the issue let me
know below what can I do it
I don't know but great great Anastacio
can do no wrong when it comes to brows
she knows her stuff I also went through
the bomb's brow Pao it is their eyebrow
powder in the shade light brown I
literally went through this sucker I've
had this since I first started my
channel and this was a while back like I
remember using this off-camera all the
time like I would always just set my
brows with this and I just loved the
color and whenever I feel like adding
powder to my brows this is always the
powder I go for I love it it's basically
just like a brown eyeshadow really but I
like this is the coupe re coconut oil
sugar scrub I mentioned this in a
favorites video a few months ago I love
this I will definitely be buying this
again I had purchased something off the
COPE re website and then they threw this
in as like a free sample a huge free
sample and I ended up loving it it's a
coconut oil scrub that leaves your skin
a little bit oily but not in a greasy
feeling kind of like an a moisturize
delicious ready for tanner kind of
feeling I used to love using this right
before I would apply my self tanner and
I would totally repurchase again I will
repurchase this again but I have soul
any body scrubs right now that I
definitely should go through the ones I
currently own before I jump in and buy
something else but in the future I
totally totally would buy this I went
through this foundation right here this
is the makeup rubber face and body
foundation in the shade number 20 this
is my favorite foundation of all time
literally the best foundation I have
ever used I have another one because I
have backups of this shade because it's
my favorite foundation they just
recently launched the Make Up For Ever
water blend foundation that looks like
this that will be replacing the face and
body this is getting discontinued and I
know a lot of people have been saying
that they actually like the newer
formula more I've heard from almost
everyone that they actually prefer the
water blend over the face and body I'm
someone who does and I'm someone who
actually prefers the older formula I do
like the water blend I still think it's
a good foundation I just I like the face
and body more I have gone through so
many tubs of the origins high potency
night amends I think this actually was
in my last empties video as well this is
my favorite nighttime moisturizer it
makes my skin look so plump and
beautiful the next morning this is the
kind of moisturizer that I see results
like overnight I put it on at nighttime
and in the morning my skin just looks
better and I don't know what it is but
it looks better so I actually haven't
repurchase as I ran out of it I haven't
purchased another one I have to go to
Sephora and get another one of these the
Too Faced hangover RX or hangover X
replenishing face primer is one of my
favorite primers of all time because it
kind of feels like a moisturizer and for
my dry skin this is beautiful I love how
this wears under makeup I love the scent
of it it just feels like a refreshing
moisturizer that sinks right into the
skin seriously love this if you have dry
skin
check out this primer and then my last
product I didn't use it up all the way
but it's going in the trash it's going
in my empties I can't use it anymore
this is the it cosmetics bye bye pores
pressed powder this is my favorite
pressed powder of all times you can see
I hit major pan on this but there's
still a lot of powder left but nothing
is coming off on my skin anymore there's
like a film over the powder
and it's it's not working the same on my
skin it doesn't cover up my pores like
it used to it's not depositing product
correctly and I've done everything I've
scraped it I tried to get that layer of
film off of it to like get down to the
powder but even when I did that it's it
mm I had it back up so I just opened up
my back up and now I'm using my back up
I'm using a brand new one and it's like
I could I could totally see the
difference when I use the new one on my
face this one has just like come to its
last days which sucks because there's so
much product left in this so yeah that
completes this video these were products
I've used up I hope this video wasn't
too boring I will say really quickly
