a hoe and not just any haul it's a for
Vig home so a lot of you already know
but if you don't know from November 6 to
the 9th was the vib rouge sale at
sephora where you get 20% off and for
regular VI bees it's the 13 through the
16th maybe I'm not exactly sure but I'm
a vib Rouge member so I was able to get
the 20% off last weekend and I get
excited for this every year because
Sephora never does sales those brands at
Sephora like never go on sale so when
they give me 20% off like full advantage
of it I knew this was coming I had money
set aside literally for this sale
specifically because it is my time to
really just like go wild and get things
that I've always wanted to buy that
maybe I wouldn't normally buy if it
wasn't on sale I got a couple of little
splurge items and I'm gonna save those
to the end of the video for right now
let's go ahead and get started because
this video is gonna be long girl or
bullet very long I got this really
adorable makeup bag it's from that
breakups to makeups brand they have a
bunch of bags already at Sephora but I
never really liked what any of them said
until I saw this one all dressed up and
ready to glow I love it I can't wait to
use it it's such a sturdy beautiful
beautiful beautiful make a bag so I'm
wanting to get a brush specifically for
cream bronzer for a while I used a
couple brushes that I already have but I
wanted one that I was going to dedicate
to cream bronzer alone and I thought
that this brush would be perfect it's
from their Sephora Pro range Porter and
their brushes ain't cheap so I decided
to pick this up this is their flawless
bronzer number 46 brush and it's short
and perfect and and I love it because it
isn't as dense as I thought it was going
to be which
really excited about because brushes are
a little bit too dense are kind of
harder to blend out my bronzer I like
something a little bit more movable so I
got this and I'm really excited to use
it I love that it's short and fat and
delicious so let's talk about our shadow
palettes I bought two eyeshadow palettes
I got this one from Tarte and the
packaging is so cute on this but this is
their energy noir palette this is what
it looks like it's absolutely beautiful
look at that and the main reason I
bought this well there were two reasons
why I decided to buy this number one as
well this is what it looks like on the
inside
I hate these little things but this one
it looks like on the inside and number
one I bought it because this is the most
beautiful blush ever the second I saw
this blush I was like I need that I want
it the Amazonian clay blushes from Tarte
are like the best blushes ever so I knew
that I would love the formula regardless
and the other reason is because it is a
straight-up cool toned eyeshadow palette
there is not a single warm I shadow in
this palette you get nine eyeshadows and
they're all cool toned greyish purple
taupe shades this is the palette I'm
wearing on my eyes today I'm not wearing
any other eyeshadow besides the ones in
this palette and I think it looks so
pretty and I'm not someone who really
loves school tone eye shadows so I
wanted to get that palette for that
reason just to step out of my comfort
zone a little bit I also have this blush
on that's the blush I'm wearing and then
this eye shadow right here is the
highlight on my face and it is an
amazing highlighting product I love it I
love this palette and then the other
palette I bought is like a completely
different palette and it is this guy
right here this ginormous thing this is
the Kat Von D me vida loca palette it's
huge I haven't even opened it I did go
and buy some of the stuff in store and
then I actually bought the other half of
this haul online and at first I didn't
want to buy this for the same reason
that a lot of people don't like it it is
huge and it's not very practical it's
like a giant thing but the more I saw
people use it the more I was like
I need that and honestly okay this is
what it looks like with this beauty and
to be completely honest it's not like I
was planning on traveling with this
palette anyway because it's so freakin
colorful and I think it's like art it's
a very artistic palette I think the
packaging is beautiful it's big but it's
bold and I really I've come to really
love the style of this it looks like a
record or like a paint you know like an
artist thing like so yeah I'm really
excited to use this palette it's mainly
matte but they did throw a few shimmer
eyeshadows in there which i think is
nice and then you have this little roll
right here of like natural neutral
shadows that you can pair with any of
these colorful ones
speaking of Kat Von D I also got this
little thing right here this is the Kat
Von D Lolita lip duo
it has Lolita and then Lolita too and
this is what they look like this is
Lolita I actually have Lolita and this
is the shade of Lolita that I have I'm
pretty sure this was like the second
formulation this isn't the original
Lolita and neither is this one but I
think that Kat Von D is actually going
to release the original Lolita and name
it oh gee Lolita so we have og Lolita
that's coming out soon Lolita and then
Lolita too confusing I know but - really
really pretty colors I love these kinds
of colors okay so I was really really
excited when I saw this product online I
had the bareMinerals
original foundation a couple of years
ago and I used it all the time I was
really into that mineral makeup a couple
years ago but I ended up throwing away
that product because it was really old
so I was on the website and I was like
you know what I want to get into that
powder foundation again so I went to go
buy it and then I stopped this is the
bare minerals original foundation in a
jumble form I didn't even know this
existed until I went searching for it
so look at this first of all look at
this like display this packaging this
art and then look at the size of this
this is the bare minerals foundation
looks nothing like it I have mine in the
shade a medium beige it's the color I
used to have as well and I don't know if
this is just like a holiday release I'm
pretty sure this is just the release for
the holidays but if you're into the
bareMinerals foundation I suggest you go
on the Sephora website and pick this up
because it is hue pangas I paid $42 for
this which is pricier than the regular
but of course you get a lot more product
than this one and the box says it's a
$63 value which means you save money
actually buying this jumbo size and my
favorite part
besides the packaging because the
packaging is unreal I mean it is plastic
but it's so fancy like so fancy look at
this little gem it's beautiful I love it
but besides that it is big enough to
where your entire brush fits in the cap
that is the problem I had with the with
the regular Rimmer nose foundation my
huge powder brush didn't fit in the cap
because it's a smaller product this is a
big cap so my brush fits in it perfectly
this is from a brand called ciate and
I'm pretty sure that this is a new brand
to Sephora I know this brand has been
around for a while but I'm pretty sure
Sephora just recently started carrying
it I don't know and I got this because I
saw a girl use it on Instagram and
looked so black that I had to get it
this is the CIA chisel eyeliner High
Definition tip eyeliner it says it has a
unique chisel tip for controlled
application and the tip completely threw
me off when I first opened this last
night you can't exactly tell obviously
because you're so far away but the tip
of this brush it's a felt tip but it's
not your regular like pointy felt tip
liner the tip the best way I can
describe this is it looks exactly like
the Real Techniques complexion
perfection sponge where it's like round
on one side of an angled flat on the
other that's exactly what this looks
like it's crazy so I'm really excited to
see how this makes it like a more
controlled application like how this
helps application because the tip is
kind of throwing me off a little bit but
it also really really excites me about a
skincare item and recently Sephora has
brought like a bunch of Korean skincare
into sephora which is amazing
because Koreans know their skincare and
there's a bunch of new brands on the
website that are Korean skincare brands
so I got this because I had never heard
of it it sounded really cool this is the
from a brand called make coupe and it is
their raw sauce I mainly checked it out
online because it said it was a
hydrating and nourishing essence and I
was like this is what it looks like it
has a cute little bottle I got the
smaller size because I didn't know if I
was gonna like it they do sell a much
bigger size the way that you're supposed
to use this is right after you wash your
face and you tone it like when you're
done washing your face and toning all
that stuff you apply this all over your
face and supposedly it's really good it
had pretty good reviews and it's
supposed to have like okay it says it
has high concentration of maple tree sap
to deliver intense hydration and
nourishment adding skin soothing Eco
certified fruit in powder and
nutrient-rich Asian herbal and fruit
extracts creates a secret sauce that
helps to bring out healthy youthful
looking glow within and I'm all about
that glow so I wanted to try this okay
so I went a little crazy with hair care
this is from the brand diva cruel and
I've heard of diva curl but I've never
tried anything from it and it is their
winter curl survival kit featuring diva
curls newest products for maximum
moisture I wanted to buy this because I
want to kind of give my hair a rest from
the iron I'm always flat ironing my hair
my hair is always straight and I have
naturally curly hair so I thought
getting something that was specifically
made for your curls was a good idea so I
could just really like unleash my curly
hair for a while like just keep it curly
for a while so that I can minimize the
heat damage this is the shampoo and
conditioner and supposedly it's really
really good for curly hair it is um
sulfate free paraben free and silicone
free and then this is the coconut curl
styling cream also silicone free and
paraben free and sulfate free I'm so
excited to see how this transforms my
hair so I got this on a whim I just I
threw it in my car I was like why not
this is from the brand verb and I've
never heard of this brand before I think
it's notice' for and it is their
leave-in mist I
wanted a leave-in conditioner that was
like in a spray form because all of mine
are tucked away in a box and I don't
feel like going through my box of hair
care products kind of like it's a ten it
has like a bunch of benefits in it and I
had pretty good reviews so I decided to
give that a try and then the last three
haircare products I got are all from
alterna I have been wanting to try their
caviar range in a really long time and
recently Sephora had a 500-point perk
where you get the caviar shampoo and
conditioner and I got that point perk
and I really liked it so I decided to
dabble into some more caviar alternative
stuff this is the rapid repair spray
instant shine and moisture free of
parabens sulfates synthetic colors from
alterna the caviar line all three of
these things are from that line so I
don't have to say that I know I'm sorry
this thing is amazing my spray is like
totes broken because it sprays out like
a squirt like my thing is broken but so
I have to spray it in my hands first and
then rub it in my hair but this gives
your hair like instant shine I used it
yesterday for the first time and I was
like blown away at how shiny my hair
looks you probably can't tell on camera
probably like I really could not get
enough of this I want to spray it in my
hair everyday just for the scent alone
smells so sexy and like perfume me and
delicious when I freaking love it I love
it then I've been wanting a hair spray
for a long time none of the hair sprays
that I have like really rock my socks
that much so I got the working hair
spray and I really wanted this because
it said ultra dry control there's
nothing I hate more than when you spray
your hair like with hairspray and you
spray like in one spot and it's like wet
it's like a wet crunchy those by mikvah
my hair split why so I decided to give
this a try because supposedly that
doesn't happen with this product and I
had a lot of really good reviews and
then I got this this is their
retexturizing protein cream with strand
building proteins for damage free hair
I have severely damaged here because
I like bleached it twice like a year and
a half ago long story if you've been a
part of my channel for a while you know
what happened but I really really
damaged here so I try to do the best to
get it healthy again and it's not great
to use protein in your hair a lot like
too often because that can make your
hair pretty brittle so I want to use
this like maybe once or twice a week and
supposedly it's really really good it's
a leave-in treatment like after you wash
your hair you put this in your hair and
it's supposed to be really good for
damaged hair so I'm excited okay and
then the rest of these products are like
my splurge item
things that I wouldn't have bought full
price like I wouldn't have bought him if
they weren't on sale I'm not gonna lie
oh except this except this I have been
wearing the same perfume for like the
past nine years it has been my all-time
favorite perfume of life it's called
Gucci - it's from the brand Gucci and
it's their Gucci - perfume and I've been
wearing it for nine years it's my
all-time favorite scent nothing compares
to it it lasts the longest on my skin
it's fantastic it's amazing it's so
unique I love it and for a long time I
could not find it anywhere every store
that I walked into they were like oh no
that's being discontinued and I couldn't
find it and it was breaking my heart so
I kind of like stopped using the bottle
that I had and then so I had to freaking
get it this is my favorite perfume the
only thing I'm worried about is that it
only had the 1.6 fluid ounce online I
couldn't get the biggest bottle like
they didn't even have it for sale online
so that concerns me like is it being
discontinued is the big bottle
discontinued like I'm really really
confused why they didn't have the bigger
size but this is what it looks like and
it is heaven-sent it is the best
fragrance in the world I love it it's my
favorite I will have the notes down
below so you can kind of have a guess of
what this purse person no perfume what
this perfume smells like the notes below
now on to the brands that I never never
buy from because they are ridiculously
priced I got a YSL mascara when do you
ever see me talk about why yourself
never
this is just their like original mascara
it's the mascara volume effect fossils
luxurious mascara I've heard a lot of
really good things about this mascara
the only thing is this is a very light
flimsy like to buy I expected something
very very heavy for the price so a lot
of you guys know that I had bought the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
and I returned it a week after I bought
it it was like sixty two dollars which
is crazy I never spent that much on
foundation but I decided to give it a go
because everybody talked about it and I
didn't like it it made my skin oily that
has never happened to me with a
foundation because I have dry skin but
my skin got really oily at the end of
the day and then it like broke up it
just I was like no no so I returned it
and I decided to splurge on another very
pricey foundation that everybody has
been talking about and this is the Kogan
dough or koujun dough I'm not exactly
sure leave me a comment down below I
don't know how to pronounce this brand
and I want to say it correctly I don't
want to sound dumb so I don't know if
it's cogent dough or Kogan dough and it
is they're aqua foundation everybody
everybody and their dog has been talking
about this I was like oh I gotta try it
out and then I saw the price and I was
like oh no I won't but then the VIP
sales like oh I'm gonna try it because I
get to save 20% off on it so my body
ceases watery looks like I'm in the
shade 2 1 3 this is the foundation I'm
wearing right now I bought it online and
I completely guessed my shade so I'm
very happy that it is actually my shade
and the packaging is really pretty it
has a pump it's a glass it feels you
know luxurious and I don't know I'm not
crazy about it just yet I used it with a
brush a lot of people say that it
applies better with a Beauty Blender so
I'm gonna try it out with a Beauty
Blender I cannot give you my thoughts
just yet because I'm wearing it today
and it's the first time I put it on but
it is a little bit if he's a little bit
heavy I think I might have put a little
bit too much on but it has like a light
to medium coverage and it doesn't feel
like I'm wearing anything but
I have to give it another shot if it
doesn't rock my socks off in about a
week I will be returning picking up
Cogan though I got the alcohol
foundation illuminator this is in the
shade sheer beige it's just like a
liquid highlight but it feels really
creamy and like I don't know I really
like the consistency of this you are
supposed to or at least it's like made
to mix in with your foundation today I
used it as a primer I know it's not a
primer but I used it as a base like I
put this on my entire face and then I
went in with my foundation just sort of
can give me like a nice glow it's a
really pretty champagne color and I
really liked the consistency of this
okay so more things and then we are done
with this haul it's very long I
apologize I got something from Burberry
I never buy from Burberry but I did this
is their light glow natural blush and
out this blush made me laugh when I
opened it for the first time okay so I
bought it online this is in the shade
earthy earthy blush it says so Burberry
is very fancy and it comes with this
little fancy thing right the packaging
is stunning I love it's so luxurious I
really love the packaging but then I
opened their mouths like why do I pay so
much for a blush to then open it and
it's the size of a stick of gum Burberry
I really would have appreciated if the
entire pan like this entire thing was
the blush because then I feel a little
bit better about spending forty dollars
on it and then it comes with this like
brush I mean it's a cute brush and I'm
sure it works perfectly fine but how
often do we use these brushes not often
I have a ton of brushes and I'm not
going to use this to be completely
honest with you guys I don't want to
sound like you know but I'm not going to
use that brush now I just have this like
wiki tool here
for no reason I don't know I'm a little
bit disappointed with the size of the
blush is a very expensive blush and I
don't know if I'm just being cheap but
come on that's little speaking of gorge
your money this is the
maistro' liquid summer SPF 15 I have
mine in the shade 100 I got this based
off of my fan Laura's recommendation
mrs. Lowell in I heard a talk about this
a couple times and I've always wanted a
recent video she was talking about it
and she said that this is like the only
thing that makes her skin look really
tan and like summery that it's literally
like summer in a bottle which it's not
summer right now but you know let me
swatch this because I'm not familiar
with like a liquid bronzer I'm more
familiar with like careens seduces wood
a little sly it is a warm shade but it's
Oh oh wow this is actually a really
pretty color oh my gosh this is so hard
to describe this is what it looks like
blended out and it blends out really
really easily and I don't know how to
describe this right now this is crazy
this has completely dried I didn't blend
it out all the way but this is
completely dried and it feels like
there's nothing on my skin nothing this
is like a 100 percent liquid to powder
formula I cannot believe how this feels
like nothing I'm excited okay guys so
that completes this haul I know it was a
really really long one but with the vib
sale here you know it's just but anyway
I hope you enjoyed this video let me

Rouge member what you picked up in the
