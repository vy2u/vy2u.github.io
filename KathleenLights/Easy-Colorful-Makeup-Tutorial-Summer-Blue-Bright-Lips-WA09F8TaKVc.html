a makeup tutorial on the look I'm
wearing right now it is a really fun
summery look I am a very neutral girl as
you guys know my tutorials are mainly
very simple and easy to recreate and
it's mostly neutral colors but in the
summer I like to play any delete and I
got a request on Twitter the other day I
think a few of you have requested this
but someone said it was a good idea to
do makeup looks inspired by my summer
nail polishes so this is look number one
and I wanted to create this look based
on Porter Miami which is the nail polish
I'm wearing right now and it's pretty
much the exact same color as this liquid
liner but I wanted to do a look that
wasn't just blue I wanted to incorporate
another color in there so this is the
Luke and Akeem oh please I love blue
eyeliner I think this is like the third
look I post on my channel with blue
eyeliner but I love it and I think this
look complements the nails so nicely
like if you wear this look and you wear
this nail polish people be like oh I see
what you did there
so which is it there but even if you
don't wear nail polish or you're not
into this look for the nail polish I
still think this is a fun look for
summer and it's really easy to recreate
the only difficult part is the winged
liner but the rest is easy peasy
and so yes I will be doing more looks
inspired by my summer nail polishes
throughout summer I'm not going to post
them too close together I will spread
them out throughout the summer season
and I hope you guys like this little
series I'm going to do I may want to see
how to get this look then just keep
watching okay semester office looks like
priming my lid and I'm actually going to
use a concealer today I mean I just
often but not really in tutorials but
today I'm priming my eyes with concealer
because I want them to be extremely
covered I don't want to see any of these
veins anywhere and I'm using my
heart-shaped tape concealer as a primer
and for
me this is a really good primer to set
down my eye primer I'm going to take the
shade confection by makeup geek and I'm
going to put this on my entire lid first
just to set that down this doesn't show
up too much on my skin which I really
like because it just gives you a soft
wash of color I'm not going to bring it
over the crease because I will be
highlighting underneath the brow bone
but I am going to take some of this
directly into the crease and really pack
this color in crease just to give a
little bit of dimension to my eyelid
because I actually don't want a lot of
color on my lid I want the blue liner
and my lower lash line to be the main
focus so this is the only color I am
putting down just to contour the eye I'm
going to take this Milani eyeshadow
called Bella ivory I'm going to use this
to highlight underneath my brow bone or
highlight my brow bone I mean okay so
now I'm going to apply my corner Miami
inspired wings this one is a little
crusty looking because I'm going to wait
till I finish this one to perfect the
ends of this one because I know I'm a
mess
when it comes to liquid liner I'm going
to take my NYX vivid bright liquid
eyeliner this is actually a
recommendation by you guys last time I
did a blue winged liner look I asked you
guys for like the perfect cobalt blue
eyeliner and so many of you guys told me
to get this one and this is the shade
vivid sapphire you doing
okay so to prime the skin I'm going in
with a new primer I just recently
purchased it's from the brand touch
insole and it's called the no pore blem
primer and I've really been liking it
for foundation I'm taking the Natasha of
the Nona foundation X full coverage
foundation and I'm just mixing two
shapes together to get my perfect color
I have a little bit more of a tan these
days and I've really really been liking
this foundation a lot and it wears
really nicely on my skin for concealer
I'm using the heart-shaped Cape
concealer nothing new here nothing new
here so what is new is this new powder
I've been using that I have been
obsessed with this is the cat mom D
blotting powder and I have mine in the
shade light I'm going to use this to set
my under eye concealer but this powder
just blurs away my pores I'm obsessed
with it even more than my bye bye pores
from a cosmetics I don't know what's up
with this powder it's like magic but I
just use that to set my under eye
concealer down okay really quickly I'm
going to finish up my eye makeup I'm
just going to add a purple smokey lower
lash line I'm taking the Milani stay-put
waterproof eyeliner in the shade keep on
sapphire and I'm just going to apply
this to my waterline
now I'm going to take the sugar pills I
shadow and velocity I like the name of
that and on this little tiny dose of
colors brush that I got with their new
eyeshadow palette I love this little
brush it's awesome
I'm going to take go to the pencil side
and I am just going to rub this re
pretty much on top of my waterline not
going to lie I'm going to get it as
close to the water line as possible and
this is just going to set down that
eyeliner setting it with this eye shadow
is going to intensify the blue and also
keep that eyeliner employee now I'm
going to take a dark purple eye shadow
this one is grape day it's from morphe
it's one of their single shadows and on
a flat eyeliner brush I am going to put
this really close to my lashes not
directly on top of the blue but really
really close and this is going to create
kind of like an indigo blue like a
really deep purpley blue I'm taking this
makeup forever I'm sorry there's so many
single eyeshadows in this video I
apologize but I'm going to take the
makeup forever single eyeshadow and 192
- or I nine - - I mean and on the other
side of that dose of colors brush I'm
just gonna pop this on my lower lash
line and this is where it gets really
purple
I'm going to take these eye shadow
further down than I normally would
because I want the main focus to be this
like purpley lower lash line so I'm
dragging it down a little further than
usual and then I'm going to take this
lighter purple it has a bit more pink to
it and I am going to apply this even
lower than another purple then I'm just
going to take great day one more time
and do the same thing I did earlier just
in case it got blended away with the
other purple shadows I just want the
base of the lashes to be deeper and have
like that darker purple for my inner
corners I'm going to take nostalgic by
makeup geek and with my pinky I'm just
going to pop the red on the inner
corners and then I'm going to take
phantom bye make a peak also and I'm
going to put that directly on top and
it's going to give it more of a purple
highlighter look now I'm just going to
curl my lashes and then I'm really
really gonna pack on this mascara
normally for a look like this I would
put on falsies you guys know I don't
really wear falsies but for this I
totally would but since the eyeliner is
blue and not black I think you'll be
able to see the mascara pretty well so
I'm going to love these lashes with the
l'oreal lash paradise mascara i have
been loving this it is so good and I'm
going to use blackest black and then of
course I'm going to apply some to my
lower lashes and then that'll be the end
of this eye look and we can complete the
face makeup now I'm just going to bronze
up the skin with this bad boy this is
the pretty vulgar bronze B bronzer and
this is in the shade Sun of the beach
and I'm just using this to contour a
little bit but mainly just to give my
skin some color to run some skin I
really like the undertone on this
bronzer I really like it a lot and then
for blush I'm going in with the hmm
powder blush in the shade cameo pink
it's a really pretty subtle cool toned
pink but I think it pairs really well
with this makeup and this is the first
time I'm actually using this this is the
benefit
de Lyonne twinkle highlight and I
usually love subtle highlights but I
feel like this one is subtle with quite
shimmers in it and I don't know I don't
know if I mostess there's something
about it it doesn't last that long on
the skin either I'm just I'm not a huge
fan but just give a pretty effect okay
so before I go in with my lip color I am
going to set my entire face I just feel
like this highlight was a little bit too
light for my skin tone right now and I
just want all the powder to just like
melt into my skin so I'm going to take
the morphe prep and set makeup setting
spray and I'm going to set that and then
wait for it to dry
try not to move my mascara on my lashes
so if you're recreating this sillas and
you want something a little bit more
wearable you should totally go in with
like a nude lip or like a pinky nude
forever but I'm going to go in with a
colorful lip this is the ofra long
lasting liquid lipstick in the shame
Tropez and I'm going to put face to my
lips alright guys so that completes this
look I wanted to do a colourful look
that incorporated a blue to match Porter
Miami and I hope you really really
enjoyed it I love purple and blue
together especially like pinky purple I
really like it so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching it please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
I had lipstick on my teeth to set down
my eyelid primer to set down my eyes to
set down my FRA to set down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
