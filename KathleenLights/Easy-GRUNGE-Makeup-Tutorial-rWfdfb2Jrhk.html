tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's a little bit similar to my
everyday fall makeup look but other be
more dramatic a little bit more like
goth II I don't I don't like to label
this as goth II but you know what I mean
like I don't know how what other word I
can use to describe it I really love
looks like this during the fall Dani is
a little bit scared by it he's like Oh
your lips are like dark brown and I'm
like yes I know they're staying this
color but what I think I'll fall two
things come to mind like two types of
makeup looks come to mind for me I think
of makeup looks like this like very
grungy very 90s like and berries and
dark dark dark vampy lips and then I
think of like pumpkin spice looks like
very very warm and Amber's and delicious
oranges a bunch of those colors those
are the two types of looks I think of
whenever I think of fall like either
very grungy or very warm and cozy so
this one is a low grungy and I just
really love golden highlights in the
fall for some people
people are like Oh fall is not for
highlighting I'm gonna highlight all
year round I really don't mind if people
don't like it I'll even wear like candy
yum-yum in the fall time I try not to
limit myself to just like seasons where
whatever makeup you want if you want to
do hot pink lips we're hopping lips I'm
going off on a tangent well this is
toriel and if you want to see how to get
this makeup look then keep watching my
eyes are already primed with Mac's
painterly paint-pot and I'm going to
dive into the low rock unzipped palette
I'm going to take this color right here
it's like a dusty rose and on a fluffy
blending brush I'm just going to buff
this into my crease this look is very
sloppy so it's perfect for those of you
who are sloppy with your makeup because
it's a sloppy kind of look I'm taking
this shimmery shade in the palette and I
know that this is a matte eyeshadow look
but I'm applying this to my entire lid
so that the color I put on top is not
like just a flat matte I don't know if
you guys can tell
you can kind of see in my other eye that
it's a matte color but there's it's like
a satin finish and that's the look I was
trying to go for it's just a lot easier
to blend and stuff like that I don't
know it was just something different I
was trying so I'm applying this burgundy
shade all over my entire lid and then
taking a different blending brush and
buffing this into the crease I want this
color to be like very messy and just
blown out from lashes all the way up to
the crease I'm going to be taking this
light pinky champagne shade on a pencil
brush and using that to highlight my
inner corners and then this shade to
highlight underneath my brow bone then
I'm going to go ahead and move on to my
face makeup before I finish my eyes I'm
going to be using this that I got in my
boxycharm it's the provides skin milk
it's just a moisturizer and I'm applying
that to my face before priming my skin
was extra dry that day so I'm using the
Loreal magic lumi light infusing primer
just to give my skin a nice glow and a
nice space for my foundation I'm going
to be mixing these two products it's the
Mac Pro Longwear nourishing foundation
and I'm mixing in my Smashbox Smashbox
well my Smashbox BB water to give it a
more luminous lightweight finish because
the Mac one can get a little bit cakey
on my dry skin but I really like the
combination of the two so I'm just
blending that in with my Real Techniques
buffing brush and then to highlight and
conceal my dark circles I am using the
Maybelline master conceal concealer and
blending that out with the Real
Techniques contour brush like I said
you've seen me do that a million times
but to further highlight my face I'm
going to take that same concealer and
apply it to other parts of my face where
I would normally highlight okay
and then I'm just going to set my under
eye concealer with the Real Techniques
setting brush and the Maybelline fit me
powder in 1/35 all righty then let's
finish off these eyes I'm going to take
this mauve color again on a pencil brush
and just blend that on my lower lash
line really sloppily all over the place
then I'm going to take this dark it's
like the darkest color in the palette
and on a small little brush I'm just
going to add some depth to my lower
lashes I just wanted something a little
bit darker so I'm going to take a pencil
brush and spray some fix+ on it and dip
it back into this eye shadow used
earlier and I'm just gonna intensify my
inner corners even more and then drag it
on my lower lashes as well as you can
see and then I'm just going to apply
some mascara
super easy look like but I think it's
really pretty it's so simple okay so I'm
going to contour my face this is like a
tulip style brush from Sigma and to
contour I'm going to use my L'Oreal True
Match powder in si8 cocoa I believe
that's what it's called
and I'm just gonna lightly contour my
face
and then I'm going to highlight the tops
of my cheekbones using the laura geller
gilded honey highlight this is a Real
Techniques setting brush I use the
earlier it's also a really great
highlighting brush as well and then I'm
just going to add a lot of warmth to my
cheeks Oh I'm also going to highlight my
nose and then I'm going to add a lot of
warmth to my cheeks using this Urban
Decay Naked illuminated like bronzer
kind of product it's pretty new and it's
in the shade lit I believe I will have
it below but I'm pretty sure it's called
lit and I'm just warming up my cheeks
with this product it's very warm and
glowy to finish off my lips I'm taking
colour-pop ultra matte lip in limbo and
I'm filling my entire lips with this and
then I'm gonna go over it with NYX matte
lipstick in the shade Mason I wanted a
cooler Brown look so applying this just
made it a little bit more of a cool tone
color so that completes this look thank
you guys so much for watching I really
hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video ciao</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
