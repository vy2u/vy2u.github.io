tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now this is the exact same look I was
wearing in my September favorites video
and so many of you guys asked me to film
a tutorial on this look so that's what I
did
it is a talk through tutorial because I
haven't done one of those recently and I
am using the masquerade palette by
dubious place I know I've been using it
so much but since this was in my
September favorites I did this look
using it and it was requested so that's
what I'm doing it and then I realized
like every time I wear a look like this
I get so many compliments on how green
my eyes look any time I wear red tone
eyeshadows or very warm eyes shadows I
get complimented on how green my eyes
look so I thought this look would be
perfect for those of you with green eyes
I mean if you have any eye color you
could totally do this look but this is a
great way for those of you with green
eyes to really make your eyes stand out
and it's so so easy this look is perfect
for the holidays even though we're only
in October December we'll be here in the
blink of an eye and this look is perfect
for Thanksgiving for Christmas for
anything so yes anyway if you want to
see how to get this look then just keep
watching
okay so I've already applied my
foundation and my concealer and my
powder just because I feel like I do
that in every single look and I don't
want it to be too repetitive or too
boring but I'm wearing the Urban Decay
all nighter foundation and whatever I'm
wearing will be listed below so I'm
gonna put my hair back I recently
purchased this you guys know I like to
wear these little headbands when I film
tutorials this is the one that I always
wear I have put it away for the spring
and summer and I was wearing like the
flower pink one but I'm ringing this bad
boy back out and I love it I have
purchased this one but this one hurts my
head like I mean I have a big head and
this is like so tight I don't know I
guess a word a few times and maybe my
big ol hit will stretch it out but you
guys don't care I know I'm just I'm just
I don't know I'm chatty today okay so
I'm just gonna go
and get started I am busting out The
Masquerade palette by Julia's place and
all I did in my September favorites
video was just take all the matte shades
and I just threw them on my eyes so on a
fluffy crease brush this is the NARS
crease brush it says number 42 at the
bottom I'm gonna take the shade Burkina
right here and I'm gonna focus this on
my lid I'm not really gonna bring it up
to the crease oh wait let me zoom it
down even though I am using a crease
brush I really don't want it to get too
far up on my lid I'm just using a crease
brush to really blend and buff
everything out focusing it really really
close to my lashes and then dragging it
up and buffing it out
I used my concealer to prime my eyelids
and then I start to slowly drag some of
that into the crease
it's gonna look a little bit messy but
that is the look we're going for it's a
very messy
smoky daytime look I mean you can
totally wear this in the nighttime as
well this is definitely not something
that's just for the daytime
now I'm going to go in with a clean
blending brush this is the morphe 23 and
I'm going to buff out those edges I do
not want too much pigmentation here in
the crease
now I'm going to take the shade Zulu
right here which is a very very warm
almost red brown I'm going to take the
morphe 13 brush I know that these are
discontinued but I know so many of you
guys have them already and I'm pretty
much just applying this color really
really close to the lashes and doing the
same thing just dragging it up a little
bit but I'm not going to take it as far
as I took the shade Burkina
now on an even smaller little fluffy
brush this is the Real Techniques
shading brush I'm going to take this
shade right here called a de or add up
it's very similar to the shade we just
used but this one is a little bit more
red and I'm going to do the exact same
thing focusing this one even closer to
my lash line than the other shade so
we're pretty much doing like a gradient
you want your shades to fade from like
darkest to lightest
then I'm going to go back in with that
fluffy brush we first use and go back
into that first shade we used and I'm
just going to blend on top of it and I
know it's a little bit repetitive but
we're going to do the exact same thing
all over again I'm going to apply the
shade Zulu once more on my lid there is
a little bit of fallout with this
palette as well as you can see there's
kind of like some brown eyeshadow
underneath which is why I always always
do my eyeshadow first sometimes I'll do
my face makeup first like today but I
always recommend doing a shadow first
and then I'm going to go back into the
shade Aida with this same brush and do
the same thing for some reason a lot of
people always tell me like why is your
eye makeup before your face you're not
supposed to do that you're supposed to
do your face makeup first and I don't
get why people get so upset about it
like where is the handbook tell me where
it says that I have to do my face makeup
first please tell me it's just personal
preference doesn't mean you're doing it
right or doing it out of order do your
makeup the way you want to if you want
to draw on one eyebrows and do your
whole face and then draw this one who
says you can I like to put on my eye
makeup first because I like to avoid the
fall out on my foundation okay so I am
gonna go back in with a few more eye
shadows in a second but I want to work
on my lower lash line so I'm going to
use the exact same shades I already use
on my top lid I'm going to take Burkina
first I have no idea if I'm pronouncing
that word correctly doesn't it sound
like I am I'm going to apply it using
this Urban Decay brush number II 208
then I'm going to take the shade Zulu
followed by a little bit of Aida I'm
going to use the Luxy 217 brush to
smudge both of these out dip it into a
dub odda and getting really really
really close with this shade
I love looks like this because they
really take no skill and even though
they look a little crazy and weird now
with eyeliner or a ton of mascara it
just looks like edgy and smoky and it
was like the easiest I look ever now I'm
going to take the color pop creme gel
liner in the shade mr. Bing I love this
eye liner it just intensifies any Brown
smoky eye and I just love how it makes
green eyes look even brown eyes I feel
like mr. Bing emphasizes like the golden
tones in your eyes if you have brown
eyes awesome for blue eyes as well gonna
apply a little of this
so the look in my September favorites
video wasn't as red as it is now I did
apply some more brown colors so I took
the shade Fulani so you say they
probably no Fulani phalanges and on this
same Real Techniques brush I'm going to
apply that really really close I'm also
going to put that on my lower lash line
then I thought okay I want to even a
little bit less red because I really
wanted to match my lip color but I don't
want it to clash so on this little brush
this is the zoeva 237 brush I took this
eyeshadow this is the makeup forever
m61 eight but any dark brown eyeshadow
you have in your collection I know you
have one that will work taking a bit of
this and smudging that super close to
the lashes like super close because this
eyeshadow is intent
now I'm going to take this shade right
here called Giza and on this Milani
crease brush I'm going to put that on my
inner corners for my brow bone highlight
because the masquerade palette doesn't
really have a very very light satin
color I'm going to take my essence pure
nude highlight which I'm going to end up
using on my face and I'm taking the
morphe M to10 brush and I'm gonna use
this to highlight my browbone i'm giving
my eyelashes a really good curl because
I am NOT applying eyeliner or false
lashes so I really want my mascara to
stand out this is the tweezerman eyelash
curlers and now I'm going to apply a lot
of this this is the superhero mascara by
it cosmetics very volumizing very black
I'm gonna apply a ton of this okay
that's the cup pretty that is it can get
a little bit clumpy if you use too much
what I like to do when my eyelashes
start to stick together is I'll take
this I love this is like my little
trusty guy this is the morphe b71
and i'll just comb through my eyelashes
and it really does a good job of getting
rid of those clumps so I'm just gonna
apply mascara to the rest of my lashes
and I will be right back to finish my
face okay so now we are completely done
with the eyes so so so so easy now I'm
going to contour my face a little bit I
know in my favorites video I was wearing
the Kevin Taquan sculpting powder in
light but since I just used that like in
my last tutorial I didn't want to use it
again so I'm gonna take the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer which now I totes
realize I also used this in my last
tutorial this is the butter bronzer in
the shade bronzer I'm gonna take my
Milani blush brush I love saying that
blush brush my blush brush and I'm gonna
use this to contour my face can
Physicians Formula release a butter
bronzer that smells like fall that'd be
awesome because right now this is taking
me to Hawaii are you guys watching how
to get away with murder I'm not gonna
give any spoilers I hope I don't lose
interest in it the way that I lost
interest in scandal I know don't cut me
but I did lose interest in scandal just
because I was like going back and forth
like who does she love her and it just
it was driving me nuts so now I'm going
to take the wet n wild color icon
bronzer in ticket to Brazil it's a very
warm shimmery bronzer and I'm just going
to use this to warm up the skin a little
bit I was also wearing this in my
favorites video using the zoeva 90 brush
it's like their big powder brush tap tap
tap tap tap it up okay so for blush I'm
going to use the bomb's blush in the
shade bomb Beach this is a very long
wearing blush and I've read this this
like lasts a long time on my skin taking
my makeup forever 122 brush it's just a
stippling brush I like stippling brushes
for blush like any stippling brush
because I feel like it applies lush a
little bit more naturally you don't have
to get a makeup for everyone this is
like overpriced elf has a really really
nice stippling brush that I love morphe
Sigma
okay so now I'm going to highlight my
face using the highlight I use
underneath my brow bone the essence pure
nude highlighter this stuff is so
affordable and so good it looks so
natural on the skin just going to apply
some of that to the tops of my
cheekbones using the zoeva one 1/4 brush
and then before I sat down to film at my
favorites video I popped on a little bit
of this guy right here this is my makeup
geek kathleenlights highlighter palette
oh I haven't been using this in my
videos because I don't want to like
shove it down your throat I don't like
doing that too much but I took a little
bit of night light and I put that right
at the top right here like only right
there boom and then I'm also going to
take some of that put it in my inner
corners because I want my inner corners
to look a little bit more golden so yeah
at this point you can throw on a nude
lip and I think it would look amazing
but since this is a lip color I was
wearing in my favorites video I'm gonna
pop this on and honestly I always tell
people who have green eyes to try to
embrace red lipstick because I think
that green eyes match really well with
red lipstick the red really just pulls
out the green even when I wear like red
clothing people compliment how green my
eyes look I don't know but I'm going to
go in with the Kat Von D everlasting
liquid lipstick in the shade project
Chimps this was limited edition but a
few of you guys told me it's still
available on the Kat Von D website and
if you do purchase this I think all
proceeds or a portion of the proceeds go
to help the Chimps I'm just going to
apply this to my mouth
okay so I just applied to four layers of
this it is a little bit streaky not
streaky it's a little bit thin of a
formula so if you do just one full layer
it won't be streaky but it'll be a
lighter red I wanted it to be a little
bit darker like this so I did two layers
so yes that completes this makeup look I
think it's so pretty for green eyes or
for any eye color you have whatever your
eye color is I like this look regardless
but if you do have green eyes and you've
been searching for a way to make them
stand out in your makeup I think this is
a good way to go but yes that completes
this video and I hope you guys enjoyed
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye what
is this like crazy long hair what is
that oh I came right off alright Horner
let go my dolls so I'm gonna take the IE
oh yeah what what the hell is that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
