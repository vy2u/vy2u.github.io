a tutorial using the electric palette
from Urban Decay
please excuse that dot on my eyelid I
did it with my eyeliner by mistake at
the end of this video and it upset me I
know but let's pretend this long there
shall we yeah so this look is really fun
and dramatic and I know it's not for
everybody but I just think it's really
cool and I do basic everyday stories on
my channel all the time so I decided to
switch it up let's go so the first thing
I want to do is I'm going to take Mac's
painterly Paint Pot and I'm going to
apply this to my entire lid this is
going to act as a base cover up any
redness and prime my eyes as well going
into the Urban Decay palette I'm going
to take the color called chaos it is a
really bright royal blue and I'm going
to pack this on my entire lid I then
forgot that I had an added tape to the
corner of my eye so I quickly add that
this is just going to make a cat eye
effect and make everything look sharp
and clean so I'm just going to pack this
on my entire lid and bring it up to the
crease
next I'm going to take this Milani
eyeshadow called Bubba cafe I believe
and I'm just going to buff this into my
crease as a transition shade it's just
going to help that blue blend out a
little bit more
next I'm going to take this eyeshadow in
the palette called urban it is a
beautiful purple and I'm going to start
building this color in my crease with a
Mac 217 this part is super tedious and
it takes a lot of work but just go back
and forth in that eye shadow and build
up the color little by little because it
is such an intense color you are going
to want to build this up and work very
very slowly and just pack it on little
by little I know it can be
time-consuming but it's better to do it
this way and then look like you have way
too much in the crease so I'm just going
back and forth dipping my brush into
that eyeshadow and slightly blending it
into my crease then I'm going to go back
into chaos and pack this onto my lid
because a lot of it did get blended away
from all the blending we did these two
colors look really cool layered on top
of each other because it looks like
three different eyeshadows on my lid one
really there's just two of them it's
really cool so now back with my 217 I'm
going back into the urban shade and
building it again like I said little by
little I'm also dragging that brush into
my crease really really lightly so that
it can blend seamlessly so I'm packing
most of the color right in the socket of
my crease and then with a really light
hand I'm trying to feather it out higher
in my crease if that makes any sense
and then again some more packing on of
that chaos color I know time consuming
is just going to go back and forth
between these two eyeshadows now I'm
just going to clean up some of the
fallout with any makeup remover wipe and
then I'm going to take the Urban Decay
Naked basics palette I'm going to go
into that shade foxy and I'm going to
blend this underneath my brow bone this
is just going to help that purple color
blend out a little bit better then I
don't know why I didn't record myself
doing that but I dipped this brush into
the shimmery shade in The Naked basics
palette and applied that to my inner
tear duct and underneath my brow bone to
highlight now I'm just gonna add some
winged eyeliner I'm going to take my la
girl very black gel eyeliner and just
add a wing and then of course I got so
close I got out of focus but as per
usual I'm going to move on to the rest
of my face and I'm going to take my Too
Faced hangover primer and this is just
going to prime my face and moisturize my
face really well
next I'm going to mix two foundations
and they're both the Rimmel stay matte
foundation and I'm just going to buff
this into my skin using a Real
Techniques expert face brush I'm going
to quickly skim through the face like I
usually do because you know it's
something you've seen very very many
times before and I think people are more
interested in the eye look in this video
then what's on the rest of my face I'm
going to take my Maybelline fit me
consider I believe this is in the shade
10 light or 15 fair I'm not exactly sure
I think it's 10 and I'm just gonna cover
my dark circles with this and highlight
my face a little bit
I'm going to set everything using max
emphasize powder and I'm using this on
an elf flawless concealer brush I
believe that the name now I'm going to
take this Milani jumbo pencil in the
shade royal purple and I'm going to use
this as my eyeliner this is just going
to make the look look extra purpley on
the bottom purpley yeah I know I'm going
to take urban again on a pencil brush
and just smudge this underneath my lash
line
then I'm going to dip that pencil brush
into Melanie's Bella cafe and I'm going
to further smoke it out so it looks nice
and smoky on the bottom I'm also going
to drag it towards the winged eyeliner I
don't know if you could tell I'm just
dragging it up towards the wing and I
should have zoomed in in this part but I
completely forgot of course then I'm
just going to quickly curl my lashes add
some mascara and then I'm going to apply
some falsies I'm going to use the Ardell
whispies and then I'm going to finish
off my face I'm going to take bend nice
powder Rouge in the shade contour number
one and on an Ecotools brush I'm going
to contour my face
I'm going to take this tart blush in the
shade exposed I don't want something
super pigmented or noticeable on my
cheeks since my eyes are already so loud
so I'm going for a natural blush for
lipstick I'm going to use my Too Faced
that lipstick in the shade nude beach
and yeah it's a really pretty new color
I love this lipstick taking my
Physicians Formula stripper stripper no
shimmer strip as well shimmer strip in
natural nude I'm going to use this to
highlight okay guys so that completes
this look I really hope you enjoyed it
