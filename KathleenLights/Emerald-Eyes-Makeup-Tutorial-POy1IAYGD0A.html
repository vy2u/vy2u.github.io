tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I am using my pallet with morphe and
I know okay so a crazy thing this intro
might be like 58 minutes long so I will
leave like a little note in the
description box letting you know when
the tutorial actually starts also excuse
my voice I think I'm losing my voice
it's a little raspy I spent all night
screaming that sounds really bad it's
not what I meant I was recently at
Halloween Horror Nights and I scream for
everything if you try to scare me I'm
gonna scream at the top of my lungs like
that's my reaction is to scream so I
spent all night screaming
so my voice is a little bit rusty but
anyway so ever since the palette
launched you guys have been asking me to
post tutorials using the palette I've
seen so many of you guys on Instagram
and on Twitter tweet me that you got the
palette which is so amazing and so
exciting so this tutorial is using this
palette and it's for those of you who
have this palette who are getting this
palette in the mail I know it's sold out
so you cannot currently get it right now
but this book is for those of you who
already got it
I am trying my absolute best to get this
palette back in stock so it is limited
edition and a lot of people were so mad
at me that it sold out so fast but
honestly that I didn't think that was
gonna happen
I have collabed with other brands in the
past color pop makeup geek my makeup
geek palette my highlighting palette it
is limited edition it just hasn't sold
out once it's gone it's gone the same
thing goes with this palette I was so
shocked to see that it sold out within
two days I did not expect that trust me
we got a lot of palettes we got a lot of
palettes a lot of people were mad at me
like how can you order so little but we
didn't do we ordered so many I just
didn't expect this which thank you so
much for supporting me and for buying
the palette you guys blew me away I
cannot believe I cannot believe it sold
out like that thank you thank you thank
you so much I love each and every one of
you even those of you who didn't buy the
palette thank you for your support for
your kind words I love you so much I am
trying so hard to get this back in stock
at least one more time I will let you
know on Twitter and on
the Grahams so follow me on those
platforms I have been talking to the
owners of morphe and i'm gonna try to
get it back one more time for you guys
so that we can at least do a second
round because I didn't anticipate it
selling out so quickly so I feel like it
would only be fair to bring it back at
least one more time so that those of you
who didn't get a chance to buy it will
get a chance to buy it that is naming
priority right now it's trying to get it
back I'm doing everything I can because
I just I hate disappointing you guys you
know so hang tight I'm going to do my
best I will update you but if you do
have this palette or it's coming to you
in the mail this is the look I created
today I used the greens in the palette I
kind of mix them both to get this like a
really pretty emerald look this is my
favorite way to use the greens in this
palette they're really really pretty on
their own but mixed together they are
magical I love the combination of the
two so that is what I did today and yeah
if you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching okay so I'm
going to start with priming my eyelids
I'm using the Urban Decay primer potion
that I always use and then I'm going to
jump into the palette and I'm going to
use this bone color to kind of set down
the primer make sure it's not sticky and
that everything blends smoothly on top
so on a fluffy crease brush I'm taking
this peachy orange shade and I'm going
to use this as my transition shade and
putting this pretty much everywhere on
my crease and then I'm going to go into
this little mustard fellow right here
and I'm going to take another blending
brush and really focus this into my
crease and just blending those two
shades together
now I'm going to take a flat shader
brush and I'm going to dip it into this
color right here it's a very mossy green
has a lot of Brown to it and I'm going
to apply this to my entire lid
and then I took a fluffy crease brush
with no additional product and blend it
out those harsh lines then I applied
this green eyeshadow right on top so I
used the same brush only I flipped it
over and applying this eyeshadow on top
creates kind of like a really dark
emerald look I really love these two
shadows paired together and then I
dipped the brush back into that little
mustard shade and I'm using this to
blend everything out making sure all the
colors look nice and blended into one
another going back into the palette I'm
going to take this cool tone gray Brown
and I'm going to use kind of like a
smaller crease brush and I'm focusing
this color on the outer parts of my eyes
and I'm also dragging this into the
crease just so that they all mesh well
together I feel like it was missing
something so I added a little bit of
that cool toned Brown and then I went
back into that mustard shade and I'm
just you know blending away just lots
and lots of blending going back into
this bone color I'm going to use this to
highlight underneath my brow bone so I
took a little bit of that eye shadow and
then I dipped my brush into this really
intense highlighting shade but I didn't
apply a lot so just a little bit of that
underneath my brow bone just to give it
a little bit something extra and for my
eyeliner I'm using the Inglot gel liner
number 77 I am like the world's worst
eyeliner drawer or whatever you know
it's really hard to do this on camera so
just apply a wing or don't apply a wing
do whatever you want but I just applied
kind of like a smallish medium sized
wing and then I decided to move on to
the face before finishing up the eyes I
primed my face using the NYX angel veil
primer and then the foundation I'm using
is the Milani conceal imperfect found
foundation this in the shade creamy
vanilla this is like extremely yellow I
have a neutral - yellow undertone but
this is like yellow but it doesn't look
so bad in the end after applying
concealer and all of that so the
concealer I'm using is the collection
lasting perfection ultimate concealer
this is in the shade fair and I'm doing
one side at a time
because it is a very matte concealer and
it dries very very quickly so I added a
little bit more and this is very
brightening but it covers really well I
love this concealer and then I applied
some of the wet and wild highlighting
and concealing pen right on top just to
balance out the color because the
foundation was just a little bit too
yellow for me so I'm just blending that
in with my Beauty Blender and then to
set down that concealer I am using my
favorite RCM a no color powder okay so
to finish up the eyes I'm going to dump
dump whoa
not what I meant to say I'm going to
jump into the mustard shade again and
I'm using kind of a thicker pencil brush
and I'm applying this to my lower lash
line and then I took the color pop creme
gel liner in the shade TSP and I'm
applying this to my waterline and I know
I'm like pulling on my eyes here I never
do that I'm so sorry but I was just
trying to apply it as pigmented as I
could so to create a little bit of
darkness underneath my lower lash line I
took that dark green shade on a tiny
little pencil brush and really smoked
out that color and then I applied some
more of that mustardy shade just to tie
everything together and to smoke it out
a bit for mascara I am taking the
essence lash princess on my top and
bottom lashes and then I'm going to
apply some inner corner highlight with
this super intensifying highlighting
shade in the palette it's my favorite
for my inner corners I think it's
stunning so I applied that to my inner
corners and then I popped on some
falsies these are the Eiler looks like
faux mink lashes and they are really
beautiful to add some black to my tight
line just so that everything looks nice
and black I used the essence smoky liner
in smokey black
so let's contour the face shall we this
is the Kevyn Aucoin
sculpting powder in the shade light and
I'm using this to contour my cheekbones
this has just become my ultimate
favorite contour powder of all time this
new like light shade it's my favorite it
chisels out the cheeks like
nothing I love it it's perfect and then
to just warm up the skin a bit I took
the BH Cosmetics satin bronzer in the
shade totally tan and this just warmed
up my skin a little bit because the
Kevin of Kwan Potter obviously is a
little bit more cool toned I also took
some of that on my neck so that
everything matched nicely like I'm
losing my voice ah okay so for blush I
am taking these you a powder blush in
the shade rose very beautiful pinky Mavi
color very beautiful I love it and then
I'm going to take the Jake at triple
crown baked eyeshadow in the shade what
is this called dulce de leche that's
right it's in the shade dulce de leche
and I'm using this to highlight my face
my nose my Cupid's bow all that good
stuff for lips I took the remote
exaggerate full color lip liner in the
shade natural and I just lined my lips
and I also filled it in with this lip
liner and then to go right on top of
that lip liner I took the NARS Velvet
Matte lip pencil in the shade patina
it's a similar color only the NARS lip
pencil is more purple so yeah that
completes this look I hope you guys
