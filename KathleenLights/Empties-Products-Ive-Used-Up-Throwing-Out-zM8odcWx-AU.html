haven't done in a really long time and
it is an empties video I found the video
like that like months and months and
months ago and then I completely forgot
and just kept throwing things away and
then I realize no I need to save my
garbage and film videos like this
because I know some people like them so
eat all of my stuff in this bag this is
just a bag I got at Sephora when I
bought the Naked 3 palette that's what
they gave me so I have just been keeping
my recent empties in this bag this is
also going to be a product I'm getting
rid of kind of thing like products that
just did not work for me I don't like
that I'm not gonna use them so I'm
tossing them or giving them away by the
way if you're wondering about my makeup
I just filmed this tutorial right now
which is why I'm wearing the same
clothes I wore in my last video so with
that being said that video should
already be up this tutorial I will link
it down below if you want to see how I
got this look if I start coughing like
crazy or I sound like Vin Diesel brought
the majority of this video I'm sorry I'm
sick as per usual Sam I'm gonna go ahead
and get started I finished up two of my
batiste dry shampoos and go through
these things like water I use them so
often just because I do not wash my hair
every single day I don't even wash my
hair every other day I wash my hair
probably about once or twice a week just
because if I wash my hair every day my
hair would be a hot mess and that's how
I kind of maintain it as healthy as I do
because I use a lot less heat on my hair
so dry shampoo is a girl's best friend
my favorite one is the fruity and cheeky
cherry but they didn't have it last time
I went I picked up the clean and classic
original which I also really really
liked it smells like lemons to me like
lemon zest that's what it smells like to
me I have been buying these at
Marshall's recently I used to buy them
at Ulta but I have been mining them at
Marshall's because they're $5.99 there
and I believe at Ulta they're like eight
dollars so if you have a Marshalls near
you just go ahead and buy the batiste
there since it is cheaper I love this
I think it's affordable and amazing and
no other direction of who compares to
these no other
I have gone through to make up remover
wipes and go through these things
extremely fast and I used to be super
obsessed with paper to be sensitive ones
and I used bills for months and months
and months but I have been trying to
branch out to see if there's something
better and I actually really really love
these these so the simple sensitive skin
experts cleansing facial wipes these are
really really gentle I love these these
are amazing I am definitely gonna be
repurchasing these because they're that
good and then these are the facial
cleansing towelettes I bought this at
the next where I used to work the Nexxus
a military base so it is the exchange
select brand which is kind of saying
like Walmart brand or Target brand but
it's the next brand but it is compared
to the ponds original clean so I'm
assuming these are like a dupe of The
Palms original clean and I really really
like these two I've heard a lot of good
things about ponds makeup remover wipes
if you guys can do me a solid and
comment down below your absolute
favorite makeup remover wipes cuz I am
on the hunt for the perfect ones I have
sensitive skin keep that in mind if you
know any that's good for sensitive skin
and won't burn my eyes
that'd be great keeping on with wipes I
am getting rid of these wipes because
they were absolutely horrific these are
the makeup cleansing tissues from
absolute absolute I guess that's the
name of the brand
these are pomegranate face wipes I got
this in an Ipsy bag and I thought oh my
god I love pomegranate I'm gonna love
these oh my god they smell like
robitussin
they smell identical to robitussin they
smell like medicine so strong the scent
is so strong that I've gagged a couple
of times smelling it
I personally don't even know if they
take off your makeup well they might
it's just that when I first applied this
to my face as I was taking off my makeup
I was like oh my god I could barely
breathe so yeah I am chucking this this
is this is awful I finished up my Rock
daily resurfacing discs these are just
little pad
I think I left one more just to show you
guys these are what the little pads look
like one side has the little bumps to
exfoliate and the other side is
completely smooth and these are amazing
it says it's clinically shown to
diminish the appearance of fine lines
and wrinkles so I definitely have to go
pick this up again it is pricey but I
think it is worth it I just I think it
really helped the texture and the
clarity of my skin I really really like
this and I definitely recommend The Rock
daily resurfacing discs another product
I'm just gonna get rid of is the Revlon
nearly naked foundation I know a lot of
people like this at first I really
really hated this but it was the only
foundation I had that matched me at the
time so I wore it all the time and then
I guess I kind of got used to it so I
ended up liking it or at least I thought
I liked it and then I bought another
foundation that is 30 times better than
this and I was like wait a minute
I was right all along this is terrible
like I said I know a lot of people love
it but I just I did not like it for some
reason it stayed wet on my face
throughout the entire day
even when I set it with a powder and I
said it I said it good ok and my face
stayed wet and transferred onto
everything and it was just wet to the
touch and I hate that about foundations
so I'm definitely just gonna chuck this
out because it just does not work for me
I finished up the st. Ives oatmeal and
shea butter body wash gently soothes dry
skin I actually really really love this
body wash but I probably won't be
repurchasing this for a long time just
because I feel like I go through it so
quickly I don't know what it is yeah
it's super liquidy that it's just like
and it's like pours some up or something
I don't know I go through it so fast
this stuff is still really really good
and it's like $3 I think I really liked
it I finished out my little travel-size
fix plus I loved it so much that I went
and I bought the big one that I
currently have this stuff is a lifesaver
for me I use it underneath my makeup I
use it to set my makeup I use it to
intensify my eyeshadows that's probably
what I use it the most for and I
honestly think it's a necessity in my
makeup collection like I need to have
this with me at all times
I finished up a
bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks find fragrance mist
this is in warm vanilla sugar this one
is really good
I'm so bummed that it discontinued my
favorite scent which is the dark kiss
why on earth would they do that to me I
don't know I literally had one like in
every room of my house it was my
favorite like over any body splash in
the world and they discontinued it it's
like why do you want to hurt me better
body works why do you want to hurt me so
I've been using this one again it's not
nearly as good but it mean it smells
nice it smells like vanilla sugar I
still have like this much left of my
dark kiss in my purse and I use it
sparingly and it's a sad day but I mean
you're like vanilla sense you'll like
this another product that I'm just gonna
toss is my ELF eyelash curler this stuff
literally rips my eyelashes off like I
don't know what it is about this because
I've heard so many people rave about
this eyelash curler and it's just like
it's like pulls them off and I don't
have that problem with any of the other
eyelash curlers I've ever used I don't
know what it is about this one but I
don't like it I finished up to
hairsprays I only buy the travel size
version of hair sprays because I rarely
wear hairspray like I I barely wear
hairspray ever ever it's the only one I
really want to maintain a really nice
tight curl that I use hair spray so I
get the little ones just cuz find the
big one to me it's just like a waste of
money but I finished the John Frieda
Frizz Ease moisture barrier from
hairspray this was awful the smell was
good like it wasn't overpowering it was
just the regular hairspray scent that
didn't linger it went away but it was it
made my hair feel like bacon not I'm
like very crispy
not my favorite and then this one was
good but I hated it is that makes any
sense actually mention this any products
I regret buying video just because the
scent is so horrific let me see I can
still smell it no not really but the
scent bothered me so much it lingers my
my hair will smell like this for like
three months okay
I'm exaggerating but it'll smell like
this for the entire day and people have
told me like Athene your hair smells
like intense hairspray and it's a good I
know but aside from the scent this is
awesome you could literally brush out
your curls after you spray this in your
hair your hair does not stay crispy it
is amazing in that category and I heard
that there is a an unscented version of
this which is great because the only
thing that's bad about this is the scent
I finished up my maybelline instant age
rewind dark circle eraser I've gone
through a couple of these I love this so
so so so much I use it to highlight
underneath my eyes and to cover my dark
circles but I'm pretty sure this has
been breaking me out of my forehead so
I'm no longer going to be using it on my
forehead but it has never eat ated my
under-eye area at all so yeah I really
love this I definitely recommend it and
it's drugstore you can't beat that
I finished the red can diamond oil deep
facets oil enriched intensive treatment
for dull damaged hair
this thing has made an incredible
difference in my hair you guys have no
idea I definitely recommend it go to
your local Ulta and pick up the red can
Diamond oil treatment because little
baby it makes your hair just feel like
like like a pony another product I am
just gonna throw away is this elf
shimmery and facial whip I don't know if
I've mentioned this in one of my videos
before I probably have mentioned that I
didn't like this before but I'm finally
getting rid of it and I got mine in the
color lilac petal and the color of this
is beautiful it has the same kind of
color as the benefit high beam like that
pinky type of highlight but this is so
sticky that it bothers me on my
cheekbones like I'll put it on my
cheekbones and the stickiness lasts all
day and it really it just it bothers me
my hair even gets stuck in my highlight
I'm just gonna go ahead and get rid of
this cuz it's a sticky it's still sticky
I have bought this little sample of the
glam glow youth mud tingle exfoliate
treatment and this stuff is amazing this
there's three of them there's the white
one the blue one and the black one this
is the black one and I love it it's an
exfoliator but it's a mask as well you
just leave it on your face wait till it
dries and then you wash it off and your
face feels amazing my sister loved it
too so I would definitely recommend it
if you don't want to spend the $70 on
that mask just check out the little tub
version of them cuz I am definitely
gonna go pick that up very soon and then
the last thing I'm finished is this dove
go sleeveless deuteron okay I'm spread
the name with this okay this one was
good at first at first you know I smell
nice and clean it was nice but I just
have the feeling that dove is not
working for me anymore I don't know I've
heard a lot of people tell me that when
you use a certain brand of Jordan for
years and years and years you kinda have
to switch it up because if not it ends
up like not doing anything for you
eventually so strange I know but I just
I feel like dove is not keeping me as
fresh and clean as it used to so I think
I'm gonna switch over to like secret or
something I don't know I'm probably not
gonna repurchase another dove do or rent
I don't know I'm in a crisis with Jordan
I know it's really weird but I am I'm in
a crisis and I love dove okay guys so
those were the things that I have
finished up recently and things that I'm
just gonna get rid of because they
didn't work for me I hope you like this

style of videos because I will continue
to do them I will not forget and I will
not throw my things away I'll keep my
trash if you really want me to thank you
