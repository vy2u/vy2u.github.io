gonna be a Teddy get ready
it is raining cats and dogs right now as
usual so if you hear thunder and
Cornelius crying you know why I just
wanted to do like minimal soft easy
makeup and I wanted to just film it for
you guys I got a ton of questions asking
me if this was kind of like a wearable
palette this is the anasazi on Modern
Renaissance and how you can do like a
very minimal makeup look with this
palette since it can be a little scary
there's like a lot of red tones and a
lot of really warm shadows that can
throw people off a little bit but you
can do like a very soft natural makeup
look and that's what I'm gonna do today
very simple very easy it's the same eye
look that I wore in my foreo review yeah
nothing too fancy or too tutorial II I'm
just getting ready like I normally am
and I'm filming it I'm going to use the
NYX angel veil skin perfecting primer
and now I'm actually going to be trying
a new product I've never tried before I
wanted to use it for the first time with
you guys this is from the brand milk
makeup they sell this brand at Sephora I
got a few PR products from them and one
of the things was this this is their
sunshine
skin tint I hope I love it because it
sounds amazing this is basically a
tinted moisturizer you're not really
going to get much coverage out of this
but I hope it's like decent coverage I
hope it doesn't feel like nothing really
nice because it is like a pump formula
like a clicker thing never really seen
it since it moisturize err in this kind
of packaging so that's really cool and
it has SPF 30 which is awesome for a
tinted moisturizer I love that and it's
a physical SPF which is my favorite when
I got this in the mail there was like a
paper explaining like all the cool
benefits to this but I pulled up on my
phone so I can read it to you it says
it's a fresh take on liquid foundation
innovative packaging incorporating
antimicrobial silver delivers a
weightless preservative free formula
with a single click it has a glass
rollerball tip that glides smoothly on
the skin this tint is infused with a
blend of avocado mandarin grapeseed and
olive oil for long-lasting hydration
that sounds awesome they recommend you
don't use a brush with this so I hate
using my fingers but I'm gonna use my
fingers to blend this in and it's also
available in eight shades I wish there
was a larger selection but I'm in the
shade light this is a little bit too
late for me we like want to have a tan
but they sent me light and fair and fair
is too pink for me so I'm gonna use the
light I'm just gonna click it like oh
says to just roll it on your face and
then I forgot about the scent when I
swatch this for the first time I guess
watched on the back of my hand when I
got it I really really do not like the
scent of this but hopefully once I blend
it in it goes away this smells like
licorice like pure pure
which I despise licorice the sense of
licorice a taste of licorice I am
someone who really truly hates licorice
but we could look past the scent if it
has all these amazing like if it does
everything it claims to do so maybe I'm
putting too much but whatever so I'm
just gonna blend that in with my fingers
it looks like it's too light but we can
work with it it's not like to not like
terribly light but it's pretty light
okay I have a feeling I put way too much
product on because uh it's feeling a
little sticky I'm gonna try it just like
Pat that in with this brush okay so now
that's blended and I actually do like
the coverage I wish I had like a shade
darker I feel a little bit like I have a
white cast so I want to pick up medium
but this feels really tacky like really
tacky this is definitely something I'm
gonna need to set but coverage wise it's
nice and it doesn't look gross on my
skin I put a lot of product on and it
doesn't look cakey or sick but we shall
see this could be like a cool thing to
throw in your beach bag because it has
SPF 30 and decent coverage but it's just
it's like sticky because of all the oils
that are in this product for underneath
my eyes I'm going to use my glossy a
stretch concealer in the shade light
just going to put that on all the dark
areas under my eyes
and on my lid as well and in between my
eyebrows I have like a red birthmark
now this concealer is very thick they're
creamy so it definitely needs to be set
but before I set that and the rest of my
face cuz Memphis a little tacky I'm
going to go in with a cream highlight I
haven't used this yet I purchased this
off the glossier website this is their
new halo scope they have two different
colors but the other one was just too
dark for my skin tone so I picked up
quartz and it actually does have rose
quartz like in the actual product which
is really cool so I don't know if I
should well yeah I guess I could use my
fingers tendon science ed I was sad
I don't know how I feel about this it
looks it looks nice but um I don't know
I definitely have liquid highlights or
cream highlights I mean that I like more
than this this just seems a little bit
greasy feeling on my hands and not too
much glow is coming off there's not much
to this I have them a ton of questions
to use my you guys can see them right
here I have the new cover FX enhancer
drops and I have never used them I have
them here on display because I think the
bottles are really cute but I've never
used them before and I'm thinking of
using them for the first time on camera
like doing a whole video like a full
face video using those highlights like
using them as eye shadow using it as a
bronzer highlight mixing it with
foundation like I want like a super
intense video all about that so let me
know if you guys want to see that leave
me a comment down below if you want to
see like a first impressions on the new
enhancer drops like using them in action
definitely let me know anyway I'm gonna
go ahead and set my my concealer I'm
using the elf small tapered brush with
my NYC smooth skin loose face powder I
really really love this powder it's like
three dollars and it's really nice it's
a bit messy but it's a loose powder I
mean
you can't really see the cream highlight
once I set my under eye concealer I'm
actually going to set the rest of my
face I'm going to use my morphe mb5 a
stippling brush with this same powder
and I'm going to set my face so I don't
know if you can tell but pretty much the
cream highlight I put down is pretty
much gone you can't see it once I set my
entire face so it would only make sense
to apply this cream highlight after
you've already set your face but it is a
very creamy like it's very emollient so
I don't think this would lay well on top
of powder there are cream highlights I
have in my collection that work well on
top of powder but this is very like very
very moisturizing so I wouldn't
recommend it on top of powder but if you
put it under powder and then you powder
your face it's like it's gone you don't
see it anymore so I actually don't know
how I feel about this but anyway let's
move on I've set my face already but yet
it still feels a little bit tacky this
is definitely something I see myself
using at the beach or the pool where all
I want to do is just rub something on my
face and then blend it in where I have
SPF and coverage but like in my actual
makeup routine it's a little bit too
tacky for me I'll be using this in my
beach bag oh man I was gonna use this I
forgot this is the pure hydrogel lift
I've never tried this before but
Michelle from Ready Set glamour talks
about this she says it's like her Holy
Grail product you use this underneath
your eyes before concealer and I really
wanted to try it out next time next time
now that we are already here I'm just
going to go ahead and do the rest of my
face makeup I'm going to contour a
little bit just a little bit on the
hollows of my cheeks I'm using my
Physicians Formula butter Browns which
this.target up and up brush and I'm just
going to
contour a bit so guys what's up tell me
a story what did you do today
what have you done today is it nighttime
for you right now or early morning what
are you gonna do today I'm going to add
a little bit to my temples here and
around my forehead just kind of try to
slim the five head a little bit the six
head okay so now I'm going to warm up
the skin I want to be a little bit more
bronzy I'm going to use my Urban Decay
beached bronzer in the shade of bronze
it's a very very warm bronzer like you
can see the difference here compared to
the Physicians Formula butter bronzer
this is a little bit cooler this one is
a little bit more warm which is really
nice in this summer at first I didn't
like this bronzer all that much but I
really liked a no so I'm just gonna warm
up the skin I feel like this bronzer
kind of makes you look like you have a
tan going all these little hairs
I'm going to take a little bit on my
nose like this just so it looks like the
sun kissed my nose and i'm also going to
bring some on to my neck so that every
sing Mack is okay so now I'm gonna do
something a little bit extra but I'm
gonna take my hourglass ambient lighting
powder this is in radiant light I just
bought this I'm so excited about it it
gives you kind of like a natural golden
glow really similar to luminous light
but a little bit warmer with that same
brush I used this is a sigma by the way
a sigma f-15 I'm going to put this
pretty much everywhere jobs to give my
skin a little bit of a healthy glow kind
of use it as blush on me even though it
looks really light in the in the pan on
me it's kind of like a shimmery warm
powder I don't know it's like really
weird but on my skin tone it actually
does really show up I'm going to go back
into my Real Techniques buffing brush I
used this for my skin tint I'm just
gonna blend out the edges here and then
for highlight I'm using this I've never
used this before this is the new exposed
highlight by Tarte I'm so excited to use
this I'm gonna use my zoeva 134 brush
one of my favorite highlighting brushes
beautiful this is kind of like a very
light champagne shade not too gold not
too white not too champagne it's a
really nice undertone I really like that
I'm also gonna take a little bit for reg
here and on my Cupid's bow okay so now
I'm gonna do my eyes this look is
incredibly similar I was actually gonna
use these pallets that I recently bought
but I think I'm going to save them for
another video to do like a more dramatic
look these are the Nubian pallets this
is the Nubian the original and then this
is the Nubian to buy the brand called
Juvia place I saw this online and I went
on the website and purchased it because
the colors were so intense and pigmented
when I saw them swatched online like
look at these colors and they are just
as pigmented as they look so if you guys
want to see a video where I use the
nubian palette actually I want to use
this one more lower because this one is
just like your neutrals which is
beautiful too but I want to use the
other palettes a little bit more
colorful let me know if you want to see
that but for now we're just gonna jump
into this guy right here I've been
loving this you know that I'm gonna take
the shade golden ochre on a fluffy
blending brush this is the Sigma e-40
and tap tap off the excess these these
powders are very very powdery and they
do have a lot of Fallout so you have to
make sure that you are tapping your
brush off cuz if not it'll get all over
your face which I don't like about this
palette but I look past that just
buffing a little bit of this color into
my crease just to get the look going I
ordered a couple things on Sephora Ulta
and Walgreens some drugstore stuff some
high-end stuff I want to do a haul and
I'm just waiting for that stuff to get
to get to me it should be coming in the
mail in the next few days so be
expecting a drugstore slash high-end
haul very soon
so many new things I've been wanting to
try out so yeah now I'm gonna go into
raw Sienna which is like my favorite
shadow for the crease I'm going to use a
different crease brush I'm going to use
this one by Sephora it's their number 10
Pro crease brush and I'm doing pretty
much the same thing it's just a like a
little bit deeper than golden ochre it
has a little bit more Brown to it I
still haven't used my new camera I just
recently purchased a new camera because
I'm so tough I'm so tired of this camera
I've had it for a long time not this
specific camera but this model for a
long time I have right now the Rebel t4i
by Canon and before that before this one
I had like the t1 I had like the
original but I've been wanting something
different I'm just not happy with this
one so I purchased where is it
it's the canon eos 80 d so I'm hoping
that that one is a little bit better
quality but I'm struggling using that I
really suck with cameras so I'm still
trying to learn how to use the ad D but
hopefully once I start using that camera
you will see a difference in quality in
my videos I'm very excited for that then
I'm going to take the brush I used
before and just buff everything
I'm going to use the shade tempura here
to highlight my brow bone I am in love
with this shade to highlight underneath
the brow bone it doesn't look like it is
anything special in the pan but it's so
pretty it reminds me a lot of sin from
the Urban Decay Naked palette like the
original Naked palette I was obsessed
sin no virgin I was obsessed with that
highlighting shade and this one reminds
me a lot of it now I'm going to take
booty ma Veda and I'm gonna use this
color on my entire lid it's a really
soft golden shade but it's not like gold
like it's not too intense where is my
ELF $1.00 brush can't find it anywhere
that's fine I'm going to use the Ofra
number eleven brush and I'm going to
pack that on my entire lid
mainly staying on the inner parts of my
eyes I don't really want to bring it too
far back you can totally wet this
eyeshadow to make it really really
intense but for a day-to-day I want
something really soft like I don't want
to something too metallic
to gold or to foiled I just want a soft
wash of color to where it's like there's
something there but like it's not too
much I'm going to take a little bit of
this dark chocolate shade it's called
Cypress umber and use this on the outer
corners of my eyes just to make it a
little bit deeper there I feel like
it'll tie the look together like it'll
look complete what what shut up I don't
even know what brush I'm looking for I
thought guy sensei gave my leghul I'll
hear this this is my trusty little
morphe five one four I love this little
thing I'm going to use Cypress number on
my outer corners
this shadow super fallout II la to fall
out tap that brush
I don't even want to take this color
into the crease I'm just adding it right
here to the outer corners do you see how
it makes it a little bit smoky like a
very natural hint right here
now I'm going to take Vermeer Vermeer
yes Vermeer and I'm going to use this to
highlight my inner corners with my
morphe to10 and then for my lower
lashline I'm going to take raw Sienna on
a pencil brush and smudge that this is
the morphe e36 I don't know what the
deal is with morphe discontinuing their
elite brushes supposedly it's because
they're going to come out with like
better brushes or something like that
but all I know is that they better come
out with a brush just like the e36 it's
the best pencil brush I've ever ever
used in my life it's the only one that
doesn't scratch my eye it's like really
soft and most pencil brushes are not I'm
going to go into golden ochre with the
same pencil brush and blend those two
colors together
and then right at the outer corners I'm
going to take this dark chocolate shade
and a little bit right here and that
completes the eye look now I'm just
going to apply some mascara I'm going to
curl my lashes with my Shiseido no no my
tweezerman eyelash curlers and then I'm
going to apply my mascara and I'm going
to use the L'Oreal carbon black the
telescopic one
seriously guys if you've never tried
using castor oil on your eyelashes I
know I keep saying it but castor oil
works miracles I got mine on Amazon I
just searched pure 100% castor oil
bought the first one I saw and look how
it's made my lashes you guys know I
burned off these lashes by mistake
coming in nicely okay so that completes
the eyes as you can see it's such a
wearable nice daytime look using like
the neutral shades or the natural shades
in this palette but to finish off this
look I'm going to use this little guy
right here this is the same lip color I
was wearing in my foreo video this is
the same eye look and this is the same
lip so this is the NYX note this is the
Tarte lip sculptor lipstick and lip
gloss in the shade basic so I'm going to
take the lipstick first
and then I'm going to go in with the
lipgloss on top I love this lip combo so
that completes this lick I hope you guys
enjoyed it um the look that I was
wearing in that foreo video was pretty
requested so I did pretty much the exact
same thing only
I switched up a couple of face products
but I just went going for this look
recently I've been using this palette
and I've been doing this look like
almost every single day and I think it
pairs so nicely with natural bronzy
glowy skin so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye hey guys so today's video is
going to be my updated skincare routine
