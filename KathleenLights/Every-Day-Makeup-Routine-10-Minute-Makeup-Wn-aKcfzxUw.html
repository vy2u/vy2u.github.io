a very simple kind of like a chatty get
ready with me I'm gonna be showing you
guys my go-to routine recently
whenever I just want to do my makeup in
like 10 minutes like if I have somewhere
to go I have to be out of my house it
really fast but I still want to put
makeup on this is the routine I go to
I've done hundreds of looks like this on
my channel before but products are
always constantly changing I'm always
using different things and I kind of
have like to go twos I have like a five
minute go-to and then like more of like
a 1012 minute go-to which is what I'm
doing today because when I really want
to get out the door and honestly all I
have is five minutes all I'll do is my
eyebrow some concealer some mascara and
a lip product and that's it but if I
have a few minutes to spare this is the
routine I like doing obviously in
today's video it's gonna take a little
bit longer than 10 minutes cuz you don't
we're gonna be chatting I'm gonna be
talking about the products with you but
it's gonna be a very very very simple
makeup look a very laid back video okay
so no matter what look I'm doing I have
to do my eyebrows obviously so I'm gonna
fill them in I think the brows are the
most important step especially for my
brows and like a very bold brow so
because my hair is darker now I have to
use a different browser this is the
Anastasio brow is in dark brown I was
using the soft Brown before but that's
just a little bit too warm for my hair
now a little bit too light so I'm gonna
take dark brown I'm just gonna fill in
the brows
all right so they're not identical but
that's what we're going with and I'm
just gonna quickly brush them up brush
the hairs up and just kind of go over
any bolt spots and usually when I have a
lot more time to spare like when I'm
doing a full-blown makeup look I'll take
the brow Pao I brought outer from the
balm and I'll just go over the brow
pencil with this it just makes it look a
little bit more natural and full but
when I ain't got to half of that I don't
do that I'll just jump into some brow
gel so I'm gonna take the colour-pop
brow boss gel and I'm gonna brush the
brows up this brow gel is really really
great at keeping your hairs in place and
making it look like extra volumizing but
it has that white tint that drives me
crazy but all you have to do is just tap
on your brows and that white tint goes
away and it'll leave your brows like
that like feathery and like okay since
guys are really easy and whenever I do
this look I'm like going really fast I
just do my face first and I'm doing a
full eye look that has a little fallout
I always do my eyes first but for the
situation I'm gonna go ahead and get
started on the face to prime minister in
I'm gonna be using my Becca first like
priming filter this is like one of my
holy grail items in my makeup collection
like halfway done with this product I
love using this whenever I'm not wearing
any makeup like without foundation at
all because it just makes the skin look
so healthy and I don't know if it's like
the purple tint to this but I love how
this makes my skin look and feel it
gives the skin such a nice complexion
and it almost neutralizes it a little
bit alright for a foundation I'm gonna
go in with a BB water or BB cream this
is the smashbox camera-ready BB water
and this has SPF 30 whenever I know I'm
gonna be leaving my house not that that
happens often whenever I know I'm gonna
be leaving my house I always put on some
SPF this part always gets changed around
I'll either put a very light layer of
foundation I'll wear a tinted
moisturizer BB cream or all that so I've
actually been wearing this BB water
again I used to really really love this
and then I kind of
using it and now I'm back to loving it
I'm in the shade light neutral and I
just squeeze some of that onto my love
is the foundation brush and I like this
because it does have sheer coverage
obviously but the coverage is enough
like it leaves your skin with a really
pretty healthy luminous glow this is
like the perfect day to day face product
you have a little bit of coverage it
still feels really lightweight on the
skin it doesn't look like you're wearing
foundation it doesn't look like a makeup
but it evens out the skin covers up some
of your redness you know I really like
this product ooh mama has to do her
mustache see all the peach fuzz just
peeking through this foundation I don't
know if I'm making this up but I did
hear somewhere that this was a dupe for
the new Estee Lauder Double Wear like
the nude nude Double Wear foundation
supposedly this has very similar
ingredients to that and I'm pretty sure
it's a little bit cheaper so I mean I
don't know how true that is I have to do
my research on that but that's word on
the street and then for concealer that
always stays the same
I take concealer very seriously I take
my foundation brush from fenty Beauty
it's a foundation brush but I love using
it for concealer I don't like it for
foundation but and I have found a
purpose for it so I'm gonna take my
handy dandy Tarte shape tape concealer
it's my go-to you already know and I'm
just gonna apply some of that right here
I like to focus this kind of like on the
nose a little bit because I get a lot of
Darkness right here on my inner corners
can you see that I like a lot of a nudge
there so I drag that up a little too
high so I like applying some right here
and this is such a full coverage
concealer you do not need a lot of this
product not with the shape tape at least
I'm just gonna buff that and I love this
brush just blends in the concealer so
fast
and it's very stiff so it blends it
really well but it's very soft so it
doesn't like hurt the eye or anything
all right and usually when I do like a
regular makeup tutorial I'll highlight
the rest of my face with this but ain't
nobody got time for that
but I'm gonna set my under eye concealer
and I'm gonna set the rest of my face
just a little bit I really like the glow
that this gives my skin but it can be a
little bit tacky so I'm only gonna set
my under eyes and just the areas where
I'm gonna apply bronzer I'm gonna take
my photo focused pressed powder from wet
wild this is the shade warm light and
I'm gonna take my BH Cosmetics number 3
brush this is in collaboration with it's
my ray-ray
she actually collabed with them on an
eyeshadow palette and on a ton of
brushes which I go look how pretty these
brushes are these rotors are gorgeous I
love them not wait to use them it's
actually the first time I'm gonna be
using piece so I'm gonna use the number
3 brush and I'm gonna set my under eye
concealer with it whenever I'm doing my
makeup and I'm like concentrating on my
makeup my nose starts to run it's like
all the little juicy boogers just will
flow down TMI probably but that's okay I
love this powder too by the way don't
let the drugstore price fool you this
feels like a high-end powder I love it
for bronzer I have been loving this
bronzer I got in my Ipsy bag oh my gosh
it is amazing it's a collab between Lisa
Frank and glamour dolls if they're
bitten and bronzed matte bronzer I went
on the glamour dolls website after
discovering this because I wanted to
purchase the other Lisa Frank products
that were there but they were sold out
so I couldn't get my hands on it but I
bought this little whale eyeshadow brush
from glamour dolls really cute and I
hope they do more things at Lisa Frank
cuz this is a super affordable bronzer
and it is very very good it's like a
five dollar bronzer guys I'm gonna take
my Eco tools press precision powder
brush I cannot say the word precision I
feel like it's a position
I like this bronzer because even though
it's matte it gives you a nice warm glow
to the skin it makes you look nice and
tan so I have been really really really
enjoying it it's very pigmented though
so be careful
I love this bronzer I don't know what it
is about it you're really really
freaking love it okay so four bless me
to take the blush I've been wearing
non-stop this is the Burt's Bees toasted
cinnamon blush it's the perfect everyday
blush especially for this time of year
it's like nice and folly and wintry I'm
gonna take the itsmyrayeraye BH
Cosmetics number one brush I'm gonna use
this to add my blush even though it's
not a blush brush that's okay I never
use brushes the way they're intended to
be used and I really love this blush
because it always looks good with your
bronzer it just meshes so well with the
bronzer well no matter what bronzer it
is and you never have like a line that
divides your blush to your bronzer it's
just it goes it pairs well for highlight
whenever I do looks like this I hate to
pack on like a really intense metallic
highlights I always go for a very
natural highlight so I'm gonna be taking
my essence pure nude highlighter first
I'm gonna take my Real Techniques bo1
brush and I'm gonna apply some of this
to the forehead and to the cheeks just
to add a little bit more glow but since
it's a powder kind of like sets down
that BB water while adding a glow and
then with a more precise brush I'm gonna
take this one from BH Cosmetics and it's
my ray-ray it's the number five and I'm
gonna be very precise with this I'm
gonna pop this right on the top of the
cheekbones when you layer this product
the glow really shines through and you
believe this thing is like three dollars
I tell you
that's all the glue I need for the eyes
I do something very simple something
that's not gonna take too long and
something that's not gonna frustrate me
so I automatically avoid winged liner
and falsies whenever I'm doing minimal
looks because so for the eyes I'm going
to show you my go-to everyday look using
my dream Street palette this is
literally the look I do whenever I don't
really want to put on eyeshadow but I
want to put a little bit of something
you know when is you be wee okay so
obviously my eyes are already primed and
set because I used concealer to prime
them and then I set them with that
powder so I'm gonna take shooting star
on a big fluffy brush this is the Sigma
e 50 M is take a little bit of shooting
star and I pop that on my lid all over
the place now with a large fluffy crease
brush this is the Sephora Pro 10 brush
I'm gonna go back into shooting star and
I'm gonna buff this color into the
crease and I'm really really gonna blend
this out and then I'm just gonna take
that exact same color along my lower
lash line completely across and I'm
gonna be using the itsmyrayeraye number
7 pencil brush I have to say the minute
I saw this pencil brush I just knew I
was gonna fall in love with it because
it's the perfect size it's not too big
it's not too small and it's not scratchy
at all which is amazing thank you girl
you really did a good job on this one so
many people so many companies get pencil
brushes wrong and they make them so
scratchy but this one is good so I'm
just gonna run that across
I'm gonna highlight my brow bone and my
under corners with the shade Moony right
here favorite I'm gonna take thee it's
my ray-ray number eight brush and I'm
like I said on my inner corners as well
I'm gonna take some of this shade onto
the lid here just to open up with the
inner part of the eye okay so now I'm
gonna take elfish and I'm just gonna
smudge a little bit of this color really
close to my lashline but closer to the
outer corners just to create kind of
like a smudgy eyeliner look I do this
all the time you guys have seen me do
this a thousand times
I'm gonna take a little bit of this
shade and drag it out you can kind of
see I've been doing it on this side here
just to create like the illusion that my
eye is being pulled out kind of like I'm
an eyeliner a winged liner but it's just
an illusion oh by the way this is the
equal tools micro smudge brush I have
been loving these new Eco tools brushes
I have like a little bit of a cut here
on this side of my eye because when I
was doing winged liner the other day and
I went to clean up my eye I scratched
the crap out of myself with my nail and
I bled a little bit so that's why this
side looks a little bit dark and weird
and I'm gonna take a little bit of this
color right here on the lower lash line
focusing it on the outer corners I don't
want to drag this color too far in
because then it gets a little bit too
smoky okay so the eyes are completely
done now I'm gonna pop on some mascara
to finish off the eyes and I'm gonna go
in with my benefit roller lash I'm gonna
hit my lower lash line with mascara as
well
sometimes when I'm gonna rush I don't do
this step but I do want to apply just a
little bit of this and we are pretty
much done I'm just gonna pop on my lip
product I'm gonna be taking the ultra
satin lip from colour-pop in the shade
dreamy this is one of the three new
shades I just collabed with color pop on
okay so I like to overdraw my lips a
little bit because I have pretty small
lips and I like them to look a little
bit more full this is the finished look
obviously the lip product changes
everyday but of course I've been loving
this shade and I love how this color
pairs with this eye look but you know we
are done okay guys that completes this
video this has been my go-to look
recently I would actually love to know

just gonna pop on some mascara today I'm
