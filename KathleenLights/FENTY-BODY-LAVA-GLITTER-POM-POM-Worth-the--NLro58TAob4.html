a very very exciting one I'm so excited
to sit down and film this it's gonna be
a review slash first impressions demo
application on the new fancy products
I'm so excited
Fenty Beauty came out with this body
lava body Luminizer and this glittering
pom-pom I have been so excited for these
products second they were available on
Sephora I immediately ran and purchased
it so that I could do this video for you
guys and I know there are tons of people
who already have this video up who have
already reviewed this but I thought
maybe you want to hear what I think is
well maybe maybe we like the same things
maybe we have the same skin tone I don't
I don't know but I'm here to give you my
thoughts my first impressions and we're
gonna apply it to the body this area
here and we're gonna see how it looks
not gonna lie I've been reading some
mixed reviews especially on Sephora I'm
a little bit nervous I really really
really want to like this because I mean
I think this is the best packaging I've
seen in a really long time her packaging
is incredible and I'm a huge packaging
person like I love packaging and I mean
even just the boxes like look at these
boxes the only thing I didn't purchase
was the face and body kabuki brush I was
like I have kabuki brushes at home do I
really need it but then after a couple
days later I regretted it and then I
purchased it but it doesn't get here til
tomorrow and I'm planning on posting
this video tomorrow so that doesn't help
me we're just gonna use a different
brush I figured there's gonna be tons of
people out there who might purchase this
product but not purchase the matching
brush because a lot of us have brushes
at home and/or maybe a lot of us want to
use our fingers I don't know but for the
sake of this video I will be using my
Tarte kabuki brush this is just like a
giant tear kabuki brush the fenton one
is a little bit stiffer and like it
looks like it's a lot more dense but
we're gonna use this and if all else
fails we'll use our fingers okay so I
haven't even opened this box I am so
excited
amazing let me do it through the box
okay
Wow this Wow
just just wow this is a lot bigger than
I thought it was gonna be this is like
holy cat this that's me I want to
display this this is so beautiful in one
of those Blitz packaging gets a huge a
plus for me now I don't know if the
packaging is the reason this is so
expansive because this bad boy is $59 60
bucks from body Luminizer that's a bit
steep we'll see if it's worth it but the
packaging is definitely worth it like if
you're gonna price this at 60 bucks and
better come out of packaging like this
you know what I mean so wow this is
beautiful and I got the shade who needs
clothes she does have two shades I
figured this one was better for my skin
tone the other one just seems too deep
for me I will say this does look very
very glittery and I don't like glitter
but I don't mind it on the body I hate
glitter on the face like on the cheeks
but on the body I like it in the spring
and summer like I'll rock it let's just
see how this formula goes and then the
other product is the fairy bomb and this
says it's a plus shimmer packed puff and
it gives you an instant body glitter
this is the shade Rose a on ice by the
way these products are limited edition
but yeah why is this so difficult this
is so looks I feel like this is kind of
like Charlotte Tilbury packaging we
haven't really seen a company well
recently we haven't really seen a
company come out with things like this I
remember back in the day my mom used to
have something very similar to this I'm
going to try this one out after okay I'm
just gonna shake this up I don't know if
you have to but I'm just gonna shake it
up this does come at home I don't know
if I should just like drop it you know
like Rihanna today everybody's doing it
okay
hmm I feel like this brush might
actually soak up a lot of the product
mmm this smells so freakin good
I'm actually not is this wait it says
it's a limited edition gel based body
Luminizer made to veil skin in a
glorious dewy high shine finish this
doesn't has a floral vanilla scent
I don't smell the floral but well I
guess oh my god but it just smells so
good it smells like vanilla okay I'm
gonna try one more time here with the
brush but I might apply it with my hands
look at that it does feel sticky though
like it feels oily and I don't I don't
like that feeling but we're gonna push
through it let's see
I feel like less is definitely more with
this product but I just want to see how
it applies with the fingers hmm I just
made it more intense it just makes your
hands all glittery but you to just wash
that off you don't need a $34.00 brush
okay so this is definitely more of like
a dewy finish like a sweaty dewy finish
it's not so much a sheen or a shimmer
because their other body Luminizer so
I've tried in the past they're a little
bit more cream based and they're they're
kind of like liquid highlighters this is
not like a liquid highlighter this is a
dry oil kind of maybe not as dry as a
dry oil it's a little bit oily with a
bunch of shimmer in it so this is more
to give your skin that sweaty wet look
not so much that highlighted Sheen and I
would imagine that this texture would
probably be awkward if you're like
hugging someone and it probably won't
get on your clothes the like the glitter
but this is this shoulder let me add
some more back here it's a little make
so this is the shoulder and this is the
bear shoulder I'm actually gonna apply
the glitter pom-pom on this side it
smells so freakin good though
okay so the fairy balm retails for four
to two dollars which is also pretty
pricey for what it is but let's see okay
so I'm just gonna like I don't know they
say that you need to dab this on to the
body oh yeah I totally see it
you have to like dab a little harder but
I definitely see it oh wow wow I put a
lot right there holy cutoff you want a
little bit of a shimmer this is super
cute but it is pretty expensive I feel
like you're kind of paying for the
experience like
oh I bet you it would make this site
look really intense cuz it would have
that oil to stick to this would probably
be really nice to like set the oil down
yeah nevermind but it does make it
shimmer here I'm gonna zoom you in now
just so you can kind of see the shimmer
I'm not even sure you can see the
shimmer on there but it's shimmery okay
I'm gonna add some more of the body lava
on this side okay so I do like the doing
is I like the glow I like that this is
making me look a little sweaty I like it
but I'm actually gonna wait about five
minutes and I'm gonna see if this maybe
dries down I probably doesn't I know
it's an oil but maybe it gets a little
less tacky I don't know but I will be
right back to give you my final thoughts
we're gonna wrap up this video and I'm
gonna tell you how I feel so I have
mixed emotions about these products
first let me talk about the body lava a
few things I love about this I love that
it has a pump I love the packaging it's
absolutely stunning killer best
packaging they could have done I love
the scent I keep smelling myself like
that look like I was trying to smell my
armpit but I smell so vanilla Reed I
love the color it's so Universal because
there really isn't a base color to it
it's not really a liquid highlighter
it's just a bunch of rolls gold silver
and pink shimmer kind of like thrown in
this mixture this like oily mixture
because of that this can suit so many
different skin tone anybody can really
wear this color even the fairest affair
to the deepest of deep I think I also
like the glow it gives my skin like when
I'm sitting here I'm looking in the
mirror I love this glow
it does look sparkly but it just looks
so summery and fun but a couple things I
don't like I don't like that this is
kind of oily it is getting tacky so the
oil gets even tackier as it's sitting on
your skin which wouldn't be a problem
for me if I'm not planning on like
hugging anyone holding someone's baby or
something sticky and it is tacky so if
you don't like anything sticking you
will absolutely hate this and that being
said I feel like this would be perfect
for summertime the only thing that
concerns me about that is okay so I'm
gonna apply my SPF underneath this right
lather up my body with SPF and then I
would put this on top hey guys I'm so
sorry but the next few minutes are a
little bit blurry for some reason my
camera decided to focus on the board
behind me and I don't know why but it's
been doing this recently does anybody
know if maybe I did something wrong did
I click something on my camera but for
some reason recently it has just been
focusing on the board behind me or on
objects behind me and it never used to
do that before and I just didn't notice
because I still use my viewfinder I
don't use a big monitor or anything so I
didn't notice I was out of focus so I'm
so so sorry but the next few minutes are
a little bit out of focus or a lot of it
out of focus but then it does go back to
normal
towards the end so I'm so so so so sorry
don't be bad and because it's so tacky I
kind of feel like if you were to jump
into a pool or like if you were to get
into the ocean I kind of feel like it
would stay so maybe that would work but
I feel like it would be kind of awkward
to reapply sunscreen on top of this I
don't know I think it would also work
for a night out like if you're gonna go
clubbing I feel like it would look so
nice underneath the lights at nighttime
or like in flash photography like I
think aesthetically it is really nice
but I don't know if I would use this
that often even though I like it I did
like this product I'm not loving it I'm
not completely blown away for me it's
just it's too sticky and it is a $60
product so I'm gonna say I don't think
this is worth your money I would say go
to Sephora get a sample because it is a
very specific texture for me it's okay I
like the look it gives me but it's not
something I'm like yes I need this you
know and the same goes for this for me I
find that this is more worth it than
this even though this is pricier for $42
honestly you can get any loose glitter
you have in your collection or like a
loose shimmer powder and just like throw
it on the body
less money I feel I just I hate to say
it but I just don't think it's like wow
you need to run to Sephora get it right
now it's just okay in my opinion I just
feel like it is a lot of money but I'm
still gonna use it and I'm still gonna
make it work I wonder how this would
transfer like if I hug somebody with a
white shirt on you know I'm gonna grab a
white shirt Margaret hello darling
haven't seen you in so long I actually
don't don't say anything except little
tiny little specks of glitter I mean the
shimmer transfer is just a little bit
but because this isn't really a color
and it's more like tacky oily it doesn't
really get on Margaret murder it's fine
you can totally hug Margaret if you're
wearing this it's okay anyway guys that
completes this video those were my
