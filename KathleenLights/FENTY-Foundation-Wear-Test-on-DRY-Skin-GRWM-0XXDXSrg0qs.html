highly requested video and I'm so sorry
I'm just finally getting around to
filming it it's been it's been crazy few
weeks but a lot of you guys have been
asking me to test out the fenty beauty
foundation and I have been keeping this
on my desk for a few weeks waiting for
this video to film it because I wanted
to try it for the first time with you
guys on camera
I want to give you guys my first
impressions and I also want to do a wear
test on this we're on in today's video
and then I will come back at the end of
the night and show you guys how it were
through out the day I think that's super
helpful so we're definitely gonna do
that I am a little bit scared I think
this is targeted for those of you with
oily skin but I've loved matte
foundations in the past like the all
nighter foundation from Urban Decay is
one of my favorites there's a few I
really like and if I moisturize really
well sometimes I can get it to work so
that is what I'm gonna do with this guy
and hopefully I love it at least I hope
so because I actually think 34 dollars
for this foundation is not so bad
considering how expensive foundations
are at Sephora they're like 40 50 s even
$60 so I think of $34 foundation is
pretty good and I think the packaging is
really nice I love this frosted bottle
like I honestly expected this to be
priced higher in my opinion just because
it's Rihanna you know I'm actually
pleasantly surprised with the price on
this foundation at least just that's
just me so I did pick up the pro filter
instant retouch primer I don't want to
use this for the first time if I've
never used the foundation because what
if I don't love this primer I don't want
it to mess up how I feel about the
foundation so I will be trying out this
primer on my own time I love this
packaging is so pretty
I actually have a few fancy beauty
products to try out in this video as
well I mean this video is based on this
foundation like that is what this video
is about they're gonna test it out I'm
gonna give you my thoughts but I will be
throwing in a few other things as well
I'm gonna be doing my full face I'm
gonna get ready right here and yeah
let's just get the ball rolling alright
let's do it so I'm going to pick up my
hair okay so because this is a matte
foundation I'm gonna go in with a super
hydrating moisturizer and I'm gonna use
this as a primer as well this is the
Kiehl's ultra facial moisturizer and i'm
gonna load this up on my face this
really does just hydrate the crap out of
my skin
and usually Matt Foundation's just apply
better on top of this moisturizer we can
move on to the foundation it says to
shake low I picked up the shade 180 but
I know this is too light for me I just
guessed
online she has like 40 shades the shade
range is amazing it goes from very light
to very deep so I love that I'm gonna be
using it my Beauty Blender to apply this
um I here this dries really really
quickly so I am gonna work in sections
actually that's not too light and I do
hear a talk says that not oxidizes but I
hear it gets a little bit darker so
actually that color isn't bad at all
okay so the coverage is like medium I
would say that's nice
okay so I'm noticing just a little bit
of dryness around my mouth in between my
eyebrows and around my nose which
happens to me pretty often with some
matte foundations because I have very
dry skin which a lot of you know I can
just kind of see it sitting on the skin
in this area let me see if I can zoom
you in I don't know if you can tell you
probably can't tell on camera you have
to get really close to see it but it
kind of looks a little bit dry in this
area it's not extremely noticeable you
do have to get really close to my face
to see it but just in case you have very
dry skin I'm just letting you know okay
so I'm gonna go ahead and apply some
concealer just because this foundation
is pretty matte I'm gonna go in with my
Maybelline fit me concealer it's like a
dewy or hydrating concealer and then I
will come back and we can try out this
bad boy oh and by the way it's actually
not too tacky usually when I apply this
underneath my foundation no matter what
the finish stays a little bit tacky and
this one isn't too tacky it doesn't feel
you know it feels kind of like skin
that's really nice I like that so just
mentioning that and to apply this
concealer I'm gonna be using the Effendi
Beauty one one zero foundation brush I
know it's a foundation brush but I just
loved the brush so much so I wanted to
buy it it's such such pretty packaging
but I knew I wasn't gonna use it for
foundation I never used brushes like
this but I thought maybe for a concealer
it would be perfect
okay I don't know if it's because of
this found nature or the fact that I
haven't used this concealer and a super
long time but I don't love how this
concealer looks I'm gonna pop on to
another concealer I'm gonna use some of
my Catrice liquid camouflage concealer I
will say I kind of like this brush for
concealer it's pretty firm but it's very
very soft so it doesn't feel scratchy
underneath the eyes at all it's like
very very soft and I like the shape you
can get like right up in here so now I
would usually apply some in between my
brows on my nose and on my chin just to
even out the face but I don't want to
apply too much because I really want to
see how this foundation wears in this
area and like my problem area and I'm
gonna add a little bit on the tip of my
nose here and on my chin a bit
alright I'm gonna test out the penty
Beauty invisi matte blotting powder and
Universal it's just a translucent
setting powder that's supposedly like
invisible on the skin so I'm just gonna
use that to set everywhere I put down
the concealer it really does look
invisible on the skin even though it
looks kind of white but it's pretty
translucent I'm also gonna put some a
little bit on the rest of my face just a
little bit
okay it looks really nice and smooth
underneath my eyes and really like that
okay so I'm really quickly gonna apply
my bronze are in my blush just because
they're not new products or anything but
I'm gonna contour with my NARS Thalia
contour powder I'm gonna bronze the skin
with my color pop private-party bronzer
and then I'm gonna apply some of my bare
peach blush from Burt's Bees and then I
will be back to try a fun T highlight
which I'm very excited about let's just
crunch myself
all right so I bought three FNT beauty
highlights it cannot find moon metal
anywhere or metal moon it's the one
that's completely white with like a
golden undertone and then these two are
split down the middle
these are the kilowatt freestyle hazard
or duo's I got mean money and hustla
baby and then I got girl-next-door and
Chic freak mmm I think I'm gonna I'm
gonna turn this one yeah I think I
wondered this one this one worries me a
little bit because this one is very very
glittery and you guys know how I feel
about glittery highlights I don't love
them but this one when you swatch it on
the skin like on your hand it doesn't
really look glittery I don't know it's
watches nicer than it looks so I'm gonna
take my favorite highlighting brush this
is these the wave of 1:34 brush and
first I'm gonna dip into like the more
sat inside mean money okay so this one
is very very very subtle you can kind of
see it a little bit but this side is
very natural
this would actually be perfect for you
if you're very fair but I don't love it
I don't hate it but I don't know it's
not my favorite I'm gonna take a little
bit of the other one though I'm gonna
take girl-next-door this one right here
I'm feeling this one is like beautimous
oh yeah oh yeah on top this one is the
more natural of these two but it shows
up a lot more than mean money this one
is so beautiful I do want to add a
little bit more bling on top of it so
I'm gonna go back into this one and I'm
gonna take hustla baby and I'm gonna
play just a little bit of this at the
very tip of my cheekbone here let's see
how that looks this highlight is
literally perfect for you if you're
going out at night clubbing or something
like this what it's gonna add a little
bit of that sparkly one on my nose oh my
God look how intense that is all right
so I want to make sure this highlighter
just melts right into the skin because
it is so intense right now I'm gonna
take my morphe setting spray and I'm
just going to set the face
okay so after applying that setting
spray wow that even made my foundation
just like sink into the skin I think
this foundation really needed a setting
spray you know what I think that's what
it was missing like it melted into my
skin and now it looks more skin like my
face is pretty much done I'm really
quickly just gonna add a little bit of
eye makeup just cuz I really want to try
this out this isn't like a first
impressions on this or anything I'm
probably just gonna speed through this
part but I really want to try out the
bare minerals hidden treasure palette
this is what it looks like I just
purchased this because it was full of so
many neutrals I could I couldn't pass it
up I love how you get a super cool toned
role here the only thing that throws me
off about this palette there's so many
light shades like right here like so
many light shades and not enough deeper
shades I wished it would have been just
a few more crease colors or like outer
corner colors and I would have liked
like more crease shades but besides that
they're very very pigmented and they
just feel really creamy and I mean these
are all super essential colors you know
so I'm just gonna play with this really
quickly and then I will try on this lip
gloss that I have been dying to try out
ever since I bought it
so yes
okay so to finish off this look I'm
gonna go in with the writing is still
tiny fancy beauty gloss balm and in the
shade offend teeth blow this gloss looks
so gorgeous and it looks so pretty on
everybody and it smells really really
really good oh my god this tastes and
like smells like old school smackers and
it's so weird cuz I never thought I
would put on a gloss this color and
actually like it but I you do I don't
know there's something about it I would
probably love wearing this gloss with
like really really dewy skin and just
mascara and brows as well I don't know I
really like that gloss so that was
pretty much everything by the way I
really like this eyeshadow palette
everything blended it so nicely so I'm
just gonna wear this foundation for the
rest of the date and then I will get
back to you at the end of the day with
my final thoughts hi friends I just woke
up from a nap like 10 minutes ago and it
is 11 p.m. that means I am NOT going to
sleep tonight I don't even know how that
happens I don't take naps during the
week I don't take naps often so it is
time to analyze this foundation I've had
it on for about 8 hours now because I
did my makeup at 3 o'clock so it's been
on for 8 hours that's a pretty decent
test and honestly I think it held up
pretty well for 8 hours my phone nation
is still on my contour is on you could
see my highlight not so much on this
side this head is a bit patchy err
because this is where I fell asleep as
you can see here on my sweater
I have foundation on it because I like
knocked out my base on my couch so I did
wear off on my cheeks but I didn't
really powder my entire face you guys
kind of saw me just like put it on my
home and I'll just dust it a little bit
on so maybe if I would have set my face
better
it wouldn't have rubbed off so much when
I was sleeping but this side still looks
like perfect so I definitely think it's
pretty long wearing on my skin I
actually asked Danny how he thought my
foundation looked and he was looking at
me and he was like well you look a
little glossy and I was like really
thanks I always wanted
and he also did say that it looked a
little Qiqi around my nose which I
totally agree I said that in the
beginning of this video it looks great
on the rest of my skin but around my
nose and on my chin it does look a
little dry and cracki
so I don't love that I have a ton of
other foundations that don't do that to
me
so this honestly wouldn't be the first
foundation I reach for and this is
probably a really good foundation to mix
with other stuff oh you know what I love
how the luminous silk foundation looks
on my skin but I don't like how it makes
me look greasy in like an hour so maybe
if I mix those two foundations one is
very luminous and one is very long
wearing on me maybe that combo would be
perfect I have to try that if I have a
feeling I'm gonna like mixing this
foundation with like dewy stuff I
actually got a few comments from you
guys letting me know that the Catrice
foundation is actually very similar to
this one I have to test those two out
because now that I think about it maybe
that one is very matte as well I have to
test those two out together but yeah and
I'm just gonna zoom you guys in so you
can see how my face looks after eight
hours so I mean it's not bad I have
other foundations I do like more than
this one but I've tried foundations that
I've absolutely hated and I don't hate
this at all actually I'm really
impressed with the way it lasted on this
skin I still have to play around with it
more obviously this is only the first
time I use it I mean what do you think
how do you think it looks on my skin let
me know down below anyway the rest of
the products I use I love even the gloss
it's has completely rubbed off now
because I ate and everything but I loved
it it's super pretty and yeah guys that
completes this video thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye our split our split
down
and honestly I you never never make a
wish</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
