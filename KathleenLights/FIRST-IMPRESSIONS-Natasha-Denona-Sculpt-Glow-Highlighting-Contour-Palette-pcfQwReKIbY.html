going to be a review and demo on the new
Natasha's and ona scopes and glow face
highlighting and contouring this is what
it looks like it's like a reflective
mirrored packaging so you could totally
see every my god I don't typically do
reviews like this anymore like on one
specific product but I kind of miss
doing them and then when I saw this on
trend mudar on the internet I was
floored I was like oh my gosh no she's
not no she isn't coming out with
something so glorious look at this it is
amazing I have never tried this before
so I am going to be doing an entire
first impressions in this video today
but when I thought on the internet I was
like I need to have that and I need to
do a video all about that because I want
to try it on camera for the first time
just so you guys can see my initial
first impression and all of the times my
first impressions don't go very well I
changed my mind a lot a lot when I'm
trying out a product but I thought we
would do it anyway so I did purchase
this one myself this is in the shade
light/medium I purchased this the second
I saw it when my aunt Sephora loved
addition of them that I got a little
carried away because Natasha's been on
it says send me PR and I actually got
this palette again today along with the
shade medium dark so I have both of them
to compare I didn't buy medium dark for
myself because I knew I would never use
it but now that I have it I can show you
comparisons like in this video and I
have a couple of spots like I'm a little
bit skeptical already and I will tell
you why in a second but yeah let's jump
into this review already I have
foundation on my face and I have
under-eye concealer and that is the only
thing I have on my face right now and
mascara my brows you know but on my face
just Foundation and concealer and I'm
going to be jumping into the sculpting
glow palette in the shade light/medium
really quickly though let's talk about
packaging I absolutely love this
packaging I think it is stunning it is
so beautiful like seeing it in person
all you want to do is hold it it's very
heavy
it feels pretty luxurious and it has a
ginormous mirror right here and it's
actually really fantastic mirror now on
to the actual inside she has 3 cream
products and 3 powder products this one
right here is the highlighting cream so
if you want to do like extreme
highlighting and contouring with like
the stripes all over your face this is
the product you would use it's not
really a concealer but it is a creamy
highlighting product and
you get like the typical setting powder
down here and for it being light medium
this is a pretty dark powder I have a
feeling it's going to show up a little
bit more yellowy on my skintone if
you're really really fair this might be
too dark for you but it is a light
medium palette so that makes sense then
you get your creme contour and your
powder contour I'm a little bit worried
about this because this looks pretty
dark like this looks very dark actually
like compared to my skin tone and then
you get your face glow cream shimmer
which is like a creamy highlight and
then you get your powder highlight and
honestly the reason I purchased this
entire thing is because I have the
natasha's anona glow powder highlight
this is in the shade 0-1 light and I
love this highlight so much it's so
natural yet so glowy and beautiful I
love it so I figured I would really
really love this one I actually think
it's the exact same color
the single feels more pigmented than the
one in the palette well you can't really
tell this one is the single and then
this one is the one in the palette can
you see a difference but anyway I really
love the fact that she has this little
flap right here and it covers all of the
cream products which is a lot of the
times the power will get into the cream
product and then create kind of like a
mess with all the kick up especially if
your rough with your makeup if you just
like and I really just wanted to do this
video because this bad boy is $89 yes
you heard me correctly $90 for a
highlight and contour palette that is
crazy to me that is a lot of money you
can get the cat 1v1
for much cheaper but that one doesn't
come with any cream products so I don't
know I don't have anything to compare
this to because I don't have anything in
my collection that has cream and powder
like this except maybe the Kevin a Quan
book Gemina Quan has a contour book
that's $65 and that's a luxury brand in
itself and $65 is a lot so this is 90
this is even more expensive than Kevin
upon which I mean Natasha's anona is a
very high-end brand and I have to be
honest they make the best eyes shadows
I've ever tried like all across the
board
I love color pop I love makeup geek they
have amazing shadows but I have never I
just ID'd Natasha's and own eyeshadows
are incredible and hopefully this is
another amazing product hopefully it's
worth $89 I don't know we will see right
now so I just want to quickly show you
in compares
I don't want to swatch this one because
I do want to give this to Amelia
you look like she would get more use of
that and I don't want to put like my
fingers and her stuff but I just wanted
to show you this is the light medium and
this is the medium dark am I crazy or
are those contour powders just way too
similar and I'm talking about the powder
not the creams but they seem really
really similar like this contour powder
is not much darker than the one in the
light/medium palette I don't know I
can't speak for this one because I
haven't swatched it yet I just watched
these you know what let's just get into
em traitors are like shut up just do it
alright let's do it okay so I'm actually
going to start off with this shade right
here this is the highlighting cream and
I'm going to take my little Kiko face
500 brush I'm lessee so I gotta put on
this right and I'm just gonna dabble
into this little bad guy right here
little bad guy huh
okay so ah okay I get nervous with for
first impressions okay so I'm just going
to highlight my under eyes a little bit
I already have concealer on the
concealer I'm using is the Wet n Wild
photo focus concealer I have that
underneath I just want to see if this
brightens up my under-eye well it sure
do be sure I didn't want to use this as
like a concealer because it's not a
concealer it's a highlighting cream so I
wanted to see how this looked on top of
concealer and it doesn't seem to be
breaking up the concealer or making the
concealer look weird but it did really
highlight my under eyes and I'm going to
take some right here so that I could
just highlight the rest of my face and
make everything even the bridge of my
nose and on my chin okay so now I'm
going to go into the contour cream right
here I think it might be easy to blend
I'm going to take my little beauty
blusher carefully just because I feel
like a damn sponge is going to help the
contour blend a little bit so just going
to put these on the light oh oh maybe I
shouldn't have gone so crazy
okay so it's not difficult to blend I
think it takes a little bit longer to
blend than like my cover effects
bronzing liquid that I love so much I
compare everything to that because it's
my favorite cream contour but it's not
difficult to blend out like a lot of
things I've tried in the past so yeah I
think that looks pretty good so I'm not
going to apply anymore because I am
going to go in with the powder and I
feel like this contour is dark already
but this side looks a little strange but
I do think it's good I'm just going to
go ahead and finish up with the cream
products I'm going to take the face glow
cream shimmer and I'm going to play this
the tops of my cheekbones with the same
sponge just with this side I swatch this
and I pretty much got no pigmentation
like look I couldn't really see anything
there it's just like a little bit of a
sheen I don't know if this is just meant
to look wet on the cheeks and not really
come off as like highlighting you
definitely have to pick up a lot of
product it does give you a little
something but not as much as I would
picture from a natascha Venona
like cream highlight just a little bit
too sheer for me yeah it's very very
subtle which I mean could be a good
thing or a bad thing depending on who
you ask
I'm trying to see if it picks up my
foundation underneath or like if it
looks weird but it doesn't seem to be
clinging on to anything or like
disrupting anything underneath it kind
of just gives me like a clear Sheen like
a wet look it's not bad but it's
definitely my least favorite product
I've tried so far okay so now that we
have clothes to this I'm going to take
the Japanese I didn't even know that
Japanese pressed powder holy I got my
cheeks look wet here like on camera you
can I tell but in person like my
facebook sweat like because shiny it
looks here I'm kind of like a hand on my
Sephora Pro sculpting blush brush I'm
going to apply that
to my undereyes to set my concealer and
my cream highlight and oh yeah mm-hmm so
dark for me yep fetal sees that is too
dark for me that's trainable and that it
that kind of killed a lot of the
highlighting quality I had going on
there for my under eye powder I
definitely prefer something a little bit
more brightening this you can't tell but
if you look up close the yellow tint is
pretty strong and it's like the exact
same color as my skin tone and I prefer
something brightening underneath the
eyes so one thing I notice when I touch
my cheeks like this highlighting cream
is very sticky so I mean like most
highlights are but the coverfx ones I
keep talking about those but I love them
the coverfx ones do dry down completely
and they don't stay tacky this is like a
weird single weird highlight I like it
because I like how what my cheek looks
like it doesn't even look shimmery like
they look wet but I don't know if it's
practical or if I'm going to really use
this that much I'm going to go ahead and
take my charlotte tilbury airbrush
flawless finish
powder and I'm going to set my entire
face before I go in with any of these
cream products because I mean powder
products because that is what I would
probably normally do on a normal day
anyway obviously applying this powder to
my face totally killed off the highlight
I just put on but I really just wanted
to try out that cream product just to
give you my thoughts I figured I was
going to cover it now with powder anyway
you know what this would probably be
good for this creamy one for like a
finishing touch at the very end of your
makeup like if you have really dry skin
and you want your cheeks to look like
wet like on a summer tropical vacation
that would look really pretty on the
cheeks and anyway so now I'm going to
take the contour sculpting powder keep
grabbing it with this hand and I'm going
to use my little NARS
yah-tchi ole brush I think that's what's
called and I'm going to flip it into
dance and I'm not going to apply too
much this powder does have like a strong
gray undertone which is nice for
contouring I'm just scared it might be
too gray on my skin
well it's actually not too dark for my
skin tone see what happens when you
assault so this actually looks more
pigmented in the pan then it comes off
on your face which I actually really
like because it's easy to build and I
thought I was just going to draw like a
crazy gray stripe on my face I thought
it was going to be really pigmented
right off the bat but I like that it
isn't
okay so what do you guys think of this
contour actually think it looks good and
even though I set the highlight I feel
like my crazier is a comeback that
contour powder actually surprised me it
was something that I thought it was not
going to like but I think it blends
really nicely you think everything like
that okay so now let's move on to the
last product and it is the all-over
shimmer powder probably going to love it
don't be surprised if I'm like so
definitely adding that cream highlight
underneath made it even more vibrant
than it would usually look this is one
of those highlights that you do have to
build up but having this cream
underneath really made that highlight
powder stick to it and it's really
showing up like really glowy here on the
cheek I think that looks really good
this is very beautiful okay guys so
those were all the products on my face
what do you guys think seeing it from
the other side of the camera what do you
guys think of this palette based our
first impressions I like it I do I
actually love it I do love it I think
this is pretty good I don't like this I
think this is really good this is pretty
good and I don't really love this like
these two products are not my favorite
because if I'm going to be truly honest
with you I don't know if I'm going to
use this it's just feel like it's more
professionally because it's like that
wet highlight now for the big question
do I think it's worth $90 I don't think
so
only because I'm not fond of two
products I might use it but most likely
I only use four out of the six so I
don't know if it's worth the $90 for me
if you fall in love with each individual
products then totally but for me I don't
know if I wear purchases and I don't
know if it's worth $90 I do love it
though I do love it I'm going to
continue to use it I'll probably give
you my thoughts later on when I play
around with it a little bit more because
you know my opinion changes quite
frequently when it comes to products I
really have to test something out to
give you like my full review so this is
just the first impression if this was
cheaper like if this was in like 60
bucks even 20 dollars cheaper it's 90
and I feel like you might be able to get
other sculpt and glow pellets
other brands for a little bit cheaper
and I'm I'm so sorry to say that because
I respect Natasha bill and I love
watching her tutorials my jaw drops
every time she does somebody's makeup
her style of makeup it's like my
absolute favorite I love everything she
does everything she's a goddess in my
opinion so I'm a little sad saying that
I'm like on the fence with this but this
was just my personal opinion leave me a
comment down below what you think about
this palette have you tried it have you
seen it at Sephora like what are your
thoughts on this palette what do you
think about the price point just leave
me your thoughts down below yeah these
are my opinions and that completes this
video I hope you guys enjoyed this quick
first and quick I hope it's quick so see
when I'm editing quick first impressions
on this product I actually want to do an
entire first impressions on em cosmetics
Michelle Phan actually sent me like all
of her new lip clouds I think they're
called and then her two new eyeliners I
think those are the only things that
have been introduced to M cosmetics and
I have all of them and I haven't tried
them yet so if you want to see a full
first impressions with lip swatches of
all the M cosmetic stuff let me know
down below and I will do that for you
anyway that goes with this video thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye
very very good I thought it smelled
strong but no so I know I already ended
this video but I'm actually sitting here
about to do the swatches on my hand to
show you like a close-up this is a
culotte am I crazy or a sleighing
nothing coming off on my fingers that is
really strange
there's almost like this weird layer on
top but coming off on the brush so why
is it showing up on my skin like with
the brush but not like with my fingers I
don't know that is super weird it's like
swatching so Belleci I had to scratch
like the top layer out that's a little
bit weird that it's not really swatching
but it did show up on my face as you saw
so I'm going to pretend like that's not
an issue that might be an issue while I
use it more I will let you know the more
I use this now this video is done my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
