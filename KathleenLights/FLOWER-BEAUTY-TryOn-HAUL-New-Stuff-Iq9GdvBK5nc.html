forgot to film an intro to this video so
I'm just giving you guys a quick little
intro right here with my voice this is a
flower beauty haul slash get ready with
me I am hauling some new flower makeup I
just recently purchased on their website
and I am putting it on for you guys you
know kind of like a try on haul so let's
get started okay so we're gonna get
started applying some primer I picked up
three of the new flower Beauty primers I
got the flower okay all of this stuff is
flower so I'm not gonna say that every
time but I got the in your prime
hydrating primer then I got the in your
prime pore minimizing primer and I also
got the illuminating primer I think the
packaging is really cute on these
bottles I like that they have different
colors these kind of look like color
correcting colors but they aren't color
correcting primers so that can be a
little confusing for today's video I'm
actually gonna be mixing two of them I
got the pore-minimizing one just to try
out but I'm a hydrating slash
illuminating kind of gal I'm gonna
squeeze oh that's too much
a little too much since I'm doing two of
them but that's okay I'm gonna try to do
like equal parts
I actually swatched both of them on the
back of my hand before I started filming
this and the hydrating one just looks
like a moisturizer going new side it's
like a white consistency and the
illuminating one kind of has like a
champagne reflect but it doesn't have
shimmers in it or anything chunky it's
actually a very like smooth consistency
you know it's a nice sheen my face
actually feels a little hydrated but not
too much and I feel like I put a lot on
and I don't feel like my face is super
hydrated so maybe I could have used a
little bit more of the hydrating one but
it does look very illuminated so that's
nice I feel like this one is very nice
the illuminating one
get a nice Sheen you know it does what
it's supposed to do but I don't think
the hydrating one is very hydrating at
all okay so really quickly I'm gonna go
in with my foundation and concealer
since the flower doesn't have any new
products in that category I'm gonna use
my Maybelline matte and poreless I'm
gonna show you 120 and then I'm gonna
use my Milani
retouch any race concealer in light and
I'm gonna be using my Beauty Blender
actually was gonna use my flower sponge
but it is so dirty which is strange
because every single time I use a sponge
I wash it immediately after but I used
that sponge last night and I guess I
forgot to wash it so I'm gonna use a
baby bun
all right so far Beauty did come out
with versus a powder well actually two
powders I have two powders share with
you guys this is the miracle matte
Universal finishing powder this is a
translucent powder I mean it says it's
translucent well it just says miracle
matte Universal finishing powder
minimizes appearance of imperfections
and it gives you a mattifying effect so
this is to mattify and then this powder
is the complete opposite is the miracle
glow satin finish powder it says it also
minimizes the appearance of
imperfections but this one gives you an
ambient glow that's your makeup with a
veil of subtle radiance our satin
formula absorbs oil and smoothes the
skin with a soft focus effect so I'm
really excited about this powder what I
think I'm gonna do is apply this to my
t-zone even though I have a drier t-zone
I kind of like in the center of my face
to look a little bit more matte it's
just a little harder for me because it
is so dry it's it's a bit of a struggle
so I'm gonna apply this part to my
t-zone and then I'm gonna apply this to
the rest of my face even though this
foundation doesn't need to be set we're
just gonna do it for the sake of this
video I'm gonna take my zueva 114 brush
and I'm just gonna dip it right into
this powder set underneath my eyes one
thing I am noticing is that it's kind of
lightening underneath my eyes it's not
like a drastic difference but I
definitely see this side a little
brighter which if that's what you're
looking for awesome but if you are
looking for something that is like
invisible on the skin you can't really
see a color I don't know if you would
like this but with that being said oh by
the way there is a mirror in this
product there's a like a little spongy
thing and then a mirror but anyway the
color is a little bit white but I feel
like it did a really nice job of
blurring my pores I don't know I'm like
on the fence right now I don't know how
I feel just yet I have to play around
with it a little bit more
now I'm gonna try out this bad boy I'm
very excited for this powder the
packaging is a little bit crazy okay so
this is like their universal color but
it does have a bone color to it it's not
completely white and it is very chewy
very chewy there's a definite glow in
this so I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques bo1 brush oh my gosh okay
wait hold on this is very pretty but
it's it does have a definite Sheen to it
so I feel like I applied a little bit
too much in that area okay I'm sorry if
this mirror is in your way I'm sorry I'm
just trying to look at my face what do
you guys think can you see a difference
when I move my face around I see a
little glow there
at first when I stamped it here on the
cheek and I saw so much shimmer I was
like oh my gosh I'm gonna hate this but
if you apply a very light layer to your
whole face you set your foundation but
you do get a little bit of a glow it's
not something that's very very
noticeable I think in order to really
tell you're gonna have to apply a lot I
like it actually I think that's really
nice okay so really quickly I'm gonna
apply some bronzer I'm going to speed
through this part I'm gonna use my
Physicians Formula but a bronzer
by the way I'm using the colour-pop
powder brush in case anyone was
wondering okay so I'm gonna take my
flower Beauty lift and sculpt contouring
palette in medium to deep and I'm gonna
take the bronzer I'm just gonna take a
little bit of this because it's a very
pigmented and I'm just gonna lightly add
some of this bronzer towards the back of
my cheeks okay so since she doesn't have
any like brand brand new blushes either
I'm gonna take the blush in this palette
with my morphe m4 62 these powders are
so dusty like you get a lot of kick up
but they're so so pretty okay so I'm
just gonna add a little bit of that but
I am gonna take a pinch of this blush as
well this is the flower pots powder
blush in peach Primrose and I'm just
gonna take the same brush and apply a
little bit of this just to add a little
bit more of a peach enos there I love
this blush it's so pretty I love it a
little bit okay so I'm gonna apply my
highlight after I do my eye makeup uh
yeah that's not gonna happen because I
completely forgot to put on highlight
because that's what I'm gonna use the
news setting spray but we're quickly
going to jump into a quick little eye
and makeup thing she just released some
new eyeliners and I picked up four
colors these are the glossy gel
eyeliners it's supposed to give you
intense color it's a gel formula and
it's also supposed to be long wearing
with a beautiful lacquer finish so I got
black vinyl bronze out silver fox which
is really weird I don't think I have a
great eyeliner in my collection so I
wanted to try that out and then I also
got galaxy which i think is a black with
a little bit of sparkle to it let me
swatch these for you okay so all of
these eyeliners
except for black vinyl have a bit of a
sheen to them a little bit of glitter I
don't know how often I'm gonna use
galaxy just because I don't really use
shades like that in the waterline I
really just wanted to try it out but if
I'm gonna wear a dark color like that
nine times out of 10 it's gonna be black
but the rest of these colors I
definitely see myself using them
maybe not the silver one but I think for
a cool tutorial that might be really
interesting they seem very creamy and
like they're gonna be really easy to
apply I was hoping that this would be a
matte brown but we're just gonna go with
it I mean it's called bronzed ow what
was I thinking so come on Kathy okay I
don't know what it is about this
eyeliner but it's like extra tickly I
don't feel like burning my eyes or
anything it's not irritating but it was
like really tickly while I was applying
it like my eyes were just so tickly I
don't know how else to describe it but
this glides on so easily and I actually
really like the color it's a little bit
more wearable than I thought it was
gonna be I thought you were really gonna
see the shimmer peek through but it
pretty much looks like a matte Brown
with a little bit of something so I
really like this color this eye is like
bigger than this eye and I feel like as
I get older I notice it more but anyway
alright so I didn't pick up any
eyeshadows from flower beauty because
she doesn't have any new pilots or
anything
I do enjoy these eyeshadows that she
recently released I like these way more
than these she has these quads right
here which by the way if you didn't know
drew barrymore own flower like she
created that if you're a little bit
confused on why I keep saying she but
she has these quads they are a little
bit dusty so I feel like they fade on
the eyes a little quicker than other eye
shadows I have but I do like them
they're not terrible and with a good eye
primer I mean you can make it work but I
do 100% prefer these so I'm gonna just
do a quick simple like barely there I've
I mainly want to focus on the products I
hauled so really quickly I'm going to
speed this up I'm gonna use a little bit
of this eyeshadow palette first I'm
gonna do my brow bone highlight with an
eye shadow that I can't tell you
yeah so sorry I keep hinting at this I
know I'm sorry but it is coming soon I'm
just gonna quickly highlight my brow
bone with this even though I shouldn't
be highlighting my brow bone because I
have so much hair they're highlighting
my hair is not a good look I have to do
my eyebrows but you know I feel like I
don't feel completed without a brow bone
highlight and I'll do my eyes and then
I'll be right back
okay so I'm pretty much done I'm just
gonna take that shade I used on my brow
bone just a light wash of this on a
fluffy brush and I'm gonna focus that
right on the inner parts of my eye
and then to finish it all off I'm gonna
take this color
I'm gonna take this tart gifted mascara
and this is what I'm gonna use on my
eyes because it kind of has a brown tint
to it it's kind of like a dark dark
brown mascara and I think it would look
you know kind of good with this and
before I go in with my lip color I
actually purchased two setting sprays
from flower these are brand new they are
the seal the deal setting sprays I got
the long-lasting and matte finish one
and then the hydrating dewy finish so
obviously I just bought the matte one to
try out for you guys I'm probably gonna
use this on my own maybe update you guys
in a future video I want to use this
with like my dual ear foundations but
I'm already way too matte for me to use
this so I am gonna go in with the
hydrating one the mist is pretty fine so
like super fine actually I really like
this mist you can get super close feel
like with this one you really have to
apply a lot I don't feel like it's
making my face too dewy right like I can
even do more I'm gonna let that dry for
a second and then I will come back and
let you know my thoughts but before I do
that I'm gonna apply some lip liner I
got three of the new lip liners these
are called the petal pout lip liners I
got nude toffee and beige these are
supposed to be rich in pigment and it's
supposed to have a precise definition I
think I'm gonna apply toffee I'm gonna
swatch them for you guys first though
woah okay this is really strange think
they might have messed up this can't be
this can't be this can't be the
situation I'm gonna zoom in so you guys
can see this so this one in the light
packaging is called nude and this one in
the darker packaging is called beige but
when you swatch them beige is actually
really really light and nude is a bit
deeper so from left to right you have
beige which totally doesn't look like a
beige it looks extremely nude then you
have nude which is like a really pretty
pinky nude and
you have toffee which looks exactly like
how I would expect toffee to look so I
don't know if my noon in beige are mixed
up that's a little strange but to be
safe I'm gonna go in with toffee they
feel really creamy and I like that these
are retractable so you don't have to
spend time sharpening them oh my gosh I
love this color so much these are very
creamy like I said so it's really easy
to fill in your entire lips with this
you can totally use this as a lip liner
but also as a lipstick the only thing is
obviously if you use this as a lipstick
as well you will go through it a lot
quicker than if you were just using it
as a lip liner but I use lip liners as
lip sticks out of 10 and they don't
transfer I feel like these are gonna be
really long wearing yet really
comfortable I'm excited but I am excited
for these alright so before I move on to
the rest of the lip products I just want
to touch base on the setting spray I'm a
little bit shocked feel like it set my
face and then it kind of went back to
normal I don't know can you guys tell do
you see like a definite doing this in my
skin now I feel like it looks just as
mad as it did before so I'm not sure oh
and also my face feels pretty tight
which can be a really good thing because
it feels like it kind of locked my
makeup into place which I don't really
expect from a hydrating setting spray I
figured this would do something like
that
I could just imagine how matte this is
actually so I don't know I love the mist
on this if this is really long wearing
and this could be a really great product
but if you're looking for the do eNOS
you're not gonna find it with that one
okay so the last portion of this video
is focused on lip products she released
a buck ton of new lip products she came
out with miracle matte lips which yes
yes liquid lipsticks I purchased all of
them I literally I don't know why but I
did I got so nuts that I purchased every
color she also released some new
lipsticks I gots I got five of these
these are the petal pout lip colors they
come in different finishes I got most of
them in a
finish but I did get two creamy finishes
and I got most of the nudes here so show
you those and then she also released mix
and matte lip duels you get a lipstick
on this side and then a gloss on this
side so you can use them together or you
can use them on their own which these
are almost identical to the Tarte ones
we should let me grab a Tarte one so you
can see well this is the Tarte lip
sculptor it's a lipstick and lip gloss
this lip gloss used to be a nudey pink
and it has changed color it used to be
like the color of the inside you see
like this wand I have a feeling I have
to throw these away comes with a lip
stick and then it comes with a lip gloss
these look just like these let me open
these I'm so unprepared
these are flower ones they're gorgeous
by the way this packaging is stunning
you open it you get your lipstick on
this side and then you get your gloss on
this side I got seven colors I'm not
sure how many colors are in the line but
I bought seven of them and all of these
glosses look like they are very shimmery
let me swatch these ooh wait a minute
this one does not feel like a gloss at
all this almost feels like a liquid
lipstick this one in bronze Envy let me
try one of the nude ones this one is
called honey nude I just want to test
out the gloss part because I'm kind of
picky about my gloss formula I like them
to feel glossy you know wow this doesn't
really feel glossy either I don't know
if I'm gonna love the gloss part I'm
gonna go into some arm swatches of these
mix and matte lip duos I picked up
all right so before I go into the
swatches of the miracle matte lip I do
want to test one out on my lips by the
way that was everything I got I pretty
much showed you everything I bought
already most of this is lip products but
anyway I'm gonna go in with the shade
rosewood
they smell really good okay so it's a
little hard to tell because I am
applying this on top of a lip liner but
they're a mixture of like all liquid
lipsticks I felt they're a little bit
creamy yeah a little bit moosie as well
just a hair liquidy but mostly creamy
and swatch it on my hand not too long
ago and it is almost completely dried
down okay so it does transfer a bit but
I don't know if that's because of the
lip liner I put underneath I don't know
I think I'm really really really gonna
like these I'm gonna go ahead and show
you arm swatches of all the colors right
now
okay and then ask for lipsticks like I
said I only got six shade I got two
creams and formats I wore one of the
matte ones yesterday which one did I
wear
I wore this one in naked blush and it
was really really nice the formula was
awesome it lasted a really long time it
doesn't really smell like anything so I
really liked it I'm a little stuffy now
actually but anyway the creamy ones I
haven't tried out yet but I'm just gonna
apply a spiced petal right on top just
to feel it out what you're probably not
gonna see the creaminess really shine
through because I have a matte lip
underneath those that was stupid and it
does feel nice and creamy though it's
not too creamy it's kind of what you
would picture a regular lipstick feeling
like one that isn't labeled a matte you
know just like a standard cream lipstick
this one is spiced petal but I'm gonna
go ahead and pop in some swatches of
these lipsticks
all right so those were the lipsticks I
picked up and then that completes this
haul that was everything I got on the
flower website if I think this video is
so long let me know if you like this
video if you kind of liked this style

picked up any of the new flower make up
