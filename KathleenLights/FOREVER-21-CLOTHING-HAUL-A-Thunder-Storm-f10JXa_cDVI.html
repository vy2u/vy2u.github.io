a chatty haul I recently picked up a few
things from the forever21 website and
I'm going to share them with you today
I'm not sure if you can hear that but it
is raining so hard and it is thundering
so loud and the three dogs are here with
me in my bedroom this is my bedroom by
the way and the dogs are usually okay
with thunder like you see Porter's like
knocked out he's good but Cornelius is
terrified of thunder like terrified so
if you hear him cry sporadically
throughout the video it's cause it's
thundering Serena's in here - she's just
under like the little bench I'm sitting
on so I got a couple things from
forever21 and I want to share them with
you even though I honestly just got a
couple of things like and they're mostly
tops and they're really basic and
whatever but I wanted to share them with
you because I wanted to just sit down
and talk about clothes for like a little
second I've been a little bit stressed
out with a lot of anxiety because
certain things are coming up that are
making me really really anxious and I
feel like this is gonna get my mind off
of things just sitting and filming this
video and I really love forever 21
because everything is so affordable
excited before but even though the
clothes don't last as long as like
clothes at Nordstrom or whatever they're
so affordable you know I'm saying you
know I'm saying okay so let's just get
started
I picked up a denim jacket and I have
been wanting a denim jacket this color
forever I have one but it's a little bit
darker than this I wanted one that
almost looked white in certain parts and
of course I found it at forever 21 this
one is shorter than I would like this
one kind of stops at my waist and my
other jean jacket is a little bit longer
which I prefer but I really like how it
looks I love the color I love how
comfortable it is and honestly like jean
jackets go with everything go with
leggings they go with shorts they even
go with denim as well I love denim on
denim I don't care what anybody tells me
some people say that you're not supposed
to wear denim on denim I wipe my ass
with Nate I just wear whatever I want to
wear
gosh it's called their casual jacket
light denim and I got mine in a size
small this one is $29.90 which isn't bad
for a jean jacket I'm gonna try my best
to link everything down below I'm pretty
sure that all of this stuff is still
available on the website because I
pretty much just ordered these things I
also got this top at forever 21 the
other day I will link it down below if
you're interested I love watermelon it's
like my second favorite fruit of all
time after mangoes and I think it's a
fun shirt it's just a basic t-shirt I
live in basic t-shirts I got really
really cute socks at forever 21 I'm a
sock hoarder so I saw these on forever
21 they came in a pack and I mainly
wanted them for these right here look
how cute this is their dog bones how
cute is that
and they came in a pack with like these
regular white socks these gray ones and
then these striped ones right here I
like to wear my socks around the house
these are not the kind of socks I wear
with sneakers I like solid black socks
for my sneakers but when I'm wearing
like my Nike sliders like I like fun
socks and then it also came with this
one seriously look how cute that is I
know it's not fall yet we're still
totally totally in summer and in Miami
is it really ever fall not really I got
these really really cute plaid shirts if
you look in my closet right now it's
almost it's almost sad how many plaid
shirts I have because for the fall time
I'll just put on a hat put on some jeans
put on some boots put on my plaid shirt
and I'm like good to go
I really love dressing up like to go out
to an event but for my day-to-day life
I'm really mainly focused on comfort and
plaid shirts are so comfortable I love
it
these are not like that flannel material
I used to wear those a lot when I lived
in Mississippi but here you're back in
Miami I like wearing this type of
material where it's you know not flat
I'm really good at these halls aren't I
anyway I got this one because I figured
I could pair any lipstick with this
plaid shirt and it would look good like
a red lip a pink lip because the colors
are so neutral it's just like a cream
and a black it would look good with any
lipstick this one is very baggy and a
little bit sporty in my opinion like
with some ripped up jeans and a hat I
think it would look really cool and then
I got this one because shockingly enough
I'd
have a black plaid top oh I forgot to
tell you the price of this this one is
$29.90 and this one is $19.90 I'm not
exactly sure why this one is like $10
cheaper they feel pretty similar
printing these systems off the bed to
lay right next to Celine's body my gosh
the Thunder is on another level can you
guys hear that but this one's cool
because it's black and white but then it
has like these lines of a raspberry
burgundy color which would look really
pretty with guess what a raspberry
purpley lipstick it would look so nice
with this shirt
love me some plaid and this one is also
pretty baggy but I really like that look
with plutt gosh border I have to take
you to the groomers you look crazy so if
you know me in real life you know that
leggings are my life I wear leggings
everyday black solid leggings lit
literally like on a daily basis and I
saw these on the forever21 website and I
ripped off the tag because I wore them
already so I'm not sure how much they
were but they were so ridiculously
inexpensive but the cool thing about
these is that they are cutout leggings
they have like these you can't see that
but they have these little cuts on the
knees and I love that I think it's such
a fun little twist to leggings really
like I had thrown all of this like stuff
in a box a couple days ago because I
knew I was going to film so all of these
clothes are wrinkled I definitely have
to take an iron to them very soon
especially this shirt right here that
I'm gonna show you but I got another one
of those shoulder tops and I really
really love these kinds of tops I love
anything that's off the shoulders but
they can be kind of annoying because
they're always falling and you always
have to fix them or if you like lift up
your arms they like come onto your
shoulders but what's cool about this one
is that it has rubber on the inside like
it has it stitched all the way around
like this rubbery texture so it doesn't
really fall down your shoulders which is
really really nice I love this top the
only thing I will say about this top
that I don't love is that it's kind of
flared out at the bottom it's not a
shirt that goes straight down so it
makes me look a little bit boxy so I'm
thinking that maybe I can wear this I
kind of tucked into some pants even
though it totally gives me like grease
sandy vibes at the end of the
I mean I know her top in the movie is a
black but she's wearing like an
off-the-shoulder shirt and it's tucked
into her pants
this was $22.90 okay so I got another
jacket and it's another one of those
casual jackets only this one looks
completely different than the other one
it's still that denim look but it
doesn't feel like denim I love this you
can just throw this on any tank top and
it looks so cute with some leggings with
anything with boots with sneakers these
little jackets look so cute in my
opinion and I love hoodies like I love
hoodies in my jacket so that is a major
plus for me this one was $34.90 okay so
this topic was a little bit disappointed
in it was so cute on the website and it
looked so nice on the model this is a
crop top so you just wear like a crop
top and then it has like this string
thing and then it's a choke I will show
you a clip of me wearing it but it
looked so nice on the model it just fit
really weird here in the neck area it
was kind of loose on me like it looked
baggy but it fit perfectly fine on the
rest of my body and I'm not one of those
people who have like beautifully long
extremities I am still gonna keep it
because I know that's something I can
get fixed I could just get it tailored
if there's one thing I really wish
forever21 would do like forever21 if you
ever watch this video please please we
need a petite section I love misguided
and I love Topshop and Nordstrom even
has a petite section where they cater to
people under five three which I feel
like is so important and so many brands
don't do that because I struggle when I
buy their pants I struggle when I buy
their long skirts their maxi dresses
they're always way too long on me now
all of us are tall okay so I'm gonna
link these below I'm going to link
everything below but you guys need these
shirts they are so comfortable and just
so easy to pair with any outfit there's
just little like little tops like long
sleeve tops
that scared the absolute out of me
this video mess this video is a mess and
I know it's just like a basic Long
Sleeve but I feel like tops like this
are kind of like a wardrobe staple you
can pair it with anything and they're
only $8.90 so I got one in black and I
also got one in this really really
pretty mustard shade this one isn't as
flattering as the black one this one
kind of like shows indentations on your
body like my bra looks really weird in
this top I have to wear it with a
different bra so keep that in mind if
you're someone who is self-conscious of
like really tight clothing or not tight
or not tight but fabric that's like
close to the skin that marks everything
this mustard one does that all right I
have this video up here just kidding
just kidding I'm not I actually have two
more things to share with you before my
power goes out forever let me let me
make it fast okay this other shirt I got
I picked it up because I have been
obsessed with this color I'm all about
this like rosy dusty pink color I want
everything in this color but I don't
like this shirt it's one of those shirts
that look like kind of business II or
like an office kind of shirt I just feel
like it looks kind of weird on me I want
you guys to let me know I'm gonna keep
it until you guys let me know I feel I
have a feeling you might agree with me
it looks a little bit too boxy for me I
look kind of strange like my body it I
don't know I look a little bit weird in
this shirt so even though I love the
color I just don't think this kind of
top looks good on me so yeah um that is
pretty much it the only other thing I
bought was this cap like this baseball
cap it just reminds me of Instagram like
the kind of hat a girl would wear on
Instagram that's all girly stupid but it
says mood and I think it's really really
cute and I wrap up this video because
okay I'm gonna unplug literally
everything in my house and that
completes this video sorry that my hair
looks like I have been electrocuted this
whole video I haven't brushed it I
haven't really tried it all with my hair
today I apologize thank you guys so much
watching and please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
I used to wear those a lot when I oh hey
guys so today's video is going to it's
okay it's okay into it with boots with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
