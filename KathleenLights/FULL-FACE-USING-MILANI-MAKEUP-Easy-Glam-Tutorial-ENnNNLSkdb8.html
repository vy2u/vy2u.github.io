sort of a makeup tutorial kind of but
it's gonna be a full face of just Milani
makeup so it's a very very affordable
look I don't know what I want to do yet
I just know I want to use the new Milani
bold obsessions and must love mattes
probably and there's also a few things I
want to discuss about these palettes
something I noticed but yeah we're just
gonna be talking about Milani today all
the colors are here are very natural
everyday colors some plums but mostly
warm Browns and gold's and stuff like
that so obviously today's look it's not
gonna be anything you've probably never
seen before but I still wanted to do a
full face using Milani because I feel
like I haven't done a full face of
something in a while and I don't think
I've ever done a full face of Milani so
that's very very exciting I love Milani
it's one of my favorite favorite
favorite brands at the drugstore they
have so many top dog products that
compare to high-end makeup it's
incredible so you know what let's just
get started so I'm gonna start off with
the eyes and normally I would just use
concealer as my eyeshadow primer I do it
all the time if I was gonna use my
Milani concealer as my primer because I
don't have a Milani primer and I used to
have one but guess what
can you think you're good I lost it I
don't know how I keep losing everything
so I am gonna be using something that's
not Milani just for the eyeshadow primer
I've actually never used this before but
I don't know if you guys follow Dickie
tutorials I'm sure you do her tutorials
are amazing and she actually did a video
that was like the best eye shadow primer
in the world it was titled something
like that and she was talking about this
P Louise base I don't know I had never
heard of this person before this brand
but she sold me on it
I immediately purchased it when I heard
it talking about it so it's gonna tap
that on to my eyes and I have never used
this before I don't know why I decided
to do both of my eyes at the same time
I've never done that that's weird
I'm gonna take my must loves mattes
palette and I'm gonna go into this bone
color right here and I'm gonna use
to set down that eyeshadow primer okay
so to save some time I'm gonna do the
eye part in like voice-over mode I just
took the most loved Matt's palette and I
use this brown shade called toast of the
town oh that's a cute name toast of the
town and I'm applying that on the outer
corners and in my crease as well then I
used this shade to highlight my brow
bone and then I'm taking this reddish
brown shade it's called hiking in Sedona
the names are on the back of this
palette and I have like the palette in
front of me but I'm taking this shade
and I'm doing the exact same thing I did
with the first shade just applying it on
my outer corners and dragging it in my
crease and then I'm going into the bold
obsessions palette and I'm gonna take
that red shade called
read between the lines and I'm applying
that on my entire lid and then I took a
brush with no additional product and I'm
just using this to buff out the crease
and to blend any harsh lines and then
I'm gonna take that shade right next to
that red color it's called blazing hot
and I'm gonna apply this on my entire
lid I did use the Milani setting spray
to wet the eyeshadow but then I just
ended up applying the eyeshadow with my
finger I just found that it applied
better that way then I took this brown
color and I'm using this to blend out
the crease and I took this brown color
very very high in my crease I kind of
wanted this red look to be everywhere
almost up to my brow bone but I took
that really light white color in the
bold obsessions palette and then I took
the shimmery color underneath it to
really make my brow bone pop and then I
used that deep plum to deepen out the
outer corners for the inner corners I
took that shade as hands of time it's
what I used underneath my brow bone but
I applied a lot of it on my inner
corners and it's so amazing and intense
like it's amazing I love it so I cleaned
up the eye area and then I took this
supreme Kohl Kajal in black and I
applied that to my tight line and then I
took this really really old and expired
Milani eyeliner because I didn't have
anything else but it was awful was
already dried up I was shaking the crap
out of this
yep you just don't see it because I
added those parts out but it really was
a struggle to get this to work for me I
mean I got it to work but it was really
old and expired and it ended up
irritating the crap out of my eyes later
on that day I added a V black eyeshadow
to it because I felt that it looked a
little bit shiny and that did the trick
okay so really quickly I'm gonna move on
to my face before I finish up the eyes
like usual and for primary men to take
the prime protect SPF 30 face primer I
will say when it comes to Milani I think
the category that has never Wow me is
their primary category like this primer
is okay I don't love it I don't hate it
it has SPF 30 which is nice but besides
that I think it's okay for foundation
I'm gonna be taking the Milani conceal
imperfect two-in-one foundation and
concealer I have the shade creamy
vanilla I don't remember if this is my
correct shade I haven't used this
foundation in forever and I used to love
it so much but then I kind of stopped
using it but I remember loving the
finish so I'm gonna give it another go
so yeah that seems like a good match the
only thing that sucks is the shade range
as usual when it comes to drugstore
this is very yellow for my skintone and
the crazy thing is that it's 0-1 creamy
vanilla I think this might be the
lightest shade that they have a middle
man besides the color I love how this
looks on my skin man that just made my
skin look really smooth I'm just gonna
try to blend that down my neck a little
bit for concealer I'm gonna use one that
I've used for a really long time I
really like this I use it on and off
this is the retouch any race light
lifting concealer and I do find that it
just like lifts your under eyes and it's
very very hydrating the only thing I
hate is the applicator it's like this
little sponge and it drives me bananas
see like I hate just but I do like how
weightless this is I wish I had more
coverage but I do really really like it
and it blends so easily it's like pretty
maybe Linden and then I'm gonna put some
here just to even out everything and
highlight the face of it
I love this combo right now my skin
looks so nice in person it is
Creasy though so let's go ahead and set
it I'm gonna be using a variation of
powders today for underneath my eyes I'm
gonna take my prep set and glow
illuminating transparent powder this
isn't my favorite for underneath the
eyes
I actually prefer this to kind of set
the entire face but since I don't really
have an under eye setting powder from my
lot from Milani that I like I'm gonna
use this I'm just gonna lightly tap that
in I've never tried this before but I
want to set my face with this this is
the concealer perfect shine proof powder
it comes with this little like thing
here I don't use it I got the shade nude
I feel like this would be better for
oily skin I feel like this is gonna be a
full coverage powder so I'm just gonna
like least at my face and I'm just gonna
do it in areas where I'm gonna apply
bronzer and stuff so just right here
right here and on the sides of my
forehead okay that takes away the
tackiness and okay I'm just gonna put it
everywhere okay so now we're gonna use
another powder that's gonna take away
this matte look Milani released two
different loose setting powders one in
the shade radiant and one labeled
transparent I don't like that one I've
mentioned it before but it has a little
bit of a sheen to it and it just looked
weird on the scanner but this one
labeled radiant is literally like a
loose highlighting powder this is
basically the loose highlighting powder
yes it literally says on the bottom of
this that it is a setting powder but I
don't I don't see it that way I'm just
gonna take a little brush like this dip
it into the cap and I'm gonna hit this
on my cheeks right here just all the
places I would normally highlight and
look how pretty that is this is so
gorgeous
it gives your skin such a beautiful
luminous sheen I apply it more product
here obviously and then I just lightly
dust my forehead I'm gonna pick up some
more
and apply it here down the nose a little
bit on the chin I just kind of feel like
that gave life back to my skin it was
looking very matte and I've honestly
just been obsessed with this I
completely forgot to mention this in my
monthly favourites video but this is
such a dupe for a Lancome powder I know
I've been saying I wanted to do a
high-end dupes video but I'm still doing
some research on that for bronzer I did
want to contour the skin a little bit
just because I have a lot going on in
the eyes so I feel like I need to
contour but I don't have a contour
powder from Milani so I'm gonna use my
Physicians Formula butter bronzer this
is the original color and I'm just gonna
contour the cheeks a little bit I'm just
gonna give some definition because the
Milani bronzer I have is very bronze II
and it doesn't really define the cheeks
it just warms up the skin I'm also gonna
apply some of this on my forehead
because mama got a 5 head you know what
I'm saying yeah and now I'm gonna bronze
up the skin I'm gonna use the baked
bronzer bronzer I sounded super Cuban
there in the shade Dulce and I'm pretty
much gonna put this all over my skin
it's a very light bronzer doesn't show
up too harshly so I feel like you can
really settle this all over the face for
blush I was gonna go in with my favorite
Milani blush in the entire world this is
the powder blush and warm petals you
guys have seen me use that about a
million times but I'm gonna go in with
the baked blush in the shade berry amore
which is a very warm like rosy nude I'm
just gonna add a little bit of date I
feel like it would compliment the eyes
really nicely oh my gosh I didn't do my
under eyes I'll do that now I also
haven't used this blush in a really long
time and now I'm like why cuz he's
gorgeous okay so for highlight I'm gonna
take this afterglow strobe light instant
glow powder apply a little bit of this
on my cheekbones on the top of my
cheekbones because I am gonna go in with
something else on top in a second but
just gonna pop a little bit of this
I really love this highlight but I want
something a little bit more golden so
I'm focusing this right here and then
I'm gonna take some on my nose but I'm
gonna take the tantastic face and body
baked bronzer and this is a bronzer I
used to use this on my body all the time
in the summer but I'm gonna take my
brush and focus it on the white part of
this you can see it has like gold and
white veining I'm just gonna dip my
brush in the very very white part
because I'm not it is too dark for me
and I'm just gonna pop a little bit of
this right there
and now to set all that down I'm gonna
use one of my favorite setting sprays in
the whole world and happens to be my
Milani they make it last setting spray
I'm running out of this
all right so now I'm gonna finish up my
lower lash line all right so I took this
purple in the matte palette and I just
buffed that on my lower lash line I
pretty much put this everywhere but I
wanted it to look oh and then I applied
some black eyeliner is the same Koko jaw
I used earlier very creamy I love that
eyeliner but I wanted it a little bit
more purple enos to my lower lash line
so I took the plum basics palette and I
applied that shimmery purple and then I
didn't have a Milani mascara so I just
went in with my L'Oreal lash paradise
okay so for lips obviously I'm gonna do
something a little bit more natural I'm
gonna take this color statement lipliner
in spice and it's a really pretty lip
liner and even though these are wooden I
really like these they do last a really
long time and I don't find them to be
too drying so that does look very dark I
know it does so we're gonna lighten it
up with a liquid lipstick this is the
amore matte lip cream in sweetie and now
we're gonna take it one step lighter
with just a little bit of this this is
like a very strange product I've only
been testing this out for about a week
now and I don't know how I feel about it
I don't know if I like it I don't know
if I dislike it but it's the keep it
full and nourishing a lip plumper it's
like a weird lip plumper I don't know
but I am gonna use it today to lighten
up this lip color so yeah that just
lightened it up a little bit and it made
it more glossy and yeah that completes
this look I know it's not something
you've never seen before I've done
similar looks on my channel but I really
love how the reddish cranberry looks
with the really deep purple I think it's
really nice and I think this look is so
glam my favourite thing is this
foundation I just feel like everything
looks really nice on the skin I feel
like if I went to an event everybody
would think I was wearing high-end
makeup there's nothing on my skin that's
like oh this is drugstore quality the
eyeshadows are a little bit more
difficult to blend they are the kind of
that do require a little bit more
blending than usual but once you blend
it out everything looks nice and smooth
and just everything about these pallets
are so luxe and I honestly think these
are one of the best at the drugstore
definitely one of the best but I did
want to tell you guys like I don't know
if these are replacing these pallet or
if they're just completely different
pallets but I did notice and be bold
obsessions palette these three shades
this black this one I used of my entire
lid and this gold are in this palette
like these three exact shades are in
this palette this is the everyday eyes
must-have metallics palette and I'm
gonna put up some swatches in a second
but this gold is the same as this gold
this cranberry and this black like they
are the same so I don't think this must
have metallics palette is worth it
because even though this is cheaper for
nine dollars more you get double the
amount of eyeshadows this has six this
has 12 and I personally think this is
better than this even though those three
shades are like the exact same formula
they're both amazing so buttery so
pigmented like this must-have metallics
palette is amazing then they came out
with this and just killed the game I
don't know why they came out with a
palette the head the exact same shades
as this but who knows I just wanted to
mention that just in case you have this
palette where you have the must-have
metallics and you know just in case I
just wanted to mention that but yes
anyway that completes this video guys I
hope you enjoyed this full face using
Milani makeup and don't forget to leave
