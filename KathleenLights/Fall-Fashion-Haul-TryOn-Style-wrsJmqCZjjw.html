a full fashion hunt a try on fashion
haul I haven't done this in a long time
on my channel so this is kind of like a
collective haul I've been shopping at
forever 21 and misguided calm usually
all my clothes is from forever 21 I've
said this like a hundred times it's
cheap and it's trendy and I really love
forever 21 but misguided calm has so
many nice clothing pieces they're just a
little bit more expensive so I rarely
shop on misguided but I did today it's
not like designer expensive but just a
little bit more pricey than forever 21
so I'm not going to go in any particular
order I literally have the stack of
clothes right here on this little table
and I'm just going to show you the
things that I picked up for fall and
winter
even though winter is not for a while
but still so the first thing I got was
from misguided and misguided on their
website I am a u.s. 4 so just in case
you're wondering this is a dress and I
really love this because it is a short
dress but it is a long sleeve dress and
it's a turtleneck as well and I can let
if I could live in turtlenecks every day
of my life I would I live in South
Florida so rarely do I ever get to wear
turtlenecks but I love them when I was
in Mississippi I will turn neck like
every day so I love it I think it's so
like simple it's very simple short and
with like really high boots like strappy
boots I think it would look really cool
or I can make it a little bit more
sporty and wear it with like combat
boots so yes I am into it this one is
also from misguided and this is one of
my favorite colors to wear because I can
do any makeup I am someone who loves to
match my clothes to my makeup I think a
lot of us do that but I hate clothes
that limit me like with a bunch of
patterns and a bunch of different colors
because then it limits my makeup does
anybody else feel that way
I love neutrals and I love solids
because I can do whatever I want on my
face so I love colors like this because
I can go any route on my face so this is
basically a crop top just a simple crop
top but it's that really pretty like
knit material
it that we call it I know it's long
sleeve I don't have any long sleeve crop
tops so I did want to get one by the way
if I can find these pieces I will link
them below of that and I'm someone who
doesn't show my stomach
you can go years and years back on all
the photos I've ever taken on my life
and unless I'm in a bikini you will not
see my stomach I don't like to show my
belly button or like my bottom stomach
so I love crop tops because I love
high-waisted things so I love wearing
like high-waisted pants and then a crop
top so you can only see like a little
piece of skin but not much so I'm
obsessed with flannel I got this shirt
at forever 21 I have like 78 flannel
shirts I didn't need another one but I
really liked it so pretty I love it
it's just a basic flannel t-shirt and I
got this one for nineteen ninety so it
was really cheap and it's like a
breathable material it's not that super
thick flannel material which is better
for me in Miami so a big trend this fall
is like faux suede and fringe like I
have been seeing it everywhere it's all
over misguided it's all over forever21
like Agassi has a bunch of it all over
their website fringe and suede is like
all the rage so a lot of my things are
either fringy and/or sweaty because it's
really trending right now so I got this
shirt at forever 21 and it is a faux
suede material and I love the color
this is the kind of color I love wearing
with my Miami fever lipstick this camel
color obsessed I like it in a shadow
form and shirt form and pant form I love
it so it's a very very very loose crop
top so it does look a little bit baggy a
little bit more chill this is a body con
so what it's called like body con suit
this is from misguided and surprised
it's another turtleneck a long-sleeve
just body con shirt I wanted a body
thing like this because sometimes when
I'm wearing a pencil skirt and I'm
wearing like a tank top or just any
regular shirt it starts to like come up
if I tuck it in
like it starts to slowly start writing
up so I wanted something that was going
to stay nice tucked and tight the whole
time so that's why I got this and this
blush color is beautiful with like Mavi
makeup looks so I was really really
bummed when I was on the misguided
website because one of my favorite
colors to wear my two all-time favorite
colors to wear are red and mustard like
that mustard color I know like
McDonald's red and whatever but so I
love those colors and when I saw this I
nearly flipped my it is a beautiful
faux suede like high-waisted shorts with
fringe super Pocahontas II but I really
loved it and it was a set it was this
and a crop top but the crop top was sold
out in my size so I wasn't gonna get the
shorts but I was not gonna let these
shorts get away from me I really wanted
these shorts so my hope is that they
will bring the crop top back in stock
because it's like a complete set and it
looks so nice but in the meantime I
could wear this with like a different
crop top like a white one or something
this is another skirt from misguided and
I got it because of the color it's
another suede item and this is what it
looks like I love it because it has that
slit I think slit in skirts are so
pretty it just gives like a nice
elegance or like a sexy vibe to the
outfit even though I don't dress like
sexy but I do like slits in my skirts
can I speak I feel like I'm struggling
anyway I think it's really really
beautiful these are pants from misguided
and I never buy pants off of website by
the way I placed like I place these
orders online misguided a forever 21 so
I never order pants online or I never
buy pants at store I rarely do because I
am really short I'm 5 2 and pants are
always long on me always my friend
Jordan tells me that I need to shop at
Topshop petite because they're made for
shorter girls and maybe I need to start
getting pants there because forever21
like everywhere I shop pants are always
too freaking long but I got these anyway
because I really liked it um these are
just regular wide leg pants
see they're really pretty like
bell-bottoms almost like wide leg pants
and I love them because there's such a
pretty holiday color I thought that
maybe I could wear this like on
Christmas Eve or something a little bit
more casual during the holidays because
it is a casual pant like the material
it's very casual as high-waisted I
really like high waisted things so I got
it anyway this is interesting this is
what are these called jumpers like a
pantsuit I don't know the term for this
but like not a romper cause rompers are
shorter correct I don't know you know
what I mean
but this is what it looks like it's just
basically completely white and it has
this giant full floppy turtleneck that
isn't like close to your neck it's just
really big and I thought it looked
really cool like very chic and different
so I wanted to get it but this is like a
million miles long since definitely for
some one who's very very tall I
definitely need to get this fixed this
way too long but I thought it would look
so beautiful with like bright red
lipstick and like my hair up in a really
tight bun I don't know I have a vision
and I thought it would look really cool
for the holidays so I got that and then
this is from forever 21 I thought this
was so cute
like the cutest little casual dress it's
just a sweater dress but it is it's
pretty short it's not like super short
to wear like your butt hangs out I don't
wear short shorts like that but it's
just like a nice short dress with little
sleeves like this and it's so pretty so
casual this will look so nice with high
um like over the knee boots and like you
have a complete outfit with just tall
boots and this really pretty like basic
sweater dress this is a fringe crop top
I got it misguided and I already wore it
and when I did wear it a lot of people
complimented me on it it's just so
pretty I love this it's very like to me
like boho and not boho last Dadar I
don't know what I don't know what word
I'm looking for but I love me some
fringe folks I love it and this shirt is
really cute it makes me look a little
bit boxy I'm not really impressed by the
way that fits on my my body type but
I feel like it's cute so this is very
different for me I'm starting to get
into this style I don't typically wear
things like this but this is a dress
from forever 21 it was only nineteen
dollars 1990 and you can't see it it
looks like I'm just holding up a black
but Apple but it's a short dress that
has bell sleeves and I never used to be
into bell sleeves and these bell sleeves
are starting to intrigue me I don't like
them on certain things but I do like
them on other certain things but anyway
it has that type of front that it I see
everywhere these days where has like
that caged front you'll see in the Tryon
and typically I'm like whoa that's a
little risque for Kathleen but I found a
way to tie them just enough like in the
right way to wear my bra doesn't show
but I really really love this I think
it's so fun and flirty and it's nice and
short and a lot these are another set of
pants and I fell in love with this color
because it's like an orange II kind of
like Miami fever a little bit for some
reason on camera it's coming off a
little bit more red but they're very
similar to the green ones I just showed
you only these are for forever 21 and
they are 1590 and they're just like this
beautiful why they're wide-leg pants
just like the other ones but these are
like that really pretty like burnt
terracotta red color really love it
around like the Thanksgiving you time
and then the last clothing piece I will
show you in today's haul is this now
this is gonna throw a bunch of you off
you're either gonna hate it or love it
and maybe most of you will hate it it's
a tuxedo dress now when I got this in
the mail I was like I'm not gonna be
able to pull this off but I just
envision me wearing this with like an
all-white outfit like a white clutch
like white shoes or something or like a
pop of color in the shoes and I just I
was so drawn to this and I think this
would look so nice like going to an
event it's like casual but classy and
different at the same time I personally
I really really like it so I got it and
I think
should wear whatever I like right I
shouldn't care what people say so those
were the clothing items I got that I
just placed an order online recently and
then a forever 21 I got to be nice I got
like this gray ish beanie
I live in beanies in November December
and January
I live it at least I did in Mississippi
I don't know about here but there a bad
hair days best friend so I got a great
one and then I got a black one really
comfortable and then I got this hat and
I got it strictly for the color it's a
beautiful and love this color for fall
it's a beautiful like burgundy oxblood
is that the color that a lot of people
refer this to I feel like because of the
cut on this hat that it makes me look
like Ranger Joe or something like a
forest ranger I don't know I always feel
really silly in hats like if people are
staring at me like in hats don't look
good on you but I love hats
I love hat so much so I'm starting to
get comfortable and and wearing them
more often because I really love them
and I shouldn't really care but I really
love the color and then to finish off
this haul I just bought two pairs of
shoes and surprisingly they're both a
faux suede material I got these at
forever 21 and they were so inexpensive
they're that faux suede like I said and
I love pointed shoes I don't like
rounded shoes anymore all of my flats
are all pointed now but I just love them
I feel like they give a little bit of
something extra to your outfit and these
are such a pretty red it's not like a
bright red it's a pretty holiday red so
I think I'm gonna get a lot of use out
of these like in the upcoming months and
they're pretty good quality I mean
they're very inexpensive because they're
forever21 brand I'm not gonna say
they're gonna last years but I mean
they're cheap and they're really cute I
like them and then I got a pair of Steve
Madden shoes I love the color I love
this like mustard a yellow color so
these are the shoes they're also that
faux suede material but look how
stunning I think they're beautiful and
they're perfect for like every day if
you want to wear heels because the heel
is really really chunky so it makes it
very casual it's
very casual he'll perfect with jeans
shorts skirts
it's that shoe that looks good with any
style I thought they were so so
beautiful and the color makes them
really unique to me okay so that was
everything I got I just wanted to pick
up a few pieces that I wanted to wear in
the fall time and then transitioning
into winter I live in Miami so there's
no winter so yeah that is just a little
bit of a look into my style I never do
style videos but I've already told you
guys that I wanted to incorporate
fashion more on my channel so that is
what I'm doing for you here I hope you
