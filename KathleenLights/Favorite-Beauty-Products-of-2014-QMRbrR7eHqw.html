it means that you guys really wanted to
see this today's video is going to be my
yearly favourites I've never done this
video before these are those products
that I loved throughout the year of 2014
things that I discovered this year or
last year technically because it's
already January first things that I
discovered in 2014 that really stuck out
to me and that I used constantly just
things that I really loved in 2014 I
just found my December favorites like
three hours ago and then I was like oh I
have you have to go film that video so
I'm here filming this okay huge warning
this video may be very long because I
have a lot of stuff to talk about but I
meant try to skim through them as fast
as I can I mean it's a yearly favourites
my monthly favourites are 20 minutes
long imagine I'm going to start off with
eyeshadow palettes I have a ton of
eyeshadow palettes it's like my weakness
I love buying new palettes and trying
them out and doing tutorials and reviews
for you guys so I tried out many many
eyeshadow palettes this year and these
three were my ultimate favorite I love
the Urban Decay Naked palette I didn't
discover it this year but it is still
another favorite that I used a ton in
2014 but my number one best discovery
ever is the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette I have spoken about this palette
probably too much at this point it's my
favorite palette of all time it smells
delicious and all the colors are amazing
I love the colors in this palette I love
that there's two highlight shades that
are really big and ones matte and when a
shimmery and I love that there's a bunch
of different matte Browns light Browns
dark Browns Gold's pinks I love
everything about this palette definitely
my best palette discovery in 2014 it was
a little bit later in the year that I
discovered this but I still have used it
constantly I don't have the semi-sweet
chocolate bar palette I bought it and
then I returned it because I don't think
it's as good as this one and I didn't
want a palette that I was never going to
reach for so um I just want to say that
two-faced as a brand
didn't really use two-faced before this
before 2014 not much but I have grown to
love Too Faced out of all the higher end
brands like that's the first place I go
for at Sephora it's my all-time favorite
high-end brand Too Faced is wonderful I
have purchased all my Too Faced products
and they're all fantastic I love it's my
favorite high-end brand that's one thing
I discovered in 2014 is that Too Faced
is my favorite another palette that I
discovered really early on in this year
and I used so much I haven't used it
recently because it's like fall and
winter and it's very summery but it is
the Urban Decay electric palette I
didn't think I was going to use this
palette as much as I did it's wonderful
has a big mirror and I believe you can
still get it I believe I think I saw it
at my Sephora like last month I think I
thought it was emitted edition but I
honestly don't think it is anymore if it
is oh my god I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
even mentioning this but I love it I
have used a lot of colorful eyeshadows
but these are the best this palette is
just so good I use it all the time for a
pop of color like if I'm doing a look
like this and I want to put like a lime
green on the lower lash line I'll just
grab this palette I grab it so much more
than I thought I would because it's not
very wearable but I love it and I love
the packaging it's just a great palette
and then another favorite of mine I
don't even mention on my channel all
that much but it's one of my all-time
favorite palettes like top 5 and it is
the it cosmetics naturally pretty
palette this is the original palette I
discovered this pretty early on in the
year as well and it's my favorite matte
palette ever it's so good it's nothing
but my eyeshadows except this one this
is the transforming pearl shadow and
it's like a little bit shimmery mocha is
my favorite eyeshadow in this palette I
love it you have warm shades cool tone
shades blues and purples and it's just
really versatile it's that palette that
I grab a lot when I'm not filming and I
just want a simple like matte crease
kind of look I grab this a lot I love
this palette I will link a tutorial or
two down below using this and I will
actually I will link tutorials where I
use the electric palette and I will link
the tutorials where I used the Cosmetics
one of them is super dark iPhone the
tutorial and it's really dark but I only
get anyway I do want to give a quick
mention to makeup geek eyeshadows
because I use them a ton in 2013 I did
purchase some pigments and a couple
eyeshadows on my own and I really loved
them and then this year it was really
special because I got to talk to Marlena
like she emailed me herself and told me
that she was so proud of like my channel
and that she really thanks me for
supporting makeup geek and it just meant
so much to me that she reached out to me
herself and you know said thank you and
she's such a great woman like a great
wonderful person a great businesswoman
as well so I definitely recommend makeup
geek eyeshadows not only because she's
great but because the quality of the
products are good after using makeup
geek eyeshadows I don't I won't buy mac
eyeshadow anymore so that's a big thing
that happened in 2014 because before
makeup geek I was like buying Mac
eyeshadows all the time I loved Mac
eyeshadows until I was introduced to
this because these are so much cheaper
and they're better actually they're
better okay let's move on oh my god I
feel like this videos already long is it
oh my god I want to talk about - um
lipsticks from the drugstore that I
loved just a brand in general these are
the Wet n Wild mega lass lipsticks I
have a whole video swatching a bunch of
them I will link it down below
lots of linking will be happening in
this video I will link that video down
below it's really old it's like one of
my older videos one of my first videos
but I love these wet and wild lipsticks
I discovered them this year last year I
discovered them in 2014 or like at the
end of 2013 I love them so much I use
them a ton in 2014 they're great they're
like two dollars and the packaging sucks
this packaging is not very good but
what's important is the quality they
don't have a scent and they're matte and
they're amazing and they last all day on
the lips and just for a couple dollars
you can't beat that
this one is bear at all and this is my
favorite nude from the drugstore so I
really really like this
and I also loved the Milani lipsticks
the ones in the gold packaging like this
they're great they're one of the best
drugstore lipsticks out there and they
smell like watermelon Jolly Ranchers
they're really really good and I really
love this one this in is nude cream it's
the perfect everyday pink nude ish pink
it's really nice and these are really
good - they're very creamy and they're
not like matte or anything but they're
super creamy and they last a pretty good
time those are these - I love them for
the drugstore I highly recommend these
two lines if it when it comes to drugs
drugstore can I speak but but but um
2014 thanks to my friend Nicole I
discovered the best lipstick in the
entire world if somebody would have told
me like six months ago that I was going
to love a lipstick more than my MAC
lipsticks I would have been like oh are
you off your medication I have a bunch
of MAC lipsticks they're my favorite
high-end lipsticks but I found something
that's a lot more expensive but they are
so good they are better than MAC
lipsticks and they are the NARS
audacious lipsticks these are not super
recent discoveries it's been a few
months but I did start loving them at
the end of the year but I really love
these two the most this is racquel which
is my favorite lipstick of all time out
of all my lipsticks in the history of
life this is my favorite one and then I
really like this one this is this one is
Jane it's like a terracotta kind of nude
it's really pretty has a good warm
undertone I really love these two the
formula of the NARS audacious lipsticks
can't be beat they're creamy but they're
like a satin finish
they last a really long time they smell
like nothing it doesn't have a repulsing
scent and they're perfect the formula is
perfect they they killed it like really
did I'm gonna say it that's expensive
but that's worth it okay so I'm not a
lipgloss person I have a few actually I
have like a lot of lip glosses for
someone who doesn't like lip gloss all
that much but sometimes I do love that
glossy finish like there's some looks
that I just need a gloss with you know
and I discover
at my favorite lip glosses ever and they
are the buxom lip glosses these are the
full-on lip creams from buxom this this
one is a recent purchase like I just
recently bought this but the buxom
lipgloss in White Russian is my all-time
favorite lip gloss in the history of the
world discovered it in 2014 no lip gloss
will ever compare it's like a creamy
milky pink color and I love it I hate
sticky lip glosses and these are sticky
but like in a nice sticky not like a
goopy kind of sticky bit it grosses me
out
it's sticky but because it's sticky how
many times can I say because it is
sticky it lasts forever on my lips I put
this lip gloss on and it lasts all day
and it has like a minty sensation like a
tingling sensation I don't know if it's
supposed to be lip plumping I don't
think so but it doesn't pull my lips
doesn't hurt doesn't do anything but it
gives a really nice tingling sensation
to my lips and it's like cold and it's
amazing and they smell really really
nice like a minty little frosting I
don't know I really love them best lip
glosses I've ever come across
so another Too Faced product that has
become holy grill that I discovered is
the Too Faced perfect lips lip liner
this is the only one I have but I want
out there's four I want all four of them
because these are the best well this is
the best lip liner I have ever used
super high-end low-end this is the best
not only for the color this is in
perfect new don't know if it's or that
not only for the color but for the
staying power I wear this every time I'm
going to go to dinner because this lasts
forever and I'm eating like a steak a
juicy steak and this won't slip and
slide anywhere it's like cement did I
spit probably a brand that I discovered
in 2014
that's so inexpensive and that I love
dearly is la girl and they also do la
colors and I have a couple of LA Colors
products that actually really like but
these two were the standout products for
me in 2014 these are the pro conceal HD
concealers these are amazing
three dollar concealers or four dollars
and they are so comparable to the mac
prolongwear concealer their full
coverage yet they're not cakey
underneath the eyes packaging kind of
sucks because you really have to squeeze
the tubes to get stuff out but these are
amazing even if you are not on a budget
I highly recommend these but if you are
these are going to be your best friend
they're fantastic they're all so nice to
cover blemishes it's an all-around
amazing concealer and I love the LA girl
glide gel liners these are just like
eyeliners but they're called gel liners
they feel like gel
they're so good they're so creamy and
they stay on the waterline for a really
long time because they are so pigmented
I highly recommend these these are just
a couple of dollars and they're nice
they're really nice you can find le
girls at drugstore comm they're
seriously the best eyeliners I have
found this year or last year and they're
so cheap another great thing that I'm so
happy I discovered our elf baked
products this was the year of elf for me
I did a lot of elf research and I you
know I bought a lot of elf makeup to
test out for you guys and I loved their
baked product specifically they're baked
highlighters I think they're baked eye
liners are so underrated and I don't
know why this is a baked blush blush
this is a baked blush actually in pink
tastic but I use it as I highlight why
am I talking weird it's such a pretty
highlight so comparable to like high-end
products in my opinion if you haven't
tried their big tie letters do so
especially their baked blush in pink
tastic so I had two blushes blow me away
this year 2014 last year this is the
blush and honeymoon I have mentioned
this a couple of times is from makeup
geek I love this blush it's one of my
all-time favorite blushes and it just
I've I love it so much I love this blush
definitely my favorite makeup eat blush
alongside of spellbound these two
blushes are incredible it was just a
little bit darker but they're so nice if
you have fair skin I really like this
one even though it does have like little
glitters in it it doesn't really
transfer it just makes your cheeks look
nice and glowy makeup geek
were another really big thing in 2014
they came out with them in 2014 and they
are fantastic this is a recent love of
mine but it has become my all-time
favorite and it became my favorite in
2014 this is NARS madly blush this is
the best blush I have ever purchased in
my life it goes with every single makeup
look it even looks pretty with no
bronzer just blah if you haven't even if
you didn't so good
I mean swatched it's not even that cute
like when you swatch it you're like oh
so yeah but on your face on your face
another really really impressive
products for me this is the cindy lou
manizer by the brand the balm I use the
crap out of this aw summer it's my
favorite glowy blush in the history of
the world this is like a highlighter for
darker skin tones but for for hate that
it's a friggin f for like this is
definitely a highlighter for like deeper
skin tones but for like light medium to
light light skin this is a perfect blush
if you want a very glowy blush it's
beautiful I love it I definitely pull it
out constantly in the spring and summer
because it has like a peachy glow to it
highly recommend the bombs umm Luminizer
's I discovered them in 2014 and I loved
them so I found a Holy Grail primer this
is the best primer I have ever used and
it's another two-faced product this is
the Too Faced hangover RX replenishing
face primer I love this this is the best
primer I have ever tried this is a
silicone free primer which is not what a
lot of people go forward but I love
silicone primer I like them because they
cover your pores really well but I have
really sensitive skin and I feel like if
I use too much of silicone on my skin it
clogs my pores so I love this because
it's great for a sensitive skin because
it is silicone free and it's so
moisturizing it feels like I'm putting
on a moisturizer on my skin but then it
immediately absorbs into the skin so I
think that maybe even oily skin would
really like this this is a
with coconut water electrolytes and
probiotic I just feel like it wakes up
my skin it makes foundation go on so
much nicer
okay so 2014 was the year of foundations
where I really branched out for a long
time all I ever used was Revlon
Colorstay for a long time but I
discovered two foundations that are so
good they're definitely my favorites top
3 says Revlon Colorstay is in my top 3
but these other two are the best
foundations I have ever used one is more
drugstore price this is the Bourjois
healthy mix serum I spoke about this in
my December favorites so I'm not going
to go on and on about it but I love it
it's very dewy very fresh it's a light
coverage but you can build it up and
then this is the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation I do love this one more than
this because this is my like reliable
foundation whenever I wore this on New
Year's Eve I wore this on Christmas Eve
I wore this on my anniversary
I wear this woman when I know I'm gonna
be taking pictures this is that
foundation that I could always depend on
it has amazing coverage
it's like medium but buildable to full
coverage it has no SPF so you don't get
a white cast in photos it looks flawless
on the skin if my skin is super super
dry I feel like it clings on to a couple
of dry patches but that's nothing a
little bit of hangover can't fix okay so
umm 2014 was the year that I discovered
false lashes I never wore false lashes
when I started my channel every single
tutorial only had mascara and you guys
know I do a lot of tutorials and I only
wear mascara and a lot of them just
because I don't think that every single
look needs falsies but I really fell in
love with false lashes in 2014
specifically a certain brand the these
are House of lashes falsies I love them
I just I love them so much they're on
the pricier side because these are about
eight dollars a pair when ardell lashes
are about three or four dollars and
these are great I love ardell lashes but
I find that house of
Asha's lasts longer I can reuse them so
many times even though I reuse my Ardell
ones I could reuse house of lashes so
many times and you guys know if you
watch my channel that I'm not a fan of
the lower lashes
everybody loves the Lord they do and I'm
sure and they're great but I bought pair
myself they cost me $30 and I wore them
three times and I feel like they're
already I'm ready to throw them away
because they're so fragile they like
fell apart these are sturdy really nice
um a little bit difficult to apply at
first these are in sweet romance these
are the first pair I ever bought because
they're super natural these are really
nice natural lashes and sweet romance
but these two have to be like my
all-time favorites this is in the in the
style Bambi they're like I don't know
they're really kind of like spidery
looking but in a nice way I really love
these and then this one Nicole gave
these to me
these are Pixy lux and I love them
they're like super like wispy and like
oh my dear they're so pretty lo so much
the band is a lot thicker on this one
then on the other ones but I feel like I
don't know I just rent nothing so pretty
and the House of lashes and I love the
new bit this is the house of lashes
eyelash adhesive and clear I just
purchased a new one it says smells like
flowers I don't agree but it doesn't
smell as bad as doooo doooo smells like
fish farts it smells bad but this one
smells like actually nice not like
flowers but nice I just purchased a new
one can't wait to use this it's a brand
new bottle I've purchased all House of
lashes myself love the eyelash glue too
that's a major discovery of - year as
well or last year oh I'm gonna be
writing 2014 on papers for like the next
six months is the Jessie's Girl liquid
eyeliner before this eyeliner I swore by
the Maybelline master precise liquid
eyeliner and I like this one a lot more
that ones a felt-tip this one's a brush
I still love that
one but this is the best liquid eyeliner
ever because well when it comes to a pen
form because I think of the NYC liquid
eyeliner is the best there is and it's
like two dollars that's the best liquid
eyeliner ever in the world but when it
comes to a pen this is the best and I
feel like pens like pen liquid eyeliners
are so much easier to apply than the
ones with the brush but it's just so
easy to apply it's kind of foolproof I
love it so much it lasts a really long
time and it's like six dollars I get it
at Jessie's Girl duck Jessie's Girl
cosmetics calm I pretty sure it's where
I bought it okay so two more things I
completely fell in love with the new
mascara this year last year and it's
crazy because I have been using my
Clinique lash doubling ask era since I
was fifteen years old and that is my
all-time favorite mascara I still love
that one more than this one just because
it hits close to home and I've loved it
for so many years but this is the best
mascara I've ever used and I discovered
it in 2014 this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara this is the weirdest
name so weird okay
so weird this is the best mascara in the
world if you like voluminous lashes like
wool girl there was some voluminous
lashes this is your guy I love it I love
it it's a higher-end brand so it's
pretty pricey but it's more expensive
than my Clinique one but it's so worth
it because it makes my eyelashes like
wooo so nice and it's a fiber bristle
wand No yes which I prefer I don't like
the plastic ones all that much okay last
thing colour-pop was um something I
discovered in 2014 that I loved dearly
I discovered it more towards the end of
the year but still I really really love
them they have $5 eyeshadows and $5 lip
sticks so affordable I will link the
colour-pop website down below they don't
ship internationally but word on the
street is that they will start shipping
internationally soon these are my
favorite eyeshadow from colour-pop
these three they're fantastic this is
this distance isn't this one is in
sequin it's a beautiful like pinky rose
gold Goldy yeah it's beautiful
this one's game face
it's like an orange copper right up my
alley I love it and then this one is
smash this one is like a very beautiful
muted tan color with like gold
undertones it's really nice um and I
really really like these they're amazing
and they're lippie stix are the bomb.com
I think I like their Libby sticks a
little bit more than their lip than
their eyeshadows just a little bit more
um and these two are my favorite ones
this one is Lumiere this is the one that
I created with colour-pop he reached out
to me and asked me if I wanted to do a
lipstick with them I created the color
the finish the name and I I was just so
blown away that they asked me so I was a
major Beauty favorite of mine in 2014
was creating this lipstick it's
something that means a lot to me and I
love it so much I will link it down
below yeah I love it and besides that
clique is definitely my favorite lippy
that they have it's a matte finish and
it's a reddish orange color it's very
red but it has like the orange
undertones oh my gosh this looks so
beautiful with a tan it looks like
beautiful embarrassed
I love clique it's amazing I love this
color okay guys so that completes this
video these are products that I've tried
in 2014 that really stood out to me and
that I love dearly and that I will
continue to use it was a big like makeup
year for me because this is the year
that my channel kind of like took off I
started my channel in 2013 and I feel
like 2014 it really got people started
to subscribe a lot more in 2014 and I'm
I try to post videos as much as I can
even when I'm sick I just I feel the
need to post I post three times a week
