my 2015 beauty favorites please excuse
the echo I know there is a huge echo in
this room I still haven't finished
setting up I still have to put a ton of
things on the walls to kind of like
capture the echo so that there isn't an
echo I already put a rug but that didn't
help by the way 18 T's at my house right
now so if you hear people talking it's a
dandy this is not my setup this is not
the background you are going to be
seeing from now on as you guys know I
did just move into a new home and this
is not going to be my setup this is just
the prettiest part of the room right now
because my room is a disaster I'm still
putting away a ton of makeup I'm still
organizing and I really just wanted to
get this video up so I just quickly
turned on the camera and I decided to
film it right now so today I'm going to
be talking about the products that blew
my mind in 2015 I'm not gonna do
specific categories like I'm not gonna
do primary foundation blush bronzer
highlight eyeshadow I'm not gonna do
specific categories because for example
NAR is madly blush I spoke about it in
my 2014 favorites and it's still my
all-time favorite blush like to me
nothing has beat madly from NARS and
nothing has come close to it so I've
still been loving it this year but it's
not necessarily something I discovered
or started loving this year so these are
basically products that I either
discovered this year started loving goal
not this year 2015
or they released in the past year let's
jump into it I discovered the best
primer I have ever used in my entire
life when it comes to eyeshadow and it
is the Mac prep and prime 24 hour
extended eye base I really don't know
what I was priming my eyelids with
before this that's a little bit dramatic
because I still love Mac painterly
paint-pot and there's a bunch of other
primers that I still really like but
nothing compares to this especially with
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows these make
your makeup geek foiled eyeshadows just
stick to your lid and they don't
transfer to the top because sometimes
because they're so creamy they can
transfer to the top of your lid this
keeps your foil eyeshadows in place and
it's also really great
with color pop eyeshadows it's just the
best best primer my eyeshadow lasts the
entire day and it's still extremely
vibrant at the end of the day I'm gonna
try to go through these products really
really quickly I'm not gonna swatch
anything either because we will be here
for four hours but I already know this
video is gonna be 45 minutes long
because my monthly favourites videos are
25 minutes long so I wouldn't know okay
so I sat down and thought about which
eyeshadow palette I used the most in
this past year and it has to be my zoeva
cocoa blend palette this is the one that
impressed me the most out of all of the
palettes that I got last year I will say
the Too Faced bonbon palette might be my
favorite palette this year and this year
just started I used this palette the
most out of all the other palettes I
have I just love every single shade
there isn't one shade in this palette
that I don't like at all I have used
literally all of them and the best thing
about this palette is that it has my
ideal gold like this is the best gold
eyeshadow I have ever used in my life
it's in this palette and I love gold
they're just really really creamy really
really buttery and smooth they blend
like a dream and it's just so sleek and
just so easy to travel with this palette
is amazing and I don't think it gets the
hype it deserves because it's fabulous
okay
still sticking with eyeshadows I have to
give a quick mention to the makeup geek
foiled eyeshadows because out of all of
the single eyeshadows that released in
2015 the foiled shadows by makeup geek
blew me a freaking way this is actually
a palette full of like random random
eyeshadows but I have a lot of the
foiled ones in here and you can just
tell which one a makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow is because it has the
prettiest like shimi texture it's
freaking amazing if you haven't tried
the foiled shadows they're the most
pigmented most creamiest texture do have
to use a really good primer because they
will crease but I will say that my top
baby out of all of the makeup geek
foiled eyeshadows it has to be
grandstand it's a really pretty topi
Mavi I don't know it's amazing so
Marlena you did a fabulous job on the
foiled eyeshadows and I just had to give
them a shout-out okay so if I had to
talk about a single eyeshadow that I
used the most this past year
to be my Bobby Brown camel eyeshadow I
use this eyeshadow in the crease of 90%
of my looks this is in my everyday
makeup bag and I always always always
grab this and throw this in my crease if
I'm using warmer colors like if I'm
doing a brown smokey eye or a gold
smokey eye which is usually the colors I
go for Bobby Brown's camel is without a
doubt gonna be in there I don't know how
I haven't hit pan I use this like a
madwoman because my hair is a mess it's
honestly the best it's like a poopy it's
like a poopy olive yellow vomit color
but it's stunning in the crease it's
really really amazing and then I have to
give a shout out to my NARS these old
eyes shadow duo because this is another
product that I used non-stop throughout
the entire year I also don't know how I
haven't hit pan on this when I don't
know what I'm gonna do like if I don't
know what I shout out to do I will throw
camel in the crease and then I will
apply these two eyeshadows on my eyes
and every time I use that combination
somebody asks me what's on my eyes these
are definitely my favorite eye shadows
NARS has made ever it's amazing you need
this duo if you're into warm colors but
for me when it comes to mascara I love a
natural like bristle brush I don't like
rubber rubber brushes at all but my two
favorite mascaras of the year are like
rubber rubber brushes L'Oreal telescopic
carbon black has been hands-down my
favorite at the drugstore it might be my
favorite ever at the drugstore do I love
one more than this I don't think so this
has become my favorite drugstore mascara
it's amazing it gives me ton of length
and a ton of volume it's a mascara I'm
wearing on my lashes right now although
you probably can't tell to me it's the
perfect formula and it has such a tiny
wand that it does both your top lashes
and your bottom lashes beautifully is
the glue down low B and then I do have
to give a mention to the benefit roller
lash which is another you know rubber
one it's very similar to the L'Oreal
telescopic now that I think about it but
this one keeps my curl a little bit more
than the L'Oreal one does but I still
love them both equally benefit roller
lash I have been using it all frickin
year if you've been watching my channel
for a while you're probably not
surprised to see this in two
video these are eyeliners from NYX and
these are the choice only I can't speak
French the gel pencil liners I have mine
in brown and pitch black these are the
best freakin eyeliners I have ever used
in my entire life and that's high-end
drugstore these next ones are the best
and everybody has different eyes and
everybody's eyes water differently and
water lines and it's always really
tricky but for me these stay put the
entire day they go on my waterline
really creamy they don't hurt at all and
it doesn't dry too quickly but once it
sets it sets actually have the brown one
like on my lower lash line right now
Thank You NYX thank you because I love
you and I love these okay so I'm gonna
throw brows into the eyes category cuz
they're really close to the eyes and I
feel like the drugstore did it this past
year they have amazing brow product so I
really was a huge fan of the NYX brow
what is it called NYX micro brow pencil
it is pretty much the exact same as the
Anastasio one I have mine in brunette
and I'm wearing it on my eyebrows right
now and it lasts all day I really really
love this but what did it for me this
past year was this bad boy I never
thought I would love a product as much
as I loved this this is the L'Oreal uh
what is it's called brow stylist plumper
the name rubbed off on this because I
use it that much
this sets my eyebrows like nothing ever
has it has like tiny little fibers in it
kind of reminds me of the benefit gimme
brow but thirty million times better so
those little fibers make your eyebrows
look a little bit thicker and they just
set them in place like glue your
eyebrows don't move people
okay so face products unfortunately I
feel like the drugstore didn't
completely win my heart over in the face
category for eyes and brows the
drugstore was in it but for me Holy
Grail products for face unfortunately
was high-end but I thought I would share
them with you anyway because I can't lie
to you guys I never lied to you guys I
got to show you my favorites so in 2015
I discovered the best foundation of my
entire life and it is the make up
forever face and body foundation they
stopped selling this in Sephora which
made me think that it was being
discontinued so I bought some backups on
the Sephora website but it's still being
sold on the website so I don't know what
the deal is but if they just continue
this like if all my foundations suddenly
disappeared and I was only able to keep
one it would be the face and body this
leaves my face flawless without looking
cakey I can put like 37 layers of this
on my face and it does not look cakey I
wore this to fame Expo and a ton of you
guys were like wow your makeup looks
really good like your face doesn't look
leaky whatsoever and it's because of
this I wear this every time I'm going to
go out every time I'm going to have an
event where I'm being like where my
photo is being taken this looks amazing
and photography it's very very liquidy
it's I would say its sheer - buildable
coverage because I can throw on like
four layers of this and I have like
almost full coverage it's pretty insane
but one little layer of this gives you
like sheer but beautiful coverage my
favorite way to apply this is with a
flat top kabuki and I have to like Pat
it in it takes a little bit longer
because I do have to take my time with
it so that I can get the best coverage
but it's amazing I highly recommend this
I don't recommend using this with a
Beauty Blender because this is like 50%
or like 80% water so this will just like
soak up in your Beauty Blender but it's
the best foundation by the way this is
the morphe ecigs brush and it's really
good I know that this is like in
everyone's yearly favorites but they
lion people day in Lion the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer hands-down the best
concealer I've tried this past year I
even gave away my mac pro longwear
concealer zas
discovering this this is literally mac
prolongwear with a fabulous freakin
applicator because every time I try to
put on mac prolongwear even though it
was my favorite concealer it was such a
mission you know was really hard to pump
out and then too much would come on
and it's yes so this is basically mac
prolongwear with a better packaging
better application this does increase on
me if I set it right away and it just
looks flawless it has really great
coverage and just makes my under eyes
look really nice I'm wearing it right
now underneath my eyes the only thing
that sucks is the color selection I
literally had to buy three because I
could not find my color so ever decay
fix the color selection alright so
contouring was all the rage in 2015
along with highlighting I feel like
contouring highlighting was a major a
major thing in 2015 and out of all the
contour and Apetit of what the hail is
dead what's happening and out of all the
contouring kits I tried the Too Faced
cocoa contour kit hands down is the best
one I used mine is shattered which is
scaring me a little bit this is what it
looks like on the inside what in the
world I'm about to get really angry I'm
pretty sure AT&amp;amp;T is like freaking with
my electricity but let's move on this is
what it looks like on the inside I've
already hit pan like major pan on the
light cocoa shade it's my favorite color
in this little quad here it has medium
cocoa and dark cocoa this is for me the
best contouring shade ever it has like
the perfect amount of coolness but not
like ashy or gray where it looks really
weird on your face it's the perfect
contour shade and then dark cocoa is
such a nice warm bronzer that you can
kind of mix with this and it's just
delicious I love like cocoa to put
underneath my eyes to really brighten up
my under-eye because it's such a
beautiful like really bright vanilla
shade the only shade that is really
awful and this is pop of light I don't
even use this because it's awful pop of
light sucks
I do want to talk about a different
bronzer though because out of all that
like single bronzers
in 2015 this one was my all-time
favorite this is the girl lactic bronzer
in the shade Cabo this is the bronzer I
have on my face today I used it to
contour and to just like warm up my skin
this is really similar to medium cocoa
in the sense that it's the perfect
neutral bronzer it has a little bit of
warmth and a little bit of a shiness to
it so it makes like the perfect shade
it's great for warming up the skin and
contouring at the same time and it's
also amazing because it's really really
really pigmented that you only need just
a little bit and you look great I love
it I loved a lot of bronzers this year
right okay I have to talk about this
because I'm pretty sure I got it at the
end of 2014 but 2015 is where I really
use this bad boy this is the Charlotte
Tilbury film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow this is
such a pricey product but it is amazing
I've never had a product that has like
two products in it where I love both
equally this is amazing the formula is
so buttery and smooth and perfect I love
it
and this highlight shade is beautiful
too I think that this is my favorite
makeup item in my entire collection like
my one makeup item this is my favorite I
want to give a shout out to the fit me
powder in the shade 135 creamy natural
because this is what I use to set my
under eye concealer most of the time
because it's such a finely milled powder
like so fine so beautiful it's not cakey
at all but it has like a light
iridescent to it that it really
brightens your under eyes this powder is
amazing I haven't been able to find it
in the stores anymore like in Walgreens
so I've had to buy a backup on Amazon
but 135 creamy natural you-you'd a bomb
Yuda bomb the face primer I use non-stop
this past year was the Laura Mercier
foundation primer in radiance I'm almost
out of this like it's almost empty out
of all the glowy primers I have this one
is my favorite because it almost feels
like a moisturizer as well I don't feel
like I'm just putting on a liquid
highlight you know I feel like I'm
putting on a really really radiant
moisturizer and it makes my makeup stick
to it it's just
really beautiful especially for those of
you who have dry skin it's fantastic I
love it
another primer that I used non-stop was
the Make Up For Ever step one skin
equalizer in smoothing I love most of
these like I love the hydrating run and
the radiance one but this one and
smoothing was the one that I used
non-stop I love using this in
combination with my makeup for ever face
and body it's like the perfect
combination I love this this really does
a great job of filling in my pores so
well but it doesn't dry out my skin the
benefit Porefessional balls up on my
skin the Smashbox pore minimize oh that
one is horrible on my dry skin this one
is the only one that works really well
with my dry skin I love it if you have
poor issues this is for you okay so I
only have to face highlights to share
with you guys I loved a ton in 2015 but
I narrowed it down to my two favorites
of the year I used Becca's champagne pop
a lot in 2015 this is the one that
Jacqueline Hill created in collaboration
with Becca it is amazing and I'm not
just saying that because I really do
love Jacqueline I really do love this
product it's so crazy how someone can be
wearing this and I know it's champagne
pop like I will look at them be like hey
girl you wearing champagne pop I've done
that to a few people and they're like oh
my god yes I am
I find this product so unique I don't
know what it is about it but I think
like the peach eNOS with the gold makes
it really unique and it's stunning and
it's beautiful and really really really
intense on the face I love it and I used
it so much this past year the only thing
I don't like is that Beca highlights are
like prone to my dreadlocks are at it
again Beca highlights are like extremely
prone to breakage
what's up will dang you know okay so the
next highlight I have to talk about is
the one I'm wearing on my face right now
it is my all-time favorite highlight if
all my highlights had to disappear and
that's saying a lot but if all of them
had to disappear and I could only keep
one it would be my Laura Mercier
highlight in the shade zero one it is
technically called their matte radiance
baked powder in the shade is 0-1 it's
not matte I mean obviously I love it so
much this is what it looks like this is
the one that
with me to travel because I feel like
it's really sturdy and like because it's
baked I don't know it travels really
well this is the most beautiful
highlight and not because of the color
which these are the colors I tend to go
for like the pearly shades the ones that
look more like white on the skin but
because it's the best texture out there
if you have like mature skin or if you
have a lot of acne or a lot of bumps on
your cheeks and you notice like wow
every time I highlight my face my acne
is like hella visible or like my bump so
it's really really prominent I feel like
this doesn't do that because of its
matte texture it's not a glittery or
like metallic it just gives a natural
Sheen if you have problematic skin and
you still want to highlight I would
definitely recommend checking this out
and the last face product I have to give
a shout out to is my tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist I know that there's a lot
of like you either hate this or love
this I personally love this for my skin
type I have a very dry skin so dry that
sometimes I like it crusts around my
nose and in between my eyebrows like it
flakes off like my skin peels from the
dryness it's disgusting
I know but every time I spray this on my
face before I go in with because that's
what I usually do I spray it on my
entire face and then I prime and then I
apply my foundation this makes my
foundation just glide on I don't have
problem with dry patches
I can even wear matte foundations thanks
to the tatcha luminous dewy skin mists
and it's hella pricey I purchased this
and I do not regret it it is a super dry
girl's best friend okay so for the lips
category I really really really tried to
narrow it down you guys know I feel like
everybody has been saying this but 2015
was also the year of liquid lipsticks
like they blew up this past year and I
have my ultimate favorite ones if you
saw my liquid lipstick video where I
talked about all the ones I own they're
actually right here plus my liquid
lipsticks right there I talked about all
the ones that I own and the three best
brands I discovered are the dose of
colors liquid lipsticks the ofra long
lasting liquid lipsticks and girl lactic
liquid lipsticks those three hands-down
the best formula
I've ever tried and I don't want to go
into detail like I haven't that's why I
didn't talk about like my color pop
eyeshadows I created in my eyes category
because I don't want this to seem like a
self-promotion type of thing so I'm not
going to talk about Havana nights or
Miami fever or anything like that but
besides those two the 204 liquid
lipsticks that I wore the most were
these guys right here and it is South
Paulo and Rio I also used Pasadena a lot
too but these two I use the most in the
summer Rio was all I use this is a
really beautiful peachy liquid lipstick
that doesn't get disgusting and crusty
on the inner fantastic and the same goes
with Sal Paulo I love it it's a really
pretty nude but it's a little bit peachy
err like it's a warmer nude and I used
it non so this looks beautiful with like
an intense smoky eye I love the over
liquid lipsticks out of all of the dose
of colors liquid lipsticks I own and I
have purchased every single one of mine
and I have almost all of them except
like two of them this is the best one
hands down I know you guys were probably
thinking I was going to talk about the
stone but no I love sand the most and it
is the weirdest shade ever it is it
literally is the color of sand like
think of sand on a beach that's what
this looks like it is a really really
pale nude but it's not like Mac myth or
it looks really peachy and it makes like
your lips look dead it is kind of like a
light beige brown nude I don't know it's
so weird but it's really really really
really light but the reason why this
blew me away was because this is the
only super pale nude shade that doesn't
crust up on the inner on the inner part
of my mouth and then out of all I love
all the girl acting liquid lip paints or
what are they go yeah lip paints matte
lip paints they're all amazing but the
ones that I used the most this past year
was the shade divine which was formerly
known as Damir it used to be called
demure and then she changed it to divine
and then she
named another one Tamir it's really
really confusing I just love the color
and it goes with so many things divine
you my bestie and then I have two lip
products to mention that are not liquid
lipsticks surprisingly enough this is
the Maybelline is this creamy matte
lipstick in the shade craving coral
amazing the I have this one to show you
but I just want to talk about these in
general out of all of the lipsticks at
the drugstore this is by far my favorite
formula that any brand has ever created
they are matte but they are the most
creamiest the most comfortable matte you
will ever come across in your entire
freaking life it's fabulous the best
maybelline creamy matte lipsticks
amazing out of all the lip liners I own
I used this one the most this is the Mac
Pro Longwear lip pencil in the shade etc
- all beat up because I used this
non-stop I saw my friend Gabby Gabby TMU
a here on YouTube I saw her using it in
a tutorial when I was like I need that
lip liner like it I had a moment and I
needed the lip liner I purchased it and
it's my favorite Mac lip liner and I
don't hear anyone talking about it
except Gabby Mac etc lip liner it's a
really pretty peachy Brown it's
fantastic I love it okay guys so that
completes this video I hope you guys
