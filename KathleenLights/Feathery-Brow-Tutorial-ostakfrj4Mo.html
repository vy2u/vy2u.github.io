a tutorial on this look right here I'm
going to show you how to achieve these
feathery brows and then I just paired it
with a bold lip and I am extremely
excited about this video because it is
sponsored by Sephora
which honestly is really amazing cuz you
guys know I love Sephora so I'm teaming
up with them today to bring you this
unique brow trend that I have been
seeing everywhere recently Sephora has
recognized that this is a hot trend as
well and they have an amazing array of
brow products from a wide variety of
brands so all of the products featured
in this video can be found at Sephora so
that is what we are doing today I'm
going to show you how to achieve these
feathery brows and I encourage you to
create your own look and then post it
and hashtag trending at Sephora so let's
get started so I've already applied my
base and concealer now I'm just going to
jump into the brows I'm going to be
using my favorite brow products by
Anastasia starting with the Anastasia
brow Wiz in dark brown this pencil
really does give the look of real hair
helping them to look a little bit full
but natural at the same time I'm going
to start by brushing my hairs up using
the spoolie side of the brow is
now I'm going to start using really soft
strokes to mimic the look of real hair
make sure you don't press too hard
because that sometimes can look a little
bit unnatural or too harsh I'm just
following the natural shape of my
eyebrow now I'm just going to start
brushing out the hairs again just to
give it a softer effect you always want
to blend out any harsh strokes that you
created with the brows for a more
natural look now I'm going to use the
tinted brow gel by anastasiya this is
going to make your eyebrows look a
little bit fuller and give you that
feathery brow effect I am taking this
and brushing my hairs upwards especially
towards the front of my brows
now to make sure that this stays extra
locked and ready for the entire day I'm
taking a clear brow gel also by
Anastasia Beverly Hills and I'm
basically just going to go over
everything I just did this product has a
very strong hold and it will definitely
ensure that your eyebrows stay in place
for the entire day and then that
completes the brow look you have your
feathery eyebrows that are actually very
on-trend right now they are full but
they still have that natural look to
them to finish off the rest of my face
I'm keeping with that more natural theme
and for my eyes I'm just going to add a
few coats of the benefit roller lash
mascara I'm going to add a soft contour
and bronze to my face using the Too
Faced cocoa contour kit taking this
Sephora pro angled brush number 49 I'm
going to dip it into this cool tone
color and lightly contour
and then I'm using this more warm shade
to bronze the skin using the pro
flawless powder brush for blush I am
taking it the anarse blush in madly with
a Sephora Pro stippling brush and then
for highlight I am using the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector pressed in
moonstone with this Sephora Pro fan
brush and just adding a little bit to my
cheekbones
okay so to finish off the look I'm going
to apply a bold lip color just because I
think it pairs really well with this
brow technique and for that I'm going to
use the Sephora Rouge lipstick in the
shade it's a really beautiful berry
shade so that completes this look on
these feathery brows that are very
on-trend right now I hope you guys
enjoyed this look thank you so much for
watching oh don't forget to create your
own look and post it and hashtag
trending at Sephora and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
