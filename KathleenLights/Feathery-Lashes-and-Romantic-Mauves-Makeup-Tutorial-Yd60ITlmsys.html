hey guys so today's video is going to be
a makeup tutorial on this makeup right
here this is the look I was wearing in
my August favorites and in the
description I asked you guys comment
below if you want a tutorial and a lot
of you guys commented that you wanted a
tutorial on it a lot of you guys really
really like that look thank you so much
it was the exact same look I was wearing
in a picture I had posted on Instagram
Here I am filming it for you and this
video is different in two ways it is not
a voiceover it is a talk through
tutorial so I might be long and it might
be weird and too is I actually show you
applying my falsies this time I never
show me applying my falsies on camera
but this time I'm doing it because I
have a little trick that I learned and
you guys really liked my lashes so yeah
you want to see how to get this look
then just keep watching okay so I'm
going to start off with my face which is
rare for me but I don't find that I get
a lot of fall out with the eye shadow
look that I'm doing today so I'm going
to my face first and I'm gonna prime my
face with my baby this is the Too Faced
hangover primer with coconut water
electrolytes and probiotics I find that
it really does prolong the wear of my
makeup and it moisturizes really well
and another thing that I didn't mention
in my favorites video it smells really
good smells like coconuts definitely if
you are somebody with large pores and
dry skin then I would use this in
conjunction with like a silicone base
primer okay so the foundation I'm using
is my covergirl outlast stay fabulous 3
on 1 foundation in medium beige and this
is really rare but I'm using a buffing
brush from Real Techniques to apply that
especially with this foundation I always
use my Beauty Blender but
I don't know why am i using it today
just in the mood to use this brush I
guess
really quickly I'm going to prime my
eyelids I'm not gonna do my eyes right
now but I'm just gonna prime them
because I like to put a little bit of
concealer on them what I'm using my
concealer and this is just going to help
my concealer not crease at all I
seriously need to switch it up and start
using a different concealer you guys are
probably like may believe that Meghan
but it's so hydrating and creamy and
delicious and I can't get enough
blending that out with my trusty contour
brush from Real Techniques I have like a
Harry Potter birthmark in between my
eyebrows so I like concealing that this
is why I don't do voiceovers because I
just start talking all sorts of weird
stuff hey
I mean this is why I only do voiceovers
you see what am I saying hey yes yeah
I'm busy I can't at this moment but I
really cannot
I really can't
I'm taking this on my eyelids I'm gonna
go ahead and blend this out I'll be
right back
okay now that I look crazy like an alien
I'm gonna set my under eye concealer
with Max emphasized powder by the way
you do not need a pro card or to be a
pro member to get this I got mine online
if you have a pro store near you that
works oh this is not the brush I wanted
to use L a small tapered brush I haven't
had my coffee today
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to take makeup geeks creme
brulee I'm only using like three
eyeshadows in this look aside from my
brow bone highlight so it is incredibly
easy almost too easy
ticking creme brulee I'm going to take
this on a fluffy brush and I'm going to
play this to my crease and I'm not going
to be very precise with this I want this
to go everywhere
next I'm going to take makeup geeks
unexpected eyeshadow it's such a pretty
like muted grey purple and I'm going to
put this right where we put creme Brule
and then I'm going to take cupcake from
makeup geek and I'm going to do the same
thing just apply this or wear
and then I'm going to do the whole
process again just on my lid and you
could totally not do this in sections
you could do your hold it and your
crease at the same time but I'm a weirdo
now I'm just going to go back into my
fluffy brush back into creme brulee and
just blend everything out just like buff
it all out remember this is a very messy
eye look you know just everything nice
and blown out yeah I'm going to
highlight underneath my brow bone with
my Physicians Formula shimmer strip in
naturally nude and I'm going to mix
these two colors right here and I'm
going to use my makeup geek outer V
brush
where my inner corners right here I'm
gonna take my Josie Maran coconut water
I shadow in Playa del pink
yes playas up pink and I'm just going to
stamp this guy right here no it looks
wicked right now but I blend it out and
I like using this with this look right
here because since everything is matte I
like it to be a little bit shimmery in
the inner corners and it take that pink
metallic color so it goes well with this
I'm gonna line my waterline with can you
guess Maybelline's master drama in
midnight master and I'm in a tight line
as well really quickly I'm going to curl
my lash out on just kidding
no just kidding we have more stuff to do
ah now for my lower lash line I'm going
to do the exact same thing I did on my
lid so I'm going to take creme Brule
smudge it underneath on a pencil brush
unexpected smudge it underneath
and then cupcake and smudge it
underneath
quickly curling my lashes and I'm going
to apply some mascara I'm going to use
my perversion from Urban Decay that came
in my Ipsy bag and then I'll be right
back to show you what I did with my
lashes because I got a lot of questions
about them ok so I have finally let my
mascara dry a little bit and now I'm
going to go ahead and apply my falsies
in the picture I posted on Instagram it
was the same day that I filmed my
favorites video and I got tons of
questions asking me what eyelashes I was
wearing and I actually got this idea
from Tenny MS maven calm on youtube she
actually did this exact thing with her
eyelashes so I take no credit for this I
actually saw her do this in one of her
videos and I thought that it was the
most beautiful thing ever so I have been
doing it with my lashes and I love it
so I just use the regular Ardell natural
whispies really inexpensive at the
drugstore they're just basic wispy
eyelashes but I cut them up I don't know
if you could tell I like cut them in
four sections so I just took it and
literally cut them into four different
sections and that's how I applied them
onto my lashes so that they are all
different lengths and they look kind of
wispy I saw her do it in a video and I
was like mesmerised they were so pretty
so I'm just gonna take a little section
like this apply some lash glue from
house of lashes shake it up and let it
get tacky and then I'm going to apply it
downwards like this I find it is easier
for me to do it that way
okay so and I'm going to take the
longest section I don't know if you can
see that it's like the middle part of
the wispy and I'm going to fly it to
kind of like the middle right here I'm
going to leave the tiny little space so
that they could look kind of separated
it's basically like applying individual
lashes only in four different sections
so it's a little bit easier than
individual lashes
okay so I went ahead and did this I -
I'm just waiting for the glue to dry and
I know it's not for everyone I just
think it's really cool like how wispy
and like different they look I don't
know okay so now moving on to the rest
of my face now that all my eye makeup is
done I'm going to do some contouring I'm
going to use my Ben Nye powder Rouge in
contour number one this is what it looks
like and I'm actually going to take it
on this brush right here from morphe
brushes and I'm just going to take this
side and dip it in like this on its side
and start to contour like that
then I'm going to go ahead and just buff
it out with the fluffy part or this part
right here
okay and then take it to my temples and
on to the tops of my forehead just to
make a look a little smaller
now put some underneath my chin
now I'm going to go in with blush and
I'm going to take makeup geeks honeymoon
blush this is what it looks like is
beautiful and I'm going to use my Real
Techniques blush brush and apply some to
my cheekbones I mean to my shakes
I love this blush so much so much next
I'm just going to highlight and I'm
going to dunk it rot hers just add some
of that to my cheeks to the cheekbones
okay now I'm going to finish off with my
lips and I'm going to use my Too Faced
perfect lips lip liner in perfect nude
then I'm just going to take a little bit
of this two-faced lipstick in naked
dolly I'm going to stamp it right in the
middle okay so that's it that completes
this makeup look I really hope you
