long-awaited if see bag unboxing I know
a lot of you guys thought that I wasn't
doing these videos anymore because I
didn't upload
um the Ipsy bag for last month but the
only reason I didn't upload one last
month is because when I got the bag I
still hadn't had my setup ready and I
was still like unpacking and doing a
bunch of things that I really didn't
have time to sit down and film that
video so by the time I did it was
already like the end of the month and I
had already opened the bags so that's
not an unboxing is it and then today is
when I got this bag literally today and
it is the 20th of February which is kind
of upsetting because I never get my bags
this late I usually get it around the
13th of the month and it's the 20th and
I wasn't planning on filming today but I
ran outside and I saw this sitting in my
front yard and yes this was just thrown
in my front lawn I don't know but yeah I
literally just got it so let's open this
bad boy so it comes with this little
card the look of love oh and this is
what the bag looks like it's really cute
it looks really nice on on camera
doesn't look that neon in person
I like the bag so the inside oh my god
the inside has leopard print that is
cute that is really cute so the first
thing I see is this open Zohan nail
polish and you either got two colors I
got the purple one and this is in the
shade
odet it's a beautiful purple color I
don't have tons of purple nail polishes
and I love joy and nail polishes they're
really good quality and they retail for
nine dollars which is almost the price
of the bag so I'm glad that I got this
the next thing I see in my bag are these
false eyelashes from the brand J cat
we've gotten this bread in our empty
bags before and I mean it's pretty cool
I you guys know that I don't want false
lashes it's just not my thing I would
really love to get into wearing false
lashes cuz I think they are beautiful
but I feel like it's just such a half so
I rather just put on mascara and go but
I mean I'm gonna try it out maybe in a
video because I think they are really
really pretty
they're very very full I like them these
eyelashes retail for about $4 I believe
so
the next thing in my bag is the thing
that I was most excited about everybody
got these wet nail polish and the pop
beauty lip gloss the other stuff was
random for everybody but everybody did
get these two items and I'm so glad that
I actually got the color that I wanted
this is fuchsia freesia fuchsia freesia
by the way excuse my hair like I said
wasn't planning on filming today so I
mean it's just this actually isn't the
full size I believe I think the
full-size ones are like really really
fat but this seems to have a lot of
product in it anyway and the color is
beautiful it's like a really nice hot
pinky fuchsia I can't really detect a
scent that is strong or anything
maybe it's my nose but I don't smell
anything a full-size version of this
retails for $16 so I think it's kind of
cool that we got like a mini version of
them it's cute I also got this gold
looking lip gloss but it's not a lip
gloss this is a shadow tint in spiced
rum shadow tint okay Oh
that's really pretty this is like a
cream shadow I'm guessing yeah this is a
cream shadow in the shade spiced rum and
it's actually really pretty you guys
know how I feel about my golds and my
bronzes so I'm deaf okay that wasn't
that was an over exaggerated swatch but
I really like it
smells like you know cosmetic II you
want I mean like plastic cosmetic II not
too fond of the scent I don't even know
what brand this is I'm sure it says it
on the Ipsy website what brand this is
but this does look like something I'm
going to be using because it's pretty
and from the looks of it this is a
full-size product and this alone is $18
which is more than what you paid for the
Ipsy bags and then the last thing in my
bag is the Pacifica Hawaiian Ruby guava
body butter I've heard so many good
things about Pacifica they sell these at
Target and I believe Ulta I've just
never tried it myself
but let me smell this I smell it from
the outside already it whoa from the
outside I smell the guava like you don't
understand it's okay this smells like
intense guava I really really like it I
really do I personally love Whyalla
that's how you say in Spanish it's like
one of my favorite things to eat if you
are not a fan of the guava scent you're
not going to like this because I smell
like a botanical right now I really love
this and unfortunately I'm probably not
gonna be able to wear this around Danny
because there is nothing Danny hates
more than voila like he hates it the
smell that he hates it but anyway this
retails for $7 this is the smaller one
they have like the bigger ones at Target
and I'm not sure if that one's seven or
this one sup no this one is $7 I think
the bigger one is like twelve but yeah
this is seven bucks which is pretty good
I'm really glad that I got this because
it is very very thick and buttery even
though I hate the feeling
cream on my hands it drives me crazy but
this would be good for like my arms and
stuff I like this okay guys so is
everything I got in this month's APC
back actually really really did like
this month I liked it better than last
month I wasn't a big fan of January's
but I really did like it all the things
I got are things that I know I'm going
to use I wasn't too crazy about the
lashes just because I'm not a false lash
wear but everything else seems pretty
promising I really did love this month
if you guys want to check out ABC just
go to FC comm and subscribe it's $10 a
month and it is worth every penny for me
I think out of all the beauty
subscriptions this is the best one at
least the ones that cost $10 if sees
where it's at girl if she's worth
I'm gonna try out the soy and nail
polish on my fingers I'm just gonna
swatch it I actually took off my nail
polish because I like I said I wasn't
planning on filming I was planning on
doing my nails so maybe I will paint it
this color I love this color so much I
don't know if you could tell but it's
like a deep plum II purple it's not like
a bright like loud purple I hope my god
I love it so much I'm definitely gonna
be painting my nails this color I'm like
dancing with my finger I'm gonna try on
the pop beauty I have like chapstick on
now that I'm now that I'm putting it on
my lips I do smell something so this is
what the gloss looks like I really
really love it it looks super super
super glossy and shiny but it's not
sticky at all like at all
feels like I'm wearing tastic oh I love
it I love it it up let's see how this
cream shadow looks on its own I do have
mascara on but we'll see let me zoom
Ewan
I really really like this I think it
would make a beautiful base for um gold
shadows or like bronzy smokey eyes I
don't really know how it wears or for
creases or anything like that but so far
I really really love it thank you so
much for watching guys please subscribe
if you haven't already and I will see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
