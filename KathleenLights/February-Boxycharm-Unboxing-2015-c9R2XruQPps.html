my February because it's February
boxycharm unboxing I forget the month
every time I'm gonna do this intro like
I don't know why February dude come on
so yeah let's just break this in okay so
this is what the that's what the box
looks like this month it says kisses
from buck see Sharon and yeah it has the
little thing dang it
where it lists everything you got and
the prices and such and they say I'm
excited okay
I love boxycharm if you guys don't know
what box of tremens I always just dive
into these videos if you guys don't know
what boxycharm is it's a monthly
subscription service where they send you
beauty products for twenty one dollars a
month usually these beauty boxes send
you like deluxe samples they're usually
pretty big samples but boxycharm
dedicates themselves to like full-size
so that's why I'm like a boxy term I
don't know what that was
okay so let's jump in the first thing I
see is like the biggest box here and
this says facial mask on it my hair is a
mess ignore it I haven't done my hair
like two weeks I just I decided to give
up it says a facial mask and then it
says Mullen Mullen and Sparrow and I've
actually heard of this brand Mullen and
Sparrow if I'm saying that right because
I shop a lot on hip apotheca calm and
they have this brand so I am very
excited
this is Mullen and Sparrow mini facial
mask oh this is actually the looks size
sample okay what I said in the beginning
of video most of the time like 90% of
their products are full-size but this is
a deluxe sized sample and this retails
for $15 which that's a lot of money for
a little look sized sample it says this
facial mask contains a blend of powerful
detoxifying clays mixed with mixed with
soothing
aromatic herbs that help to refine pores
provide a gentle exfoliation okay
awesome this is like an exfoliator and
oh my god
this is so pretty it looks like message
in was like a message in a bottle
doesn't it this is a pretty I'm actually
very happy with this how often do you go
through these like powder exfoliators
not very often this is so cute to kind
of like display in your bathroom is that
weird that I feel that way it is
I love exfoliators especially ones that
are gentle and I just love to exfoliate
so I will definitely be using this I
have used powder exfoliators before and
they're really good you just add some
water and then rub it into your skin
it's good stuff so that's good the next
thing is this and this is so freaking
cute this is a nail polish from the
brand and CLA Los Angeles these nipples
are expensive I think let me see yeah
these nail polishes are 16 dollars each
and I'm used to paying like 10 bucks
less so girl that suspense this is in
the shade or like in the color heart
attack which is really cute because I
guess what the Valentine's Day theme it
has a bunch of hearts in it oh my god
this is so cute to like oh my god I love
it my nails have been breaking so bad
because I've been doing gel manicures so
I'm like off the gel manicure thing like
I'm not doing them anymore and I'm
trying to let them like you know if you
know what that meant at all alrighty
then next thing in the Box is this this
is Jing I what Jing I'm probably
butchering that shine lip jewel this is
a full-size so was that nail polish by
the way this is also full size and it is
in the shade it raspberry ice oh oh it's
like a little jumbo lip crayon I love
these I have like a whole little jar
full of them
let's try this on raspberry ice oh crap
I expected it really sheer this is so
pigmented that is so pretty usually
these like jumbo did I put this on right
probably not
usually these jumbo things are kind of
like a sheer color which is nice too but
this is halo pigment gene and this
retails for
$22 so this is definitely like a
high-end brand I've never heard of it
but definitely like more expensive oh
right
next thing is this guy right here from
the brand mister up we've gotten this
brand in the box trim before this says
mr. Buda Buda beauty solutions see to
peak complexion corrector this is
full-size and this is $36.99 what this
looks like a concealer or something this
new cream to powder complexion corrector
is rich with coconut oil shea butter
with a silky matte finish that leaves
your skin hydrated and blemish free the
super light formula instantly masks
redness and hides imperfections with one
touch for all skin tones that's
interesting okay okay yeah okay I kind
of see where they're going with this
it has like a Salminen kind of peachy
undertone can you see it but then when
you blend it in it just kind of blends
in with at least with my skin tone this
was probably cool to like correct dark
circles or something I'm not exactly
sure how I'm gonna use this and I'm not
exactly sure how this is used honestly
because not everybody is the same skin
tone but it says it's for all skin tones
so I'm definitely gonna look into this
mom was confused okay and then the last
thing in the bag is this I love brushes
I love when I get brushes and little
boxes like this that's so dumb but I do
this is modern minerals duo-fiber
mini round brush this is full-size and
this brush retails for $15 so of this
ain't cheap oh no oh no cute I like it I
like it it's kind of like a fatter
pencil brush you could cut you could use
this to like smoke out lower lash line
or like a cut crease or something I see
myself using using this so that was 15
bucks
that was everything I got in the box
this month I'm really really excited for
the majority of these products honestly
I love exfoliators this is so pigmented
and it's actually a pretty color I
really like this a lot and of course I'm
gonna get use out of that brush and that
nail polish is really cute the only
thing I'm like how how am I gonna use
you is this but I bet you all find a way
so I added all the prices and this box
is worth one hundred and four dollars
this month
seriously I say it every month but I
don't know how they do it makes no sense
to me I didn't really try on anything
because there's not much I could try on
except make me this but I have you know
I'm saying you know if you guys want me
to use these products and videos let me
know I'm thinking of doing a video kind
of like probably very soon like just
using products that I've got it in my
previous boxycharm and how they still
work for me or if they work from here at
all you know stuff like that so so yeah
you paid $21 and it was worth over $100
so that is amazing to me I and I'm a
huge believer in this brand or this
company ah-oh mess today thank you guys
