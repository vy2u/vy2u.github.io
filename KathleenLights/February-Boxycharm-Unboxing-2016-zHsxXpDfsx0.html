and that's I can't say boxycharm anymore
and I refuse to so really quickly I just
want to mention something I hate filming
when my nails are chipped like I don't
think there's a video on my channel well
maybe where my nails are chipped and
it's so weird because I'll watch a video
where someone's nails are chipped and I
won't even notice like I won't even
think anything of it I don't care if
people's nails are chipped like that's
not something they bought her mutters
that's not something that bothers me you
know some people are like turned off by
that like that does not bother me I
don't care maybe your nails are chipped
but for some reason really bothers me
when I'm editing my video and my nails
are chipped isn't that weird
these two nails like the paint fell off
of them 20 minutes before I sat down on
both of these I was like um no I'm not
gonna sit down and paint my nails right
now so I'm gonna film my video like this
hey guys so today's video I'm gonna
unbox my boxycharm
so I'm gonna stop being weird and open
this so took me like 20 minutes open
this box anyway uh so this month's box
looks like this so this month's theme is
rush to relax I don't know if you could
read that or if you can see it but it
says rush to relax from salado's to
slippers get ready to work hard and rest
easy so the first thing I see is this
from Oprah which is awesome I actually
have this it's in my little like I have
a palette that I have specifically for
like contour products highlighting
products and all that stuff like a Z
palette and I have this in here this is
Oprah's banana powder and this is a
full-sized product how much is this this
retails for twelve dollars and you just
pull it out and this is what it looks
like it's just the pan it's like the
refill size but this will just like
stick to your Z palettes if you have any
Z palette this is pretty much around the
same size as the Anastacio banana powder
if you're familiar with that and I like
these yellow powders but I could only
use them if I'm tan like if I'm self tan
because these yellow powders will just
look too yellow underneath my eyes if
I'm
more complexion like I am right now I
just won't go down there trying to set
up this room there's so much that still
needs to be done that's why I haven't
been filming so much like in front of my
vanity like I always do because it's a
hot mess although you guys asked I'm
just letting you know okay so the next
thing in the Box is this thing right
here this is like gigantic and I was
just sitting there
oh it says boxycharm limited edition I
don't know if this is just specifically
in this month's box that's cool what is
this look as good as you are
miss amazing sensitive dry skin
moisturizing mask okay this is a mask
yes
from the brand Shrey miss amazing it
just says dream this amazing facial mask
this is full-size and this retails for
$12 and I'm gonna assume it's like a
sheet mask oh cool it gives you like a
pictorial that's really cool yeah this
is a sheet mask or you look like Jason
from mmm from Jason yeah right that's
the movie just Jason I don't know I
don't watch scary movies but it's a
sheet mask just put it on you have like
the Jason face I'm really excited to use
this because it says it's for a dry
sensitive skin which is literally my
skin type I have dry sensitive skin so
I'm very excited to use this and
honestly I think that anyone can benefit
from a moisturizing mask even if you
have oily skin a lot of people think
that when you have really oily skin they
try to use products that really dry out
their skin you know like to suck up all
the oil but you shouldn't be doing that
because then your skin is just going to
produce more oil because you keep taking
it keep taking its oil comes with a
little mask and I'm really excited just
gonna put that there
okay let's keep going there are more
products that we usually get five
products in the box and this month we
have six okay so the next product is
this this was in the box right here and
at first I thought it was a box of
chocolates but it's not this is from a
brand called sponge le sponge le swine
is small gee I don't know it says small
surely you have my heart on a string and
this is full-size a heart shape
body wash infused buffer enriched with
hydrating olive oil and a blend of
energizing and toning extracts how cool
this is a sponge and it has like oils
and buttery stuff in it so I'm not going
to open this right now because as I'm
squishing this sponge I can tell that
there's like stuff in it it just it has
directions on the back which is awesome
moisten buffer with water and squeeze to
release the lather use the soft side to
cleanse and tone the skin use a texture
side in a gentle circular motion to
exfoliate oh this is the texture side
right here I'm going to assume okay
let's keep on moving let's keep up
what's that
let's do this one okay this is from a
brand called freeze 24/7 anti-aging eye
serum say goodbye to fine lines wrinkles
dark circles and puffiness with
groundbreaking lightweight eye serum
this is a full I'm not okay I don't want
to sound mean doesn't this look like a
lip balm like a juicy little lip balm
that you can find at CVS or like Sephora
or whatever but it looks like a tiny
just like a little lip balm this is $58
this is $50
this better change my life cuz $50 dirt
that's a spent and I mean it feels nice
but it doesn't feel $58 worth I'll tell
you that but I mean it's cool because
you don't pay that much for the bucks
you know so it's a win-win I guess
alright so the next thing in these books
is these oh it says perfume on here okay
this is real tree for her it is a travel
spray so this is enough full-size but
this retails for $12.99 this little
bottle let's see what this looks like
that is a cute little spray
Oh oh my god oh my god I like this a
delightful fragrance with the sweet
scent of Wommack I ate it sweet scent of
pomegranate and a hint of persimmon and
an exotic scent of orchids I like it
I really like it sorry it's not like my
favorites not like flower bomb or
something but smells really fresh a
little bit sweet a little bit floral but
like really fresh - I really like this
and I think it's like a cute little
spray to just throw on your person I'm
thinking it alright and then the last
thing in the Box is this right here and
this is a beauty for real blush and glow
stick this is full-size and this retails
for $24 oh I didn't tell you guys how
much this is this is a full-size product
and this is $15 back to this this is a
full-size product and this is $24 I'm
smelling really good right now I really
like that okay so this is the blush and
glow cream of blush and Luminizer in the
shade coral crush and high-beam looks
like a little double ended thing
guessing this is the illumination side
right here it's a little bit dark for my
like umm fair skin like the highlight
part but for anybody with a deeper skin
tone than me I think this would work for
you so that's really awesome
for us really fair girls or extra fair
that's probably not going to work before
deeper skin tones that's really pretty
and then this is the blush side this is
beautiful this blush will definitely
work for me and I think for a lot of
people too it's also not greasy like
when I blend it with my finger it
doesn't feel greasy or like chunky or
weird so this is probably a promising
product I don't know you'll probably see
me applying it in this video I'm not
sure if I'm going to love it or if I'm
going to hate it but it's cool it's a
cool product for sure so I just did the
math and the overall value of this
month's box is over 130 dollars more
than 130 dollars so you pay $21 for your
box as you guys know and you get
products that are worth over $100 it's
insane
it's insane so I'm gonna leave the
boxycharm website below and yeah I
really like this month I'm actually
really impressed with this perfume this
eye serum and the packaging is so cheap
II looking that I'm shocked that it's
fifty eight fifty eight or 48 sixty
bucks like this is 58 bucks look at this
is a freaking lip balm I'm gonna use
this and I'm totally gonna see how it
goes and this is really cool I'm all for
sheet masks that Oprah banana powder is
really awesome if you are a little bit
like medium to deep skin tones that's
awesome leave me a comment down below
letting me know what you liked in your
box like what was your favorite product
