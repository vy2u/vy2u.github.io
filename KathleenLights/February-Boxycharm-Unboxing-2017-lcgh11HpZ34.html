back to sharing Backson I am so hungry I
don't think I've ever been this hungry
in my entire life
I feel like there's a giant hole in my
stomach and it's just screaming for food
but we got a video of some of your folks
so food's gonna have to wait okay so
usually I feel like I have more things
to talk about in my intro but let's just
get into the inbox well you guys know I
already unboxed it I always take a peek
I know I say this in every video but
just in case have new subscribers I
always open the box first just let I
know what products are inside I don't
swatch them I don't really look at them
I just feel like okay there's like a
blush of this so this just so I know not
to put those products on my face because
I like trying the products out on camera
but you already know that so this is one
jar box looks like this month and the
first thing you see this is just big boy
right here oh there is a 25% off coupon
in the box for dr. Brandt skincare the
code is just buck c25 in case you're
watching this but you don't have
boxycharm you can get 25% off using a
box t25 checkout offer only valid
compare very 15th to March 1st I try to
say that plastic and infomercial anyway
this is the big bad boy right here this
is the omni eye kit from royal and
langnickel i actually really excited
that we're getting this in the box
because I do really love royal and
langnickel I'm pretty sure they have
this brand at Michael's I'm not sure if
they have like the omnia set at Michaels
but they have their regular like craft
brushes there they don't only do makeup
brushes they do like crap brushes as
well actually have this brush
religiously it is my favorite eyebrow
brush in the world this is the rolling
langnickel number 10 brush I got this at
michaels years ago look whatever I love
this so I really like rolling lean to go
and the box to get the omnia eye kit
which is really cool I really love the
colors of these brushes you have a
really pretty gold one and then a
beautiful like copper one item F copper
they're really soft this one is good for
like underneath the brow bone or all
over the lid this one is awesome for the
inner corners or like smudging
underneath the eye this is their detail
brush and this is their shader brush
these are obviously full-size brushes
and this retails for $29.99
viii the omnia kit not like each
individual brush this little kit right
here is twenty nine nine eight thirty
bucks which is about fifteen dollars per
brush they do have a shadows in the box
this month so I will be using this in
just a second the next thing we have in
the glass is this little to be seen this
is the dr. Brandt microdermabrasion age
defying exfoliator Ruth's skin radiance
polishes and smooth helps diminish the
look of fine lines it's so funny because
I was actually going to purchase this a
couple of months ago because I thought
in microdermabrasion facials in the past
and they've really really worked for me
so when I saw this I thought maybe this
would help all the bumps I had you guys
know when I was having my skin issues I
thought this might work I really wanted
to try it but I was scared at the same
time because I didn't want something to
make me even more sensitive like I was
just scared to try out new stuff but I'm
excited that we got in the box I would
have used it in today's video but I used
like some chemical exfoliating peel mask
a couple days ago and I don't want to
like over exfoliate I'm a little bit
afraid my skin is my polar out of one
out center so yeah I'm really excited to
try this and I believe this is the full
size right yes yes right yes this
retails for $79 Europe that's a Francis
that is a lot of money for an exfoliator
so maybe it's because it's a
microdermabrasion one and dr. Brandt is
a very pricy skincare line I feel we
have a $79 face scrub and the bosses
mark is kind of cool I'm very into that
I cannot wait to try it if you've tried
this exfoliator please let me know in
the comments below if you liked it to
the irritate your skin did it help your
skin I would love to know because I
think I've heard a couple things about
their blue exfoliator is comes in like a
blue packaging but I haven't heard much
about this one so please let me know
don't wait okay so a nice thing in the
book is this gamma so in this month's
box we have to makeup geek eyeshadows I
always get excited when I see makeup
geek in boxycharm because I love mega
speak so much and I believe in that
brand so much that I get excited so they
have two channels in the box month I'm
not sure if everyone got the exact same
shadow I'm assuming that there are some
people that are getting different
eyeshadows
I'm not sure but in my box I have cherry
cola and prom night
know how I'm going to do an eye look
with this because there's only two
shadows but I am gonna apply them to my
eyes just so you can see I mean to be
honest we all know that makeup geek has
really create quality eye shadows it's
not something I have to try out because
I already know I actually already have
these shades yeah I shouldn't open these
right that would be done I already have
these okay I'm gonna go get mine because
I have cherry cola and prom night hold
on I'm going to save this for like my
friend who doesn't have this yeah hold
on I know I'm gonna do this because okay
so assuming I could do this one on the
lid this is probably not going to be the
best look because I'm only using two
eyeshadows and these are definitely
shadows that I would pair with other
colors I do have a little bit of bronzer
on my lower lash line but that's about
it
I'm going to take the roiling langnickel
ammonia number 18 detail brush I'm going
to take cherry cola and I'm going to
smudge this on my lower lash line this
brush is really soft you know how
sometimes these tiny little like smudgy
brushes when you try to blend it
underneath your eyes or pencil brushes
even if they're not really soft or like
scratch your eye and this doesn't do
that are you guys all caught up with
Jane the virgin out just stomach it does
hurt if you put it in your eye no matter
what brochure you like I was pained are
you guys all caught up with Jane the
Virgin I'm not going to give any
spoilers that would be horrible I'm not
but let's just say I don't know how I'm
going to get over what happened anyway
so I love cherry cola it's my favorite
makeup eyeshadow I'm going to ask them
to the outer corners just going to use a
little fluffy crease brush this is the
marquee m51 for going to put some on the
outer corners I do have concealer on my
lids by the way I didn't go on like my
bare eyelid I wish my bare eyelid looked
like this have so many veins on my I'm
just going to take some of that into my
crease as well
okay so that is cherry cola I pretty
much put that everywhere I just left the
inner corners a little bit blank I'm
going to go in with prom night and apply
it there
and then if it needs more blending I'll
go back in with cherry cola I'm going to
use the royal and langnickel omnia
number 40 shader brush and I'm going to
take prom night
and I'm just going to apply some of that
right here it's just a really soft taupe
color and has like a shimmery satin
finish there isn't any glitter in it or
anything now I'm just going to go back
in with a little rolling ring nickel
brush and deepen up the lower lash line
and I'm also going to go back in with
cherry cola and take some into my crease
just to blend everything out again I can
we split I look I'm going to go ahead
and pop on some mascara and I will be
right back as they're officially done
the next thing in the Box is this guy
right here which is so cool when I first
saw this when I first open the box I was
like what this is a Z palette but the
cool thing about this one is it's like a
collab with boxycharm and z palettes so
that was like a little boxy charm logo
on the back this is the small Z palette
which by the way you hold about 9 I
shadow this small Z palette made
exclusively for boxy charm features an
open-face magnetic waves and I mean easy
this is what it looks like it's just
their standard small Z palette but it's
cute that this one is like a boxy charm
one I think that is so good cute not
cool cute and you can just pop in the
two makeup geek shadows you got right
into the center and last but certainly
not least is this guy right here this is
from the brand Juice Beauty it is their
reflecting gloss in the shade figs it
says shimmer your lips in brilliant
color with this reflecting gloss that
contains a blend of organic
antioxidant-rich acai and goji berries
minerals and sweet agave for the most
brilliant shine are that's pretty
freakin amazing
this is what it looks like this is not
typically a color I would wear our
gloves I'm not even gonna lie I don't
know if I'm gonna like this but let's
try it up I don't know colors like this
I feel like make me look weird it almost
doesn't even feel like a glove I'd
rather give you someone who hates a
really sticky glob they go off the kind
of look to the lips you might really
really like this because it's very sane
but for me personally I don't know if I
love this I'm like tasting it it doesn't
taste the best but yeah guys that
completes the boxes look I was
everything I got in my box is shame so I
did them women I decide okay so this is
a full-size lip gloss and this retails
for $15 you can get this at Ulta anyway
I did the math and the overall valley
for the box is over a hundred and forty
dollars like more than 140 which is a
great deal considering the only play 21
thoughts of charm is a really nice way
to try out full-size for beauty products
for a really affordable price well I
know what you got in your box a charm
this month if you hated you love it what
did you think let me know in the
comments below but yeah that completes -
