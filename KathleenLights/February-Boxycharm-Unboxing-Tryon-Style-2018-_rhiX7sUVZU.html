my bucks is Sherman boxing I am so sorry
this video is going up so late I usually
never post my boxycharm videos so late
in the month but I actually got it a
little bit later than usual so I tried
to film as soon as possible and that's
fitting I'm actually having a very
frustrating day today I'm just drinking
some coffee to calm me down
even though coffee doesn't calm down my
body but for some reason it comes down
my mind but I actually just got back
from the dentist and I got new trays of
Invisalign I am on my second tray I have
eight trays in total so I think that's
around like eight months the first three
days I got Invisalign like the brand new
trays I was miserable for those first
three days and I just got back from the
dentist and I got a new tray and right
now when I pulled them off to sit down
to film this video I just know I'm gonna
be in so much pain when I put them back
in I hate things they have to do with my
teeth my mouth but I got it I got a
stick with it anyway long a thin driver
Wow
that's right little thing just flipped
right out okay okay so this is what the
box looks like this mom the theme is
galaxy glow and I'm just gonna jump
right into it the first thing I pulled
out is this Sarafine botanicals sugar
and lemon moisturizing lip buffer which
I'm very excited about because my lips
are so chapped right now it says it's a
blend of soft sugar crystals with a rich
nourishing soft base that gently
exfoliates and buffs lips leaving behind
smoother skin with a touch of refreshing
lemon zest scent ooh I'm excited oh wait
I feel like ever since I got Invisalign
I talk really really weird even when my
Invisalign is not in my mouth I kind of
feel like my tongue is just like dancing
in my mouth it's so weird so as I'm
talking to you these days I'm gonna be
talking weird three months and then some
after that probably so I'm sorry how I
thought this was a I think I don't know
what I thought this was yeah okay so I'm
just gonna apply some of this onto my
lips just removing the lip balm I had on
mmm this smells so good if you don't
like lemon you're not gonna like the set
this smells really familiar
I feel like this kind of smells like
lemon bubblegum it is a little bit oily
but the crystals are really big so I
feel like it does do a good job of
exfoliating at first when I was blending
it out I was like this is too oily for
me it's not really exfoliating but
rubbing it in with my makeup wipe it's
really getting the crystals all up in
there
my lips are nice and exfoliated but
honestly just using sugar and like oil
at home works the same you know what I
mean but anyways it is nice to have
something that you don't have to make
and this is a full-sized product and it
retails for $24 all right so I just
popped onto my dreaming ultra satin lip
by colour-pop and now we can move on
with the rest of the box so the next
thing we have or a bunch of brushes
these are from crown brushes these are
all full-size obviously in this trio
retails for $29.99 if I could say retail
weird
they just say retail and I'm actually
using brushes really quick I actually
haven't set my under eye concealer at
all it's a little crazy oh I should use
this one for concealer ah but I already
put on concealer this would been perfect
these feel really really soft ooh I'm so
pink today these are so cute they
actually remind me of the wet and wild
brushes you know the white ones that
have the pink tip and my crazier do
these look identical to that all right
so I'm gonna take this one and I'm gonna
use that just to blend out that
concealer because is a little bit Creasy
right now since I haven't set it and
then I'm gonna take my ELF Beauty shield
powder with this tapered brush and I'm
gonna use that to set underneath the
eyes I feel like my voice is going away
what is happening
really quickly I'm gonna take a little
bit of this girl lactic face glow in the
shade natural and I'm just gonna dust
this kind of like all over my face and
I'm not gonna do anything to my eyes at
all since there's nothing in the box to
really try out but I'm gonna take this
brush and I'm gonna take a little bit of
that face glow I just used and I'm gonna
highlight my brow bone with this
actually no I'm gonna go into Moonie
from my dream Street palette and then in
my inner corners
I've cooked cook okay so there's
actually an eye liner oh my gosh I'm a
fool directly to products that I could
use on my eyes like what was it was it
paying attention
this is the cover effects shimmervale
and this is in the shade
amethyst who would love amethyst I have
them like all over my house they're my
favorite and this is a full-sized
product and it retails for $28 I
actually think Gaby used this exact
shade on my eyes for the spring shoe we
just did and it looked beautiful so I am
just gonna pull it I don't know if
there's gonna go with this lip though I
am just gonna put a little bit on my
eyes and blend it out let's see let's
see I'm gonna apply it with the brush
are you with the applicator and then I'm
gonna blend it with my finger I think
it's amazing that we're getting this in
the box cuz I really really liked it I
don't know if coverfx only came out with
like these unicorny licking ones but it
would be awesome to see them create like
golds and bronzes and stuff like that
okay like I feel like I look like a 12
year old playing in makeup right now
with this little combo going on I'm
actually gonna take a little bit of my
dream Street palette and I'm gonna buff
some of shooting star into my crease
all right so I think I'm done with the
eyes I just need to add some mascara
actually I need to add some of that
eyeliner I'm just lending away some of
that fall out from that curve effects
glitter shimmer thingy okay so the next
thing in the Box is this guy this is
from vintage cosmetics and this is the
smokey eye pencil this retails for $21
this is the shade jet-black so I'm gonna
apply some of this to my waterline I
don't love wooden eyeliners like this I
much prefer a twist up you guys know
that I mentioned that all the time I'm
just gonna place some of this with my
waterline and I'm gonna tight line as
well okay so for being a wooden eyeliner
this went on so easily and so creamy
like my waterline is wack I mean I know
I wouldn't necessarily wear black
eyeliner like this like so harshly in
the waterline with this look but in
terms of formula I really like it so
maybe I will use this more often
even though it is wooden I think I'm
gonna keep it here on my vanity and use
it from time to time so really quickly
I'm gonna pop on some mascara my Thrive
cosmetics mascara and I will be right
back okay so I think these eyes might be
a little bit too purpley for this lip so
I'm just gonna throw on some moonchild
gloss on top to see if it tones it down
alright so there's only one more thing
in the box oh there's a little 20% off
coupon code for cover effects in the box
as well I didn't see that but the last
thing in this box
is this guy this is from the brand Naked
cosmetics love it's a holographic The
Naked cosmetics holographic highlighter
palette it is full-size and it retails
for $39.99 and it's one of those
holographic highlighters that are all
the rage these days not necessarily my
cup of tea but I know people really
really love them they're really great
for like
still holds photoshoots like I think
they're really unique and fun and you
can use them in many different ways but
for day-to-day I like a more natural
highlight but it's always nice to have
these on hand you know you never know I
think I'm actually gonna take this brush
that I didn't use and I'm gonna use the
gold just because it's the most wearable
out of all of them but this gold is very
yellow so I think I'm gonna mix it with
a pink I'm just gonna dip oh let me zoom
you and I should have never seen doubt
I'm gonna mix these two together I like
these two mixed together I'm gonna pick
up a little bit more of the gold this
time a lot more of the gold this time
apparently I mean it is a little bit
intense it does emphasize my texture
just a bit but it does look pretty cool
okay so it does look a little bit
strange right now just because I kinda
have like a self-tanner on at the moment
and when I look straight you can kind of
see the white stripes on my cheek so I
am gonna set everything and melt it all
into my skin with my morphe setting
spray
and I'm actually gonna use a couple of
these as eyeshadows mmm I'm gonna
highlight my brow bone with this green
one why not or you know what I'm gonna
use this one as my inner corner
highlight oh my gosh these would be
amazing eye shadows guys I don't love it
on my skin like I said it doesn't
emphasize my texture of it and because
these kind of have like a white
undertone you see it on my face it
doesn't look the most natural but these
can be used as really really pretty
eyeshadows and then I'm gonna take this
really beautiful one right here and I'm
gonna use that as my brow bone highlight
and then I'm gonna take some of that
gold and put it right on top okay guys
so that completes this video of these
where all the products I got in this
month's Bugsy Sherman I thought it was a
pretty interesting month I would have to
say my favorite product hands-down is
this shimmervale and these brushes are
really soft the eyeliner was really
black even though it was wooden I would
say my least favorite things are these
two but I don't know I think this would
look so cool all over the eyes I
actually do like this just not on my
face and this wasn't bad either like
I've exfoliated my lips I don't know I
don't think there was anything in the
box that I was like no but I would love
to know what you think of this month's
box did you love it did you hate it let
me know in the comments below how you
felt about the February box you sherm
