my February favourites and this video is
going up later than I wanted it to I
have been doing pretty good with my
videos when it comes to posting three
times a week but the video I was
supposed to post supposed to post on
Wednesday got to leave it for my
computer and it was a really cool cobalt
blue eye makeup tutorial if you follow
me on instagram you would have seen it
and a bunch of you guys wanted a
tutorial on it yeah that was supposed to
go up on Wednesday and it just vanished
from my computer along with a lot of
other clips I had recorded it was bad so
nine have to record that video all over
again not that that has anything to do
with this video but I just kind of
wanted to tell you guys why I didn't
post the video on Wednesday or Friday
because it's not Friday today either I
suck but anyway let's move on to what
this video is actually about and that is
my favorites so the first thing I want
to talk about is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation I am including this
in my favorites this month because
whenever I wanted a full coverage like
flawless face this is the foundation I
gravitated towards it is really really
good it gives like a flawless finish I
don't really know how to explain it it
is a whipped consistency but it's not
too thick on my skin I have a dry skin
so I have to moisturize before I put
this foundation on but it looks flawless
every single time I wear this foundation
I feel like I am red carpet-ready like
it looks so even so smooth it's like a
satin finish I wouldn't say it's matte
but it's definitely not dewy
I'm really really impressed I almost
love it as much as my regular Revlon
Colorstay foundation which is my
favorite drugstore foundation of all
time I almost love it as much as it
almost it's close if you have a problem
with pores or anything like that I would
use a primer underneath this foundation
just because it is like a moosie texture
and it might sink into pores a little
bit I do prime before I use it
so I have just been really loving it and
my top broke yeah it doesn't screw
anymore so my next favorite is my
wonderful naked
three pallet I feel like nobody is
talking about this anymore and I don't
know why I have been using this palette
so much that I have completely neglected
my original Naked palette which is
saying a lot since that's my baby
but I have just been absolutely crazy
about this palette especially this month
even though I've been doing really
natural eye makeup whenever I do go
full-on glam on my eyes this is the
palette that I've been using it's what's
on my eyes right now actually it's this
palette and I just wanted to mention it
because I loved it so much more than I
thought I would I like it ten times
better than my naked 2 palette like 10
times it I like it almost as much as my
original Naked palette I it complements
everyone's eyes like every time somebody
is wearing it their eyes look absolutely
beautiful no matter what I color you
have it's my favorite bronzer of the
month goes to the NYC Sun and bronze
bronzer in Montauk bronze just looks
like this it has like two light strips
and then three darker strips and swirled
up together it is a dream I never hear
anyone talking about this bronzer like
literally never no one talks about it
and even though NYC is one of those
brands we tend to you know walk past
this bronzer is so good it's really
really pigmented and it stays on my skin
all day it is the bronzer I am wearing
on my cheeks right now actually and it
is the bronzer I have been wearing a lot
it's in a lot of my videos recently and
I just keep it in my little drawer right
here and I use it pretty much every
single day I haven't used any of my
other bronzers and this is like two
dollars guys seriously go check out this
bronzer it is in the shade Montauk
bronze the name is right on the back I
made the best blush discovery this month
like the best and it is the Tarte
Amazonian clay blush in the color
exposed I am NOT a blush person but I
I'm trying and I'm starting to actually
really like blush this is what the shade
looks like seriously guys if you've
never tried any of the Tarte Amazonian
clay
lucious you need to go and at least buy
one
they're pretty pricey I'm not gonna lie
I think each blush is $28 30 28 26 but
they last all day I don't know what they
put in these suckers but I put it on my
cheeks and it will be there at nighttime
and my biggest pet peeve for blush is
that you put it on and like three hours
later the color is gone no these these
will stay in your hand you swatch it and
it will like stain your hand they last
forever so to me it's worth the price
since you're getting such good quality
and check out this color because it's my
favorite one that they have the other
ones are a little bit too bright for me
but this one it's a good one
so my next favorite I just quickly want
to mention because I use them all the
time and they're the elf custom compacts
they sell these things that target for
one dollar one dollar and they hold for
eyeshadows I keep my Mac eye shadows in
these just because it is so easy it's so
cheap and it's travel friendly you just
put your four favorite eyeshadows you
want to use stick it in your purse and
it's awesome plus it's got a giant two
mirror and these things are just so
amazing you just take your little eye
shadow mine has a magnet on the back and
they just flip right in and they don't
fall I really really love these go check
these out they're at Target I have to
give a shout out to the new love of my
life and it is the buxom White Russian
lip gloss this is heavenly it's what's
on my lips right now and I'm obsessed
this now is so amazing it smells like a
sweet delicious vanilla it is so good it
smells amazing in a stick I still smell
it it's oh and I just love it because it
stays on my lips all day and it has a
beautiful glossiness to it where your
lips look nice and plump this is
supposed to be like a lip plumper but it
does not hurt at all it's not like those
two-faced beast things things I don't
even know they're not got these things
they feel like peels bee stings lip
injections or something like that I
don't know what it's called but it is
nothing like that honestly you won't
even feel it it does have a cooling like
sensation it feels
little tingly and I personally love that
you just put it on and you feel like
food nice and tingly I love everything
about this I love the feeling I love the
texture I love how long it lasts I love
the color I want to get a bunch more of
these lip glosses because they are
pricey but I feel they're worth it a
hundred percent they last all days so I
have been topping this over all of my
new lipsticks all month and I've also
been sticking this in my purse and using
it over my natural lips too on a daily
basis and I love it that way as well my
last favorite is an honorable mention
and it is the mascara I have been using
non-stop for I don't even know how long
and if you watch my videos you know it
is the jordana best lash extreme oh my
god I used to hate this mascara like
absolutely hate it it was even in one of
my products I regret buying videos
because I hated it that much but I
learned that if I let it dry just a
little bit and I scoop the product off
the wand it's an amazing amazing mascara
I can't believe it's two dollars it
volumizes and thickens and my lashes so
much I get so many comments on my
Instagram like hey what mascara are you
wearing and nine times out of ten it is
this one just because it looks so thick
and volumizing I love using this when I
have absolutely nothing on my eyelids
because it's just so captivating I love
everything about this mascara if you
find that it is way too thick do what I
do and just scoop scoop it all off just
like brush it all off and then try using
it that way because that's the way I use
it and it works like that for me but I
just wanted to mention it because it's
so cheap and so good okay so that's it
that was everything I was absolutely
loving in the month of February thank
you so much for watching guys please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video
so amazing it smells like vanilla
vanilla no like a sweet delicious
delicious
yeah it's Oh Lord
I might um I don't
oh crap crap my next favorite is my
beloved oh is it
yeah is my amazing and wonderful
