February favorites there's still an echo
in this room because I don't have all my
furniture in here if you have no idea
what I'm talking about
and you're super confused by the ugly
yellow doors and the weirdness that's
going on behind me then watch my
previous video I explain everything
there I said I was gonna paint the doors
that day and we didn't end up painting
them and yeah things are moving a little
bit slow but they're moving along but
yeah I definitely watched that video if
you haven't yet but that's why there's
an echo anyway let's move on these are
the products that I have really really
been loving this month well in February
I'm super late on this video by the way
I always post the favorites videos right
on time right on schedule
but since I've been moving and since I
had no internet this sudden problem is
gonna get to me but anyway like I was
saying since I've had no internet I
haven't been able to film and post this
video and that's why there's a gap
between this one in my previous video
hopefully when this one goes up I will
have my internet all ready and I'll be
able to respond to comments and get the
ball rolling so yeah anyway let's jump
into the products I've really been
loving okay so my first favorite is a
huge game changer for me and this is the
Estee Lauder little black primer
basically a mascara primer and it is the
best I have ever used I went on this
huge hunt for the best primer for my
mascara because I didn't want to use
falsies all the time but I still wanted
my lashes to hold a curl longer and to
look longer and more voluminous so I
bought the Lancome one cuz they had
great reviews online and don't get me
wrong
it's a great primer it's amazing but
this one is ten times better like 30
2050
what I love about this one is that it
goes on black it is a black primer which
usually the primers are like white and
sometimes can turn your mascara gray but
this one goes on black and it is
phenomenal I first heard about this
because Emily Noelle mentioned it in her
like yearly favourites and I was like it
helps the check that out and I'm so glad
I did this gives my
a ton of volume actually apply this in
sections I do one I then apply mascara
and then do this I and then apply
mascara not only does it make your
mascara super super like thick and long
and black it amplifies them a ton but it
holds a curl big time like your
eyelashes stay curled throughout the
entire day and also it just makes your
mascara last a lot longer the only thing
I don't like about this is that it's a
little bit harder to remove than my
regular mascara
I despise waterproof mascara like I will
not I don't care I hate to waterproof
mascara because I just I don't like
going on the mission of taking it off
cuz I'm lazy like that but this kind of
makes it a little bit difficult to
remove not like waterproof status like
this does not waterproof your mascara at
all but it just you gotta you gotta you
gotta remove it a little bit better you
know what I mean but I could totally
deal with that because this is a
game-changer folks best primer ever my
next favorite is a perfume and I am a
perfume junkie I don't know if you can
see them I'm obsessed with her view and
this is the one that I have been wearing
all month I haven't worn another perfume
which I mean a lot of it has to do with
the fact that I had you know pack those
away during the move and this is the
only one I kept out but still I love it
this is the Jessica Simpson perfume and
this is called I believe it's called
signature like that's it doesn't say
anything on the bottle and the Box says
signature on it
so yeah Jessica Simpson signature I'm
pretty sure this is like the smallest
one that they carry I found that at Ulta
one day when I was like shopping and I
smelled it and I was like woohoo I loved
it so much that I just put it in my bag
and I bought it but I bought the small
one because I don't like perfumes made
by celebrities because they don't tend
to last a long time on my skin which is
the case for this this is a nice super
long wearing perfume by any means but I
love how its
it's very like bubbly and like girly
feminine and young and like for the
daytime that's why I really like it it's
very fresh like when I wearing this my
mom was telling me like man you smell so
good like I want to eat you it's a
little weird but she was like it smell
so good I want to eat you and I was like
I know just cause i'm sailin signature
it reminds me a lot of bubblegum like a
threat like a bubblegum and a fresh
springtime I don't know it's a mixture
of both like super fresh and kind of
like a bubblegum I would look up the
notes for you but you guys know I have
no reception and I have no internet so
yeah as you can see I made a huge dent
on this it I bought it this month and
it's the only perfume I've been wearing
well I bought it last month February
okay so these are so good guys I got
this in my swag bag when I went to the
Knicks event when I was in California
and these impressed me so much they kind
of blew me away a little bit these are
the Knicks gel pencil liners and holy
cow they are amazing I have mine in
pitch black and brown I don't know what
this means it says NYX tres Jolie that
is tres Jolie is that French I don't
know but it says NYX tres Jolie but
these are one of the best pencil
eyeliners that I've ever found at the
drugstore you guys know I'm a huge fan
of the Maybelline master drama and these
compete with that one I don't know I
think it might be even a little bit
better I know they're so creamy that you
don't need to pull on your like
waterline or like on your skin to a plus
to your waterline because you just go
and they go on so pigmented I'm talking
like true pigment super creamy and very
long wearing I feel like they they stay
on my waterline for a really long time
I'm wearing
Brown today in my waterline and let me
show you guys Oh another thing is that
it's twist up which I appreciate very
mucho cuz you know the lazy girl in me
doesn't like to sharpen but look okay
look look what what like why wait wait
you barely have to put any pressure now
I don't know if these are out yet
because I did get them in that swag bag
but check them out if they are out cuz
they're good I actually I'm gonna be
doing a video soon all about my new
favorite skin care products because I
have discovered really good skin care
stuff but I do want to mention this
because I have been using this a lot and
it's amazing it is from a pricy brand I
got this at Sephora like two months ago
or as soon as it released like it was on
the new display and it is the AL jinnah
store Alchemist al Genest genius
ultimate anti-aging melting cleanser now
this is expensive
okay desperate for here but the girl
like sold it to me she is like a friend
when I go to Sephora like the workers
know me already well it's not any more
big a little penny weight and the girl
was like you really really have to try
this it's amazing and she has oily skin
and it still works for her she really
liked it but basically this is like a
hybrid it's like it's a cleansing balm
but it has like three stages first it
applies as a gel so what I like to do is
I have a full face of makeup on right
and I put this on to my fingers and I
start to massage this all over my face
and it has like a gel consistency at
first so I as I start to massage it on
my face it turns into an oil so that is
like phase 2 phase 1 is a gel phase 2 is
an oil but it's not like greasy and
gross it just turns into an oil that
starts to really breaks down my face
makeup I usually take off my eye makeup
before but it really breaks down my face
makeup and then when you add water
turns into a milk like a milky
consistency and that is Phase three so
it goes through three different phases
and I feel like it really really helps
remove my makeup and then make my skin
feel like a baby's arse right after
honestly when I use this my skin feels
so plump so hydrated and that's amazing
for someone like me who has dry skin I
highly recommend it definitely going to
Sephora and get a sample of this because
this is changing the way that I take off
my makeup okay so next favorite I want
to give a quick shout out to the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless I
really love this foundation and I didn't
think that I was going to love it
because it's matte and poreless skin the
only thing is that if I'm going to use
this foundation by itself I have to
really really moisturize my skin and
then use a hydrating primer and then put
this on because this can cling to some
dry patches but I don't find that it's
overly matte overly drying which I can't
appreciate I love this in combination
with the original fit me I feel like it
is my dream foundation because the
original fit me is super super dewy
which I like but it's so do me that
sometimes it's like oh hello much
together it creates like such a natural
finish I love it and it actually lasts a
really long time on my skin the only
thing I don't like about this is that I
oxidized on me this is 120 and I find
that when I'm done with my makeup it
looks a little bit darker than my skin
so I have to like bronze and stuff and
no I'm gonna talk about concealers I
have discovered two amazing concealers
in February I really have been loving
this little guy this is the Urban Decay
Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
this is a new product to Urban Decay I
bought mine at Sephora and it looks
identical to their Naked Skin Foundation
and on
it's pretty much the same thing with
like a little bit more coverage it
smells exactly the same like paint and
it feels the same as in the sense that
it's super lightweight on the skin but
it has really really good coverage I
don't know I really like it I love the
applicator that it's like a doe foot but
it's flat on each side so it's easy to
go like boom little blue flip it over
and go boom boom boom yeah I like to mix
two colors this is light neutral but I
feel like it's too dark for underneath
my eyes and then I have like fair
neutral which is the lightest one but I
feel like it's too light underneath my
eyes so I like to mix the two but I'm
mentioning this because I love the
coverage it gives yeah it doesn't feel
heavy on my skin whatsoever which I
appreciate it does crease a little bit
but if I set it right away but if I set
it right away then it does not crease on
me i I just I really love it it feels so
natural and then my other discovery that
I really like is the master concealed by
Maybelline now this is a thick
consistency like you feel it and it's
thick and you would think like oh no too
much but it's not as soon as you put it
underneath your eyes and you blend it
out it does feel lightweight but it
gives you like full-on coverage like the
coverage on this is really good I like
it
it covers dark circles really good
coverage I'm very very impressed with
this I don't know if I like it more than
my Maybelline fit me but for something
that has a lot of coverage from the
drugstore and doesn't feel heavy I would
go for this this one is a little bit
thinner this one's a little bit more
natural than this one but for those days
where you got like huh this is good this
video is getting really long but I just
I haven't filmed in so long and I miss
you guys
so another favorite has to do with my
under eyes as well and it is the first
day beauty I do the triple remedy this
stuff is so good
it's
instantly brighten de-puff and smooth
safe for sensitive skin this is just a
product that comes out and it's that
ceremony color which is great you can't
say that can you which is great for dark
circles like the blue underneath your
eyes if you put like a salmony color on
top like a peachy concealer it
counteracts the blue and it hides it
better so that's basically what this is
but I like to use this on days that I
don't wear makeup or I'm gonna use very
very very minimal makeup but it is so
good in the morning I just squeeze like
a drop underneath each eye and then
twist it over and use this metal part to
smooth out because this metal is like
very cooling on the skin and it just
feels so nice it gives your under eyes
that cool feeling
but then the salmon color kind of hides
your under eyes a little bit and at the
same time it hydrates underneath your
skin so you feel like more it fresh and
like more youthful underneath your eyes
I know that seems really stupid but this
little triple remedy is really good I
highly recommend it
okay we're almost done on our exposure
so my next favorite is a nail polish
favorite and it is this one by L'Oreal
and it is called masked affair this is
the only nail polish I didn't wear a lot
of nail polish in February but when I
did it was this guy this came out with
their Christian Grey or like fifty
Shades of Grey collection which I still
see on display and this polish blew me
away
like I bought it and I became obsessed
obsessed it's a true holographic nail
polish like true holographic like very
true if you don't if you want to see
what this looks like on the nail I have
pictures of me wearing it on Instagram
so you can see like the true colour it
doesn't look like it's gonna be super
holographic in the bottle but it is I
kept looking at my nails the entire time
that I was wearing it of course I'm not
wearing it right now I'm actually
wearing Essie's pedal pushers but I
loved it okay so two more things they're
not really makeup related this is
haircare this has changed the way I feel
about my curly hair which is so crazy I
never thought that
and love something for my curly hair so
much cuz I hate to wear my hair curly I
hate it but this is the real deal curl
charisma this is a rice amino and
avocado leave-in defining cream
vanishing cream for curly to wavy hair
this is the best leave-in cream I have
ever used on my curly hair hands down I
ordered mine at Sephora calm it's
amazing it has no silicones no parabens
no phthalates no mineral oil and no
synthetic fragrances no artificial
colors and it promotes superior curl
definition reduces frizz enhances shine
moisturizes and softens it has avocado
oil quinoa rice amino acids and I back
this up 100% usually when I want to do
my hair curly I have to apply a leave-in
conditioner like a leave-in cream and
then apply mousse on top I have
naturally really frizzy like I don't
know
Cuban hair I guess my dad's hair super
super curly like Prince and I got his
hair but this is the first leave-in
conditioner that I've ever used that
doesn't that actually tames my frizz I
put this on my entire hair and I scrunch
it up like if it was mousse but it
doesn't get hard it doesn't get crunchy
it leaves my hair super shiny super soft
yet it is frizz free and my curls are a
lot more bouncy and I just actually
enjoy wearing my hair curly now that I
have this than I ever did before okay so
my next favorite or my last favorite I
should say this is my last favorite and
it's an empty little bottle this is the
L'Occitane a lot of this is not an
English almond shower oil well shower
oil with almond oil yeah this stuff is
incredible I first saw this in
California when I was at Sephora and I
saw like the big tub the 16-ounce and I
was like
that's a lot of money I'm not buying
that that's expensive and then I saw
this little guy at the register like in
the front when I went to paint and it
was only eight dollars is scary at first
because it says it's a shower oil so you
feel like you're gonna rub oil all over
your body but that is not the case
whatsoever it may look oily but as soon
as you put it on your hands it doesn't
feel really weight it was a weird accent
it doesn't feel oily but the second that
you mix water with it like the second
water touches it it turns into the most
luxurious foamy amazing like bubbly
shower thing in the world it transforms
into magic I swear it's magic I use this
especially to shave my legs because I
don't use shaving cream because it just
makes my skin so soft that I love
shaving my legs with it
I leave the shower and I'm like yes I
feel like a million dollars it's no joke
the best shower product I've ever used
on my body like when I in terms of
cleansing my body I love it so much that
I went on Sephora calm and buckless
sixteen ounce and i've already dented it
majorly now at this point i do think
it's worth the money even though it's
expensive it's worth the investment
because i just i my skin feels so nice
and i love taking care of my skin it's
so good and it's so good that Danny
loves this like Danny uses this in the
shower which is so strange he doesn't
really use his axe that much because he
loves this so much in fact I had taken
out of the shower to place here to use
in my favorites video and Danny was like
hey why'd you take that good stuff out
of the shower and I was like oh it's
good I even told Danny's mom one day
when we were like a little hotel I was
like here you need to shower this it's
so good and as soon as she opened the
door I knew she had used it because the
beautiful scent like just released from
the shower and I was like how good was
that like I make everybody try this the
scent to me is number one like I love it
so much but the scent makes me love it
ten times more it smells like a
delicious almond but like not a wee
like nutty kind of waiting like a almond
like delicious like almond paradise but
I'm so glad that it's mine huh
those were my February favorites I hope
