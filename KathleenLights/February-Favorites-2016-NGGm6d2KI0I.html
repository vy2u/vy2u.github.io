my February favorites these are products
I've been loving in them in the February
I don't want this video to be too long
but you all know it's gonna be and I'm
gonna start off with brushes because I
have a few to share with you guys I
rarely ever talk about brushes in my
favorites video but this month I have
like a lot so the first pair of brushes
I want to share with you isn't exactly
like a specific brush but moreso a line
of brushes and they are the wet and wild
brushes now aside from the Real
Techniques brushes I think these are the
best ones at the drugstore
they aren't labeled with a specific name
which is the only thing I don't like
about these but they are labeled like on
the actual packaging that you buy this
like the little slick I ended up getting
all of them and I just love them so much
and they are all under like five dollars
I don't think there is a brush in this
line that is more than five bucks and
that is crazy considering the quality if
you guys saw my huge drugstore hits and
misses video that I recently did I do
not like the new Revlon brushes and
they're like $10 $14 each for the face
brushes it's ridiculous and they shed
they're not my favorite save your money
and get these these are so much better
and so much cheaper so I didn't think I
would love this brush as much as I do
this is the morphe 44 brush and it's
amazing for foundation it's really big
so if you are someone who likes a
smaller brush to apply your foundation
you're not going to like this but
because of this shape and like how dense
it is it's so great to just buff into
your skin and you get like an airbrushed
look in in no time I use the today for
my foundation I literally pumped it on
this and then I just buffed it in and I
did my whole face like in a minute it
was crazy I really really really love
this I've been using it for like two and
a half weeks and I cannot get enough of
this this is also a pretty recent
purchase for me but I had to mention it
because I am completely in love with
this this is from the Sephora Pro brand
or the Sephora Pro line of brushes and
this is their foundation number 47 brush
it looks really similar
to that like Marc Jacobs foundation
brush where it's long on one side and
then it kind of slants down I love this
for my under eye concealer
we're just saying a lot because I love
my Sedona lace 217 but I've been using
this ever since I bought it and it's
amazing the shape just gets right
underneath your eyes and it just blends
the concealer so nicely and then my last
favorite brush of the month has been
this bad boy right here and this is the
NYX number 2 brush this is so good for
bronzing I bought this on the NYX
website I'm not sure if they're in store
I haven't really seen them in store yet
but I haven't really gone anywhere
recently it looks like a giant fan brush
but obviously it's a lot thicker it's
like not a fan brush but you know what I
mean because of its shape it's perfect
to bronze of your face I used it today
to apply my bronzer and you could even
contour with this if you like a really
diffused soft contour if you're not into
that sculpted look this is awesome it's
great quality it doesn't shed on me it's
just so good you go NYX it's a great
bronzer brush moment okay so this next
thing is so cool I love this this is
from the brand formula X and it is that
there delete all and it's a five finger
nail polish remover so this is nothing
new like a lot of nail polish removers
look like this but I loved it so big
that you can put your entire hand in
this but when you open it you can't see
it but it has like five little holes
that you just put your fingers in and
you I have no nail polish on I'll show
you so you just put your fingers in and
then you move your fingers around and
then all of your nail polish is gone I
promise you this takes my nail polish
off in seconds it's crazy I haven't
tried it with like really chunky
glittery nail polish because I don't
like using these kinds of things with
those kinds of nail polishes because the
glitter kind of stays in this but for
regular manicures dude this takes it off
like this and you get all your fingers
in there so it's like you're removing
your nail polish so fast
I hate removing nail polish it's like
sitting there with your acetone this
stuff it does it so quickly and I don't
find that it dries
my kneels every time I go into Walgreens
to buy like nail polish remover I always
use non acetone but even though this
does have like the acetone in it it
doesn't dry out my nails I mean it's not
super moisturizing by any means but it's
not crazy dry I really love this this
makes doing my manicure so much easier
because I don't go to a salon I do it at
home so I appreciate this so much
I got to give a shout out to some
colour-pop lippie 'he's the first one
the first one is Lumiere - this is their
ultra matte lip it's the liquid lipstick
I'm wearing today but I mixed it a
little bit of maca magenta I believe
that's what I mixed in I don't remember
and I just did that one
I put it back what anyway it's a really
beautiful Mavi purple shade and I love
it I love the pictures you guys have
been sending me on Twitter I've been
retweeting a ton and I've just been
wearing this up coast of Costa head and
then my other favorite I have been
loving magic wand this is their ultra
satin lip I have a full lip swatch video
I will link it down below on their new
formula it's the ultra satin lips and
this is probably my favorite formula of
anything colour-pop has ever created
and that's a statement because I love
their lippie stix this is the best color
pop product it's so great this is the
one I've been wearing non-stop this one
is in magic wand I've been wearing this
one in like my no makeup makeup days
it's such a pretty everyday nude shade
this is the best formula ever if you
guys are not into the ultra matte lips
this is what you need to get they aren't
transfer proof base like they'll smear
they'll transfer they're not as long
wearing but they're still fabulous like
they do last a long time anyway I love
them a little bit overblown I love it I
have to mention this eyeliner because
even though it's been a favorite since I
was like 16 years old I've been using it
so much more recently I kind of forgot
about it for a little bit but I've
rediscovered it and I love it this is
the Mac eye Kohl in the shade Costa
reach it's the best eyeliner Mac has in
my opinion I wore it all throughout high
school and it's just the best if you
have green eyes or if you have hazel
eyes or
if you have like really light brown eyes
and you want to emphasize them this is
the eyeliner you need to get this makes
green eyes 20 times greener it's
incredible it just really really
emphasizes the green in your eyes so
even if you have a little bit of green
go pick up Costa reach by Mac because it
is like a life-changing ichael so creamy
and it just your eyes it just makes them
go the highlight I have been using all
month long is from colour-pop this is
their super shock cheek in the shade
smokin whistles this is the highlight I
am wearing on my face right now just
this I don't have any other highlight on
my face this is the highlight I was
wearing in my awkward boy stories cat
chats video a lot of you guys were
asking me like what is on your face it
was this I always have the makeup I'm
wearing in my description box by the way
like if I'm filming a video where I
already have makeup on it will always be
in my description box like what I'm
wearing whisper was my all-time favorite
color pop highlighter but I think I like
this one even more because it just
complements my skin tone so much when
I'm not self tan it's beautiful it's
like a mix between a white a pearl a
pink a champagne it's I love it I just I
love it I love it so much my next
favorite is a concealer I bought off of
Amazon because I don't think we can get
this brand in the States pretty positive
we cannot this is from the brand
collection and this is their lasting
perfection ultimate wear concealer 16
hour wear I bought mine in the shade Oh
fair one this concealer is no joke this
is so full coverage at least on me like
when I apply it I have to blend it out
almost immediately because it's so full
coverage but it's not thick or
disgusting I will say though if you have
dry under eyes like me you will need to
use like an eye cream before like a
moisturizer of some sort because this
can be a little bit drying it's okay I
mean I wear eye cream anyway it's so
great I really love this especially for
the price so good if you can get
collection in your country or if you can
find it on Amazon this lasting
perfection
concealer is the business this is a
weird product I didn't think I was gonna
like I thought it was a little bit
gimmicky to be honest it was sent to me
this is the Smashbox insta matte
lipstick transformer basically what this
is it's pretty much to make any lipstick
you own matte
now I'm not saying to throw on a super
creamy glossy lipstick and then put this
on it probably won't make it matte my
favorite way to use this is with my
lippy stick and Taurus
I love this so much but if you're really
really familiar with the matte lipsticks
from colour-pop they're not like super
matte they have a little bit of
creaminess to them which I really like
but sometimes I want it to look extra
extra matte I will just take this
product dab some on my finger and then
just apply it like I'll start dabbing it
on my lips and like instantly it looks
seriously mad now it doesn't turn your
lipsticks into liquid lipsticks like if
it's a lipstick that transfers this
doesn't make it transfer proof or water
proof or anything proof it just
mattifies it okay so I want to talk
about complexion products and the first
thing is my Manic Panic dreamtone
flawless foundation color corrector I
have mine in the shade virgin which says
whitest white in parentheses I have been
using this to light in my foundation and
I completely love this now a lot of
foundations in my collection that are my
summer color and I can't really use them
in the winter but now I can so I use my
foundations a lot more often thanks to
this guy I bought it off of Amazon
wasn't like super pricey or anything I
think it was like ten dollars I believe
and I've just been using this with so
many foundations it's amazing one of the
foundations I've been using it with is
actually my next favorite this is the
Milani conceal in perfect two-in-one
foundation and concealer I have mine in
the shade light beige this is too dark
for me I bought it online so I was just
winging it but with my dreamtone
foundation by Manic Panic it gets the
job done I'm so surprised that I like
this as much as I do with my skin type
you guys know I have really dry skin I
didn't think I was gonna like this this
is a matte foundation and it's really
thick it has full coverage which I don't
mind the full coverage but I usually
stay away from thick matte foundations
but this is not cakey on my skin
have to use a beauty blender if I use a
brush it does look a little bit too too
much too found like makeup II but with a
Beauty Blender it just it's so beautiful
it lasts all day the only thing is I
don't like it's a little bit tacky when
you apply it so I do have to set it this
is a foundation I do have to set but
that's okay I really love the bottle I
love the pump I really really really
like this I don't know why but I've just
been gravitating towards it and I find
that it looks so beautiful on the skin I
think you'll like this if you have oily
skin or normal skin and maybe if you
have dry skin you'll like it
I do but I don't know why it's just I
think it's beautiful another face
product I really want to mention is this
bad boy right here
this is the Clarins UV + HP
broad-spectrum SPF 40 sunscreen multi
protection tint anti-pollution oil-free
in the shade light it has a lot of thing
it has a lot of words on this I bought
this at Sephora and I really just wanted
a tinted moisturizer that wasn't dewy
like that wasn't super glowy or do but
you guys know I do like that finish but
sometimes when it's hot outside and I
don't want to put on foundation and if
in Miami it's really hot here recently
it's been cold which is weird but anyway
it's really hot here I wanted something
that kind of had like a powdery finish
but it wasn't gonna dry out my skin I
was just on the hunt and I finally found
something that I love this has a powdery
finish like when I'm done putting it on
my entire face and I touch my face
there's no tackiness to it so I don't
feel the need to set it which I love
because I can reapply it throughout the
day I have been using this so much I
went to a spa yesterday and I knew that
I was going to be in the Sun like eating
lunch after and I didn't put on makeup I
just put on a little bit of mascara and
I rub this in my face with my fingers
and it was beautiful has sheer coverage
but it gives your face like some life it
evens out your skin tone I put this on
with my fingers as my favorite way to
apply it and it's so easy one of my
favorite discoveries seriously you guys
knew this was coming the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer has been my
favorite bronzer this month this is the
bronzer I'm wearing on my face today yes
smells like a piÃ±a colada like I've
said a million times
but it is a very strong scent but it's
my favorite I think I might like this
just as much as my Physicians Formula
bronze booster which is my favorite
drugstore bronzer I don't I love this
mine is in the shade bronzer it does
come in two shades I thought I didn't
but it does it comes in bronzer and
light bronzer and the bronzer shade is
pretty light like this is pretty light
so I can't imagine how light the light
bronzer shade is they need to come out
with a darker shade because if you have
like a medium to deep skin tones this
probably won't show up on you which
sucks because I think that it's so good
so Physicians Formula if you're watching
you probably not you need to make this
in a darker shade so we can all wear it
because it's really amazing I know I
have mentioned this in a favorites video
before but I loved it so much that I
have to talk about it again this is the
it cosmetics bye bye pours airbrush silk
pressed finishing powder with collagen
silk peptides and acta antioxidants I
wasn't a fan of the bye-bye pores powder
when he was in the loose tub but this
press version is amazing if all my
powders literally every powder I own
disappeared and I can only keep two I
would keep my RC amino color powder and
this this is like the perfect touch-up
powder in my opinion because the
packaging is great you mean you have a
sponge on the bottom it's perfect for
on-the-go this literally guys I mean I
don't I don't know but this literally
erases your pores like you see them
being erased sometimes I'll put on like
a really beautiful luminous primer and
those kinds of primers don't really you
know fill in your pores they just give
you a really luminous space so when I'm
done with my makeup completely done
I'll just dust a little bit of this
right here where my pores are really
visible and they're gone they're
invisible they just disappear this is so
freaking amazing and then my last
favorite is this so if you follow desi
desi Perkins on snapchat like I do she
had a she was talking about this thing
called the cap re bronzed liquid
something that she used
when she goes like on vacations or like
at the beach or whatever and it's really
glowy and beautiful and that's why she
was on her skin so I screenshotted it
when she was talking about it and I
immediately went online to purchase it
and it came with this like I didn't add
this to my cart and it said enjoy a free
little gift for purchasing or something
it was really weird this is the coop re
coconut oil sugar scrub the brand is
Campari by the way I had never heard
anything about this friend until I went
to go purchase that thing I'm so glad
that they included like a little free
gift because I'm not I don't think I
would have ever discovered this is a
super ultra hydrating oily sugar scrub
so I use this in the shower and this is
perfect for you if you have very very
very dehydrated like dry skin on your
body because it is made with organic
coconut oil so you have kind of an oily
residue I don't want that to scare you
but once you're done like scrubbing on
the dead skin off your body you feel
super like slick it's just perfect I
love it it really gets rid of all my
dead skin but then I don't have to like
put on body butter after because your
skin feels so slick and amazing so I
really really really have been loving
that ok so that completes this video
these are products I've really really
been loving in the month of February
leaving a comment down below your
