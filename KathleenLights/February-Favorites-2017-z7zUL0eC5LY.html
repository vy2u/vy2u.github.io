my cyber e favorites I'm going to be
talking about all the products I was
loving in the month of February I feel
like I have a lot of stuff so I'm going
to jump right in the first thing I just
have to talk about it is my Aquarius
trio with color pop you guys know I
created a lippy stick with color pop
called
Aquarius over a year ago and we decided
to expand the Aquarius range and we
released Aquarius in an ultra matte lip
and ultra satin lip and an ultra glossy
lip so now you can get Aquarius in all
different versions they are different
they're not exactly the same because
that would be a little bit pointless but
they're all like in the same Aquarius
family the one I'm wearing today is
actually the ultra satin lip in the
shade Aquarius which is just a hair more
peachy I really really love it this is
the one that I've been wearing a lot
actually I've been wearing the lip gloss
a lot which is this one and to me this
is literally a lip gloss version of the
lippy stick in Aquarius they're very
very similar just obviously this is a
lip gloss and this one in Aquarius 2 is
an awesome Matlin and this one is a
little bit more different than these
this one has almost like a moly
undertone versus a satin lip that has
kind of like a peachy undertone you can
tell in the packaging but the ultra
matte lip is just a little bit dustier
so depending on the undertone and
depending on formula you like best
I think they're all great and I love
them thank you guys so much for showing
me so much support on Aquarius these are
available on the colour-pop website and
you can get them in a trio and save a
couple of dollars or you can buy them
individually but yes and have totally
been wearing Aquarius all month I'm just
going to go ahead and finish up my list
favorites of the month this next one is
also know it's been a very news month
for me this is the bite Beauty high
pigment lip pencil in the shade Madeira
I have been loving this shade so much I
feel like the bite Beauty high-sticking
and pencils don't get talked about
enough I never really used to use them
all that much myself but when I
purchased this one on the Sephora
website I completely fell in love with
it the only thing I don't like about
these is they never match the color on
the outside like the color doesn't look
like this it's a little bit more pinky
on the outside this looks like a nude
peach but I was
like a very light pinky nude I was
wearing this in my last video when I did
that really black smoky eye and this is
the lip color I paired with it and I
love this so much I just really enjoyed
this formula besides the color because I
really really really love this color I
have a bunch of other ones but this
color is my favorite but besides that
the formula is wonderful it's a mix
between a very creamy lipstick with like
a little bit of a gloss in there it's
like a very shiny creamy delicious nude
it's awesome definitely techniques out
even if you don't like this shade
there's a ton of different shades and I
really just I just enjoy these overall
they're really good another lip product
I've been loving I haven't really been
using these for that long I've only been
using them for about two weeks but I
think these are incredible these are the
elf
tinted lip oil they came out with a few
different shades they send me these for
you have a pink kiss which is my
favorite nude kid coral kiss and red
kids I haven't used coral kiss and red
kiss yet to be honest I have just been
using the crap out of pink kiss I feel
like for a while there a lot of
companies were coming out with like
tinted oil lip treatment and I used to
really love one from YSL which was like
30 something dollars I'm not sure but
these are only six dollars and they are
so good they go on the lips with such a
beautiful shine they are sheer but
they're not too sheers you definitely
see the color when you apply it to your
lips but it's something that you don't
even need a mirror with I mean it's just
like a sheer tinted color and it gives
you that shine of a lip gloss but it's
not sick or glossy it's just like a thin
luminous oil I don't know how to explain
it but it's awesome these have Africa
vitamin E in them and they even have
ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho oil in them I
always get sometimes saying that they
have a hobo in them it looks so high-end
right I feel like this is so above and
beyond for else they feel heavy they
just feel so high quality like the
packaging it's awesome it's definitely
the reason I wanted to try this products
out in the first place so figure I think
the packaging is so nice the only thing
I will say I haven't used my nude kiss
one yet because he's but okay look at
that in broke this is pink kiss and this
is neut kiss it
mincing the doe foot applicator at the
top I opened it and it was gone which
sucks because I was so looking forward
to this new ones but I think it has to
do with the fact that this feels very
you can see it feels very flexible which
is nice don't get me wrong it makes it
like easy to apply cuz it's nice and
flexible but I have a feeling that this
little tip breaks easily because I just
opened my new one and that's it was gone
I did go on the elf website and I
purchased new kiss for myself because I
think these are incredible and I saw
that they were back in stock because
they were sold out for a little bit my
next favorite is something I feel like I
need to talk about because I didn't
think these were going to be that great
these are the Marc Jacobs eyeliner gel
crayons these just happen to be the
matte ones they have shiny versions and
matte versions I prefer the matte ones
but I think the other ones are good to
have a feeling that they completely
revamp them or change the formula
because I recently got a parrot package
from Marc Jacobs with all of their
eyeliners and I had seen them in the
past before but I think they updated
them I think they made them better
because I never really liked them as
much as I do now I always thought they
were just average basic eyeliners but
now I don't know trying these these are
really great they are so pigmented and
they glide on like nothing you just go
like this
Boop and it's on and in the most
pigmented way - it just glides so
effortlessly full color everybody's eyes
are different I know that eyeliners work
differently for different people but
these less on my waterline the entire
day to me these are comparable to the
color pop ones you know I love my
all-time favorite eyeliners colored
liners are the color pop one you guys
know the NYX pledge really are my
favorite black and brown eyeliners or
when it came to color for me color pop
was it they made the best one and these
are coming really close
these are I love them just as much as I
love the color pop ones which is saying
a lot the only thing that I feel makes
these just a hair better than the color
pop ones is okay have you brought an
eyeliner okay you put on eyeliner and
it's very pigment on the waterline it's
very bold and it's very beautiful but
when you finish doing the rest of your
makeup it's kind of faded just a little
bit like in a certain spot because
you've been blending so much in the
lower lash line so there my
the littleness dating and when you go to
apply it again on the water line have
you ever noticed that a lot of eyeliners
when you go to apply a second layer it
will just take off the eyeliner that was
already on your waterline that happens
to me all the time with a ton of
different eyeliners certain color
problems don't do that to me I can apply
multiple layers but a lot of them can do
that for me which I never really cared
about but these don't do that you can
apply it to your waterline like 80 times
it'll stay bold and beautiful it's just
these are amazing I'm wearing this one
on my waterline right now this one is
called fine wine it's a really intense
reddish berry
I am obsessed with these I think they
are incredible and yes they're very
pricey they're high-end and most of the
time eyeliners liquid liners things like
that I don't think they're worth
splurging on but in my opinion I love
these and I would totally go out and
purchase them myself okay so I want to
give a shout out to a bronzer I have
been using a ton since I got it no
matter what browser are used lately I'll
just take this right at the very end and
I'll just dust this around the
perimeters of my face and I just love
the look at gives me this is the new
Milani baked bronzer in the shade dolce
I have always liked the Milani baked
bronzers but they were never my absolute
favorite because a lot of them are very
glittery or just too just too much of a
sheen for me this one is like is a
perfect mix it does have some glitter
veining throughout it but when you put
your brush in and you tap the brush off
it's almost like the glitter falls off
and it doesn't translate to the face but
it still gives you a very soft like warm
glow to the skin but it's very very
subtle I love it I'm wearing this runner
today I did put on my physicians formula
butter bronzer first and then I went in
with this one and I really just warmed
up the skin with this I love the
undertone in this at first I thought it
was going to be just a little bit too
warm for me but it actually doesn't come
off very orange it just comes off very
natural on the skin
I love the formula I love this new
bronzer I think it's their best baked
bronzer yet okay so my next favorite I
was a little bit worried to mention this
in today's video and I'll go into detail
why in a second but this is the NARS
soft matte complete concealer in the
shade of vanilla I have been using this
concealer so much since I got it and I
loved it the reason I was a little bit
I mention it in a video today is because
I actually have a video going up
tomorrow surprise
in collaboration with NARS it is a video
sponsored by NARS you guys know I'm so
open about my sponsorships with you I
don't do them often I do them maybe like
once a month if that and I'm very open
about them always tell you when a video
is sponsored and when NARS
sent me this concealer they mentioned
that they wanted to do you know a
sponsored video with it and when I read
the bottom and I was like soft matte
concealer yeah I'm probably not going to
like that I always test a product out
for at least a week before I do any kind
of sponsorship and I was just blown away
when I was testing this out it's
definitely not the concealer I thought
it would be usually pop concealers like
this are very drying and very matte
except my glossy a one that one is in a
pot and that was actually extremely dewy
but most pop concealers don't work for
me they're usually just too thick that's
what it is they're just too sick this
surprisingly is not sick
it's so lightweight and just goes on the
skin so naturally but it covers up so
much is a full coverage concealer and it
just it just works I love it because I
use this on blemishes but I also use
this underneath my eyes it's beautiful
underneath the eyes I'm wearing it today
and it just covers up my dark circles
without looking 6ke heavy it's beautiful
I don't want to talk about it too much
because there is a video going up
tomorrow I just know that I'm not just
saying that this video is not sponsored
by NARS they have no idea I'm even
mentioning in this video today
I've been using it the majority of the
month really really good okay so let's
talk about some highlights that I have
been loving since I got them these are
the pixie and Aspen or glowy powders
these are two highlights created by a
friend she's a youtuber and she collab
with Pixie and Mo specialties i want to
exceed to release a million glowy
powders and I love these shades I have
been wearing centering these sunset the
most when I got in the mail I thought
this one was going to be my all-time
favorite for sure this one in London
luster because these highlights are
typically would I go for the light
champagne colors but santorini sunset
has been my favorite it's like a gold
but like a champagne gold a little bit
peachy it is the highlight I'm wearing
on my cheeks today it's not glittery
it's not chunky it doesn't look
ridiculous on the face it just looks
really natural and beautiful and I
definitely see
you should check these out because I
have been loving me so much okay so my
next favorite is something that I have
just fallen in love with this is the
laura mercier color powder for cheeks
and eyes in the shade Wynn flush I don't
know what the front of this says joyed
is easier I don't know how to read that
that's not English or Spanish so I don't
know but basically this is the most
beautiful blush I purchased this like
two months ago off of the Nordstrom
website as soon as I saw the color
online I knew if something that I was
going to love if a beautiful light rosy
pink with a peach undertone it's
stunning this is the blush I'm wearing
on my cheeks right now I love this color
and I love that it's so buildable it's
not extremely pigmented right off the
bat it's a color that you do have to
build up but I love that about it
because you can never really mess up
with this blush I've gone in with such a
heavy hand and still gotten a really
beautiful flush to the cheek
I just love it and I know I'm going to
love it even more in the springtime it's
such a beautiful spring blush but even
in the summer as well I'm just going to
use the crepitus I just know I hope it's
not limited edition even though it
probably is I have been loving it so
much
another blush I want to give a huge
shout out to because I have been using
this one as well this is the Milani
powder blush in the shade warm petals
it's one of their flower blushes which I
have a few and I was never really blown
away by them I love them and I still use
them but the color selection was always
kind of boring to me until they released
this one I think this is a new one and
it's stunning it's a really pretty
bronzed and if you look closely there
are tiny little gold shimmers throughout
this entire blush but just give your
cheeks a really pretty bronzed glow I
love that it's a new it's a beautiful
bronzy nude this is going to look so
pretty in the summer time I cannot wait
okay so in February I was really wearing
a ton of different foundations but when
I think of the foundations that I wore
the most or that I was really trying out
the most these two come to mind the
first one being this guy right here this
is the Giorgio Armani power fabric long
wear high cover foundation this is
definitely a splurge foundation I don't
have that many luxury foundations just
because I I feel like a lot of the
luxury foundations I've tried in the
past not live up to their claim I never
thought they were worth the money you
guys know that I don't really like the
luminous silk foundation which is odd
because I have dry skin but it just
breaks down the way too easily on my
skin this one I really really really
love and I thought it was going to be
the exact opposite because anything that
says high coverage and long wearing
usually is ke it's thick it's for oily
skin but this in my opinion I feel like
Kincaid err to almost every skin type I
think if you have like super intense dry
skin you might not like this but I have
dry skin and I find that this performs
really well at full coverage but it's
not cakey on my skin it doesn't really
collect on my dry skin my problem areas
are right here like my t-zone everybody
has an oily t-zone I have the driest
t-zone in the world I don't know what it
is but right here right here and around
my mouth oh my god I'm like so dry in
those areas and I feel like this doesn't
really emphasize that Brenton the primer
I have been using with this foundation
is the Beca first like priming filter I
mentioned that in my last month's
favorite still my favorite primer at the
moment I have been wearing it non-stop
it's so hydrating so I put that on
before I put this on and I feel like
that makes a really big difference and
it lasts a really long time on my skin I
noticed that at the end of the day my
makeup has invaded that much it stays in
place I know it's incredibly pricey but
if you are willing to splurge if you're
someone who's into luxury makeup I know
a lot of people aren't but if you're
someone who is I think this is a really
great one it's also great to mix with
other foundations it's actually a
foundation I'm wearing on my face right
now mixed with the other foundation that
I'm going to be talking about anyways
I'm in the shade 4.5 and I know that I'm
going to use this a lot in the summer
cuz in Miami it's hot so yeah I really
love this I also wouldn't say it's like
a very matte finish I think it has more
of a satin finish it's not it's not
matte like matte and the other
foundation I have really really been
liking is the number seven list and
luminate foundation I haven't even
worn this in a video yet this has been
the foundation I've been wearing
off-camera all I've been testing it out
all month I purchased this at my local
Walgreens and this foundation is
beautiful it's almost the exact opposite
of the Armani foundation this one is
very glowy very luminous it's so
healthy-looking it's beautiful on the
skin I'm in the shade of warm ivory and
I feel like this color matches me
perfectly
it has SPF 15 and it says it's supposed
to firm the skin firmer even skin with a
youthful glow visibly firms lifts and
brightens for more luminous complexion I
don't really notice any firming it's not
something I can tell if you have more
mature skin maybe that's something
you'll notice but for me I really
noticed that but what it does give me is
a beautiful complexion there's something
about it that just looks so natural it
almost makes my skin look plump it just
makes my skin look healthy beautiful
radiant but in a natural way it smells
like overly dewy it's not like wet your
skin doesn't look shiny at all it smell
like slippy or that gooey it's just a
natural glow it has enough coverage I
would say it has light to medium
coverage
it's hypoallergenic and I have been
loving this so much I mix these two and
that's the combination that's on my face
right now and I love it a couple more
things to talk about I know this video
is a million years long I wanted to give
a shout out to these are gel falsies
these are the one one three
these are the lashes I'm wearing on my
eyes today and these are the lashes I've
been using non-stop I recently purchased
some faux mink lashes from ardell that I
have been testing out and they're really
good too and also from kits the brand
kiss recently came out with faux mink
lashes that look really nice and really
promising I purchased a ton also but for
the most part in February and even
before that I have just really been
enjoying the 1 1 3 lashes from ardell I
love that they go from short to long
kind of like their demi wispies but
they're even longer than that they're a
little bit flirty err it really just
gives you that like elongated cat eye
look but I think it gives you a
beautiful eye shape I really really love
these I know I did not film a tutorial
on this look or anything I just sat down
and started playing around with like my
pinky reddish eyeshadows and I wanted to
do a video on it but then I thought
Cathleen you have a hundred warm
cranberry looks on your
and nobody's going to want to see it so
I did it somewhere okay super class and
then we are done I have to give a shout
out to that suspensive I released a
limited edition birthday nail polish for
my birthday which is this guy right here
called des Princes and it's a nail
polish I'm wearing on my nails it's the
nail polish I've been wearing for like
two months if you look back on all my
recent videos this is the nail polish
I've been wearing I love it it's still
available but we are almost completely
sold out which is crazy to me thank you
so much for the constant love and
support that you've been showing pale
polish it's so it's so much harder than
I thought it would be to start a brand a
lot of steps go into this and thank you
so much for showing love and for saying
such sweet things about the formula and
just for saying such sweet things about
the brand overall it makes me feel so
happy and just so proud and I hope you
guys are proud of Cael polish too and I
can't wait to see what it becomes thank
you guys for leaving such beautiful
comment so I have been loving this nail
polish is what I've been wearing
non-stop it's a really opaque glitter
has kind of like a champagne undertone
it's a little silver a little gold but
it has these tiny little rainbow flecks
all throughout it and I will link it
below where I put like what I'm wearing
and stuff I will link this nail polish
below in case you're interested I cannot
wait for you guys to see the spring
collection oh my gosh I I cannot wait
and then my last favorite is actually a
skin care product this is an eye cream
this is from the brand used to the
people I have never heard of this brand
before but I just recently discovered it
on the Sephora website I have been using
this for about two weeks now and I love
this this is the age prevention super
food eye cream it has kale allÃ´ allÃ´
allÃ´ sunflower oil and trip peptide but
I don't know what that means but I have
been using this eye cream every other
night before bed my favorite holy grail
I cream is the Kiehl's
midnight recovery i i've spoken about
that in the past i still use it that eye
cream to me is top of the line you see a
difference it like really really helps
my under eyes it's amazing but this i
have been using it for just pure
hydration and
it's incredible I wake up the next day
with my bags feeling kind of like plump
almost they feel so smooth and just so
nourished I don't know it's amazing
makeup and concealer just goes so nicely
on top of it because my under eyes just
feel so incredibly hydrated now that
I've been using this if you have dry
under eyes like I do and I would
definitely recommend this eye cream to
you I don't know if you would like this
if you have like super oily skin but for
me who has very dehydrated skin this has
been really helping my undereyes so yeah
