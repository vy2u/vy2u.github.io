my February favorites these were
products I was loving in the month of
February I'm gonna try to go through
these products as quickly as I can and
by the way I'm sick oh my god Kathleen
you always sick
yes I know I honestly thought I was
gonna miss this one like everyone in my
family all my friends they were all sick
like these past couple weeks and I
wasn't getting sick I was like yeah for
once in my life then I woke up yesterday
morning with a super sore throat my nose
was stuffy everything is nice and
clogged so I have a cold
of course I'm gonna go ahead and jump
into my favourites but before I do want
to mention if my skin looks really weird
and it's blotchy it's because it is my
tan is fading and I can't get all of it
off I tried scrubbing the shiz out of
myself last night but it's like in that
transition you know where things look
really weird anyway
the first guy I want to shout out is Dan
suspensive 26 this is my newest birthday
polish every year on my birthday whoa
it's the second year but every year on
my birthday I want to release a DES
offensive because I feel like all of us
here know that phrase and we say it all
the time and I don't know how that
correlates to my birthday in any way but
this year this is what that suspensive
looks like I love it I have it on my
nails right now it's the perfect nail
polish to wear on top of any nail polish
it's such a beautiful iridescent
ethereal orgeous glittery nail polish I
can't even describe it it's so so nice
and we still have some available I mean
compared to how many we ordered we don't
have that many we don't have that many
left I ordered more of this one that I
did of Decimus of 25 because I feel like
we sold out of that one pretty fast so I
really wanted to make sure that everyone
could get their hands on this but yes it
is still available it is limited edition
once it's gone it's gone forever I
really mean whatever all right so I have
to talk about this powder I have been
using it so much since I got it and I
have a whole drawer full of powders but
recently this is just the one I have
been reaching for out of all my loose
powders because I'm
got time for loose powder and I will use
pressed powder but whenever I've been
using loose powder this is the one I've
been using it's the Maybelline fit me
loose finishing powder and I have the
shade fair light this is such a great
baking powder I usually don't really
bake my face because I have very dry
skin I guess because my skin is so dry
my lines are showing up a lot sooner
than I thought they would you know it's
been a struggle I've been talking about
it a lot but Foundation has just been
sinking into my smile lines and
Foundation will also sink into my
forehead lines I make a lot of
expressions I have my whole life so
those are the two main areas I like to
bake also underneath my contour I never
baked under my eyes because I have dry
skin and that just looks really crazy
but I have been using this to bake those
areas and this is such a great powder
for that because it doesn't emphasize my
dryness and I love that this is also
great all over setting powder I use it
all the time to set my entire face and
it doesn't emphasize my dry skin it
looks so nice it looks flawless on the
skin
such an amazing amazing powder from the
drugstore I was really blown away by it
not initially when I first tried it I
thought it was like okay but the more I
used it the more I realized well I love
it so much
alright so I want to talk about a few
makeup brushes all from different brands
but I have been loving these brushes so
much I've been using them a lot kind of
like off camera two of them are actually
very new I've only been using these for
like a couple weeks these are the new
color pop brushes and I have to say I am
so impressed with their second release
of brushes way more than I was with
their first launch like my small fluff
brush came out with the first launch and
it's like the best highlighting brush
known to man but a lot of the other
brushes were like and to me I wasn't
completely in love with the entire range
but their new brushes that they sent
over I really really liked them all of
them are great but there are a lot of
winners I have really been enjoying
these two brushes mainly this one this
is the F 13 brush I really love that now
they included the name of the brush on
the actual brush they didn't have that
before I love that this is such a great
versatile brush you can use this for so
many different things it's so fluffy
it's so soft it's not stiff at all if
you want a really
nice contour this is gonna give it to
you it's a super super super precise you
can also bronze with this you just got
to use this side and you get like a
really nice bronzer application you can
highlight with this but my favorite way
to use this brush is actually with
powder and not with powder like this I
love using this with pressed powders for
example I've actually been using it a
lot with this this is actually another
favorite of mine so I'm gonna skip over
these brushes really quick and talk
about this little combo this is an oldie
but a goodie it's the face glow in the
shade natural by girl lactic and it's
pretty much just a luminous powder I
guess it would be considered a highlight
but it is so natural I wouldn't I
wouldn't call it a highlight really
similar to the essence be my highlight
powder that I love so much you could
actually use this brush with that
instead of this if you already have that
but I've just been using this powder
more because my friend Gaby she's a
makeup artist she recently used this
like on my entire face one day when she
did my makeup and I kept looking in the
mirror the whole night like wow my skin
looks so good and she was telling me how
this was the only thing she had done
differently from other times when she's
done my makeup and it just looked so
nice so I've been doing that a lot even
though I've had this product forever
I've just been using it so much more now
so I'll just take this brush dip it into
this and then I'll kind of just sweep
this around my entire face literally all
over my face mainly on my cheeks
forehead chin but I pretty much put this
everywhere it gives me such a beautiful
healthy glow I've had this forever and I
don't know why I ever stopped using it
this is pretty old so I'm actually gonna
pick up another one it's so luminous but
in such a natural way I have just
finished go into it so into this brush I
just love how it applies press powder it
has so many uses like I totally 100%
recommend this brush and then this one I
don't look as much but I've been using
it so much just to dust off my baking or
to add powder underneath the eyes this
is the f9 a lot of smaller stippling
brushes can be a little bit stiff and
just not flimsy enough but this one is
really really good and I actually like
it a lot more than their new f-14 which
is like the big stippling brush I feel
like these kinds of brushes you can get
them anywhere this one is like okay to
me I still use it but I really like
their little stippling brush and then
I've been loving these eye brushes one
of them is from Wet n Wild and then
these two are from LC cosmetics
this one from Wet n Wild I use it in a
very specific way sometimes I'll use it
underneath my eyes if I really need to
buff out a color because it is a very
stiff tiny it looks like a pencil brush
but it's more of like a little just
stiff dome but I do use it underneath my
eyes like that sometimes but the main
way I use this is to pop on my highlight
on my inner corners I think it's because
it is so stiff and so densely packed
that whenever you pop this on your inner
corners whatever like highlight or
whatever eye shadow you're putting down
looks so intense I freaking love it and
then these LZ brushes I really love I
feel like they really are unique I don't
have many brushes in my collection that
look like this this one is the L 13 and
I'm pretty sure this is like a lip brush
but I use it on my eyes as a pencil
brush all the time and it is so skinny
and it's so precise and love this to get
near the lash line like I'm talking
about like right there underneath the
lash line this is so precise it's
awesome for a liquid liner as well
because it is so skinny I just I love
this brush and then I love this one as
well this looks like a combination
between a regular flat shader brush and
like a Mac 217 like one of those classic
blending brushes this is like a combo of
both which is what I love about it
because I love using this to apply color
all over my lid like a wash of color for
example like I'm gonna do like a matte
brown smokey eye all over my lid I will
apply the brown with this it'll look
amazing it'll be beautiful and then I'll
just twist the brush a little bit and
start blending it into the crease and it
buffs out the color so nicely and it
really does blend the eyeshadows so well
so I feel like it does multiple things I
love the length of this I love how dense
it is I love this brush okay so I have
two highlights to talk about and they're
both collabs with influencers which is
kind of exciting the first one being the
highlight but I have not stopped wearing
I haven't been able to put this down
this is the Anastasia Beverly Hills I'm
raising highlight it's the highlight i'm
Razzie created and it is gorgeous this
is one of those formulas that isn't a
powder I mean it is a powder but it's
not powder really there's no fallout in
this look at this normally any other
highlight would just be like this one
doesn't do that not that that bothers me
or anything like
I have a powdery highlight but I just
wanted to mention that this is such a
beautiful undertone because it's a gold
but it's not like a yellow gold it's not
like oh that's a gold highlight I feel
like those kind of highlights only work
well on someone that has a very warm
complexion but this highlight can be
worn by pretty much everyone I feel like
even if you're very fair you're still
gonna get use out of this because it's a
gold that doesn't really have a base
color all that much so it honestly just
looks like a sheen on the skin and then
I feel like even if you're deep it's
still gonna look like a beautiful golden
glow I love this highlight I feel like
she nailed it so highlighted wearing on
my skin and it looks so natural on the
skin you can build it up to make it look
really intense and crazy but even then
it doesn't look texture II or thick or
anything on the skin it really is a
beautiful formula regardless of how you
feel about I'm reezy because I got so
many comments on my am racy video
everyone is entitled to their own
opinion I truly genuinely like her and I
genuinely like this highlight like on
another level this is so good Anastacio
you guys killed it is amazing and then
my other highlight favorite is something
I didn't think I was gonna like as much
as I do and I've actually been wearing
it a lot especially since I got my tan
this is the artist Couture diamond glow
powder in the shade lip peach which is
in collaboration with jackie ina
this is so nice i didn't purchase
LeBrons because i thought it was just
gonna be a little bit too bronzy on me
but when she released lip peach I'm like
hmm I feel like that one might work for
me and it totally does I feel like this
would work on so many different skin
tones it doesn't have a strong base
color or anything like that it doesn't
look like a stripe on the skin it
honestly looks like a beautiful glowing
peach oh it looks incredible you know
what I'm just gonna add a little bit to
my face right now you probably won't be
able to tell on top of this highlight I
have so much of it on but oh my gosh
this is so incredible guys like you have
no idea this is so pretty this is like
the perfect night out on the town
highlight I know I always say that but I
don't know what else to describe it as
it's like a nighttime delicious
highlight it looks so pretty it's so
smooth it goes on with such a nice
there isn't a lot of glitter - this is a
shimmer but it's not chunky or just
unnatural on the skin it actually looks
just so so beautiful I highly recommend
this maybe not if you're like Snow White
like very very fair but it would also be
a beautiful blush topper like this just
looks good all over your cheek I don't
know it's amazing
speaking I'm amazing a few weeks ago I
did a full face of essence makeup it was
like a first impressions and I fell in
love with this little guy this is the
essence keep it perfect makeup fixing
spray this will transform whatever
makeup you have underneath it is a very
dewy setting spray like it makes my skin
look so glowy
I honestly recommend just using two to
three pumps because if you apply too
much you will look the wet but I love
that it's so affordable and I love this
formula it's so nice it doesn't make my
makeup last longer my Milani one extends
my makeup a little bit more but I just
love the finish it gives my skin you
know what I might try using this with
the new Marc Jacobs shameless foundation
because I saw Katie's video and I saw
that she hated the foundation until she
set her face with fix+
and I was like hmm I might try that out
with this guy because I just love how
this makes foundation look I just love
how this makes everything look and this
is so cheap so she okay so I want to
give a huge shout out to this little eye
shadow quad I've only used this three
times but the three times I've used it I
love it I think it's such high quality
this is the Thrive cosmetics focus eyes
shadow palette and this is the shade
number one I think they have another one
they might have like a number two but
this one is just a quad of just like
your warm eyes shadows this honestly has
like a full look right here you have
your highlight shade you have your lid
shade you have like your outer corner
shade and then you have like a deeper
smokier shade the quality of these
eyeshadows are seriously like and
honestly I've just been so impressed
with Dr Cosmetics their mascara blew me
away their bronzer is not one of my new
favorite bronzers and not when I tried
out this quad I'm so impressed and this
is such a great brand I love what they
represent I love their purpose I love
that every time you buy a product they
give one to a woman in need it's just so
awesome and it's even
when the product is just as awesome I'm
actually wearing this all over my eyes
today I do have one shot over my dream
Street palette I have shooting star all
over my lid but I have this as my Bravo
and I have these two smudged really
close to my lashes and I love how creamy
and smoky these colors are and they
blend like a dream they're so pigmented
and buttery and it honestly is the
perfect little quad and you could travel
with this because the mirror is awesome
on this guy I just super super impress
with this okay so I have been testing
out this concealer the entire month of
February this is the makeup revolution
conceal and define full coverage conceal
and contour I have mine in the shade c6
and the reason I purchased this is
because everyone and their mother was
saying that this was a dupe for the
Tarte shaped tape concealer and I think
I'm the only person on this planet who
doesn't think it's a dupe the only thing
that's similar to me is the doe foot
applicator which is giant just like the
shape tape like the packaging is very
similar but in terms of formula the only
thing I find that similar is that this
isn't very Creasy not greasy Creasy my
Tarte shape tip concealer doesn't really
crease underneath the eyes this one does
crease a little bit more but I've tried
so many other concealers at the
drugstore or even high-end that crease
really bad and this one is pretty good
when it comes to that but besides that I
think that this one has less coverage in
the shape tape and I also think it has
more of a natural finish like this one
has a kind of like a dewy or finish I
wouldn't say it's a dewy finish but it's
not as mad as my shape tape and I don't
know if that's just me like how it works
with my skin type but to me they're not
dupes whatsoever but with that being
said this is still a really great
concealer I feel like it lasts all day I
like how creamy it is and I actually
like that it looks a little bit more
dewy like I like the natural look I
actually love using this without setting
it just kind of like tapping out the
creases a little bit around my eyes and
leaving it just like that like on my no
makeup makeup day so I have really
really really been enjoying this
concealer I'm wearing it right now and
my shape tape does have more coverage in
this like my dark circles are peaking
through a bit but it's so good
especially for the price like you could
not beat it speaking of dark I have been
so impressed with these chrome paint
shadow pops and I know that this is not
like anything new there are a ton of
other brands that have
I think that Giorgio Armani has like
those eyes to kill shadow pots that are
very similar to this but these are
obviously more affordable than Giorgio
Armani and they're amazing but this one
in top yot is my favorite it is the most
beautiful reflective like champagne
color ever it is gorgeous this is what I
have on my inner corners right now and
you want a blind thing in your corner
highlight like literally blind thing
that people gonna be like woah I'm gonna
call this obviously that's a lot of
money just to highlight your inner
corners but you can use this all over
your eyes it is such a beautiful
eyeshadow I love using this as a halo
effect like for example I'll put on my
entire eyes shadow like a nice smokey
eye and then I'll get a little bit of
this and just pop it right on the center
of the lids and it takes my look from
like 50 to 100 really really fast it's
just so good and honestly this will last
you to the end of time like it'll die
and expire before you finish it up so I
think it's worth the money
so next up I have two lip products I
want to share with you guys one of them
is the Catrice lip foundation pencil and
I forget the name of this one because
they don't have the name on the freakin
but I below they do how did I miss that
you know what is I already had this lip
liner I actually have two I don't know
why I have to but I do and this one says
the name and this one doesn't
but anyway why do I have two of those I
don't know this is to cafe au lait and
it is the most beautiful nude lip pimp's
I like this because it's really really
creamy and it just glides on the lips
and it's awesome to really overdraw your
lips with this everything you put on top
of this just like works I really like
this lip liner and it's so affordable
it's from Catrice and then my last
favorite for the month I don't have more
lip favorites because honestly most of
the days I've been wearing that lip
liner with like moonchild gloss or I've
been wearing my god by lip balm or my
color pop collabs like my recent ones
but I did want to mention this I did
want to give a shout out to this because
I've worn it three times that's saying a
lot this is the nude Stix magnetic matte
lip color in the shade Joyce I got this
in an Ipsy bag and I haven't been able
to put it down since I got it it is such
an intense color so obviously it's not
every day shade like this is not what
I'm gonna wear to the grocery store I
mean I would I totally would but I wore
this to dinner the other night with
Danny and it stayed on my lips the
entire night and I was eating some
greasy food and this stayed intact all
frickin night and I was just so
impressed that I've worn it a couple
times outside of that and I love it I
love how bold it is I love how matte it
is but it's not super super drying and
it's just such a unique color it looks
so cool
I just freaking love Joyce and yeah
those are the lip products I've mainly
been wearing if I Rory I do want to give
a huge shout out to this necklace though
this is like my favorite necklace in the
world
I call it my Carrie necklace did you
guys ever watch Sex in the City my
sister used to be obsessed with that
show when I was growing up I was never
super into it just because like Carrie
made me want to punch her in the face am
I the only one she's my least favorite
and nut shell but she used to wear her
Carrie necklace like it said Carrie and
it wasn't cursive it was beautiful I've
always like longed for a necklace like
that I mean they're totally popular a
lot of people have businessman eclipses
but my sister actually got me this one
for my birthday it says mama which is my
nickname I've told you guys like a
million times but mama is what my entire
family calls me and I'm obsessed with it
she has her own jewelry line I know I've
spoken about this a few times on my
channel but she can make anything you
want like everything is customizable if
you want it to say booger-eater your
necklace can say booger-eater whatever
floats your boat
I love how dainty it is but how personal
it is as well I've also been wearing my
old English letter a lot - it's like the
Kate I've been loving that one as well
