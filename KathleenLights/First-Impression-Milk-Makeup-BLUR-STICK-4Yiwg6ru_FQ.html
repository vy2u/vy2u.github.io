a first impression I haven't done one of
these videos in a while they're not
videos I tend to do very often because
my mind changes like this I will
completely hate a product and then two
weeks later I'll love it I'm so strange
when it comes to trying out new things
so I always like to test out a product a
few weeks before I give you guys a
review before I come on here and do like
a review style video but this product
intrigued me so much that I had to do a
first impression today we are going to
be talking about the milk makeup blur
stick I have not tried this on my face
this is the strangest product and I've
never seen anything like this at least
well maybe not recently so if you don't
know milk makeup is kind of like a newer
brand to me they recently started
selling them at Sephora they're a very
trendy hip cool innovative new brand
they come out with things that I've
really never seen anybody come out with
when I first got this in the mail I was
so confused because I thought it was a
stick foundation since so many brands
are coming out with stick foundations
but then when I applied it to the back
of my hand nothing was coming off and it
just felt so weird on the back of my
hand but then I noticed that my hand
felt really smooth it looked a little
bit more perfected so weird so I looked
into it I did a little bit of research
because this was sent to me I do get PR
from milk makeup I just want to put that
out there I'm gonna read to you what
this is what it's supposed to do on the
milk website this isn't available in
Sephora just yet but I think it will be
very very soon it is available on milk
makeup calm already so it claims to be a
universal face filter silicone free blur
stick minimizes the appearance of pores
and fine lines to create a smooth matte
finish that part scares me a little bit
invisible mat coverage blurs pores and
fine lines on every skin tone swipe for
a smooth finish and makeup that doesn't
budge silicone free and oil-free formula
won't clog pores so skin can breathe and
yes so far on their website they have
pretty good reviews it just comes in one
universal shade and you get one whole
ounce in this product the only thing
that I can remember that's pretty
similar to this is something that
benefit came out with a couple of years
ago it was in a stick and it would I
feel like it was very similar but I
don't remember liking that at all I
don't typically like pore filling
primers I
like my skin to look matte so I'm a
little bit nervous
this product is $36 which is pricey for
a primer but a lot of people say they
like it on days where they're not
wearing makeup they just put it all over
their entire face and it kind of makes
their skin look nice and filtered I
don't know let's see let's see I feel
like this intro is a million years long
already I'm drinking I always drink
black coffee it's my favorite way to
drink coffee and this is totally
watered-down but the coffee from Dunkin
Donuts I've got to say not me I mean
it's not terrible it's not my favorite
has nothing to do with this video okay
nobody cares
okay so I figured the best way to do
this is to apply it to one side of my
face only I'll zoom you in see if we can
tell a difference and then I'll apply my
makeup off camera and I'll let you know
how I feel about it I also leave a
little note in the description box for
you guys letting you know if it really
did make my makeup last longer I mean it
says on the website that makeup doesn't
budge so I'll leave a little note and
let me know if that's true okay let's do
this
so when you open it it comes with this
little clear cap on the top I'm assuming
you should keep that just so that the
product doesn't dry out because I feel
like it might okay so oh my gosh this
feels so matte it's so strange it's so
crazy how I feel nothing coming up on my
face it smells funny but not bad funny
oh my gosh I don't even know when to
stop like how much is too much because
it feels like nothing is coming off on
my face is there a limit okay I'm just
gonna Pat that in just so that it sinks
into the skin as best as possible I
don't know if I applied too much if I'm
not touching my face I don't feel this
at all and it's not that it feels tacky
it just feels silky almost silicone like
but there is no silicone in this product
so it's so strange
it feels like a typical pore filling
primer but way more lightweight I think
I didn't put on moisturizer right before
I filmed this video which maybe I should
have I was just afraid to I normally do
but add a little bit more right here
okay I have like pores right here and I
just need a little more this side of my
face looks a little bit more matte and
it looks a little bit more perfected
like very slightly obviously there's no
coverage in this product so you can
still see everything but it does look
like it has a slight blurring filter on
top of the skin my pores are definitely
filled in on this side not as much as my
dr. Brandt pores no more or maybe my
first impressions are horrible I don't
know my pores are definitely filled in
okay so I'm looking at the viewfinder
and I cannot really tell on camera but
this is the side with the blur stick my
pores are just much more filled in than
on this side I don't know if you can see
that right here is where you can see my
pores the most and I feel like it looks
a lot better on this side they look more
filled in and it looks much smoother in
person the only thing I'm a little bit
concerned about is that maybe I'm not
the best candidate for this first
impression because I wouldn't say that
my pores are very large my issue is more
texture dryness I mean we all have pores
and I definitely prefer my pores to be
filled in and this does the job but to
compare before and after I feel like you
guys won't get the full experience with
me but so far I really liked it it did
fill in my pores my skin feels nice and
smooth it's not tacky at all now as I'm
touching it I feel like it sank into the
skin a little bit more I'm just going to
apply it to this side it's so crazy
because as you're applying it it feels
like it's doing nothing like if nothing
is coming off the only thing I will say
is that I feel like it makes my skin a
little bit red at first I have very very
sensitive skin and tugging at my skin
like this
it's probably not the best kind of
impress that it isn't feeling very dry
on my skin I am applying away too much
I'm so sorry I don't know how much
you're supposed to apply so I'm just
like going ham I think if you apply too
much it can ball up and you can see like
the excess product building up on your
face so don't apply too much take my
advice as it sinks into the skin it
becomes a little bit more powdery so
yeah so far so good I will give you my
final thoughts
here in a second I'm just going to apply
the rest of my makeup and then I'll let
you know how makeup applies on top but
yeah I'll just go finish my face and
I'll be right back
okay so I have already finished my
makeup I did something really simple I
have a few things to say about this now
that the makeup is on my face there are
some pros
there definitely are some cons I
definitely like this product I think it
is really good the only thing I will say
is that I think I used too much I was
like swiping that on my face for like an
hour and I definitely think I shouldn't
have done that because it completely
made the foundation break up around my
nose there are patches on my nose
I honestly feel like the next time I use
this I probably won't apply it to my
nose and if I do I'll use a very little
amount I don't like the way a foundation
sits on the nose with this product at
all because I feel like it had too much
primer too much of this product
underneath I also noticed that it made
my makeup look a little bit more matte
than it usually does I used the ex1
invisi wear foundation today and this is
one of my favorite Holy Grail
foundations and like how it applied on
top I didn't find that it was too drying
but I did notice that it made my
foundation look a little bit more matte
than it typically does I think products
applied nicely on top the only thing
like I said is I believe I applied way
too much because in certain areas of my
face I noticed that the bronzer skipped
a little bit and I felt like it made my
foundation a little bit difficult to
blend here in the temples but again I
really do think I applied too much next
time I use this I'm definitely gonna use
less I have been wearing this look for
about two hours now because I shut off
the camera I did my makeup and then I
went to go eat and I was doing stuff and
Terry I'm two hours later so I feel like
it looks pretty good I think as a pore
filling primer and as a blurring product
I think it's really good I will say my
favorite way to use this will probably
be on its own you can apply this to your
entire face it'll give you like a soft
blurring effect and then you can just
apply some concealer underneath the eyes
and then on blemishes and you're good to
go so my conclusion is that I think it's
pretty good I don't want to rate it yeah
I don't want to give you guys a grade
because like I said this is something
that I'm gonna have to use multiple
times maybe with different foundations
work with it a little more but so far on
first impressions I am pretty impressed
I don't think this is the most amazing
product I've ever discovered but I think
it's innovative and it's cool let me
know if you try this out I think it
officially launches on the 9th of this
month but I'm looking on the website and
you can already add it to your cart let
me know if you try this out what you
think of it it's a little pricey do you
think it's something you would want to
look into let me know thank you guys
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye I don't know it
looks like a stick family where's the
little top this has a little top I'll
also note also right a little bit what I
also leave a little bit what am I saying
so you're just supposed to pores no more
might fill in your pores a little bit
more what the dr. Brandt pores no more
might fill in your primers where's my
coffee at man Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
