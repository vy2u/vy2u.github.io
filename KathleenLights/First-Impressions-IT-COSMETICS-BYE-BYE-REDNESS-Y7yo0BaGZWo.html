a first impressions on the it cosmetics
by by redness neutralizing correcting
cream
I have never used this on my face before
so today is going to be an actual first
impression and basically I'm just going
to be applying this on my face for the
first time show you how it applies and
then wear it throughout the day and see
how it lasts throughout the day which is
why I currently have no makeup on really
quickly little before I get into the
demo I want to tell you what this
promises to do on the it cosmetics
website it says that the bye-bye redness
is a red neutralizing and correcting
cream that completely cancels redness in
your skin from view rich in peptides
hydrolyzed collagen and anti-aging
technology by my redness camouflages
redness and any red tone skin
discolorations from rosacea blemish skin
irritated skin skin --skin sun damage
scars age spots and all of that good
stuff it also claims to give you perfect
coverage that will never crease or crack
so I'm very interested in seeing how how
it lives up to that claim this also has
old meal aloe and avocado in it and it
says that it's going to soothe your skin
and give you a youthful glow as well so
let's get into the demo for the sake of
this video I'm going to be using the
Sigma angled kabuki f-84 to apply it i
will typically use my Beauty Blender to
apply to apply my foundations but I know
that a lot of people have these style of
foundation brushes so I'm going to be
using this oh I also didn't add any
primer or any concealer or anything just
to see how well this covers and the
reason why I didn't use a primer
underneath this or why I'm not going to
use a primer underneath this is because
I want to see the lasting power on this
product all on its own because
foundations typically tend to last a
pretty long time with primer so I want
to see how well this works on its own
I'm just using the cap the product
that's already in the cap and I am just
going to dab this in and start applying
it
okay so it's crazy pigmented like
I'm kind of surprised it feels very very
smooth
it doesn't feel thick or sticky at all I
have this like purple blueish vein right
here I don't know if you can see it
where it kind of looks like I have a
mustache and I hate it it's like a very
intense vein that goes down to like my
neck oh it's like a really long vein and
usually I like my foundation I usually
have to use concealer to cover that
because it's crazy so hopefully let's
see how this covers my veins and my
spots of redness this seems to be a
pretty decent color match considering
it's one color it doesn't come in
multiple colors I don't know if I've
mentioned that it comes in one color and
it's just supposed to fit to everyone's
skin tone
okay so this is one coat of the bye bye
redness I did add just a little bit more
on my cheeks right here where I get the
most redness I'm actually pretty
impressed it didn't cover up my dark
circles a whole lot but that's to be
expected I have pretty deep purple dark
circles so I would have to use an
under-eye concealer regardless with any
foundation I would use but what really
surprised me is that it didn't cake up
around my nose I have very dry skin and
typically 90% of the Foundation's I use
cake up around my nose and it didn't at
all
it doesn't feel sticky it doesn't feel
heavy ow and it has really good coverage
and you would think that it would be a
little bit heavier and it isn't it
didn't cling onto my dry patches which I
am very happy about because that was my
biggest concern was the fact that I
thought it would cling on to some dry
patches so I think that this would work
really well for dry skin I also think it
would work really well for normal skin
and believe it or not I think this would
work pretty good for oily skin as well
because it kind of dries to a powder
finish and but it's not a drying powder
finish I think that this would honestly
fit so many different skin types so far
so good I'm pretty impressed already I'm
going to go ahead and put on the rest of
my face makeup and I will be right back
okay so I have already put on the rest
of my face makeup and I don't know for
some reason in the viewfinder in the
foundation looks too dark like it looks
darker than my neck but in person in my
mirror it's a pretty spot-on match I
would say I don't know why it looks
darker in the viewfinder
I don't know so for my initial first
impression I do like this I hate the
feeling of having a sticky face or just
feeling like I have foundation on that
heavy feeling drives me absolutely crazy
and right now I don't feel like I have
foundation on which is crazy since I
didn't even
set it with a powder so yeah it is now
one o'clock in the afternoon and I will
get back to you in a couple of hours to
see how the Foundation has held up
okay so it is now 514 which you probably
can't tell because of a picture in the
back but I've had this foundation on for
about four hours I am pretty impressed
with this foundation so far to me it
looks exactly like it did when I applied
at four hours ago I am just insanely
amazed at the fact that it's not cakey
usually I get a lot of cakiness right
here and around my nose and it is
awesome um the only complaint I have so
far is that around here it has creased a
little bit like I have to very faint
lines right here from smiling but
honestly I'm pretty sure that's
happening because I didn't put a primer
on I'm pretty sure if you are to put a
primer underneath this there wouldn't be
like any creasing or settling into fine
lines so that's usually what a primer is
supposed to prevent anyway but honestly
it's doing pretty good it doesn't seem
to be fading off in spots or anything
like that
ah I like it so far I really really like
this so far so yeah I will check back in
with you guys in about another four
hours or so at the end of the night to
tell you my final thoughts and more in
depth of what I think of it so yeah I
will get back to you guys
okay so it is now 9:20 at night it's
been about eight hours since I've had
this foundation on and I've got to say I
am obsessed it looks pretty darn good
it has faded a little bit on my cheeks
but that's typical for me because my
foundations always tend to fade there
first I didn't do anything crazy today
either
I was outside for a little while with
Cornelius and I went out to eat with
Danny and it painted my nails cuz they
was looking great gray earlier today and
some like that so I didn't do like any
crazy activities but yeah so really
quickly I want to kind of go through the
pros and cons of this foundation and
then my final thoughts so let's start
with packaging I actually really love
the packaging of this of course it would
probably be a little bit better if it
came with a pump like if it came in a
bottle and you would just pump it but
honestly I really like this if you are
worried about like sanitary reasons that
you don't want to dip your brush into
this you can just probably like scoop
some out with a little spatula put it on
the back of your hand and then put it on
your face um but I like the fact that
it's easy access and it's pretty small
and it's travel friendly this fits
anywhere so I do like the packaging I
was a little skeptical at first when I
found out but this was only in one shade
I don't see how this could possibly fit
every skin tone in the world but it
seemed to match mine pretty good and the
good thing is is that it's not too
yellow and it's not too pink it is
literally the perfect uhm the perfect
color I think it kind of transforms to
match your own skin tone because I like
my foundations to look a little bit more
yellow and I find that this just kind of
it kind of goes with my skin tone so I
love that so in terms of coverage I
would definitely say that this is a full
coverage foundation you definitely just
use very little and blend it out where
it's just medium coverage or you could
really
build this sucker up to be like
intensely full-coverage I found that
this didn't cake up at all no peg enos
whatsoever so it is very very buildable
so if you have a lot of breakouts on
your face I definitely think this work
for you because it is insanely buildable
without looking cakey I would say the
finish of this foundation is like a
satin finish because it isn't dewy by
any means but it's not 100% matte if you
were to set it with the powder I would
assume that it would be pretty matte but
if you leave it alone
it does set to like kind of like a
powdery set and type finish which is
really nice actually so that's awesome
so really quickly I'm going to talk
about the cons of this product even
though there aren't many at all first
cotton being of course its price this is
pretty pricey it is $32 but like I said
before a little goes the longest way and
this would last a pretty long time so
honestly I'm not one who spends a lot of
money on foundations and I do think that
this is a hundred percent worth it it is
worth every single penny also around the
five-hour mark I noticed that it was
kind of settling into my pores um but
again that could be because I didn't use
a primer so yeah those are the only cons
I found with this product I definitely
think that this foundation needs a
primer underneath it but besides that I
mean it held up very well like I still
think it looks really good I can go on a
few more hours with this and still think
it looks good my personal opinion is
that this isn't an everyday foundation
if you have really problematic skin and
you have a lot of redness and a lot of
acne then definitely I would definitely
say this is an everyday foundation for
you because it feels so natural but
because of the coverage and because it
can be like a really full coverage
foundation I would say that this is
perfect for special occasions or nights
out and stuff like that I don't think
this has SPF because it doesn't say
anywhere on the jar or on the box so
that would be really good for
photography
cuz it doesn't it doesn't give off a
white cast but if you want to wear it
during the day or anything like that
then you would probably want to put SPF
underneath oh I forgot to mention that
it cosmetics is cruelty free says it
right here on the box cruelty free and
it has a little bunny on it so that's
awesome so yeah that's pretty much
everything I have to say about this
foundation I hope you liked this first
