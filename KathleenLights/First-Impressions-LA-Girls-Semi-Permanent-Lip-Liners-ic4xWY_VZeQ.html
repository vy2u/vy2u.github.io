to be reviewing the LA girl endless
semi-permanent Auto lipliner
long-lasting and all-day wear that's
what it says right here and this video
is actually going to be a first
impressions more than a review because I
am going to be wearing this lip liner
throughout the entire day and at the end
of the day I'm going to check back in
and we can see if it lasted if it's
smudged if it faded basically just check
the wear time because having a claim
that says semi-permanent long lasting
all-day wear that's a heck of a claim
and I have six different shades to share
with you guys there are ten shades in
total but I only have six to share with
you today and there are just basic lip
liners but what I really like about them
is that they aren't pencil lip liners
they are the kinds that you scroll up as
you can see it's easily scrolled up and
easily scroll down and I really really
love lip liners like this because they
do not dry out my lips and they don't
tug at my lips I am someone who isn't a
huge fan of lip liners in pencil form
even though I really do love the Mac
pencil ones I think that they're not
drying but so many companies that have
pencil lip liners are pretty drying on
my lips if you don't already know la
girl is a really affordable brand you
can get la girl cosmetics at la girl
usa.com and it is a cruelty free brand
these lip liners retail for five dollars
each so very very inexpensive and if
they do everything that they claim they
do then that's an incredible deal you
guys know I usually do lip swatches of
everything lipsticks and lip glosses but
when it comes to lip liners it's a
little bit more difficult to do lip
swatches because they're meant to stay
on your lips all day and it's just a
hassle to have to take off lip liner put
it back on take it off and put it back
on especially this one because that was
my intention to do lip swatches but once
I put this on my entire lips it was kind
of hard to take off and I was like oh no
I'm not gonna be able to swatch all six
of these on my lips because my lips are
gonna bleed by the end of this because
it was difficult to take off which is a
good thing so unfortunately this is
the only one you're going to see
swatched on my lips but the other ones
I'm going to quickly swatch them on the
back of my hand so the one I have on my
lips right now is called natural and it
is the lightest shade that I have it
seems like it's the lightest shade that
they carry and I know it looks really
dark on my lips but that is because I
have naturally pretty pigmented lips
colors tend to look just a little bit
darker on my lips than they do in the
actual tube but I want to say that you
can go light handed with this and it
won't look dark on the lips I just put a
bunch of this on my lips actually like I
ran it over my lips a bunch of times I
put layer after layer because that's
usually what I do with a lip liner and I
wanted to fill my entire lip with it you
can get like a soft color like I don't
know if you can tell you can get a
softer mouth look or you could press
harder and get like a darker color which
is kind of like the color I have on my
lips is because I pressed really hard
this one right here is called pink
parfait it is like a hot pink with a
fuchsia undertone really really pretty
these are so pigmented you could use a
really light hand and get like a soft
look or just press a little bit harder
and get a more intense color this one
right here is called true red and it's
just your basic red lip liner could
never have too many red lip liners and
this one is gorgeous
it reminds me of Ruby one is called dark
plum and it's more of a very kind of red
it's not as opaque as the other ones I
don't know if you can tell but still so
beautiful that berry color is perfect
for the fall this next one right here is
called nectar and it's kind of like an
orange you read Oh a very orange II read
I haven't tried these on my lips yet but
look at this color that is a beautiful
orange shade so pretty and then the last
one I have to share with you is called
berries and it is a deep wine red color
this one right here it's actually very
similar to dark plum only a little bit
more purple here and the other one is a
little bit
more red but very similar okay so I
lined some on the back of my hand to do
the smudge test okay so some of it did
smudge I mean I almost burned a hole in
my hand from how hard I was smudging
there but some of it did smudge as you
can see I mean I'm not going to be
rubbing at my lips that hard or I'm not
going to be rubbing on my lips at all
throughout the day I don't think it is
now 2:00 in the afternoon and I will
check back with you guys later on
tonight after I eat dinner and all that
good stuff hey guys
so it is a now 9:45
I don't know if we could see it in my
Fallsburg and this lip liner has been on
my lips for almost eight hours and it
looks really really good I'm so
impressed I mean it did get patchy I
don't know if you could tell like right
here and it did fade within my lips as
you can see it's like not on the inside
of my lips anymore it's just on the
outside but I made a soup for dinner so
my mouth was like all wet with sooo
penis while I was eating yeah it has
patchiness and it looks a little crusty
up close but I mean it's been on for
almost eight hours so that is incredible
so yeah I give these bad boys a big
thumbs up
mainly because they're so inexpensive
they're five dollars each and they last
a pretty good time this is the only one
I have used on my lips before so I don't
know about the rest of the colors but
I'm pretty sure they're all the exact
same thing so they're very very long
wearing but definitely check these out
if you're looking for a long wearing lip
liner that's inexpensive so yeah I guess
that's it
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
