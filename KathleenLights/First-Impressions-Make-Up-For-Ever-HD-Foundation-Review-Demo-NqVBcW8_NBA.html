first impressions on a foundation and it
is on the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
I have been wanting to try out this
foundation forever so today I ran this
before and I got a sample of it I didn't
want to go ahead and buy the foundation
yet just because it's so little
expensive and I wanted to check if it
was good or if it works for my skin
before I went and spent the 42 dollars
on it so that's why I got a sample the
color I got is n 123 and I'm going to be
applying it on my face right now just so
you guys can see what it looks like I
actually haven't applied it first
impressions I really hope I love it
because I've heard amazing things about
it I'm one of those people who is like
on a constant hunt for the perfect like
photography type foundation I know this
is gonna sound crazy but I love
foundations that don't have SPF like
every time I hear the foundation doesn't
have a skip I'm like ah yes I know that
that sounds weird but foundations with
highest PF in them tend to give off a
white cast and photographs and I usually
only wear like a full face of makeup
like with you know a lot of foundation
at night time anyway so I don't need the
SPF so yeah this foundation contains no
SPF and it's supposed to look amazing in
photographs HD and all that good stuff
so let's see by the way excuse my makeup
I know it seems a little bit much but
it's a long story I don't even know what
happened I'm just gonna pop this on my
face and I hope it matches me I'm kind
of like very tall not very but I'm a
little bit more tan on the rest of my
body than I am on my face you could tell
like my face is a little pale I'm going
to use my Real Techniques expert face
brush to blend that out
Oh thinking might be too dark myself
Tanner has worn off so I mean this will
probably match me perfectly with my self
tanner and full effect
yeah yep I don't think it matches
this actually doesn't it's way too
yellow I can good like really lady at
Sephora really okay so the color is
obviously off um I have to go back and
get a different color probably the shade
right under this I was kind of in
between both of them but you know she
was like get this one this one matches
Seymour
okay so color issue aside please let's
try to ignore that for the rest of this
video I love that this does not have a
scent like it's crazy cuz it doesn't
really smell like anything it doesn't
even smell like foundation like most
foundations have that foundation you
smell this doesn't I'm going to go ahead
and put on the resume like face makeup
and then I will be right back to tell
you what I think about it okay guys so I
just put on the rest of my face makeup
if you're wondering what's on this face
it will be listed in the description box
everything from my eyes to my face okay
so thoughts on the foundation I was
gonna do like the whole um updates
throughout the day how lasted and all
that stuff but I was at work all day but
I still really wanted to film this video
so that's why I'm doing it right now but
I am about to go out tonight go out on
the town with Danny and stuff so I will
also write down in the description box
how well it lasted throughout the night
if you are interested but anyway back to
the foundation I am obsessed with this
and I knew right off the bat from the
moment I applied it on my face I'm in
love I can already tell you that this
could potentially be one of my favorite
foundations of all time just from the
way that it applied to my skin I didn't
get cakey around my nose I didn't get
any cakiness in my t-zone at all and I
know that some people get oily in the
t-zone which is so bizarre to me because
actually like everybody gets oily in the
t-zone and I'm over here like Sahara in
my tea so my t-zone is so damn dry and
usually foundations cling to my t-zone
like no other but it didn't I didn't get
cakey around
in between my eyebrows it went on
flawlessly there's absolutely no scent
at least I can't detect any scent which
is amazing I love my Urban Decay Naked
skin foundation but every time I put it
on my face I feel like I am painting
some Martha Stewart home paint on my
face it's it's in its mouth so that's a
big plus there is no SPF so you know
what let's test how it looks in pictures
there is no SPF which means there won't
be like that weird white flash back in
photography so I definitely recommend
this foundation if you're going to go
out with your friends at night clubbing
or something like that where you're
going to be taking a lot of pictures
because you will have that weird white
cast since there is no SPF so it's
amazing for photography it's more like a
satin finish if you were to powder it it
would definitely be matte but it's not
flat like it's not a flat matte where
you look like powdery and just like
unnaturally matte this is not
unnaturally matte I did add my highlight
because I can't you know how I am about
highlights I just I love the glowy skin
but even without adding the highlight I
still felt like my skin looked like a
little glowy don't get scared if you
have oily skin I even think that this
would work for you with oily skin just
set it with a powder and it would still
be like a nice satin finish because I
don't know I don't like that super flat
a natural matte that's just me
like I almost want to wake up in the
morning and go to Sephora and buy this I
love it that much to me the only
downside I find with this foundation so
far is its price its $42 so I mean it's
a pretty penny it's not you know it's
not cheap but as of right now it looks
worth it I'm gonna wear it throughout
the night and I will update you in the
description box how well it lasted
tonight so if you're interested in like
longevity just read the description box
I'll let you know baby doll baby though
I don't I don't know what that was
things just come out of this like like
vomit and
stop by the way I felt like my face
products went on this foundation
beautifully like when I was putting on
my bronzer it went on like super like
perfect like not streaky at all my blush
went on my sleeve my highlight one and I
stayed like it was a very good base for
my my blush in my bronzer so that's
always good and also there's no
tackiness like what like there's no
tackiness I mean I can feel like I'm
wearing foundation but it's nothing that
annoys me so yeah that was my quick
first impressions on the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation I give it a huge up
to thumbs up so far like I'm loving it
right now I'm loving it I hope you
