if you can tell by my robe and my wet
hair but I was just sitting at my desk
about to put some makeup on and I
remembered that a bunch of you guys
wanted a first impression on the Urban
Decay Naked skin foundation that I
hauled in a previous video so that is
what I'm going to do for you guys today
okay so this is what the packaging looks
like it comes in a bottle that has a
pump which is amazing I think every
foundation should have a pump I don't
know why all of them don't but I love
that this has a pump this comes with one
fluid ounce which is typical for
foundations I got mine in the shade 3.0
which is a more yellow toned foundation
and this technically is in a first
impression okay well it is but it isn't
um I did purchased this a couple months
ago and I got one that was way too pink
for me so I did apply it on my face
realized it was too pink and then took
it off literally less than a minute
later like I was like ah too pink I took
it right off and then I returned it so I
have applied this foundation before but
I mean it was only for like 30 seconds
cuz it wasn't even my color but yeah so
I mean I guess this is technically at
first impressions then ignore me I don't
even know why I'm telling you this
really quickly before I get into the
demo I want to tell you what this
foundation claims to do this on nation
is supposed to blur your perfections for
a flawless finish yet it's supposed to
feel like you're not wearing any makeup
on at all
it's supposed to be weightless and
virtually invisible and it's also
supposed to give you an airbrushed look
with a demi matte finish so yeah okay so
I'm going to get into the demo now
excuse my face I have like really bad
eye bags going on I just haven't slept
and like my eyes are so sleepy I'm kind
of tired I don't know what's wrong with
me but yeah I'm going to be using my
Sigma angled kabuki f-84 brush to apply
this foundation and it says to shake
before you use it it has like it kind of
sounds like a like a bottle of spray
paint
you can hear that like something in it I
guess mix it all up so I'm just going to
pump one pump on the back of my hand and
it is very very very runny like very
liquidy and it smells like paint this
deep it literally smells like paint
doesn't bother me though
okay so this is the foundation on one
side of my face and I have to say that
does cover really well um I would say
it's like a medium coverage foundation
it does cover nicely and it definitely
does feel like I'm not wearing any
makeup on it is a little bit tacky to
the touch but I mean I didn't give it a
chance to let it dry or anything but I
gotta say I am not 100% sold on this
foundation um it's a little cakey on my
dry patches Oh which is kind of
bothering me a little bit but I'm going
to go ahead and do this side of my face
and then I will zoom you in so you can
kind of see what I'm talking about I'm
just going to put another pump on the
back of my hand
I loved it from a distance
it does look airbrush it does um you
know it has a demi matte finish it you
know it does look flawless from a
distance it didn't cover everything like
I have a pimple right here that's still
peeking through enough you can tell I
mean it covered it pretty well for the
most part but it's not like completely
full coverage but it covers enough
I do have que eNOS and between my
forehead and around my nose and around
my mouth and that's kind of usually
right here where the cakiness happens
since my skin is so dry and it gets
really flaky there but even on the top
of my nose right here you could
definitely tell I'm wearing foundation
let me zoom you in okay do you see what
I'm talking about or it's like a little
cakey there and in between my forehead
where you can definitely see that I'm
wearing foundation so that's the only
thing I don't like I have a little bit
of kick eNOS but I didn't use a primer
underneath this I mean I did moisturize
but maybe I just need to moisturize a
little bit more and probably use a
primer in the future so I mean so far I
do like it I'm just a little bit just a
little bit iffy on certain areas but I
have to see how it lasts throughout the
day to make my final thought so really
quickly I'm gonna go put on the rest of
my face makeup and I will be right back
okay so I've just found the rest of my
face makeup and I have to say now that I
have everything on my face yes I do
like it I had to add a little bit of a
highlight because I cannot stand like a
completely matte foundation it drives me
crazy I'm more into luminous kind of
looks
it still is cakey in the areas where I
said it was and I feel like it kind of
oxidized a little bit seems just a
little bit darker than my chest it
matches my shoulders pretty good but it
seems a little bit darker than my chest
but that's not terrible it does in fact
feel really nice on the skin it doesn't
have any tacky weird texture to it which
is a really big plus for me but I'm
still a tiny bit on the fence it is now
12 o'clock in the afternoon and I will
get back to you in a few hours
tell you how its held up okay so it is
now a little bit after 5 o'clock I've
had this foundation on for about five
hours and I have to say it has
definitely grown on me I know that when
I first applied this um it was a little
cakey and that just completely threw me
off I was not feeling it
I mean I liked it but I was extremely on
the fence about it but now wearing it
for a few hours I really really like
this it still is a little bit cakey on
my dry areas but it hasn't gotten worse
and hasn't separated it actually started
to look better as the day went on I know
that that seems really weird but either
I got used to it or it just didn't look
as bad as when I first apply it the one
thing with this foundation is it can
kind of get a little bit streaky so just
make sure you really take your time and
buff it into your skin and I'm sure that
that won't be a problem for you I'm
actually going to end my first
impressions here because I'm going to be
taking off my makeup soon even though
it's only 514 I am just extremely
extremely tired and I don't feel very
well so I am gonna be going to bed just
watching a movie and then just going to
sleep so I am going to end my first
impressions here I think I've worn it
for a good amount of hours to kind of
tell you my final thoughts to talk about
the cons it does have a couple of cons
for me
one being its price it is $39 I got mine
at Ulta and that's pretty pricy for a
foundation another con is it can get a
little bit cakey if you have dry skin I
definitely recommend this to people with
either oily to normal skin I think this
would look absolutely beautiful on you
but if you have a really really dry skin
like I do definitely moisturize your
face really well before putting this
foundation on and I definitely use a
primer I think that if I were to use a
primer under this I wouldn't get so
cakey like I did today but like I said I
hadn't used a primer with this and also
I always add fix+ on top of all my
foundations because this takes away the
cakiness
and I didn't do that
this time just so that I saw how well it
worked on its own so I would say those
are the only cons I do definitely think
that it wears better the longer that you
wear it I know that sounds ridiculous
but I like it a lot more now than I did
when I first applied what really made me
start actually really liking this more
was how beautiful this foundation looks
in pictures I was taking some pictures
of my face and like it just looked
completely flawless and airbrushed and I
was just like wow this looks crazy good
in pictures if you are definitely into
photography and you're looking for a
foundation that just looks beautiful in
pictures this one really does also this
could be a good thing or bad thing for
some people it doesn't have SPF in it
which during the day you're going to
want to add some SPF to your face but at
nighttime I think this is a perfect
nighttime foundation because you don't
really need SPF at night and like I said
it looks beautiful in pictures like I
said in the beginning of the video this
dries to a demi matte finish and it
actually is a really really nice finish
it's not so matte to where it looks kind
of unnatural but your skin does shine
through a little bit and it's it I don't
know it's like a nice matte like a nice
satin finish I really like it so yeah
this product actually turned out to be a
little bit better than I expected
I definitely think that you should
probably get a sample of this at Sephora
before you actually go and spend the $39
of it just try a sample um you might
like it you might not but I think that
the majority of skin tones would really
like this I just have incredibly dry
skin so even dry skin can pull this off
I think I think so thank you so much for
watching this video guys I hope you
enjoyed it and I hope this kind of gave
you an idea whether or not you want this
product please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
