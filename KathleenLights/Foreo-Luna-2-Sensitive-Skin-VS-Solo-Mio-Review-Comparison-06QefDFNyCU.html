your video that should have gone up few
weeks ago I told you guys in a recent
monthly favorites video that I wanted to
compare the foreo luna to for sensitive
skin to the solo meal that I purchased
on Amazon so this whole video is going
to be comparing the two ever since I
bought this a ton of people asked me to
compare it to this guy right here so I
immediately bought it of course and it's
taken me so long to upload this video
because I really wanted to try out both
individual products for a good amount of
time I didn't just want to use it once
and then review it I wanted to use it
for a few weeks so that's why this video
is going up so linked I'm also going to
be throwing in my little review at the
end of this video on this little guy
right here this is like the foreo play I
believe that's what it's called and if
you're interested in this I will tell
you my thoughts at the very end of the
video but for now let's just get started
with the basics so I purchased my foreo
during the vib sale this is $199 which
is why I waited for the sale to purchase
this on Sephora and I was kind of
overwhelmed when I was looking at the
for Yoos because they have a ton of
different ones they have the luna mini
the mini two and then they have one for
oily skin for normal skin combination
skin sensitive skin this is the luna 2
for sensitive skin I picked this one out
because I have very very sensitive skin
I've tried out the Clarisonic and to be
quite honest I do not like the
Clarisonic it's too harsh for my skin I
even tried like the super uber sensitive
brush head and it's just it's too much
for me and I started doing a lot of
research on the foreo and I just read a
ton of great things so I took the plunge
and I bought it and if you have no idea
what this is I want to read it off of
the sephora website so that you guys can
know it's a waterproof cleansing an
anti-aging device for sensitive skin
types that deeply cleanses while
improving the appearance of fine lines
and wrinkles for radiant firm youthful
looking skin
I use this every morning and every night
to wash my face you guys already know I
love this if you saw my monthly
favorites video where I talked about it
it's my favorite I love love love this
home you're supposed to use this for a
full two minutes with
any cleanser so whatever face wash you
have what I do is I kind of wet it I put
it under my sink I wet it a little bit
and then I apply my cleanser and then I
go in like that and you're supposed to
use this for like two minutes what I
love about this is you turn it on okay
it has like a minus and a plus sign here
and that depends on you how you want to
use it if you want a little bit stronger
if you wanted not as strong I have mine
the way it came I didn't really mess
with that too much you turn it on I
don't know if you can hear it you turn
it on and then you start to massage this
into your face and then you're going to
notice that it's going to like pulsate
it's going to like see if it does it you
see it kind of had like a a moment where
it stopped and then it started again
that's when you go to the other side of
your face and then you start cleansing
that side and then it's going to do it a
third time and that's when I cleanse
like my forehead right there right there
did it a third time and then I cleanse
my forehead and then when it does it
again I turn it off and that is how I
wash my face I love that it does that
because it gives you the perfect time
like to wash your face it's set on the
box that it's not great to stay there
for too long because you can kind of
make your skin a little bit sensitive if
you just stay there rubbing your face
for a while with this you want to make
sure you are doing it until it like
pauses and starts over I find that any
cleanser works with this the only thing
I will say if you're going to use an
exfoliator if you're someone who
exfoliates your face do that with your
fingers I find that this doesn't really
work well with exfoliators and anyway so
the back has this like it looks like
kind of like thumb and you're supposed
to use this side as like the anti-aging
side you put your cleanser on this and
then like you rub it on your face when
you're done to smooth out wrinkles and
all that stuff and I'm gonna be
completely honest with you I don't even
look at this side I don't use it at all
maybe I should maybe people really like
that but I just want to clean my face
and get on with my day to be honest I
also don't use the backside on the solo
meal it's completely different they
don't look similar at all but I don't
use the backside so I'm very sorry I
will only be talking about the front
sides I've never tried the original luna
so I can't tell the difference but I do
know that I've read reviews and people
tend to like the luna 2 versus the
original
I can't say enough great things about
this I
noticed an incredible difference with my
skin ever since I started using this I
used to be a huge believer in just using
your hands your hands or your best tool
to wash your face and I still feel that
way honestly this is a very pricy
product I still feel like your hands get
the job done but the Luna 2 for me just
really really gets in there and when I'm
done washing my face my face feels way
softer than when I just use my hands to
wash my face that was my biggest like
the thing I noticed the most I was like
wow my face feels extra extra soft like
the first time I used it I noticed right
away I don't know what makes this one
good for sensitive skin and then the
other ones good for like oily skin and
combo I don't know how they do that or I
don't know if there really is a
difference since I've never touched or
looked at any of those other luna twos
in person with that being said this does
not irritate my sensitive skin at all
while the Clarisonic really did these
little rubbery things let me tell you
that's one really good for my skin it
doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever I
give this like five stars across the
board we all have different skin so I
don't know if this will work for you but
this truly has been working for me I
love it
it even charges for a really long time I
charged it the first time I got it and I
haven't charged it since and I stay
going strong now let's talk about what
you guys are honestly here for this is
the solo mio I bought this on Amazon and
it's from a brand called earthen Beauty
naturals while this is $200 this is only
37 bucks
37 95 I just pulled it up on Amazon it
says it's on sale for 37 95 and it's
originally $100 but I don't know if I
believe that it was ever a hundred bucks
I don't know there's also another one
here on Amazon that looks just like this
that's $18.97 actually all of these
other like foreo dupes are like 18 bucks
why did I pay so much for this one well
the other ones are not called solo mio
so I don't know I'm just giving you my
review based on the solo mio cleanser
and massager that's 37 dollars that's
how much I paid for it
now I will say I really do like this I
think this is good do I think it's as
good
this I'm going to say no right off the
back I don't think it's as good but it's
definitely an amazing alternative I
would definitely consider it a dupe for
sure now maybe the big difference in my
mind could be the fact that this is for
sensitive skin and this one is not maybe
if they came out with a solo meal for
sensitive skin that would be a better
comparison so far from what I see on the
earth and beauty Naturals
account thing here there's only one solo
meal this works the same way that the
Luna 2 works it has the minus and the
plus sign here and you can adjust that
and it turns on and it pulsates the same
way the Luna 2 does the only difference
between the pulsations with this one and
this one is that this one doesn't stop
this one does that whole like pausing
thing that gives you a hey it's time to
switch over to the other side of your
face
this one doesn't do that it stays
vibrating the whole time you're using it
that is the one major con I find with
the solo meal because that's probably my
favorite thing about Poe Luna too is the
fact that it tells me like where to go
so I'm not stimulating one part of my
face for too long but that being said
you could easily just count in your head
like okay 20 seconds and then go over
here to 20 seconds and then another 20
seconds or however long I haven't
actually counted you can totally do that
by yourself in your mind the other con
for me is that the bristles are like the
little rubberized little nubbin things
they're a little bit more rough on the
solo meal than on the sensitive one
they're a little bit thicker these are a
little bit thinner it's hard to explain
I mean they're both rubbery but this one
feels just a little bit shorter and a
little fatter and these feel just softer
hard to explain I find that sometimes
not all the time but sometimes when I'm
done washing my face with this one my
face will just be like a little bit more
red and unusual but nothing major I just
really was like noticing every detail so
that I could tell you in this review but
nothing too crazy but pros is it really
does clean my face really well my face
feels extremely soft after I use this
one - there's just something about the
fact that you're cleaning your face with
like this little vibrating
rubbery thing that sounded wrong well
something about that makes your face
just feel so clean and looks so clean
I've noticed that while using this my
pores just cleaner I will say that I
will go back to this one now though
after I've been using this one and
testing it out I just I simply like this
one more for those reasons that I told
you about but this is still a really
great device and for so much cheaper
like girl that's expensive and I know it
is it's offensive I know even though I
do like this one more if you're someone
who you really want to try the foreo
you're like man I really want to use it
but I just I don't feel like dropping
that much money on a cleansing device go
on Amazon and pick up the solo mio
because you might not even like the idea
of cleaning your face with something
like this so I rather you try out the
dupe before like jumping into the actual
things I still haven't had to charge it
again still working like a charm really
great to travel with fabulous I love
them both so much I hope that was
helpful I know you guys just wanted to
see what I thought about it this was
just as good or what I hope this was
helpful I quickly want to touch base on
this little thing and this little thing
is stupid this is the Luna play this is
limited edition so I don't know how long
these little eggs will be around I have
a feeling not for that long because I
don't really think it's worth the money
this is a booger is $39 like I bought it
to review it like I bought it for the
sake of trying it out just to tell you
guys it's not that great it comes at a
ton of cute little colors I got pink it
has the little on button back here you
just turn it on and you wash your face
with this I saw it in the like checkout
section at Sephora and I was like well
cool and I bought it this is what I used
while I was in Vegas actually bought it
in Vegas the first day I got there and
it's a cool little device I mean it's
nice to travel with which is what I
envisioned myself using this for for 40
bucks it's like it's kind of dumb I
rather spend those 40 bucks on the solo
meal honestly and just travel with this
it doesn't take up that much space but I
only used it while I was in Vegas so I
used it for maybe like five days but
when I went on the actual Sephora
website to read the reviews I was
shocked at what I was reading
this has like three stars out of five
which I'm surprised it has that many
stars everyone says this dies within
like a week which is insane to me
because now that I look at it this is
not rechargeable why on earth would a
foreo come out with something like this
and then not let you charge it so like
what when it dies like what he's
supposed to do throws away it's like am
I supposed to spend like $40 every two
weeks on a little cleansing thing that's
ridiculous someone said I was bummed
when this little guy only lasted half
the time promised and like a bunch of
people said the same thing that this
mind still vibrates like but I haven't
even I barely used this so yeah that
completes this video I thought that I
would give you guys demos at the end of
this video so I'm gonna show you a demo
using the Luna 2 for sensitive skin
which is this guy and I'm also going to
show you myself using the solo mio I
always take off my makeup prior to
washing my face I want to point that out
this video is not over yet wait a minute
I don't use this to remove my makeup I
will take off my makeup with my
Dermalogica pre cleanse and then I will
go in and clean my face with this and
yet there's still makeup left on this
but I don't recommend just going in
willy-nilly like with a cleanser on top
of like a full face of makeup I just I
don't recommend that okay so yeah if you
want to see me using these bad boys in
action then I'm gonna go ahead and show
you that but for now that completes this
video thank you guys so much for
watching it please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video actually I will see you right
now in the devil bye bye okay so I'm
going to show you how I use both the
foreo luna 2 for sensitive skin and the
solo mio this is the foreo and I use
them both the exact same way but I'm
still going to show you anyway so I like
to wet the 4yo a little bit and then go
in with my cleanser and pump I added a
little bit to the bottom but I usually
put them on the bristles yep I put my
cleanser on that and then I add a little
bit more water and then just start
washing my whole eye turn it on and then
I start washing my face and you can see
here that I'm rubbing this in circular
motions on the left side of my face and
once it vibrates I just go ahead and use
it on the right side of my face well
it's always vibrating but once it does a
little pause thing I move to the other
side of my face and
does it again like it did right now I
just do my forehead and I sped up this
process because I'm literally doing this
for like two minutes and once I'm done
cleaning my face I can always kind of
see a little bit of foundation left
there just a little bit even though I
did clean my face pretty well and then I
go in with my face wash and just clean
the actual foreo a little bit I make
sure that there's no foundation left in
there and then I just rinse it off with
water and if any of you guys are
wondering I am using the derma dr.
kakadu c face wash i know that's a funny
name but that's the face wash i've been
using recently that's probably not how
you pronounce it but that's what I'm
gonna go with okay so I use the solo mio
the exact same way just put some
cleanser on it a little bit of water and
then I just use this in circular motions
on my skin the only difference like I
said is there isn't a little vibrating
pause that tells me when to move on to
the rest of my face but that's okay it's
still an amazing cleansing device uh
yeah I think that's all I have left to
say I'm gonna go ahead and stop talking
now and let this video finish on itself
alright
