hey guys so today's video is going to be
my foundation routine and how I contour
and highlight so basically everything I
do in my face that isn't I make up my
primer my foundation my concealer my
bronzer my blush my highlight all that
good stuff now I will say that I don't
think that I do it perfectly and I don't
think that my way is the only way think
of it as a how I not eye hell too but
hopefully you guys get some tips and
tricks on how to do it and I think that
the way that I do it anybody can do it
so anyway I'm just gonna go ahead and
get into the video okay so before I put
on my foundation I'm going to be using
some primer this is the hard candy sheer
envy primer
the foundation I'm going to be using
today is the Revlon Colorstay foundation
this is the one for normal to dry skin
and it's 250 fresh beige my foundation
routine is usually alternate between
these two foundations so I also
currently love The True Match Lumi
foundation and just alternate between
these two mostly but these are great
foundations my favorite way to apply
this foundation is actually with a
Beauty Blender so that's what I'm going
to be using right now I'm just going to
take some on the back of my hand
hate that this doesn't have a pom so I
just put some on the back of my hand and
then I'm going to stipple this stipple
it yeah
like bounce it on my face
I swear this Beautyblender puts on this
particular foundation puts it on like a
dream I swear I cannot use a brush with
this foundation anymore after I saw how
amazing this implies it this foundation
is amazing because it's full coverage
but it is in KP so that's awesome
ok so now I'm going to move on to
concealer and I have really bad
under-eye circles so that's mainly what
I can see I don't really do like spot
concealing especially with a full
coverage foundation but anyway for what
I'm going to use for under my eyes is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I love
this on a day-to-day basis I will
typically wear the maybelline instant
age rewind um dark circle eraser for my
dark circles but whenever I want my
makeup to last a really long time where
I'm going to go somewhere I usually use
this one this is the Pro Longwear
concealer it lasts the entire day and it
does not crease or settle into the fine
lines which I find amazing I have never
seen a concealer not crease before and
this doesn't so I just take a pump of
that one I don't take a full pump just
like half a pump on the back of my hand
really really small a little goes a long
way with this this might even be too
much and I just take my ring finger and
dab it underneath my eyes and then I
bring it down into like a triangle
I know this looks a little crazy right
now like a little bit too light for me
but I'd like my under-eye concealer or
like the area underneath my eyes to be
very very bright and a few shades
lighter than my skin tone but it looks
less scary when I blended it see I have
like a bunch left on the back of my hand
and I don't even need that much but so
I'm just going to take the tip of my
Beauty Blender and blend that in
oh by the way I use nw15
if you were wondering
okay so after that I just take a tiny
bit more on the tip of my sponge like a
tiny bit and kind of put some right here
in the center of my forehead just to
kind of highlight that area too and then
a tiny bit on my chin and my Cupid's bow
okay now I'm going to send my concealer
and for that I always use always my MSF
natural in medium this is my favorite
powder I'm just going to take this Real
Techniques point to the foundation brush
just tap it in there and set my
concealer
now for contouring I use a bunch of
different brushes these are the brushes
I typically use whenever I want to
contour I'll use the Real Techniques
contouring brush this is an amazing
contour brush the Real Techniques
buffing brush and love this for
contouring use the Sigma smile contour
the fo5 my Coastal Scents angled brush
it's really good for contouring too or I
use my Sigma angled kabuki f-84 brush
these are my favorite brushes to contour
I use these all the time for that but
today I'm going to be using the Sigma
angled kabuki f-84 this is just honestly
my favorite brush to contour with which
is why I'm going to be using it in this
video so what I'm going to be using to
contour is actually a blush not a
bronzer this is max harmony blush and it
looks a little red in the pan but I love
to contour with this it gives you like a
really nice natural contour my
suggestion is to contour with something
that doesn't have any shimmer or glitter
in it it's just what's going to look the
most natural and it's not going to look
muddy on your skin if you use a matte
bronzer or blush or whatever you're
going to use so it really helps me when
I contour is I always start from the top
of my ear so you want to start from
right here and just follow the hollow of
your cheek so put your brush right here
to the top of your ear and you feel
where your cheek kind of dents
let's tell you I could describe its like
where there's a hole in your face you
feel like you know you feel like hollows
right here
I remember always start from the top of
the ear and start from back here you
don't want to start your contour from
your cheek right here because that's
know so start back here so just dip it
in and then I'm going to just press it
right here so you can see I kind of
already started the contour so I'm not
going to add any more on my brush and
I'm just going to blend that back and
forth
it's better to start off slope than to
just like pack on a bunch of bronzer and
then you look crazy so just little by
little
and then I'm just going to blend it up
and down a little bit
you want to focus the most product very
close to your hairline and then kind of
drag it down as you blend
okay so I also add some products to my
temples right here close to my hairline
and then I bring it all the way up to my
forehead and I add bronzer all around
the tops of my forehead right here but
usually people will just add some here
add some here on the side and that's it
but I like to kind of bring it up here
as well but that's up to you
I also add some right around here okay
so I'm basically done this is all I do
when I when I'm going to contour like I
said this might be too much for some
people and it might be too little for
some people it's all about preference
now I'm gonna move on to blush I've said
it a bunch of times I'm not the kind of
person that really packs on the blush
that's just me but I do like a little
wash of blush every now and then and for
that I'm going to be using my NYX oh wow
my NYX blush in MA okay so how I apply
blush it's pretty simple you don't want
to take it too far out because that's
where your highlight is going to go so
what I do is the brush I'm going to be
using actually is from Coastal Scents I
don't know what it's called one of my
favorite brushes in the world this does
it all and it's one of those brushes
that applies the blush a little bit more
sheer just gonna dip the brush into the
blush and I'm just gonna add some right
on top of that contour but not too high
so how you know if you're going to go
too high as you feel right here you have
a bone right here which is usually where
your highlight goes it's like the tops
of your cheekbones you don't want to
pass the tops of your cheekbones you
know you've gone too far
once you feel that you're passing that
bone I don't know if I'm making any
sense I hope I am
so just kind of go back and forth and
really blend out the blush not taking it
too high and not covering the contour
just right in between and that's usually
as far as my blush goes I know it's kind
of subtle but that's the way our like
okay and lastly it's my highlight I use
a bunch of different highlights but for
today I'm going to use the Mac
mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
it's a really pretty highlight and my
favorite highlighting brush is this one
right here this is the Sigma type type
hood Sigma tapered highlighter f-35 yep
so what I do is I just dip the very tip
of the brush into the product and run it
on the top of my cheekbone
I like to take some right on top of my
eyebrows right here down my nose
right here
if I'm feeling extra sassy on my
forehead and chin just when I want that
overall glow which usually I do because
I love that okay and then of course my
face is never complete without a little
spritz of mac fix+

foundation routine plus how I highlight
and contour I hope you liked this video
