my makeup right now my eyes and my face
um I did the whole thing for you guys
it's mainly using the Too Faced summer
eye palette and I know that it's the
d'ampton addition I think it came out
last summer I don't know but I know that
there's a palette that looks just like
this I think it's my Tarte or something
like that I just wanted to do like a
really fun colorful look that can also
be pretty wearable I mean I would wear
this I don't know if that's just me but
I would worry
so yeah if you want to see how I got
this eye look and what I did on the rest
of my face keep cool okay so I had to
make this a voiceover because my husband
was in the next room watching family
feud at the loudest possible volume yeah
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to grab my Urban Decay primer
potion and I'm just gonna put that on my
entire lid
now I don't have any face makeup on
because I wanted to do my eye makeup
first
next I'm going to be taking my NYX jumbo
eye pencil in milk and I'm just going to
pop that on my entire lid I always put a
primer under these jumbo eye pencils
because they tend to crease so I
wouldn't recommend putting them just
straight on your eyelid
I'm just gonna go ahead and blend that
out
next I'm taking my Too Faced palette the
summer eye palette and I'm going to be
going into that pink color called plum
area
is a marine cute I'm just going to be
putting that on my eyelid but just
focusing on the inner part of my eye
I'm only focusing that on half of my
eyelid because we will be putting
another color on the rest of the eyelid
so going back into my to face palette
I'm gonna grab that orange color called
coral crush and I'm just going to be
adding that on the rest of the eyelid
I'm also going to be bringing that same
coral crush color coral coral crush
color into my crease
okay now I'm just going to soften up the
look a little bit just to get rid of any
of the harsh lines and I'm going to be
going into my Naked basics palette and
picking up the color naked - and now I
think that I didn't point out the right
color and then realize I did yeah okay
so I'm going to be taking that color
with a little crease brush like this
this is my Ecotools crease brush crease
brush I cannot talk today and I'm just
going to be popping that on my crease
just to soften the look up a little bit
I'm not going to go directly in my
crease I'm just going to go above it a
little bit we still want to keep that
pink and orange pretty vibrant now I'm
going to go into my Mac color added quad
and I'm going to be taking that yellow
color called color added and I'm going
to be putting that into my tear duct
area just to brighten up the look a
little bit
I'm also going to bring it on to my live
just a tiny bit
okay next I'm going to be taking that
same quad and I'm going to be taking
this white color called laundry days and
I'm just going to use that as my
highlight under my brow bone
I'm then going to be taking my NYX jumbo
eye pencil in peacock which is just this
vibrant blue color and I'm going to be
lining my waterline with it I'm not
going to be very precise with this I do
want it to be a little bit messy
next I'm going to go back into my to
face palette and I'm going to be taking
that really beautiful two color called
mermaid and with a small eyeshadow brush
I'm just going to be adding that color
to my lower lash line
this is just going to intensify that
blue next taking my ELF eyelash curler
I'm just going to curl my lashes
and now I'm just going to add my mascara
I'm going to be using a different
mascara for my bottom lashes just
because I like the wand on this one this
is clinics lash doubling mascara and
it's one of those ones that gets very
skinny at the tip and I like how that
works for my bottom lashes now taking a
makeup remover wipe I'm just going to be
cleaning up any fallout okay so that is
it for the eyes now moving on to the
face I'm going to be taking my favorite
primer and just putting that all over my
face
next I'm going to be taking my hard
candy glamoflauge concealer this is a
really heavy-duty concealer and I'm just
going to be covering any imperfections
that are on my face like in between my
eyebrows and around my nose and the dark
spots around my mouth
next I'm going to be taking my favorite
foundation at the moment it is L'Oreal
True Match Lumi and I'm just going to be
putting one pump on the back of my hand
and I'm going to be using my Real
Techniques expert face brush to kind of
buff that into my skin
this is a great foundation for spring
because it is a little bit Dewey and me
that I have very dry skin I love how
this looks on my skin
I'm not going to be adding any powder on
top of this foundation because I do want
to keep it as dewy as possible I want to
keep this look very fresh and fun and I
don't want to mattify it at all this is
my favorite foundation brush at the
moment did I really say that I'm just
adding more foundation on the places
where I get really read throughout the
day I'm staying away from under my eyes
because I will be adding concealer to
that part a little bit later now I'm
just waiting for the foundation to kind
of set on its own even though this is a
dewy foundation it doesn't leave your
face feeling wet or uncomfortable at all
it does set pretty nicely
I'm going to be taking this NYC bronzer
in sunny and I'm not going to do a very
strong contour at all with this look so
I'm just going to take a brush that
gives me more of a sheer application and
just warm up my face a little bit
I have no idea what Cornelius is doing
back there yes that is my dog's name
Cornelius I was a Thumbelina fan as a
child
okay so moving on I'm gonna be taking
that same brush and just wiping it down
and I'm going to be taking my favorite
spring blush of all-time
it is called spring sheen and it's just
this peachy pink I don't know it reminds
me a lot of NARS is orgasm and I'm just
going to be swiping that on my
cheekbones really lightly because this
blush is very pigmented if you just dab
your brush in there and because there's
so much going on with the eyes already
in terms of color I don't want something
so strong on my cheeks
and next I'm just going to be
highlighting my face this is max soft
and gentle and I'm just going to be
taking my Sigma f-35 brush and
highlighting everywhere where you would
normally highlight
how perfect is this highlight I swear I
love it
okay now I'm going to be adding my
under-eye concealer and I know it's
really weird that I do this step last
but whenever I have a very colorful dewy
fresh base I like to add my concealer
last because it just brightens up the
look and I feel like it pulls everything
together
now I'm going to be adding my lipstick
this is max ravishing and it's just a
very corally orange peachy yeah it's
more peachy
I suck at describing colors here it is
right there and I'm just going to be
adding this on my lips I love this color
especially for spring this is the
perfect spring color
and just to finish everything off I'm
going to be taking my mac fix+ and I'm
going to be locking all of my makeup in
and that is it for this spring fun fresh
makeup look I hope you all enjoyed it
and please subscribe for more videos
I'll see you in my next video thanks
