hey guys so today's video is a makeup
tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now it's very simple and girly and
feminine I love it I love looks like
this I think it's perfect for
Valentine's Day if you're going the more
like sweet route I feel like a
Valentine's Day you either go like the
sexy red lit bold look or you go like
the pinky soft feminine look at least
for me I think it's very fresh and very
useful this look is perfect for you if
you're starting out with makeup because
it's very easy if you're a beginner or
if you're just someone who can't be
bothered to do like a crazy dramatic eye
look this is perfect for you and I still
think it's romantic and beautiful for
Valentine's Day so yeah if you want to
see how to get this 100% drugstore slash
affordable makeup look then just keep
watching okay so I've added tape to the
side of my eyes to create a sharp edge
right here so that when we take off the
tape you're going to see like a harsh
line you don't have to put the tape down
if you don't want to you can just hold
like a card up to your eye anyway the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to take this Catrice professional
contour palette and I'm going to take
this shade right here and on my luck see
two to three brush I'm going to use this
color to highlight my brow bone I love
this color because it gives a really
soft glow to the brow bone it's also
really beautiful as a face highlight as
well the few eye shadows I'm going to be
using today on my eyes are going to come
from the pixie and it's duty time
eyeshadow palette is so sent to me by
pixie but you can get pixie products at
Target they're on the pricier side of
drugstore but still more affordable than
high-end brands I'm going to take this
shade right here this is called good
morning and on my morphe e36 brush I'm
just going to start applying this
eyeshadow really really close to my
lashes and dragging it up along the side
of the tape I'm kind of being a little
bit messy with this shadow because it is
the lightest one we're going to put down
I'm going to go from light to dark with
these eye shadow so the first one I'm
putting down is lighter so I'm being a
little bit more messy with it not as
careful the next shade I'm going to take
is this one right here this one is
called brick and on my zoeva 2:37 brush
I'm going to do the exact same thing
only I'm not going to be too messy with
this color I'm going to focus this one
even closer to my lashes then the other
shade I used
now we're going to this shade right here
this is called - - it's a really pretty
like deep purpley brown coat and on my
ELF because we precise pencil brush I'm
going to do the exact same thing only
keeping this one even closer to the edge
of the tape I'm going to take a little
angled brush this is from the brand
essence it's just their eyeliner brush
I'm going to take this deep chocolatey
color right here
this was called off snaps it's really
similar to this one only a little bit
warmer this Brown is a little bit more
cool toned and with this color I'm going
to get like right at my lashes I want
this one to be a little bit more precise
okay so that's pretty much all I want to
do on my eyes let me take off my tape
and then this is what you should be left
to it let me get a makeup wipes okay so
now I'm going to quickly start on my
face makeup I'm going to do my
foundation my primary my powder my
concealer and all of that before I
finish up the eyes the primer I'm going
to be using today is the NYX angel veil
primer I just got this one because I ran
out of my other one I love this primer
because it really does a good job of
just smoothing out your skin I don't
know how to explain it but foundation
just so well on top of this it kind of
goes into your fine lines and your pores
and just smooths it out because the
foundation I'm going to be using now
actually does settle into my line and
that foundation is the Neutrogena hydro
boost hydrating pin a part of me loves
this foundation and the part of me
doesn't really like it I'm just going to
apply this to my entire face it is light
coverage but you can build it up the
only thing I don't like is that it
settles into my lines I do find that it
dries fast so I'm just going to do my
face in sections and it also oxidizes
I've noticed that it does get a little
bit warmer as it's on your face or as
you're blending it out but then once it
oxidizes it's not too bad and it doesn't
oxidize to dark I like to have like a
cooling feeling when you're blending it
out on to your skin it almost feels cold
on the face I don't know like my face
feels cold right now I like it but
anyway it's not open to my lines which I
don't really like but I like that it's
very lightweight it looks like nothing
on the skin if you've never really worn
foundation before maybe this is a good
start because it is very light coverage
it's from the drugstore and you can
build it up if you want more coverage
and it still feels like skin I don't
know I think it's nice if you're just
starting out into makeup or if you like
a very fresh face kind of foundation I'm
just going to add a little bit more on
certain areas just to get a little bit
more coverage
see like I don't know if you can tell
but it's oxidized
can you tell Gore concealer I'm going to
go in with an oldie but a goodie this is
the Maybelline fit me concealer in the
shade fair I love this because it's very
hydrating it's perfect for dry skin and
it doesn't look cakey or too thick
underneath the eyes I really like the
coverage and I love how it blends out
and I really really love this concealer
I'm going to take my morphe g2 brush and
I'm going to blend that out I'm going to
get really really close to that wing
because I want it to look nice and sharp
and getting the concealer really close
to it is going to clean it up and not
let any of my skin peek through right
around there so because this concealer
is really really dewy it does crease on
me so I have to set it right away I'm
going to use my NYC smooth skin loose
face powder this is just a translucent
powder because very careful when you
open it because you said you don't mess
it off see go some of my bolts take my
g35 brush from morphe tanned I'm just
going to set that down
I'm also going to take from that
concealer and I'm going to put some on
my chin around my mouth on my nose and
between my eyebrows just so that
everything is nice and even and the rest
of my face is also highlighted I hate
seeing concealer on my mouth or
foundation I always feel like I look
like Billy Boozer sin' with foundation
on my mouth
fun fact now I'm going to set the rest
of my face makeup just because I feel
like well the foundation is very tacky
when you touch it so you want to make
sure you set it down because a lot of
the times if you don't set a wet or
tacky foundation when you go to apply
bronzer on top the bronzer will stick to
the product and it will look a little
bit muddy or splotchy so you want to
avoid that by studying your whole face
I'm going to use my ELF finishing powder
in the shade fair light I've only used
this a couple of times before today but
I really like the finish of this it
feels very very smooth almost creamy and
I really like it I'm going to use my ELF
brush I think this is an elf complexion
brush but it does have the name on it
I'm just going to use that to set my
face
I almost feel like this powder blurs my
skin and makes it look nice and smooth I
really really like it okay so before we
finish the face I'm going to go ahead
and finish up my eye makeup for my eyes
I'm even going to go simpler than usual
I'm not going to put any eyeshadow on my
lower lash line which is really weird
for me I never do that but I wanted to
switch it up today and I'm going to take
this color right here from the pixie
palette it's called snowflake and I'm
going to use this to highlight my inner
corner and in the pan it looks pretty
light but when I swatch it on my skin it
shows up kind of gold like pretty
intensely so I'm going to use this as my
inner corner highlight then I'm going to
go over it oh my gosh I'm so far then
I'm going to go over it with the shadow
we use under the brow bone this guy
doesn't roll too much but I did want a
little bit of gold in something in the
inner corner now I'm going to take that
Catrice contour palette I used earlier
and I'm going to go in with a highlight
shade and I'm gonna pop it on top and
now I'm going to pop on some eyeliners
this is the color pop from gel liner in
the shade honey dude it's just a nude
and I'm going to apply this to my
waterline this is really going to open
up the eyes and make it look bigger I'm
going to curl my lashes um these are
artificial more eyelash curlers wait two
more yes so it's not affordable and it's
definitely not drugstore but you can get
some really good eyelash curlers at this
drugstore you can go ahead and pop on
some falsies if you want to look extra
glamorous on valentine's day but for
simple looks I just love mascara by
itself I'm going to use the Kiko extra
sculpt volume mascara on my top and
bottom lashes
mm-hmm good mascara mileage I'll get
that like ah okay so the eyes are
officially done honestly takes like five
minutes to do this I look so now I'm
going to bronze my skin I would usually
like contour first and then add a little
bit of a bronze but I think I'm going to
bronze and then maybe add like a tiny
bit of a concept because I want this
look to be more fresh and youthful and
not so like sculpted I'm going to use
the new Milani baked bronzer in the
shade dolce it just recently came out I
just got it on the Milani website I'm so
excited I did use this once already and
it is a very warm light bronzer but I
really like it because compared to their
other baked bronzers it doesn't have
that much glitter in it I'm going to
take my Real Techniques blush brush and
I'm going to use this to bronze up the
skin it's one of those bronzers you do
have to build up but I love that about
it because when you come across a
bronzer that's a little bit too
pigmented it's like the first staff you
put on your face you're like whoa and
then you have to blend it out and all of
that so I love that this is buildable
and another thing I really love about
this is there are definite glitters
throughout this product but when you cut
your brush off it's almost like the
glitters fall off and they do not
translate to the face
I have a feeling this is a bronzer I'm
really really going to love in the
spring and summer I'm going to take some
on my neck because that foundation did
oxidize a bit I love this bronzer I love
that it's in warm but it's not too warm
it's warm enough to where you look nice
and bronzy and like summer eat a lot I
have to fix this I row really quick but
those of you wondering I never do my
brows on camera just because it's the
same process over and over again and I
feel like it gets so boring to watch and
I always do my brows first anyway so I
just do it off camera but this one here
got a little crazy I'm actually using
the LA girl shady slim brow pencil in
medium brown not as good as the
Anastasio one it's a little bit waxy err
but pretty comparable and it's so
affordable okay so I'm going to add just
a little bit of a contour right here at
the hollows of my cheeks I'm going to
use the crease contour palette I used
earlier and with this morphe y11 brush
just going to take a little bit of these
and apply some right here just to give a
little bit of a shadow there help slim
the face for Valentine's Day okay so I
was supposed to do this before I applied
all of my powder on my face but I am
going to take the Wet n Wild mega
cushion highlight this is my cream
highlight it's a really pretty pink it's
a very pink you can see it doesn't come
off as pink as it looks but I don't know
how this is going to look since I
already put powder down but I really
want to apply this as a base I'm going
to take my finger just put my finger and
my fingers are clean and I'm just going
to apply some it would probably look
better underneath powder instead of on
top but we'll go with it
I just want to give a little bit of a
glow because the highlight I'm putting
on is kind of like a highlight and
bronze and blush in one so I want to
make sure that the highlight underneath
stands out of it I'm going to take some
of this on the tip of my nose right
there and on the bridge of my nose as
well I'm also going to take some on my
Cupid's bell while I'm at it okay so for
blush I'm actually going to apply two
blushes because like I said earlier one
of them is more of a highlight so I'm
just going to add a little bit of this
color first this is the Pacifica natural
mineral blush in the shade camellia it's
a really beautiful like everyday peach
I'm going to take my Sonia Kashuk number
19 brush and apply some of this on my
cheeks okay so I just added a little bit
of that just to give myself some subtle
color before we go in with this guy
Milani came out with new baked blushes
they came out with two new shades I was
so excited about them but I do wish that
they would come out with at least
another one that wasn't as shimmery
because they're both pretty shimmery I
mean don't get me wrong
I love their blushes and most of them
are shimmery but they're both like
pretty intense this one is almost a
highlight pretty much Artemis is like
this is a highlight honestly if you are
deeper than me this will be a stunning
like base highlight but because I am
pretty fair I'm going to use this as a
blush and highlight in one I hope they
extend their range even more and they
come out with deeper shades more news
and like warm colors I'm going to take
the same brush and I was feeling was
going to be like too intense but let's
try and tap that off
not the kind of blush you want to apply
to your face if you have large pores I
will tell you that right now but for a
light dusting it's very pretty very very
intense yeah this is most definitely
more of a highlight I really like the
glow it gave my cheeks though very
beautiful very incense I'm going to take
this elf blush brush and I'm going to
focus some of this more on my cheekbones
and then I'm going to take my bronzer
brush and just blend everything okay so
that completes the face makeup all I
have to do now is apply my lip color
really quickly I want to give you my
little review on this I think it is
beautiful but because it is so shimmery
it will accentuate your pores a bit so
just keep that in mind maybe use a pore
filler right underneath this but I love
the glow it gave my face so I don't know
I love it but I don't love it if you're
even more fair than I am this will
definitely show up as a like pinky glowy
blush I see it I think it's really
pretty of them so before I go in with my
lip color I'm going to go ahead and
apply some setting spray this is the new
Milani make it dewy setting spray now I
don't really I'm not going to like this
nearly as much as I like there make it
last setting spray already is a bottle I
don't like as much the other one is like
a soft matte see-through bottle so you
can really see how much product you have
I don't like this bottle it's like white
and I don't like it I like the other one
way more but let's see how this works I
don't like the nozzle on this one huh
the other one sprays out more evenly I
don't like that I don't know I don't
know maybe it's just mine but I do not
like how this one sprays out at all I
don't know it's so weird it got like
everywhere and not all of it and got
like on my face I have to apply like
more than usual you're like it's making
me look oily like almost too dewy while
I was already looking dewy as it is this
will probably be really nice to apply on
top
Foundation when I have like everything
really Matt this will probably be
amazing kind of like the tatcha luminous
so we can mess I love using that as a
primer or adds like a finisher for Matt
stuff maybe I'll like this more from
that stuff but it doesn't make my face
feel greasy so fussing so make it do a
spray is like all over everything and it
created like a film okay so I'm going to
take this little target brush and my
Catrice mattifying powder in transparent
and I'm going to add a little bit of
this to the places where I feel like it
got a little bit too dewy there make it
last setting spray is phenomenal I would
highly recommend that one over this one
so it's going to help the look I'm going
in with my lip color I am going to take
the colour-pop ultra satin lip in the
shade Aquarius how many of you totally
saw this coming
I have this large pimple that has been
there for a long time but that's okay I
get rid of you eventually so because of
a romantic in like fresh Valentine's Day
look I do want to add a gloss on top of
this I'm going to take the Aquarius
gloss to apply on top how many of you
saw this one coming as well okay guys so
I hope you enjoyed this makeup look I
know it was so easy and almost kind of
stupid to do but this is the kind of
look I'm gonna wear on Valentine's Day I
just love fresh glowing skin and I
really like how it turned out but anyway
I hope you enjoyed this video thank you

will see you in my next video I go over
