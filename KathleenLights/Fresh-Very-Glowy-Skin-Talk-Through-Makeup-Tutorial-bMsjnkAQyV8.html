tutorial on this look right here it's
very simple it's mainly focused on my
skin there's something about spring and
summer that I just love looking extra
dewy and extra glowy as if the Sun and
the weather naturally made my skin look
that way but it was makeup it's very
minimal and fresh but it is still a full
face of makeup just on the
natural-looking side I love it I feel
like I can wear my makeup like this
every single day and I would be ok with
it just changing up my lip color and my
eyeliner and I'd be set so if you want
to see how to get this really dewy skin
and makeup I guess just keep watching so
the first thing I want to do is take my
hair on my face as peruse already filled
in my eyebrows and I use the colour-pop
brow pencil in taupe taupe the reason
I'm mentioning this is because I've
gotten a lot of questions from you guys
asking if I like it or not and I'm still
has a fence with these colour-pop brow
pencils I like them but I don't love
them like I like my anastacio one more
but this is so affordable so at the same
time it's like it's awesome but it's not
as waxy as I would like it to be but I
used it today and I've been using it I
like it it's just not my favorite to
prime my face
I'm going to use the glossy a priming
moisturizer I really really like this it
reminds me a lot of my Too Faced
hangover primer but it's even more
moisturizing if that's possible it
doesn't smell as good as that one but it
is very hydrating and it has that same
kind of consistency as well now usually
on a day to day basis I don't apply
foundation but this is like a full-blown
makeup tutorial like I'm doing the whole
shebang but today I'm going to be using
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
and I'm going to be mixing it with an
oil this is from the blissful body
it's an Etsy shop the blissful body
makes one of my favorite body
moisturizers but you can use any oil you
have argan oil jojoba oil any oil you
have this has like a bunch of different
oils in it I'm going to add a pump of
this to the back of my hand
I'm in the shade of porcelain and then
I'm just going to take a very little
amount of this and apply two little
drops to the back of my hand and mix
that in I'm going to take the elf
ultimate blending brush to buff that in
before I apply some concealer I'm going
to add some of this guy I just recently
purchased this and I have been loving
this this is the Marc Jacobs spotlight
glow stick pretty much looks like a
deodorant you know and honestly the
packaging kind of throws me off a little
bit I I don't know if it's marketed like
to just apply straight from the thing
but I don't like doing that
I'm gonna take these Sedona lace 217
brush and I'm going to apply this to the
tops of my cheekbones and I'm doing this
first because it is a cream product and
I want to lay down all the cream
products before I go over with powder
okay so now I'm going to apply some
under-eye concealer I'm going to use my
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
illumination this is like a newer
concealer I purchased mine either on the
it cosmetics website or Ulta pretty sure
I got this on the it website if you are
familiar with the bye-bye under-eye it's
pretty much the exact same thing only
it's a little bit more illuminating I'm
just going to apply very little like I
barely squeeze this onto my finger and
then blend it in because this is really
really really thick now I'm just
blending that in with this tiny little
random Kiko brush face 500 I remember
how I got this now I'm going to set the
under eyes and pretty much the rest of
my face with the RCM a no color powder
okay so an IR set my entire face and you
could see that my space is still glowy
but it's not tacky anymore because I
said it it so now I'm gonna bronze up
the skin I'm just gonna go ahead and
finish my face before I do my eyes
because I'm gonna do something extremely
simple on the eyes it's what I've been
doing a lot recently and I'm gonna use
the Physicians Formula but uh bronze you
guys know how I feel about this it's one
of the best bronzers I've ever tried
seriously I'm gonna use my zoeva luxe
grand powder brush number 90 I love this
for bronzer because if tapers and it's
perfect I love this brush some on the
neck and the jawline so it's a uniform
you know so that's pretty much all the
bronzer I want to add I'm not trying to
contour or anything but I do like to rub
some on my nose just so that it looks
like the Sun kind of kissed my whole
face for blush I'm going to go in with
the wet and wild color icon blush in
apricot in the middle apricot in the
middle actually just pick this one up at
Walgreens like two days ago I haven't
tried this one
hello this is hey multitask brush from
Real Techniques this is so beautiful
it's like 2 to 3 dollars gonna take my
morphe and b5 brush and just blend it
all together this is quite possibly my
favorite sibling brush of all time it's
really good
ok so I'm gonna go ahead and start on my
eyes because I want to show you guys a
little trick that I've been doing with
my highlight okay so for eyes we're
going very basic here very minimal I
have been extremely into metallic
eyeliner for like the past week rose
gold gold like I don't know I've just
really been into it one of my favorite
ones is from colour-pop it's called get
paid it's like a rose gold I also love
show me that one is like a bronze eagle
that one I've been using a lot too but
I'm just going to tightline with this
and add it to my waterline as well and
then I'll just take a pencil brush and a
color like really similar to the
eyeliner today I'm going to use the
L'Oreal color riche sunset eyeshadow and
on this a36 this is my favorite pencil
brush from morphe if you ever see me
using a pencil brush in my videos 9
times out of 10 it's going to be the e36
I have a 10% off morphe code I will link
it down below
best pencil brush ever this is the only
pencil brush that doesn't hurt my eyes I
know that seems really weird but a lot
of pencil brushes just scratch my eyes
I'm gonna add a little bit of this to my
lower lash line
and a little bit to my top lashes as
well this color is very very very soft
so it doesn't show up too much which I
like for looks like this because I only
want to define my lash line I don't
really want to do like an intense look
now I'm just curling my lashes and going
in with some mascara I'm using the Kiko
extra sculpt Volume Mascara coast of
Costa that completes the eyes as you can
see it's nothing special but it just
gives a little bit of a pop to the eyes
ah I'm such a fool the reason why I
wanted to do my eyes first and then come
back to the face is because I wanted to
show you my little trick but I put on
mascara already usually I don't like to
do this part with mascara but it's okay
we could do it today I'll show you in a
second but first I'm gonna take a little
bit of the hourglass powder in luminous
light this is a wet and wild stippling
brush and I'm just going out of place
some of this to my face to add a little
bit more of a glow because we're not
glowing enough for highlight I'm
actually going to take this product
right here this is the Laura Geller
filter finished setting powder in
universal it looks like it has a bunch
of color correcting powders but it's
pretty much like the same pearly kind of
finish and this is a very soft very
natural luminous powder like I don't
know if you could tell it's like barely
noticeable but I love it it doesn't
emphasize the texture on your skin it's
like a really nice soft everyday
highlight but the way I like to
intensify it just a little bit is I like
to set my face and then apply the
highlight with my face still being wet
so today I'm going to use the Wet n Wild
photo focus sighting spray this is
actually a great setting spray and it's
like under five dollars it does make
your makeup last all day so
and I love the spray nozzle on this it's
so fine and with my face still being a
little bit wet I'm going to take my fan
brush this is the morphe m3 1-0 and
gonna highlight my cheeks this is an
awesome little trick to do for those of
you who feel like your highlight isn't
intense enough this is awesome for you
and also I feel like it makes my
highlight last longer I don't know what
it is I don't know if it's because I'm
applying it on top of a setting spray it
just makes my highlight last all day
when I do it like this awesome so now
I'm just gonna let that dry okay so now
that my face is pretty much dry this is
what my skin looks like my face is
completely dry it's not tacky because I
initially set it with a powder and then
I just continue to use powder products
on top like if you saw my skin in person
you would never tell I have super dry
skin power of makeup and then to finish
off this look I'm going in with a lip
products this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lipstick in Dolce
I feel like this color is perfect for
spring because it's like a nude but it's
like a coral II nude I really like it
another lip product I cannot get enough
of is Laguna Beach by Ofra it's the best
so yeah that completes this makeup
tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed it
