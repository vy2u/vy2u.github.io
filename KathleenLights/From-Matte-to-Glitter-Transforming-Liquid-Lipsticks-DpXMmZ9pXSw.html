kind of first impressions but lip swatch
video and just a review overall on the
new ciate glitter flip transforming
glitter liquid lipstick I was actually
gonna film with completely different
video today but a quick little story
around 1 a.m. on Sunday
technically Monday I woke up with the
worst stomach ache ever and I threw up
and I did other things besides throw up
if you catch my drift and it didn't stop
all night so I went to the urgent care
and I had food poisoning I something the
day before and it just destroyed my
stomach so I was feeling like poop all
day yesterday and today when I woke up I
still felt a little bit mom but I
started feeling a little better and I
was like you know what I'm gonna sit
down I'm gonna film that glitter flip
video because I'm just so intrigued by
this you probably have already seen a
few videos on this so I'm sorry if this
video is like oh my god another glitter
flip video but these look so cool and
from what I've seen online they do seem
to work but I want to try it out for
myself so let me explain you don't like
a matte liquid lipstick but they're like
a metallic matte liquid lipstick and
then supposedly you wait two minutes for
them to completely dry and then you
press your lips together and then that
activates all the glitter and the more
you press your lips together the more
glitter shows so if you just wanted to
wear this as a metallic matte liquid
lipstick you wouldn't press your lips
together and then it wouldn't get
glittery but this would be so cool for
like festivals or fun parties to just
have fun and glittery lips or like
holiday parties I don't know
this could be really exciting it says
you can get a multi-dimensional glitter
lip with none of the mess and in under
half the time of a traditional glitter
lip look it's supposed to be long
wearing and comfortable I'm not sure how
well I will test the long way apart
since it is almost so I'm gonna clock at
6:50 p.m. I would like I said I wasn't
gonna film today but I won't wash my
face or go to bed till around 11:00 so I
have to go eat something and then edit
this video so I'll be up for a while so
I will leave in the description box how
it wore for like four hours
it also says it's
drawing so like I said you're just
supposed to apply this wait for it to
dry for two full minutes and then press
your lips together and watch your
transform before your eyes so let me
take off my lip gloss I'm wearing the I
love satire and colour-pop ultra glossy
lip in Kirby I love it and okay let's
zoom you in okay so I'm gonna do lip
swatches of all seven shades I did
purchase all seven of these myself when
I saw everyone's video on it I got so
excited I went on Sephora and I bought
all of them and we're gonna watch all of
them transform because I actually
haven't seen a couple of these swatch
like I don't know what the red one looks
like I'm like genuinely so excited for
these I don't know why I'm a
five-year-old but this is what the
packaging looks like really really
pretty and yeah has like stars and
glittery stuff so this is the color
candy and it's the lightest shade so
let's try this on oh my god I don't
wanna force my lips together okay so I
know they're supposed to be metallic but
this one is not too metallic I thought
it was gonna be a little more intense
but I actually like this I feel like it
makes this one just a little bit more
wearable so I'm gonna let that dry for
two full minutes I'm not gonna press my
lips together and then I'll come back
and we will see it transform okay so
it's been two full minutes I want to
show you guys what it looks like before
I press my lips together because you can
kind of see the little glitters peeking
through and I just want to show you how
it looks on the lips so I don't know if
you can tell but it does look just a
little bit drying all right so let's see
hmm oh my gosh this is pretty freaking
epic this is incredible
you know I keep pressing my lips
together and it's not disrupting the
liquid lipstick at all my major worry
with this product is that you would
press your lips together so many times
and it would eventually take off your
liquid lipstick like you would just peel
it off like I know it just peel off but
it's not doing that it looks so cool and
let me tell you it looks cooler in
person than it does on my viewfinder I
mean I'm probably the only youtuber in
the world that still films Jessie's a
viewfinder and not a monitor I'm so bad
with technology but it looks so cool in
person alright so that way
candy and I'm like so excited these are
so great and cool and now let's try on
all the other sheets okay so next up we
have infamous
that's kind of right yeah this one is so
beautiful I really really like this one
the longer it dries the more the little
glitter particles start to appear but
this one doesn't look so metallic either
this one looks pretty wearable I feel
like you can totally wear this one out
and not have people looki like girl you
metallic lipstick on I really really
like this one a lot so I'm gonna wait
those two full minutes and well you know
I'm not gonna say this every time for
every liquid lipstick by the way excuse
the swatches in this video these lip
swatches are gonna be pretty sloppy I
just feel it especially on the darker we
go I just feel it
oh I love this one oh my gosh it did not
expect that coat I thought I was gonna
be like pinky shimmers and this is
almost like a purple silvery amethyst
definitely not something I would wear
out on a daily basis but for certain
occasions this could be so cool way to
go see a tape I would have never come up
with something like this so that was
infamous this next one is called
forbidden and it's a dark red ooh
that's actually a lot barrier than I
thought it was gonna be these little
swatches are awful I'm sorry this one's
actually a little hard to apply okay so
this one didn't apply the best you'll
see when i zoom in the application no
bueno
I suck but besides that it did apply
just a little bit patchy I had to go
over certain sections a few times so try
to make it even aside from that I do
really like this color this one does
look a little bit more metallic than the
other two but again not on metallic
that's extremely unwearable this is
definitely a color I would wear but I
would personally wear a darker lip liner
underneath or just something to really
even things out cuz the application was
just a little patchy by the way as I was
waiting for this to dry I noticed I
didn't do a kiss test for you they don't
transfer woo this is what this one looks
like I would have liked a different kind
of shift I would have liked a different
glitter but that's just me being really
weird yeah this one is really nice but
it's not my favorite next up we have
siren I'm so excited for this one this
one is like a beautiful mermaid color
this would be so cool to wear like on
your lips for Halloween if you're gonna
be a mermaid oh let's see
this one is so cool aside from the fact
that I applied this like an amateur it
is so fun this one is definitely
metallic but I love how it looks just
like this it's so cool and unique but
wow really I'm really liking this one it
does get on my teeth a little bit but
it's so fun this would look amazing with
like some intense winged eyeliner like
at this like of the siren or like at
this area so so so so so so cool I did
notice that it had taken off a little
bit of a liquid lipstick when I first
put my lips together but it's nothing
that's too noticeable was right here
nothing too crazy but I think this one
is so cool and such a unique lip color
it's probably my favorite so far okay so
next up is the color I was most excited
for when I went to purchase these this
one's called Hollywood and it's the
beautiful holiday Christmas red so this
one has pinky little glitters in it you
can see it has kind of like a pinky
little metallic shift I think it's so
pretty though it looks so cool for a
holiday party I really like this one
let's see how glittery ooh I love it
this one does transfer a bit though you
can kind of see I like transferred a
little bit on to the top you know like
this one does transfer just slightly but
nothing too crazy and looks so cool with
the flash on
so besides this one transferring I
really really really like this one
next up is fortune and this one is a
dark dark purple and it looks like it
has little blue and purple glitters this
one is so funny reminds me of Halloween
it's like witchy like I love it it
reminds me of a Nastasia potion does
potion look like this I think a little
bit I love it you can see it's a little
bit metallic but it's not like frosty
that's what I really like about these
they're metallic but not like whoa
months Alec you know I really like him
the only thing I don't like I've noticed
this with every single color is little
specks will just stay on my teeth and
that is starting to really piss me off
maybe I'm just applying it like too
close inside or I don't know see like
oh my good I love it this one is so
intent oh my gosh
I love this one and it wasn't patchy
going on the way forbidden was patchy
this one went on really smooth this one
actually might be my new favorite like
look at that sparkle and really no
transfer alright this one is called
iconic and this one looks familiar to
fortune but it's a bit deeper it kind of
looks like a blue instead of a purple
this one has like blue sparkles in it
and I think it has like a navy blue base
alright this one is cool yeah it looks
absolutely nothing like this one but it
is so cool I love navy blue it's one of
my favorite colors and this just looks
so intense and cool and it does have a
little bit of a metallic shift but you
don't really see the glitters too much
when it's on its own I think it looks
pretty good I don't know I really like
this one too it's so vampy or like this
one I like it I'm 12
ooh this one is super intense even more
intense than the other one oh my gosh
the last two are definitely my favorites
they're just so unique this one looks so
gorgeous so intense Wow so much glitter
so much blue glitter a moment okay guys
so that completes this video these are
my thoughts on the new glitter flip
metallic liquid lipsticks by ciate there
was only a couple of cons I would say
the major one is that some of these
little things get into my teeth but they
don't really feel drying they do look a
little drawing on my lips but I have
very dry lips right now but they do feel
really comfortable I'm gonna continue to
wear this one for the rest of the night
and then I will leave a little update in
the info box but so far so good
obviously these are not extremely
wearable for everyday but I think
they're innovative and they're really
unique and fun hey guys leave me a
comment down below letting me know if
you have picked these up recently from
Sephora what do you think of these I
would love to know but that completes
this video guys thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye
tell her bill I like matte lips you look
so stupid this would look amazing with
like some intense swing this would look
amazing with like some intense way my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
