a simple tutorial not really tutorial
tomorrow get ready with me I'm going to
be doing kind of like a fresh makeup
look
nothing I've never done before it's not
everyday because I am using a lot of
products but it is fresh face and
perfect for summer and I am using all
drugstore products and yeah I figured I
would do a video like this it's pretty
simple because I feel like dog poop you
know how when you get a cold like your
entire body kind of feels weak and even
like talking too much kind of takes your
breath away like you have to step back
and be like whoa I got breathing that's
how I'm feeling right now but I wanted
to do a drugstore video I wanted to do
kind of like a fresh simple summer
makeup with a bright bold lip to match
my nails so this is definitely a magic
city inspired makeup tutorial using
affordable products and it's very very
easy so I'm just going to go ahead and
get started I'm going to be using the
elf prep and hydrate balm I really like
this it kind of gives my face at cooling
feeling and I have been trying a lot of
these like balm sticks as primers and
not all of them are good some of them
sometimes I don't really like and then I
kind of just cut that end for foundation
I'm actually going to be mixing two
things I'm going to take my number seven
list and luminate foundation and then
I'm going to be mixing it a little bit
with the Pacifica multi mineral BB cream
this is an all-in-one skin tint and you
can also use it as an illuminating
primer it doesn't have much coverage but
I'm going to be mixing them so that I
can get a more fresh look to the skin
I'm just going to mix these two on the
back of my hand and I'm just going to
blend that in the BB cream kind of
sheers out the foundation a little bit
it looks a little bit less like our
nation
also this BB cream does have a little
bit of shimmer in it which I kind of
like because it's not like too
aggressive you know and of course I'm
using my flower beauty sponge that I am
obviously it's a group it is about to
pour so hard the sky is black like black
I hope that doesn't affect my lighting
okay so now I'm going to go in with
concealer and I'm also mixing two
concealers I don't know my dealers today
I'm going to be taking the Wet n Wild
photo focus concealer in ivory light
ivory and then I'm going to be taking
the Milani retouch and erase light
lifting concealer in light I'm mixing
both of them because I really like the
consistency of this one and I like how
it looks really fresh under the eyes but
I like the creaminess and the finish of
this I also like the coverage this one
has so I'm going to mix them both I'm
gonna put them on the back of my hand
and then I'll just go in with a brush
I'm going to take my ELF
lip &amp;amp; cheek brush I'm going to mix it
with the lip side
originally when I wanted to sit down to
film this video I really wanted to use
the ofra liquid lipstick in ultimate red
it's like my favorite red lipstick they
have it honestly inspired Magic City the
nail polish I'm wearing because it's
like a neon red but it's not an orange
neon red I don't know how to explain it
it's so beautiful but I cannot find my
ultimate red anywhere I lose everything
and I can't find it anywhere so I just
decided to do a drug sort like a
full-face drugstore look instead but
ultimate red is literally the exact the
exact same color as my nail polish way
more exact than this one this is the one
I'm going to be using in this video but
if you have ultimate red at home and you
have magic city they go hand in hand
it's the lipstick I was wearing in my
photo shoots when I was in the pool with
Magic City I loved it but I couldn't
find it I think I left it in a purse
somewhere because I wore it the other
day but I looked and I wasn't in there
so I mean I don't know okay so before I
go in with powder I do want to use a few
cream products I love doing this in the
summer I just think it looks so natural
and just less powdery and I hate looking
powdery especially in the summertime I
just want to look fresh all day so I'm
using the wet and wild cushion contour
and I'm going to use this to bronze the
skin if it / - like contour of it I'm
gonna be using this elf brush I'm not
exactly sure what the name is but it's
in this like clear clutches
I really love this brush because it has
little tiny hairs that stick out you
really can't see it but I love that
about this brush because it really helps
you blend things out easier I love it if
you haven't tried this brush definitely
try it out it's awesome for cream
contouring or for underneath the eyes I
love it I'm just going to add a little
bit of this because I will go over with
a bronzer in a second okay so now I'm
going to apply cream highlight before I
go and powder everything I just want to
be very giving me today what can I say
I'm going to be using my fingers to
apply this this is the Jordana glowing
gold creamy strobing stick and I'm going
to use a shade radiant glow and I'm just
going to apply a little bit of this onto
the cheekbones because the highlight
that we will be going in with is very
highlighting so I just want to add kind
of like a base usually I'll set my under
eye consider before I apply cream
highlights because most of the time the
powder will cover the cream highlight
but I forgot to do that I didn't do that
today I don't know why I guess I was
just on a roll with creamy stuff I'm
going to go over my eyes and my under
eyes just to make sure that there are no
creases and I'm going to be using my
Real Techniques setting brush
and my wet and wild photo focus pressed
powder I'm going to set my under eyes
I'm also going to take some of that
right in my t-zone here and a little bit
on my chin and I'm going to leave the
rest the way that it is it is a little
bit tacky but once we put on bronzer
blush highlight it'll set everything
down for bronzer I'm going to take my
Physicians Formula bit of bronzer I love
this you already know amazing I'm going
to be taking my ELF pointed powder brush
I'm gonna be using this to bronze up the
skin by the way my friend Stephanie and
I like we're obsessed with Lion King and
we were looking how they're creating a
live-action Lion King which is amazing
and I am so excited that James Earl
Jones is going to play the voice of
Mufasa again how amazing is that how
amazing is that
but but what why don't they get the
voices of these like original cartoons I
mean I don't get it like the voice of
Timon that guy's still alive right why
doesn't he want to do to mom like I
can't picture to mold with any other
voice and I don't know how I'm not
disappointed with that live-action
because that is my favorite Disney movie
of all time like does it get better than
the Lion King out of this
I don't feel too hot probably going to
take off this makeup as we lay down I
can't I can't I have so much to do again
by the way whenever I do my makeup like
this where I don't set my entire face on
my face is still tacky and sticky you
can apply a bronzer and like a patting
motion and you'll get less of like a
patchy look all right for blush I'm
going to take this Milani warm petals
powder blush this is one of my favorite
blushes ever you have a slight sheen to
it but it doesn't come off like super
glittery on the skin I really like it
when I take my Real Techniques blush
brush I'm just going to apply some of
this on to the cheek this has quickly
become like one of my favorite blushes
of all time actually I'm not sure if it
was limited edition I hope it wasn't
and now for Haile I'm gonna be using a
highlight having unist in what feels
like years probably expired but it's the
powder product right beats these last a
long time this is the Physicians Formula
natural nude little palette it's so old
I like I even ripped off the back just
so I can see in a mirror and not have to
open it lazy problem I'm going to focus
in on this golden color right here at
the bottom and then I'm going to mix it
with this color up at the top this has
to be one of the most blinding
highlights at the drugstore and I feel
like nobody really talks about I mean I
haven't even talked about it in a long
time we get so caught up in what's new
like in the beauty community that we
like don't even use the stuff that's in
our collection it's seriously one of the
best highlights of the drugstore I mean
look at that and it doesn't look chunky
or fake it's very much a sheen I really
really like this and now so everything
melts right into the skin and becomes
one with my face I'm going to be taking
the Catrice Prime and buying
multi-talent fixing spray just going to
let that sink right in this shoots so
aggressively it is a fine mist but if it
owes a lot of it all at once so even
though it's a fine mist you're like
super wetting your face anyway for the
eyes I'm keeping it very simple in the
summertime whenever I do like dewy skin
like this I don't really like to apply
eyeshadow but for today's video I am
going to apply just a little bit of
something and this is really how I save
a lot of time whenever I do want to
apply something on the eyes but I want
to do my makeup extremely fast I'll just
take my bronzer the same bronzer are
used and a big fluffy brush this is the
only brush in the video that is in
drugstore I always use brushes like this
when I do this type of thing where it's
really really quick so please leave me
your suggestions down below do you guys
know of a drugstore brush that looks
like this a crease brush that's really
really fat and fluffy this is the Sigma
e-40 I have crease pressures from the
drugstore but none that are this poufy
so let me know if you know of any
because I need it in my life
so I just take a little bit of this and
honestly this is all I do let's just run
it through the crease and on the lid
because sometimes I do just want to
contour the crease of my eye but I don't
want to sit there and like do a whole
eye shadow look boom oh man I forgot and
then with this elf little pointed pencil
brush we can run that on my lower
lashline kind of sloppily being too
precise or too careful just to add a
little bit of shadow and then sometimes
what I like to do I don't do this all
the time but sometimes I'll just take my
highlight or like a very shimmery
eyeshadow and a big brush like this this
is the wet and wild unicorn brush I
don't know the name of this I'll go into
my highlight I'm going to go right here
on the more golden side really tap this
off and I will just brush this on top of
my ball my balls
what my eyeballs sorry I don't know just
to give kind of like a golden sheen to
the eyes it just gives a slight golden
glow and in person it kind of looks like
you added a shimmery bronze eyeshadow
though I'm going to take this white
golden color right here this is going to
be my inner corner highlight this brush
is an LA Colors eyeshadow brush it's
like literally a dollar at the dollar
store and boom we are done with the eyes
but yet they look like they have a
little bit of something you know from us
here I'm going to be using this bad boy
I mean I cannot get enough of this it's
such a good mascara this is the l'oreal
voluminous lash
but i'm actually going to be using black
brown and honestly is like barely looks
brown
okay so everything is pretty much done
eyes are done vases done just fresh do
we look it's ready for the bed but we
are going to go in with a hot pop of
color on the lip this is the perfect way
to tie everything together because
everything although with a lot of
products are still very fresh and
minimal to an extent you know you don't
have like a crazy smoky eye going on but
the perfect way to just tie everything
together is a nice bold lip because your
look just looks completed so I'm going
to take the Jordana sweet cream matte
liquid lip color in the shade mango
sorbet and it's not exactly the same
like I said earlier ultimate red is
exactly the same but this is as close as
I got when it came to all my drugstore
at lip products okay so this definitely
isn't my favorite lip formula it's a bit
patchy and cracki so I would definitely
use a lip balm underneath this I made a
mistake and I didn't do that yeah I
would even recommend using a lip liner
on top of the lip balm and then putting
this on I know it seems like a lot of
steps but this is a very affordable lip
product and you kind of need to work
with it a bit so just letting you know
just in case you get this although the
color is beautiful the formula is not
the best when I was looking through all
my drugstore lipsticks a lot of them
have that strong orange undertone which
you know is like my favorite lip color
this one is more of a poppy red which I
love on the nails I also love on the
lips but I kind of struggled to find
something to match these nails but I'm
glad I did and I really love how this
look turned out I do look like this all
the time they're my favorite in the
summertime it's just so fresh and
perfect for vacations anyway I hope you
enjoyed this simple talk-through
laid-back
tutorial leave me a comment down below
