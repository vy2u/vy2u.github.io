this makeup look right here this is a
full drugstore look and I'm also using
affordable brushes as well I really like
this look it's an intense eyeliner but
everything else is really soft like the
soft pink in the crease and the face is
really soft as well but the eyeliner is
very intense it kind of comes in on the
inner corners a little bit cat eye ish
this is a little bit different for me
because I rarely ever wear eyeliner but
after I did this look I'm like eyeliner
crazy I love it so I really really hope
you guys enjoy this look and let me know
in the comments what you think so if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep on watching so I'm gonna prime
my eyelids as usual I like primers like
this that also work as a base because
they cover up all those ugly little
veins on my eyelids and that was the la
girl pro primer I'm gonna dip my finger
into this white eyeshadow in the Sonia
Kashuk eye on neutral palette I'm using
my finger because the only eyeshadow I
don't love in this palette is the white
one it's a little bit chalky so I like
to use my finger then I'm gonna take
this fluffy blending brush from Delhi M
tools I will link all the brushes down
below as well so I'm taking this fluffy
crease brush from bdellium tools and I'm
applying that pink color directly in the
crease and I am putting this sucker
everywhere I want it to very pink in my
crease then I'm gonna take this elf
brush and I'm gonna dip it into this
cool toned Brown it's a light cool tone
tannish taupey color and I'm gonna start
applying this on the outer V of my eye
and bringing it into my crease so I'm
just packing it on the outer V and
dragging it into the crease this eye
shadow brush is really easy to do that
since it's fluffy but flat at the same
time
went back into the Sonia Kashuk palette
I'm going to take this super topi
purplish kind of color and on that same
brush I'm gonna just do the exact same
things so on the outer V and then
bringing it into my crease I'm using
these two shades to kind of you know
create some dimension and so it you know
has different colors if that makes sense
either I'm gonna take this little trail
from Wet n Wild to see walking on
eggshells trio and I'm mixing those two
shades I was pointing out and I'm gonna
apply this on the inner half of my lid
using this elf brush this is the
one-dollar brush and then I'm gonna dip
my fluffy brush again into the deep pink
and I'm just gonna blend everything out
sorry I feel like I'm moving too that
I'm gonna dip that same elf brush into
the white really packing it into the
white and applying this to my brow bone
as a highlight I'm gonna take this
darker Brown in the palette it's also a
very cool tone but I'm applying this
bright at the outer V of my eye to
create a darkness on the outer corners
this is just a darker Brown than the
other ones we were using and then I'm
gonna use my NYC liquid liner and I'm
gonna apply a very thick wing so what I
like to do is I like to draw the line
first and then do this and then fill it
in so I do that kind of wing first and
then I start brushing the little strokes
on the inner corners just to connect
everything and then yeah I got out of
frame but all I did was fill in that
part that make sense I really suck at
eyeliner but I just did my typical wing
I go back and I fix it but I just did
like a basic think wing do whatever you
guys want you don't have to do that so I
primed my face with a luminous primer
and then I'm gonna mix these two
foundations this is the Maybelline fit
me and the Maybelline fit me matte and
poreless I like to mix these two because
I have dry skin so sometimes the fit me
the original is a little bit too dewy
which I do love but
singing it with the new matte and
poreless creates a beautiful like
natural satin finish I love this
combination and I'm using a small
stipple brush stiffle know a small
stipple brush from ELF because you have
to work in sections with the matte and
poreless because it dries really really
fast and then I realized I had no
earrings on sale so I'm just working in
sections and I love this brush it gets
in the nooks and crannies of everything
I don't know I really like it so that's
what I'm doing then I'm gonna add some
concealer to my under eyes this is the
LA girl Pro conceal in natural and then
I'm gonna highlight some more so I'm
using the Rimmel conceal and highlight
little highlighter concealer things and
I'm gonna apply this all over my face to
highlight my face as well
I'm gonna use this brush from ELF this
is their tapered highlighter brush and
I'm gonna use that to blend it all in I
really love elf brushes the studio line
is really affordable and really soft
like very soft I love them so I'm just
blending that all in then I'm going to
take my Maybelline fit me powder in 1/35
creamy natural and I'm gonna set my
concealer on my face but to set my under
eye concealer I'm using this elf under
eye setting powder I like it because
it's like light reflecting and reminds
me a lot of the laura mercier secret
brightening powder but it's three
dollars and not like a million then
after that I'm gonna finish off my eyes
and I'm gonna take that same liquid
liner and now I'm gonna start a
connecting this into the inner part of
my eye does that make sense I'm making
like a little triangle right in the
inner tear-duct and usually I don't add
eyeliner there but I think it creates
like a sexy cat eye look as you can see
right there so that is what I did and I
feel like it ties the eyeliner together
really nicely so then after that I'm
gonna take some black eyeliner I have
been loving this this is from NYX it's
they're like gel eyeliner in black it's
new it's like their new eyeliner it's
amazing guys it's a super black lip with
lip so black I really love it I'm gonna
take this Ecotools angled brush and I'm
gonna dip it into the black eyeshadow
and I'm gonna set the eyeliner like
bringing it really really really really
close to my waterline and yeah it's just
gonna intensify the eyeliner on the
lower lash line so after that I applied
mascara to my top and bottom lashes and
then I would
with some red carry for fifteen lashes
just finish off the eye look I'm gonna
dip this morphe crease brush into that
brown shade and I'm just gonna deep it
up the outer corner like that like I'm
just gonna apply it really softly right
in the outer V kind of in the crease and
I feel like it's just gonna add a little
bit more dimension and finish off the
eyes so then I'm gonna go ahead and do
the rest of my makeup just my face
makeup I'm gonna take this NYX high
definition blush in the shade taupe and
I'm gonna use this to contour this is a
elf
what is this a powder brush from elf
like uh I think it's like a powder
foundation brush and I love it for
contouring because it's not too small
but it's not too big this is a very ashy
blush like a Toby color very a she's so
perfect for contouring but just to warm
up the skin a little bit not too much
I'm gonna tip that same brush into my
NYC Sun and bronze bronzer in Montauk
bronze so just gonna warm it up a little
bit because that taupe blush is like
great like hella grey like super super
ashy so you do have to be a little bit
careful
after that I'm gonna take this beautiful
like tulip style brush from bdellium
tools and I'm gonna use this to apply my
blush this is the NYX high definition
blush in soft-spoken I believe I will
leave all the information in the
description box it's a really pretty
light peachy color love this blush then
of course to highlight my Physicians
Formula shimmer strip in naturally nude
and I'm applying that with an elf blush
brush to the tops of my cheekbones and
on the bridge of my nose and I'm just
gonna do my lips this is the Rimmel
exaggerate lip liner in natural I
believe it's what it's called
and the reason I'm applying this lip
liner is because the lipstick I'm gonna
put on top looks awful without a lip
liner underneath because it settles into
my lines really badly none of the rest
of those lipsticks and that line do but
that one kind of settles but I love the
color so I have to put a lip liner
underneath and I'm using the Milani
moisture matte lipstick and matte
innocence
