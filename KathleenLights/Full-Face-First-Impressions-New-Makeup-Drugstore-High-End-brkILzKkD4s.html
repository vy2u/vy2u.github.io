a purse because I've never used this
eyeshadow palette before and I've
already primed my lids and we're going
to be going into the flower Beauty
shimmer and shade eyeshadow palette this
is a brand by Drew Barrymore and she
came out with a few different palettes
she has a more neutral one a more bronze
one I also purchased the bronze one I
actually wanted to use the bronze one
today that's the main one I was excited
for I bought both of these on the
Walmart website but when I got the
bronze one in the mail it was completely
shattered so today I'm gives using this
one this is the warm natural palette I'm
really nervous to see how these perform
they swatch really nicely though these
products are sixteen dollars and when I
first saw that price I was like whoa
that's a lot of money for it I shot a
pilot at the drugstore
but it comes with this little brush
right here which is actually a really
good quality brush it's like a little
crease brush and it says 'bonus six
dollar brush so I'm assuming that's why
sixteen dollars you get the palette for
ten bucks and then this brush for six
I'm going to start it I'm going to first
apply this color right here to my crease
I'm using a Sephora Pro crease brush
these are super powdery when you put
your brush in there's a lot of kick up
so hopefully there's not a lot of
fallout
so this seems to be blending really
nicely it is powdery there's a lot of
kick up but it doesn't affect the way
it's blending it's actually blending
really nicely into my crease it's a
really really soft eye shadow next I'm
going to actually take these two shades
and mix them together this is like a
really light mauve and this is a more
dark purple
oh so my brushes are on Shh these two so
I'm going to take this color right here
and I'm going to put this on my entire
lid and to apply that I'm just using my
Sigma e55 brush so this eye shadow isn't
as pigmented as I thought it was going
to be I thought it was going to be much
darker than this I mean it it's packing
on pigment but not as much as I thought
I would I'm really sad my bronze one
came broken because I feel like that one
would have been perfect I heard so many
great reviews about the bronze one I'm
just going to purchase it again I'm
going to go back into the first crease
shade we used it's really pretty brown
right here and I'm going to blend out
those harsh edges so I want to intensify
as the eyelid color a little bit more so
I'm going to take some setting spray
this is my make it last setting spray by
Milani my favorite and I'm going to take
that same brush I used with that all
over the shade I'm going to dip it into
that color again and then I'm going to
spray my brush with some setting spray
just kind of applying a little bit
patchy and I know it's not the setting
spray because I usually use fix+ to do
this but I've been using my Milani
setting spray over fix+ and it's been
working with other eyeshadows but I feel
like this shadow specifically I don't
know it's a little off but that's okay
we will make it work
doesn't help a little bit though it
doesn't look darker going back into that
first crease shade we use again that
light brown I'm just going to blend some
up so the major thing missing from this
palette is a brow bone shade there is
nothing for me to highlight my brow bone
so I'm going to take this palette right
here this is the elf shadow brow and
liner palette this is pretty new and it
just comes with a bunch of different
Browns you can use this for your brows
for your eyes for whatever you want and
I'm going to take this light shade right
here and I'm going to use that to
highlight my brow bone I never use this
palette before either by the way you
clean up underneath my brow bone and I'm
using my luck C to 1/3 brush the next
product I want to try out is this bad
boy right here this is the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid shadows I've heard so many people
raving about this I'm having for a while
but I haven't tried them on my eyes yet
I've just swatch them I'm going to take
the shade rose gold retro and I pop this
on my lid I don't know if I should just
start blending it with my fingers or
yeah okay I feel like they dry pretty
quickly which isn't a bad thing you just
have to work with them really fast
I'm going to go back into the flower
palette and use that shade I used on my
entire lid and with that little brush
that came with this palette I'm going to
start packing this on the outer corners
and blending out those harsh edges a
little bit what I do notice what these
glitters is once they completely dry if
you try blending on top of them all you
do is just take off the glitter so as
I'm blending this color into my crease
the glitters are just falling off in my
crease so make sure you apply this
glitter after you've already applied all
of your eye shadow so that none of it
just falls off I'm going to take this
charcoal color right next to it and I'm
only going to apply a little bit of this
on the outer corners just to deepen up
the look I'm just going to pack it on so
I don't disturb any of the glitter what
is that on my computer this thing he
thought oh man I do it anyway
now I'm going to go back into that first
brown shadow we use and I'm going to do
the same thing I'm just going to blend
out my crease I'm using it as the wave
oh 2 to 7 brush to do this I'm going to
go back into that color I was using
before this and I'm just deepening up
some more one thing I do notice about
this eyeshadow palette it's really easy
to correct your mistakes like if you
apply too much eyeshadow it's really
easy to blend it away because they're so
soft and they're so easy to blend I'm
going to take some of my simple white
and I'm just going to clean up all the
fallout
this is definitely an eyeshadow palette
you want to use before you do your eye
make your face makeup same goes with
those glitters you definitely want to
apply the glitter before you do your
face makeup okay you know the drill I'm
going to start on my face makeup before
I finish up my eyes let me put on my
head I am so the primer I'm going to be
testing out today for the first time is
the Korres Greek yogurt smoothie priming
moisturizer I'm a little bit worried to
use this if I'm honest because it has a
oh I have a very strong baby powder
scent and I don't know if that's going
to break me out I hope it doesn't feel
very nice on the skin like a really
light moisturizer I wanted to try out
something hydrating because the
foundation I'm going in with I feel like
it's going to give me a pretty matte
finish so summation I'm going to be
using today I'm very excited to use it I
paid a lot of money for it but when it
came out I had a ton of questions so
many of you guys are asking me to review
it this is the Giorgio Armani power
fabric long wear high cover foundation
SPF 25 and with something so many of you
guys wanted to see how I felt about this
one because I wasn't a huge fan of the
luminous silk which is weird because I
have very dry skin it breaks down way
too quickly after about three hours I
feel like I'm overly doing it and I just
look a little bit greasy which sucks
because when I initially put it on I'm
obsessed with how it looks like I like
wearing it for talking videos and I'm
not going to go out during the day
because it just looks so
Oh undoing but I don't like how it wears
so I'm kind of excited to try this out I
got the shade of 4.5 it does look like
it's going to be a little bit too dark
for me but we'll figure it out I bought
mine I don't know how I feel about this
primer it kind of just sank into my skin
I don't really feel any like hydration
anymore so I was really excited to test
out this new Real Techniques sponge that
I bought an old tub I don't know why
they made it like two-tone like this I
feel like the top is the miracle
complexion sponge which I love from Real
Techniques and then the bottom is just
like a pink one but oh my gosh I'm kind
of shocked this is completely wet and
it's the exact same size it was when it
was dry so it didn't expand at all and
it didn't get any softer this sponge is
literally like a freaking rock like
which is kind of shocking considering
their miracle complexion sponge is so
good why does this not expand at all
it's like so stiff oh I don't even want
to use that is so hard no instead I'm
going to be using the Loreal sponge that
they just recently came out with I have
used this like three or four times and I
love it and I have to say I'm kind of
shocked that I love it now say to lore'l
but I didn't think they were going to
master a nice squishy soft sponge but
they really really did this is already
wet and I've already run out though oh I
guess now I'm going to use this
foundation with a sponge because I have
a feeling with my dry skin I should use
a sponge mm-hmm
Oh seems like a pretty good match in the
bottle it definitely looks darker right
I don't know
this glittery stuff definitely gives you
some fallout definitely you can kind of
tell it's darker than my next test okay
nothing a little problems that won't fix
and I'm sure it'll match me better when
we go into the spring and summer months
you know if this is a really long
wearing foundation this might be a
really great mixer to use with my
luminous silk foundation and then maybe
I can actually get like a lot of use out
of that luminous silk because I have it
and maybe mixing those these two would
be a really nice combination looking at
my skin ignoring the color I think I
really like this slightly matte
right here on my nose it's my problem
areas foundations love to sink into
there just a little bit cakey but not
even that much honestly
the coverage is really good I would say
it's a medium to full you could still
see my disgusting vein right here that I
love so much so I would definitely think
it's like a medium coverage but you have
build it too full for sure it's not
really tacky when I put my fingers to it
just slightly but nothing that worries
me
if you have dry skin I don't think
you're going to need to set this
foundation at all but I don't find it
too drying either like I don't know
think you really like it so I'm going to
quickly put on some concealer underneath
my eyes in between my eyebrows and you
know the whole deal just to hide at my
dark circles and to add a little bit of
light here so that my foundation looks a
little bit more even and I don't have a
new concealer to use so I'm just going
to be using my collection lasting
perfection concealer in the shade fair
and I'm also using the wooden wild
highlighting and concealing pen on top
in the shade ivory into you and then I'm
just going to set that with my RC amino
color powder because I don't have any
new products to use for concealer
okay so I was going to go ahead and set
the rest of my face with a brand new
product that is purchased I just
purchased maybe like three weeks ago
before my no buy I purchased it before
my no buy I'm serious your site where
you guys are going to be like really all
of these products in this video were
either sent to me or I purchased them
the majority of this I purchased myself
but it was before my know bye I really
wanted to try this out today this is the
coefficient oh my
bunchy I don't know how that works
natural lighting powder it's just a
loose powder it's not kind of loosen and
has like a warm yellowy color to it but
when you swatch it it doesn't come off
like that it comes off like pretty light
but there's like glitter all around it I
don't know I'm actually really scared to
try this because I have feeling I'm not
going to like it but I don't know it
might surprise me and might be really
good but I'm scared to use it because
this foundation is already pretty matte
I don't want to just like mattify it
even more I'm just going to add a little
bit okay so I'm just going to do a
little bit I mean I'm going to cap off
like most of it just like I didn't know
I had all of these shimmers when I
bought it but I don't know I have to
play around with it a little bit more
but I feel like my face looks a little
bit shimmery when you look up close but
actually it's very slight you can't
really tell that much can you guys tell
I don't think sorry I don't know how I
feel about that just yet this is
definitely something I have to try on a
few times with different foundations and
different products underneath I'm going
to take the brown color we first use in
our crease and with this little Real
Techniques shading brush I'm going to
smudge that really close to my lower
lash line you definitely want to make
sure you're tapping off this this
product because it is so powdery that
you'll get it everywhere underneath your
eyes we don't tap off the excess on a
tiny little pencil brush this is the
zoeva 240 it's tiny I'm going to take
the shade we use on our entire lid and
I'm going to run this really really
close to my lower lashes
then with that same brush I'm going to
take this color right here that we use
on the outer corners on our lids and I'm
going to focus this on the outer corners
of the lower lash line then with that
first brush we use on our lower lash
line with that first color we used the
light brown I'm just going to blend
everything out so I want to add a pop of
color to my waterline and I'm going to
take the new Marc Jacobs eyeliner these
are the high liner gel crayons I know
that they've been around for a long time
but I think they recently changed the
formula or they recently revamped them
and launched them again they came out
with a ton of new colors they have the
metallic ones like this ones that are in
the shiny packaging and then they also
launch matte ones as well that come in a
matte packaging these were sent to me by
Marc Jacobs and I didn't really think
anything of them I was like oh cool new
eyeliners but when i swatched some on
the back of my hand yesterday and i try
to rub it off like an hour later they
were not moving like they would not
budge so I'm really excited to use this
I'm going to use a shade Orange Crush
which I know it's weird because it's
kind of like a Molly I shuttle looks but
I want to go in with like a peachy blush
and a kind of peachy tone lip so I want
everything to match I think it would be
cool to do like mauve and peach maybe
not we'll see
hopefully these stay on my waterline the
same way stayed on my hand it was crazy
I'm going to go back into the elf shadow
brow and miner palette and clean up my
brow bone again and then I'm going to
use this on my inner corners as well I
know it's Matt I am going to go over it
with my face highlight in a little while
but I'm just going to put this down as
kind of like a base it just brightens up
the inner corners a bit this is the
Catrice glam and off super black liner
haven't tried this out yet I'm just
going to add a very tiny tiny wing I was
really excited to use this eye liner
when I tried it on the back of my hand
yesterday because when i swatched it for
the first time it seems very matte and
very black which I really like so I'm
excited to give this a go I'm not the
best at winged eyeliner you guys know
this this is pretty good it seems to be
really black and matte but the tip it's
just a little bit hard to get a really
sharp line at the end I'm going to keep
using it I'll see how it goes
for mascara I'm going to use this guy
right here I just got this this is the
essence the false lashes mascara for
dramatic volume so I'm excited and
excited
okay so this isn't going to scare on my
eyes when you do it I think I really
like it I think I like it even more
without winged eyeliner underneath
because that way I could really tell a
difference it is a little bit clumpy
definitely not my favorite mascara but
essence is so affordable they think this
is a good mascara to try out if you're
in the market for something inexpensive
okay so the eyes are officially done now
I'm going to move on to my face more
flower beauty stuff to try out I'm so
excited
she came out with to lift and sculpt
contouring palette she came out with
this one in light to medium and this one
in medium to deep I had to go into a
Walmart to purchase these as opposed to
the other flower stuff that I got on the
Walmart website I got both of them just
to try them out but I think I'm going to
go with the light to medium this one
right here I'm going to try out this
bronzer right now I'm going to take my
multitask brush from Real Techniques
these are also very powdery when i
swatched them they're like looks little
a lot of stuff comes up so all of these
powder products are very soft you just
come in this onto my neck just because
that foundation was a little bit too
dark for me I like the color of this it
is warm well it's more of a pinky
bronzer as opposed to like a orange
bronzer okay so I think I really like
that I feel like it warmed up my skin
really nicely I'm not going to use the
highlight or the blush in this palette
just because she released an actual
highlighting palette and I want to give
this a go and she released some blushes
these are the two that I bought this one
is a more mafia called Sweet Pea so
beautiful and this one is called peach
Primrose I love the design of these
blushes they have a really beautiful
flower I'm going to use peach Primrose I
have been dying to put this on my face
since I got it I'm going to take this
little tart brush I got this in like a
holiday collection and
it's going to use that I think that is
so pretty it's not overly pigmented but
it gives you a beautiful flush of like a
peach I love it very impressed with this
I hope it lasts a long time on my skin
for highlight I'm going to use the
flower beauty shimmer and strobe
highlighting palette it says it's
long-lasting and it gives you a natural
luminous glow they look ultra metallic I
haven't tried on my cheeks but just
watching them I know I'm gonna like it
they have a really nice buttery formula
I'm going to take this shade right here
it's the lightest color usually I don't
like something so intense I like
something a little bit more natural but
I really really like these highlights
and put some of that on my nose and my
cupids pout
I'm going to take this pinky one in the
center I'm going to use that to
highlight my inner corner this is a
tight line brush by Urban Decay the e21
3 sometimes you get highlights at the
drugstore and you put them on and you're
like where's the highlight there's like
no highlight to this this however is
very highlighting so I really really
like those highlights really love that
bronzer that blush is beautiful now I'm
going to finish off the look with my lip
color I'm going to go in with this new
dose of colors liquid lipstick this is
the shade supernatural they just sent
this to me and I haven't tried it out
yet
okay so that completes this makeup look
I really love how it turned out really
quickly though I might as well just try
this out this is the alginate splash
hydrating setting mist and I recently
hauled this but I haven't even tried it
yet let me try it
hey Quinn is this like not fun spray on
this is weird as well I feel like I'm so
used to my Milani won this one doesn't
give me like a really good mist to where
it falls on my face I kind of have to
put it a lot closer because if I do this
like none of it falls on my face that is
a lot I feel like I have to spray a lot
to feel that on my face maybe because my
AC is on and it's like pushing the spray
that way when I'm trying to spray it
this way it does seem to be hydrating my
skin okay guys so that completes this
video I hope you enjoyed this chatty
full face first impressions video if you
want me to do more of these let me know
I love to gather like products to use on
my entire face that I've never used
before and then film me trying them on
