be a full face of first impression I'm
going to be trying out a bunch of new
products on my face some of these are
new to me they're not exactly new
releases but I have never personally
tried them out before so I will be
giving you my first impressions on those
two but a lot of these are brand new
releases and also going to be giving you
my thoughts on the UH Nastasia
subculture palette it's what I have on
my eyes right now and this video is a
thousand years long I just I already
know so I just finished filming it but I
don't want to drag this intro on too
long so without further ado if you want
to see my first impressions on a ton of
products then just keep watching okay so
I'm going to start off with the eye
makeup I'm going to be diving into the
new on a saucy of subculture palette I
just got back from LA so I wasn't able
to play with this earlier but it is here
now and I know there's a lot of
controversy around this palette and
honestly my honest and modern
renaissance palette has a lot of Fallout
not as much as this one does I haven't
used mine yet but from the videos I've
seen my modern renaissance on it does
not have that much fallout but it still
has still a lot of kick up my issue is
how it works on the eye because if you
just use like a very light hand and you
just put your brush right into the
product I mean a lot comes off it's
still usable unless it just doesn't
blend well on the eyes and I've seen a
lot of videos where these eye shadows
just don't really work on the ice it's
so weird that is what concerns me not so
much the kick up the pickup is crazy
because I've seen a lot of people like
hit pan so fast but anyway we're going
to use this for the first time today I'm
going to give you my opinion at my first
impressions now I have already primed my
lids and I'm going to take the shade dot
right here and I'm going to use this to
set down my eyeshadow primer
now I'm going to take the shade new wave
this one does have a lot of pickup as
you can see the other major downside to
kick up obviously is that you're
probably going to go through these
shadows a lot quicker while this one is
super pigmented I have enough to put it
on both of my eyes probably will go
through products a little bit quicker
but I mean if you can see this eyeshadow
so pigmented that I really didn't need
to dip my brush in that many times I'm
going to take a little bit of Roxy which
is this really pretty pinky shade see
I've seen a lot of videos where people
dip into this palette and just go like
this and the powder slides everywhere so
I don't know if mine is different but
the kick up isn't as terrible as I've
seen I think there is a batch problem
like there were a ton of pallets that
weren't pressed correctly I don't know
if I'm making that up and I'm pretty
sure I read that somewhere I'm taking a
little bit of Roxy and I'm just going to
apply this in like the same areas
but I'm not blowing it out as much as I
did with the yellow color I'm going to
go back into new wave and just add some
more except I'm going to take a little
bit of this shade right here cause
all-stars I'm just going to apply this
is so pigmented I'm a little weird okay
you definitely do not need to dip your
brush that many times into the pan just
use a very very light hand and you will
pick up a lot of pigment so that could
be a little intimidating for those of
you who don't really work with
eyeshadows
the shade does get a little bit muddy as
you're blending it it just doesn't look
as plummy when you apply to the lid it
almost get a little darker like it
oxidizes but I really really like the
other two shades I've used so far it
just gets a little muddy I'm gonna go
back into new wave I love this shade
it's so good so opens it I'm just going
to blend out that crease a little bit
because it got a little grey in the
crease with that all-star shade I really
want to use this shade adorned right
here and I'm probably going to end up
using mac's fix+ with this just because
shimmery eyeshadows just apply so much
better with fix+
yeah that's what I'm going to do
and I'm going to bring this color almost
till the end that I'm not going to bring
it all the way to the eggs I'm going to
put another eyeshadow there anyway with
all the fun colors that are in this
palette I like it though if I'm doing so
wait Kathleen now I'm going to take a
little bit of this color called edge
right here and I am going to run this
directly into the crease just to blend
everything out I'm going to take this
shade of fudge which by the way I find
it so weird that they included a shade
in this palette called fudge when they
already have an eyeshadow called fudge
but it's not the same color they're both
brown but this one is much warmer and
they're just not the same brown so I
don't find out this about that's a
little weird I'm just going to buff this
color right here into the kree
and I'm also using this shade to kind of
blend the gold and the brown together
I'm going to go back and blend the edges
of this eyeshadow in a second I'm going
to take a little bit of this rally shade
like the dark dark dark purple and this
is what I'm going to use to deep it out
the outer corners here I'm going to go
back into the shade new wave but I'm not
going to apply too much of this because
this is a super pigmented eyeshadow and
we're really going to dub it off and I
am just going to blow out this crease so
it could look a little bit more blended
and not so harsh
okay so major thing I don't like about
this palette is that there really isn't
a light highlight shade if we have cube
here but it has a super strong pink
undertone it's like a dual chrome so I'm
going to dip into another eyeshadow or
highlight I should say I'm going to take
the Wet n Wild highlight in golden
flower crown and I'm going to use this
to highlight the brow bone I'm also
going to use this on the inner corners
I'm going to apply some more after I do
my face makeup because most likely this
will get blended away I'm going to wipe
away some of this fallout I thought I
was going to be a lot worse but it
wasn't too bad and now I'm going to
quickly move on to the face before I
finish up the eye
ok the primer I'm going to be trying out
is the Smashbox photo finish primer Iser
it is a primer and moisturizer in one
when I saw that they were releasing this
I got really excited because that sounds
like a dream for me it does it has
hyaluronic acid and niacinamide don't
know what that is but it has it and I'm
just going to shake this pump it onto my
fingers and put on my legs whoo feels
like water that's extremely slippy holy
crap never found a primer this wet
is that weird okay it's starting to sink
into the skin and it gets a little
thicker like it feels a little bit more
moisturizing and not so watery I think I
like this though my skin actually feels
like plump and hydrated though the
foundation I'm going to be using is not
very new this has been out for a long
time now but this is the Maybelline
Dream cushion liquid foundation on the
go I have not tried this it's been
sitting on my vanity for months now I
picked up the shade 30 warm nude now
that I have a little bit of tan going on
I'm going to use my Beauty Blender with
this I know I should have used a little
cushion thing that comes with this but
I've never used those you know it's
meant to be used with that but I just I
never use those so with this kind of eye
makeup I probably should have gone with
something more full coverage but do you
think cushion foundation you think sheer
lightweight not a lot of coverage but I
feel like this cushion foundation has a
little bit more coverage than I'm used
to with a cushion actually you know what
probably would be better with this a
brush i'ma try brush
you know I thought I wasn't going to
like this I thought it was going to be I
don't know what I thought but I really
didn't think I was going to like this
foundation but I think I do it looks
really really natural but it has a soft
doing is to it
soft do enos does that even make sense
for concealer I do have a new concealer
to try out but it's way too light for me
so this is the Revlon use fix fill in
the blur concealer and I got the shade
light so I am going to be mixing it I'm
going to apply Oh see what happens when
you're impatient oh I just hate clicky
things actually this color might be okay
we just go in this out somehow the color
is good besides my foundation is looking
a little dark so I think this is a
pretty decent concealer I don't know I
don't really have anything negative to
say but it's not like amazing this is
weird too it's not thick or anything I
like how it's blending out that's such a
savage and I think the coverage is
pretty good it's not extremely full
coverage but I think it covers enough it
leaves you a little dewy which I like a
little hydrated my under eyes don't look
dry or anything and I like how it looks
on the face like not just under the eyes
I like it I like it to highlight with
it's very creamy um on the rest of my
face
it just blends so easily to like boom
buh buh blended alright let's set that
under eye concealer shall we
I'm going to be using the new pixie
quick fix powder and this is in the
shade translucid and the packaging is
really strange it has this like puff
thing and the product is down here and
it goes through the puff like I don't
know if you can see the powder and
that's how you use it on your face you
kind of stamp it but I do want to use a
different powder on the rest of my face
so I'm only going to be using this
underneath my eyes and the places I
applied concealer so I'm going to open
this like this I'm really going to focus
this powder right underneath the eyes
I'm not going to bring this down because
I'm going to use a liquid highlighter
this does leave you really smooth like
it smooths out the skin here underneath
the eyes and it doesn't look drying on
the skin my only concern is the extreme
white powder I'm going to take a flash
test at the end of this and I'll let you
know if there's any flashbacks
alrighty before I apply powder to the
rest of my face I'm going to try this
bad boy out this bad boy this is the new
Anastacio liquid glow face highlighter
I'm so excited to try this
I'm going to use a shade Perla or bad
luck you can see how it looks swatch
right there super intense and let's see
how this apply I'm nervous like what
highlight makes me so nervous
I really like that it does look super
subtle but it catches the light really
nicely I don't think it's as good as the
cover of specs liquid highlights but
it's probably not as expensive either
this definitely dries down pretty
quickly so you do have to work with it
fast but it is nice that it does this so
it doesn't stay like sticky or tacky on
the skin because when I touch my cheek
it doesn't feel like I have a liquid
highlight on it anymore I have to play
around with it a little bit more of a
base off first impressions I totally
like this very pretty
now I'm just going to apply some powder
on my entire face I just want a light
dusting of those powder just to try it
out this is they're translucent press
Beauty powder and it is called the
Luminizer so it is a shimmery like
iridescent shiny kind of powder I love a
little bit of a sheen to the skin it's
really really subtle but I can see I
have to look really closely this is me
just dissecting the crap out of this so
I look really closely you can see little
silver specks on my face and you could
really see it here in the powder there's
a little silver glitter throughout this
and I wish there wasn't I wish it was
more of like a sheen just like a natural
sheen but it does have those little
specks of glitter um yeah I don't know
how I feel about this just yet I will
play around with it a little bit more
but the little glitters that are thrown
throughout the sheen kind of put me off
okay so really quickly I'm going to
finish up my eye makeup oh right what do
I want to use with well and use I want
to use colors that I haven't used yet
I'm going to take the shade axis right
here this color is so pretty and just
gonna
okay I know that looks really aggressive
I know it looks really aggressive but we
will go in and fix that I'm going to
take the essence gel eye pencil in the
shade Blue Lagoon I've actually never
used this on my eyes before so I'm using
this on the waterline oh wow I really
like this eye liner also going to
tightline with this might as well okay
so now I blend everything out I'm going
to take a new wave I'm going to blend
right underneath that blue color at
bluish-green out just at my eye now for
the finishing foot I'm going to take
rowdy and I am going to apply this right
on the outer corners just to match the
top lid here at the edge I know this
look calls for falsies but I'm not going
to put them on I love wearing falsies
I'm gonna rock it totally does complete
a look it looks way better
sometimes I'm content with just mascara
kind of extending the lower lash line
here on the outer parts so it looks kind
of like a wing for like a bottom wing
taking anymore product of just extending
it with my brush or don't have a new
mascara to try out so I'm going to apply
my mascara off-camera and I'll be right
back but I'm going to be using the
cookie volume and length mascara okay so
I think I got a good palette like I said
earlier I'm pretty sure novena address
the fact that there were inconsistencies
with the batches or with the palette
these do have a ton of fallout they have
a ton of kick up but mine don't have as
much as I seen on YouTube I've seen tons
of videos on this palette and some of
these were like bad some of these
weren't even blending people had a ton
of fallout some be more hitting pans but
do I think it's good I do I really do
think it's good I love the eye look I
created with this I didn't have any
issues the only eye shadow I do not like
at all is all sorry but the rest of the
colors I use I know I really like it and
no I know that's a super unpopular
opinion but I think I got one of the
good palettes and if you're someone who
got a bad palette contact customer
service and I'm sure they will sort
things out but if you haven't purchased
I would say hold off and wait until
maybe they fix the issue and then
purchase it anyway let's move on to the
rest of the face we are almost done okay
so sometimes I will buy something just
based on packaging alone even if it's
expensive sometimes packaging does
things to me and I bought this I'm sorry
but this is a Chanel bronzer this is the
the beige healthy glow luminous color
hopefully the bronzer is actually good
so it does feel a little dusty like I
put my brush in there and a little dusty
but we shall see I'm just going to get
my iron brush in there
I I do not like the scent of this
bronzer oh my gosh
it's so strong whoa a lot of their stuff
is heavily fragranced which is why I
don't really purchase anything from
Chanel which is why I don't really
purchase from a lot of luxury brands
some companies put so much fragrance in
their product that it kind of like
fiddles me off I'm not seeing like much
color show all of my skin this is
probably a little bit too light for my
tan right now nonetheless product is
really showing up which could be a good
thing for those of you who like a really
simple natural makeup it's not super
pigmented so you don't need a light hand
with it actually I need a heavy hand
with this I don't think I like this I'm
actually pretty shocked because I
expected to like it I feel like it's not
doing anything and this is like $60 so
nah nah I'm going to take my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer that's what I'm
talking about that's what I'm talking
about definitely a major Sims down to
that bronzer am I being too critical or
was that like not even showing a sense
that's awesome
we better do more than that okay so for
blush I do want to try this out I don't
know if this will go with my look but
Joseph colors came out with an entire
mint collection this one is the blush
like you mint it blush and this one is
called amazement and it's just like a
really pretty peachy pink with some gold
a little bit I'm being very subtle with
the way I'm applying this but I like it
the golden sheen isn't too much
sometimes I don't like shimmery blushes
because it'll make your pores look
really large but the sheen in this blush
is very subtle the golden undertone is
just right and there isn't any chunky
glitter in this very well done dose of
colors I like this blush so for
highlight I'm actually going in with
this guy
I had it for a while but I haven't tried
it on my face I don't feel like I'm
gonna like this because I don't love the
other rainbow highlighter by wedding
miles but this one is all gold so maybe
I'll like it
it's called bronze over the rainbow I
just didn't love the formula of the
other one either it wasn't just the
colors they didn't like the formula but
I'm going to stay in this range right
here where it's like the lightest shade
by the way this is a brush from Sephora
that was like a trillion dollars it's
from a brand called stir rot and
honestly it was the most expensive brush
in the world but I don't regret buying
it I love using this to highlight yeah I
don't like this I like this I don't like
the formula of this it's just too chunky
it's not a sheen if you guys had a
dollar for every time I've ever said
sheen on my channel be rich girl boy I
just feel like it's so chunky and
glittery and just I don't like this
we're going to fix that with a little
bit of setting spray setting spray
always tones down a highlight and makes
it look more natural so that's what
we're doing I don't have a new setting
spray to try out so I'm just going to
use my morphe one I know it sold out so
I hate using this list
I'll let that dry sink right into the
skin and the highlight is going to
become one with the skin okay now that I
have banned myself down by the way best
purchase on Amazon I've ever made
I'm going to be using a new lipstick I
have never tried before this isn't brand
new or anything but it's pretty new to
her line this is me Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick in the shade to talk which she
has a super iconic lip liner called
pillow talk and I love that one I
haven't used it in so long but it was my
go-to for a long time and she released a
lipstick shade until talked so I'm going
to apply it to see how easy this is like
a your lips but better shade it's a
little deeper I love how this lipstick
filled it is so creamy so comfortable
and just so amazing they also smell
amazing they smell like MAC lipsticks
but they're way better than MAC
lipsticks the formula is ten times
better than max okay guys so that
completes this video these were my first
impressions on everything I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know if
you like these videos I'll do them more
often I love just trying out a bunch of
products for you guys and yeah thank you
