another full face first impression I
know a lot of people have been doing
these videos recently but I find them so
entertaining so I thought I would do
another one because you guys seem to
really like my last one all the products
I'm going to be trying on my face I have
never tried them on my face before I've
only like swatch them and stuff like
that so I cannot wait to try these
products out a lot of them are brand new
but some of them are not
I just haven't personally tried them so
it's like they're new to me so yeah I
know this video is going to be a million
years on so I'm going to get started my
lips are so dry and chapped and red it's
been so cool here Miami cold for me I'm
going to take the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD lip booster and I'm just going to put
this on my mouth just to give me a
little bit of moisture I've heard a lot
of great things about this so okay so
I'm going to pry my skin using this guy
I just purchased this I've never tried
it before I got it at Ulta this is the
Mary perfect press neutralizing primer
and I've never heard anyone talk about
this primer before I thought it was
going to be like a green color to maybe
neutralize redness but it's a skin tone
color and it feels kind of like it
honestly it feels like a foundation and
okay just gonna read them machines I
think it's a little pink I don't know
well maybe ice cuz I'm rubbing my face
my face always gets red it's so weird it
feels like a tinted moisturizer okay so
this is the primer on my face
obviously you can't tell because it's a
primer but I feel like it evened out my
skin tone a little bit it probably has
like really sheer coverage I don't know
I don't know how I feel about this um I
think it might be good but I have to
play with it a little bit more the
foundation I'm going to be using today
is from the brand stellar stellar is a
new makeup brand they just started
selling at Sephora and when I saw how
pretty this foundation was like in the
packaging I knew I wanted to get it I
really don't know anything about this
brand I haven't heard anything about it
though I wanted to take a chance and I
picked up this foundation it is the
unless foundation I got the shade so1
and I also got the shade so3 because I
bought it online I didn't know what my
color was but this one seems like it's
going to match me i swatched it on my
hand last night and it seems like a
really good match this is a very nice
super watery but pretty running and I'm
going to take my pure sponge and I'm
just going to start applying this to my
face I know it's kind of stupid to test
a primer and a foundation on the same
day because sometimes certain primers
don't work with certain foundations and
vice versa so kind of stupid to try them
both at the same time but for the sake
of this video I'm you know that's
overdoing so I would say this has like a
medium coverage it's applying really
nicely on the skin it seems to be pretty
dewy
you can see like there's a glow to my
skin let me read you the claims of this
foundation as I'm applying it because
just like you well maybe not but I have
no idea what this foundation is about I
just purchased it to try it so the
foundation on me Sephora website only
has one review but they gave it 5 stars
so this says it's an oil-free innovative
highly pigmented medium coverage meaning
covers like it's foundation that lets
you build to full coverage where it's
needed I'm going to add a little bit to
my Beauty Blender of my son and I'm just
going to build a color the coverage
right here ok so I definitely think it
covered a little bit more and it didn't
get cakey or anything looking at my skin
up close it looks really healthy and
really dewy it's not cakey around my
nose which you guys know is like my
problem area it's settling into my lines
but everything does every time my friend
Gaby does my makeup for photo shoots
just to like stand there behind the
scenes with a little brush to smooth out
my smile lines because foundation just
love to sit in there but you know that's
my face I don't like that it's tacky to
the touch like when I put my fingers up
to my face like it's definitely a little
tacky but that's the case with some dewy
foundation I think I like this I think
it is pretty nice foundation is
definitely one of those products I have
to try out a few times to give you a
more well-rounded opinion because
foundation first impressions for me are
always like well I don't know I mean
okay so I'm going to go in with
concealer now and I wanted to try out
the stellar concealer but look at this
color compared to this foundation this
is so dark and this is in the shade so1
this is the one this is also one that
makes no sense it's way too dark for my
skin tone and it's actually the lightest
shade they have I assumed it was going
to be a very similar color to the
foundation but much too dark so we're
going to try out this guy instead which
I'm actually more excited about this one
than that stellar concealer this is the
wet and wild photo focus concealer I
love the photo focus foundation but I
had heard a few negative reviews on this
concealer so I didn't want to buy it I
just wanted to test it out for myself
and see what I thought so when I apply
this underneath my eyes I'm in the shade
well I got the shade light ivory and I'm
going to blend that in with my sponge I
think I like it
it looks pretty matte but I don't mind
that at all for me it really does depend
how I'm feeling I'll either go for a
matte concealer or a really dewy one it
depends on the look I'm going for but I
like this I don't think it looks cakey
it might look like slightly more dry but
I think it blends really really well and
the coverage is really good so I'm just
gonna add a little Mole just to see what
happens
oh my gosh I think I really like this
it's just blending out so well and it
sinks right into the skin and it gives
you like a soft matte look I'm going to
add a little bit on the rest of my face
no bad not bad at all I really like that
concealer I shouldn't have put them on
my eyelids because I'm going to try out
a primer but I completely forgot anyway
before I set my concealer and my face
with powder I'm going to go in with this
guy and I'm actually really nervous to
do this this is the hoola kwikki contour
stick they just sent this to me and I
was not a fan at all of their liquid
hoola bronzer it was way too orange so
when I thought I came out with a stick
version I was a little bit nervous that
it's going to be too orange
it looks okay it looks like it might be
a little warm but let's just let's just
let's just try it ever since I
discovered the cover effects liquid
bronzer I already like to use any other
liquid bronzer honestly I wasn't
terrible that pretty much blended into
nothing so a little more
it's definitely definitely a little bit
cooler than their liquid hula it's not
as orange but it's not ashy which
sometimes Ashley contours just don't
work if you have a yellow undertone if
you have a lot of warmth to your skin
sometimes those cool tone contours can
look a little too muddy and in my
opinion it is really easy to blend I
like this I think it's pretty good do I
think my cover of X 1 is better
absolutely the cover of x1 is amazing
ridiculously overpriced it's so crazy
how much those cover effects drops are I
like this is definitely a winner so far
ok so now I'm going to set down my
foundation because it's still tacky and
I'm going to set my concealer I have a
brand new powder to try out it's a loose
powder and the packaging is to die for
this is my favorite packaging on a loose
powder this is the Fiona Styles
invisible finish loose setting powder
and I got the shade white stone it's
kind of like a translucent color the
packaging is awesome this right here is
soft touch ignores packaging and the top
is just so pretty I've been slowly
testing out Fiona stylist product and
just recently bought an eyeshadow
palette from her and I got this too so
slowly starting to try out more and more
of her products so I'm going to test
this bad boy out today comes with a
little puppy thing which I never really
use I haven't even opened it oh I'm
going to smooth out my under eye
concealer just in case of a creased to
take away some of those creases I'm
going to use my Smith 1 line to brush
with it in these products set my
concealer
I'm gonna take some more on the cap I'm
just going to set the rest of my face
with this because you know this
Filmation easily Becky should be using a
bigger brush but that would require me
to stand up who needs this many loose
setting powders I don't know okay so
looking at my skin that didn't look
powdery on my face at all I don't think
it emphasized my dryness maybe a little
bit here on my chin but it's not
something that's going to make me like
never want to wear this powder again I
still love my RCM a no color powder more
I think that one really looks invisible
on my skin but this one is not bad yeah
I don't think I have anything bad to say
about this so for a powder bronzer I'm
going to take the hoola light by benefit
benefit just released hoola in a lighter
version i've swatched this and this is
like way too light for my skin tone I
think this would work for you if you are
very very porcelain like super fair then
this would be perfect for you but for me
I mean based on my swatch I don't I
don't know if this can work for me so
I'm gonna take my Wayne Goss brush
number fourteen and I'm just going to
use this to contour a little it smells
amazing though my other hoola does not
smell like this it smells so good okay
maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong looking
a little weird though on top of the
other
bronzer looking a little patchy right
there I mean it's definitely showing up
on my skin I didn't think it was going
to because it looks so light in the pan
but that is looking pretty splotchy
maybe it's the way I'm applying it but I
mean I apply bronzer every day so I
don't know
I would imagine that those of you who
are really sensitive to cents in your
product I don't know if you would like
this because it is pretty heavily
fronted it's a very good scent but it is
a little perfuming I mean it's about a
little bit more I think I might like it
a bit play around with it more doesn't
right now I'm still on the fence and I'm
not exactly sure if I like this I'm
hoping that because they came out with a
who the light that they're going to come
out with like a hula deep or something
like that because their original hula
can work for fair skin if you apply a
really light hand but it does not work
for deeper skin tones so I'm hoping
they're going to release like another
one paper skin tone
I would hope okay so I'm just going to
go ahead and start on my eye makeup
because I don't want to do a full face
about knowing what's going on with my
eyes first so let's start on that we're
going to be playing with the new color
pop eyeshadow palette this is the blow
me away palette color pops just launched
a whole nectar range it's beautiful it's
kind of like so you can create a
monochromatic look and they're all like
peachy nectar orange shades so stunning
they have blush lippies eyeshadows is
really beautiful and they also just
released a pink version I don't like
pink as much as I like nectar but
they're both really beautiful and
they're just releasing different phases
I think the next one is sand and they're
all like sand colored makeup so anyway
today we're going to be using the blow
me away palette so I'm going to start
out with this color right here this
color is called issues I really wish
color pop would just leave the names on
the actual packaging they sell it with a
sleeve over it that has the names of the
colors and the names of the palette but
once you take the sleeve and you like
throw it away it doesn't have the names
on them and I'm going to take my Sephora
Pro crease brush and I'm going to build
that color in my crease oh wait I kept
waiting for help primer because it look
like my eyes are a little primes I'm
going to go in with the brand new
Smashbox photo-finish lid primer in the
shade light they came out with a few new
colors a white one a light one a deeper
one and I think like a smoky color and
they just sent this to me and I'm going
to try it out
a nice little primer but I'm really
really nervous because I have never been
a huge fan of smash Smashbox primers I
know that they're like so raved about
but hopefully this eye primer is you
know something that will work for me it
looks a little bit splotchy because I
forgot to take out the concealer I had
underneath that idea Kathleen bad idea
my first impression videos are always
going to be a little messy okay now
we're going to go in with issues I know
of colors like this in my crease oh I
love warm peachy crease shades so much
so I fell on the primer like I said but
I have a little bit of concealer left
underneath so I feel like it didn't
apply as smoothly as it normally would
but so far so good my eyeshadow is going
on really nicely it looks very pigmented
okay so that's issues and I love this
color my hair is frizzy asked today okay
so now I'm actually going to take
something else for my lid I'm going to
take this new milk makeup eye pigment
this is in the shade hotel lobby I've
never tried these before they were
recently sent to me I gave most of them
to my friends because I rarely use
products like this but I kept like
they're really beautiful bronzy shades
and I'm going to take some on my finger
I've never tried it
Memphis hang-up I'm just gonna apply
this to my lids
I heard coffee from glam life guru say
that these are like really amazing I'm
just gonna oh that might have been too
much she said these were really amazing
and they stay in place all day so I'm so
excited to see I'm gonna leave a note in
my description box letting you know how
the foundation wore throughout the day
and how this eye pigment worth about
today because they both claim to be
pretty long wearing actually I'm going
to go in with something right on top of
this so I'm able to tell 100% seems like
a really pretty golden champagne color
I'm going to go back in with that brush
I was using earlier and just blend
I'm going to go back into the blow me
away palette and I'm going to pick this
first shade this is called take a break
and I'm going to apply this to my entire
lid using this Real Techniques little
eyeshadow brush nope not going to use
this eyeshadow brush I'm going to take
the mess 242 and pop that on actually
you know what I'm going to use my
fingers blend some more now I'm going to
go in with this color right here this
one is called centerfold and on a
different crease brush from I take the
morphe r38
and I'm going to apply this to my outer
corners and in my crease a little bit
see how my Kaname can do I stay a little
bit all the time you can't help but I'm
going to notice it yeah I definitely
100% think I should have tested this out
without adding the milk pigment
I think the milk pigment is perfect on
its own but I don't know if I like it
layered under other eyeshadows at all
I'm going to go back into that first
color and I'm going to apply some more
just to intensify a little bit because
some of it was like blended away then
I'm going to take a smut and it's a tiny
crease brush this is the lucky 237 and
I'm going to take what is it called slim
stick I believe and I'm going to apply
some of this right in the outer corners
like right here I guess I am bringing
that into the crease a little bit why
not I'm going to go back into that first
shade we used my favorite shaytans
palette hands down and I'm just going to
blend out my crease making sure there
are no harsh line now I'm going to take
this color right here and I'm going to
run that underneath my lower lash line
and then I'm going to take this color
right here with the same brush first
color we use and I'm going to blend it
all out okay so that stop palette I
actually really like the colors I don't
like the fact that I added the milk
pigment underneath because I feel like
it created a weird texture on my lid but
besides that everything blended out
really nicely and issues is my favorite
candy makes this permanent because I
think it's that pretty I really really
like that eyeshadow so I'm just going to
apply some eyeliner this is not new this
is not a first impression this is the
Marc Jacobs tie liner matte gel crayon
in the shade earthquake and I'm just
going to apply it up to my waterline and
I'm going to tightline with this as well
okay so I just took the eyeliner and
really smudged it underneath my lower
lash line just to add a little bit of
depth and a little bit more of like a
dark brown to the look because I thought
it was just a little too bold and
colorful
I wish out a new liquid liner to try or
something but I don't so I'm just going
to go ahead and move on to mascara this
is a mascara from the brand stellar the
same Brent for my foundation this is the
absolute mascara and I just went on the
Sephora website to tell you like the
claims and stuff and this is actually
currently sold out I bought it a few
days ago so I must have just sold out
it's supposed to achieve volume length
and drama in an instant we shall see
about that
it has longer bristles at the top and
then shorter ones at the bottom or you
know longer ones at the bottom when
shorter ones at the top and I usually
don't like rubber one I'm more of a
natural bristle kind of gal but let's
give this a try
I love the benefit roller lash and that
is rubber so you never know
my lashes here at the side are always
like so much longer and it looks like
there's a gap right here do you see that
I hate that okay so these are my lashes
my initial first impression is that it's
really volumizing it's really dramatic
but I think it makes my eyelashes look a
little strange
like not even kind of like all over the
place
so far I don't hate it but it's not my
favorite okay so now we can go ahead and
just finish the rest of my face makeup
I'm going to take this color pop nectar
duo it's technically called the pressed
powder face duo and this is in the shade
the knockout it is stunning I got so
excited when I saw this online because
as you guys know I'm not a huge fan of
color pop blushes there's super shock
cheek like their original blushes
they're a little bit difficult for me to
work with there are a couple that I do
really like that apply nicely but for
the most part I always just reach for a
powder blush so when I saw the color pop
released a powder blush I got really
excited this color is called
excuse my friend and then this is the
highlighter in the palette and this is
called like to watch so I'm just going
to go in with the blush today I'm going
to use this brush I just purchased the
Linda Hallberg brushes I purchased her
infinity palette and her brushes and how
beautiful is this brush this is the 310
brush and I'm going to use this to apply
my blush so this is so pretty I have
been waiting to use this Bubbe Bubbe
what I'll be honest a puppy and baby and
Bobbie came out humm bully I'm your
white knight if anyone can guess where
thats from you are my truest truest
truest best friend because that's like
one of my favorite movies of all time
I'm going to go in with the smashbox
spotlight palette in the shade pearl
this is casey holmes newest highlighting
palette and i'm so excited i just
purchased this on with sephora website
this looked right at my street i
swatched all of them and they look
really really beautiful I'm gonna take
my Linda Hallberg 306 brush and I'm
going to take this color in the middle
and I'm going to pop that on my cheeks
top of my chain so pretty that looks
actually really natural on the skin
oh satisfied okay so I'm going to take a
little bit of this color right here it's
either blow a fuse or turn it on I'm
going to pop it right on top here okay
so this is the highlight on my face I
really really like it good job Casey
congratulations eboot the finish off
this look all I have to do is apply my
lip color and I'm going to line with a
few different things I'm going to take
this this is the buxom plump line lip
liner in the shade White Russian which
you know is my favorite lip gloss of all
time and they came out with a White
Russian lip liner Singh
I've tried one other plump line lip
liner before this but I've never tried
this color before and these are pretty
good they're a little drying for my
liking and I'm just going to fill in my
lips a little bit with this color is
like concealer baby pink concealer the
lip color I'm going to use is this guy
right here this is the new Gerlach sick
matte lip paint in the shade blushing
and he's so good easy this is just a
little bolder than I would like for this
I look so I'm gonna tone it down a bit
I'm so very beautiful color so I'm going
to take this brand new makeup geek creme
stain in the shade curtsies I thought
the shade was crusty and I'm gonna apply
this to my lips
she sent me all of her new colors and I
don't know if I like this packaging
please leave me a comment down below
what do you think I like that the top is
soft matte and I like the idea of it but
I don't know if I loved it maybe I'm
just crazy so I'm just going to apply a
little bit of this color it's like a
very pretty speech and I'm going to
apply it on top and then I'm going to
blend it in a little bit
okay now I like the lips with this eye
look I don't know how I feel about these
yet and today I just use it to lighten
up this lip color so I mean I didn't
apply much I can't really tell you much
about this but if you are wondering
makeup geek came out with a ton of
colors and these are their showstopper
creme stains these will be available to
purchase on March 23rd not going to do a
lip swatch video because when I open the
package I had a ton of friends over and
I let them pick their favorite colors to
take home so I don't have all of them
with me but I will still update you in
another video about the formula and
stuff anyway that's it for my lip color
I didn't want it right here is so puffy
what is happening I didn't want to apply
a little bit of this highlight to my
inner corners because the color pop
palette didn't really have an inner
corner highlight and I'm going to apply
some underneath my eyebrows okay guys so
that completes this video this was a
full face of first impression and I hope
you guys enjoy videos like this we may
comment down below if you want me to do
more of these I would say overall I
think the majority of the products
