a full-face first impressions I know my
last video was the first impressions
they're like a review on a product where
I tried it out for the first time and
today there's another one I'm so sorry
but I just recently got a bunch of
makeup from the brand Cokie
professionals this is what it looks like
I purchased all of this stuff on Walmart
this is like a brand new brand that I've
never really heard before I got a COPI
nail polish in an Ipsy bag or a boxy
charm
I actually I think it was boxycharm I
got a nail polish from them and I had
never heard of the brand and then I had
no idea that they did makeup I went on
to Walmart calm and I purchased a ton of
Cokie makeup and we're going to try them
out today too the very first time on
camera this is a pretty affordable bread
I mean it sold at Walmart I would say
it's around the price point of like
Maybelline or L'Oreal like those kind of
prices so yeah I'm really excited to do
this video today because I haven't tried
anything from this brand just their nail
polish and I bought everything to create
a full face of makeup except blush I
don't know if I didn't notice that isn't
in your blush or there wasn't any blush
on the website I I just had a hush also
my tripod broke I'm currently using it
but I have to be like very careful with
it because I'm not I will I just fall
apart I have to get in a tripod off I'm
sick I have a cold I came back from
Vegas and now I have a cold I don't know
why that happens to me I have a really
bad immune system anyway let's get
started on this video okay so I'm going
to start out with primer this is the
Cokie professional smooth glow hydrating
foundation primer I'm not going to say
the name of the brown every time I grab
a product because this whole video is
about cookie that's going to get
annoying some try a little bit if there
is a translucent foundation primer that
hydrates soothes perfects and evens out
the appearance of flaws for a
long-lasting healthy looking complexion
obviously I'm going to have to try this
out like separately with other
foundations I already own to see if it
really works but for the sake of this
video we're going to be I think of this
one because I do have really dry skin
but Cokie does have a mattifying primer
so if you have oily skin I would suggest
trying that one out so this just feels
like a really lightweight moisturizer it
smells like a moisturizer and by the way
this primer is 1098 which is I would say
for drugstore it is
a little pricier but like I said it's
like Maybelline and L'Oreal prices okay
so the only foundation and the cookie
range is the liquid cushion foundation
which I'm not excited to try because I
don't really have that much experience
with many cushion foundations I just
recently purchased the Maybelline one
and I haven't tried out the Maybelline
cushion foundation yet but this one is
from cookie and I picked up the shade 20
W which I'm assuming means warm I don't
even know what this looks like I haven't
even opened it gate
it watches a little bit lighter than it
looks in there so it might fit me nicely
since I've never tried out this
foundation before I usually always
applied my foundation with a Beauty
Blender but I'm going to try half of my
face with a brush and half of my face
with a Beauty Blender this is this acute
Beauty Blender you've ever seen it's not
coming off as vibrant on camera but in
person this is like a chartreuse yellow
green it's so intense I'm obsessed with
it it came in a set at Sephora it's like
a brand new little set that comes with
three Beauty blenders the regular pink
one and this amazing one and then like
an orange one I think and I got it just
goes with this color I love Li but
anyway I digress I'm going to take the
butt of the Beauty Blender
stamp it in there FedEx just got here
the dogs are gonna scream and I'm going
to go in like that okay so it might be
too light for me actually nothing a
little bronzer can fix let me give you
in a little okay so I would say that the
Beauty Blender has like a solid medium
coverage it did cover up the birthmark a
heaven between my brows pretty good so I
think the coverage is really nice on
this product the only thing I will say
is that this is like taking up around my
nose let me show you okay I don't know
if you could even say that it's getting
cakey for the rest of my skin I really
do like this finish it's a little tacky
but it looks really natural on the skin
okay so now I'm going to do the rest of
my face with a brush feel like not a lot
of product comes out but
okay so I find that patting it in with a
brush is better than rubbing it in with
a brush feel like rubbing it in makes it
look uneven and it kind of gives you
streak marks finish wise I definitely
prefer the side with the Beautyblender
I'm just going to go over it so that
everything blends nicely I just feel
like it blends better into the skin with
a Beauty Blender and it doesn't sit on
the skin like it did with the brush if
you notice my tripod start to like it's
broken
okay let's try out some concealer this
is the be bright illuminating concealer
I like the sound the light so just good
enough to win this - Muffy I got the
shade fair I'm gonna take a little bit
of that onto my eyes because I didn't
get an eyelid primer I don't even know
if they make one I'm going to do one eye
at a time just in case oh wow it's
pretty good coverage photograph I
thought it was going to be extremely
sheer which is why I applied so much
I don't know when something says
illuminating concealer I get the
impression that it's going to be sheer
and light weight and a little dewy and
not so much coverage but no no this has
really really good coverage but I like
it it does feel really sticky it's a
very tacky concealer probably because
it's not matte does have more of us
illuminating qualities but it's not
greasy I go ahead and do the other side
I'm going to apply just as much because
you know I need thanks to the even
okay so first impressions on my
concealer actually really liked it I
mean I have to try it out more but
initially I think I really liked it it
has full coverage in my opinion I mean I
did apply a lot and I think that with
this a little goes a long way I don't
think you need to do like those dramatic
triangles underneath the eyes that was
my mistake but all in all it was really
easy to blend into the skin I didn't
feel like it was too much too thick or
too cakey it was nice I'm going to set
my under eye concealer so we could put
some color into this so to set my entire
face actually wait yeah I'm missing my
entire face it's pretty tacky I'm going
to use the translucent setting powder
I'm going to take my Smith 1/2 brush
swirl it in this bad boy and set my god
now I'm going to take that same brush
and just dust it lightly on the rest of
my face I don't want to take a doing
this away from the foundation but it was
a little bit too tacky to just leave
like it okay so I'm going to be trying
out this bad boy we're really excited
when I saw this on the Walmart website
this is their powder contour palette
they do have a cream contour powders
that I didn't want to get because I
don't really love cream palettes like
for contouring but this is the powder
contour and it looks pretty much
identical to the Kat Von D shade + light
contour palette I don't have that one so
I can't compare it for you but it pretty
much has like this layout and it looks
very very similar so I'm excited to see
if I like you so most likely I will take
this one to contour with and then I'll
probably use this one to bronze my skin
a little bit normally if I look this
pale I would bronze up with like a
shimmery bronzer just to give some like
life and color back to my skin but let's
just try this out for you know looks
like it Olivia I'm going to take my Mac
1 4 0 s brush it's like a giant fluffy
fan brush but I use it for contouring
and just gonna be too great for me
though whatever let's try it Thibodeaux
hair is driving mid banana ok so I
actually think I really like that I
think it created a nice shadow this is
actually an extremely pigmented powder
if you buy this go in with a very light
hand really quickly I want to take that
same brush we used for the translucent
powder and I'm just going to mix these
two I'm gonna see if that like bright
and my under eye a little bit not really
okay with my makeup over 1/2 a tube
brush I'm going to take this color and
I'm just going to bronze the skin a
little bit
okay so I might have applied too much
might have gone a little bit overboard
but that's pretty much the contour and
bronze look I got from this and I love
how pigmented these are I feel like
maybe they're a little bit too pigmented
but if you tap off the brush you will
get a really nice smooth application I
didn't really notice much happening with
these two shades but that's probably
because I had already set my under eye
concealer I'm sure this works well to
set your concealer and I really like
these to contour powders this one is
obviously a little bit too dark for me
but if you have a deeper skin tone you
might really like these two shades so I
think is my favorite thing I've tried so
far now for blush I'm just going to
quickly pop on some wet and wild color
icon blush in the shade it rose
champagne with my little tart tapered
gold brush that I don't know what it's
called and it was limited edition and I
bought it in the set I'm so sad because
I moved okay so for highlight I'm
actually really skeptical about this I
have a feeling I'm not going to like
this at all this is their strobing
palette now I like the idea of it I love
the packaging but when i swatched these
they just seem way too sheer not very
pigmented there's a little bit of
glitter in them so I'm going to mix
these two up at the top it seems more
like light bulb and this one's more
pinky actually they're not bad
I still don't love it just because I
feel like it's not as smooth but I
thought it wasn't going to be pigmented
at all so so forth then it shows up this
is really nice
I don't know I think it kind of looks a
little chunky just a little bit I don't
know if it's the glitter or the fact
that it's not extremely pigmented so I
do have to apply a lot more and then
that just makes it look a little chunky
I don't think it's something you're
going to be able to tell on camera but
in person it just it it emphasizes my
texture a little bit too much so I would
say powder concert jazz love powder
highlight no no love okay so I'm going
to zoom you in a little bit more and we
are going to just do the eyes okay so I
already have a base for my eye shadow
and I picked up two eyeshadow palettes I
actually really really love this
packaging it reminds me of like Mac when
they come out with these like limited
editions such that have like the smaller
eyeshadows so I picked up this
in the shade master essentials it has a
lot of neutrals but then it has like
pops of color and then I got this one in
bear at all which is just like
jam-packed with neutrals on a fluffy
crease brush this is the Sigma e-40 I'm
going to take this shade right here and
I'm going to buff that into the crease
as you guys know with these first
impressions I don't like to do like
something crazy on the eyes I'm just
trying to test out pigmentation so this
is not like a full-blown tutorial or
anything these do have some kick up by
the way like as I'm putting my brush
into this eye shadow but that doesn't
bother me and it's not too bad now I'm
going to take a combo of these two
shades one a shimmery and one is matte
and I'm going to use that to highlight
my brow bone hmm I like this so I'm
going to take this really pretty golden
pinky shimmer right here I'm going to
take this on my entire lid this is from
the master essentials palette and we'll
see how this goes not the most pigmented
I was feeling the mats are much better
but nothing a little 6 + small 6 I'm
actually going to take a little bit of
this reddish shade right here and I'm
going to slice them up to my outer
corners this is a shimmery eyeshadow and
it's probably better if you pack it on
the lid versus what I'm doing come on in
see repayment and like it I didn't think
is gonna be so pigmented like this not
because it's drugstore it's just because
the other shimmer shade wasn't the best
now I'm going to go in ways
if that's not the loudest or play this
shade right here from the bear at all
it's like a deep chocolate color but
this one also has a little bit of
shimmer in it and I'm just going to
deepen out the outer corners then I'm
actually going to take this dark dark
brown right here and I'm going to use
this as like an eyeliner really close to
my lashes I'm sure you guys see me do
this very often I just love doing this I
feel like it adds a lot of depth to the
look I really want to recreate India's
look from the MTV movie and TV Awards
and I have a feeling everyone's going to
do that I feel it like everyone is going
to recreate that ellipse because
honestly to me it was the most stunning
look of the night and they had looked
perfect flawless her dress her makeup
her hair oh my god she looked perfect
literally perfect and I would love to do
like a full face of makeup inspired by
her makeup I don't say anything
everybody's got blue that and then mine
is going to be stupid
anyway I'm going to take this shade
right here which is darker than the one
we just used it's a lot more black and
I'm just going to stamp that right at
the outer corners but I'm not going to
bring this color in because I want the
darkness to stay right here at the end
okay now I'm gonna go back into this one
and very gently I'm just going to blend
that in here on the outer corners just
ever so slightly I'm going to go back
into the first shade we used in the
crease one last time with that same
fluffy brush and I'm just going to blend
out the harsh lines okay so I want to
add just a little bit more of that red
we used just like this much just like
those much just add a little bit of
something there for my lower lash line
I'm just going to take these two colors
the first shade we used in the crease
and then this darker Brown and I'm just
going to smudge them underneath I'm
going to start with the dark brown
and now I'm going to take the crease
shade we used and just buff that out
okay so that completes the eyes before I
give you my thoughts let me go ahead and
pop on some mascara this is the volume
and length mascara so supposedly going
to be both zero clumps add length and
volume and it is smudge proof we shall
eat ooh I think I like the wand already
I don't like Long's that are too fat
because I feel like they get all over my
lid so I'll probably fast forward this
part but I'm just going to do two coats
on each eye and on my lower lashes
okay so I totally stamped some mascara
right there but we'll just pretend it's
a beauty mark I forgot some back here
I'm a disaster I have to say I am
extremely impressed with the eye
products I tried out
I think these palettes are awesome they
swatched kind of like matte but on the
eyes I think it created a really
beautiful look they blended really
nicely I really really really really
like these palettes they totally
impressed me and this mascara I think
I'm in love with this mascara I mean I
think it gave me both links and volume
considering this is under $8 I think
it's pretty freakin fantastic to finish
off the look let's go in with a lip
color I purchased four of their liquid
matte powder lippies it just says lip
powders and yeah their liquid lipsticks
I'm assuming I got three like really
neutral shades and then like a vibrant
one and I'm actually going to go in with
this one because I think it would tie in
really nicely with the red eyeshadow
this is in the shade star status
it's a little bit patchy I think once
you get enough on your lips it looks
like okay so that is the lip color I'm
going to give it a couple of seconds or
like a minute or two to let it dry and
then I will be right back okay so my
lips are officially set they have dried
it took about a minute to dry down and
it's still like pretty sticky feels
tacky and up is my key and I don't know
how I feel about the lip I've only tried
out one color so I cannot give you like
my full thoughts the color is beautiful
as I'm looking in the mirror I really
really like the color but it did take
some building and it is tacky oh and it
keeps getting all on three days not good
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope you liked my socks I hope that if
you were interested in Cokie
professionals makeup or if you had seen
it at Walmart if you are interested I
hope this video helped you in some way I
think I really like this brand and I
can't wait to see what else they come
out with because I love trying out new
makeup I've never tried out before so
yeah you want me to do that more often
let me know I actually purchased a ton
of makeup from this brand called pretty
vulgar strangest name but the packaging
is to die for the packaging is beautiful
and I bought all of it on Sephora's
website it's like a new brand to Sephora
if you want to see kind of like the same
video you just saw now only with pretty
vulgar cosmetics let me know but yeah
that completes this video I hope you
guys enjoyed thank you so much for
