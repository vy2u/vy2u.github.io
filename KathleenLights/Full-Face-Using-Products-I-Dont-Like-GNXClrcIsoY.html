a full face of makeup using products I
don't really like I've been seeing this
video everywhere recently I've seen so
many people do it so I'm not exactly
sure who started this tag or anything
like that if you guys know who is the
first person to create this kind of
video let me know in the comments and
then I'll link their video below because
I really have no idea I tried to search
but I'm not sure who started this but
I've seen so many youtubers do it I
thought I would give it a try myself it
was a little bit hard for me because I
always keep products that I don't really
like and a little bit in my bathroom and
then every month I do my disappointing
products video and then once I'm done
doing that video I always give away the
products because there's always somebody
out there that might like it so I didn't
really have a ton of products to do like
a whole face of makeup so I have to
repurchase a couple of things and I know
you're thinking well you pre-purchase
makeup you didn't like and yeah I did so
I guess this video only a couple things
though but you know it's it's for the
tube and there are kind of other makeup
products I don't love like these are not
just the only ones I don't like there
are a ton i don't like but today we're
going to be using these I know some of
these might be your absolute favorites
so please don't get offended that my
skin might be different from yours okay
so let's get started
if you hear noises outside by the way
there is a lot of construction going on
in my house right now so if you hear
drills and hammers and all that I'm
sorry
the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
going to prime my skin and I'm going to
use the benefit professional I bought
the little mini version because I took
this I just can't get on board with this
like everybody else can I think I used
to like it like when I first started my
channel but that's because I didn't
really know much about primers
I know people rave about this and it
helps fill in pores this is my skin is
so dry I prefer the kind of primer that
really hydrates the skin so that makeup
can apply a nice and smooth on top and
not so cakey see dr. Brandt pores no
more is a great pore filling primer if I
want to set in my pores
that's always the primer I go for this
one just does absolutely nothing for me
honestly I don't hate it but I don't I
don't really like it at all okay so for
foundation I'm going to be using the
NARS all day luminous weightless
foundation another
products that had to repurchase I don't
even know if this is my color I got this
shade Fiji but I'm pretty sure Fiji is
like way too yellow for my skin tone I
purchased this years ago when it first
came out because when you think luminous
and weightless like you think that oh my
gosh I'm getting perfect for dry skin
but I remember absolutely hating this
foundation it just looks so dry to not
like it at all so I haven't worn this in
like two years
I feel like there's a ton of foundations
I really really don't like I don't know
why I went with this one since I haven't
worn it in so long I'm a little rocky
these days alright trying to make a
comeback on the YouTube even though this
video is pre-recorded but I just
remember really disliking this so I
decided to pick it up again and use it
today
it's definitely darker than my than the
rest of my body but I mean I don't I
don't hate this as much as I did before
what happened
I mean don't get me wrong I really don't
like how this worst about the day I
remember I mean I wanted to Mississippi
so it was a while ago but I remember it
wore so ugly on my skin it faded in the
weirdest way it kind of started to like
break up and look really really dry on
my skin and you know what I can kind of
already start seeing the buildup in
between my brows and ease of youin okay
I'm not so sure you can tell first of
all excuse my eyebrows okay I'm letting
them grow out so that I could reshape
them anyway starting to look cakey right
here between my eyebrows and you can't
really tell on camera but it looks
almost darker right here in the center
because the foundation is starting to
like collect there I don't know but it
does not look as bad as I remember it
looking and you know what I think it
might be I don't think I've ever tried
this with a beauty blender I think that
when I first purchased this foundation
in Mississippi like I wasn't into the
big Beauty Blender trend yet obviously
applying your foundation with a damp
Beauty Blender kind of sheers it out and
makes it a little bit more hydrating so
I guess it was kind of pointless for
this video but it's definitely not a
foundation I'm going to run to it's
definitely not one I would reach for
right away because I know I just only
call it this on my skin I don't know
alright now I'm going to go in with some
concealer I'm going to use the Becca
aqua luminous perfecting concealer I
love the
yeah Becca aqua luminous foundation this
concealer not so much feel like it
doesn't have enough coverage for me
there's something about it it's just not
for me this might be the perfect
concealer for like a no makeup makeup
look I'm someone who rather go sheer on
the foundation but have more coverage
for concealer that's why I love the
shape tape the NARS concealers are
awesome it's not bad it just doesn't do
enough and I have so many concealers I
like way more than that you smell tea no
it's not enough I'm actually going to
apply a little bit more just add some
more coverage okay so now I'm going to
set my under eye concealer with a loose
powder and then I'm going to set my face
with a pressed powder I'm actually going
to be taking the Kodi airspun loose face
powder I think I'm the only person on
the planet that doesn't like this powder
does another product that had to
purchase I just I really didn't liked it
I can't I cannot get over the scent I
was trying to sound like a year and a
half ago and every time I used it I just
could not get over how bad it smelled
and it was just linger on my skin and I
mean it sets your foundation really
beautifully it gives you a really nice
finish but the scent is so strong for me
and I have a feeling that this was
breaking me out when I was using it
because I was getting like these really
weird bumps here around my nose I don't
know if the fragrance in this powder was
kind of giving me like a weird
irritation but I guess but I know a lot
of people with oily skin really really
really really love this powder I mean
like it looks so pretty underneath my
eyes it set the concealer so nicely but
pretty sure this is irritating musk and
I'm definitely gonna give this to my
friend Melissa though because she would
love this powder like love it and she
has oily skin that's going to be if
you're watching this Melissa that's
coming your way you might really like
this so personally for my sensitive
really dry skin it did not ma-maybe okay
so to set the rest of my entire face
this is actually a newer product to me
this is from the brand the balm and I
love the balm they make amazing products
but I really just did not like this and
it's all free which is awesome by the
way this is a powder foundation and I
have used
on its own as a powder foundation or on
top of foundation as a setting powder
and both ways I don't like them I don't
think this gives you much coverage at
all to be a powder foundation it's like
very very sheer coverage and to set the
foundation it just looks so dry on me I
don't know what it is about it but I
don't like how dry this looks and I have
mine in the shade lighter than light so
I'm just going to set my skin with this
I think maybe if you have a really skin
you might really like this because it's
not like a luminous powder at all and
more I'm wearing this foundation the
more I don't like it it's like really
looking so weird right here and you
can't tell on camera but okay so I'm not
now apply too much because I'm already
looking pretty powdery just collecting
right here in my little nose area oh
crap oh look I wanted to use a liquid
bronzer and now that's just going to
look terrible on top of the powder what
was I thinking I can still smell the
Cody airspun powder by the way like I
guess because it's underneath my eye is
it sick right here next to my nose I
just can't stop smelling it and did I've
mu banana I'm going to try to make this
work honestly if it looks cakey or
growth and has nothing to do with this
product it has to do with the fact that
I put it on top of powder but this is a
liquid bronzer and this is by benefit
and it's called Dew the hoola and the
only reason I don't like this is because
it is orange I don't hate the formula or
anything it's just a really warm bronzer
and I am NOT a fan in my opinion it's
not as good as other liquid bronzers on
the market the cover effects one is my
absolute favorite but that one is pretty
pricey bareMinerals has one that's
really really nice it's like a serum
bronzer at that one it's awesome this is
just like the weirdest color
and honestly I'm just personally someone
who doesn't love warm bronzer like I
know a lot of people like Mac give me
Sun my skin tone it looks Orange like
straight-up orange but it does look
really pretty on like tan skin because
when desi where's that bronzer Disney
Perkins
it looks so pretty on your skin I would
totally use that today if I had it but I
don't have it it looks extremely patchy
but that's probably because I put powder
underneath okay so I'm going to set down
that bronzer with a powder bronzer that
I don't love this is the Marc Jacobs
Omega bronzer in the shade tantrics not
to be confused with their brand new one
that's around for summer called
fantastic because that bronzer is my
newest obsession the original one I
don't love that much it probably gets
why there's nothing wrong with this
bronzer in terms of formula it blends
really nicely I love it I just don't
love the color I think it's a little bit
too warm for my skin I don't like how it
looks every time I wear it I'm like I
wish I would've worn a different bronzer
and for as expensive as this is I
shouldn't feel that way but I keep it
because I mean I don't know why I keep
it honestly but I'm just going to blend
some of that onto my skin to warm it up
warm it up literally Cup is very warm
obviously this is looking extra crazy
because I shouldn't have put on the
Google who loved this video the mess I'm
just going to blend some of that on my
neck so that everything kind of matches
when I'm self-tanning this bronzer is
not bad like I said if you're a little
bit deeper than me you might really like
this but for someone with my skin tone
or even more fair this is just it's too
orange okay for blush I'm going to take
another highly raised about products I
mean people love this blush and it is
the NARS orgasm blush I just have it in
this like limited edition packaging I
got it for PR and they sent out like
really big versions of orgasm that's why
it looks larger I don't like how there's
glitter in it I do like a blush with a
little bit of a sheen I love to look
glowy just this has like actual glitter
in it some Tooley cheeks I also think
this blush might be a little bit too
pink for me or at least a little bit too
pigmented I didn't really apply that
much and I feel like there's a lot of
blush on laughing I didn't mean to do
that
it looks pretty
from far like when I move my face you
can see that it's a pink with a little
bit of a golden sheen but when you look
up close to my skin you see all the gold
glitter just like on my face and you
guys know how it great about Gator I
don't like it on my sheet I'm sure a lot
of you guys love it but I don't like the
texture okay so now I'm going to go
ahead and add my highlights and the
highlight I will be using is this one by
Tarte this is the Amazonian clay
highlighter in the shade sparkler not to
be confused with the I cannot stop
smelling the Cote airspun powder it's
like in my nose how is it just me
because I can't stop smelling it anyways
this is not the exposed highlighter by
Tarte that I love that highlight is
beautiful this one in sparkler is a
little too sparkly for me like I'm going
to zoom you guys in here in a second
when I'm done highlighting not only do I
feel like it's too glittery and too
chunky but I don't think a lot of
pigment goes on to your face
okay so let me zoom in I have like
little glitter particles all over my
cheek from the highlight and the
highlight just doesn't look even it
looks really chunky on the skin yeah
nothing ok so now that I've pretty much
completed my entire face I'm going to go
ahead and move on to the eyes okay so
for eyeshadow I'm going to be taking
this one by NYX this is the perfect
filter palette NYX came out with a ton
of different perfect filter palettes and
I like a lot of them I just don't like
this specific palette this one is called
the marine layer palette there's
something about this palette that just
doesn't sit well with me I feel like the
color selection is really weird I can't
do a full eye shadow look and be content
with this
I guess because I'd never wear colored
like this it's weird to me but I'm going
to take this shade right here I'm going
to set my primer with this i sat down to
film this video I was like oh my god I
don't have any eyeshadow I don't like I
make eyeshadow work for the most part
but this was just like no my favorite
this is the kind of palette I feel like
I have to go into other palettes and or
hate a little thing at all in order for
it to work I feel like I have to go into
other products
but I'm actually going to take this
color right here you know and have a
sheen to it and I'm just going to start
building this color into my crease kind
of use this as a transition shade I'm
also going to run that shade on my lower
lash line okay so I'm just going to keep
it simple and I'm going to take this
maroon shade and I'm just going to focus
this on the outer corner I've actually
never used this shade of the pallet so
this one might be really nice I'm going
to take that same color with that same
brush and run it on the outer corners of
my lower lash line as well
it's very penguin - Wow
okay so that's not bad the colors I
don't like are these two shades right
here's this blue I don't like I can make
this work with a little bit of six
clothes let me tell you but out of all
the palettes in my collection the
linings don't like that much is this one
so I thought I would use it in this
video because I didn't want to go out
and purchase an entire eyeshadow palette
that I didn't really like what I have
this one that I'm probably going to give
away because I don't really like okay so
now I'm going to add some liquid
eyeliner this is the Urban Decay
razorsharp long-wear liquid liner I
don't like these at all these are so
watery feel like you really have to add
a few layers for it to look as pigmented
and you would like it to be and I'm
taking the shade push let's try a second
layer
okay see how much nicer it looks on the
second layer even then Seoul lottery
when you work on little sections and dip
your brush in like every two seconds you
could totally make this work maybe let
me try to do a third day or right here
because it looks a little passable no it
will fix it so definitely not a Matt
eyeliner by the way if you like Matt
like I do you won't like this now that
we've done that delicious shiny sheer
wing I'm going to go ahead and apply
some mascara so I'm going to be using
this guy this is the Giorgio Armani eyes
to kill mascara this is like super
highly raised about everybody loves the
end it gives me good volume I like how
it looks on my lashes but by the end of
the night I don't know what it is about
me and this but it smudges all over the
place every time I wear this I have
black eyeliner all over the bottom by
the end of the night and nobody wants
that so I really have only used this
twice because I judge I just can't and
for that reason I would not personally
recommend it but I know a lot of people
rave about it so I'm assuming a lot of
it doesn't happen to a lot of people so
yeah I'm going to do this I'm going to
put on some mascara on my top and bottom
lashes and I will be right back alright
so we are officially almost done with
this blue and gray makeup look I'm going
to go in with my lip color and actually
I don't like this lip color because
about the chunky weird glitter this is
another product from Giorgio Armani I
was either going to use this or the
Urban Decay vice liquid lipstick like
the glittery ones those are terrible I
personally don't like them at all
they're patchy and they're weird so I
would skip those for sure but I also
really don't like this this like I said
this is the georgia armani ecstasy
lacquer in the shade tool - now the rest
of the ecstasy lacquers might be really
nice but this one in the shade 202
doesn't work for me because of this like
glitter goopy mess I just I don't I
don't like this and the texture of this
is so bizarre like it feels goopy even
look goopy it feels good beyond the lips
and like that there's this weird layer
on top of your mouth and yeah it's a
pretty color I guess but like do you see
much happening there all you really see
is like this glittery sheen and this is
not flattering throughout the day first
time I wore this I wore it on top of a
nude lip liner and it faded in the
weirdest way like there was a lot of
glitter builds up in the middle of my
mouth here I also really hate the taste
of this like I'm not eating it but I can
taste it it has a really strong chemical
taste and it doesn't smell bad at all it
has a pleasant scent but the taste is
gross and I do not like how this feels
sitting on my lips I don't I don't like
this maybe the other ecstasy lacquers
are good but okay guys so that completes
this video this was my full face of
makeup using products I don't really
like I'm sure I could have used other
products that I hated even more but I
really couldn't think of any and I got
rid of so many I felt silly purchasing
like a bunch of makeup I really hated
you know I don't know so yeah I don't
really love any of the products on my
face I don't use them at all there are a
ton of other products in my collection I
like way way more share guys that
completes this video I hope you enjoyed
it thank you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in the next video bye all
day luminous with image hopefully
there's another prop there's another a
cooler version of this doula hoola I do
