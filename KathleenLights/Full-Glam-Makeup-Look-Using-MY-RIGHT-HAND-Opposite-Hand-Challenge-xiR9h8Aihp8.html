interesting I'm going to be doing a full
face of makeup using my right hand I
know some of you don't know this because
it's not something a lot of people pick
up on my videos but I'm actually a lefty
I do everything with my left hand my
right hand is literally useless I can't
do anything with it today I'm doing the
opposite hand makeup challenge where you
do your full face of makeup using your
opposite hand and I'm doing the whole
shebang like all like all of it my
eyebrows even I'm even doing winged
liner and falsies which I don't even do
that regularly to begin with so imagine
so let's see how this is going to go
because I really cannot do anything with
my right hand
it feels so awkward for me but let's go
ahead and get started on this makeup
tutorial so I'm going to start off with
my benefit precisely my brow pencil and
if you hear construction going on
there's a lot of I know I keep saying
that and like all of my videos but we
are currently doing a lot of
construction in the backyard so BA
signor the noises and since I just did a
brow routine I'm just going to quickly
skim through this I'm just going to
start let me see help let me let me okay
amazing I hope you like this and if I do
this so I'm sure you will do it like it
is
I feel like I'm putting more pressure
down
he's a Neiman Oliver I feel like I'm
putting more pressure down with this
hand Kosilek it's so hard for me to put
my pressure to do Scooby's MINIX insider
and looking pretty good okay so I'm
going to go ahead and leave it like that
I mean there are some like harsh little
brushstrokes in there but we're gonna
move on oh my god this eyebrow is even
harder
that doesn't look that bad could be all
ready in no time
they even look semi-related well okay so
now I'm going to take my Javon shame mr.
brow brow and I am going to just set
them down lets them up a little bit make
them federer
you pry my skin I'm going to be mixing
two primers together this is the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
in radiance with tyler onic acid this is
brand-new this was just sent to me
and I am going to mix this in a little
bit with the first day Beauty coconut
skin smoothie priming moisturizer and
I'm going to mix them both because even
though I've never used this before my
face when I swatch it on the back of my
hand
it looks like it's a radiant primer but
there's not much moisture to it so this
one can give me the hydration I'm
looking for I know a successive that
seems like a lot of steps but I'm just
going to do that a little bit as a darn
it put on this hand I'm going to mix it
with him does that matter so I'm just
mixing it I guess I guess I those matter
right it's going to blend that into my
skin now I will be using a foundation
I've never tried before and I'm actually
really excited to try it this is a
pricey little fella your skin forever
perfect makeup everlasting wear pore
refining effect with sunscreen it says
it has SPF 30 and it also is supposed to
control your shine I don't really get
shiny at all the only reason I purchased
the foundation is because of Jaclyn hill
she talks about this foundation all the
time she says it's her absolute favorite
but it makes her skin look the nicest so
I caved and I bought it but I got the
shade 21 hang on and it's too yellow for
me like I'm going to show you it's like
you can't tell there but it's like very
kind of too deep and too yellow so I'm
going to take my la girl pro coverage HD
foundation in the shade white and I'm
just going to add a little bit of this
just a tiny bit to lighten up the color
and I'm just going to apply that to my
face I know I'm doing this with my left
hand
okay I did the same thing and I poured
it on the freakin right hand so silly
but I blend it in now with my right hand
Foundation has a very strange scent it
smells very perfumey almost to perfume
me I'm a little bit nervous about that I
hope it does not break me out yes
pound slips into the skin this is my
equal tools a bunch I don't know the
specific name of it oh my gosh this is
foundation is the foundation is my
sponge just put that up my nostril gosh
this has a very strong scent I'm
blending the foundation out for like 10
seconds it hasn't even been that long
and my arm hurts
do you like because I don't lift this
arm much it's just not as strong by the
way in case you were wondering this
isn't a first impressions kind of video
or anything like that but since we're
already here I think I should have added
another drop of that white foundation
but the finish of this foundation is
actually really nice it does not feel
tacky my pores are actually looking
extremely visible at the moment and I
think that I have to do with the
Smashbox primer I put first for
concealer I'm going to be using the
Milani retouching erase like lifting
concealer I have been loving this
recently I don't know why I can't stop
using it I'm going to shade 0-2 light
and I'm going to squeeze a little bit
onto the foam lightly and just throw up
some of this well I mean you know how I
put on concealer sometimes I feel the
need to explain every little step' when
I forget you can see you can see this
thing I'm going to take some of this
onto my eyelid because I'm just going to
use this to prime my eyes I really
really really love this concealer a lot
but I do not like this sponge applicator
thing I'm going to take this little tart
unicorn brush and I'm just going to
blend that in just concealer kind of
dries fast oh just my eye and I'm just
blending that in I feel like I'm being
really rough let me try to relax this
hand like just puts more pressure on my
face I don't know why
and like it hurt why does my hand hurt I
mean I work out three times a week I do
arms I mean I have been slacking on the
gym not going to I haven't done arms in
a couple weeks I'm going to take some of
this concealer I'm going to put some on
my nose and between my eyebrows just to
highlight the rest of my face since the
foundation with a little dark okay so to
set that concealer down I'm going to be
using a powder I've never tried before
this is like half a first impression
this is the Kat Von D locket blotting
powder in the shade light and I'm not
sure if this is meant to just set your
face I don't know if you can use this to
sit underneath your eyes I don't know if
it's too heavy but we're going to try
doing both when I swatch this this feels
so soft and it feels like slightly
creamy but very finely milled I don't
know I really like the texture on my
finger oh my gosh just did a really good
job of like blurring my pores right here
it didn't feel or look like a sick
powder at all which I'm not going to lie
I was a little bit concerned about
because a lot of Kat Von D's locket
products are made for like oily skin
alright now for some bronzer this is the
NARS Sun wash diffusing bronzer and this
one is in the shade Laguna they have a
few different shades but of coats
my favorite is Laguna I'm just going to
use the elf pointed powder brush and
these bronzers really got a dig in there
to get some good pigmentation which I
don't mind because they are very
buildable bronzers but it never looks
better looks too much so I'm just gonna
feel so weird I'm just going to contour
and wrong like this
oh the - hi wait trying to get into the
hall over here feel so natural to me
already
is my offer
what does Avenue like pressure like
pressure like pressure that looks pretty
decent I do think I applied a lot but I
feel like I'm putting a lot of pressure
with my right hand I don't know why like
I'm like hurting my place she's gonna
bronze my neck because well you didn't
know you were here a few minutes ago you
saw what happened you know what I think
we'll take this to look up a notch and
make it look even better is is I baked
because I'm not going to lie I might
have gone overboard with the books by
the way do you like my I'm going to take
my Fiona Styles invisible finish loose
setting powder in white stone and I'm
going to bake my finis I'm going to take
that same equal tool sponge I'm going to
dip it into this like I not a big okay
it's not like this
this is easier wham-o when is higher
than the other okay I'm just gonna leave
like that
and move on to blush I'm going to take
my essence satin touch blush in the
shade satin love and it is this really
gorgeous like everyday shade this color
so beautiful and I'm going to take my
Linda Hallberg 310 brush and with a
light hand because holy crap
this bush excited I love that color and
essence is like two dollars and I'm just
gonna wipe off this big thing and now I
feel like I need a little bit more
bronze and try not to bring it past the
baked we just sit because that would
defeat the purpose a little bit more
here oh my god you know we crave here
doing your makeup with your opposite
hand and without a mirror as a double
challenge right there watch that already
be a thing going in with my highlight
I'm going to use the makeup revolution
vivid baked highlighter in the shade
radiant light
it's so crazy how it's not second nature
to us to just use like both hands why is
it that we use one hand way better than
the other why is that sure there's a
reason okay I'm gonna add a little bit
on my nose okay now we can jump into
eyes this video is already long and I
haven't even started my eyes eyes I'm
going to take this little Mac palette I
recently bought at Alta by the way Mac
is being sold at Ulta now does anybody
else feel really weird about that like
this is the dusky Rose times nine eyes
shadow palette I wanted to get it cuz it
had these really pretty pinky Brown
shades I'm going to take this a fluffy
crease brush and I'm going to dip it
into this middle shade right here and
I'm going to start buffing this color
into my crease in circular motions
I feel like I'm not getting the smooth
slow I normally do like I'm usually just
kind of out how high my crease boom BAM
done and I feel like I'm taking a little
bit longer because my hand is not
letting me like be smooth and slowly
it's like kind of stiff I let my arm
feels like it's going to fall off this
move on Sonics color I'm going to take
this shade right here and I'm going to
use that to highlight the brow bone very
high lady shade and then I'm going to go
over it with this color right here this
one has less of a sheen it's a little
bit more stati so my camera stopped
recording and I don't know when it
stopped recording so I just took this
color right here and I just applied that
to my entire lid
I'm going to go back in with that first
brush and I'm just gonna blend out the
harsh edges now I'm going to take this
bronze color right here on my zoeva 2 to
7 and I'm just going to pack that color
on the outer corners I just want to add
a little bit of depth to the outer
corners and make it look a little bit
more smoky I'm going to bring this color
into the crease a little bit might as
well set my hand just did it on a dome
so I went with it and then I'm going to
go back in with that lid shade and I'm
just going to go over it one more time
then you go back into that crease shade
we used blend some more because things
are looking a little unblended here in
the crease for my lower lash line I'm
just going to take you that first shade
we used in the crease and I'm gonna both
the feel so awkward doing these lower
lashes oh my gosh and then with a tiny
tiny little pencil brush this one's from
zueva it's a 240 I'm going to take a
really dark shade and I'm going to be
really precise with this I only want it
like right here close to the lashes as
possible I'm not going to drag it too
far in I'm going to keep it mainly on
the outer part
all right so that is everything I'm
going to do on the eyes in terms of
eyeshadow I'm going to apply some
eyeliner to my waterline i'm going to
tightline with this as well this is the
ardency in smoother eyes supercharged
eyeliner in the shade coffee oh gosh I'm
cheating I'm like holding it with my
left hand up okay I am so rough with my
right hand this face I'm making I know I
just can't help it it's like really hard
to put on eyeliner because I normally
hate to tug at my eyes and I don't want
to do that so okay so now I'm going to
apply some liquid liner this is going to
be something I'm going to use my em
cosmetics illustrative eyeliner this is
the brush tip version probably going to
speed up this part because I'm sure it's
going to take me an hour so I need to
concentrate and let's do this I messed
up already
it was going so well I totally just
messed that up down so pray to myself
for a second see if I could fix that
consist I is even harder okay so even
though that was absolutely god-awful
I thought it was going to look worse for
falsies I'm going to be applying these
from the brandt Ayler the 1 5 5 lash
think these might be a little bit longer
than my eye shape okay now I cut too
much off will work with it I'm going to
apply some House of lashes glue Oh
oh okay not bad i okay okay I'm just
gonna let that sit there and I'm going
to let it dry completely before I mess
with it so I'll be right back
so to cover up the line of these falsies
I'm just going to take the liquid liner
and cover this I'm going to apply a
little bit of mascara this is the Mac
golden Bab lash and I'm only going to
take a little bit of this just to mix my
lashes in with the falsies and then if
you take off this little red cap it has
a lower lash mascara
okay so that completes the eyes
considering I did it with my right hand
I think it came out pretty decent so to
finish off this extremely long video I
am just going to apply my lip color I'm
going to take this color pop ultra
blotted lip I haven't tried these yet
but supposedly it's like a super super
super thin liquid lipstick it's almost
like a liquid to powder feeling and it's
not supposed to be as pigmented as it
looks in the tube so it also gives you
like the blotted look only aim at
version this formula is such a strange
feeling I don't know how to explain this
feeling it feels like there's nothing on
my lips but it feels kind of like
powdery I would say it's kind of like
their liquid lipsticks but a thinner
version I don't know how to explain this
formula at all I have to play around
with all the colors and then I'll get
back to you
I want to lighten this color up a bit I
think it's a little bit too dark so I'm
going to take the outrageous plump
effects gloss in 0-2 from Sephora I love
these little glosses nothing's going to
get any lighter but is it a little okay

was my full face full glam makeup
