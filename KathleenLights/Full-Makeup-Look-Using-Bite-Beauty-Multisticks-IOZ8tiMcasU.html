really cool one I'm going to be doing my
whole face with the new bite Beauty
multi Stix I use a ton of different
shades on my entire face I used it for
my eyes my bronzer my blush and my lip
color this video is actually sponsored
by bite Beauty which is amazing I love
this brand so much and they kind of
challenged me to try and create this
full face look using the multi Stix the
really cool thing about this is actually
the formula
it applies like a cream but when you
start to blend it out it actually blends
out like a powder it doesn't really feel
like a lipstick on the skin it has 35%
powder in the bullet which makes it
really easy to work with and it makes it
easy to blend out as a lot of you know
bite beauty products are actually made
with food grade ingredients which is
pretty amazing you can use this in a few
different ways you could apply it
directly to your skin from the bullet
you can use your fingers or you can go
in with a brush it depends on your
personal preference they have 18 shades
in the line and it's basically like a
three in one product you could use it
for eyes cheeks and lips so if you want
to see how I got this look then just
keep watching so I already have my base
makeup on 1/2 foundation and concealer
and now I'm gonna jump into the eyes I'm
going to take the multi stick in the
shade creme caramel and I'm going to use
this as my transition shade it's a
really pretty nude peachy warm color I'm
going to take a fluffy crease brush and
just take some of this product directly
on the brush and I'm going to start
building this color up into my crease
these are really really pigmented but
they blend really well
now I'm going to take a smaller crease
brush and I'm going to dip it into the
shade and it's just taking a little bit
of this on this brush and I'm going to
focus this on the outer corners of my
eyes and dragging it into my crease just
a little bit
now I'm going to go back into the other
brush I used earlier and blend
everything out
I'm going to go back and repeat that
process one more time applying some of
this and then blending it out
for my lower lashline I'm going to take
the shade brioche on a small little
brush like this and I'm just going to
run that on my lower lash line this is a
really pretty warm almost reddish color
and I love how it ties in with all the
other warm colors I'm going to go back
into creme caramel and I am just going
to buff this into my crease a little bit
more
now using an angled eyeliner brush I'm
actually going to take the shade cocoa
and I'm going to use this as an eyeliner
just to give a little bit of definition
to my lash line and slowly start
painting this
and now I'm just going to apply some
mascara okay so now we're going to move
on to bronzer and blush or bronzer I'm
actually going to mix two of the multi
sticks together I'm going to take honey
leet which is a very very very warm
color and then I'm going to mix it with
a little bit of blondie which is this
color right here so it is lighter and
not as warm so I'm going to take honey
wheat and just apply this to the back of
my hand like this and then I'm going to
take blondie and do the same thing right
on top I'm going to take a little
synthetic brush bounce that in and start
applying this to my face and I'm not
pressing too hard because I want to be
able to blend the product out so you
want to use a very light hand
so for blush I want something really
warm to tie in with the eyes I'm going
to take the multi stick in the shade
praline it's almost like a terracotta
peach so so pretty this time I'm just
going to take it directly from the stick
on a fluffy synthetic brush and just
lightly apply this to my cheeks
okay so to finish off this look I'm
going to go in with my lip color I'm
going to take the multi stick in the
shade almond this is a stunning stunning
lip color and I'm actually going to
apply it directly onto my lips and then
perfect it with a brush
and since I don't want this to look too
rampy I'm going to take the shade cashew
and I'm going to apply some right on top
of almond just to lighten it up a bit
okay guys so that completes this video I

was a cool fun and challenging way to
use the new bite Beauty multi Stix but
