board should I write a little note like
what like mom flat jesse smiles or told
no just smell home yes final Stacy's
mail the biggest shower
I am so read and discussing not me
beautiful it's true
they look like crazy or should I do
something else yeah I mean you have a
bun on is that what you were going for
does it look like normally mess here and
let's say looks pretty like you drink up
together but like you're a little bit
wild okay and Nicki yeah and the mind
just looks like a banana hey guys so
today's video it's going to be a get
ready with me
but not just any get ready with me know
I get ready with me involving alcohol no
that wasn't it say there's gonna be
eight get ready with us we're gonna be
doing our makeup on camera here's the
thing we come along together as videos
we've already done so we don't really
know what we're just doing a get ready
with me but you guys you guys said you
didn't care what you saw long as they
would haul a ball that's true that's
tiny I shot it because I've already had
six that's true how do you drink that
with such ease cuz it's cold it has I
use the ice melts into the whiskey come
on be classy for one who's gonna sign it
it I've got a gun
wow that's pretty if you have any
children that you normally watch
caffeine's videos with or if you're
watching with anyone under the age of
something that is appropriate perhaps
turn this one off because this one's
probably gonna be a little little bit
you know because we're drinking right
right
you know I say I'm gonna label this get
ready with those cat chats you guys know
every time something is labeled cat
chet's you never know what you're gonna
get okay so do not watch any cat chats
with your kids none of them McCoist is
that last time we filmed I mixed vodka
and wind together and it was the worst
night of my freakin life that's not true
so we're not doing that this time
you didn't say those twists the whole
Tammy that's right so the twist is we're
actually gonna be swapping Meghan we're
gonna be doing like a big makeup swap so
I have to wear all of Jesse's makeup on
my face and she has to wear my makeup on
her face I need to get makeup on because
I do not have
low sold you need to be a good friend
and tell me what actually we're
switching even brushes so get my brushes
I brought for you and of course Kathleen
has five thousand brushes and I'm just
going to keep them here on the second
case he brought me her super clean
brought cheese I'm gonna use on my face
today really cuz I would you clean
whoever you use the same color every day
Michelle Phan said you don't have to
yeah like 2011 she said it's the same
pigment okay we need to put on makeup
and now because not that I'm insecure
anything no what about you were allele
people are something this bitch man
fucking signs everything she says just
gold by signs fat Leo's are insecure I
think you said fat Leo's are is growing
so hot here I put at 69 okay we saw the
foundations I can cover this up actually
I always do my eyes first fucking you
have to do your eyes person also i prime
with concealer this is all bad news okay
so I'm assuming you do your face first
no I saw my eyes you're like I swear why
would you ask me if I could do that I
just wanted to cover my face with a
video okay see but no it's more
efficient to start with this is your
favorite path first of all you gave me
that Oh
all of these are yours this is yours is
this stuff I'm giving you yeah you give
me these you gave me did you gave me
this no but this one's mine but I know
you like this one oh but I guess it's
really good okay so I use it for
eyeshadow palette everyday pleaser I
already get colors from all of these so
oh okay from all of these because one is
my enough guy so what I use as a primer
um okay I got special primer elixir
which I swear I use every day I'm not
trying primary lick sir
yeah okay like a mixture oh okay I use
the hangover primer first but then I use
a doctor
brass Luminizer primer you know I love
that wait you use this first now I'm
talking about I primer you told me I was
oh yes okay okay okay - my friend my
friend my primer shit everywhere
do you happen to have even urban decay I
haven't written a very emotion in enigma
well I guess you can use that one
because I use eaten that's nothing but
what a fucking fail well you have to
frame your face first before you start
your eye makeup I mean are we makeup
gurus here we makeup girls you run your
face and then do your eyes
yes why the fuck wouldn't you you have
to you have to let it sink it's your
skin are you stupid or delicious in your
skin comment below
yeah so if I'm following your routine
that I don't burn my face first
no can I explain what I did to private
this is the worst thing in the world you
guys to use this first actually love
this primer self on joke's on you know
what you want why don't you bring your
contacts that's concealer I've been like
you know when this is the milk makeup
foot sealer
well that's not it for your priming you
think I was then you told me those two
primers yeah then you got a spritz this
coverfx luminizing spray whatever the
fuck I love this yeah but it's only
really good when you put it before your
makeup I'll disagree
afters - glitters and you shake it
really well it's good wow you didn't
even check it out this is like fucking
gloopy did you take out like the stop I
hate this freaking it's hacking fail oh
this computer tell her this concealers
made for certain type of people and
you're up somebody and this is not made
for self done oh wait the stopper comes
off I know
and you know what that's my third milk
megaplex consider where the stopper
comes off so why don't you like pack cuz
I like it oh this is a little bit dark
for my preference of primer which is
fine oh you use lights and under
rise and then I supposed to sign I just
kind of feel like aren't we like similar
skin tones no you're darker than me
never heard that safety it's a mile out
I'm like very pale I don't leave my
house I'm a little bit vitamin D
deficient oh my do Emily my house
somebody look at me
okay so what do you do with your
eyeshadow do you put like a powder all
over your eyes I usually set my my
concealer yeah with what it's usually
face powder to be honest candlelit
delicious
we were the messiest person I know first
of all I fucking knew you would judge me
like that
well actual question why do you clean
your makeup if it's only you using it
it's not that I clean my you go cuz I
don't it's just you destroy your makeup
I'm sure you tap into this like like I
have a feeling I just have things can
you show the people what you think is a
lot this is what everyone's makeup looks
like hello a little messy for me in my
opinion wait I'm sorry I don't have time
to wipe my fucking eyeshadow palettes
I'm cleaning my son Apple my eyes looks
so dark to begin with this concealer so
dark I wish my face was prime so that my
partner is singing to my skin I won't
make a guru at heart just Stiles has a
YouTube channel did you find an
eyeshadow palette in here yes I did
dreams really oh this is not product
placement this has nothing to do not
sponsor No so I think I'm gonna it is a
second what is this oh oh these are my
three she doesn't she doesn't give a
crap about me so she was you know but
these are made with a lot of stuff wow
this is so pretty Kathleen Congrats I'm
gonna use this color oh okay let me see
if you know what color I'm gonna use the
color Stardust no mames weird packaging
the way that you look at it is how it is
when you look at it I mean you know I'm
gonna use the color magical in the
crease oh my god I need this brush I
need this brush makeup check makeup
shall we do another shot I'm not oh my
god Jenni did you see me pour this or
did this pour itself
have you ever bundle like this like a
professional lightning man looking about
ten emojos oh she's very sweet the thing
is I may have said this on the live
stream before I just feel like she's
very young and she's doing things but I
think maybe she might regret God and be
like oh we should have said that no but
I find her very entertaining I want to
talk about us
oh my god the top of my eyes look green
from that consumer oh no honey it looks
like I put this fucking moon whatever it
be now my fucking hole I this is a
little bit of choices I can't get over
these makeup shadow brushes they're the
best brushes I've ever time you're so

you have a mirror right here cuz you
know I have a comment to make I hope you
know in my video with you where we did
the Jenga

was that added to peace I put two Eids

fuckin more of a trainwreck than this is

tips you can be what who i what do I say

human being
