going to be a random roundup video I
know I'm sorry I was actually supposed
to film a video today so that can go up
on Friday because next week is a very
busy week for me I'm traveling or
anything like I'm home I'm back I'm
ready
but I'm here recording for just next
week because oh my nieces and nephews
all the kids are my family they're on
summer break and so we're gonna go to
the beach we're gonna go to the pool and
all that stuff but anyway I know a lot
of you guys like these random rebels
videos so we thought why not I'm
actually putting on just a little bit of
makeup right now and I'm actually gonna
be heading out the door because I'm
actually gonna get a tattoo today which
is why I'm vlogging today I've been on a
tattoo kick recently that always happens
to me I feel like I always get my
tattoos in threes we were in Vegas
celebrating Danny's birthday the entire
group got element tattoos like on their
arms I got this one because I'm an air
sign I'm an Aquarius and we are air
signs a lot of people think we're water
sign totally or not we are very much air
anyway you know what when you get a
tattoo for those of you who have gotten
this tattoo it's like when you get it
you're like I want more and it's like
you feel that way for a little bit and
every time that happens to me I'm gonna
get tattoos in threes I got the heart
the music note behind my ear and keep me
where the light is what I have written
on my foot I got them all like within a
week and then I got the element tattoo I
got the word bibliophile tattooed here
recently when I was in LA and now I need
one more I need no more to complete the
trilogy and then I'm done and it's funny
because I always say that um but I
actually feel like I'm done for real I
mean I love tattoos I have a bunch of
them but they're all very small and not
to mention my bed hates them every time
I get a relative - he's like you're
thinking okay but at least put them in
place I can't see them but I'm actually
getting a very visible one today I mean
I want to consider it very visible but
it's Bissell getting girl-power
tattooed here on the inside of my arm so
the GRL and then under a PWR and I'm
getting that tattoo with my friend
Millie and we're going with Amelia as
well but Amelia
is finishing up this like arm piece she
has I mean is getting a whole sleeve
she's one of the sleeves since we were
like in middle school it's wild but she
actually got a really cool
zowie tattoos always her daughter it's
like a compass no it's not a compass but
like a clock and it has like the time
she was born her sign which is always a
Libra shout out to all my divas out
there you give us other air signs a good
name because you're the best air sign
anyway there's a really cool tattoo on
her arm but she didn't get to finish the
Rose last time she was there so we're
all going together me and Millie are
getting girl power and then she's
finishing up the rose and it's actually
so funny because I have a bathroom rug
that says girl power I found a Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works candle like a couple months
ago that said girl power and I thought
it was so cute
and I've always loved that saying or
like that those words that phrase girl
power and last time I was in Vegas
celebrating Danny's birthday and Millie
was there and we were talking about
tattoos and then she mentioned that she
wanted to get girl power tattoo and I
was like yes I love that I love that so
we figured we would get it together I
love that I feel like women more and
more every day or just becoming bosses
and I love girl power I feel like girls
are really mean to each other
I kind of feel like we're starting to
change that I know it's a stretch but I
really do feel like we're starting to
change that I feel like every day I see
women empower each other more and lift
each other up more I don't know I'm
feeling good about women I'm finding
funny little sorry actually I went
through high school with my friend
Millie but she was in my cousin's grade
she was great above me and I never ever
spoke to her we didn't talk at all but
we hung out with the like B same group
of people's cuz I hung out with Janine's
friends cuz I had no friends I just
never really talked I always thought
that Millie hated me so I never really
spoke to her she kind of intimidated me
a little bit and I was you know me I was
a major was in school I ate lunch in a
classroom like I was a dork I'm still
aboard so I just assumed today to make
never talk to her and then one day I'm
standing in Denny's cousin's house his
cousin David it was David's mom's house
so Danny's aunt's house and she was
telling me how David was gonna bring his
new girlfriend Millie and I was like oh
yeah can we do me a great whatever and
then when she walks to her I was like
uh-huh
this movie from her who's just so funny
it felt so weird for a second but I was
like what a small world and she's gonna
take it ever since and that was like
what four years ago and she's been with
David ever since and that was like what
four years ago I know it feels like it
was forever ago so now by law we're like
technically
what I'm recording a luna vlog you
didn't notice this camera see me yeah
anyway that's what I'm doing today just
adding a little bit of makeup on putting
on some mascara and going out the door
just gonna finish up the rest of my
makeup and I'll see you in a little bit
okay actually so I'm having breakfast
right now I'm waiting for Amelia to get
here because she's gonna pick me up
she's driving to this event today any
way I can get out of driving I will 100%
but I'm actually having some grits
I started this like vegan meal prep it's
like a local place in Miami that does it
and I'm not vegan
I still eat seafood all the time I'm not
all the time but I still eat crab I
still eat fish and stuff so I am NOT me
again but because of my health and so
many stomach issues I've been having
I've pretty much had to lead a pretty
plant-based diet
I avoid red meat I avoid dairy
completely I cannot have not even a
little bit of dairy I will throw up
everywhere and like I've told you guys
I'm still on the hunt for the cause of
all this but anyway starting the Sigma V
good meal prep that Gabi recommended to
me I mean this is the first time I'm
trying it this is breakfast these are
the grits and it has like vegan sausages
it's really good
I love grits so and this is like
Hispanic grits it's yellow anyway I'll
try this place out see how it goes
I'll let you know more about it if it's
any good or anything but Horton does
this all day all day we've had
construction going on in this house for
a super long time but Danny is the one
like doing it himself so he's like
building out there so he has to go build
all the I'm having a girls day not
really because after that I have to go
get my Invisalign trays
switched out so I'm gonna be in a very
bad mood at the end of
day no I'm not positive mind positive
mind it's not gonna be so bad it's gonna
be fine everybody I have to take off my
nail polish look at this I look like a
little crusty girl I hate this uh I
gotta take my nail polish off before I
book okay well you guys are distracting
me I gotta go down
okay I mean this just got her baby
Hiro is so cute I love it I love it very
beautiful very beautiful we show
everybody the Zoey detail over here I
love this I love the Libra things looks
so cute Millie's over here getting her
girl power where you decided to get them
in red
yeah I love this time I felt like the
other front was too like boring girl
power that's like oh this is girl power
you know okay Millie just finish that
took a whole three seconds can you tell
me can you give me a little oh so cute I
love it love it
nice nice now I'm next I'm next
oh yeah that's what it was just gonna
take off
okay this is the final outcome it's okay
it looks black right now because you
know we just did it that's the stencil
that they all night hey guys so I I mean
I mean his cart right now we're parked
at diced I get like a Mexican wool it's
really really good I mean who doesn't
have tint in this car and it always
makes me so uncomfortable like are
looking at me hold my camera take my
seat belt off or parked psycho guys -
I'm obsessed with it I absolutely love
how it came out but I love the font I
love what it means I love that I can
look at it while he's in the car enix
off I just love what it means I love
what it represents and I love that I got
it with Millie because I feel like
Millie is all about women empowerment
she's always lifting other girls and I
love it and I feel like us girls need to
be more like that because we're too mean
to each other and I don't know why I
love this tattoo that's my little
reminder of we are unstoppable women are
amazing anyway I'm here I mean it went
inside to get the food I didn't want to
go inside because there was a lot of
people and like people make me really
really nervous um I have to work out a
couple things I know I know but anyway
I'm making a media sit in the car with
me and eat lunch but she does it for me
because she's my best friend and she
accepts me for who I am I'm gonna go
home now and then I have to go to get my
Invisalign switched out yay hey guys
it's actually been two days since that
last clip you just saw I accidentally
left my camera and Amelia's car when she
dropped me off I just quickly wanted to
wrap up this video here I wanted to kind
of sign out but show you guys I actually
went today I know wherever much I'm
worth today to a tattoo removal place
because I have been wanting to get the
tattoo on my wrist removed for about
eight years now I kinda wanted to remove
it the second I got it it was my second
tattoo I ever got the first one was the
star on my foot
if you guys have seen my tattoo video I
made it years ago
like literally years ago but I talk
about the key I had on my boy I still
have it on my wrist I think I was the
first person that guy had ever tattooed
because he really had no idea what he
was doing and he told me he was brand
new to the shop and I really I think I
was like his first person he tattooed
honestly it ended up being so much
thicker like so much thicker than the
stencil he put down it was a hot mess so
from the moment I got it I never ever
liked it and I had been wanting to
remove it for years and I finally got
the courage to do it I'm removing the
one on my wrist and I'm removing the one
on my foot would you've you gotta
remember on the side of my foot I have
keep me where the light is which was my
favorite tattoo ever the moment I got it
I did like it but the guy who tattooed
me he made the lines so thick and he did
it so deep and you couldn't even read it
anymore every time somebody would come
be like what is this and your foot I was
just like because nobody could read it
unless you knew what it said people
always ask me what it said so you're
gonna see my wrist looking really crusty
for a really long time because it
doesn't get fully removed until about
ten sessions you said it might be like
nine or ten sessions myself so many
before and after pictures of people's
skin looking absolutely perfect like you
couldn't even tell there was a tattoo on
it so I'm very very excited I know it's
gonna look really ugly for a really long
time because you have to wait like two
whole months between each session
because your skin has to completely heal
before doing it again
but when I tell you that like this one
wasn't so bad they applied like a really
really cold air like they froze my skin
there and they do that first so that
they can numb it make it really really
cold and numb which it does kind of make
your skin really numb but the cold air
even the cold air hurt me like the cold
air was painful but whatever they she
did the laser on my wrist and I you know
it was painful I held it but it wasn't
so bad it was over like in five seconds
but when she did the one on my foot oh
my god I literally saw stars
I saw sorry I was like gripping and
holding on for dear life I was like
screaming internally my body was shaking
like every time she did a word she just
stopped and let me breathe for a second
I was like okay go but it was it was ten
times more painful than yet
the tattoo and getting the tattoo was
really really painful so I'm a little
bit a little bit bummed to have to do
this 9 more times
but I'm excited haven't liked this
tattoo in years so it's just gonna be so
crazy not seeing it but I love tattoos
and I never thought I would ever remove
them it's just I didn't go to a really
good tattoo artist listen if you are
going to invest enhance a to invest in a
really good makeup art made worse tattoo
artists because that's how it was on
your body for the rest of your life so
save up save as much as you can even if
the person is a little bit more
expensive because it is worth it because
then you're gonna end up like me and
having to remove the tattoo and it is
extremely painful but yeah you guys will
see it slowly but surely start to
disappear it's gonna take a while but
you'll see it hey guys thanks for coming
along with me in this blog thanks for
watching me get a tattoo and go through
the process of removing it I wanted to
film it while I was there but I was
nervous to ask up anyway guys I'm gonna
talk to you guys later I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
