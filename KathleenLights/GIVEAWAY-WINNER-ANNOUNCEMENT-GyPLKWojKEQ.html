growling and barking my my dogs are
fighting over a ball but anyway today is
the day where I announce the winner to
might giveaway I just want to touch base
on a couple of things before I announce
the winner one I'm in a new location I
am in the living room of the house
because um well let's see I filmed the
TMI tag yesterday I think that video
should go up either tomorrow or in a
couple of days and in the bloopers part
of that video you hear that my closet
completely collapsed so clothes went
absolutely everywhere and my whole room
is kind of like flooded and closed let
me just get through this video without
any that would be great children please
so I wasn't able to fix it till late
last night and I still haven't put any
of the clothes up or any of my shoes
back so my room is a hot mess so I had
to film this video out here because
today is the day that I said I was gonna
post the giveaway winner the giveaway
winner was chosen completely at random
it wasn't that somebody was better or
somebody said something nicer knows it's
really chosen at random and
unfortunately there is only one winner
if I can give all of you guys this
giveaway I would it really does break my
heart that I have to sit here and say
that one person won because so many of
you guys entered and it's just real it's
it makes me sad it like really giveaway
make me really really sad I don't know I
hate having to do this but don't worry
there'll be more giveaways in the future
and more chances for you to win I want
to do like cute little giveaways on
Twitter sometimes on my Instagram so
don't forget to follow me on those
platforms oh yeah okay you guys are like
shut up who won okay

was super super random it just happened
that way and congratulations on winning
this giveaway please make sure because
I'm not I don't know how old you are but
please make sure that if you are under
18 years old you have your parent's
permission because I don't want the
bucks to get to your house and your
parents are like what is who is this
what is happening so make sure that if
you are under 18 you have your parents
permission also you should have already
received a message from me saying that
you won
and me asking for your shipping
information and all that stuff that's
why I get your parents permission I
don't want to give approval and thank
you to everyone who participated in this
giveaway like I said if I could give
this giveaway to each and every one of
you I would make you so sad and also I'm
sorry for all of you guys who got
scammed into thinking that you won the
giveaway there has been so many scams
going on with ever with a bunch of
different youtubers giveaways like this
has been happening a lot lately and I
don't understand why somebody would take
time out of their day create a fake
account that's similar to mine or
anybody else's and then tell people that
they want to giveaway that's just cool
that's pretty freaking evil if you ask
me
so I'm so so so sorry if you guys got
scammed in any way I apologize and yeah
