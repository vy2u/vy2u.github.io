a first impressions are really weird
first impressions so I recently by the
way that's water
well that's Perrier I just spilled
someone my shirt five seconds ago so I
recently got this product in the mail it
was sent to me for PR I wasn't planning
on doing a video on this but I just had
so many thoughts on this product that I
was like I did I just I want to try it
out for the first time on camera this is
the new Too Faced glow job that's right
glow job radiance boosting glitter face
mask I don't know what's up with the
world these days I feel like you're
gonna see glitter face masks coming in
from so many different brands now
because I believe the first people who
did it don't quote me the first people I
saw create a glitter face mask was glam
glow they came out with that black
glitter mask and there was a ton of
videos on it and it did look really cool
I'm not gonna lie I was pretty intrigued
by it but it looked painful
like for some reason the thought of
putting a face mask that had a bunch of
glitter on my face sounded so painful
like if the little sharp edges of the
glitter we're going to cut my face
that's just how I felt like I was gonna
have little tiny scratches all over my
face when I took off the mask and
honestly I was like what can they come
up with now like glitter in your face
mask honestly I get it I know that
that's mainly for fun and for looks and
for a uniqueness for something different
because we really haven't seen something
like that before so I understand brands
wanting to do something out of the box
but honestly if I'm buying a face mask
I'm buying it for its skin care benefits
for what its gonna do to my skin glitter
it's not an ingredient I typically look
for I gotta say so when I got this in
the mail I was like you know what I'm
gonna freaking try it I'm gonna try it
on camera let's see if this does give me
a nice glow and this one is actually
really cool it does look completely
different from the glam glow one this
one is pink like I'm not gonna lie it
looks pretty freakin cool I'm gonna zoom
you in but it's like this clear pink
consistency and it has like a trillion
little glitters all throughout it and it
does look very pretty when I was opening
this package yesterday my friends were
at my house Melissa and Stephanie were
here and the three of us agreed this has
scent that reminds me of my childhood I
don't know what it is and I know I say
it all the time like everything reminds
me of my childhood but for real
what does oh my gosh wait is it coming
to me maybe this either smells like an
old school lip gloss like an old school
hair gel it smells like something we
used to use back in the day it really
does but anyway nobody cares about that
I just wanted to let you know so it
looks really cool the consistency
reminds me of slime like it looks like
slime it says give yourself a glow job
with this revolutionary radiance
boosting peel-off
glitter masks infused with real gold
there is real gold in this product
that's crazy
our illuminating and smoothing mask is
supercharged with brightening
ingredients for a healthy luminous glow
dull skin is removed to reveal a fresh
complexion and skin is left feeling
smoother softer and makeup ready so I'm
always in the mood to try out a new
radiance mask or like a glow boosting
mask because you know I have dry skin
and I love any type of mask that's
really gonna make my skin glow some of
them are a little gimmicky and I feel
like they don't really work but we're
really gonna give this one a nice little
test it does say on the two-faced
website that the exfoliating formula
lifts away dull tired skin and I wonder
if the exfoliating formula is the
glitter particles I I don't think so
and on the website it just says coming
soon but I went on the two-faced
Instagram and they said that they were
going to restock January 8th which is
what I'm planning on posting this video
so it might be back in stock by the time
you're watching this I don't know if
it's worth it we shall see but just
letting you know in case you were
wondering and before I get started I
just want to mention that they really
need to name this glow job I mean all
you have to do is change the G to a B
and it's a very sexual night okay I
don't know what's up with these makeup
companies giving everything sexual names
it's just a little weird to me like if I
was a parent and my teenage daughter was
like oh my gosh mom can you buy me the
glow job I'd be like what and she'd be
like Gold job it's a face man
can I be like I'm seeing my heart attack
if I said something else I don't know
maybe that's just me am I the only one
that feels that way or do we like the
little sexual play on words cuz I think
some of it can be funny but like naming
a blush deep throat too far anyway that
has nothing to do with this video that
was just my two cents
let me get back on topic it says you're
supposed to have clean dry skin before
use check and you need to use a spatula
Jake to mix the masks and activate
glitter formula avoid hairline eye and
eyebrows and lips obviously allow masks
to set for 30 minutes or until it's
completely dry and then you're supposed
to peel it off like from the corners and
then wipe away any excess product so
let's do this oh okay huh this is
completely off topic but I was just like
cleaning my spatula I mean I always wash
this but I wanted to give it a nice
little like cleaning with a makeup wipe
and I oh my god this music feat this
smells like feet I just purchased this
Burt's Bees micellar cleansing
towelettes oh heavens there is no way
I'm putting that on my face there is no
way could I get a bad batch is my pact
expired okay anyway cleaned off my
scotch a little bit and it says you're
supposed to makes it to activate the
glitter formula
oh my gosh
dude what does the smell like that is
gonna drive me on but it's gonna drive
me crazy the fact that this smells like
something and I don't know what it is
am i applying too much because I feel
like I have wasted half the door already
ah ah my hair it was like something
about Mary okay so I did apply a lot of
this this is how much I have left what I
don't understand is how this is gonna
exfoliate my face like it says it has an
exfoliating formula but I don't know if
that's like a chemical exfoliator or
what this looks so pretty like in the
light this is what the mask looks like
I'm not sure if you can really see it's
full glitter potential the glitters are
holographic
you can't tell on camera at least I
can't tell my viewfinder but the
glitters are holographic and it looks so
freakin cool
so I'm not gonna lie this definitely
speaks to the 12 year old and me like if
I would have discovered this mask as a
young teen as a preteen I would have
loved it would thought it was so cool
but what matters is the formula and what
matters is what it's gonna do to my skin
because if it does nothing then there is
no point I'm just putting freaking
glitter all over my face I'm gonna be
leaving this on for 30 minutes so I'm
gonna go play with my dogs and wait for
30 minutes and I'll be right back I'm
Mac I'm like so winded right now I was
running outside with the dogs ah okay so
it has actually been 40 minutes since I
put on this face mask time got away from
me what can I say it has gotten really
really tight I think it's dry even
though when I touch certain spots its it
moves and it feels a little gooey it
still feels like it has completely dried
I'm just gonna start peeling off see
like this part right here since I put a
lot of product on here it's not
completely dry I definitely don't think
you need to apply too much of this I
don't think it'll dry completely if you
do okay
see like these spots here are not
completely dry okay keep going I think
less is more with this product we don't
get it in your hair okay so now that all
of that has been removed
I definitely applied too much in certain
areas so it didn't really dry down
completely but let's take a look at this
face so I'm not gonna lie my face does
feel a lot softer than it did before I
put on this mask like a lot softer so I
really love how my skin feels I also
don't feel like it irritated my skin at
all but as for how my skin looks I think
it looks exactly the same this is
probably one of those products I'm gonna
have to use two or three times to really
see if I like it or not but I don't
really see a difference in how my skin
looks it feels softer it feels smoother
but I don't think it looks more radiant
I think it looks pretty normal like how
it did before I applied the mask and
this is a $42 mask so I don't know if
it's worth it or not I don't want to
just throw it out and be like this sucks
I do want to give it a fair shot so I'm
gonna keep trying it but based on first
impressions I'm gonna be completely
honest with you it ain't all that I
think it's a little bit gimmicky and for
the price I think there are other masks
on the market that claim to be hydrating
and radiance boosting that I actually
see a difference with but just
personally for me I don't know I don't
know if I'm into this also if you get it
on your hair it hurts like a mofo to
peel it off but anyway that was my
opinion on the new to face glow job I
don't think it's for me but I'm sure
there are a ton of people who really
like this I really don't feel like it
made a difference yes that's just my
opinion on this product let me know in
the comments below what you want to see
first impressions on or what products
you really want me to review leave them
in the comments below
