a chatty get ready I'm gonna be putting
on my makeup I actually wanted to
recreate this look I saw on Natasha's
and Ana's Instagram it's this picture
right here I'm not sure if you can see
it but I'm obsessed with the way Natasha
did her makeup it looks so beautiful
she used the new crystal topcoat in grey
brown on her lid and on her lips but she
used a grey lip liner underneath that I
do not have so I'm gonna try to recreate
something like that today I just love
this look so much so I want to recreate
it it's probably not gonna look anything
like this but I'm gonna try it's a very
simple look the last two tutorials on my
channel have been very dramatic so I
want to do something a little bit more
me simple I'm just gonna put on a
headband can you believe I lost all my
headbands like the ones I always put off
for tutorials that I like put them up
here you know I bet I don't know where
any of them are and I had like five of
them so I'm just gonna put this one on
for now I know you guys told me in my
last video that you wanted to see my ELF
haul and I actually filmed that for you
yesterday but it will be going up on
Monday I thought maybe two back-to-back
hollis was a little bit too much it was
giving me anxiety so I'm gonna be
posting that on Monday I'm going in with
my Smashbox photo finish primer Iser I
love this it's become like one of my
favorite primers of all time it's just
so hydrating now I'm gonna take a little
bit of this elf lock on face primer I
hauled this in my video yesterday so I
will talk about it in the home but I'm
gonna take a little bit of this guy it
is a very very tacky primer so I'm only
gonna take a little bit massaged it in
my fingers and just Pat this around my
t-zone area and then for foundation I'm
gonna be taking those you a high
coverage cream foundation I'm in the
shade fawn it's a little bit dark for me
like it has kind of a strong yellowy
undertone but I find that the other
colors just don't work for me at all so
this is the only one that semi works for
me and I like applying this with a
Beauty Blender because with a brush it's
just
way to full coverage and way to Matt you
cannot use too much of this product I
pumped that out once I'm this covered my
entire face and then some sometimes I
forget it's so full coverage I have to
relax like that was way too much let me
try to okay so I applied way too much I
tried my best to really blend that out
but I did go overboard a little go such
a long way with this foundation be very
very careful for a concealer I mean I'm
gonna start using other concealers I
know I try but I just keep going back to
this guy it's the best do little swipes
like that and you got like great
coverage that is the short tape shape I
was gonna I was gonna say is the Tarte
shaped tape if anybody's wondering I'm
using this on my eyelids as well to
prime them there has been so many cool
makeup launches that I'm so excited for
I cannot wait I love all of tarts
Holiday Collection that's really nice I
just really love the holiday collections
this year usually I'm like mmm kind of
whatever about them but this year a lot
of companies are coming out with a
really pretty holiday stuff I'm gonna
take a little bit of this concealer not
that I need it anywhere else on my face
just so everything kind of matches to
set everything down I'm gonna take my
Real Techniques b02 brush I love the new
blue powder collection or powder blue
collection it's so pretty I'm gonna take
this vanity Beauty Universal and visit
matte blotting powder I know a lot of
people are telling me that this is just
strictly a blotting powder it's not so
much a setting powder and I know it's a
blotting powder but I like using it as a
setting powder to me it works just as
good I'm gonna set around my mouth
because foundation really loves getting
into my smile lines
then I'm gonna set my concealer oblast
link these brushes are just so soft if
you haven't typed out the new powder
blue collection from Real Techniques I
recommend it especially if you like the
color blue it's very pretty
since the eyes are so simple I'm just
gonna go ahead and finish up the rest of
my face I'm gonna use the makeup geek
sunkissed fair-skinned bronzer I've only
used this a couple of times but I want
to test it out a little bit more I'm
gonna take the elf cheek cream and
powder brush and I'm going to a contour
this brush is awesome because it really
does work really well with cream and
powder products one thing I noticed
about this shoe a foundation I want to
give you guys like my full review on it
but I have been testing it out a lot
recently and I really like it but you
really have to blend it out very fast
because if you don't you'll kind of get
like splotches of the foundation dried
in certain areas so make sure you are
blending that out super super fast I'm
actually gonna go in with a fluffier
brush this is a stippling brush from
makeup forever and I'm just gonna be a
little bit more careless with it
in the photo she does look like super
contoured actually has like very
chiseled cheeks I'm gonna attempt to
give myself that but we have different
bone structure she's so pretty though
and my skin is actually looking way too
matte for this look but I am gonna do
myself up here in a little bit I feel
like I'm so horrible at recreating like
celebrity makeup I'm really bad at doing
like inspired makeup tutorials that's
why I don't do them that often but I
love trying she does look a little bit
more chiseled than I do so I'm going to
take my Catrice Prime and fine contour
palette and I'm going to take the
contour on this color pop brush I'm just
gonna add this right here to really
emphasize that contour and Natasha de
Nonna is probably my favorite makeup
artist I just love her style of makeup
and her technique she pretty much just
like throws eyeshadow on somebody's eye
and it looks exceptional and amazing I
don't know so yes I'm always always
inspired by her makeup and I'm gonna
take the essence pure nude highlighter
because she is a little bit more dewy on
the face this foundation is pretty matte
and I'm gonna go in with highlighter at
the end of this video but I do want to
add a little bit of something to the
skin so I'm gonna take this Wayne Goss
brush this is a number eleven brush and
I'm just gonna dust this
face
you see how it's kind of just like
bringing life back to the skin I love
this product that it's like two dollars
it's amazing just putting that
everywhere chest on the do on her chin
her cheeks so if her blush it doesn't
really look like she's wearing much of
anything but I am gonna add a little bit
of something just because we have so
much contour on and I wanna just want to
tie everything together I'm gonna take
the H&amp;amp;M blush in cameo pink and I'm just
gonna take a little bit of this on the
same brush we used for bronzer and I'm
just gonna pop a little bit of this onto
the cheeks okay so I think I'm gonna add
my highlight at the very very end and
I'm just gonna move on to the eyes so it
does look like a Natasha added a little
bit of something to the lid underneath
this top coat I don't know if she did or
not it just kind of looks like there's a
little bit of like a grey shadow put
down it's very very minimal so I'm gonna
take this eyeshadow called faux fur it's
from makeup geek I'm gonna take a fluffy
brush really really tap this off and
just lightly dust this color everywhere
on my lid
I'm just gonna start blending out the
edges of the crease my faux fur just
broke right there in the corner oh
that's what's making it break don't tap
it off on the eyeshadow I'm gonna take a
little bit of that eyeshadow on my lower
lash line but I'm not gonna bring it in
all the way I'm just gonna focus it on
the outer corners I'm also gonna put a
nude in my waterline kind of looks like
she has a little bit of a white in her
waterline but I really can't tell but it
doesn't look dark so I'm just gonna add
a little bit of nude this is the issue a
matte nude silk cream eyeliner
okay so now I'm gonna take the Natasha
Danone a chroma crystal topcoat in the
shade gray Brown and I'm going to apply
this on my lid this is the beautifulness
that's on her lids I just don't know how
much you applied it like if she applied
it to the whole lid or what but that's
what I'm gonna do
I've actually never used these before
they feel a little bit moosie kind of
like the color pop texture but they're
not as pigmented as the color pop ones
these are just meant to be kind of like
shimmery top coats and then the more you
apply a little more pigmented it gets
all right so it doesn't look like it's a
girl's eyeballs in the picture but I
actually really like this I think it is
stunning and ever it's really sparkly I
don't know if you guys can dub but it's
Betty to me I like it I'm gonna take my
Real Techniques bo4 brush why is this
wet why was this verse wet but no I'm
gonna take this brush that was weird and
I'm going to just blend out these edges
cuz some of this glitter went up into my
crease I'm gonna take the brush I used
on my lower lash line I'm gonna take
that I shadow again the faux fur and I'm
just gonna apply some more right here in
the crease she looks like she has a
little bit of this on the lower lash
line as well so I'm gonna take just a
little bit of it with my pinky
alright I think that's all I'm gonna
doing this Li at this point if you are
recreating this video I doubt it but
just go ahead and apply whatever mascara
you have I'm going to apply this
ridiculously priced mascara that I
bought just to review for you guys
it's nowhere near worth the money but I
have to use it because I bought it and
it's just sitting on my desk sometimes
and I'm like no no I have to use it I
bought it I have to use it so I'm just
gonna apply this mascara this is the
Kirsten blue button whatever I can't
even say his name
this is that like lacquer mascara I'm
gonna apply two coats of this to my top
and bottom lashes and then I will be
right back and now I'm gonna mess with
my brows a little bit more I'm just
gonna make them more feathery and this
pick her brows are very light and blonde
but they are pretty feathery so I'm
gonna make mine a little bit more
feathery a little bit more dramatic so
I'm gonna take my the bomb brow POW and
my number 10 royal and langnickel brush
and I am just going to brush my hair is
up make my brows a little bit fuller
and then I'm gonna take my Joshi mr.
brow room I wish it wasn't see-through
I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna comb
my brows up and now they're just
sticking up like this and I'm gonna wait
for them to set and then I will comb
through them a bit just to make them a
little bit more natural-looking
but we are almost done I'm actually
gonna go in with a brow bone highlight I
completely forgot to do that I'm gonna
take a brow bone highlight from a
certain palette that I cannot talk about
just yet and I know I've been hinting at
something for a really long time but I
promise it's coming soon so I'm gonna
take like my favorite highlighting a
shade for my brow bone ever because it's
like a mix between a satin and like a
pearl
it's so pretty so I'm gonna highlight my
brow bone with this just a little bit
she didn't have a ton of highlighting
going on and I'm gonna take that same
shade right into my inner corners okay
so we're almost done now I'm just gonna
apply some more highlight to my face and
then I'll go in with my lip combo
she's very highlighted but it's not like
ultra glittery or metallic or anything
it's basically just like light and it's
not too golden so I'm gonna take this
shade right here this is from the NARS
buff disable highlight palette and I'm
gonna take the lightest shade
and then she has a lot of highlight
right at the tip of her nose I know
people don't like to highlight the tip
of the nose but honestly to each their
own do what makes you happy I love how I
think that's help for my nose the only
thing I don't like about my nose is okay
let me show you do you see how my nose
highlight looks like a straight line cuz
I have like two little bones right here
like one right here one right here so it
kind of connects and looks like a
straight line versus her amazing nose it
looks like a little dot see expectation
reality but this will do before I go in
with my lip color I am just gonna set my
face so that everything melts right into
the skin I'm gonna use my morphe prep
and set setting spray this just makes
everything melt right in no I'm just
gonna brush down my brows a little bit
so they're not looking too crazy I'm
gonna go ahead and pop on my lip color
I'm gonna mix two colors together
because I really want to use point zero
she's wearing a grey lip the point zero
is obviously way too Brown but it does
have that gray undertone I just don't
have like a really grey lip believe it
or not so I am gonna mix a little bit of
dubai from all four cosmetics this is
their liquid lipstick I'm gonna mix
these two colors together see what I get
it to have those two right there
I'm using my Linda Hallberg lip brush
okay so this isn't as great as that is
but I think that turned out pretty
nicely I like the combo of those two
colors actually I had never tried that
before and I mix coin zero with
everything I really like that okay so
I'm gonna go back into the crystal top
coat in grey brown and Natasha I also
use this on her lips it looks like she
used it like right in the center so
that's what I'm going to do oh this
totally makes your lips more silvery and
more grey I'm pretty much putting this
all over my entire lips but I'm focusing
the most of the product like right in
the center right there okay guys so that
completes this video this was my attempt
at recreating this makeup look I don't
think it looks that similar but I do
like how my look turned out anyway and
I'm actually going out to dinner tonight
so I'm totally gonna continue to wear
this out to dinner cuz I really really
like it so you guys that completes this
