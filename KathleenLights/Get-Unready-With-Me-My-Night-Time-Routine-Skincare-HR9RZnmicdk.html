my nighttime routine is basically
showing you all the steps I do at
nighttime before I go to bed so my
nighttime skincare routine is included
in this video and a lot of you guys have
been asking me about my skincare routine
and pretty much my nighttime routine is
my major skincare routine in the morning
I just wash my face and put on
moisturizer so here is my skincare
routine as well so it's like a
two-for-one sort of by the way I finally
did my roots I had like giant giant
roots coming out and I finally did them
the only thing I have left to do is just
tone my roots because my roots came out
a little bit warmer than the rest of my
hair my hair lifts really really warm
like not ashy at all I just have to add
a toner so it can match like the more
less warm part of my hair which I'll
probably be doing that today or tomorrow
I'm not exactly sure um nothing guys
asked or care just sleding letting you
know what's happening ok so I think that
is all I have to say if you guys want to
see my nighttime routine then just keep
on watching
so I always start off with pure extra
virgin coconut oil I use this pass and
eye makeup remover it is amazing it does
come as a solid but I wait until it's
nice and liquidy and it looks pretty
gross I know but I just massage this
around my eyes because it really does a
great job of breaking up my mascara and
it takes off all of my eyeliner even
waterproof mascara the consistency and
because it's so oily it just does a
great great job of breaking down all
that product and I especially love it
because it does not burn my eyes and I
have a lot of trouble finding a really
good makeup remover that doesn't so I
love it it's organic it's amazing and
it's really really good for your skin
then I just go in with some cleansing
towelettes these are the ones for
sensitive skin from the Target brand but
they are compared to these simple face
wipes that I absolutely love I love
these because it does not burn my face
and I use these on my eyebrows
especially just to get off all that
makeup and then I clean up the rest of
my face with this I like to do this step
before I wash my face just because for
me it ensures that I am going to be
taking off all my makeup
after that I go ahead and wash my face
my Holy Grail face wash is the purity
cleanser from philosophy but as you can
tell I'm all out of it I also really
really love my old a total effects
blemish control cleanser I use this one
about once a week because it has
salicylic acid acne in it and it's
really good for my skin I use this with
my doctor sponge I love this little guy
it's a great gentle exfoliator it gets
deep down into my pores when I'm washing
my face and it is amazing and very very
inexpensive it is a cognac sponge and
I'm just obsessed with it I've actually
seen pretty much a lot of improvements
in my skin after I started using this as
opposed to using just my fingers I use
the white one which is for sensitive
skin but they have different sponges
that cater to different skin types so
when you first get it it is a hard
sponge and then you just rinse it
underneath some water and squish it and
squish it and squish it until it's nice
and fluffy
I really love this old Lake Lenser
because it is a cream and it doesn't
foam up on my skin
once I am washing my face cleansers that
tend to foam up on my skin like there's
a lot of bubbles tend to dry out my face
really badly and since I have naturally
really dry skin
I prefer cleansers that are creamy and
moisturizing and even though purity does
kind of foam up a bit on my skin it
doesn't dry out my skin at all that one
is my absolute favorite I recommend
purity 100% it is amazing and if you're
looking for a good drugstore face wash
that has salicylic acid in it then
definitely the Olay Total Effects seven
and one it is also really great so after
that I will just go ahead and wash my
face once a week I like to exfoliate and
I love the st. Ives a blemish control
green tea scrub but this one also has
salicylic acid in it salicylic acid
really helps with my skin it just looks
like this it's nice and green and it has
really really really fine micro
exfoliating beads in it this has been my
favorite one for a really long time I
haven't found anything high-end or
drugstore that compares to this this one
just really improves my skin if my skin
is doing really bad I will use this
about two times or three times a week
and my face just improves immensely I
love this stuff
after that I just rinsed my face and I
go ahead and use my eye cream right now
I'm using the tarte maracuja brighter
eye treatment
um it's not amazing but it's what I'm
using right now I'm still on the hunt
for the perfect eye cream I just like to
massage this underneath my eyes
well basically around my entire eye area
and then after I go in with my
moisturizer this is my nighttime
moisturizer it is the origins
high-potency
night immense mousse riser this is a
godsend it is my all-time favorite
moisturizer of all time I was using the
Loreal texture Perfector serum
underneath this but I found that this
worked even better on its own it is a
new purchase but I've been using it
non-stop and it is so great I even
recommend it for oily skin because it's
not too too thick but it does hydrate
your skin really well it doesn't have
like a greasy weird texture at all I'm
obsessed with it
so besides the obvious brushing my teeth
and putting on deodorant and all that
good stuff
there are two other things I do right
before I hop into bed I like to take my
sleep lavender chamomile body lotion and
my sleep lavender chamomile body mist
and I like to rub this all over my body
here I'm wearing pants but I did rub
some right before I started filming I
like to rub this all over my arms
it is a nice moisturizer that doesn't
feel too greasy on my skin I love this
stuff and then I just spray myself with
the sleep of body mist and spray some on
my bed and it's just such a nice
Pleasant and soothing scent so after
that I just throw the pillows on that
side of the bed and I hop into my bed
and usually I do this part all by myself
now that Danny is on deployment but
tonight I sleep with my little Sofia
