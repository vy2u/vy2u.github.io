kind of like a get ready with me like a
chitchat a chatty get ready I forgot I
was calling it that
a chatty get ready that's why I have no
makeup on just my eyebrows done and done
wrong I do not like how they came out
today anyway today's video is in
collaboration with a cosmetics so yes it
is sponsored by a cosmetics and actually
when it caused metics reached out to me
they were just like hey you want to send
you a box of stuff and you could film a
video using the products and I was like
yes I love you if you guys have been
watching my videos for a while like I'm
talking about like ogee days I was
obsessed with the it cosmetics bye bye
redness I used it as my foundation like
every single day and then I lost it and
I never bought it again and I love their
like hombre bronzer that I have and
their blush brush that I love that I
have anyway so they actually let me talk
about this really quick the reason why
things are weird is because it's a super
gloomy day outside I'm talking like
rainy and I decided I was like okay
since it's so dark in this room and I'm
gonna use my ring light to film and then
do you hear this I broke my ring light
literally five minutes ago I went to use
it and then it fell and shattered which
sucks cuz that's what I used to film my
cat chats video which I was going to
film one today so I'm gonna have to film
it I'm gonna have to film I cut shots
somewhere else okay so I'm going to go
ahead and get started and this is the
box they sent with some of their
products and I can thank Porter for that
I look so weird so I'm going to do a
full face of makeup and I'm actually
gonna be using my cosmetics naturally
pretty pal if you saw my yearly
favorites this made to my top three like
favorite palettes of 2014 so I'm gonna
use my equals Magic's not read a pretty
palette I don't know why I'm talking in
this accent that's weird I'm gonna start
off with my face I'm using the it
cosmetics your skin but better CC cream
and I've used this before and I really
like it it's like a full-on coverage
it's kind of crazy that it's a CC cream
but it has SPF 50 which that's that's a
lot
I'm going to use the shade light which
looks really dark but I'm self-tanning
right now I'm going to use this brush
from it cosmetics called the all-over
weight heavenly luxe complexion
perfection brush okay this seems like
this is going to match me because my
neck is this smells good
my neck is darker than my face but I
wonder if they have a lighter shade like
fair or something I hope that they do
because if they do not this is going to
be way too dark for people with really
fair skin this has really good coverage
and why is it a CC cream is this have
like really good benefits chemical free
sunscreen paraben free anti-aging
hydration serum oh so it has anti-aging
properties in it which most of the
cosmetics stuff has anti-aging
properties like dermatologists they work
with dermatologists to really bring out
like the best makeup that has skincare
benefits if that makes sense know that
this has a pump by the way if you click
on the link below you can use the coupon
code love it 20 out leave the coupon
code down below so you click on the link
and you use that coupon code and you get
20% off your whole order if your order
is over 25 so 20% off of $25 and you get
free standard shipping with that code as
well soluble oh and I don't get money
for you clicking on the link just
pointing that out
oh they also sent me fair okay so this
would probably work when I'm not so
Fanning Wow
meringue I'm gonna try this out
I've never tried this before this is the
it cosmetic why did I say that like that
it cosmetics celebration foundation
illumination I've heard Dana talk about
this I think Dana wait I've heard
someone talk about this and they really
love it full coverage anti-aging
illuminating foundation with hydrolyzed
collagen peptides antioxidants and drops
of light technology I like that this is
in the shade medium which probably will
match me best now that I am
and so I'm just gonna put that on my
face I've never tried this before so I
don't know how this works maybe I should
be using a more compact brush this is
also for my cosmetics it is their this
because it doesn't have any excellent I
definitely recommend you using if you're
going to try out this powder I
definitely recommend you using it with
like a flat top brush if you want
coverage like more covered like full-on
coverage if you want to use this by
itself like as a powder foundation I'm
just adding a little bit to set the CC
cream this might have been too dark for
me though since it is like a foundation
you know it's not translucent my friends
but wow I really like that because no
joke like not even joking
it doesn't even look like I have powder
on my face I guess that's the
illumination part but I think if you
have oily skin you would still like this
cuz it's not like dewy it's a powder so
that's cool I'm impressed
a lot of you guys know that I'm in the
process of moving trying to record a lot
of videos so that I can have videos up
while I move I'm moving back to Florida
a lot of you guys thought I was moving
back to Miami but I'm not I will tell
you guys to where I'm moving to when I
get there I'm gonna put on some
concealer and maybe I should have put on
under I can see there before powdering
but sure you live in your learn I guess
I'm gonna use the buy buy under eye I've
heard so many good things about this
I've always wanted to buy it um and I
always forget when I walk into Ulta I'm
gonna use this one in the shade light
I'm just gonna squish it too onto my
face this is so strange because I never
do like first impressions or like me
putting on products for the very first
time on camera since I'm a disaster oh
that is thick my friends so I'm going to
use the other side of this brush to
blend that out I honestly didn't realize
it was going to be this thick this is a
definitely definitely a thicker
consistency just keep that in mind
I used way too much of this product um
don't do that but it does blend nicely
so far like this but this is
something that's going to crease I know
it for a fact so I do have to set it
immediately I'm just going to use that
same powder foundation only in the shade
light I'm going to set that with that
same brush I like this brush so much if
you see it buy it because you can do
your foundation with this side and then
your concealer with this side this is
like perfect storing this sucks
but for travel purposes this is like a
perfect traveling brush that covered
really nicely that that can see they're
covered really nicely I think you would
really like this concealer just make
sure to set it right away and use very
little this video is all over the place
it cosmetics is gonna want you to be
like why did we emo her she's a disaster
I agree so it's gonna be like a natural
look honestly I'm gonna do my favorite
look using this palette like it's my
go-to I do it all the time I'm actually
going to climb with that same concealer
I always do this I always use concealer
to prime so that is what I'm going to do
I'm going to take sheer joy and I'm
going to apply this to my entire lid to
set that concealer I'm going to pack on
this color right here this actually just
called their transforming pearl shade it
has a little bit of shimmer to it and I
am going to pack this on my entire lid
according to it cosmetics this is the
kind of eyeshadow that you can put on
top of any eyeshadow and it's just gonna
make it a little bit shimmery but I
never do that I like to use it on its
own I'm gonna bring it into here to
highlight as well oh my gosh am I too
far yes Kathleen you are so I brought
you in closer
that was my fault I'm sorry and then
take mocha this is oh I'm gonna take
mocha this is my favorite eyeshadow in
this palette which is like a weird khaki
brown matte khaki green brown matte
cracky cracky khaki
uh-huh what I have a lot of coffee today
I have had so I'm going to take this and
I'm just gonna put this into the crease
and the outer V of my I know it looks
weird but I really love this eye
shadow it's more love this eyeshadow I'm
going to take the same transforming
pearl and just apply it to my lid again
then I'm going to take mocha and just
apply this to my lower lashline then I'm
going to take sheer joy and this is
going to be my bra sheer joy and it's
gonna be my brow bone highlight use this
eyeliner this is the it cosmetics
obviously black brown eyeliner
waterproof eyeliner and then I'm going
to add mascara and this is there
hello lashes extensions 24-hour lash
extensions fiber mascara this is two
coats of new mascara what do you think I
don't know if I like this honestly I
don't think I'm a fan of this only
because it's like very lengthening and
I'm more of like a clumpy spidery
volumizing kind of girl and people don't
like that look but I really do so if
you're into length then you will
definitely like this well update I love
this on my lower lashes holy crap this
little ball makes it so perfect to make
them so long
no gusta for top photo mucho gusto para
bajo anyway how have you guys been I
feel like I haven't been able to
interact with you guys as much as I
usually do like on my videos because of
like the moving process and I'm so busy
but I love you guys forever don't you
forget it I feel bad that my lat
that like my last sponsored video was
like two weeks ago and I like to space
them out a lot more than that if I do
any sponsor videos in the future I don't
want to do like more than two a month I
post three times a week three times a
week so I always want to give you really
like constant content in between them
and I would only do sponsored videos
from like reliable things like Ulta I
it and then it cosmetics you know not
like a random brand like I don't know
okay so now that the eyes are done very
very simple I'm gonna finish up my face
and I was so excited when I saw this I
am so excited right now this is the my
sculpted face palette by it cosmetics of
Karan
this is a contour palette I'm so excited
I'm so happy it has like mirrors I had a
contour I'm so freakin excited
the only thing missing I would say is
like a banana shade you know like the
yellowy shade I wish I wish it would
have had one of those I think I'm gonna
take this one right here that's who like
maybe this one this one here it's like a
neutral color oh this is the heavenly
luxe angled radiance brush I think this
is great specifically for this shade I
think this would be a great item in to
flip you off a great contour of shade
for fair skin you see it's a really
neutral not too warm not too cool
perfect for contouring and then look at
this this is perfect for deeper skin
tones to contour well I'm impressed with
the color selection
okay so I just added a very natural
contour and I'm going to try to write in
with this white I know that's super
stark and really scary and this might
not go so well but I'm just going to try
okay that brushes by can you tell did
that make a difference what do you think
did that make a difference
so how many of you guys watch scandal
like let's talk about scandal in the
comments below please can we talk about
scandal um it came back like the winter
finale or what whatever I came back and
don't worry I'm not gonna give any
spoilers it's okay I'm gonna give any
spoilers but oh my god oh my god holy
crap and I just want to say that I am
team Jake Ballard 100% I love Jake so
much oh my god he's such a BAM okay so
now I'm going to add simpler simpler and
I don't do blush this bright like this
is hella bright so I'm actually going to
clean off the foundation brush I use and
use this as a blush brush and just focus
it on a bottom oh it's a lot less scary
than I thought it was going to be this
is oh I didn't even tell you it's gone
this is the CC radiance ombre blush in
genesee quoi and it's so cool because
you kind of get three blushes in one it
goes from like a super pinky reddish
color to a light a milky pink so that's
awesome that I really like they I think
gave like a nice like blush of color the
only thing I do not like about this
product is that it's not like refillable
like the Anastasia one so that sucks I
don't know if you could refill these I'm
going to highlight using this shade
right here which seems really scary but
it does have like a shimmery effect to
it ooh
very glowy which I really like but
warning if you are anything darker than
my skin tone this is going to look white
on you this is for very skin I would
definitely recommend this for
fair-skinned nothing past medium skin
tones even though it has this really
nice shade and this one right here
that's perfect for deeper skin tones
everything else these four colors suit
more light skin tone which is nice
because I feel like a lot of the time
contour palettes don't have anything for
lighter skin tones but I love it I
really do I think the blend I think it
blends really nicely okay so they sent
me this and I already have it and it's
in my purse like every day and I love
this this is the it cosmetics by the
vitality lip flush in genesee quoi it's
like clear but this is so I have to show
you this this is so cool you put it on
the back your hand and yeah it's clear
we gonna and then like instantly it
starts to turn like pink I don't know if
you can tell but like with the warmth of
your lips it turns into like a really
pretty baby pink shade can you see it
it gets darker as like the hours wear on
I had it for a really long time okay so
I'm almost done to finish off my look
I'm going to do my lips and I'm going to
use this lip liner in the shade buff
nude it has a sharpener on the bottom
that's cool this is the waterproof lip
liner stain your lips but better I'm
excited I love lip liners oh my god this
is so creamy this is so much like the
Mac Pro Longwear that I love only
creamier if that's even possible I'm
gonna I love it I love it took a deep
Beijing nude I really like it to go on
top I'm going to use this lipstick this
is the vitality lip flush in damsel it's
kind of similar
okay guys so that completes this like
really just relaxed getting ready video
I would say these standout products
for me are definitely the CC cream I
really loved more than I thought I would
this hombre blush I think it's beautiful
and let's see I really really love this
lip liner this brush is so amazing like
so good for traveling and stuff and I
actually really liked the buy buy under
eye I definitely used a lot more than I
should but I really liked it if you guys
haven't tried this CC cream I highly
recommend it this feels so good on my
face and yeah you guys know that this is
an honest video because I don't lie and
it cosmetics is a great brand I even
told you guys that I wasn't a fan of
this mascara I keep it real 100% so I
definitely highly recommend the products
that I just told you guys about I think
they're really good so you haven't
arrived of this video because I feel
like it's 50 minutes long already
maybe not 50 but it's 20 minutes or more
it's more than 20 minutes oh my god
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if haven't already and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
