tutorial on this look it's a very strong
makeup look at least for me and I
actually had a mishap well this whole
video was a hot mess but I'm still gonna
post it anyway the foundation color
didn't match because it's myself tan
shade and I'm not tan right now and then
while I was using my cocoa contour kit
I was contouring with the cool tone
color here and then I accidentally
dipped my brush into dark cocoa without
looking and then stamped it on my
forehead here but I loved the eye makeup
so much this is the second time that
I've done it um not on camera I decided
to film it because I wore this I look
the other day and I loved it so I
decided to film it for you since all my
looks on my channel are very natural
daytime appropriate I wanted to switch
it up so this is the lobby I came up
with and if you want to see how to get
this look then just keep watching so I'm
going to prime my eyes using the Mac
prep and prime 24 hour extended eye base
this is by far my favorite colorless
primer this is an honest hacia eyeshadow
in the shade stone and I'm going to use
this as my transition shade just buffing
this into my crease so everything blends
nicely on top this is a Mac Pro Longwear
Paint Pot in the shade genuine treasure
I'm not exactly sure if this was limited
edition not I bought mine on the Mac
website not that long ago either so I
just popped that on my entire lid and
now I'm taking the more feet I shadow in
the shade deep skin and I'm blending
that into my crease some more just to
warm it up then I'm taking makeup geeks
White Lies eyes shadow and highlighting
with that now for my favorite part I'm
gonna add fix+ to my brush and I'm going
into the urban decay eye shadow in the
shade
dog it's a super super sparkly eye
shadow it's one of their moon dust
shadows
it's so worth it I love it so I applied
that to my entire lid and I'm taking
makeup geeks biddin I shout out and on a
tiny little blending brush I'm just
precisely adding this into the crease
and that's all I pretty much it
then I took deep skin again from morphe
and I'm just blending everything out so
things are nice and seamless I'm going
to take uhm shimma shimma by makeup geek
and White Lies and layer them on top of
each other in my inner corner and now
I'm going to add just like a pop of
color something a little bit different I
decided to add some green eyeliner and
this is from Joey it's called their
liquid shimmer eyeliner and this is in
the shade Lynx so I'm just applying a
tiny little wing super easy nothing too
fancy just a little pop of something so
now I'm going to prime my face using the
Too Faced and hangover RX primer and
then I went in with the covergirl stay
luminous foundation stay luminous
foundation and then I realized oh this
is not my shade this is my summer shave
ooh C's but I just went with it anyway
you know mistakes happen sometimes
okay so I'm just gonna blend that in and
try my best now I'm going to apply some
concealer just to see if I can help with
the color situation so I'm using more
than I normally do but this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
15 fair and I'm just highlighting
applying this under my eyes all over my
face and I'm gonna blend that in with a
real techniques blush brush
so yeah you see me blend my concealer in
about a million times so I decided to
skip over that now I'm going to take my
Too Faced cocoa contour kit this is a
real techniques setting brush and I'm
going to set my under eye concealer
using the light cocoa shade which is
like the whitish shade in the palette
and then I'm setting everywhere else I
applied the concealer taking this morphe
pencil brush I'm going to take that
eyeshadow called deep skin buy more feet
and I'm going to blend that underneath
my eyes this is an eyeshadow by NARS
it's one of their dual intensity
eyeshadows and I filmed this before the
makeup geek dual chrome eyeshadows came
out so I would have just used a maked
pink one because it's much cheaper but I
had the NARS one so I use it now I'm
going to go in with the Clinique chubby
lash mascara this is like their Burgundy
one and I think it gives a cool little
twist to the look so that completes the
eyes and now I'm going to go ahead and
finish the face this is a foundation
palette from mascara cosmetics I follow
her on Instagram and I follow her blog
for a really long time so this is a
really really cool concept I'm going to
take the brush that came with it and I'm
gonna use that contour shade at the
cream it's a cream palette by the way
I'm going to use the contour shade to
just outline my face with that pointy
part and then I'm going to flip the
brush over and just blend out that cream
contour this is the perfect shade
because it has like that nice actually
undertone so it's perfect for contouring
now I'm gonna go back into the to face
coke contour kit and I don't know why
I'm holding it out to the side like that
like that's super weird I'm holding out
of them lines so I'm just gonna start
contouring my cheekbones with the ash
shihr' shade in this kit I want
something a little bit more dramatic and
this is where I accidentally put the
wrong bronzer on my forehead and I'm
like freaking out like hey you put the
warm bronzer you're supposed to put the
ashy one and then things went south a
little bit but I hope and I fixed it a
little bit so now I'm going to take the
Urban Decay blush this is in the shade
rapture I believe I'll have the correct
name down below but I'm pretty sure it's
rapture and this is a super dark blush
but lightly applied it's really pretty
so that's what I did and then to
highlight my face I went in with the
Natasha Danone aglow palette in the
shade zero one light and I highlight my
cheekbones in my nose and any other
place I would normally highlight so to
finish off the look I'm going to apply
this color pop ultra matte lip in the
shade trap and then as that completes
makeup look I really hope you guys
