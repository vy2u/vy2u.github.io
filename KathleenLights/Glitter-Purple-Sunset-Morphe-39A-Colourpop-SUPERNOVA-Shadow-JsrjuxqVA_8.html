look I'm wearing I really wanted to get
on camera and try out this palette for
the first time with you guys this is the
morphe 39a palette I'm sure a lot of you
guys know but morphe recently like just
rebranded they have a new logo now
they're changing things up getting more
creative and I really love the direction
this brand is going in and this is one
of their new holiday palettes I'm pretty
sure this one is limited edition when I
saw this I was like wow that is so
different and so cool I decided to play
around with these shades right here I
know typical for me but I really really
wanted to use all the greens in this
palette but everybody's doing that
already every time I see someone upload
a video with this palette you're all
using the green shades in this palette
which totally makes sense because
immediately when I open this that is the
first thing I looked at this matte olive
green right here this right here
beautiful it's so beautiful so it makes
sense why everyone wants to use the
green shades so I thought you know what
let me trickle into these shades right
here and I really really love how this
look turned out I mean I'm not gonna lie
the star of the show like the mane the
big kahuna is this color pop supernova
shadow in the shade moonlit is it I
don't think I've ever said that before
I'm not cool enough but wow this is the
most beautiful glittery liquid eyeshadow
ever it is oh my god it's like what I
have right here I love it today's the
first time I actually used one of these
supernova shadows from colour-pop and I
have to say I think I have fallen in
love it's the first time I use it but I
cannot wait to use all of these shades
they are incredible I can't wait to see
what colors they come out with in the
future because I love it at first I
wanted this video to be a full face of
first impressions but I quickly realized
I didn't have a full face the first
impression so I'm gonna use a ton of
products I already have and love there's
a ton of old faves in this video but I
really wanted to try out this palette
for the first time and I have
I love it so far really wanted to try
these out and I have a new concealer I
try out in this video as well but anyway
if you want to see how I got this look
and you want to see my opinion on some
of these new products I'm trying out
then just keep on watching
alright so my lids are already primed
and set they're ready for eye shadow and
I'm gonna take this shade right here and
I'm gonna start working this color into
my crease I'm gonna start building this
color up it's the lightest crease shade
here in this row so it does take a
little bit of building now I'm going to
go into this delicious little orange
shade and I'm pretty much gonna do the
exact same thing only I'm gonna focus
this on the outer corners as well and
then I will drag it up into the crease
area I honestly have no idea what I'm
even doing for today's look I honestly
just wanted to try out this palette to
see how the formula was you know I'm
gonna drag this color all the way in and
then start blending it up
all right now I'm gonna take this color
with my finger why did I use my right
finger I'm gonna dip it into this like
reddish pink shade and I'm gonna apply
that to my entire lid
honestly I've just started applying all
my lid shades with my finger they're
just it's just so much easier to use
your finger and the color payoff is just
way better when you use your finger I'm
gonna go back into that orange shade we
used right before this and I'm gonna
blend out this brush head something else
on me
now I'm going to take this really pretty
vibrant purple right here and gotta do
pretty much the exact same thing I did
with the orange a little while ago
I'm gonna go back into lid sheet and I'm
just gonna intensify it here a bit even
though it doesn't really matter because
I am gonna be going over it with
something really exciting that I've been
dying to use but just to bring out some
oomph from underneath you know I would
totally leave the look like this I would
just add my lower lash line but we are
not done playing around with stuff so we
shall continue but I am definitely gonna
do this to look one of these days like
just just like this okay I'm gonna take
a more stiff packing brush like this one
from ELF and I'm gonna go back into
these purple cranberry shade and I'm
gonna intensify the outer corners make
them a lot purple here in that area
I'm gonna go back into this orange and
I'm just gonna blend out the edges of
everything and warm up the crease even
more okay so this palette doesn't have a
brow bone shade or anything like that so
I'm gonna take the Anastacio single
eyeshadow in the shade bone and I'm
gonna use that from a brow bone and just
really clean up that area under there
and then to add a little bit of a sheen
I'm gonna take a brow bone highlight
from a pallet I'm so sorry guys I've
been hinting at this forever but I
promise it's coming soon you'll see more
very soon okay so now I want to use one
of these guys I have been dying to try
these on camera for you guys i've
swatched them they look amazing I've
seen a ton of videos on them already
these are the new color pops supernova
eyeshadows they're very similar to the
Stila magnificent like liquid glitter I
shall very similar and today I'm gonna
use this delicious purple one I know
it's gonna cover up that really pretty
pink shade but I have just been dying to
try these I'm just gonna apply this to
my lid right yeah oh
okay so I'm noticing that if you don't
blend it right away it will dry down and
stay there which is a great thing
because you want these to dry down but
make sure you are blending really fast
this color is so pretty okay so I'm
gonna let that dry for a second and
while that's drying I'm gonna clean up
all of this fallout even though doing
that was completely pointless because
I'm still gonna add to my shadows back
into this purple shade and the same
thing I'm just gonna be focusing this on
the outer corners and then again back
into that orange I do want to add some
depth and darkness to the outer corners
so I'm gonna take this shade right here
it's a very dark dark matte purple and
I'm just gonna be adding this to the
outer corners
I'm just taking a little bit of this
color right there in the crease where
the glitter and the orange you need just
a little bit okay so we're gonna quickly
move on to the face before we finish up
the eyes I'm gonna use two primers today
I'm taking the Smashbox primer oil and
I'm mixing it in with the Becca
backlight priming filter and I'm gonna
apply this to my face it's gonna make me
extremely dewy extremely hydrated and
that's what I want so I never use my
Dior foundation because I have a theory
that it's breaking me out so I really
want to put it to the test because I
haven't used any months for that reason
so I'm using the Dior air flash
foundation and I'm using a real
techniques sponge to apply it all right
so I have new concealers I want to try
out for you guys today I have been using
my Tarte shaped tape for what feels like
a million years how did I get these on
my finger there was a shadow on this
concealer Urban Decay came out with new
concealers and they're the all nighter
waterproof full coverage concealers they
have an all nighter foundation that I
love I don't really use it that much
anymore but when my skin was having like
major issues and I was breaking out a
lot that was my go-to foundation I used
it all the time so I'm really excited to
see if I like these I'm a little bit
nervous because I do have kind of like a
dry under eye but I'm nice and dewy
today so let's see how this goes the
only thing I really don't like the color
selection Urban Decay comes out with
it's like I can never find my concealer
shade ever when I use the Naked skin
concealer that I also really love I have
to use two shades with that one as well
I'm gonna be mixing light warm and fair
neutral together because this one is
just way too white for me but this one
this one's so yellow well you know what
let's try this one I'm not sure how much
I'm gonna add or how much I'm supposed
to add so I'm just gonna apply a little
bit at first and then I'll blend it in
by the way I'm using my Real Techniques
blending sponge complexion blending
sponge I think ooh this one isn't as
yellow as I thought it was gonna be okay
I take back what I said earlier well
this has a really great coverage and
very matte but I think I really like it
like that blend it out so easily can I
apply a little bit more to this side
okay so this applies freakin beautifully
with a sponge really like it wow I
really like this and I I know I just put
it on but I really like this definitely
make sure you have hydrated under eyes
before you apply this so I'm just adding
a little bit here just to highlight the
face a bit more I'm just gonna apply a
little bit like two dots there a little
bit here and so on my chin you know my
mouth here
I just want to even out the face oh my
gosh I love this concealer I thought I
wasn't gonna like it honestly like in
the back of my mind I really thought I
wasn't gonna like it just because I'm so
used to my shape tape it's my go-to I
use it every time I do my makeup and I
thought this one was gonna fall short
for me but I really like it now that
it's set it is creasing a bit I like I
do see some creases but nothing too bad
I'm gonna take my outer powder from
glossier my favorite powder so whoo I'm
just gonna set my under eyes
I'm just gonna lightly set the rest of
my face with just a little bit of powder
I'm not even reading into the powder
just with what's left on the brush now
we can finish up the eyes okay so I'm
basically gonna be using the exact same
shades I used on my lid except for that
like bright pink so I'm gonna start with
this shade and I'm just gonna apply this
on my lower lash line using this tiny
little dose of colors brush duel then
I'm gonna go into that orange shade we
were using in the crease earlier and I'm
gonna play this right on top then I'm
going to take this vibrant purple shade
and I'm also going to drag this color
all the way across and then I'm gonna go
into the deep shade right here and I'm
just gonna focus this color on the very
outer corners of my lower lash line
I'm gonna apply some eyeliner to my
waterline I'm gonna take this Marc
Jacobs
Highliner matte gel crayon in the shade
grapevine and then I'm gonna go back
into that dark dark purple okay so to
highlight my inner corners I'm gonna go
in with the same highlight I'm gonna use
on my face this is the joy powder
highlight in the shade ice this was
limited edition I'm so sorry I have like
this little baby and honestly I don't
know why they made this limited edition
because this highlight is so unique and
beautiful so I'm just gonna pop this on
my inner corners I never use them as
citizen makeup on my channel you guys
know this but I really wanted to use
this on my face so I might as well just
use it on the eyes as well I'm really
upset because I know for a fact Juhi
changed the formula of their highlights
which I don't know why they would do
something so ridiculous
cuz they had amazing amazing highlights
but I just recently purchased citrine
again because mine did break I don't
know if they changed the formula because
a lot of them were breaking but the new
citrine is nowhere near as good as the
original citrine I don't know if I got a
dud but mine is nowhere near as wet and
reflective as my original citrine which
makes me so upset
see like this little one has the
original formula but anyway before I go
on a crazy rant about that because I'm
gonna pop on some mascara yes I bought
this mascara after I tweeted that the
Gigi Hadid collection was just like too
pricey for Maybelline I went out and
bought the mascara and two of the lip
liners that's all I purchased just
because that face palette was like this
is a fiber mascara but I'm not gonna use
the fibers today because I am gonna pop
on some falsies so I'm only gonna what
just the fiber I'm only gonna use this
side and we're gonna see how it goes
actually you know what I'm not gonna
play falsies in today's look I'm gonna
try out this whole fiber fiber situation
see how good this mascara is I'm getting
some clumps it is a voluminous which is
nice but let me get my little clump
destroyer this is the morphe b71 I'm
just gonna brush out those clumps okay
so I'm pretty sure the way that these
fiber mascaras work you're supposed to
kind of do like a layer off the regular
mascara then you're supposed to get the
fiber part brush some fibers onto your
mascara on again I to have a fiber
mascara and those were the instructions
I don't know if it's the same for this
one well we're just gonna do it I think
it made the hairs a little bit longer
it's still a bit clumpy
okay so I'm just gonna finish up playing
this mascara to my lower lashline and I
won't be right back okay so the eyes are
officially done I don't even know how I
feel about this mascara just yet
I don't know these fibers are a little
strange I mean it's not bad I like it
but I don't know I have to try it out a
little bit more but anyway I'm rounding
the skin with my Physicians Formula
butter bronzer and then to add a little
bit more warmth I'm going in with this
Milani baked bronzer in the shade Dulce
and I'm applying this everywhere for a
blush I'm going in with this Burt's
beats Burt's Bees blush in the shade
toasted a cinnamon and I have been
loving it and then for highlight I'm
going in with that jus a highlight in
the shade ice and it's so pretty it's
like a white with a beautiful golden
undertone I love it it's like a peachy
golden because it's not just like
straight-up gold it's like a peachy gold
I love it so pretty
bring it back Joey please okay and then
to finish off this look I'm going on
with my lip color I'm gonna take the LA
girl ultimate intense state lip liner in
the shade forever bare and I'm just
filling in my entire lips with this and
when I saw it I was like and this looks
horrible I don't like how it looks so I
went in with the Stila liquid lipstick
in the shade and I'm applying that right
on top to cover up the peach enos and to
add a little bit more mouths to the look
and I like that way better but anyway
