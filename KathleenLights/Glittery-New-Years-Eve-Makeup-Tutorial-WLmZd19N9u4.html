tutorial on the look I am wearing right
now and say very fun glittery blue eye I
think it's perfect for New Year's Eve I
actually wore this look in Las Vegas one
night when we went out I wore this exact
look and I remember thinking oh my gosh
this would be perfect for New Year's Eve
and I always film a New Year's Eve
makeup tutorial since I started my
channel so I thought I would recreate
the look I did for you guys I think two
years ago I posted a blue New Year's Eve
makeup tutorial but it wasn't like this
it didn't have any glitter I'm obsessed
with the way that the blue glitter looks
I think it looks so cool so fun for New
Year's Eve I am using pretty pricy
eyeshadows which I'm so so sorry it's
just I really wanted to recreate the
look I wore in Vegas but you could use
any deep blue you have at home I'm using
one from this Natasha - Nonna palette
which this palette is super pricey and I
just use this blue color use whatever
blue you have in your collection and I
also used the visor palette which is
very pricey as well but it's so so good
I'm obsessed with this palette I think
it's amazing the Sonia Kashuk eye on
neutral matte palette is very very
similar you could use that instead of
this if you have that palette just use
eyeshadows you have at home that are
similar and I struggled so much like oh
my gosh you could tell here my eyes are
so red I'm pretty sure my NYX modulae
eyeliners are expired
they're like done because as soon as I
put on my black eyeliner on my tight
line I got like crazy irritation my eyes
are burning right now they are on fire I
had to use a different black eyeliner
for my waterline and then when I used it
on this eye it just like would not stick
to my waterline
my eyes are so runny right now and so
red so it was a little bit of a struggle
a little bit of a struggle but I really
love this look I love how I turned out
and I think it's awesome for New Year's
so if you want to see how to create this
look then just keep watching
okay so I've already primed my eyelids
and now I'm jumping into the Milani
shadow eyes little chubby crayons
in the shade black ink and I'm applying
this to my entire lid and then I'm
blending it up with a brush I want to
create a nice black base to apply my
shadow on top and excuse my voice it
still has not come back yet it's like I
don't know I don't know what's happening
here
I don't know okay so I'm jumping into
the Natasha's and ona palette and I'm
only using this blue eyeshadow it's like
a really intense shimmery blue shade
really really pretty but use any blue
you have and I am just applying that to
my entire lid and then I'm taking a
crease brush and just blending out the
edges I'm not applying any eyeshadow to
that brush
I was just blending out the edges and
then I went into the Weiser palette and
I took that light cream shade to blend
into my crease going back into the
eyeshadow palette I'm taking this shade
right here and I'm taking another crease
brush and I'm just focusing this in the
crease this look looks a little sloppy
before it looks good it's just a lot a
lot of blending so I'm taking another
shade this one is more red toned and I'm
doing the exact same thing just blending
this into my crease making sure that the
blue is nice and blended and that there
are no harsh lines so that's exactly
what I'm doing
back and forth blending blending
blending so because of all the blending
you will lose some blue eyeshadow on
your lid so I'm just reapply that blue
making sure it stays nice and deep and
blue and I'm going back into this red
tone shade and doing the exact same
thing just really blending out the harsh
edges now I'm going into a deeper brown
color and I'm taking a much smaller
crease brush and I'm just focusing this
chocolate shade right in the crease I'm
not doing too much blending I just want
to mesh all the colors together and then
I'm highlighting underneath my brow bone
with that white shade and then I'm
cleaning up the look I created kind of
like a cat eye with the makeup remover
to create that like sharp edge you see
there and then I went in with the Urban
Decay heavy metal liner in the shade
spandex and I'm applying this to my
entire lid it's going to make it look
nice and glittery it looks wet at first
but once it
dries it looks really cool and glittery
I love it
then I take my English L liner in the
shade number 77 it's a matte black and
I'm using a tiny little angled brush to
create a nice wing and then I tight line
with my NYX treasure Li gel black liner
in pitch black although I think mine is
a little old not going to lie because it
totally irritated my eyes popped on some
Daisy falsies by the brand kiss and then
I moved on to my face this is the NYX
angel veil primer I'm just applying this
to my entire face and I went in with the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
foundation I'm in the shade at 1:20 and
I'm just applying this to my my entire
face with my Beauty Blender my nose is
stuffy as well like I cannot possibly
get sick again I was just sick my gosh
what's wrong with my immune system I
don't know I am just blending that in
and then for concealer is surprise
surprise I can't stop using this I'm
sorry this is the Tarte shape tape
concealer and usually I mix those two
shades but I decided I wanted a more
highlighted look underneath my eyes so
I'm just using the shade fair I'm
applying that underneath my eyes to
conceal my dark circles but also to
bring light to the center of my face so
I'm blending that in with my Beauty
Blender and then I'm going to apply some
more in the center of my face on my nose
on my forehead on my chin just so
everything evens out and everything it
matches
to set my concealer I'm going to take my
RC ma no color powder and I'm just going
to apply this to all the places I apply
to the concealer and then to contour
this is another product I can't stop
using I'm so sorry this is the Kevyn
Aucoin sculpting powder in the shade
light I'm sorry my eyes were irritating
me so bad that's why you see me like
blinking like crazy in this video my
eyes are on fire I'm obsessed with this
contour powder I can't stop using it I'm
sorry this is the jouer matte bronzer in
the shade sun tan it's a really really
beautiful bronzer I'm applying this
pretty much everywhere just to bring
warmth back into my skin and then
because it's an New Year's Eve look I
want my contour to look a little bit
more defined so I just apply to some of
that powder right underneath my contour
and then cleaned it up a little bit I
didn't bake or anything but you know I
just cleaned it up a bit for blush I
went in with the Wet n Wild color icon
blush in the shade rose champagne and
then to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones I'm taking the jcat triple
crown shadow in creme Brule I'm going to
take the tart tart es eyeliner for my
waterline since my NYX one wasn't doing
too hot so I just applied this to my
waterline and then I took the dark brown
shade in the visor palette and I'm using
a very tiny pencil brush to smudge this
dark brown eyeshadow on my lower lash
line and then I took a little bit of the
black as smudged it right on top to
highlight my inner corners I'm taking
the same highlight I used on my face and
then I'm going to go in with my benefit
roller lash and apply that to my bottom
lashes and then the eyes are completely
done really cool really glittery and
then to finish off the look I'm taking
the NARS Velvet lip glide and the shade
stripped and then that completes this
look thank you guys so much for watching
