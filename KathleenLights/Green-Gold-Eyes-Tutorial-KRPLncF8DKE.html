tutorial today on the eye makeup I'm
wearing right now it is a green smokey
eye but they're olive tones like they
have some gold in them because I never
wear green eyeshadow
I just don't think green eyeshadow looks
good on me I feel like it clashes with
my eye color I don't know but I did want
to do a green and Goldy kind of eye look
for those of you who do like to wear
green eyeshadow so this is the look I
came up with I am using two different
palettes in this tutorial but you can
use colors that you have at home colors
that are similar to the ones I'm using
and the colors I'm using are from the
natural and night palette from Too Faced
and the Naked palette from Urban Decay I
know a lot of people have this but I'm
just using the greens that are in this
palette actually liked how it turned out
not necessarily on me but I think this
would look so beautiful if you have
brown eyes so definitely try it out I do
show you the rest of my face like my
foundation my concealer and all that
stuff because I haven't been showing
that in the last couple videos I did
keep it very fresh and natural on the
rest of my face it's kind of the look I
was going for so yeah if you want to see
how to get this look then just keep
watching okay so like always I'm going
to start by priming my eyes and I'm
using Mac's painterly paint-pot
to do this
now I'm taking my naked palette and I'm
using the color naked and I'm going to
use this as my transition color in the
crease you can just take any light brown
color
now I'm taking my Too Faced natural at
night palette and I'm going to be using
this color right here called moonstone
it is a really pretty Goldy kind of
green it's so nice and I'm going to be
putting that on half of my eyelid on the
inner half
I'm taking that all the way up to the
crease but I'm not putting any on the
outer V right here now I'm going to be
taking this color right next to it
called Night Fever which is a deeper
green with gold glitter and this is
what's going to be going right on the
outer part of my eye again I'm still a
little sick so I still sound a little
recipe forgive me I don't know when I'm
going to get rid of this cold now I'm
going back into the Naked palette and
I'm getting the color right here called
buck and I'm taking that on a fluffy
little crease brush and I'm just going
to blend out the colors in my crease
okay so after I've done that I'm going
back into my natural and night palette
and I'm going to go back into these
colors right here and do the exact same
thing I did first only I'm going to be
adding fix+ to my brush and this is just
going to intensify the color a lot more
okay so next I'm going to be taking my
217 and I'm going in with this color in
the natural night palette and it is
called cocoa star like a really pretty
brown I don't explain it but it's really
nice and I'm just going to be taking
this into the outer V right here and
then bringing it into the crease
I'm bringing that a little bit above my
crease as well
then just taking a fluffy brush like
this dipping it into that naked color
and just kind of blending that out a
little bit more by the way I added
virgin as my brow bone highlight I don't
know why I did that off camera now I'm
just going to add some eyeliner I'm
using the Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in Midnight master which is
just a black and I'm going to tightline
with this and add it to my waterline for
my lower lash line I'm going to be
taking the brown in the natural at night
palette here and I'm going to be putting
that on the outer part of my lower lash
line this guy just turned black because
it knew I was filming but I know I say
sorry in every video so I'm not gonna do
it this time but just know the side turn
black of course of course I know I keep
going back and forth between these two
palettes but what can you do I'm going
to take half baked from The Naked
palette and I'm going to add that right
here where this gold is but I'm going to
add fix+ to the brush just to intensify
it make it a lot more vibrant and gold
I'm going to take spotlight right here
and this is going to be my highlight
right in here okay so now I'm just going
to add some mascara and you can go ahead
and add some wing liner to this look if
you want but I like how it looks just
like this my mascara that I'm using is
my Jordana best lash extreme I'm using
this on my top lashes and then for my
bottom lashes i'm using the it's so big
volumizing mascara I got this in an Ipsy
bag and it actually works pretty well on
my bottom lashes it makes them super
long so that's what I'm going to do
right now okay so these are the finished
eyes if you want to see what is going to
go on the rest of my face then just keep
watching okay so I already filled in my
eyebrows I'm really not a fan of how I
am green eyeshadow looks on me I don't
know I feel like it just doesn't look
good with my eye color anyway
the primer I'm using today is my L'Oreal
magic Lumi I said never use this as a
primer and now I use it all the time it
just makes my skin feel so nice the
foundation I'm going to be using today
is the Maybelline fit me concealer I
have been using this as foundation and
gotta say I love it as foundation I
really wish that the fit me foundation
had the same creaminess and consistency
as the concealer does because honestly
this is foundation to me it's not thick
it's not cakey and it doesn't make my
dry skin look dry
and it has the coverage because it's a
concealer it's awesome of course I use a
crap ton of product so I waste this
pretty easily but I like it I'm going to
be using my Beauty Blender
for my under eyes I'm using my
Maybelline instant age rewind dark
circle eraser crank this up
for underneath my eyes I'm using my
mineralize skinfinish natural as I
always do because it's the bomb diggity
for my bronzer I'm using the Sonia
Kashuk warm bronzer
I mean cream bronzer in warm tan just
look like this and I use that with a
real techniques buffing brush I like
this because it gives a very subtle
bronze maybe I should have left my hair
up
ah look
see it's not too pigmented where it
looks a little scary it just kind of
looks like a natural bronze glow to your
face I really love that poor blush I'm
using Mac's Melba it is a matte peachy
kind of blush
I'm keeping it pretty simple on my lips
I'm just using the NYX butter gloss and
creme brulee
okay guys that's it I wanted to do a
pretty sultry eye look and then keep it
pretty natural and fresh on the rest of
my face so I hope you liked this
