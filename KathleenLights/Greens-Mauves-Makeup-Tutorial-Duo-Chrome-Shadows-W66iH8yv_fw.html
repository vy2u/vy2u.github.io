a makeup tutorial on this look it's
using the makeup geek dual chrome eyes
shadows I'm a little sick if you can
tell in my voice but if you want to see
how to get this look then just keep
watching I'm going to start off with
this color pop eyeshadow I'm pretty sure
this one is called Central Perk but if
it's not I will have the correct name
down below in the description box but
I'm just buffing this into my crease I'm
kind of using this shade as a transition
treat just so everything blends nicely
then I'm going to take this color this
is my all-over lid shade and this is in
the shade Havok and I'm just applying
this to my entire lid then I'm gonna
spray some fix+ on my brush and just go
over with the same eyeshadow just to
intensify it a little bit more wetting
it really brings out the dual Kronus
this is an eyeshadow by morphe and it's
just a straight-up orange matte
eyeshadow so I applied that in the
crease then I took another morphe
eyeshadow in the shade
in and just pretty much did the exact
same thing
this is Steampunk by makeup geek it's
another duochrome eyeshadow and I'm
applying this really concentrated like
in the crease and the outer corner and
I'm not really buffing that out much
then I'm going to take havoc again and
apply that to my entire lid once again
just in case anything got blended away
this is um voltage another duochrome eye
shadow by makeup geek I applied that
underneath my brow bone but I didn't
want it too intense so I just went over
it with makeup geek wipes lives now I'm
going to take the eyeshadow called karma
also by makeup geek and I'm applying
this right in the inner corners of my
eyelid I'm concentrating that a little
bit on the eyelid and then bringing it
into the inner tear-duct as well
so I'm gonna start on my face before I
finish my eyes I'm just moisturizing my
skin with C provides skin milk this is
just a moisturizer I got in my boxycharm
so I'm playing into my skin and then I'm
going to prime with my maybelline baby
skin instant pore eraser the foundation
I'll be using is they make fervor HD
stick I'm going to shade the 140 no no
no 118
I'll have the shade name down below I'm
like really sick at this point again I
don't know how I got sick again the
seasons the changes I don't know what's
happening but I'm just buffing that
foundation into my skin and then I'm
going to conceal my under eyes and
highlight other parts of my face as well
this is the bare minerals bare skin
concealer I love this concealer so much
I'm buffing this out with a Real
Techniques contour brush and it just
blends so beautifully it's really
amazing amazing love this consider
so because this concealer kind of has a
natural almost dewy finish to the skin I
want to make sure that I set all the
areas where I applied that concealer so
I'm putting this in between my eyebrows
all that good stuff especially
underneath my eyes make sure nothing
creases and everything is nice and set
okay so let's quickly finish off the eye
I'm going to take more faith deep skin
one more time and I'm gonna get out of
the frame because I'm a horrible
horrible youtuber but basically with a
pencil brush I'm just buffing this on my
lower lashline and then I didn't even
show you what I was using because I'm a
terrible person
I just did a normal wing to my eye using
Kat Von D's dark brown liquid eyeliner
and I was out of the frame the entire
time so it was really pointless footage
but I applied a steampunk on the outer
portion of my lower lashes and then I
picked up karma again and applied that
to my inner corners just to really
brighten that area and then applied some
to the lower lashes as well then I
applied some mascara and I went in with
some falsies these are the morphe whispy
falsies so I did all that jazz and now
our eyeballs are done so to finish off
my face I'm going to contour using the
L'Oreal True Match powder to contour
with this is in the shade c8 cocoa I
believe that's what the name is and I
love this powder to contour it's so
blendable because it's a face powder I
really love it so I'm just contouring my
face now I'm applying blush this is
milania's rose de Oro it's their baked
blush I love how it looks with this eye
look it's such a pretty Rosie's warm
shade and then I'm going to go ahead and
just do my lips to complete the look
this is the Too Faced lip liner in the
shade perfect spice and I just filled my
entire lips with that
and then I went over it with the NYX
suede that lipstick in the shade and
storm and then that completes this look
I really hope you guys enjoyed thank you

in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
