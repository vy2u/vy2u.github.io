tutorial on this look it's just a really
glittery dark gray gunmetal smokey eye
I'm using the gunmetal stack by melt
cosmetics I love their stacks I have all
of them they are so good they are very
very pricey but I feel like melt
cosmetics they're so innovative they're
still edgy I love melt as a brand I will
say if you are working with the gunmetal
stack specifically you need to do your
eye shadow before you do the rest of
your face makeup the last two shades in
the stack these two right here this one
is industrial and this one is gunmetal
they have a lot of Fallout a lot of
Fallout even the top shade there's only
one matte shade in the stack this one
has a lot of Fallout as well so you want
to make sure you are doing your eyes
first I did my eyes first and even I
have some fallout on my face you have to
be very careful with these I don't have
that problem with the other stacks it's
just this one specifically since they're
kind of like pressed glitters their
eyeshadows but they're very glittery in
a friend willing if you want to see how
to get this smoky eye then just keep
watching okay so I'm going to jump into
eye shadow because I already primed my
lids my lids are good to go and I'm
gonna take the shade assimilate from the
melt cosmetics gunmetal stack and I'm
using a fluffy brush and I'm just
applying this into my crease and then
I'm going to take my NYX glitter primer
and with my finger I'm gonna apply this
to my entire lid I'm not passing the
crease but I'm doing this because I went
in with the shade gunmetal which is this
shade right here and if I don't go in
with a sticky base or like a glitter
primer underneath there won't be much
pigment like it'll just be little
glitters so adding the glitter primer
really intensifies the eyeshadow now I'm
going back in to assimilate on a smaller
little crease brush and I'm really just
buffing out this gunmetal shade I will
say it is a little bit difficult to work
with just because this is a matte and
we're trying to blend out a glitter it's
kind of difficult but I did take my time
with this I'm just going back and forth
with the shade a similar
and blending up those edges I thought
the look needed just a hair of warmth so
on a fluffy brush I took my Physicians
Formula butter bronzer and I just
blended out the edges of the shade
assimilate just so everything looks like
a nice gradient to highlight underneath
my brow bone I'm actually taking this
makeup forever m500 shade and putting
that underneath my brow bone like I said
to highlight then I went back in to
assimilate on two different brushes and
I'm just buffing out those edges it's
just a lot of blending in the crease and
since we did so much blending a lot of
the glitter fell off so I went back in
with gunmetal and just applied that to
my lids and then I'm jumping into the
face before I finish up the eyes this is
a primer from the Brandt and money it's
their perfect 10 primer serum and I'm
just testing that out right now and I'm
also trying this primer out for the
first time in this video this is the it
cosmetics by by a porous primer and so
far so good it really did smooth out the
skin I'm still testing it out but I
think I really like it
for foundation I went with I went in
with the Loreal Pro glow foundation this
is in the shade tool 3 I believe and it
just the undertone isn't right it
doesn't match my skin perfectly but the
formula is pretty good it gives your
skin a natural finish for concealer I'm
going in with my favorite this is the
Tarte shape tape concealer this is in
the shade fair and I'm just highlighting
my face and also covering up my dark
circles and just blending of that in
with a sponge to set my concealer I'm
using the NYC smooth skin loose
translucent setting powder and just I'm
just setting all the places I applied
the concealer because I don't feel like
this foundation needs to be set the mat
comes sailor dude so to finish off the
eyes I'm taking a black eyeliner on my
waterline and on my tight line this is
the essence smoky black Kajal fat chubby
you know one of those Kajal things it's
really good and so affordable but for my
lower lash line I am just taking the
shade assimilate and really blending
that out and then I went into this wet
and wild trio called plaid to the bone
and I took the blue
color in the trio and I'm blending this
right on top of the assimilation shade
to create kind of like a bluegray color
and then I just blended that out and
then I took some more of the NYX glitter
primer and I'm applying that to my inner
corner so that I can go over it with
this shade this one is called harsh
stone white and with a little blush no a
little brush I'm applying that to my
inner corners and dragging it on to my
lid as well then I just applied some
mascara and I popped on some falsies I
use the Coco falsies in the shade Misha
and that completes the I look for
contouring I am using the Kevyn Aucoin
sculpting powder in the shade light just
to give myself a little bit of conto and
then I took the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer on a bigger fluffier
brush to really just bronze up the skin
then for blush I took the Milani Rose
blush in the shade awakening rose and I
pop that on my cheeks I love this blush
I bought mine on Amazon because I
couldn't seem to find it anywhere I
think it was limited edition but it's
beautiful if you can find it get it and
then to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones and my nose and all that good
stuff
I took the Becca champagne pop highlight
and just put in that everywhere as usual
for lips I wanted a peachy color but I
didn't think it was gonna be a speech as
this turned out this is the Kylie liquid
lipstick in the shade but it was a
little bit too neon for me like it was a
little bit unexpected I was like whoa
that's peach so I decided to take a nude
gloss on top and I applied the dose of
colors gloss in the shade undressed and
then that completes this look thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
