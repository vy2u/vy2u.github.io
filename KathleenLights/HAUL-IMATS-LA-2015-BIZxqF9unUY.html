my IMATS haul I threw everything in this
Anastasia bag because I thought this bag
was so pretty I'm gonna be sharing with
you everything I got a IMATS
and I'm not gonna lie like I like I shop
at IMATS
I know you guys wanted to see um the
other haul I asked you guys if you
wanted to see both the IMATS haul and
stuff I got at Sephora while I was in
California and other places like when I
shopped in California so I will be
posting that haul as well but today is
the IMATS haul and for those of you who
don't know I was at IMATS this past
weekend well not this week the 16th and
the 17th I believe I was at IMATS it's
the International makeup artist Street
tradeshow I believe this was it stands
for but basically a bunch of brands are
there selling their products and brands
I didn't even know about and a lot of it
is discounted not everything but a lot
of it you get a discount on so I'm gonna
be sharing with you the stuff that I got
I love this babe he's good okay so I'm
not gonna go in any order I'm just gonna
pull things out and share with you so I
picked up model in a bottle this is a
makeup setting spray I have heard of
this for years on YouTube I've been
watching YouTube since like 2008 and I
have heard about this product for years
um but they change the bottle and they
actually have two different formulas now
so I got the sensitive skin formula
because obviously I have sensitive skin
and I'm kind of like scared of you know
stuff so this is it says it's a matte
finish and I heard that this is like
hairspray for your face that your makeup
won't go anywhere like legit like the
craziest settings forever so I bought
this for special occasions like my
birthday is on Tuesday I don't know when
you'll be watching this video but my
birthday is January 27th so I want to
wear this out on my birthday see how it
lasts so um I have heard Koko lashes
from lustre looks like she talks about
Koko lashes all the time and the
packaging and everything reminds me of
House of lashes so they had a lady Moss
booth
maths and they were selling like la
girls Koko lashes and a bunch of other
stuff I think lady mass comm is an
actual website and I've heard lustre Lux
talk about that website that this is
where she gets her Koko lashes so I was
crazy I was like as soon as I got
timeouts i was like i'm looking for Koko
lashes I want to buy some so they had
lashes like this they have like a really
thin band and these were five for $14 I
believe which is a really good deal
house of lashes cost about $9 each I buy
my own house of lashes lashes and
they're worse at their expense about
their with it and then they had ones
like these which I don't know if you
could tell the difference like this is
like crazy intense and these were like
four for 19 so I did both and I got nine
pairs of lashes which is crazy because I
don't really wear lashes all that much
but I love fall classes I don't know my
problem is but yeah I got these 108 I
got the 101 I got the 201 not that you
can see them but I got the two oh ones
um
and the 107 these are like their basic
like nice natural lashes and then these
are the ones that I was really excited
for I got four of like they're on a 5 5
of their intense ones so this one is in
the style Coco they're really cool I
don't want this video to be too long so
I'm not gonna really do close-ups but I
got the style Coco I got oh another one
oh one okay what yeah I got these these
are crazy these are in the shade in the
style foxy in the shade I got these in
Bella and then I was really excited for
these I want to see how these compared
to my house of lashes ones this is in
the style Nisha
these are identical like they look
identical to my favorite lashes from
House of lashes in the style Bambi so I
want to see how they compare
so mama went a little crazy at the lash
booth but that's okay so I saw that del
iam Tools was gonna be there and I've
heard a lot of good things about this
brand their brushes and they're really
really inexpensive really inexpensive
brushes under yellow which I think
that's so cool if you guys didn't know
my second favorite color of all time
that's my second favorite color of all
time red is my favorite color
and then I really love yellow like
McDonald so I got this one this is just
their tapered blending kind of like a a
sigma e40 I got to see how it compares I
don't know maybe like a Sigma e-40 I'm
not exactly sure this is what it looks
like the hairs I was first time in me
feeling them the hair is feel really
soft I could work with this I can work
with this oh my god and you're so cute
this was five dollars guys Dehlia moles
five dollars and I will link any of
these websites down below I know Delia
moules has a website so I will link it
down below in case you're interested
because they're so inexpensive I also
picked up this one this is the one that
I'm really excited for this is the 776
blending brush this I think is like a
dupe for the Mac 217 which is my fully
grown shadow brush this was only five
dollars
mmm I have to wash it and like fluff it
up more and stuff and get it nice and
like used but yeah that's like a nice
more precise blending brush not that I
need more brushes this one is the 944
tapered contour this one was nine
dollars which is still really
inexpensive for a face brush this is
what it looks like you know like - dude
- dude - dude really cute and it's a
crazy and then this one I wanted to see
how I compared to my zoeva brush that I
love so much it's super dirty over there
that's like a tapered like a giant
tapered brush this was $11 and it's a
974 tapered powder and this is what it
looks like $11 is so cheap for a brush
like this oh my god I love it already
see I got these for kind of regretting
not getting more I was gonna get Haku
photo brushes they're really really
expensive brushes but I've heard crazy
good things about Haku hoto but I
decided to do a sheep and get my lab
tools and said Delian tools instead
I keep calling it valium oh right it
so nannies was there which I was so
excited when I found out that name is
who is going to be their name ease is
like a store that has a bunch of
high-end makeup and if you have like a
pro card you could shop online or at the
store they only have a store in
California so you can shop at their
store shop online and get crazy
discounts on like high-end brands so
Namie's was the IMATS and everybody got
to shop the discount so everything was
40% off that is a huge that's almost
half off 40% off of high-end makeup like
really good stuff so to face was there
you guys know that Too Faced is my
ultimate favorite high-end brand they
are literally my favorite brand in the
entire world so I had never tried these
melted lipsticks from Too Faced before
you know and normally when you've never
tried something before you buy one right
to try it
no it was 40% off these things are
normally $21 and I got them for 12 okay
so I didn't only get one
I got a left I got this one this is
melted nude
I got melted marshmallow I got melted
Chihuahua that's my favorite name
I got melted Chihuahua melted velvet oh
my god I have an addiction I got this
one this one's so pretty this is melted
sugar and then I got melted strawberry
but actually I didn't get this one at
Namie's I got this one at Sephora
yesterday so that doesn't count but I
got melted strawberry just in case you
guys are interested so I picked up these
at Namie's and I know that's crazy but
they were almost half off so I decided
to just take the plunge because to face
has never disappointed me
well that one time with the semi-sweet
chocolate bar so yeah if you guys saw my
video where I was talking about my la
experience I asked you guys if you
wanted to see lip swatch week so I might
include this in lip swatch week so oh
yeah these are just like liquid
lipsticks but they feel a little bit
more like soft and velvety and then
got another of their two-faced like
creme lipsticks I love these like creme
lipsticks like so much and I got spice
spice baby just kind of like a sheer
lipstick like it's a little bit more
sheer but it's kind of like a Mavi you
know like this kind of color and I'm
really really into these kinds of colors
I used to think that these kind of
colors looked really bad on me but I
really a I'm sorry that I'm not doing
like real intense close-ups I'm trying
to speed this up because my videos are
way too long and I'm trying to kind of
shorten them down a little bit that's my
New Year's resolution is to make my
videos shorter because who wants to sit
through 20 minutes of me nobody okay so
we're still sticking with Namie's right
now I picked up another Beauty Blender
because it's 40% off and why not these
are like $20 so I took advantage of the
discount and they didn't have the red
ones I wanted a red one so bad because I
feel like they just came out with red
ones I saw them at Sephora but they
didn't have them so okay so Laura
Mercier was at Navis and I love Laura
Mercier actually don't own anything from
Laura Mercier but my makeup bag is from
Laura Mercier and I love it so I decided
to take advantage of all the Laura
Mercier products I've always wanted to
try so I got four things I got this and
honestly I kind of regret buying this
sort of this is the secret brightening
powder and this is just like a kind of
like translucent powder but it's very
brightening like for under the eye and I
love a bright under eye but I hate loose
powders it's just that I've heard Dana
like talk about this and she really
likes it I'd still regret it I feel like
I'm not going to reach for this all that
much it's not I'm gonna go return it to
Namie's cuz that's in California but let
me know if you've tried this and you
really like it let me know I got this
this is the foundation primer I have
this one that I take with me when I
travel all the time this is the Laura
Mercier primer but this is their regular
primer but I got this one in radiance
because you guys know I have really dry
skin
I decided to get one that has kind of
like a sheen to like apply to my whole
face and stuff I have kind of been like
a primer binge like I'm obsessed with
primers now I don't know why but I
Goldie I got the silk cream foundation
which I've heard really good things
about but my Sephora doesn't carry laura
mercier so i could never pick out a good
shade online and you know that's tricky
so I got this one but I color matched
myself to the color I was at I'm at and
I was like self tan so I got this one in
bamboo beige this is definitely my
self-tanning shade cream ivory is my not
tan shade but they didn't have it it was
out of stock so I'm gonna have to go
online and get Korea ivory but it's also
out of stock online at Sephora so I got
this foundation I hope I like it my skin
is really dry so I don't know not that I
needed more foundation no I really
didn't but I know for a video or review
something I did and then the last Laura
Mercier thing I got was this this is
what I was most excited for this is the
matte radiance baked powder I don't know
why I say it's matte because it's not
matte there's no glitter in it but it's
not matte it's a beautiful highlight
which she goes no it's my flavoring I
can't get enough of highlights look at
it oh my gosh this is so beautiful it
has like such an incredible Sheen but
it's a true sheen no glitter enos
nothing it's like a true sheen which is
what I like I really I'm really excited
for that okay and then the last thing I
got while I was at Namie's is this this
is a bobbi brown shimmer brick which I'm
kind of upset that I got this sort of
because the day before I'm at I went to
Macy's in California and I bought my
very first shimmer brick and I was so
excited and these things are expensive
there are 44 bucks I believe and I never
wanted to buy them because
that was like well I have my shimmer
strips from Physicians Formula which are
like the same thing which they really
are they really aren't kind of like the
same thing I would go for the Physicians
Formula One's but I bought when I may
seize the day before and the next day
when I went I'm at I saw that they had
Bobby Brown 40% off and I was like I got
this one in bronze and I know that this
is way too dark for me to be a highlight
this is like a legit bronzer but I got
it to use like in the summer to add like
a golden glow to my cheeks in the summer
like in the dead of summer I'm moving
back to Florida soon and I need
something like this and then that's
everything I got at Macy's at Namie's
and then I went to a violet vols I've
heard really good things about violet
balls and I just picked up a pigment I
didn't get any of their glitters because
I recently put a purchase on lit
cosmetics calm and I got some glitters
from lit cosmetics and then I got some
glitters again so I just got a pigment I
got this one because she told me that it
was like the number one seller that day
and it's called beachy keen it's a
really I can't even this it's a really
pretty like peachy shimmery something
that I definitely would wear it's just
like a really nice I got that pigment
and then I got this every time I tried
to order this off of house app order
every time I try to order this off of
house of lashes calm I was always out of
stock so it's pretty much just a little
cute case that you keep your eyelash
these are the eyelashes at work I wore
in California so I just kept them in
this I think is so cute to just like
then I walked by Scandinavia and I
wanted to get the setting spray but I
was like don't be overboard you just got
model in a bottle so I picked up this
and said this is the makeup primer spray
which I've never heard of this before
and I hear all the time that Scandinavia
is like top of the line for setting
sprays I know they make urban decay ones
but I always hear that Scandinavia alone
is better so I get they make a primer
spray it's kind of gay
to me I think but it says it has like
vitamins and it's good for makeup
application so I'll check it out and
then I stopped at the anastasia booth
and i picked up two of their matte
liquid lipsticks online the other day so
i have so i already have two of them but
then i bought four more
I'm definitely going to include the
including these and lip swatch week
because I have like a couple things to
say I love them but there are some
things about them that I don't like so I
will talk about them but I bought four
more I got pure Hollywood which this one
I have been dying for it's a really
pretty pink but has beige like a beige
undertone perfect for everyday so I got
that one I got this one in lovely this
one is like the perfect everyday pink
it's not too dark not too bright like a
nice mid-tone color um I got party girl
which is no party pink which is the one
I'm wearing on my lips right now really
fun like bright reminds me of mac candy
yum yum really nice and then I got vamp
I asked nor VI mentor vena which is kind
of exciting Porter Porter was really
exciting to meet nor Vina she is like
beautiful she is literally like Jaclyn
hill but with blue hair it's kind of
strange but she is so gorgeous so I
asked her I was like I really want one
that is red but it has like a brown
undertone so she recommended a vamp
so this one is vamp it's a nice brown
red umm yes beautiful and then I picked
up two more brow iza's in dark brown
formerly known as brunette because all
of their brow products were 40% off
nothing nothing but their brow products
were 40% off and I was like oh yeah
totally
I just bought a bra with but I was like
I'll buy two more because I go through
these like water and for 40% off girl
you can't beat that
okay I'm sorry this video is so long
they're almost done I thought that this
booth called eye candy I believe that's
the name of the brand and it's basically
glitters this is exactly like lit
cosmetics so you get this liquid right
here and it kind of works as like
a mixing medium sort of dip it into the
mixing medium and then dip it into the
glitter and it pretty much turns it into
glitter eyeliner basically so it's
really cool so I got this glitter in
raspberry blast which is a really cool
intense like red color I thought it
would be really nice for us to toriel
maybe maybe you know then I got this one
that doesn't have a name awesome and
then I got this one ah that doesn't have
a name beautiful thank you eye candy and
then I stopped by this booth that was
called hot makeup because I forgot to
tell me but somebody told me that they
had like liquid lipsticks that were
dupes for the Anastasia ones which you
guys know I'm like on a liquid lipstick
binge and I was gonna buy through them
and then I thought that I saw that there
were seventeen dollars and I was like
that's them that's not a huge dupe
that's like only like three dollars
cheaper than the Anastasia ones and I
don't exactly know if these are any good
the brand is hot makeup and they're
called kiss me more lip creams and I got
this really pretty lavender in the shade
moonlight glow because I don't have
anything like this it's really pretty
packaging I want to see how this works
I kind of like a soft shimmer I don't
know I'm hoping that this is good we
shall see and then there was an English
got like the infamous Inglot gel liner
number 77 and not that I need any gel
eyeliners because I like to open one at
a time so right now I'm using my la girl
one but this is like famous and yeah so
I got the Inglot black gel eyeliner
people rave about it
and then the last thing I got I stopped
at the dose of colors booth and I got
two products I got one of their liquid
matte lipsticks as if I need more but I
got this one in bury me I love the
packaging it's so pretty
it's like a really nice purple raspberry
color and then I got one of their this
is their okay this is their lip gloss in
the color under dressed and this is just
a really pretty peachy baiji peachy
color so yeah I got that I don't know
how good these are but I will give it a
go okay so that is everything I got at
IMATS I actually scored some pretty good
deals on these things and it was a lot
of fun thank you to everyone who came up
