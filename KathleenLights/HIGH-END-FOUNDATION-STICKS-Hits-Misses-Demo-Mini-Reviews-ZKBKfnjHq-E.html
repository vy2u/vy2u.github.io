another battle of the foundation sticks
video and today we are tackling high end
foundations I recently posted a video
just like this but all about drugstore
foundation 6 so if you haven't seen that
I will link it down below today is part
2 we are talking about high end
foundation sticks and I have 7 to share
with you guys today which is a lot I
don't want this video to be too long so
I'm gonna try to bring through them but
I bet you this video is more than 20
minutes
check-check about you it's more than 20
minutes I'm going to be comparing all
seven of these foundation sticks to one
another I'm going to tell you guys my
thoughts mini reviews on each one and
just like my drugstore video I'm going
to be including demos of me applying
each foundation just so that you can see
how it looks on the skin I noticed when
I was editing my drugstore one that they
all looked pretty good on camera when I
applied it which I thought was so funny
because they were all so different and
they performed so differently same goes
for these foundations I haven't looked
back at the footage since I haven't
started editing it but my reviews are
not based on how it looks initially it's
about how the foundation wears how it
looks throughout the day how it feels on
the skin so just keep that in mind okay
I'm gonna get started I'm not gonna go
in any specific order I'm just going to
grab them and show them to you I've kind
of placed them in order from like matte
to Dewey but there's similar ones in
between uh I'm just going to show you
okay so first up we have the Anastasia
Beverly Hills foundation stick I am in
the shade beige and I love the fact that
Anastacio has so many colors the color
range is amazing
they have a ton of shades in the range
you will definitely be able to find a
color for your skin this one is also the
cheapest out of all of the ones I'm
gonna be talking about some of these
have a pretty high price tag this one is
only $25 which isn't necessarily dirt
cheap or anything but for it being a
high-end brand I think that's an amazing
price I will say that this color beige
on the sephora website is labeled as
light-skinned with neutral undertones
but I don't think it's very neutral I
think it's pretty yellow in my opinion
even though there are a lot of shade
selections I feel like the descriptions
are kind of misleading on a lot of the
shades she also has
good highlighting and contouring colors
so you can contour highlight and apply
our foundation within the range this is
nice I don't love it but I don't hate it
either honestly after hearing so many
people talk about it I thought that I
was going to hate it I didn't think it
was gonna work for me at all because I
hear everyone with oily skin raving
about it and then everyone with dry skin
not loving it so much so I thought for
sure that I was going to hate it but
surprisingly I don't it's not as drying
as I thought it was going to be now keep
in mind I am wearing a primer underneath
all of these foundations I'm using my
glossy a priming moisturizer it's the
same primer I use in my drugstore
foundation stick video so that really
did help moisturize my skin before
applying this foundation it has a matte
finish but surprisingly it is pretty
natural
if you don't moisturize though it will
cling on to the dry skin but I would
definitely recommend it for those of you
with normal to oily skin one thing I
really like about this that it's not
tacky to the touch
obviously most matte foundations aren't
tacky but it's nice because you don't
really need to set it one weird thing
about this foundation though is that it
doesn't really apply on my nose it's
like the weirdest thing I have a very
dry nose maybe that's why it doesn't
really apply well but I will try to put
this on my nose and it's like it doesn't
stick to the nose weirdest thing ever it
does last a pretty long time on the skin
though like I will be on my face for a
lot of hours but it starts to break up
and get really weird around my nose
first in my opinion I think it applies
way better with a brush versus a Beauty
Blender you get more coverage with a
brush and it has medium coverage you can
build this up but not so much if you
have dry skin it's not very buildable I
find that it looks even drier the more I
try to apply it so yeah it is pretty
good and I really like the price it's
just for my skin type it's not the best
next up we have the Lancome teint Idole
ultra wear makeup stick it has an SPF of
21 and I am in the shade 250 bisque W I
don't think it's very warm it says it's
warm but I would say this is more of a
neutral undertone there is a bisque
color that's labeled as n like labeled
as neutral but it's not neutral my
opinion it's like pink so just keep that
in mind this one is a little bit pricier
this retails for $42
and I completely forgot to tell you guys
how many Ounces were in the foundation
sticks at the drugstore like in that
video I forgot to tell you how much
product you get in each foundation such
a brain fart and I totally forgot to do
that again today but I'm gonna do it so
this one is 25 bucks the anastacio one
and you get point 32 ounces stick
foundations though I didn't know this a
couple months ago but stick foundations
typically have less product in it
because they're higher in pigment or lid
there like solidified you know since
they are solid I don't know the science
behind it they just normally have less
product this one is 42 bucks in it is
point 31 ounces this one is actually
pretty freakin good I would say it has a
soft matte kind of like a satin finish
it's not as mad as the anastacio one
it's a little bit more natural I would
say those of you with dry skin can get
away with using this one but I think it
would also work really well for oily
skin I love that it's not tacky to the
touch at all so you don't have to set it
but I definitely 100% prefer it more
with the Beauty Blender believe it or
not I noticed that every time I try to
apply this foundation with a brush it
just emphasizes my pores at least when
I'm using a moisturizing primer
underneath like the one I used in the
demo I definitely prefer a Beauty
Blender but if I'm using a pore
minimizing primer then yes I like it
with a brush I'm not so sure you can
tell on camera but in person you can
definitely see my pores a lot more on
the side where I use the brush versus on
the side or I used a Beauty Blender but
I don't have that issue if I use a pore
filling primer I would say this has a
medium to full coverage on my skin I
noticed it getting a little bit cakey
when I tried to build it up too much so
I would just apply as much as I can at
once instead of trying to build up on
top of what I already put down because
it starts to look a little bit cakey but
I like to finish and it lasts a really
really long time on my skin they're not
kidding when they say ultra where I
think it it is it's ultra wearing next
up is definitely my favorite out of all
the foundations thick's I'm just going
to straight-up tell you right now this
one is my favorite
I thought the makeup for everyone was my
favorite but this one has taken its
place this is the hourglass vanish
foundation stick this also has a ton of
colors in the range if there's one thing
that's
lacking in the drugstore in terms of
their foundation stick is colors as you
guys know we talked about it in that
video they're color selection
not-so-good high-end brands definitely
have more shades to choose from the
hourglass one has a ton of different
shades I'm in the shade bisque I have
this foundation in like five different
colors this is when I'm the fairest as I
am right now it's the foundation I'm
wearing and I am as fair as I can get
this one retails for forty six dollars
so even pricier than the last one and
you get point twenty five ounces which
is even less than the last one so far
this is the one that has the least
amount of product which totally sucks
because compared to its price it is a
pricey foundation stick but I love it so
much the finish is so beautiful and what
I love most about it is that it's
extremely full coverage but it feels
very lightweight I didn't feel the need
to apply two layers in the demo I love
this foundation with a brush I
definitely prefer with a brush over a
Beauty Blender because the coverage
stays there like I noticed when I use a
brush I get full full coverage but it's
not sticky it's not greasy it's not
cakey at all it doesn't look thick on
the skin but it covers so much and I
love that it's a natural finish it's not
too dewy it's not too matte it's like
the perfect finish but it's not tacky at
all I didn't set my foundation today I
don't always set it sometimes I will
sometimes I won't and in my personal
opinion I do think it's worth the high
price tag next up is the Bobbi Brown
Skin Foundation stick this one is the
same price as the hourglass one so it's
$46 but you do get more product than the
hourglass you have point 31 ounces in
this one I'm in the shade warm ivory and
this is this one super light and even
though you get more product in this one
I don't love it as much as my hourglass
one I can't lie but I still think it is
a good foundation this one I definitely
prefer with a Beauty Blender I find that
when I try to apply it with a brush I
just have to sit there and really really
buff it into the skin like it takes
longer to sink into the skin with a
brush versus a Beauty Blender I guess
because the Beauty Blender really just
like bounces it into the skin it just
doesn't look as good with a brush this
is just one of those foundations
that look better when you take your time
and really push it into the skin but I
do think it has a very beautiful natural
finish not to man not to Dewey the only
weird thing about this foundation is it
transfers on my clothes so easily which
is so weird because it's not like
extremely tacky on the skin and it lasts
a good time on the skin like it's not
something that breaks up really easily
or that only lasts a couple of hours but
somehow it gets on my clothes really
easily like if I touch my face and I
haven't said it it'll get all over my
fingers if I put my phone to my face
like it will really really come off on
my phone which I find so incredibly
strange so my advice to you would be to
definitely set this one no matter what
skin type you have
I would definitely set it next up we
have the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
invisible cover stick foundation this
was my baby before I was introduced to
the hourglass one I'm in the shade Y
three to five which I think online is
called flesh side no I hate that word
flesh like that's such a weird word and
this retails for $43 and you get point
44 ounces so so far out of all of these
foundations this one has the most
product so when you do the math with the
money like it's not terrible I love this
one so much because it looks freaking
perfect in photos I think even more than
all the other ones it looks stunning in
flash photography it was like it was
made for flash photography and it has
full coverage but it doesn't look cakey
on the skin I love how much it covers
you don't have to do too many layers
with this just a little bit is enough to
cover what you need I apply a lot but
you don't need to and you get more
coverage if you do use a brush it does
look really pretty with a Beauty Blender
as well but I find that I like the
airbrushed look a brush gives it is a
little bit tacky to the touch I'm not
going to lie because it is more of a
dewy foundation not incredibly dewy but
there is a little bit of glow to it so
it is a little bit tacky but it's not
greasy either it's not like slippy or
slighty you just might want to set this
down sometimes I do sometimes I don't
definitely my second favorite out of the
bunch this next one was extremely
requested for me to try out after I did
my luxury makeup video and some of you
guys found out I was doing this like
foundation stick
a lot of you guys asked me to review
this thing this is the Tom Ford
traceless foundation stick so we got a
luxury a luxury makeup item in this
video I'm gonna shave 4.5 ivory this
foundation is $82.00 like that sinking
this is me finding you because you're
about to faint
I know $82 that's crazy like who would
spend that much on foundation I don't
know but that's how much it is but the
only thing I will say I will say is that
this is half an ounce
out of all the seven foundations in this
video this one has the most product in
it you get literally half an ounce so
that's always a good thing I mean it's
still way over price crazy seriously
insanely priced that's like double of
the it's crazy you can buy like 87
honest hacia ones or one of these like
it's insane I know but at least you get
more product this one I highly highly
highly suggest that you use a pore
minimizing primer this kind of
foundation doesn't really work well with
one of those creamy moisturizing and
hydrating kind of primers because it
really does emphasize the pores like
this will sink into your pores I would
say this has a good medium coverage but
it is definitely buildable this is a
pretty dewy foundation once it dries
down it does look a little bit less dewy
obviously it looks more dewy with a
Beauty Blender than it does with a brush
so if you're not into that like wet look
then definitely go with a brush on this
one but you put your fingers to your
face there is a tacky feeling almost
greasy like borderline greasy there's a
little bit slippy a little bit slighty
but when you have a full face of makeup
on this does look so beautiful and so
natural and dewy and fresh like it looks
gorgeous but it doesn't last that long
on the skin so I don't know that's
pretty much what I have to say about it
it's a nice finish it works really well
with my skin type like it looks
beautiful but I also don't think it's
worth the $80 I will not repurchase this
just because it's so much money and I
love my hourglass one way more I love to
make up forevers one way more like I
would pay 40 bucks for it for sure but a
tutu dance it Spence that's too
expensive okay and then last up we saved
my least favorite for last I don't like
this
one at home this is a foundation stick
from the brand wander beauty and this is
their flash focus hydrating foundation
stick I am in the shade light unlike all
the other foundations I spoke about
today the shade selection with this one
is not the best they only have five
shades at least on the Sephora website I
don't know if on the personal website
like on wander beauty calm or something
I don't know if they have more shades
but I'm Sephora there's only five and
that just doesn't cut it that's not
enough but anyway so it's labeled as a
hydrating foundation stick but let me
tell you hydrating is definitely an
understatement this is do we this is so
duly almost too dewy it has pretty good
reviews on the Sephora website but it
just did not work for me I would say
this would work for you if you have
extremely like chronic dry skin because
it has almost like an emollient texture
to it a little bit greasy like very very
tacky to the touch like this is
something you 1001 thousand million
percent you want to set it I would say
that it has a light coverage but you
could definitely build it up to full it
doesn't look cakey it just looks a
little bit too dewy for me it doesn't
cling on tiny dryness like I said it is
very very hydrating I mean there right
it's very hydrating it's just a little
bit too much for me I kind of feel like
I definitely feel it on the skin but I
mean that does go away once you said it
I don't hate it once I said it don't get
me wrong doesn't look bad it's just not
my favorite if I'm gonna be honest it
also doesn't last that long like it
starts to break down very very fast
throughout the day and I'm just gonna
give this one to know like it that I
don't I don't love it I mean it's not
horrible it's just I don't really like
it oh I forgot to tell you the price of
this this one is $40 and you get point
32 ounces sorry guys that completes this
video I hope it was helpful in some way
maybe you are in the market for some
high-end foundation 6 and maybe this
video helped you leave me a comment down
below if there's a high-end foundation
stick that you really really love that I
didn't mention today and maybe I'll
check it out yeah thank you guys so much
