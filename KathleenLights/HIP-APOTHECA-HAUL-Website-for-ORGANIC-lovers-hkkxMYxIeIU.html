a little bit different I honestly just
wanted to get on here and talk to you
guys about a new website I recently
discovered that is amazing and it is
called hip apotheca so it's hip apotheca
calm and it is perfect for those of you
guys who love organic and natural things
that is why I'm talking to you guys
about it because it is a very unique
website and they cater to really really
natural products on the website it says
naturally hip naturally you and has hair
care skin care makeup bath and body
fragrance vegan they have really good
stuff on this I was actually introduced
this website because I for some reason
randomly I have been getting a lot of
questions I get my inbox on YouTube
about the Antipodes around manuka honey
face mask I've got it actually a couple
of you guys asking me if I've tried it
and if I like how that Etsy button talks
about that brand all the time and I love
I love se button and I've heard a couple
of other people talk about it as well
but I was really curious to try that
brand and try that face mask and then I
discovered this website they don't only
sell Antipodes on the website they sell
a bunch of different natural brands and
a lot of them I had never heard of
before there were a few that I knew I
have heard them before but a lot of them
I didn't what you actually preferred
because it just introduced me to so many
different brands and I sound really
crazy right now but I'm just really
excited to share this website with you
and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen
this website before but it was really
new to me so anyway then I got in
contact with Michelle she is the
merchandising manager of this website I
was just telling her how much I heard
really good things about Antipodes and I
wanted to share that face mask and then
we were talking about like my skin and
how it's so dry and sensitive and all
that good stuff and then she was like go
on the website and look at all the
brands we have and let me know if you
would like to try anything and I was
like um absolutely I will I was like
Omni website overwhelmed by all the
amazing organic and natural beautiful
things that I saw and I told her a
couple of things that I thought would
work well for my skin and she sent me a
whole box full of stuff she was like
okay I'll add a couple of other things
and sent me a whole box full of stuff
yes this was gifted to me she did send
me all of these things but she did not
ask me to film a video she didn't ask me
to talk about these products it was just
her being nice and sending me these
things I really want to stress that
point out to you guys I am NOT being
sponsored I am NOT being paid to film
this video it wasn't like yeah send do
these things if you review them no it
was just her being sweet I have decided
to film this video because I really
wanted to introduce this website to you
guys because I know I have a lot a lot
of subscribers who are really really
into like vegan organic natural things
cruelty free all that stuff and this
website can offer that to you so yeah
I'm just gonna go ahead and share with
you guys the things that she sent me I
actually have only tried out 3 of the
things that she has sent me so the rest
I haven't used them yet but I really
wanted to share them with you guys
because they look good so she sent me
the SW basics of Brooklyn 8 reusable
cotton rounds eco-friendly cotton rounds
this is by the brand SW basics of
Brooklyn I have seen this brand a couple
of times but I don't remember where but
it looked really really familiar to me
when I saw it on the website and they're
just cotton rounds I guess I actually
haven't opened the bag yet so so yeah
and just come in this bag like this and
they are cotton rounds and they're so
cute they're fabric I guess these are
reusable in the sea yeah and I said that
already
they're 8 reusable cotton rounds and you
just stick them in your laundry so that
is so so cool I'm gonna be using this a
lot actually don't know how much those
cotton rounds go for I will say that
some of the things on the website not
all this stuff but some of the things
are a little bit pricey but considering
the ingredients I personally think
they're well worth it and I would pay
that money to buy them so the next thing
in here is something that I was actually
really interested
using and it is by the brand called one
love organics I have never heard of this
brand but it is called brand new day
micro derma scrub and mask mask
exfoliant microdermabrasion works
amazing on my skin and I love like
microdermabrasion scrubs and stuff like
that so I was really interested in
trying this it says it's a gentle
exfoliator for your brave and radiant
face the cool thing about this is that
you can use it in two different ways it
says if you want to use it as a face
scrub all you have to do is add a
teaspoon of brand-new day to warm water
and you massage it into your face and
then you rinse it off with warm water or
if you want to use it as a mask
you just get a teaspoon of water and a
teaspoon of this and it makes like a
paste and you put it all over your face
and you leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes
and then you remove it with warm water
and it says for a clarifying mask
instead of water use plain Greek yogurt
and for a hydrating mask instead of
water use honey so it'll be like a
hydrating one I'm really really excited
to try this I will let you guys know
what I think about it because this looks
like really good stuff so the next thing
is something that I was really really
excited to get for some reason and she
just threw this in there but it is also
from the one loved organics and it is
called the cleansing sponge 100% natural
cognac sponge okay you guys know that I
live for my doctor sponge this is my
doctor sponge it is a cognac sponge I
bought this myself and I use this to
clean my face every single day which by
the way they sell dr. sponge on this
website when I was looking at the
website I was like oh my god they sawed
off your sponge on this website so yeah
but she sent me a cognac sponge from the
brand called one love organics which is
a brand that I just showed you and it is
the rose Heart for dry sensitive skin
which is exactly the kind of skin I have
but it gets cuter let's get it gets
cuter guys look
can we look at this it's the same spot
it's the same thing but it's a heart it
is a beautiful little heart and I was
like when I saw this it is so cute I
know that's pretty stupid thing to think
it's cute but it is so cute I love it I
can't wait to use this
she sent me this all-natural tinted lip
and cheek balm and not exactly
Mullen and Sparrow is that the brand I'm
not exactly sure it like tinted balm to
give lips and cheeks a slight flush and
do we finish this is the only thing in
the box that I was like mad about
because it looks like a crazy like
purple color but it's not like that
don't worry but I thought I was going to
give me just a little bit of a tint and
it really doesn't it's just an ordinary
in the balm it does smell very fresh
though so it probably has really good
yeah it has really really good
ingredients in it it doesn't really give
me enough color to wear like on my
cheeks or on my lips or anything like
that this next thing I was really
excited to try and it is from the brand
called John masters organics this is
actually a brand that I've seen before
plenty of times I've heard really really
good stuff about this brand and it is
the new formula MOBA engine Singh
exfoliating face cleanser it is
certified organic and it is for all skin
types and this is what it looks like
it's a big old jar oh it's plastic is it
no it's glass
so yeah it's just an exfoliating face
cleanser I haven't tried this out yet
but I'm really excited to try it out and
because of my skin type I need to
exfoliate my skin pretty often so it was
very very like lemony not lemony but
like does this have like eucalyptus in
it
thing aloe vera jojoba ah has orange
peel it has like a fresh but citrusy
scent to this and wow this missus feels
really good yeah I'm excited to try this
the scent is very organic e if you like
things that smell like cupcakes and
vanilla and stuff like that then you
won't like this because it's like fresh
and citrusy but like leafy as well oh
that was a really bad description but
yeah it comes with four fluid ounces and
I'm excited I got this really cute bag
with four products in it this is from
the brand SW basics of Brooklyn but this
is a really a really really cool idea it
has a makeup remover right here
this tub is a cream this right here is a
toner and this right here is a cleanser
and I'm really excited to try this
because it is really really natural like
for example the makeup remover only has
three ingredients organic sweet almond
oil organic olive oil and organic whole
ohh-ho-ho boil the cream only has three
ingredients as well coconut oil olive
oil and shea butter the toner has five
ingredients water raw apple cider
vinegar
witch hazel essential oils of Clary sage
and sandalwood and the cleanser has
three ingredients organic rose water
organic vegetable glycerin and organic
tea tree oil so I am so so so excited
for this sure you can actually create
these things at home so that's also
really really good and the last four
things in my box are from the brand
Antipodes she sent me the joyful hand
and body cream and it says with pure
avocado oil wild blackcurrant berry and
South Pacific hibiscus flower and I've
actually haven't tried this a couple of
times and I really like it I'm not a
huge fan of hand cream but it smells bad
it smells so so good and I am obsessed
with the Antipodes packaging it just
doesn't it look super luxurious like
old-style toothpaste like it's like that
type of thing that when you like press
it stays in that shape I don't know I
really love the packaging and like as
you go down you just spend this you know
you like twist it I don't know I love it
she sent me the grace gentle cream
cleanser which is another thing that I
have really wanted to try and it says
with organic avocado oil marigold and
Pinot Noir antioxidant bonanza ox offend
yeah no idea what that says but yeah it
says it is certified organic and it says
there metallic a lot for some reason I
can never say this word I know what it
says but I could never say okay
dermatology literally okay hold on in
other words dermatologists approve of
this it says it's great for sensitive
skin so I have used this once and I
really really liked it it is very very
moisturizing it is a cream cleanser so
it is very very moisturizing I recommend
this to anybody with severe dry skin I
think I'm going to use this in the
winter time mostly because it is like so
thick hydrating and moisturizing and
cleans my face but for the summer time I
don't really think I need it that much
but in the winter when my skin is like
depressed and terrible this is like I
know I'm going to use this sucker up
like a mother because this stuff is no
joke it is on the pricey side but it is
organic so I mean you have to think
about it that way and if you are willing
to spend the money for this I recommend
it then I got what I had originally
really wanted it is the aura manuka
honey mask with vanilla pod pocket -
walka bloom and manuka honey active 20
plus I don't exactly know what that
means
but I have heard so many good things
about this specifically from Essie
button like I said earlier so I'm really
really really excited to try this and it
smells like smells like a mixture of
honey and
this by the way if you don't know it is
a mask that you put all over your face
and you leave it on for about 20 minutes
and even though it is a cream it does
dry like it hardens so it's kind of like
hydrating and clarifying at the same
time which is why I get so much buzz and
it's so hyped up because you don't come
across a lot of masks like that so
excited and then the last thing is the
rejoice like facial day cream with
nutrient-rich avocado oil manuka flower
and sweet almond I've also tried this
and I freaking love it
it says certified organic 100%
ingredients from natural origin this
disappears into my face like this even
though I have dry skin I don't like a
really thick moisturizer during the
daytime because it doesn't really sit
under foundation well and it's just I
don't like thick moisturizers in the
daytime and this is awesome I think I
recommend this for oily skin for dry
skin for normal skin because you put it
on your face and it immediately sinks
into your face and like disappears but
you feel hydrated at the same time I
don't know I really really loved this so
yeah that was all the stuff in my box
leave me a comment down below letting me
know if you want specific reviews on any
of these products or anything like that
