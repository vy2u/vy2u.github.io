really quick how-to video kind of like
how how I to how I do I'm gonna be
showing you guys how I apply my magnetic
accent lashes I recently uploaded a
drugstore haul not that long ago and I
showed you guys that I picked up a few
of these are no magnetic lashes I got
the accent lashes and then I got the
full strip lashes and I was wearing the
accents in that video and I told you
guys that I was really impressed with
the accent lashes and there was actually
so many comments from you guys asking me
to do a quick video dedicated to this
how I applied them how it works for me
and that's like I know what I want to do
so I do want to give you guys an update
I tried out the full strip lashes the
full magnetic strip lashes and they're
not my favorite they were just really
hard to apply I guess because it's a
full strip it's not as easy I personally
wouldn't recommend the full strip but
that's just me everybody everybody likes
different things I would say if you're
really interested in trying out these
magnetic lashes to go with the accents
first they're just easier to apply and
they actually look really nice it gives
you kind of like a cat eye effect these
will last so long they'll last forever
because there is no glue to mess them up
so I'm just gonna pick up my hair I'm
just gonna get it out of my face so this
is what they look like in the box you
can see they're very natural these are
the ones that I've been using I think
I've used these like seven times ready
the way I like to do it is I always make
sure I apply at my mascara before I go
in with these just because it doesn't
really work like regular lashes where
you can apply them first and then just
apply mascara to really mix them in and
make them look more natural the mascara
will kind of mess these up and they'll
kind of like pull it off it will pull
the lashes off and it's a little bit
strange so I would recommend going in
with mascara first and then popping on
your lash so this is actually pretty
easy and when you get the hang of it
it's even easier you can see here you
have an upper and an under so you want
to make sure that you're putting the
upper ones on the top of your lashes and
then you put the under ones under your
lashes obviously I know that's common
sense but I'm just letting you know so
I'll just take my upper pair I just
basically try to line these up with the
outer edges so I'll just pop these on
like this this is the first thing I do
is I put the ones on top and now try to
align them like I would normal fall sees
and once I feel like they're on and
they'll
good and they're comfortable I'll take
the under part and just boom put them
right there they just clip automatically
and then I'll just take my time and fix
them a little bit because we already
applied our mascara it does look a
little bit weird right here where the
lashes end like it looks very full here
and then not so full there so I'll take
this little guy right here you guys know
I love this little thing this is my
morphe b71
and i will just start to comb through
them make sure they don't look too
clumpy i actually filmed a video before
I sat down to film this one so I already
had applied a lot of my mascara and
usually I won't do that I'll just apply
it like a very thin coat of mascara and
I focus the majority of mascara right
here in the front since we're already
gonna have this side so full you want to
focus most of the mascara right here or
there isn't gonna be any false lash but
since I'm filming two videos today I
applied a lot of mascara like if I
wasn't gonna put on the lash and if you
ever feel like it's looking a little
strange all you have to do is apply more
mascara right here in this little area
and just kind of fix the situation but
it really is about trial and error and
yeah that's pretty much it I think this
is awesome for beginners if you really
want to test out if you like falsies on
you at all
but I'm gonna go ahead and pop on this
guy right now
alright guys so that's pretty much it
this is I think the fastest video I've
ever filmed and I do want to mention
something really quick just in case
you're looking at me and you're like
that doesn't look very natural honestly
this looks a lot better when you have
eye makeup on I don't have any eye
makeup on right now at all so it does
look a little bit crazy when there's
nothing on your lids it stands out a lot
more that way if I had a little bit more
going on in the eyes it would look a
little bit more natural and a little bit
better and also this looked a little
nicer if you only apply a very thin
layer of mascara and then focus the
majority of the mascara on the inner
corners of your eyes once you take those
two little things into consideration
I love these accent lashes they're very
comfortable to me it might take you a
few tries because you might get some
lashes stuck in between the magnet and
you might have to reposition it but
again there's no glue so there's no mess
I think this is so amazing for people
who really struggle with falsies so yeah
guys I have been loving these I know
there have been mixed reviews like on
Ulta or like all over the internet but
these accents personally just really
work for me and I like the look and I
hope you'll try it out let me know what
you think about these down below give me
your thoughts and opinions I don't like
the full strip but I really like these
yeah guys that completes this video
thank you so much for watching please

will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
