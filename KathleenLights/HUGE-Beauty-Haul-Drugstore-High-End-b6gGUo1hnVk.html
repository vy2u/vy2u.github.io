a humongous beauty haul now I was like
10 minutes into this video and I
realized I wasn't recording and I had
already thrown the packaging like into
my little garbage pile right here in
front of me
so I'm just going to quickly show you
the things that I had already started
with that's already out of the packaging
cuz I already hold it
I just wasn't recording so I'm gonna do
the drugstore portion first and then
I'll get into high-end products so let's
talk about all the drugstore goodies
this video is going to be so long I got
a ton of stuff
it was so requested to do a hartley
people are like you haven't done one in
like 3 months go buy some stuff and haul
it so I got these two brushes at Target
this is something I already hold these
are the target up and up brushes up and
up is the Target brand and I picked up
their powder brush and their blush brush
and I know I have like a six million
brushes but the reason why I wanted to
get these besides the fact that I've
heard amazing things from my friend
Laura and from Emily Noel the reason why
I really wanted to get this is when I do
my full face and drugstore tutorials I
love incorporating affordable brushes in
those videos too and these are super
super affordable so they feel amazing
like really really soft I cannot wait to
use these I also got this Maybelline
brow define and fill duo I got mine in
soft brown I had never seen this before
I haven't really heard that many people
talking about it and when I saw it at
Walgreens I picked it about Walgreens I
was really excited this is like nothing
I've ever seen before because you have
you have the product on one side like a
brow is a regular brow is on one side
and on the other side right here you
have a powder so you pretty much fill in
your brows and then you set it with this
powder and it really intrigued me
because I always set my brows with a
powder so I thought this would be an
amazing idea the only thing that's like
is that obviously it doesn't have a
spoolie because it has the
powder on the other side but I would
have to go in and use a spoolie but this
could be genius this could be amazing
for traveling I'll just take us fully by
the way if I sound a little raspy me and
my mom were having like a huge debate on
Brad Pitt yesterday and we were like
yelling at the top of our lungs okay so
I got a highlight from brand
wet-and-wild their Fergie collection and
I got the highlight in the shade of
Hollywood Boulevard and what really
intrigued me about this is that it has
pink and gold
veining throughout it so I thought this
would be really good and it's watch's
beautifully like not chunky not streaky
I'm not wearing it I'm wearing champagne
pop but let me just I mean I'm wearing a
lot of champagne pop but let me just
throw this on just so we can see I just
went from zero to 100 I think this one
is limited edition so definitely get
your hands on it Hollywood Boulevard it
has such a beautiful Sheen even when i
swatched on my fingers I knew it was a
good one and it's so affordable when a
wild always got the right prices okay so
this is gonna be really weird like this
is gonna sound extremely weird but I got
the Nivea men sensitive post shave balm
I got this at Publix and I want to say
it was like 10 bucks
it has three point three fluid ounces it
doesn't have alcohol in it and the
reason why I bought this is because
nikkietutorials uses this and says it's
amazing as a primer because of the
glycerin that kind of threw me off but
it intrigued me at the very same time so
I wanted to buy it and I wanted to see
if maybe you guys would be interested in
doing a like first impressions kind of
video where I only put it on half of my
face I got Prime with this on only half
of my face and not the other half and
see how the makeup is at the end of the
day with using this as a primer and
hopefully it doesn't break me out or
clog my pores it is for sensitive skin
so hopefully it doesn't do that but I
think that would be really really
interesting this I actually got
off the Milani website if you saw my
liquid lipstick review from Milani they
came out with limited edition amore
matte lip creams and I was telling you
guys that I wanted crush so bad but it
was sold out at Walgreens they restocked
all of them on the Milani website I
don't exactly know by the time you're
watching this if it's still in stock but
when I saw they restocked them I ran and
I bought crush it's such a pretty brown
red and I really like these they're
affordable and I really like him so I
picked the crush so as we get closer to
like the holidays I wanted to do a full
like really intense green makeup
tutorial and I wanted to include like a
drugstore green and I didn't really have
an emerald green from the drugstore so I
picked this little bad boy up this is
the lorry oh.um infallible eyeshadow in
golden emerald and it's such a stunning
green these are so intense and pigmented
and I think that this would look so
pretty all over the lid so I expect me
using this in a tutorial in the future I
finally decided to pick up a Maybelline
fit me powder for my entire face I use
135 creamy natural under my eyes all the
time because it's amazing and I was like
why haven't I tried one that like
matches my skin tone so I could use it
on my face so that's what I did I got
220 natural beige and it does look a
little bit light for me but I've noticed
that when I set my face with a powder
that's like a little bit dark or like
too much like my skin tone I can see it
when I said it is that weird
that's just how I feel so I always go
like a shade lighter so I got 220
natural beige and this powder is amazing
for dry skin it doesn't emphasize any
dryness but if you have oily skin they
have a matte version oh right in so the
rest of these products I got at Ulta
volca I decided to jump in and buy some
more essence products essence is like
under five dollars like almost
everything is under five dollars and
they are so underrated their products
are actually really
really nice so I got two more of their
silky touch blushes because I have the
shade baby doll
something yeah I have baby doll and it's
beautiful I used it in my wedding makeup
tutorial amazing so I decided to pick up
this one this one's in the shade autumn
peach it's a really pretty coral peach
color this is actually what I'm wearing
on my cheeks right now but I lightly
dabbed it on like you could barely see
it I just wanted a hint of warmth and
it's beautiful these are so good and
they're like two books so good and then
I got this one this is the shade
adorable it's a very very very soft
light Barbie kind of pink but it's not
too intense it's just so pretty
so I got those too I highly recommend
them and then I got two essence
lipsticks these two right here this is
from their regular line like they have
these year-round and I got this shade
barely there it's like a dark dark mauve
color I really really love it these
essence lipsticks amazing you mean they
smell a little bit like drugstore
lipsticks but very faint
nothing like L'Oreal and then this is
from their like new nude collection and
this one is in the shade cool nude it's
also a mauve but a little bit lighter
than that one and then I got three
essence lip liners because they're
amazing so so good I have the lip liner
in the shade of satin mauve and if you
don't have that lip liner from essence
go buy it it's like two dollars amazing
guys such a good lip liner so creamy and
their wooden lip liners but they are so
creamy they're better than Mac lip
liners Mac wooden lip liners because I
really love their pro long wear lip
liners but the one ones these are better
than those so I picked up three other
colors I would be interested interested
in this one is in the shade femme fatale
it's a red for some reason I don't have
like a true cherry drugstore red
lipstick red lipliner can I speak and
then I got this one I thought this would
be perfect for fall this is honey berry
it's a really pretty berry shade and
then I got in the nude because it's just
a classic nude color okay
for NYX products I bought this because
Laura
mrs. Llewellyn was wearing it in a migit
tutorial and it looked so beautiful that
I bought it the second I saw her
applying it to her face this is just a
regular eyeliner these are not new these
are so old it's there
slide on glide on eyeliner in the shade
golden bronze I thought this would be
like the most ideal most perfect fall
eyeliner in the world it's such a
beautiful copper shade like a reddish
golden eat copper it's amazing she was
completely right if you don't have this
eyeliner go get it it's perfect for this
time of year perfect and then finally
finally I was able to snag three of
their liquid suede cream lipsticks these
are similar to liquid lipsticks but I
hear that these don't dry down
completely matte which kind of throws me
off but then at the same time it kind of
intrigues me like how does it feel on
the lips then what is the deal so I got
three of them they finally restocked it
on Ulta I got kitten heels a beautiful
holiday red then this one it's just like
a everyday kind of pink shade it's
called tea and cookies and then this one
in the shade sandstorm it's like a nude
but a brown like a brown nude and then
the rest of the products I got at Ulta
were nail products so every time OPI
comes out with a new collection I always
look at it maybe buy one maybe two
shades from the new collection but I've
never been like wow I love this freakin
collection in such a long time but I was
like wow I love this collection for
their new Venice fall collection all the
colors are beautiful half of the colors
are not very fall appropriate when it
comes to nail polish but I mean who
cares they're like kind of pastel e but
the whole collection is beautiful so I
bought this little set of the Venice
collection fall winter 2015
this comes with four nail polishes and a
I'm sure isn't that's Nicolas beautiful
really this first one is called a great
opportunity and I actually wore this
nail polish at my best friend's baby
shower and I could not stop staring at
my nails it's such a pretty melon shade
I don't have anything like it it's so
stunning I loved it so much that I just
purchased the big bottle and it's on its
way and I bought it because these are
amazing I love these to travel with but
I just go through these quicker
honestly like I love getting these
little sets because whenever I like go
to California or we're never on mom
vacation and I want to take a nail
polish these little ones are just so
much easier for me so but I love that
shade that I needed it in a big version
so this one's called a great opportunity
this one is worth a pretty penny
amore at the grand canal beautiful red
this one's like a shiny metallic color
and then this one's like a black and
it's called my gondola or yours
surprisingly I don't have black nail
polish but I'm into it recently I've
been into like black lips and black
nails I really like it so I'm glad that
it came with a little black one and then
I just couldn't get enough of this
collection that I bought five full-size
colors from the collection this is the
first one I was drawn to even before I
bought that little set this one is
called its sepia it's a cake it's a
piazza cake this is the color I'm
wearing on my nails right now I bought
it because I literally thought this was
Miami fever in a bottle and I love
matching my lips to my nails or my
eyeshadow to my nails
it's like aesthetically pleasing for me
I know that's weird but it's just
something I really enjoy so I got that
one and this is another one that I was
so drawn to for some reason I think of
Hannah from Pretty Little Liars every
time I see colors like this you're like
in the first season she really wore
colors similar to this anyway so this is
st. marks the spot a beautiful midnight
blue with a sheen this one is tiramisu
for two I have like a million OPI colors
that look like this but I can't get
enough of nude colors it's just
easy and it goes with everything and
then this one is called a cannoli where
OPI this is like a white with a hint of
gray and a hint of blue I think it's
really really beautiful and then this
one is like not very fall at all but
it's beautiful I love blue nail polish
and this one is called gelato on my mind
and yeah gelato on my mind you're
beautiful so those were all the nail
polishes I bought a little bit excessive
but I just recently went through all
that my nail polishes and gave a ton to
my mom so of course I was the old in
with the new you know okay so now let's
move on to the things I bought at
Sephora the rest of these products are
high-end wow this video is a million
years long five things from the Sephora
brand I never buy anything from the
Sephora collection but you know what I
was like I'm gonna try out Sephora brand
stuff I got this this is the Sephora
ultimate oil in lipstick remover my
friend Laura says that she really really
loves this because it takes off liquid
lipsticks really well and I was like
that's kind of stupid right I'll just
use an oil or a makeup wipe and I'll get
my liquid lipstick off no big deal but
I'm constantly wearing liquid lipsticks
it's like it's the only thing I wear
these days and I thought it might come
in handy and it was so affordable so I
thought it was like pretty gimmicky but
pretty interesting at the same time it's
like a liquid lipstick remover huh
I'm excited to live and I saw this guy
it finally came back in stock what is
this happening Rossini's this finally
came back in stock I have been wanting
to get my hands on this before ever it
is the mud mask from Sephora I heard a
lot of people compare this to the glam
glow mud mask the one in the white tub a
lot of reviews on the website said that
this was just as good some people even
said that it was better than the glam
glow mask and it's so much cheaper Danny
loves the glam glow mask he uses it on
his head all the time so I'm gonna try
this on his head and then on my face as
well speaking of the dupes I got the
Sephora brand solid brush cleaner I
didn't even know that they had this I
have no idea if this is new or old but I
am a big
big fan of the Beautyblender solid
cleanser it's the only thing I use to
wash my brushes and to wash my beauty
blender and then they came out with like
they were what is this oh my gosh I
don't know what this is for this is like
this smells amazing so it comes with
this like rubbery thing kind of like a
sigma brush glove like it's that texture
with the rough and bumpy nasai wonder
what exactly that's for but yeah I have
high hopes for this as well I hope it's
just as good if not better because it
smells amazing and then I got this bad
boy right here this is the Sephora brand
like I've said if they're mad bronzer in
the shade Los Cabos I heard from a lot
of people that this is a great contour
bronzer because it is like a cool tone
bronzer if I could just openly oh yeah
it it's very cool this is what it looks
like let me swatch eesh lunch feels very
nice and very light and like easy to
blend and then the last Sephora brand
thing I bought is this now this didn't
have the best reviews online but I had a
few good ones this is the radiant
luminizing drops you're supposed to
shake really well and drop this into
your foundation to like mix I got mine
in the shade morning light this is
basically just like a liquid illuminator
that you mix with your foundation this
looks to me like it has a little bit of
shimmers in it like a little bit of
glitter particles like very fine glitter
though I can't tell in this and really
close but the ultimate test is of course
mixing it with foundation this is the
bike BB cream lip gloss in the shade
opal this was out of stock and back in
stock and out of stock and back in stock
and I was like why why are so many
people liking like buying this is it
amazing I must buy it that's my logic so
this is what it looks like it's really
cute little packaging and it's just an
opal like um an iridescent lipgloss
that's the only thing that assigned how
I can describe it it has like a
pink shift when you swatch it I haven't
even tried it on my lips but it has it
really pretty iridescent pink shift it
might be good to like make your there's
a rooster out my window there's always
roosters hanging out in my yard all the
time and I wouldn't upset me except I am
terrified of them this might be good to
just use like in the center of your lips
to make your lips look juicy er which
he'll see and then my friend Sarah from
the Beauty buzz have told me that this
was a really good product
says the Clinique just browsing brush on
styling mousse pretty sure this is a new
product it looks really similar to like
the bottom lash mascara only it's brown
what color did I get mine in light brown
these doesn't look like brown it's not
like the benefit gimme brow because the
benefit gimme brow does have like little
fibers in it and this doesn't is just
like a mousse so I'm really excited to
use this to see if it's one of those
products that it's great like completely
on its own I got this
I was so suckered into buying this
because of the packaging because it
looks cool oh I'm such a fool this is
the this is brand-new pretty much this
is the glam glow pout mud it's for your
lips so you have the wet lip balm
treatment and the fizzy lip exfoliating
treatment so you put this part on first
the fizzy lip and then you apply the
balm treatment I think you like leave it
overnight I'm not exactly sure I haven't
even opened this yet oh my gosh these
look like pokeballs what this is what
they look like okay this one says fizzy
mud and this one says wet mud it says to
apply to your lips and massage for five
to seven seconds to pre exfoliate gently
massage with water to activate fizzing
renewal action so you massage it a
little bit for 10 seconds then add water
keep massaging and then rinse with warm
water use 2 to 3 times per week and then
after you do the fizzy 1/2 apply evenly
to lips use day and/or night as often as
desired so I would probably just leave
it overnight I'm going to try this today
for the first time and then I will
update you guys in another video maybe
if favorites oral products I hope you're
buying because this was this was
hella expensive that's expensive 100%
it's like $20 per ball because it was
like a $40 product so I sugary doesn't
smell the best it smells kind of like
mint and I don't like the scent of mint
grey I want to see what this smells like
I hope it doesn't snow minty yep it does
beautiful okay now that we're on that
subject for four hours I got the makeup
forever Ultra HD foundation I already
have this but I have my self tanning
shade and I didn't have one when I am
this color so I bought it I'm in the
shade 140 equals why 305 like the new
color is now why 305 this foundation is
amazing quickly has become my second
favorite foundation of all time the
first one being the makeup forever face
and body foundation I love this one even
more than the original I know a lot of
people don't agree but I do so I had to
pick up my regular shade and I cannot
find it anywhere but I bought the Ultra
HD
stick like their new foundation stick
that I haven't heard like barely anybody
talking about I bought that one too
can't find it I was gonna use it today
to try it for the very first time
because I've never tried it before but
just know I bought that one too I got
this because I have heard everybody
talking about it everybody has been
raving about it so I decided to buy it
and see what the hype was about this is
the Tarte swirl power cheek brush it's
basically a giant fluffy contour brush
and I wasn't going to get it because I
have the elf one and the elf one is
amazing and it's like six dollars but I
decided to buy it I'm really upset
though because mine has like this weird
thing here like if the hairs were bent
so it it literally bothers me but maybe
after washing it I could fix that
problem but yes it's basically like a
fat eater brush but better because the
ITO brush sucks so bad so I don't know
I'm excited to try it it's very soft
this little
is really gonna drive me crazy miss
prissy and then the last two things this
is brand new I saw it in the just
arrived section at Sephora and I wanted
to try even though I didn't like the
bareMinerals bare skin foundation this
is the bare minerals bare skin concealer
complete coverage serum concealer I got
mine in fair which this is the lightest
shade and I think they could have done
better and gone lighter this is perfect
for me but for like very very very very
fair skin this might be too dark so this
is what it looks like I actually heard
really really good things about it and
it feels really nice in the back of my
hand really really lightweight and then
the last thing I'm a little bit
disappointed a little bit last year
Bobby Brown came out with two amazingly
beautiful looking highlighters they came
out with the bronze glow and the pink
glow I believe and I have the bronze
glow and it's stunning it is beautiful
but I don't use it in my videos because
it was a limited edition product and I
hate teasing people but they just came
out with them again they just restocked
them on Sephora and I ran to get pink
glow because when I went to go get pink
glow pink glow was sold out and I was
only able to get bronze glow so I got
pink glow they came up with the same
things only in different packaging my
bronze glow isn't like the most
beautiful Bobby Brown packaging ever
this one is just in this little
packaging is what it looks like and it's
so beautiful in the pan but when I
swatch it it's like not as actually a
bronze glow is just so thin and like
such a beautiful sheen and applies
heavenly this one seems like it isn't as
shiny but you know what I have to try it
out on my face I cannot I cannot judge
this without swiping it on my cheeks
first and I would do it right now but
Mama's got a lot of highlight on so
finally I'm able to get my hands on pink
glow I'm very excited can't wait to put
it on my face
okay guys so that completes this video I
know a lot of stuff mama went am at the
drugstore and at Sephora so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me leave me

of these products what you think about
