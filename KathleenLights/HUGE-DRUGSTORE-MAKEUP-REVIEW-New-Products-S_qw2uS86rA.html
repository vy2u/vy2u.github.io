gonna be my huge drugstore review my
huge drugs to review I have promised
this video a while ago but I prolonged
it because I still wanted to try out
each individual product and give you
like my real true thoughts because some
of these I liked at first and then I
kind of changed my mind about them
I cannot base my reviews on first
impressions I need to use it more than
once to give you a full review like a
real actual review so yeah that is what
this video is about today I'm gonna be
reviewing products that I hauled in the
past so I did like two very large
drugstore hauls not extremely recently
one of them was really recent the other
one was couple months ago and I told you
guys I was gonna do like an update what
worked and what didn't
so this video is kind of like a
drugstore hits and misses products that
have recently come out or at least
within the last three months some of
them are a little bit newer than that
but just recent releases from the
drugstore I'm really going to try to get
through this video as fast as I can
so I'm gonna go through things like
really quickly just tell you my
straight-up thought I'm going to show
you swatches and just move on and I'm
gonna try to make this quick so I'm
gonna go in categories so it's easier
for me to compare like why I like this
one over this one and things like that
so I'm gonna get started with primers so
the two eyeshadow primers that I've
recently tried out are the NYX glitter
primer and the Maybelline master prime
long-lasting eyeshadow base I cannot
find my other one I had two of these
this one is the prime and illuminate I
had the other one that is prime and
smoothing and I don't know where it is
so I really like both of these I think
this is an amazing glitter primer I
might like this one even more than my
ELF one and I love my ELF glitter glue
with that being said this one is a
little bit pricier but I just I love the
packaging and I love how sticky it is
aiya shadows pigments glitters things
really really adhere to this it's a
great great great glitter primer and as
for the master prime I love this one and
I don't love the smoothing one I don't
find that it makes my eyeshadows last
longer even though this claims to be
long lasting I don't find that's the
case I think they're just regular
eyeshadow bases but I do like the one
that's in the illumination version
because it's nice and
memory so it looks really really pretty
underneath shimmery eyeshadows so
because of that I will continue to use
this one and I probably will not be
using the smoothing one which is okay
since I lost it so we're staying on the
primer topic but we're moving on to face
primers and these are two face primers
that I've recently tried out that are in
the spray form this is the Physicians
Formula primer Argan wear argan oil with
coconut water primer I use this in a
video and I used it for the first time
and I really really liked it but I think
that my opinion has changed
I do still really like it but it's a
little bit messy for me like I will
apply this to my entire face I will
prime my face with this and when I look
at my desk or anything that's near me it
creates a film on everything like there
was a film on my phone a film on my
powder compacts like it creates a greasy
film on things that are around you I
don't know that that may seem weird but
I just wanted to give you guys a heads
up also when I first use this I loved
that it wasn't greasy it felt so nice on
my skin I really liked it but I think
that my skin is sensitive to this I
don't know if it's like the argan oil
and the coconut which is usually really
good for my skin I feel like it makes my
face a little bit itchy I've also tried
out three other face primers why is it
out you can't even see it
so mean the first one is this Milani
prime perfection hydrating and pore
minimizing they have two different ones
they have a black one that is pore
minimizing and mattifying now this one
just felt like a basic moisturizer to me
I don't hate it but I don't love it
this did not minimize my pores at all at
all so it's like why you say that if
that's not true I mean everybody's skin
is different but this is just okay in my
opinion this one on the other hand I
love love love love love this is the NYX
born to glow illuminating primer this
reminds me so much of my mac strobe
cream I love it it's a lot more
affordable obviously it's NYX it's
amazing this gives you such a beautiful
dewy luminous glow these are the kind of
primers I prefer and then the one that I
absolutely hated was the covergirl
trublend face primer for
dry skin this smells like Elmer's glue
straight up like paste and it broke me
out severely I don't like this at all
okay so my next category is foundations
and I've been trying out for foundations
they're sitting right there I'm going to
start off with these two right here this
is the Maybelline Dream velvet soft
matte hydrating foundation I have mine
in the shade sandy beige this is 100%
not my color it's way too dark for me I
bought this online at drugstore comm and
so but it's fate because I have my Manic
Panic white foundation that I mix in
with art foundations and it works
perfectly fine but anyway this is okay I
don't hate this nor do I love this I
have very very dry skin and while this
says it's a hydrating foundation I don't
find that to be the case I found that it
caked up around my nose and in between
my eyebrows I think that this would be
amazing for normal to oily skin if you
have severe dry skin like I do I
probably would stay away from this it's
something about the consistency of the
foundation that sits on top of my dry
skin and it doesn't really sink in this
foundation I love this is the foundation
I'm wearing on my face right now this is
the Milani conceal imperfect two-in-one
foundation and concealer I have mine in
light beige I don't think this is light
at all this is really dark
it's much too dark for me but I mixed it
in with my Manic Panic white foundation
so you like my man bun this is great I
think this would fit so many different
skin types like I have dry skin I've
said 30 times and I find that it doesn't
dry out my skin I don't think it gets
too cakey but it is full coverage like
full coverage it is a matte finish like
I said I'm wearing it on my face but
even though it's matte and full coverage
it doesn't cake up on my face I don't
know what it is but I really really like
this it looks really great in pictures
and product blends really nicely on top
of it I just saw I love this foundations
it's one of my new favorite drugstore
foundations for sure
I love the packaging it comes with a
pump and I bought mine on the Milani
website because I haven't seen it in
stores yet okay and cushion foundations
have been like all the rage recently and
I have two to share with you guys right
here first one is the Physicians Formula
mineral wear cushion
nation I have mine in the shade light
this does match my skin tone perfectly
fine now for me I have to say that I
have to pass on this one this dried out
my skin and I find that so weird because
it's a cushion foundation and usually
they're a little bit more hydrating but
this got not that I got cakey because
it's not a cakey foundation because very
lightweight it's like light coverage but
it hung on to the dry parts around my
face like around my nose and especially
the crustiness around my mouth it really
really emphasized my dry flakes but it
wasn't cakey it was so weird as for this
one this is the L'Oreal Lumi cushion I
have mine in w2 it is a little bit pinky
even though it's W it's weird but um
this is what it looks like you just take
it off if you don't know what a cushion
foundation is the Physicians Formula is
just like this you just take it off take
a little sponge you dab it in and then
you apply it to your face
a lot of people like on YouTube have
just been throwing away their sponge I
personally think that it applies best
with these little sponges
this one looks beautiful on my skin I
love how long wearing it is it looks so
fresh and dewy and gorgeous I don't have
really anything negative to say about
this one besides the color I love it the
only thing I will say is that these are
so pricy my Milani one that I just spoke
of Porter
excuse me don't you on that no no the
Milani foundation I just spoke about is
so inexpensive because it's Milani it's
definitely under ten dollars like
definitely under and these are like
sixteen dollars that's spent especially
especially because this L'Oreal one
comes with point fifty one fluid ounces
and the Physicians Formula one comes
with point forty seven fluid ounces a
typical foundation is one fluid ounce
this isn't even an entire ounce and it's
really pricey for drugstore okay so my
next category is concealers and I really
only tried out these two this is the wet
and wild highlighting and concealing pen
mine is in the shade ivory into you it's
not as light as you would think but I
love this I love love love this
specifically tie light I like to mix
this in with other concealer today I
have it underneath my eyes mixed in with
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer I
feel like it just makes
other concealers blend nicely I love
this it's only a few dollars this
concealer I don't like I used it in a
recent video and I oh I haven't even
told you what it is this is the BB
concealer from Physicians Formula and
it's really cute has really cute
packaging but it has this sponge here at
the top and normally I'm okay with that
because my maybelline instant age rewind
has a sponge and I find that I really
love that sponge but it's a different
sponge completely this one soaks up all
the product and I just I don't like it
it's a little bit too greasy for
underneath my eyes it was really easy to
use I just I don't like this sponge and
I don't like the coverage I don't like I
just don't like it
I can't I'm sorry I just don't okay so
for face powders I only tried out one
and I tried out the Milani prep set and
go transparent face powder I've used
this a ton I'm not exactly sure if you
can tell after trying out my are CMA no
color powder that's literally ten
dollars and you get an insane amount of
product I just I don't see myself using
this one because I have that one and if
I'm going to be completely honest I
don't think this is 100% transparent
it's definitely not the worst drugstore
powder I've ever used at all I like it
but I like my RCM a powder more so I'm
kind of judging it based on that but
that one is so inexpensive and so good
so okay so my next category is bronzers
blushes and highlight I'm just meshing
them all into one I'm gonna start off
with these two bronzers both by
Physicians Formula this is the super BB
insa ready bronzer in the shade bronzer
and this is the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer in the shade bronzer I
was confused I thought that there was
only one shade of this but a lot of you
guys have told me that there is a color
called light bronzer this one is just
the bronzer this hands-down has become
one of my favorite drugstore bronzers of
all time I think Physicians Formula
makes the best bronzers this one is so
good
I love it I think I like my original
bronze booster a little bit more than
this because I've just been using that
one for years and it's Holy Grail but
this one is becoming Holy Grail this
smells like a pina colada but it's a
very strong scent I will
I'll let you guys know right off the bat
it's a great scent but it's a strong one
I love the undertone in this it's like a
neutral bronzer it just looks beautiful
you could contour with this or you can
bronze your face I have nothing negative
to say about this the next one is this
super BB insa ready and at first I
thought I liked this but I realized this
just does not show up on my skin that's
pretty much the only reason why I don't
like this is you would think it would
show up on my skin but it just does not
show up on my skin it's too light for me
to bronze I have to use so much of the
product I have to dip my brush in a lot
I want to talk about these two
contouring palettes this is the
Maybelline master contour face
contouring kit and this is what it looks
like I got mine in the shade light I
believe I'm a little bit iffy on this
product I love it but then I don't love
it these two products right here I am
crazy about I think they are beautiful
this is the blush I'm wearing on my
cheeks right now even though I use a
very light hand but it's such a pretty
blush and this highlight is the
highlight I'm wearing on my face right
now and it is beautiful it's not chunky
it's not glittery it's a true true sheen
when I swatch it I'm like oh it's not
going to show up that much but on my
actual cheekbones I really really love
this I think it's beautiful I don't like
the contour powder at first I was like
it's okay but I realized you know what I
just I don't like this contour powder
it's a little bit too red for me even
though it doesn't look like it is in the
pan I use it today to contour and I
don't know if you guys can tell it's
it's just too red for my liking I like
something a little bit more neutral this
I love I love I love I love everything
about this this is the one wild my glow
contouring palette this in the shade due
to the littering I think this is a
beautiful contouring powder it blends
really really nicely this is only a few
dollars and I feel like I get a nice
chiseled contoured look I love it and
this is a great powder to set underneath
your eyes okay yes she is I'm gonna talk
about the covergirl trublend blush is
really quick I have two shades I have
medium Rose and light rose I love these
both I think that they are stunning
there is a third color I didn't pick
that one up because I found that I
wasn't going to reach for that one that
much they are so glowy and beautiful
like if you want
that luminous cheek like that really
beautiful flushy Rosie beautiful glowy I
keep saying that but these are so
gorgeous on the cheeks I think that
they're kind of like a mixture between a
blush and a highlight which I love
products like this so I highly recommend
these blushes they're really good and
then I have these from one while to
share with you these are actually not
new products at all but they did
reformulate them and change the
packaging and I didn't have their older
versions anyway this one is new though
this is in the shade rose champagne
this one is pearlescent pink and this
one is mellow wine these are the wet and
wild color icon blushes and they are
phenomenal they're so pigmented you have
to have you have to be really careful
they're very pigmented but they're
beautiful I have nothing negative to say
about any of these I think all the
colors are beautiful I love rose
champagne it looks so natural on the
cheeks and the only individual highlight
that I had been trying out was the when
Wild mega glow illuminating palette
honestly if I'm going to be completely
honest with you it's not my favorite
it's a little bit too glittery for me it
just looks really strange on my face I
don't know it's not my favorite but it
isn't expensive and it's a good product
I just have other highlights that I
liked more from the drugstore
okay next category is eyeshadow palettes
I've been trying out a few brands but
mostly recently I have been trying out
the Revlon palettes the Milani palette
and the covergirl palette I'm going to
start with the Revlon ones these are the
Revlon Colorstay not just nudes palettes
I had really high expectations for these
because I love the color stay range this
one is in passionate nudes and some of
them are really good some of them are
really bad like some of them I don't get
any color payoff I tried to use these
and I don't know I kind of struggle with
this a little bit it's not my favorite I
do think that this is a little bit
better than the Maybelline palette I
don't like the Maybelline eyeshadow
palette this one is a little bit better
this one is in romantic nudes and again
goes for this one like this color right
here is garbage but like you see this
matte chocolate color is really good
it's hit and miss with these palettes
now these Milani ones I love and I
highly recommend
men I will say out of all the drugstore
pilots I've ever tried the Milani ones
are my favorite I'm wearing this one on
my eyes today this one is called the
bare necessities palette I love these
Milani palettes I think they're
phenomenal the only eye shadow in all of
these palettes that I've never really
liked is this big one right here from
the earthy elements palette but I love
them the other one I have is plum basics
if you're looking for a national palette
from the drugstore
I think Milani is where it's at I love
them and then the other palette I tried
was the covergirl true naked Golden's
palette I want to pick up the rosy one
because I was very very very impressed
with this palette I like the Milani went
a little bit more because I find that
they last longer on my eyes these are a
little bit softer they look more
pigmented initially but because they're
so soft I find they fade a little bit
faster throughout the day than the
Milani ones but these are also really
really good 20 times better than the
Maybelline palette and I like it a lot
more than the Revlon palette as well
okay so I'm staying with the eyeshadow
trend here and I'm going to talk about
individual eyeshadows and they are the
ones from laurio these are the new
L'Oreal color riche eyeshadows and I
love them I think they're so good
there's not much to say about them I
think they are so buttery so pigmented
really quickly I'm going to tell you the
ones that I own and the swatches you saw
from left to right this one is sunset 2
to violet number 208 this one is quartz
fumé number 204 a beautiful chocolate
shade and then this last one I have is
green promenade so beautiful I love
these so much I also have some eyeshadow
sticks to share with you guys I would
consider these kind of like primers as
well I shadow bases you get it these are
the Maybelline Color tattoo 24-hour
concentrated crayons I had such high
expectations for these because I'm
obsessed with the Maybelline Color
tattoos in the pots and these are pretty
freakin good I really do like these I
think they have great color payoff they
last a long time on the lid but I like
the pops more actually like them a lot
more I find that the ones in the pots
are a little bit more pigmented and a
little bit more long-lasting have mine
in the shade barely beige which is a
really pretty champagne I have this gold
one in gold rush this one in creamy
chocolate is stunning and then the last
one I have
is charcoal chrome okay so my next
category is eyeliner is a felt tip
eyeliner from Wet n Wild and I love this
this is the eyeliner I'm wearing today
this is only like three dollars and I
find it so easy to use I love it it's so
so black and so long wearing I highly
recommend this it's called the proline
felt tip eyeliner I have mine in black
and I think it's amazing and then I have
these two also from when a wild and
these are their graphic marker eyeliners
I don't know what I was thinking I knew
I was gonna like this this it looks like
a straight up marker and while they're
pigmented you know the formula isn't bad
I just I can't use him I'm not that good
with these like these are hard to use in
my opinion if you are a pro at eyeliner
like no matter what you might like these
but they're just a little bit harder for
me to use and then the last eyeliner I
tried out is the L'Oreal infallible
matte Matic mechanical eyeliner oh it
has a sharpener huh and I really really
like this this is the eyeliner I'm
wearing on my waterline today it's
really really long wearing super black
and really nice but I like my NYX
twice-yearly gel liner more my next
category is brows and I've tried a few
brow things let's start off with the
thing I really did not like at all this
is the Maybelline brow drama pomade
crayon this is what it looks like I've
only used it once and I knew I didn't
like it the second I use this it's a
pomade but it's thick and it's waxy and
it did not work on my brows it made my
brows look horrible and I just don't
understand this I feel like what are you
gonna do when this thing is no longer
sharp like that like once you use it so
much that it's like a ball you know it's
not sharp it's gonna be so hard to get a
precise application it's gonna be so big
I don't know I just I was not a fan of
this Maybelline product whatsoever a
product I was a fan of this is the new
Loreal brow stylist definer what is that
you guys know the Loreal brow stylist
plumper is my Holy Grail brow gel and
it's from the drugstore this is amazing
it's just as good as the Anastasia brow
is I love the spoolie I love I love
everything about it I think I'm wearing
it right now on my brows I think it's
amazing they also came out with a little
brow stylist prep and shape brow kit and
to be honest
I don't know I don't like these little
kits I don't know what I was thinking
buying it I just wanted to try it out
I much prefer like an actual brow Wiz I
guess this would be considered a brow
product because it's called the ultimate
brow highlighter but this wet and wild
ultimate brow highlighter is just too
pink so it's not my favorite I tried out
two new brow gels which are really
exciting and this is the ultimate brow
mascara from when a wild I'm wearing it
on my brows today I really really like
it the this is in the shade nothing but
brunette this is a little bit too dark
for me like too dark for me but I really
really like how it made my eyebrows look
a little bit thicker a little bit more
filled in I really really love this this
one I did not like this is the Milani
easy brow tinted fiber gel I found that
this did nothing I don't know what I
feel like I love the size of the wand I
love the concept I like the color
I like the has little fibers in it but
it just did not show up on my brows like
I had to keep dipping the one back in to
get color payoff and it was just I don't
know I just I did not like it I feel
like it didn't nothing okay my next
category is mascaras and I tried out two
actual mascaras and these two are like
fiber mascaras this actually came in a
set right here this is the wet wild duo
I don't really remember what it's called
I think it's called lash ohm attic or
something like that this is the lash
fiber and this is the actual mascara
you're supposed to apply the mascara
then go over it with the fibers then go
over with the mascara again you're
supposed to get really voluminous lashes
I don't love this I actually do like
this mascara on its own this fiber
product I guess I'm just not a fan of
fiber things in general I find that
these like get in my actual eyeball it
like creeps me out like the product
falls all over my face it's just like
did you see that I don't know if you can
tell like what can you see all of that I
mean obviously you're not supposed to
open it like a savage like that
and I don't like the idea of this but
this mascara is actually really good and
makes my lashes look nice and voluminous
this is another fiber product this is
the length and seconds lash extensions
fibers and I feel the same way about
this that I do about the wet and wild
one maybe it's
me and I'm just not someone who's into
the fiber thing and then the mascara
that I tried out and loved this is the
volume and length magnified Revlon
mascara I think it's a great mascara it
gives me both length and volume I love
it okay let's talk about brushes I
bought brushes from two separate brands
I know that Milani came out with new
brushes and I haven't tried those at all
but I bought the Revlon brushes and then
I bought the Wet n Wild brushes I don't
like these one they're so pricey this
one was like 15 bucks and even though
it's really soft when you touch it it's
kind of scratchy to your face the only
one that I do truly like is this one
this is like a dual fiber it's it's
really good but again it's kind of
pricey these shed on me like while I'm
applying product especially this one
this is the it doesn't even say a name
okay I think it's their blush brush but
while I'm applying product on to my face
this just sheds all over my face the
same with this like it sheds on my face
I don't think this is worth the money I
think that you can save your money and
get peace I'm so impressed with these
and I'm kicking myself in the arse
because those I paid like a lot of money
for those brushes and these were like
under $5 each individual brush it was
like 4 bucks these wet and wild brushes
are phenomenal guys if you can find them
please pick them up I got them at
Walgreens this is their like it doesn't
say that name on it but this is like
their kabuki brush kabuki like face
buffer brush this applies foundation
beautifully oh my god I love all of them
you can tell like I've used them the
wetter the new what a wild brushes are
amazing I highly recommend them if you
are looking for brushes even if you're
not on a budget these are so good and I
think everybody should use them
ok now I'm into the lips category I'm
going to talk about the ones that I
actually do like these are the new sort
of these were re-released I guess these
are the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
glosses I'm wearing this one right now
on my lips in the shade bear attraction
a lot of people don't like them because
they're like oh my gosh this is a liquid
lipstick and it doesn't feel like a
liquid lipstick it transfers blah blah
blah but I don't think they're meant to
be like liquid matte lipsticks I think
they're literally just matte glosses
these are so comfortable I find like the
more that you wear them like the longer
you wear throughout the day like they
stay
super comfortable these however I don't
like I don't like them at all these are
the Maybelline vivid matte liquid lips
and these are not matte why are you
lying to me Maybelline you don't dry
matte at all I have a ton of colors and
I just feel like they don't dry down
they stay glossy I'm also not a fan of
these believe it or not these are the
covergirl Oh sugar um lip balms vitamin
infused balm I find that these dried my
lips out is that weird these are
supposed to be like they smell so good
these are kind of like the drugstore
version of the fresh sugar lip
treatments coz you know like they're
sugary and they smell really good but I
don't find that they moisturize my lips
like other lip balms you like aquaphor
from the drugstore that's like three
dollars moisturizes my lips so much more
than this or the Revlon kissable balm
stains I don't know I find other
drugstore lip balms do more for me than
these do we are finally at the end my
last category is miscellaneous because I
didn't exactly know what to name this
category is just random stuff I tried
out the new Maybelline master fix lock
and makeup long-lasting finish I really
really like this I haven't tried the
L'Oreal one but I really like this I do
think it prolongs my makeup I also tried
out this one this is the I guess I could
have done like a setting spray category
this is the wet and wild photo focus
setting spray actually really do like
this one too
I just don't like the scent of this one
like the scent is a little bit strong
but I do like this I think it does do a
good job of setting my makeup I don't
think it like prolongs it for so long
but I like them both I do like them both
this is the Garnier micellar cleansing
water um I keep trying to find something
that I like as much as my Bioderma and I
don't this is not bad if you are looking
for micellar water I do like this one
more than the simple one the simple one
really burned my eyes but I find that my
Bioderma takes off my makeup better than
this one I don't know I just I can't
find anything I like more than Bioderma
Bioderma is my Holy Grail product so I
tried out the wet and wild one step one
or gel nail polishes Holy Grail nail
polishes I feel these are so freakin
good
these lasts forever on my nails and
they're so inexpensive
and then the last product in this video
is something I don't like at all this is
this Maybelline thing it's like a sponge
thing this is so hard and stiff this is
a pure gimmick to me if I were you I
would not waste your money on this this
does not apply your foundation like a
sponge like a good sponge does save your
money and buy yourself the Real
Techniques complexion sponge because
this No
