video and it is it's an epic haul I'm
pretty sure this is the biggest haul I'm
ever gonna do on my channel ever ever I
got a lot of stuff guys I got a lot of
stuff the good thing is that this was
not all purchased in one day this video
is a collective haul these are things
that I've bought pretty much throughout
the whole month of December and now is
when I'm sitting down and filming this
haul because I went shopping yesterday I
had a couple of gift cards from
Christmas and it's a big one I do have a
drugstore as well as high-end so this is
versatile fits everyone's needs I'm
gonna go ahead and get started on the
haul because I don't want this video to
be half an hour long and with all the
crap that I got it's going to be a long
one it's going to be a long one I have
had some of these things for a couple of
weeks but I've only used like I've only
used them like one or two times so yeah
I'm gonna start off with the drugstore
stuff that I got so I picked up four of
the new revlon colorburst matte balms it
took me forever to find these I went to
Walmart teen yes I went everywhere I
finally found some at Target and at
Walmart those were the only places that
had them I picked up the color elusive
which is this really light pink I
thought it was gonna be um more muted
than it came off on my lips on my lips
it's just like a little bit brighter
than I thought but it's still beautiful
and wearable for every day I picked up
Zoey which is like a beautiful loud pink
it's so nice I picked up stand out which
is honestly like the most beautiful red
color I've ever seen in my life and then
I picked up shameless okay
shame list that's what it's called and
it is just a nice deep purple and it's
like very vampy and fall appropriate and
I love it like my favorite one staying
with Revlon I picked up the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation
I haven't wanting this for a really long
time I just never picked it up because I
heard that it wasn't exactly the best
for dry skin but I'm just such a fan of
the original Colorstay foundation
then I wanted to give this a shot and I
have used it twice and I'm obsessed with
it the only thing is that I have to
really really moisturize the living crap
out of my face before I put this on but
when I do moisturize a lot before I use
this my face looks flawless and it looks
even better ten hours later like this
this stuff is the real deal I love it I
picked up two blushes from the drugstore
so I picked up this one from Milani it
is called luminoso luminoso yeah and I'm
sure you guys have seen this color about
a million times it is really popular
here on YouTube and for a good reason
it's like the perfect peachy pink a lot
more peach than anything else and it's
really pretty I think it will look good
on a lot of different skin tones because
I think that this would look especially
good in the summer with a tan and then I
picked up a blush that was a little bit
more scary um you wouldn't think I would
but I picked up NYX cinnamon blush and
it's pretty much orange like on camera
it looks a little bit more pink than it
does in person it's like an orange blush
but every time I see somebody wearing
this it looks absolutely beautiful on
them you just have to lightly put it on
your cheeks and it gives you like a nice
orange look and I love orange makeup
it's my favorite when I was at Walmart I
picked up the hard candy baked bronzer
and Tiki obviously this isn't a bronzer
it's definitely a highlight and I have
been wanting this for so long because
everybody and their grandmother talks
about this saying that it's like the
most beautiful highlight ever and it is
I've used it like twice and I think that
this would look especially good in the
summer because in the winter it's just a
little bit darker than I like my
highlights to be even in the summer this
would look beautiful I think that this
bronzer from Physicians Formula I have
been wanting this bronzer forever and I
just never wanted to pay that much but
at CVS they were doing so many great
deals and if you but like $15 worth of
Physicians Formula you got ten extra
bucks so I decided to give it a go and
it's a beautiful bronzer and it's matte
which you rarely come across matte
the drugstore but it's like a nice it's
not too flat it's like a nice luminous
smack if that makes any sense I also got
these two things from Physicians Formula
because they were 75% off I'm serious
guys go to CVS like right now so many
things are like 75 and 50% off it's
crazy
I got this just because it was 75% off
because I'm not too crazy about it but
it is the baked bronzer in fake tan and
I just think that it would look really
nice in the summer like on top of any
matte bronzer just to give a little bit
more glow because it does have a little
bit of glitter in it which I'm not too
too fond of I'm not a big fan of that
but I do think that this would look nice
in the summer and then I got this
shimmer strip in the color it's called
Miami strip perfect for me this is what
it looks like it's absolutely beautiful
on their own they don't really swatch
that nicely like when you pass your
finger through each individual strip but
when you mix it all together it's like
the most beautiful rose gold it's it's
beautiful and it's not chunky which is
awesome this would be like a beautiful
highlight you know 75% off like yeah
then the last thing I got at the
drugstore were these nail polishes these
this one was 50% off and this one was
75% off this is the Nicole by OPI in the
color back in my glory of days this is
from like the modern family collection
and when I got this beautiful like beige
nude color it's so nice and it's called
walk on the beach and it was 50% off so
it was like insanely cheap oh just
kidding I still have something else from
the drugstore I got these two Jordana
twelve-hour made to last eyes shadow
pencils I got it in the color tenacious
Brown and endless emeralds you can find
Jordana at Walgreens and these things
are no joke I just watch them on my hand
when I first bought them at Walgreens
and they did not come off my hand like
they are no joke they're like glue which
is awesome because it's really
inexpensive and they're really good okay
so I also got a couple of makeup geek
stuff I got them online I picked up the
Li palette that she sells on the website
which isn't from makeup geek but she
says among
and then I got to makeup geek eyeshadows
this is Peach Smoothie and corrupt I
originally wanted to get pigments from
makeup geek but I decided that I didn't
want to just get an empty Z palette so I
just bought two makeup geek eyeshadows
and after using these eyeshadows chances
are I go and buy like the rest of our
shadows because they're really
inexpensive and they are so incredibly
pigmented
so I picked up these three pigments I
got liquid gold utopia and afterglow and
they are so good they're inexpensive I
think I'm like $7 seven or eight dollars
and they are crazy pigmented I use it I
use it I used utopia in my New Year's
Eve makeup tutorial and it's probably my
favorite pigment of all time okay so now
I'm moving on to the high-end portion of
this haul
and first thing I thought was this it
cosmetics blush brush I have been dying
to get the it cosmetics brushes that
they are really expensive but I thought
this one was worth it 100% it for so
it's cute I think it's beautiful it's
like a nice any of this holy crap this
is the softest brush I have ever put on
my face I recommend anything from it
cosmetics they're great I went to the
Mac counter and I got three things from
Mac I picked up this lipstick this is
the sheen supreme lipstick in the colour
agent flower it's a really nice purple
like a light purple e pink eye
I feel like I don't have anything that
looks like this I probably do but I
think it's really nice then I picked up
this eyeshadow that I have been wanting
for a really long time because it
reminds me of Urban Decay's smog and
smog is one of my favorite eyeshadows
this one's called tempting it's just a
really nice rich golden bronze basically
and then I got this blush and it is
called margin starting to get into
blushes more and it's a nice golden e
pink I don't know a gold any pink yeah
PT golden pink so I don't know if this
is in all coals but the other day I was
that cold and I was completely shocked
that they sold the bomb there I thought
that the only place you can get the bomb
was online
the bomb website but no they sell the
bomb at Kohl's
so I picked up the Bahama Mama bronzer
just like this the packaging is really
really cute and it is a deep brown it
doesn't come off orange on your skin
whatsoever it's just a deep matte Brown
like it's the real snow joke it's dark
and then I picked up the Schwing black
liquid eyeliner and I love this eyeliner
so much because it's really easy to work
with
it's a felt tip but it's a flexible felt
tip like it's not completely hard so you
can do like your really really thin line
or a really thick line with it and I
know it dries to a really really really
matte black like I recommend this 1,000%
I picked up the ever-so-popular
Clinique bottom lash mascara you guys
know that my favorite mascara in the
entire world is the cleaning lash
doubling mascara and I've heard so many
people rave about this tiny little
bottom lash mascara and I always thought
that's ridiculous I'm mascara
specifically for your bottom lashes no
ain't nobody got time for that but I
gave it to the hike and I bought it and
I've used it once and the one time that
I used it I fell in love it makes my
bottom lashes look crazy long and just
like this like this like ah makes it
look good then the rest of the stuff I
got at Sephora I picked up the Anastasia
Beverly Hills brow Wiz this is my
favorite brow product in history of the
world and I ran out of mine like months
and months ago and I just never picked
up another one so I got the Broadway's
still trying to get over my cold so I
sound like Kermit the Frog sometimes
anyway I picked up the Urban Decay 24/7
glide-on eye pencil in the color main
line it's like a nice matte teal blue
it's like a blueish teal I don't know I
feel like it's a really unique eyeliner
and it's really smooth and soft and I
love that it's matte I picked up this
really expensive highlighter from Becca
but I really didn't want to pay thirty
eight dollars for this cuz I feel like
that's way too much but it's a beautiful
highlight this is in the color moonstone
they have like four different ones but I
think the packaging is cool
it's like I don't know nothing that
matters but it's like a gorgeous like
moonlit kind of highlight and it looks
so beautiful on the skin I'm not
explaining I think it's worth the money
I really do
it just it's not too over-the-top but
it's not shimmery chunky or glittery
which I hate I hate that in a highlight
if I could describe the perfect
highlight literally perfect it would be
this I got two things from NARS and
believe it or not this is the first time
that I've ever purchased NARS I don't
own any NARS makeup but I got the ever
so famous NARS Laguna bronzer and I
always thought it was just a giant hype
like on art sakuni's the best and I
really didn't think it was anything
crazy but it's gorgeous after I bought
it I have decided this is the most
beautiful bronzer I own it looks so nice
on the skin because it's not orange but
it has like a golden goddess look to it
I cannot explain it it's like not orange
at all so that's a major thumbs up and
it's just it's beautiful it really is
and then I got a little NARS eyeshadow
this is in the color Galapagos when I
saw it at the store I was like oh my god
this the most beautiful eyeshadow ever
see and I need to have it and it's like
so cute oh and it is a nice deep
chocolate brown and you're like oh
really Kathleen you have a million of
those eyeshadows but no he has like a
golden sheen to it there's literally
chunks of golden glitter in there and
it's awesome because when you swatch it
like the glitters don't just fall away
like glitters stay there in the swatch
and gorgeous so unique I love it
I picked up the Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray because I just I've heard
so many people talk about this product
and I don't have a like a setting spray
I use my fix+ and that works fine for me
but I wanted something that would make
my my makeup last all day and I got the
chill one because it's cooling and
hydrating you guys know I got dress kin
so I picked that up and I haven't used
it yet so hopefully it works so my
camera died and I had to charge her for
a little while so if it's a little
darker
that's why okay so last three things I
got from Sephora are eyeshadow palettes
and I know that seems dramatic and it is
it's no need for that but what can you
do
so I finally gave in to the hype and I
picked up the lorac Pro palette and I
have been skeptical about this palette
for so long because I have a no rack
lorac palette and I don't really like it
that much I think that the eyeshadows
are very pigmented at all so I was like
oh this can't be that good but then I
went to the store and I swatch them on
my hands and I was like wow the
pigmentation is crazy so of course
you've seen this a million times just
let's like this and I've used it once
before and I have to say that I'm
obsessed with it
this color right here called light
bronze is my favorite color and it's so
sleek and amazing it's a really good
palette plus it comes with a little
eyeshadow primer that is actually really
really really really good I also picked
up the Kat Von D ladybird palette I've
had my eye on this for a really long
time so I just put the bullet and bought
it I love the packaging of this and the
best part is that well it comes with a
little autograph eyeliner pencil in the
color immortal love it's just a deep
brown color which everybody can use
brown eyeliner and I love this palette
because all the eyeshadows are matte I
love my eyeshadows and this I shot right
here is my absolute favorite because I
love anything that's orange and look at
that super pigmented I'm talking like
all these eyeshadows are crazy pigmented
I love and then the last thing is not
technically a palette but it is the
Smashbox wonder vision I set which I
mean it is a palette because there's a
palette in here but this is in the shade
sparks they have different I don't know
how like two other different colors and
this comes with a full size
Smashbox full exposure mascara it's both
sides this mascara is pretty good I've
used it like once but I mean it's
nothing on this world but it is pretty
good and it comes with an eyeliner in
the color onyx which is just a black
eyeliner so could always use that and
then it comes with the most beautiful
little eye shot
palate in the universe these colors are
right up my alley like they're really
really beautiful
and they are so pigmented like I love
this little thing and it's so compact
them little like it fits anywhere it's
perfect for traveling I'm just I'm
obsessed with it okay so that is the end
of this hall I know it was a lot of
stuff but it was a collective heart I
didn't buy this like all at once so yeah
