another makeup haul asked you guys in a
previous video if you only wanted to see
my IMATS haul or if you wanted to see
all the shopping I did while I was in
California so that is what I'm doing
today I did okay I have to give a little
disclaimer I went to California knowing
that I wanted to shop I only have a
Sephora here that's inside of a JCPenney
and it's tiny so and I know that
California is like filled with beautiful
big Sephora's so I know I wanted to go
shopping besides IMATS
so I did save a lot of money to do this
so I went to Macy's Mac and Sephora and
that's what I'm going to be sharing with
you today and it's a lot it really is
but when our plane landed I had hit
500,000 subscribers and it was it was
amazing I was so happy and also my
birthday is tomorrow
well by the time this video goes up my
birthday would have already passed I
turn 23 tomorrow January 27th so a lot
of this was birthday shopping like Danny
bought me half of this makeup and I just
wanted to you know celebrate my birthday
and half a million subscribers and I
just want to say that I know this is
annoying like okay get on to it get on
with it but I just want to put that out
there it's a lot of stuff but I was
celebrating and besides honestly I
wouldn't even have half of the makeup I
have if it wasn't for my channel I like
to buy things constantly and review new
things and try out new products to share
with you guys really quickly I want to
show you a couple of things I got at the
drugstore I got this nail polish from
L'Oreal and it's amazing it's called
masked affair and Nicole's wearing this
on her nails when she got here and I was
like wow your nail polish is amazing
it's a beautiful dual chrome it looks
better on the nails than it does in the
bottle but if you see masked affair at
your local Walgreens or CVS or anything
pick it up you won't regret it it's
beautiful
I got another Maybelline fit me because
mine is running low it's my favorite
concealer like a whole time well at the
drugstore and then I picked up this I
saw this is the Mabel
a master conceal concealer by face
studio and I love the master line from
Maybelline it's my favorite so I want to
see how this works I hear it's pretty
thick which kind of worries me but I'm
going to try it out and I'll let you
guys know and I also saw these these
have to be new these are the Rimmel lip
Velvets they like show off their in the
same packaging as the like original ones
but these are matte I yeah these are
like the matte versions so I'm really
excited to try this because I didn't
like the original because they smelled
weird but these don't smell that strong
and then I was looking everywhere for
this foundation and my friend Gaby
finally sent it to me because I couldn't
find it anywhere here this is the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless I
am a big fan of the original fit me and
I'm very dry so this is why I like it
but sometimes this is like to Dewey so I
got this to mix them this is like my
summer shade though but I got this to
mix them to get like a perfect satin
finish so I'm really excited I'm
actually wearing this on its own right
now and I really really like it but I do
have to use a hydrating primer so that's
I have a hydrating primer on underneath
and it didn't cling to dry patches like
pretty like that bad so I actually
really like this on its own surprisingly
if I'm hydrated okay now to the stuff I
got this is actually a collective haul
because I did go shopping at Sephora
before I left to California as well so
what's like a two weeks collective haul
oh my god don't hate me so I'm gonna
start off with the stuff I got at Mac I
went a little hand matte Mac because
there was a store by my hotel and I
don't have a mac store here it's just
like a counter at Belk okay so I got
this brush this is the Mac 129 this is
their blush brush I always say that word
wrong blush brush and this is what it
looks like when you wash it it gets like
a little bit more fluffy but I wanted
something I wanted a blush brush and I
have my a cosmetics one that I bet I'm
crazy about but I like that one more for
like shimmery blushes if that makes
sense I wanted I don't know I just
wanted this brush for a while but these
are so expensive like these brushes are
so expensive and sometimes they're a
little scratchy so at the Mac
I went to they had like a little to go
section where they had like travel-size
of a bunch of different things so I got
um these Mac wipes these are 30 sheets
and I love the smell of Mac wipes like I
like them just for the scent that's
weird and I don't know I love these I
picked up those and then I got these
pigments so I got these three pigments
and I usually don't buy Mac pigments
because I will never go through a Mac
pigment and chances are you won't go
through this either but those are 21 and
these little ones are ten dollars I
picked up old gold I've always wanted
this one it's like a greeny
Goldy I know it's good I got vanilla
it's a beautiful like face highlight
like it's nice for your eyes but it's
beautiful on the face and then I got
Kitsch miss yeah kitsch miss it's like a
really pretty purple like silvery purple
speaking of pigments I got this pressed
pigment I have wanted this pressed
pigment forever forever and this is in
the shade jet Couture it's just
basically a really pretty black silvery
sparkly color it looks really beautiful
on top of really dark smokey eyes which
is why I got it
I picked up a mascara this is the Mac
and extreme dimension 3d black lash this
is my favorite Mac mascara it's one of
my favorite mascaras of all time so I
picked up another one even though I
won't be opening this for a while
because I have like four mascaras that
are open right now and I'm gonna wait
till I go through like one of them
before I open this but I love this
mascara you haven't tried it it's good
not the original and extreme dimension
the 3d black lash is the best the last
things I got at Mac were these guys this
is the preparan Prime highlighters and I
didn't know if I wanted light boost or
if I wanted radiant rose so I got both
of them I like pink e'er colors for
underneath my eyes because I feel like
it balances things out any kind of
camouflage is my circles but then I
wanted like the yellow one when I was
more tan like when I'm self-tanning the
other one looks really pretty too so I
know the mope I also wanted to pick
these up
to compare them to the Maybelline Dream
Lumi touch things I want to see if
they're worth the investment or if the
drugstore has better ones I'm just gonna
because I can't deal right now okay so
I'm in lots of things I got at Sephora
when I went they have a huge Sephora
store like in LA humongous humongous so
I picked up a backup of my origins
high-potency vitamins this is my
favorite nighttime moisturizer ever
nothing compares in my opinion this is
what it looks like
I bought a backup because I'm like down
to the wire and they don't sell origins
at my Sephora so I had to get another
one I can't be without this night time
moisturizer I'm just gonna continue with
skin because I did pick up a couple of
skincare things my skin has kind of been
reacting weird I don't know it has to do
with the weather it always has to do
with the weather
January especially my skin hates me so I
decided to pick up a few things just to
change up some things so I got this I
got the small version because I don't
know how good this is but this is the
fresh Seabury moisturizing face oil they
don't have fresh and my Sephora so this
is what it looks like it's just like a
nourishing face oil I got it because um
Jaclyn hill really loves ninety percent
of my purchases are because of Jaclyn
hill so she really loves this and I just
wanted to give it a shot it has omega
three six seven and nine it's a hundred
percent pure moisture with sea buckthorn
oils um I got this I had a sample of
this like two months ago and I really
liked it and didn't buy it but this is
the Murad
skin smoothing polish it is deeply exfol
deeply oaks
deeply exfoliates the leave skin soft
and smooth helps relieve congested pores
I would only use this maybe like once a
week I love to expose exfoliate because
my skin is really dry but this is kind
of like a really intense exfoliator and
I like my st. Ives green tea scrub for
like three times a week but I wanted
something like a little bit more
powerful and I hear really good things
about Murad I got this for during the
day this is the Boscia cool blue
hydration essence
I'm not going to lie that this didn't
really have very great reviews online
but I got it anyway because I follow
somebody here on YouTube Ilana she's
beautiful like beautiful and she said
that she loves this because it looks
good underneath makeup and that it takes
away her redness instantly and I have
that problem in the morning like my face
was super red and she said that it's
like instant it takes away redness
instantly so I bought it and I'm hoping
it's good it was promotions a pretty
expensive brand but I'm the kind of
person that if you're gonna invest in
something invest in skincare because I
mean your skin is so important it's your
skin you know so I hope that this really
minimizes my redness and helps you know
hydrated during the day I also got this
this is pretty new to Sephora and I got
this before California and Olivia at
Sephora hello Olivia if you're watching
this - Colleen ah but she's a really
sweet girl that always talks to me at
Sephora she told me that she tried this
and it was really really amazing this is
from the brand all Genest
and it is the genius ultimate anti-aging
melting cleanser sounds really cool this
is I've never tried it
a new breakthrough cleanser with a
transforming texture so this is really
cool so when you first put it on your
face it's a gel it's like a gel
consistency you put it all over your
face and as you're mixing it into your
face like trying to take off your makeup
and wash your face it transforms into an
oil so like an oil it breaks down this
is what you know it claims and what
Olivia was telling me it breaks down all
your oil like mascara it breaks it all
down and then like when you add water it
turns into a milk like a milky
consistency so it says it has phase one
gel phase two oil phase three milk so
I'm really really excited to try this it
says melt away makeup oil and impurities
leave skin perfectly cleansed and
radiant replenishes nourishes brightens
and smooth paraben free and sulfate free
and then when I was like up at the
registers you know that section that
always like gets you I saw this and I
have always wanted to try this guy right
here it's a little pricey but when I saw
this that I had three like mini versions
I was like okay it's tough
any worth checking that out this is the
Ola Henrickson three little wonders kit
and it comes with the truth serum this
is the thing I wanted to try it's the
collagen booster potent vitamin C
complex I wanted to put vitamin C on my
face for a while and then it comes with
the invigorating night treatment and
there shear transformation channel
strength anti-aging AM and PM system
okay and that is the last didn't carry
item I got this is kind of skincare I
know I just
I bought these Mac wipes but I have
always wanted to try the Josie Maran
Bayer Josie Maran Barenaked lights they
smell really good I haven't opened my
mic ones because I'm using this they
smell really good and I wanted to give
this a go because my simple ones I
already like writing other simple ones
so I wanted to try these because I've
heard good things and I don't think I
like them more than my simple ones my
simple and dry lo Mart like inexpensive
and I think my sub bones are better but
these do smell nice so I mean I guess I
I don't know if I will repurchase that
to be honest okay so I got so excited
you guys have no idea
I bought this makeup forever artist eye
shadow I bought one and I was so happy
when I saw this in California like at
the Sephora this was the last one they
had this specific shade has been sold
out at Sephora calm for months I can
never get a hold of this shape and
finally it was just sitting there
waiting for me
the last one at Sephora they never have
it at my Sephora either but yes this is
M nine to eight it's just like the most
beautiful purple ever it's matte and it
has like a plum eNOS to it I don't know
it's really beautiful I have been
wanting this and I got my hands on it so
I got this before I left to California
honestly I got it because of what it's
called but this is the Too Faced
soulmates blushing bronzer this is like
a new thing that two-faced came up with
for their spring collection and some
it's an addition and this is what it
looks like it's gorgeous
this is the cutest packaging I've ever
seen it reminds me of Polly Pocket if
any of you guys remember
Polly Pocket was it just reminds me a
potluck Polly Pocket and this is what it
looks like on the inside it's huge I
thought it was going to be a lot smaller
than this it is huge
it's a blushing bronzer so it has the
bronzer and then it has the blush here
whoo honestly it's like a little warm
it's a matte bronzer but it's like very
orange II which is not typically my
favorite but when I mix it in with the
blush part here it makes it like a pinky
orange so it looks nice like for a blush
and it would also look really pretty
during the summer time but the reason
why I bought this is because this is
called Ross and Rachel the name of this
product is called the Ross and Rachel
and if you know me you know that friends
is my all-time favorite show and they're
like on friends Ross and Rachel so they
have two of them this one that's called
Ross and Rachel and another one that's
like for lighter skin tones and it's
called Carrie and big this was an
impulse buy I was not planning on buying
this at all at all I don't know why I
got it I mean I love it but I'm gonna
lie about it this is whoa this is the
hourglass and being ambient lighting
palette now I don't have any of the
hourglass powders that everyone raised
about I'm telling you everyone raves
about these powders everyone and I don't
have any of them and I decided that I
really wanted to try one so I just
picked up the palette instead because I
feel like it's a better value so it
comes with dim light incandescent light
and radiant light but I hear that these
powders are like wonderful I've never
been interested in interested in them at
all
but so much hype around something you
feel like you need to buy it just to see
if the hype is real so I haven't tried
it yet and I hope the hype is real cuz -
suspense okay so two more things I got
from bite Beauty I've never tried any of
their lip glosses ever and my beauty is
such a good brand like made with real
fruit these glasses are made with real
fruits so I got two of them just to try
it I got rambutan rambutan yeah every
time I read this I think of Rasputin I
don't want to call it Rasputin which is
the bad guy in Anastasia if you guys
know have you ever seen Anastasia
Rasputin is the bad guy is it really
pretty
like peachy gloss and I like these
because they smell really good they
honestly smell like real fruit which is
amazing and they're not very sticky they
have a little a little stick to them but
it's not something I can't deal with so
I got Rasputin and then I got Coco which
is my favorite it's a really pretty
neutral moth like a really light neutral
Moffitt I think it would look good just
on its own or on top of anything so okay
and then we're done with Sephora just
going to show you two more things and
then I just got a couple of things at
Macy's
so I've heard so much hype about the
ardency in brand and they're very pricey
brand so I never really looked at them
but I have heard dusty and Jacqueline
Hale both love their monster smooth ride
supercharged eyeliners so I picked one
up this one is in the shade coffee and
it's a very warm brown so I picked it up
and it's nice I'm wearing in my
waterline right now
and it really lasts in the waterline and
they're very creamy like look at this
like nothing like creamy and they don't
budge like when i swatched it on my hand
that's a four oh and I was walking
around Sephora and I tried to take it
off my hand it didn't go anywhere so
that's saying something
and then I got this and I was blown away
blown away this is their manuka honey
enriched pigments from ardency in this
is what they look like they just look
like basic little eyeshadows right
beautiful eyeshadows but these pop right
out in the pan so you can put this in a
Z palette or just put it right back in
the eyeshadow these are no joke like
real pressed pigments this is what I
have on my eyelids today this is the
only thing I have on my eyelids and then
I have a bronzer in the crease it's in
the shade rose gold I might love this
just as much as I love my Mac amber
light eyeshadow I'm like blown away if
you don't want to invest the money the
makeup geek foiled eyeshadows are very
similar to this and
they're like half the price but if you
have been wanting to try this and if
you're wondering if it's worth the hype
it absolutely is
I will be Reaper Oh be careful
I will be repurchasing just a couple
more colors that I saw that I really
loved okay and then I got a couple of
things at Macy's actually this is not
from Macy's I went to the mall with my
friend Jessie and um they have a body
shop in California I have a body shop
here too but they don't sell makeup at
the bunch up here they sell the body
shop makeup and the store that I went to
in California so of course I had to pick
this up this is the body shop um
bronzing powder in light matte this is
what it looks like it's very very light
you know I wanted it on days where I'm
not really wearing makeup
and honestly I'm purchased this because
I see button raves about this it's like
one of her favorite bronzers because
it's very natural so that's why I bought
it I don't know why for some reason I
thought it would smell like honey it
does not but it looks like a little
honeycomb and it is like a very soft
very very very light color so if you are
a super fair I think you would really
like this and then I got this this is
the body shop radiant highlighter it's
just like a pinky pearly highlighter
really really pretty to use like mixed
with a foundation under foundation on
the high points of the face so yeah okay
so I only have three more things this
video is so long I have three more
things to share with you guys and I got
these at Macy's the day before I met so
if you guys saw my IMATS haul Namie's
was an iMac and Bobbi Brown was 40% off
and I got a shimmer brick in the shade
bronze but the day before I bought this
shimmer brick at Macy's for full price
but this in the shade pink quartz this
is the most beautiful highlight ever and
I'm someone that thinks that Physicians
Formula shimmer strips are just as good
that's why I wanted to buy these I
wanted to see if you know it was worth
investing and sure they're really
beautiful but Physicians Formula for
like $14 they're just as good but this
one in pink quartz I don't do pink
highlighters I like either gold or like
bronzy highlighters or white-ish
highlighters but this one is amazing
it's a beautiful beautiful bronzy pink
oh my god this just looks so gorgeous
this is a highlight I'm wearing on my
face today and I'm someone who doesn't
love pink highlighters and I love this
and then these two last products are so
unlike me okay please guys don't hate me
don't throw things at me but I was
looking at the stuff I went to the
Chanel counter and I was looking at this
stuff and everything I would touch I
would kind of look at the price and then
put it back you know and I'm you guys
know I'm always someone who's like I
don't buy a YSL I don't bite your I
don't buy you know I don't charge our
money no I don't do that I just don't I
have wanted the luminous silk foundation
or something like that forever but I
will not spend $70 on a foundation um
like on one single foundation that's
crazy because my Revlon Colorstay is
like 12 and I love it so but I have
wanted to try these two Chanel products
for a really long time a really long
time so I picked up the limp Blanc de
Chanel I picked it up and I was gonna
put it back in ten he's like just get it
so Danny bought it for me because I
wasn't gonna get it so he bought me this
this is the lib Blanc de Chanel it's
their base Lumiere it's the primer I
bought this because Jacqueline Hill
raves about this she says it's like her
all-time favorite primer and usually I
love what she recommends I love luma
nating primers I haven't used it yet but
it's like a whitish like luminizing
primer and I hope it's as good as she
says it is and honestly when I saw the
price I was kind of surprised because
this is a $45 primer but you would think
it being Chanel it would be a lot more
expensive like the hourglass one is 52
and like the Laura Mercier prior and
like the Laura Mercier primer and like
the Laura Mercier primers are just as
much so for Chanel it's I was like wow I
mean 45 is it expensive but for Chanel I
was expecting like 60 I was pretty
pleasantly surprised I didn't buy it
Dani had to get it from me because I was
not but yeah and then I got this I got
this because I saw makeup by Tiffany D
used to talk about this all the time and
I always wanted to try it but I never
did this is the sole a 10-day Chanel I'm
like a bronzer Fein I have way too many
this is the bronze Universal and look
how beautiful this is a bronzer so
beautiful this is what it looks like it
looks like just a whipped bronzer
it's gorgeous it's like 48 dollars which
is redic Danny also bought this for me
just let you know I was not gonna spend
$40 on a brothel but even though I've
spent like 45 on Laguna coz Laguna is is
that how much that is whatever
it's a beautiful bronzer I haven't used
it on myself yet if I like want to
cherish it forever but it's beautiful it
will last forever because it's just so
huge and yeah I've heard good things I
have these Sonia Kashuk bronzer and I
want to compare them to see if maybe
they're dupes you know I want to do like
a dupe video in the future that's why I
want to try like high and low and I want
to like you know be a big book of makeup
knowledge okay guys so that was
everything I got I know ridiculous but I
was celebrating my birthday and 500 K so
I mean I'm on a no buy it by the way
after this I'm on a I'm on a no buy you
might not see a haul for me in a while
actually I might have a drugstore haul
coming up soon but after that I'm on a
serious no bye thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
