my hair care routine using REO geo
products you guys know I've been using
this brand for a really long time so I
am so excited to announce that today's
video is actually sponsored by REO geo
which is so amazing I love this brand
and whenever I want to do my hair like
naturally curly and just let it do its
thing I mainly use Brio Gio products I
mean you guys know I use a ton of
different brands here on my channel but
brioche yo is that brand I always go
back to I always use no matter what I'm
doing to my hair straight curly it's
always in my routine but when I do leave
my hair natural I mainly use Brio Gio so
that is what today's videos gonna be
about and I'm just gonna explain how I
use everything why I love everything and
how I get my hair like this which I mean
this is pretty much natural hair but I
do use some products to keep it this way
because my hair naturally without adding
any products in it it's very frizzy very
puffy before I get started though I do
what I mentioned brioche Ile did give me
a coupon code for you guys it's not like
an affiliate code or anything but they
thought it would be nice to give my
subscribers a little something so
they're giving you guys 20% off on the
brioche Gio website like on all orders
if you use the discount code cathleen
that'll save you some money if you have
been looking into some brioche EO stuff
so I will have that linked down below
but without further ado let's get
started
I am constantly switching up my shampoo
but I did want to mention the brioche
euros dark over a pair shampoo is really
good if you're looking for a shampoo
that's silicon free that is a major
thing for me whenever I wear my hair
naturally curly I hate using products
with silicon in it not because it's
necessarily bad for you but it just
coats your hair and it kind of gives you
the illusion of soft hair
I like the rose Arco products because
they really penetrate the hair they
moisturize the hair and it's silicone
free sulfate free paraben free free of
all the bad stuff so this one's pretty
good and I use it from time to time but
I have completely fallen in love with
their scalp revival shampoo this stuff
is so good it is their charcoal and
coconut oil micro exfoliating shampoo
it's also sulfate free paraben free
silicone free I mean all of the brioche
oil products are free of all that stuff
which is the main reason why I love this
so much all their products are like 90%
natural and have a really great
ingredients this is an exfoliating
shampoo but I don't want that to scare
you it's not rough on the scalp but it
just gives you a nice deep clean I don't
know about you guys but I use a lot of
dry shampoo dry shampoo I don't wash my
hair that often I wash it maybe once or
twice a week washing my hair too often
dries out my hair so I've been using
this every other time I wash my hair and
it's great because it has coconut oil
which is amazing for your hair and the
exfoliator zin this are actually
vegetable base which is pretty cool
because it gives you a very gentle
exfoliation
it also has tea tree oil in it which I
really like because it soothes the skin
on your head and it kind of helps with
itchiness and irritation if you're
someone who suffers from like dandruff
or really itchy scalp I think you might
like the fact that this has tea tree oil
in it and then of course the charcoal in
this product is with really like
detoxify as your head it gets rid of all
the builds up and the gunk and the
impurities and all that stuff so this is
incredible I highly recommend this and
the way that I use it I will get in the
shower and I'll just scoop some in the
palm of my hand I have a lot of hair you
know my hair is very long so I do use
quite a bit of this but a little does go
a long way you don't need to use so much
but one handful is enough for my head
and I really work this product into my
hair and make sure that I'm getting my
fingers all up in my head I'm scratching
my head I'm really working this product
into my scalp to get rid of all the gunk
and as you can see I'm mainly focused
this at the crown of my head but I'll
take a bit of this shampoo and kind of
run it through the rest of my hair just
to clean my hair a little bit I don't
focus this too much on my ends mainly
focus this at the crown of my head so
I'll just do that for a while and once I
feel like my entire head is coated in
this good stuff I will just rinse it out
with water and you could immediately
feel all that build-up is just
completely gone and then after that it's
key to conditioning your hair
obviously you want to do shampoo and
then conditioner I rarely ever use
conditioner I don't remember the last
time I use the conditioner it's been a
while but because I don't wash my hair
everyday I like to use hair masks in
place of my conditioner if you're
someone who washes your hair every
single day I think a hair mask everyday
might be a little bit too heavy on your
hair it might weigh your hair down a bit
but since I don't wash my hair that
often every single time I condition
my hair I use a hair mask and this has
to be my favorite hair mask ever and I'm
not just saying that because this video
sponsored because if you go back to my
videos where I talk about this don't
despair repair mask for this brand even
knew who the heck I was I have been
loving this mask it is so hard to find a
deep conditioning mask that doesn't have
silicone there's only a handful that I
truly love and this is one of them most
hair masks have silicones in them
because it's silicone just makes your
hair feel so soft but this makes your
hair feel just as soft without the
silicones so that's amazing I love it I
also take quite a bit of this product as
well I'm not gonna lie I use more of
this than I do of the shampoo but I
really just work this into my ends I
apply this from like my ears down I
never touch my scalp with this product
and I really just work it into my hair
with my fingers to make sure everything
is nice and evenly distributed and then
once I've done that once I have
saturated my hair with the don't despair
repair deep conditioning mask I will
just pick up my hair and kind of like a
low ponytail and I will let this mask
sit in my hair for about 5 to 10 minutes
it depends what I'm doing in the shower
I will try to drag it on a little bit
longer than 5 minutes and I'll just do
other things in the shower I will wash
my face I will wash my body I'll shave
you know I'll do other things while this
hair mask is sitting in my hair and then
around 10 minutes later I will rinse
this out of my hair and my hair
instantly feels so incredibly soft I
mean this hair mask has a lot of great
ingredients you have avocado sweet
almond and argan oil b5 biotin it has a
ton of great things for the hair and
then while I'm still in the shower I
will brush my hair I prefer to brush my
hair in the shower just because I have a
wet brush and it's just so easy to
detangle my hair and plus with this hair
mask my hair gets detangled almost
immediately and after I'm done brushing
my hair I like to bring a little bit
more life back to my hair because if you
have curly hair you know once you brush
your hair the curls kind of die a little
bit so while I'm still in the shower I
like to judge my hair up a bit once I
get out of the shower is when I use this
bad boy this is a Holy Grail product for
me I use it no matter what I'm doing to
my hair curly straight I I'm constantly
using this I'm pretty sure this is my
fourth bottle already this is the rose
Arco milk reparative leave
conditioning spray I really love this
spray on this a lot of the time leave-in
conditioners have like the worst spray
nozzles you kind of get like chunks of
cream in your hair when you try to spray
it out but with this one the sprays
awesome it doesn't weigh my hair down or
leave it feeling really greasy it just
absorbs right into the hair while
nourishing and hydrating the hair it has
rosehip oil argan oil and coconut oil
which is why it's called the rose Arco
milk it also has a vitamin E that's
supposed to combat dryness and restore
shine I pretty much apply this
everywhere I put this all over my head I
spray this sucker all over the place and
it really is amazing
definitely check it out at this point if
I were going to iron my hair I would
kind of stop here probably put my oil in
or something like that but whenever I do
my hair like this where it's like
naturally like this I will go in with
these two products from their curl
charisma line this is the rice amino and
avocado leave-in detangling cream and
this is the rice amino and quinoa frizz
control gel this one I use it kind of in
the same way as I use this but this one
is heavier this one is very lightweight
this one has a little bit more thickness
to it and even though it's a detangling
cream I don't really use it for that I
like to work this into my hair to really
help with the frizz I mainly focus this
on the ends of my hair at the very
bottom and then I'll start working my
way up especially your on my bangs I
feel like my bangs get extremely frizzy
and this cream does help a lot and it
really does a great job of enhancing
your curls once your hair is already dry
I notice a difference when I have my
hair curly and I don't use this leave-in
cream but I'll go in with a little bit
of this and now just kind of like leave
my bathroom and do other things and I'll
wait for my hair to get a little bit dry
not too much I still want my hair to be
damp but I don't want it to be soaked
like it usually is when I'm applying
these other products but once my hair
has dried a little bit then I will go in
with the curl charisma rice amino and
quinoa frizz control Jo this one is also
really good to control frizz I like this
Jo because it's not sticky I really
dislike gels that make your hair really
crunchy and really sticky and the gels
that just make you feel like you have a
lot of product in your hair
those drive me crazy this one does not
do
and I'll just sit there and start
crunching my hair up making sure my hair
stays nice and curly and it just depends
how much gel you want in your hair I
don't apply it too much but I do apply
quite a bit and then once I'm done
applying this I just go about my day and
that's it this is what it does to my
hair once it is dry if I didn't use any
of these products my hair would be like
this big right now so yeah guys I think
that is everything I really just wanted
to share with you how I get my hair
looking like this without it looking
like a giant puffy and I hope if you
were looking into Brio geo this video
kind of helped you a bit I hope you guys
will check them out but yeah guys that
completes this video thank you guys so
