tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I kind of wanted to do a video where
I used neon bright colors in a wearable
way it's an extremely extremely easy
makeup look and I'm very very excited
for this video because this video is
sponsored by benefit which is exciting
because I love benefit and in today's
video I'm gonna be using their
cheekathon palette this is their blush
kit and it's really really nice because
you get five full-size products in this
palette and even though this is a blush
kit you still get a nice bronzer in
there as well so it comes with a rocket
or blush which is probably my favorite
benefit blush of all time I love it
hoola bronzer dandelion blush coralista
blush and Dallas blush slash bronzer I
feel like this one could be both you
also get the little brush that comes in
all of their box powders I really love
that they put this in the kit because
it's perfect to contour with dip it in
simpler contour a little bit this
palette retails for $58 but everything
in here is full-size so the value is
actually a hundred and forty five
dollars like if you were to buy all of
these products separately it would be
like a hundred and forty five bucks but
you can save some moolah and get this
kit for 58 which is awesome so I will
link this product in the description box
below in case you want to check it out I
love it and if you want to see how to
get this fun wearable neon glowy springy
cool look then just keep watching so
before I get into the tutorial I wanted
to show you guys some behind-the-scenes
footage of my photo shoot with benefit I
did it with Patrick and mani and I had
so much fun as so many of you guys know
we are now on like display at Sephora in
the benefits section so many of you guys
have been sending
in front of the benefit display it's so
cool I had such a good time honestly it
was one of the best experiences of my
life being able to sit here with Patrick
and Manny and just shoot pictures and
have such a good time it was a great
experience I don't know it was it was
deeper than cheekathon for me it was
like amazing thank you guys for all the
support and the kind words you've been
sending I love you guys so much honestly
this was amazing like a great experience
and I wanted to show you guys a little
bit of that so I hope you guys enjoyed
these little clips but yes let's get
into the tutorial now so to start off
this look I'm going in with my glossy a
priming moisturizer it's a very very
hydrating a primer I love it now I'm
going in with foundation this is the
Kiko universal fit hydrating foundation
I'm putting this on with my pure sponge
I love this foundation it's not too dewy
but it's not matte either it's like a
perfect blend perfect in between now I'm
going to go in with some concealer this
is the Catrice waterproof liquid
camouflage concealer I love this
concealer it's full coverage and I
really really like how it blends out it
blends effortlessly so I'm just blending
that in with the same sponge I applied
with my foundation now I'm going to just
add a little bit of something underneath
the eyes to highlight a bit
this is dandelion shy beam it's like a
matte pinky highlight so it's perfect to
brighten up the under eyes I'm going to
set that concealer down using my RCM a
no color powder I'm also going to set my
eyelids because I did use that concealer
kind of like a primer for the eyeshadow
so I'm just sitting down everywhere I
put some concealer now I'm going into
the benefit cheekathon palette I'm going
to take this little benefit bamboo brush
and I'm gonna dip it into hoola and I'm
just gonna bronze up the skin with this
brush I'm gonna go in and contour in a
second but I'm just using this brush to
lightly apply some hoola all over the
face now I'm going to take the little
contour brush in the kit and
going to start to contour with this
brush and then I'm going to flip it on
its side to kind of blend everything out
for blush I'm going to mix two shades
together I'm going to take the coralista
blush and rocket or I really like the
combo of these two blushes and I'm going
to apply these to my cheeks
now I'm going to highlight my face using
the makeup revolution shimmer brick in
the shade radiant it's a very intense
highlight as you can see very intense
take your time to blend this out but it
is very very beautiful and very
affordable I love it so to set all those
powders down I just took my pixie milky
hydrating mist and sprayed that all over
my face and now I'm going to move on to
my eyes first I'm going to take makeup
geeks Peach Smoothie eye shadow I'm
going to use this as a transition shade
I love the warm peachy color in this eye
shadow amazing I love it now I'm going
to go in with Poppy also by makeup geek
I'm using all makeup geek eyeshadows in
today's tutorial and I'm going to start
slowly dragging this color into the
crease
I want it concentrated on the outer
corners of my eyes and in my crease as
well so I'm just taking that on a nice
fluffy blending brush and blending that
in next I took makeup geeks mocha and
I'm applying this only on the outer
corners just to add a little bit of
depth I wanted a color that was a little
bit deeper and more natural so I took a
dark brown just to balance balance
everything out then I took I'm peach
List this is a dual chrome eyes shadow
and I'm applying this to the inner
corners and a little bit like on the top
and bottom like inner half there just to
brighten and highlight those sections
and for underneath my brow bone and I
didn't want something too shimmery so I
took white lies which is a nice matte
vibrant white so for the lower lash line
I'm just taking Peach Smoothie on a
pencil brush I'm pretty much putting
this everywhere buffing that right in my
lower lash line and then I'm taking this
amazing color pop eyeliner in the shade
puppy so neon so intensely orange it's
amazing I'm putting that on my waterline
and then to blend things out a little
bit I'm taking papi and blending it
really really close to the eyeliner just
so that everything you know there's no
harsh lines or anything
then I took Peach Smoothie one more time
and blended the crap out of papi and
yeah then I curled my lashes this was
before I burned off my eyelashes on that
eye
yes this video was pre-recorded before I
did that and I'm looking at my eyelashes
and I'm getting a little sad but you
know what
it's just eyelashes let's move on I'm
applying benifits roller lash and then
to finish off this look I'm just
applying my lip color this is over a
long lasting liquid lipstick in the
shade so Paulo but I didn't want a matte
finish I wanted something a little bit
glossy so on top of that I took the NYX
sugar pie lip gloss and just put that
right on top and then that completes
this video I hope you guys enjoyed this
