tutorial on the hook I'm wearing right
now it is a pinky orange II yellowy
sunset kind of eye look I want to do a
look inspired by my entire summer
collection so this is lick number two I
recently did a look surrounding Porter
Miami and m.i.a inspired this one I know
it's not exactly the same but the hot
pink in the electric palette really
reminded me of this nail polish so I
decided to go with like a hot pink
sunset eye and I think it matches really
well with these nails and I'm sorry but
I'm using a bunch of random colors today
I'm using the electric palette I'm using
an eyeshadow in this BH Cosmetics take
me to Brazil palette I'm even using a
single eyeshadow from sugarpill
and so sorry it's just it's really hard
to find all of these colors in one
palette so I'm using a ton of different
shades but use whatever you have at home
I know I'm going to get comments telling
me that this lipstick washes me out but
I thought it looked so cool paired with
this eye it's a little muted and it's a
little concealer looking but I think
it's cool it's different for me oh and
by the way this video was a struggle let
me tell you I feel like I struggled
throughout this entire video things were
not working out for me so hopefully
while editing I could try to make this
video work because well I was doing my
face makeup I was gonna scream my
bronzer looks choppy and please bear
with me but anyway enough to chest if
you want to see how to get this makeup
look then just keep watching okay so my
eyes are already primed and ready to go
I'm going to take the color pop single
shadow in running late and this is kind
of like an orange creamsicle shade and
I'm just going to buff this into my
crease and this is going to help all the
other colors blend better in my crease
now I'm taking the Urban Decay electric
palette and I'm going to take the shade
of savage and I know that this palette
is no longer available but just a hot
pink will work and I'm applying this to
my entire lid I'm taking this right up
to the crease okay so now I'm going to
jump into this take me back to Brazil I
shadow palette it's from BH Cosmetics
and I'm going to take this hot vibrant
orange it's not the most like it's not
super pigmented it's good but it's not
like the best orange in the world so I
did have to work with it a little bit
I'm going back and forth with this
shadow and I'm kind of sandwich this
right into my crease because I want the
color to go from pink to orange to
yellow and kind of like have it fade
really gracefully or at least I dry so
I'm working this color into my crease
and really blending those two colors
together and then I'm slowly going to
start dragging it up so it fades nicely
I'm going back into that hot pink just
to intensify that lid shade because you
know a lot of the shadow just gets
blended away when you're doing so much
crease blending so I'm just going to
intensify that a couple times throughout
this video
now I'm going to take a vibrant yellow
this is butter cupcake from sugarpill
it's one of their single shadows I love
it and on a smaller crease brush I'm
going to apply this directly on top of
the orange but a little bit higher so
that it looks like a nice gradient like
from the pink to the orange to the
yellow like a beautiful pink sunset and
I am just meshing all those colors
together and this one I'm dragging it up
pretty high I'm just leaving a little
space underneath my brow bone because I
want it to be like all over the lid all
the way up to the top so this part does
take me a little bit longer but just
keep blending until you can't blend any
more okay so to highlight underneath my
brow bone I'm going to take this Milani
single shadow in Bella ivory and I'm
just using this like a scent to
highlight the problem I'm going to take
the Marc Jacobs eyeliner gel crayon in
the shade blacker and I'm using this to
tight line and then oh my gosh this was
a struggle guys you have no idea this is
the M cosmetics brush tip illustrative
eyeliner and I love this but my hand was
so shaky from the coffee I drank that my
wing liner it just was not working so I
attempted my best but please forgive me
it does not look very cute it was it was
a struggle and this eyeliner is matte
unless you go over it a hundred times
like I did and then it creates kind of
like a shiny film not film but like it
does look shiny if you go over it too
many times and that's what I did so
anyway I primed my skin with my backup
primer that I love and then I mixed
these two foundations together the wet
and wild one and my number seven list
and luminate one I love the combo of
these two together because one is more
matte and one is more dewy so it creates
like a nice satin finish and for
concealer I'm going in with my NARS fast
fast
what is the fast soft matte complete
concealer brush and I am concealing my
dark circles with this product it's very
full coverage and little goes a long way
and I love this concealer very much but
I'm also highlighting the rest of my
face with it and between my brows on my
nose
my chin just so everything looks nice
and even okay so to set my under eye
concealer I'm taking my RMS beauty
uncover or unpowered unpowered powder
and I'm just setting down the concealer
and now we can move on and finish up the
eyes so I took the Marc Jacobs eyeliner
again and I applied that to my waterline
and then I'm going to take all three
shades that I used on me on my eyes I'm
a PI right now oh my gosh I'm going to
take the three shades I use on my eyes
and I'm applying them to my lower lash
line but like in the opposite order so I
did yellow first and I dragged the
yellow down a little bit more than I did
orange and I did it a little bit more
precisely and then on a small small
little pencil brush
I took the pink shade and I made that
one even more precise like closer to the
waterline so you kind of see a gradient
from pink to yellow kind of a little bit
but it's a little deeper a little smoky
err and yeah I kind of intensified my
waterline because I did cover it with a
lot of those eye shadows but I forgot to
film that part and then to highlight my
inner corners I used the cap on the
thunderstruck eyeshadow and then I went
in with mascara and I was actually going
to leave it like this but I thought you
know what I'm going to apply just a
little bit something so I took my kiss
single falsies well they're not singles
they're kind of like three they have
like three little knots in them and I
just applied a couple of those to my
eyes just to give myself a little bit of
them because I didn't want falsies but I
didn't want just mascara and now comes
the terrible part I don't know what I
did I don't know if I scratched my face
you can see like on my left side of my
face I have like a scratch or something
I don't know how I did that but this
bronzer just like didn't work for me
this is the number seven bronzer in
caramel and it's just too light for my
skin tone so I went in with this girl on
terracotta bronzer it's one of their
newer bronzers just to deepen up the
bronze a little more because I was
blending that number seven one for like
20 minutes and it wasn't intensifying
the color much it was like a little bit
too light for me and then it gets even
worse okay so this is my key Kohl blush
I actually love this blush it's in the
shade 100 and I don't
if I like stamped my face wrong like
look at this you see that right next to
my mouth there's like a giant Kiko blush
stamp like for it's not supposed to be
so I did my best to clean it up Here I
am struggling to clean my face because
the bronzer look choppy the blush looks
choppy it was it was a hot mess but I
didn't want to redo the video so I'm
just baking and trying to fix the
situation and then I went in with this
Tiki highlight by heart candy and I
remember this being so blinding and like
mine was broken I just recently bought
this again and it's like not
highlighting I don't know mine is very
dull and I remember this being like a
super intense not intense but like a
really beautiful highlight my nose was
like not working filming anyway I
thought my face was looking a little bit
powdery so I took some morphe setting
spray just to melt all the powders into
my skin and then I intensified my
highlight just a little bit more with
the Charlotte silvery highlight in the
film star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and then to
finish off this look I'm going in with
the dose of colors liquid lipstick in
the shades and I know concealer lips but
I think it's pretty cool and then I went
over it with the NYX mega shine lip
gloss in the shade frosted beige so that
completes this video guys thank you so

you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
