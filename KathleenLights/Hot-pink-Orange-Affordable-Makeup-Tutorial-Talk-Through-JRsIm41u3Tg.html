through makeup tutorial on this look I
wanted to play around with color in a
really simple way so this is what I came
up with
I love how orange and pink look together
I love that combination I always have
and I just think this look is pretty fun
for the summer time I'm also using all
affordable makeup so I hope you guys
enjoy it and if you want to see how to
get this look then just keep watching
okay so to start out I'm going to use my
Catrice liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer I'm actually going to be using
this as an eyeshadow primer Tuesday I
use concealer as eye primer all the time
and it does increase but like for
example my sister can't do that because
she has super oily eyelids and concealer
will crease on her so just use any
eyeshadow primer that works for you I
have to use something with color to it
or like a base to it so that it can
cover up all my veins this concealer has
like a matte finish so I'm not going to
set it I'm going to take a little bit of
scotch tape and I'm first going to take
it off I put it on the back of my hand
so it doesn't pull out my skin and I'm
just going to line it up this is going
to create kind of like a sharp edge I'm
going to take this light peachy orange
eyeshadow this is Peach Smoothie by
makeup geek and on a fluffy blending
brush this is a Sephora Pro crease brush
I'm going to pop this into my crease and
I'm really going to pack this on this is
the only eye shadow going on my lid
besides my brow bone shade I'm starting
from the tape and then dragging it into
the crease
I want a lot of this color so I'm just
like really building that
I'm going to take ice queen also from
makeup geek amazingness as my brow bone
highlight it's just a white shimmery
shade now I'm going to take the color
pop cream gel color in the shade puppy I
really really struggle with the pots
when they're neon colors like no matter
what brand it is neon gel eyeliners in
the pot are a little bit difficult to
work with I love the eyeliner in puppy
it's like my favorite orange eyeliner
but the pot is a little hard to work
with I'm going to use my Anastacio
number 15 brush and I'm going to create
a wing I'm going to use the tape as my
guideline I'm first going to do kind of
like a thinner line and then I'll
connect the wing
I feel like my skin color kind of peeks
through a lot with this specific
eyeliner so I'm going to take this eye
shadow this is a morphe eyeshadow it
just says number 30 I'm not sure what
the exact name is but it's a really
pretty bright orange color I'm going to
use my Lexie two-to-one brush and I'm
just going to go over that same eyeliner
with this color
and now I'm going to to the VA and you
have a really nice sharp little wing you
could obviously do it as thick or as
skinny as you want but now I'm going to
do my face makeup really quick before
the finish up the eyes for a primer I'm
going to use of course my NYX angel
primer I use this primer all the time it
just smooths out the skin it kind of
fills in your pores but it doesn't feel
like silicone II I probably has some
silicones in it but it doesn't feel too
silicone II it's just great to even out
your skin texture but you guys probably
already know that because I've talked
about this a hundred times
the foundation I'm going to use today is
the Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation in the shade 120 I want my
skin to have kind of like a matte finish
so even though this isn't like a flat
matte foundation it's not dewy which is
what I want and I'm just going to bounce
that in with a Beauty Blender if you
don't want to buy the Beauty Blender
there are a ton of other sponges that
are much more affordable the Real
Techniques one is one you can get at
Ulta and it's really really good quality
Emelia I can't answer I totally need a
facial so bad I have ever since I did
like my makeup geek photoshoot I have
been breaking out on my forehead
and like it's not going away I mean it's
gone away a lot but it's not going away
I'm going to use the same concealer I
use to prime my eyelid my bun is like
the Catrice high coverage camouflage
concealer I really really despise the
scent of this concealer but it's just so
good so I continue to use it
it smells like baby powder but like on
an insane level the only thing with this
concealer is that it dries really
quickly so sometimes I struggle to do
the other eye after I've spent so much
time on this one I have to like pounds
fast okay so I'm actually gonna finish
up my eyes before I do my entire face I
always go in that order eyes face I face
a easier for me but before you do that
I'm going to set my under eye concealer
using my RC ma no color powder
I'm gonna take my Kat Von D 25 brush
it's like one of her new brushes and
just dip this right in
it's kind of like half-ass baking kind
of I'll dust that away in a second okay
so to finish the eyes all I'm going to
do is I'm going to take my color pop
eyeliner in mr. Bing I'm going to line
my waterline with this and then gonna
kind of bring it down a little bit
because I want to smoke it out with a
pencil a pencil brush so I'm coming out
of the waterline just a little bit to
make it a little thicker and then I'm
going to take this ELF pencil brush I'm
not exactly sure the name of this but
it's one of their new brushes but they
don't come out until October which I'm
so upset about I wish they wouldn't have
sent me the PR just yet because these
brushes are so good this one is just a
nice little pointy pencil brush so I am
just gonna some oak that eyeliner out
this is pretty much all I did for my
favorites video my last video I had like
a really smokey eyeliner that's all I
had and this is pretty much all I did
I'm also going to tightline with mr.
Bing now I'm going to curl my eyelashes
these are just my tweezer men lash
curlers but the Revlon ones are pretty
good from the drugstore and now I'm
going to go in with a few coats of my
Kiko extra sculpt Volume Mascara I got a
guy I get these on the Kiko website I
have a few backups this is probably my
all-time favorite mascara and it's like
$14 a little bit pricier than some that
you can find at the drugstore but
definitely more affordable than high-end
stuff hopefully not after I'm also
applying this to my bottom lashes as
well so you can go ahead and apply
falsies at this point but I'm gonna
leave it like this I think it looks
really cool but we are oh no wait we are
not done with the eyes no I'm actually
going to take my wedding wild
highlight in boozy brunch and I'm going
to clean off my little elf pencil brush
and I'm going to use this to highlight
my inner corners
okay so now we are completely done with
the eyes and let's finish the paste okay
so I'm going to contour my face a little
bit using the wet and wild contouring
palette in dulce de leche this is like
my favorite contour powder at the moment
I mean I've always loved it but recently
I have been really really using it I'm
going to take my morphe 53 brush and I'm
gonna contour just a little bit nothing
too heavy but just to define my face a
bit ignore my hair I look crazy but
that's okay I feel like it's the perfect
undertone to really contour your face up
no I'm so into this and their new
formula because they release this like a
while ago but then they reformulated it
and the new formula is even better it's
awesome and I actually really love this
as well to highlight underneath the eyes
such a good little duo and it's like
five dollars
okay so now I'm just going to warm up my
skin a little bit more I feel like I
look extra fair today like in the video
I don't know
so I'm just going to warm up the skin
I'm going to take my Real Techniques
blush brush and I'm going to use my
bronze booster in medium to dark from
Physicians Formula this bronzer that
looks like this just going to dunk my
brush into that and just warm up the
skin
I'm gonna add some to my nose just a
little bit okay I feel like that gave me
a little bit more of a 10 overall now to
highlight my face I'm just going to use
the same highlighter I used in the inner
corners by wetting wild its boozy brunch
this used to be the Fergie highlight in
the shade Hollywood Boulevard but then
they came out with the exact same
highlight again and named it boozy
brunch don't know why but they did so
I'm just using my little tapered
highlighter brush by luck see it's a 522
and I am going to highlight you know
what I'm not liking this brush to
highlight need something smaller I'm
gonna use my Real Techniques setting
brush some reason that was making my
highlight go on a little patchy
so now I'm going to go in with blush I
decided to go in with highlight first so
I could look a little bit more natural
like when you layer blush on top of
highlight it looks it makes the
highlight look a little bit more natural
I'm going to take my morphe 9n palette
such a pretty blush palette full of
different beautiful colors and I'm going
to take this color in the middle on my
Real Techniques multi-task brush and I'm
going to use that as my blood with a
very light hand I'm like tapping off the
majority of this product so I don't look
like I have super intense blushy cheeks
so now I'm going in with my lip and I'm
going to go in with a vibrant hot pink
lip I think it really ties in with the
eyeliner I'm going to use Sunday this is
an ultra matte lip by color pop and then
I'm going to go over it with a gloss
okay so you can go ahead and leave it
like this I think it looks really cool I
love a bold matte lip but I'm going to
go over it with the elf lip gloss in
well the elf lip lacquer in bold pink
it's similar to this color only this
color has kind of like a purple
undertone and this one is more pink okay
guys so that completes this video I
wanted to do something colorful and bold
but very easy at the same time so this
is what I came up with and I want it to
just sit here and do a talk through
because I haven't done one of these in a
while my voiceovers tend to be pretty
fast so I hope you enjoyed this video
