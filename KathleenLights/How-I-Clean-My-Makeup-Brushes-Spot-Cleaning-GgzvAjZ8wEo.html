a video I never thought I was gonna film
I know if I may seem weird but this
video has been so highly requested for
months now I never wanted to upload it
because I feel like my brush cleaning
routine is so simple I don't use like
olive oil I don't get really technical
when it comes to cleaning my brushes the
easier the better if you know what I
mean so I didn't want to make the video
since I thought it was so simple but
since it has been so highly requested I
thought you know what I'm gonna film it
anyway but I will say that the products
that I do use I love like I truly truly
love I stand behind my method 100% it
works for me it's easy it's simple I'm
going to show you two ways that I clean
my brushes kind of like a deep clean
like what I do to actually clean my
brushes and I'm going to show you how I
spot clean my brushes if you don't know
what that is basically you should be
washing your brushes like every two
weeks or like once a week I don't know
what they say I do it like every two
weeks and then in between washes I do
spot clean just so that my brushes don't
get like too much build up the brush
cleaner I love using it for spot
cleaning my brushes is the cinema
secrets make a brush cleaner this is
amazing because it's pretty much a dry
formula when you spray it on your brush
and I will show you but when you spray
it on your brush it wets your brush but
then it dries like instantly you could
use your brush immediately after using
this which is awesome since whenever you
wash your brushes you kind of have to
leave them drying overnight i buy this
at sephora i personally like the little
bottle that comes with a spray they do
have a bigger jug and kind of like a
little tin can that you can pour the
liquid in and dip your brushes in that
way but I find that I waste so much
product that way because you're filling
up that entire tin with liquid and then
by the time you're done using it is just
full of makeup so you have to throw that
away with a little spray I find I don't
go through it as quickly before I get
into the demo I'm sorry I feel like I'm
talking a lot but before I get into the
demo I want to explain to you what I use
my favorite brush cleaner of choice I
used to use Johnson and Johnson's baby
shampoo if you're on a budget or not
even on a budget I hate saying that if
you just don't want to spend your money
on a birth cleaner Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
baby shampoo really great at cleaning
brushes my personal fave
it is the blender cleanser solid by
Beautyblender it's pretty much just like
a bar of soap I love this so so much it
cleans my brushes so well it gives them
like a really really really deep clean
but it doesn't dry out my brushes which
is very important for me I don't feel
the need to really condition them with
like olive oil because I've never had a
problem with this drying it out the
Sephora brand does make a dupe that is
actually really really good
I just for the life of me can not find
mine
but the solid brush cleanser by Sephora
awesome I just use the one by Beauty
Blender I've gone through like ten of
these I constantly repurchase them and
then the main game changer for me which
you will see in the demo I love this
little thing this is the brush egg
dissolute brush egg guys I bought this
for dos pesos on Amazon no I think it
was like a dollar 50 on Amazon insane
insane
so it was like dirt cheap and it works
so well for a long time I just used my
hand I kind of just cleaned my brush on
my hand and I found that I had to clean
my brushes like more than once I had to
kind of clean them two times in a row
but with this little brush egg because
of its ridges it cleans the brushes
perfectly I know that the Sigma spa
glove or like the Sigma matte is very
popular I personally don't have that I
find that this for two dollars works
just as good I'm sure it does I've never
tried the spa glove but I'm sure this
works just as good so now that you know
more or less what I use let's get into
the demo okay so before I start this
video I want to apologize for my super
super messy sink I had just woken up I
had just brushed my teeth and apparently
I brushed my teeth like a savage and I
get toothpaste everywhere excuse the
messy sink okay moving on so I always
wet my brush a little bit first and then
I start to buff it into the soap I
always make sure that I really do a good
job of buffing it into the soap so that
the soap can like really get into the
brush and then I just run some water on
my brush egg and I start to buff this on
to the brush egg it's really really
simple the ridges on the brush egg make
it really easy and then once I feel like
I got it nice and
so P I just run it under the water and
make sure that all of the soap is out
and that's it voila you have a clean
brush really really really simple I just
squeeze it make sure all the water is
out and I just shape it into place and
then I just clean off my solid cleanser
and continue all over again I know a lot
of people like to store their brushes
upside down I have so many brushes so I
find that it's not convenient for me to
do that so I just lay it on its side
like I just put a towel down and lay all
my brushes on their side and honestly
that has been working perfectly fine for
me of course storing them upside down
would be ideal so that all the water can
like drip from the Farrow and not get
into the faroe of your brush but laying
them on their side has been doing has
been doing me pretty good so far so I'm
just repeating the process I'm just
showing you here over and over again but
now I've sped it up I just wet my brush
rub it into that soap make sure it gets
super super soapy then I just buff it
back and forth on the ridges of the
brush egg now the brush egg has like
these little bumpy's on top like the
little circles as you can see I don't
exactly know what that's for I honestly
just squirrel my brush over the entire
thing and here I'm just showing you that
I do the exact same thing with I brushes
same technique so so simple I love this
little brush egg it is a lifesaver for
cleaning your brushes guys you need this
in your life it is less than two dollars
I swear it makes a world of a difference
when it comes to washing my brushes it's
amazing
okay so now I'm going to show you how I
spot clean my brushes in between washes
sometimes I use like funky colors or
sometimes like my brush is already
getting too gunky and I want to give it
a quick little fix so that I can use it
I would just spray my cinema secrets
brush cleaner on my brush and then I
start to swirl it on a paper towel and
it's clean obviously it's not as clean
as if you were cleaning it with an
actual cleanser but for a quick little
fix it's awesome
I believe that this is alcohol in it
which helps like disinfect the brushes
as well here I have like a super gunky
brush I got a lot of questions about
this brush it's just nice to fora 55
brush or 50 - not sure it just came in
like limited edition rose packaging so I
bought it because I thought it was
pretty but it is they're just standard
brush so yeah as you can see here I'm
just spot cleaning away oh and this
brush cleaner has a nice vanilla scent
it can seem a little bit chemically at
first but when you smell your brushes
they smell like vanilla which is awesome
okay so yeah that completes this part of
the video and love you guys okay guys so
that completes this video I've seen a
lot of people do these video and they're
just a lot more entertaining and a lot
more informative but gotta be honest
this is what I use three products paper
towels napkins that's it I hope this
video did help you in some way maybe
you'll check out one of these products I
highly recommend them thank you guys so
