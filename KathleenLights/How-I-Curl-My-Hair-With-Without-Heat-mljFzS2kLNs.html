my naturally curly hair and how I get my
curls like this with heat um what I use
and what I do to get these curls and
also I wear my hair naturally curly in a
lot of my videos and I'm going to show
you how I achieve that I'm just going to
jump right into it because my camera is
dying and really there is nothing else
to say but I'm going to be warning you
right now I do not have makeup on in
this video I literally go through the
process of what I do after a shower when
I wake up blah blah blah and I have no
makeup on throughout this entire video
so that's just a warning also if you're
interested in the makeup I'm wearing
right now I just filmed right now a get
ready with me video on this makeup look
and that video will be up on Friday so
if you're interested to see this makeup
then check back in on Friday and yeah
that's it
I'm just going to go ahead and get into
it okay so in this clip I have just
finished washing my hair and now I am
wrapping it up in a towel and I always
wash my hair a couple of hours before
bed so when my hair is about fifty
percent dry I will take it out of the
towel and then kind of smooth down my
bangs I never brush my hair when I get
out of the shower because then my hair
will get crazy puffy I always brush my
hair right before I shower so that's my
little tip if you have curly hair then I
just take my Frederic Fekkai a brilliant
glossing cream and I part my hair
and then I will just pump like the size
of a penny into the palm of my hand and
I will run that throughout my whole hair
brushing your hair when you get out of
the shower just kind of messes up the
curls and gets your hair extremely
extremely frizzy trust me if you want
your hair to stay nice nicely curled do
not brush it when you get out of the
shower if you have curly hair obviously
so after I put the glossing cream all
over my hair I just start kind of
scrunching it with my fingers while
scrunching it well you see what I'm
doing I'm scrunching it and I'm just
kind of making the curls in my hair
because from so many years of flat
ironing it it kind of lost a lot of its
natural curl so I just kind of you know
scrunch my hair up and I do that for
about two minutes I'm literally there
forever
and then after I do that I am ready for
bed and that's all I do the night before
so the very next day okay excuse my
ratchetness I had just woken up and all
I did was wash my face and brush my
teeth I look absolutely crazy anyway my
bangs pretty much stay frizzy and puffy
no matter what I do unless I go over it
with a curling iron
but anyway I just take my healthy sexy
hair soy renewal nourishing styling
treatment and clearly I needed buy the
full size ready and you get on with it
and just buy it because I love this
stuff I just put a pea-sized amount of
that in my in the palm of my hand and
just run that throughout my whole hair I
love this because it tames my frizz ease
and it just makes my hair nice and silky
and smooth and not so puffy which is
what I like so because I don't really
like my bangs much I'll usually just
pick up my hair like half-up half-down I
do this a lot in my videos actually yeah
obviously I look crazy right now with no
makeup on and like my guitar shirt but
once you you know get dressed up and put
some makeup on you know the hair comes
together and or I'll just take some
bobby pins and just pin my bangs back
and yeah that's all I do when I just
feel like not putting any heat on my
hair and just going all natural that's
that's what I do
okay so now I'm going to show you how I
curl my hair with my curling iron I'm
just going to take my Tresemme heat
tamer spray I love this and now I am
about to show you what my hair looks
like when I brush it are you ready don't
get scared oh this is why I don't brush
it when I get out the shower anyway I'm
just going to spray this all over my
hair I put a lot of this I really like
my hair protected from the heat
obviously so now before I curl my hair I
just kind of section it off and only
leave the hairs out that frame my face
as you can see here I just have like the
bun and the only parts of my hair that's
how are the ones that just frame my face
and then I take my flat iron and iron
the hairs that are close to my head and
the reason why I do this is because I
have frizzy hair like I've said about 16
times in this video but whenever I curl
my hair I need to iron the parts that
are really really close to my head
because if not it will look really
really frizzy at the root of my hair so
I just do that to the hairs that frame
my face and the reason why I don't like
blow dry my hair straight and then curl
it is because I don't want that much
heat on my hair and also I like how big
my curls look when I don't have it
straight before so if I were to like
curl my hair when it was already
straight the curls would be very very
very like flat and I like how they're
like big and voluminous when I curl it
with my puffy hair you get what I'm
saying anyway so and I'm just gonna pick
up my curling one from the floor
apparently and the curling one I use and
really like is the Conner infinity it's
pretty cheap and it's just a one that
goes from like fat to skinny I just I
really enjoy this wand
and basically I just section off my hair
sloppily there's no rhyme or reason to
this part I just section off my hair and
basically I just start grabbing sections
I'm not precise with this I just grab a
chunk of hair and start curling it I do
like the curls though in different
directions so I'll take the first strand
of hair and curl it away from my face
like what I'm doing now and then the
second chunk of hair I coral curl I say
that weird weird weird why can't I talk
I curl towards my face by the way if you
see me talking I'm not talking to myself
I'm not that weird
I'm on the phone with my friend anyway
so I just curl towards my face as you
see me doing there and that's basically
all I do every chunk of hair I curl in
the opposite direction and I feel like
this gives more dimension to your hair
and it doesn't have all your curls just
going one way it just kind of looks all
flowy and different and I just like that
so that's that's what I'm doing I hold
it for a few seconds then let it go but
I just curled towards my face and away
from my face and towards my face you
know you get the pattern
the size of the hair that I grab changes
every time sometimes it's like super
tiny words this tiny look like right now
this is tiny little spiral other times I
grab more hair I just think like I said
before it gives dimension and it gives
more body to my hair and yes I am a
moron who doesn't switch her hand when
doing the other side of the of my hair I
am really weird like that I cannot do
anything with my right hand it's just I
can't so I use the same hand to curl
that side of my face which I kind of
look awkward doing but I swear it's a
lot more comfortable for me then if I
use my right hand but when I get towards
the hairs that frame my face I do use my
right hand you'll see I'll show you that
in a minute but yeah curl towards then
curl away and that is all I do
and basically I just continue doing this
I keep sectioning off and doing the same
thing over and over again
you
you
okay so when I do oh my god excuse my
roots I promise I am going to get my
hair done soon it's it's starting to
look terrible I know anyway so when I do
the hairs that frame my face like my
bang area I always curl away from from
my face so as you can see I wrap it
around the wand away from my face I
don't switch it up like I don't curl
towards my face because just the hairs
that frame my face I like for my hair to
like go backwards and flow back like
that and then just like the curls away
from my face but only like towards my
bangs
okay so when I do my other side I
actually do use my right hand even
though I feel super weird doing it but
when I do my bangs I do use my opposite
hand on the opposite side probably can't
tell but I feel super awkward doing it I
have to like switch the wand and go back
and switch the one because I can't
section off my hair with my other hand
because apparently that's too difficult
of a task so I have to put the wand back
in my other hand and you see it's just
weird for me but yeah I just curl my
bangs away from my face and that's it
then I just let my hair loose and start
running my fingers through my hair to
kind of soften and loosen the curls up a
little bit
now I just take a finishing serum this
is a new me one that I got in my Ipsy
bag a while ago but any finishing serum
is good they just leave your hair really
glossy and shiny and when you curl your
hair kind of it content to take the
shine away from your hair so I just put
on a finishing serum it also tames my
frizz which I love anything that tames
my frizz apparently and yeah that is all
I do
I really love how finishing serums look
when I curl my hair so yeah that's
basically it
that is basically all I do I know it's
really simple so whenever you see my
hair kind of you know just untamed wild
and free that's what I do
and usually you see my hair curled I
curled it with the Conair infinity wand
it's my favorite wand and it's usually
it usually looks like this unless I'm
curling it with my flat iron I actually
have a video um where I show you how I
curl my hair with my flat iron my
Tennant get ready with me video I think
it's the modern Hollywood glam video
that I uploaded I show you how I get my
curls with my flat iron which that looks
really pretty too so if you want to see
that I will link that video down below
but basically this is how I curl my hair
