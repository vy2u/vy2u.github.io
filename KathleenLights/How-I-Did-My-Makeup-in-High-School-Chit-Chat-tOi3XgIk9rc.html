kind of a different one maybe a little
bit weird but it's gonna be all about
how I did my makeup while I was in high
school I was watching Mira's video Mayra
touch of glam here on YouTube I will
link her channel down below she did an
entire video on how she did her makeup
when she was in high school and I
thought it was such a funny idea and I
really wanted to do it so I will link
her high school makeup version down
below she's super talented and really
really good at makeup so make sure you
check her out at first when I saw her
video I was like oh that's such a good
idea but then I thought wow mine would
be completely pointless because my
makeup routine in high school was like
nothing like I didn't really do much but
I thought it would be fun to just sit
down and talk to you guys maybe
reminisce back on high school have a
little bit of a chatty video while I
show you what I did in high school and
it's so funny because I have everything
that I used in high school obviously not
the same exact products I used in high
school because that would make them like
six or seven years old they are
repurchases this video is so dumb I have
four products guys I literally have four
makeup products I wanted to see if I
found a polo in one of my drawers but I
actually don't own one we had uniform in
my high school I'm not sure how the rest
of the world works but I always had
uniform in pre-k elementary middle
school high school we always always had
to wear our uniform and for high school
it actually wasn't as strict as some of
the other high schools around me because
we got to wear jeans which most high
schools didn't let you you had to wear
like khaki pants but we got to wear
jeans but we had to pair it with a blue
a white or a red polo very patriotic but
that was the uniform I never wore white
polos because I hated the way that I
looked in white when I was in high
school so I literally had like crap-ton
of blue and red polos in my drawers why
am I talking to you guys about my
uniform like nobody cares this is not
what the video is about throughout my
entire high school career my hair was
pinned straight i ironed my hair
literally every time i washed it i never
embraced my naturally curly hair as much
as i do now which i totally regret
because so many years of ironing my hair
totally messed up my curls my hair
doesn't get nearly as curly as I used to
I used to have like Shirley Temple curls
animal inside no I know that I keep
promising my natural hair routine
and that's coming I'm so sorry I'm so
sorry but I promise you I'm gonna I'm
gonna film it very soon okay so I guess
I'll just go ahead and get started on my
three minute makeup tutorial because
there's not much you're gonna see here I
actually did my makeup every morning on
my way to school I wasn't that kind of
girl who woke up early and then you know
put her makeup on and then left no my
mom had to drag me out of bed every
morning I was not a morning person I
hated waking up at 6 a.m. for school so
I would just put on makeup while my mom
drove me to school
so to get started on this look I think
I'm gonna go ahead and skip primer and
foundation and concealer and powder
because I literally had no idea what any
of those things were in high school it's
so crazy to think that I would not even
conceal my dark circles cuz now they
like drive me crazy but I just didn't
really know much about makeup I didn't
start watching youtube videos till like
my um has that been in my tooth the
entire time frijoles negatives really I
didn't start watching makeup tutorials
to like my junior and senior year of
high school and even then all I did was
like watch them I never practiced it on
my face I always started off with this
guy right here
I have gone through so many pencils of
this but you guys know I've talked about
this a ton on my channel this is Mac
Costa reach I Cole this was pretty much
the only eyeliner used in high school
sometimes I throw in a black eyeliner if
I was feeling dangerous but it was
always this and when I was in high
school I thought Mac was the end-all
be-all of makeup I really really really
had no knowledge of other brands but it
was only because in high school I didn't
really know what Sephora was I had never
even heard of Sephora when I was a
junior or a senior so I would just show
up to my mall like the mall closest to
my house and I would walk into Macy's
and shop my makeup at the Mac counter or
the Clinique counter because they were
right next to each other and that's the
only makeup I knew about and I knew
about Clinique because my grandmother
used to wear Konig
and obviously I wanted everything my
sister had being a younger sister like
you just want to be like your older
sister she always had MACT I remember
she had like this big drawer full of
makeup and I would like secretly open it
when she wasn't there and look at all
the Mac stuff so I learned about Mac
through her but honestly after learning
so much about makeup and researching so
much about makeup Mac is not like that
great there are a hundred other brands
out there that are way better than Mac
in my opinion like I barely even use Mac
anymore there's more fish in the scene
so after I would put on my eyeliner very
carefully at red lights I would jump
into mascara and this is the first
mascara I ever really used this is the
Clinique lash doubling mascara I've come
through so many tubes of this you guys
have no idea this is the first mascara
my mom ever bought me instead of like
taking me to the drugstore and like I
don't know showing me that kind of
makeup she just gave me whatever she
used and my mom used Clinique and Mac
and stuff so I'm just gonna go in with a
few coats of my lash doubling mascara in
high school I felt naked unless I had
mascara on like I wouldn't go anywhere
unless I had mascara on which is so
funny to think now because if I had to
leave the house with only one makeup
product on my face it would be my brows
I would have to fill in my brows now and
I never even touched my brows in high
school
but I feel like back in 2009 and stuff
like nobody-nobody really did their
brows or maybe just like nobody I went
to school with did their brows this used
to be my favorite mascara of all time I
even have a whole video dedicated to
this mascara when I first started my
channel but actually it's not my
favorite anymore and it's crazy because
I was addicted to this mascara but I've
just discovered so many good ones like
the Kiko one is the same price I believe
and it's so much better I'm curious to
see what people would do with this video
like I really hope people do this video
like do this challenge I would love to
see the kind of makeup other Beauty
vloggers wore in high school just to see
the difference and see how far we've
come
there were days where I would just say
get mascara on my eyelid and be like
alright that's staying there and I kind
of feel like nowadays it's almost
expected of you to wear makeup it's
almost like you have to wear a full face
and makeup to high school and I don't
think you do I feel like you should only
if you want to if that's how you express
yourself and you want a pile on the
makeup definitely go for it but if you
don't want to you don't have to
I don't think makeup makes you beautiful
or not I don't think your contour game
is what makes you a cool person you know
super cheesy but beauty comes from
within so you don't have to put on
makeup to feel beautiful you should feel
beautiful because you're a beautiful
person okay so now for that what was I
thinking part in high school I had one
face product and it's what I used as my
bronzer and my blush all in one and this
is the only thing I ever used this is
the Mac blush in the shade harmony my
mom bought this for me for the first
time when I was 15 it's what I wore on
my keen says and she did my makeup for
my 15 and I just fell in love with this
product so I would go in with like a
fluffy brush just like this this is the
Real Techniques blush brush but the
brush I used actually I think it was
even from Clinique it had a blue handle
and it was see-through like a
see-through blue really really cool
handle was short and I had a hewitt was
like a huge powder brush a little bit
bigger than this but it shed like a mofo
like I remember I would put on my
bronzer and just like pears would be all
over my face but I kept that brush for
years it was the one and only face brush
I had for like five years and eventually
I had to throw it away because it was
literally falling apart when I would
wash it so I would always just dip my
brush into this and just literally throw
it on my cheeks like this like I
remember sitting in the car and applying
it to my bare ass face that doesn't pick
up much pigment just work that into my
skin
after I had on what felt like enough
blush I would take some and just put
that all over my face and obviously
since there's no foundation underneath
it doesn't really stick to the skin all
that well
I would even put some on my nose and I
would take some down my neck just to
give the appearance of a tan that's what
I would do you could just imagine how
fast I would go through one of these
things cuz I used it as literally
everything so that is what I would do to
my face
super bronzy and then I would just like
brush my eyebrows with my fingers and
that's it for the face and the eyes and
then I would go in with my lipstick
looking at this lipstick brings back so
many memories this is the MAC lipstick
in the shade pretty please this was my
first MAC lipstick ever obsessed with
this lipstick I would go through this
like water
it's the lipstick I wore every single
day I think this is also something my
mom bought me for my 15s now I don't
think I would ever wear this lipstick
again because it's a little bit too
light and frosty for my liking but it's
all I wore this was my signature
lipstick in high school I wore it on a
daily basis in high school there wasn't
a day in high school like my junior or
senior year that I did not wear this I
didn't really wear much makeup my
freshman or sophomore year but this was
my lipstick and I would just plop it on
no lip liner or anything this doesn't
even look that great on the lips like
this lipstick totally emphasizes all the
lines on my lips so yeah that completes
this makeup tutorial this is the makeup
I wore all throughout high school pretty
much I'm looking in the mirror right now
and I feel like I'm staring at the 16
year old version of me
it's insane I'm actually gonna pop up a
picture right here of me my senior year
of high school I took this picture while
I was in the car and I am literally
wearing everything that you see on my
face right now
Kosar rich matte harmony pretty please
and the Clinique mascara all in this
photo I can't believe I loved this
lipstick that much I was in someone who
had like a makeup bag full of stuff my
makeup bag was like really small and it
consisted of these four items my love
for makeup honestly didn't grow until I
graduated I even remember the first day
I was like okay I'm gonna go to
Walgreens
I'm gonna buy some makeup and I was
browsing the drugstore section and I
text my friend and I was like can you
please help me out I don't know what
foundation to use can you text me a good
foundation for me to buy at the
drugstore and I remember she replied
with the Revlon Colorstay foundation for
dry skin and I fell in love with it like
I was shocked the first time I ever put
on foundation and as I was putting it on
I was like holy crap this like covers my
skin it was like surreal for me which is
so funny to think about because now I
have like a million foundations and my
life is consumed my makeup but I
wouldn't have it any other way I I love
makeup so much but it just goes to show
you that you can go from knowing
absolutely zero about makeup to doing it
for a living there are makeup artists
out there that literally started like
all of us so if you are someone who you
want to be a makeup artist you want to
be a beauty blogger if that's something
you want to do stick to it watch makeup
tutorials practice on yourself that's
what I did after high school like
practicing makeup on myself became my
hobby I didn't even know where concealer
was supposed to go when I was in high
school like I didn't know anything and
it's something we learn and I learn
every day I'm still learning keep doing
it I totally believe in you you will get
there and you will eventually love the
way you do your makeup I promise you do
not be discouraged my rock created this
challenge I think I don't I've never
seen anybody else do this video I'm
gonna write specific youtubers down
below to see if maybe they do this video
but don't forget to check out my rizvi
do as well but yeah I complete this
video I love you guys thank you so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye obviously not the same
things I used in high school I'm
drinking too much my human
I even have oh my god I have a birthmark
here who's one guys so today's video is
gonna be my Ipsy bag unbagging I got
back from Los Angeles and I realized
