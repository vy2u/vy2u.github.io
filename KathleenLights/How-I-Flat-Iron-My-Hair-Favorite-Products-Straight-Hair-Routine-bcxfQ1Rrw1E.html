how I earn my hair I never thought I
would ever do this video because I
always thought that straightening your
hair was something that was so easy but
the more requests I got to film this
video the more realize like wow maybe I
should film that video my mom is a
hairstylist like she's a hairdresser she
has her license for it she's done like
her since I was a little girl so she
told me a lot about hair growing up how
to style it how to iron it and I
realized that not everybody has a hair
stylist does another so I'm going to
show you exactly how I earn it it's
gonna be kind of like a voiceover it was
when I was ironing my hair the other day
and since I was already making this
video I thought I would share with you
my favorite hair products when I
straightened my hair I just recently
uploaded my natural curly hair routine
and all the products I love using when I
leave my hair natural but these
specifically are products I love using
whenever I Flatiron my hair so first off
I want to introduce blue to you this is
my baby this is my holy grail flat iron
this is the original light Chee I used
to have a black one this is the only
flat iron I will use and I know a lot of
people fight me on it a lot of people
don't like this but it's the only one
that straightens my hair and it doesn't
leave it frizzy
I can tell a huge difference when I my
hair with a different flat iron since my
mom's does have like her license for
hair I got this at salon centric and it
was like more affordable there I've had
this flat iron for 6 or 7 years I mean
can you tell can't you tell this thing
looks Toa from the flow up and alright
look at that I remember the day
purchased this I feels like forever ago
and it's still going strong it still
works just as great as it did the day I
bought it the one I had before this one
was black and I had that one for a
million years as well word on the street
is that they've changed this since I
haven't bought a cheat iron in seven
years I hear that it's not as good
anymore what why I hope that's a lie I
hope that was just a rumor I heard
because I love me some cheek so I just
want to show you the gunky flat iron
that I use it's my favorite and even
though I have to like run this through
my hair a couple of times cuz my hair
can be a little frizzy it just does the
best job in my personal opinion so I
know I spoke about eight
French shampoo in my natural hair video
but when I know I'm gonna iron my hair
this is the shampoo I will always use I
love this this is the bumble and bumble
bee bee hairdressers invisible oil
sulfate free shampoo I bought this
because I heard Casey Holmes raving
about it and I was like I need to get
that if she loves it I think I'm gonna
love it and I do it's like a huge
favorite of mine I love this because it
cleans my hair so well sometimes if I
use a different shampoo when I'm flat
ironing my hair I can see that it
already looks greasy and I don't know if
you guys have this experience or not but
I can get away with greasy hair when my
hair is curly but when it's straight you
can see like you can see the grease and
I feel like this shampoo works miracles
with that because it cleans my hair to
the point where it doesn't look greasy
but it doesn't strip my hair either it's
very hydrating but in a super squeaky
clean kind of way but not like squeaky
clean like like hydrating clean it says
it has six feather light oils to help
soften soakin tame D frizz detangle and
protect seriously an amazing amazing
shampoo and I highly recommend it so
after I shampoo my hair I go in with my
hair masque this is the same hair masque
I already spoke about in my other video
I will link it below I don't want to
stress too much about it because I
already spoke about it but this is the
living proof restore masque treatment I
love this hair masque no matter what I'm
gonna do to my hair it hydrates my hair
so well it really makes my hair feel
nice and silky like if it actually is
doing something so love love this mask
and then when I get out of the shower
even if I'm going to style my hair
naturally or iron it I always use the
Brio Gio rose Arco milk this is just a
leave-in conditioner but it's very milky
and very light so I like applying this
everywhere it doesn't make my hair grey
see it doesn't weigh down my hair or
leave a film it soaks right into the
hair but it leaves your hair really nice
and soft so I really really love this
and then what I'll do is I'll just let
my hair air dry since I'm already flat
ironing it I don't want to add extra
heat so I'll just do other things while
I wait for my hair to dry and then when
it's completely dry I will go in with a
heat protectant this one is definitely
my favorite this is a new bottle this is
the
caviar Repair multivitamin heat
protection spray by the brand alterna I
bought this at Sephora has vitamin A b6
b12 vitamin C vitamin E and biotin and
it's basically that it's a heat
protecting spray nothing too special but
I like this one specifically because it
doesn't leave my hair hard sometimes I
would notice that if I used a different
heat protector and I would like start
flat ironing my hair it would kind of
skip and get stuck on my hair like it
would do one of these and I would have
to like pull that my hair to get the
iron to keep going and I never
understood what that was I thought that
was just my hair texture but once I
started using this heat protectant spray
that stops happening so I really really
love this one I mean your hair is still
getting damaged it's getting flat iron
but it helps and then the last product I
want to talk about before I show you
guys how I actually flat iron my hair is
this product right here and this is
actually new to me I just recently got
this a few weeks ago this is the bumble
and bumble bee bee hairdressers
invisible oil dry oil finishing spray
lightweight mist for a subtle shine and
softness and it's for dry hair this
really caught my attention since I'm
such a big fan of the shampoo I thought
I'm gonna give that a try I have dry
hair I might like that and I really
really really like this when I Flatiron
my hair sometimes I notice that it loses
a little bit of its shine versus when
it's curly so this really has been
helping let's see if you can tell the
difference
now you bought it Kendall I love using
this spritz all this smells amazing it
smells so good and it leaves your hair
feeling and looking so silky without it
looking greasy or feeling greasy or
weighing it down I really really like
this I think even those of you with oily
hair would like this because it's a way
to add the shine to the tips of your
hair without it being an actual oil so I
have really really been liking this
which is why I wanted to include it in
this video because I see myself using it
all up so without further ado I'm going
to get into the actual flat-ironing of
this video let's get into it okay so I
always start out with a heat protectant
as I said earlier
excu
Barents it's like 1:00 in the morning
when I'm filming this and I'm sitting at
my vanity talking to Amelia while iron
my hair she's like sitting in front of
me on the couch okay so when it comes to
flat ironing my hair I really like to
work in sections I mean you guys see
what I'm doing so it's kind of stupid
and pointless to explain because I'm
sure you can see what's going on but I
part my hair into like fatter sections
and then I take tiny sections within
those sections and then I iron them
little by little I do have to pass the
iron like three or four times sometimes
even five times one of ironing my hair
because my hair can stay a little bit
frizzy if I don't you know pass the iron
a couple of times I don't leave it on my
hair for too long either like I'm not
they're slowly bringing it down I do it
pretty quickly so that I don't put too
much heat on it for too long I also try
to get as close to my scalp as possible
you don't want to burn your head or
anything so just be careful with that
working in smaller sections does help
you get really really close so I guess
because I'm left-handed I always start
ironing on my right side but once I
can't reach that way I just take my hair
and put it on the left side of my body
and I start ironing like that like how
you see me doing now because I
personally can't do anything with my
right hand
I can't even iron my hair like I can't
switch the iron back and forth in my
hands because that would never work I
can't do anything at all
with my right hand it's pretty useless
but anyway so I'm just gonna let you
watch the rest of this video and watch
me doing my hair because it's pretty
it's pretty self-explanatory know what
I'm saying alright here we go
okay so that is how I fought iron my
hair I'm sorry I look crazy in that in
those clips but yeah that completes this
video thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye ah it just does the it just
it's just a man I love my thighs oh I
always use my favorite this huh
