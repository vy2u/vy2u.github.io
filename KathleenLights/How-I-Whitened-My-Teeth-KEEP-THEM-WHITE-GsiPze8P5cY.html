gonna be a quick one hopefully I have
gotten a lot of questions recently about
how I keep my teeth white like what I
use to whiten them I keep them that way
and yada yada yada so I thought I would
enter those questions in this video I
thought I would just sit here really
quick and just talk about it so I just
want to quickly mention that this video
is not sponsored the things that I'm
showing you in this video I purchased
myself I'm gonna see if I can find old
photos I had like pretty yellow teeth in
high school I drink a lot of coffee I
still do a lot I drink a lot of coffee
and I don't know they weren't like
mustard yellow but I was not happy with
my smile at all I mean I would still
smile in pictures but sometimes I
couldn't wear like orange II based
lipsticks and those are my favorite
lipsticks to wear like ripe oranges and
stuff like that because they kind of
made my teeth look even yellower than
they already were but now I'm a lot more
comfortable and I pretty much wear any
lipstick comfortably I don't really mind
them but anyway so like four years ago I
decided to take the plunge and I
purchased the crest 3d white Whitestrips
and I got the professional effects when
I like begged my dad to give me 50 bucks
cuz that's how much these things are and
he was like dang gyrl 50 bucks and I was
like please I need them so bad so he
bought them for me like four years ago I
was like no like five years ago yes like
five years ago they do have different
ones this one is just the professional
effects one this is the one that I
bought because it was the most expensive
one and when I read reviews online it
was the one that gave the best results
they have different ones they have like
advanced vivid or they have a bunch of
different ones but I prefer and
recommend the professional effects they
are pricier and they are more intense
but they get the job done now I don't
have sensitive teeth I'm not gonna lie
the first time I use this when I use
them all up I noticed that my teeth were
just a little bit sensitive but it kind
of went away after like a month and I
didn't feel it
anymore like my teeth were not sensitive
at all but it was literally like I felt
like a completely different person my
teeth went from like pretty yellow to
white as paper they were so white using
these and I haven't used them again
since and I just purchased these like
two weeks ago cuz I wanted to do it
again and I have already used the four
of them they still have like a lot more
to go but I was really really happy with
the results of these because I felt like
I didn't really need to do them again
until recently they kept my teeth white
for such a long time I mean I did it
five years ago I was a senior in high
school that's a pretty long time I would
say and these are my favorite it doesn't
matter if you get the professional
effects one or if you don't the crest 3d
white Whitestrips are my favorite
because they stick to the teeth too
really nicely you don't get that weird
gel I have tried to use other ones like
a month ago I tried dial a smile that
white and enlightening one I didn't like
it I didn't like it at all I had like
gel I didn't like it
and I also used one from another brand
that was like a brush kind of thing or
something and I didn't like it either I
don't know I have just been a loyal
customer to the crest 3d white
Whitestrips if you do have sensitive
teeth I highly recommend using the one
that it's a lot cheaper and I think it's
just called the Vivid's those are better
for sensitive teeth and if you find that
your teeth start to hurt it is a
temporary pain though your teeth are not
gonna hurt for the rest of your life
it's temporary but if you find that your
teeth start to hurt skip a date so
you're supposed to use one of these
every single day until your pack runs
out skip a date do it one day yes when
they know when they ask when they know
or one day ask two days know one day yes
two days no it's okay you will still get
good results it's just gonna take a
little bit longer and I highly recommend
that for those of you with sensitive so
that is what I did to get them white how
I have been maintaining them white for
the past five years two things I don't
have the other thing to show you because
I just ran out of it
but I use this so sounds like a
sponsored video but I purchased this
myself and
I did also with the mouthwash but I used
the crest 3d white toothpaste this
toothpaste keeps my teeth white I notice
it if I start using Colgate for like 2
weeks my teeth aren't my teeth don't
feel like why I don't know maybe it's in
my head but actually my friend America
one time stayed at my house like the
weekend or something and she was like
wow that toothpaste is amazing I feel
like my teeth are getting whiter and
I've only used it twice which is
probably ridiculous but it says it
removes up to 80% of surface surface
stains and whiter teeth 100% guaranteed
I agree that your teeth I don't think it
makes your teeth whiter but it has kept
my teeth white I don't know this
toothpaste is magic in a tube it's the
only toothpaste any uses as well we will
not use any other toothpaste and they
have different this one's a brady and
mint and i think they have like another
one and also i highly recommend the
crest 3d white mouthwash i use this in
conjunction with the mouthwash and I'm
telling you it's been keeping my teeth
white all of these years so yeah there
is no secret there is nothing that I do
special like there's no blue light
there's nothing cool that I use for my
teeth I just use the crest 3d white line
and I must emphasize again I bought all
of this this is not sponsored sounds
very sponsor II but it's not I have been
using these products for the past five
years and it has not steered me wrong
and I'm pretty happy with the color with
the whiteness of my teeth even though I
am currently I'm a second box of this so
yeah but it's pretty much all I have to
say I hope this video was helpful at all
because I feel like I've only been
sitting here for like five minutes I
will link it let me see if I can find
these products probably like at Target
that's where I purchased this these
products Target so I will link it down
below just in case you are interested
but do your research you know your teeth
better than I know your teeth so do your
research and yes I will link everything
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
hope it was helpful like I said thank
