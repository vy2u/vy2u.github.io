tats today is a more personal video a
few of you guys have asked me to do I
can breathe today for some reason
I'm anxiety isn't that funny a lot of
you guys have asked me to do a video on
how I deal with my anxiety my anxiety
story and all that stuff and at first I
was debating if I should do this video
not because it is a little bit more
personal and sometimes people can't
really deal with other people expressing
their feelings and sometimes people
don't care actually 90% of people do not
care about how you feel so this video is
for those of you who have asked for this
type of video if you are someone who
really doesn't give a crap about anxiety
my anxiety or my story because I will be
explaining to you guys how I developed
anxiety um certain things that happened
to me in my life I will be talking about
them so this is going to be a long video
probably really boring so if you have no
interest in that please don't leave any
negative comments below just exit out
and go on your merry way and hopefully I
can help at least one person I will be
talking about like how I cope with it
and stuff at the end of the video I will
be talking more about like my life and I
have and what I think caused the anxiety
so my entire life I had a really really
great childhood I had a really good life
growing up not saying I don't have a
really good life now and just hang
growing up I thought I was like the
luckiest little kid ever I went to
Disney World all the time I had great
parents have I have great parents and I
honestly felt like I had the perfect
family from my parents I am the only
child that they had together before my
dad married my mom he had a son before
my mom married my dad he had my sister
Alette and my brother Johnny I grew up
with my brother Johnny and I let like my
whole life so I don't really see them as
half I hate that word
I don't really see them as half brothers
and sisters they're in my blood they are
like we came out of the same area you
know what I'm saying just want to point
that out there just in case
anybody gets confused about the way but
anyway so I had a really really good
childhood um right after high school
maybe not right right after but very
soon after high school my life kind of
just hit a brick wall at least in my
opinion at least that's what it felt
like that I could I could honestly say
that 2011 was the worst year in my
entire life
I don't really really get into too much
detail because I will start crying like
a psycho here and that's just awkward
um one day oh my god I'm already gonna
start crying uh one day my mom just told
me um your dad and I are getting
divorced I've been married for like 21
years and they were together my entire
life so it kind of was really really
shocking to see like me as an 18 year
old my whole life I kept my parents up
in a pedestal like wow my parents are
divorced so many parents are divorced
I'm so lucky so lucky and that happened
and my parents you know that was
happening and I was 18 and it's still
weird because you always hear about how
kids really suffer through divorces like
the younger they are the more they
suffer which I'm sure that's absolutely
true I don't know I wasn't in that
position but people seem to think that
because you're older you're 18 that a
divorce does not affect a child even if
you are an adult and it absolutely does
I I grew up my whole life with my mom
and my dad in the same house under the
same roof I never had to go to two
Christmases two birthdays two
Thanksgivings I always felt so bad for
like the kids in my school or my friends
or my cousins who did so being such a
close family my mom was my best friend
my whole life and then after so long
that kind of stopping I didn't take it
very well it was something I was not
used to you know I was in a routine all
the time I'm very afraid of change I've
always been afraid of change I've always
hated it I like routine and because of
my age because I was 18 years old they
didn't feel the need to keep certain
things from me well as a parent when
you're going through a divorce and you
have young children you don't fight in
front of the children you don't do
certain things in front of the kids
because they don't understand
don't get divorce but as an 18 year old
I absolutely understand divorce and they
thought I was an adult so they just you
know I saw all the ugliness that
happened front and center
I witnessed it all I want to respect my
parents and not say much but it was not
a pretty divorce and I saw it all first
hand I remember I was going to live with
my mom really close after they told me
about the divorce I was going to move in
with her in an apartment while Danny was
here in Mississippi you know before I
left with him to come live here I was
gonna live with her an apartment I
remember walking into the apartment and
looking around and then going into the
bathroom and crying for like an hour in
the bathroom because I lived in the same
house for 18 years and kind of like the
thought of me living somewhere else that
was in my home with my parents it was
weird
and then a couple months after my
parents told me they were getting
divorced I told my parents I was getting
married it was it was super awkward
timing but honestly I caught married at
the perfect perfect time because Danny
took me away from all that toxic
negative energy that was going on so so
yeah I told my parents that I was
getting married you know while they were
going while they were going through a
divorce it was very very weird for my
dad my dad was like you know whatever
makes you happy he didn't get it but he
was you know very very very comforting
about it whatever makes you happy and my
mom loved Danny's my mom was all for it
you know so that happened and I took I
didn't take it very well but I was okay
I would mean I wasn't okay but I was I
was fine um and then I got married I
left to Mississippi
my mom got her own place she moved in
with her mom and then my dad stayed at
our home so my dad kept the house and
you know things were okay they were fine
and then Danny one on deployment I'm
back to Miami to stay with my dad to
stay in the home that I grew up in
because that's where I felt the most
comfortable my dad was in the process of
looking for a home he really wanted to
move to Tampa
just kind of like get away from
everything which I totally understood I
did not like going back home at all for
that reason so one day um I was staying
at my house my dad's house with my
grandma and he left on his motorcycle my
dad rides a motorcycle he left on his
harley-davidson to go to Tampa to see a
property to see like a certain house and
I remember sitting in my room like Pluto
in the mirror and playing with a Sedona
lace eyeshadow palette and my friend
America had just come over and then
around 3:00 in the morning I got a huge
knock on the door like a crazy bang and
my grandmother opened the door and there
were two cops standing right in front of
me and my the cop was like oh are you
the mother of Eddie my dad and she was
like yeah he was like he was in a really
terrible motorcycle accident and I
remember looking at the cop and I asked
him um is he alive like that's the only
thing I asked and the guy was like I
don't know and I kind of like don't
remember what happened after that I
remember like throwing myself on the
floor like not being able to breathe and
then my friend America was like let's go
get in my car I'm taking you to Tampa
because it happened in Tampa so we had
to drive - it was like four hour drive
over like a three-hour drive we had to
drive to Tampa General Hospital and we
met up with my uncle and my aunt there
and I remember when we got there
everybody he was in intensive care and
everybody who walked in um to see my dad
walked out like sobbing hysterically and
I was like I'm not going in there I'm
not gonna go in there and they were like
going through that's your dad what if
that's the last time you're able to see
him fall and I was like well if it is
the last time I'm gonna see him I want
the memory to be a good one and him not
cut up in his face or anything like that
so I'm not going in there my dad would
not want me to go in there and see him
so a couple days later we were still in
Tampa and he was recovering really well
actually
it was they have the best doctors there
or something because his recovery
happened really fast and really good and
my dad ended up having a traumatic brain
injury a TBI so long story short after
about a week he got home he had to wear
a neck brace and stuff
and he looked perfectly fine like
besides the neck brace physically it's
like nothing happened to him but the you
know TBI is pretty pretty serious so a
couple days later my dad started acting
really really strange he was acting
really weird seeing really weird things
and you know out of respect for my dad
I'm not gonna go into detail but I got I
got ugly my dad wasn't wasn't like I
don't know he was acting like a
completely different man and I remember
like the scariest stuff would happen it
was right I couldn't sleep I couldn't
sleep I remember around my dad's
accident I didn't sleep for weeks and
then we ended up finding out that his
brain was bleeding internally and nobody
knew because you know what's in his head
nobody had no one knew so he went back
to the hospital and then you know things
got better um I don't want to I don't
want to like disrespect him and talk
about this so I don't know I feel we
were talking about it but he ended up
going back home and he's fine um right
now he's doing great um he still has TBI
that doesn't go away I mean not that
nothing he still has like TBI like a
brain injury he doesn't anymore but for
example he has like short-term memory
loss like he'll be talking to you and
he'll be like yeah because you know
sitting down and how something like what
was I just talking about you know like
he has short-term memory loss so um
thank God thank God because there's no
one else I could possibly think that my
dad is alive and well to this day thank
you God because hit was traumatizing it
was the worst year of my life the
divorce happened and then right after
that you know my dad's accident happened
and during the accident the divorce was
still going on because it takes a long
time to get divorced like I swear it was
like the longest process ever for my
parents to finally get divorced and it
was still it was ugly and they till this
day they can't even see each other like
I don't babe so after the accident you
know things were okay I had to Danny was
back from deployment I went I came back
to Mississippi and everything was fine
then Danny had to go on deployment again
and
when I went back to Miami for some
reason this time all the memories of
like the accident the divorce I like it
was like it weighed on top of me the
whole time that I was there and then I
remember it was September 16 September
September 16th
Danny was on deployment I remember
waking up and it couldn't breathe I woke
up not being able to breathe so my mom
took me to the hospital and he was like
here here take some xanax
I took some xanax it made it worse I had
to go back to hospital again that day
because xanax it made it worse I really
felt like I was having a seizure when I
was taking dennah it's not a real
seizure but I felt super jittery I
didn't like it and then it didn't stop
for an entire month 30 days or like 35
days around there I had anxiety from the
moment I woke up to the moment I went to
sleep and since I wasn't used to that I
really I thought it was the end of the
world it was bad I've always been the
type of person who had what is it called
social anxiety or like general
situational anxiety growing up I never
liked to go out partying I didn't like
to go to a club I didn't like to be
around places where there were so many
people I've had paranoia issues since I
was younger it had nothing to do with
like anything that happened with my
parents but I've always been just a
strange individual since I was really
young so I didn't like to go out but
every time my friends would like
persuade me to go somewhere and there
were a lot of people I would get anxiety
but the second that I would leave the
party or the place my anxiety would go
away so that was the kind of anxiety
that was super easy to deal with for me
because I knew what the problem was it
was the fact that I was at a party with
too many people and I knew how to fix
that leave the party so I knew how to
solve the problem so it was really easy
for me to deal with that I never really
cared about that kind of anxiety but
this anxiety happens and I would wake up
with it and go to sleep when I wake up
with a go sleep with it and I didn't
know how to solve the problem so it gave
me more anxiety and I felt like I
couldn't breathe I would go to the
hospital very often because I felt like
an elephant was sitting on my chest
my dad was like you really need to see
someone you need to go to a psychologist
you know so I did ended up going to
psychologist a really great one I'm
really lucky that I have a really good
psychologist and you know she was
telling me like you have really bad
anxiety
so I ended up seeing a psychiatrist
psychologist kind of talked to you about
your problems and psychiatrists
prescribed medication and when I went to
my psychiatrist he basically told me I
had anxiety with panic disorder
I forgot general anxiety I forgot it was
general anxiety with panic disorder
because I would have panic attacks very
very often like throughout that whole
month like I was just like not being
able to breathe and like freak out and I
would have panic attacks so he gave me
like two pills one that I was supposed
to take on a daily basis and one that I
would only take when I had a panic
attack and I took this one that I was
supposed to every day for about a month
and hated it I felt so bad I was like
I'm not going to be a slave to a pill
I'm not gonna do this I'm gonna conquer
this on my own
if this pill I'm not going to do it so I
throw away those pills and I only kept
the ones that would calm me down if I
had a panic attack so whenever I have
really really really bad anxiety or a
panic attack I take that pill and then I
feel a lot better so that pill stays
with me in my purse at all times because
it really really helps me but I decided
I wasn't going to do the pill everyday
thing because I was stronger than that
at least that's what I told myself so
you know I would tell my psychologist
like I don't understand what's happening
and she basically brought it out and
told me you know like having that
traumatic experience of your parents
divorce and your dad's accident
happening so close together it's called
it caused the anxiety but the second you
left it's like you left all that behind
so you didn't feel they bother you but
when you came back down to Miami and all
the memories hit you like a ton of
bricks it triggered your anxiety and
that's when it really really hit you
which made so much sense
because um I loved Miami all my friends
were there
I loved being with my dad like I loved
living with my dad I loved being there
with my dad I love it so much um I wish
I was there now I miss him
I kept like I kept replaying like the
accident in my head like whenever I
would look at his bike he doesn't ride
his bike anymore
thank God but it's sitting kind of like
in the house whenever I would look at
the bike I would think of the accident
whenever I would you know certain things
that I would look at would trigger those
memories and it was just it was bad I
really thought that I was going to feel
like that for the rest of my life and it
would scare me so bad I would time like
I don't want to feel like this for the
rest of my life I don't know what I'll
do if I wake up with anxiety for the
rest of my life I don't know what I will
do honestly my dad was the only one who
understood nobody else understood my
anxiety I didn't know anybody else who
had anxiety except my cousin but nobody
understood it and my and my
psychologists made a really really good
point which if you if any of you guys
have anxiety which I would think so if
you're watching this video but if any of
you guys have anxiety just keep this in
mind because it really really did help
me because I kept trying to explain to
people like certain people in my family
certain people in like certain group of
friends know you know I can't go out
because I have anxiety and my friends
were like you can't go out because you
have anxiety so you can't come hang out
with me because you haven't I do okay
yeah sure and my psychologist explains
it to me like no one is going to tell
that your foot is broken unless you have
a cast on it that's end that stayed with
me and really did help me because it's
true anxiety is a mental thing it's
something that happens inside so you
physically look perfectly fine but it's
something that's going on inside your
body so no one is going to understand it
because they don't feel the anxiety so
if there is one thing I can tell you
guys is do not try to explain anxiety
and other people they will make you feel
like you're crazy certain people will be
like okay they it's not there's no cast
on your foot so no one's going to know
your foot is broken so if you're really
feeling really really upset maybe talk
to a psychologist or talk to someone you
know is really really good at listening
and really is understanding because most
of the time people didn't understand
and that doesn't make you crazy that
doesn't make your problem any less of a
problem or any less important because
people don't get it that's not true so
one day after a lot of praying and a lot
of like hoping you know one day I woke
up and I didn't have anxiety after a
whole month and I was like oh my god I
don't feel so bad and I got some anxiety
that day but it wasn't a constant thing
for the whole day so that kind of woke
me up and I was like wait a minute I can
conquer this I can do this I can do this
so basically um what has helped me I
know that was super long I just wanted
to explain to you what caused my anxiety
but what really really helped me was
going to a psychologist you're not crazy
if you go to a psychology if you see a
therapist you are not crazy
some people don't believe in in therapy
and if you don't that's fine
um I think it helps that's just me
another thing is my psychologist told me
to really delete the bad things in your
life
delete the bad people I had some friends
who didn't understand who really kind of
poked fun at my anxiety and my
psychologist was like you really need to
get rid of those friends and surround
yourself with loving people people who
make you happy you know like the kind of
friends you have that when you're around
them you just feel really good so that's
what I did I started hanging out my
friend Gabby and Krista and they just
they got me they got me and I kind of
deleted certain people out of my life
who just sort oxic I'm we're drowning me
made me feel worse than I already felt
so if you have people like that in your
life try to delete them as hard as it's
going to be try to focus your energy on
happy people because people who give off
positivity you kind of like absorb the
positivity if you're around people who
are always happy and like a really
appreciate life and make you feel good
as a person you will feel good as a
person if that makes any sense also try
to break the habits I thought that if I
left my dad's house I would have anxiety
so I literally locked myself up in my
room and I watched charmed for a whole
month because my fear was oh my god as
soon as I leave this house I'm gonna get
anxiety I know that's what it is I'm
gonna get anxiety as soon as I leave
this house which wasn't true by the way
I have OCD so that played a major part
into that I thought that if I left my
house something bad what happened I
would have anxiety but anyway try to
break the habit you know force yourself
even though it's hard leaving the house
gives you anxiety for example I would
try to get in my car and then go down
the street drive down the street and
then drive back and then go back home
and I would and I would be like okay I
got in my car and I drove down the
street and you know I survived I didn't
have a panic attack so a little Y little
Y just kind of started going out more
and like seeing people more another
thing that really helped me was um
exercise like meditation kind of like
breathing exercises we would my me and
my psychologist down on the couch and
she would make me breathe in like hold
my breath and then breathe out wow that
really helps me a lot like every time I
have I'm having a panic attack on the
verge of a panic attack I do those
breathing exercises I breathe in hold my
breath for like 30 seconds or less that
seems like a lot and then I would
breathe out and you kind of feel your
heart kind of like calming down
breathing exercises really work regular
exercises really work because panic
attacks make my heart beat really really
fast when I would go jogging you know
your heart races really fast when you're
jogging but it's a different kind of
heartbeat I'm not explain it jogging
really really helped it keeps your mind
off of the anxiety and you know the
endorphins and all that stuff it really
helps anxiety another thing is don't eat
too much fast food because while I was
going through really bad anxiety
I would eat fast food all the time and I
found it made it worse when I would eat
like at my sister's house and I would
eat healthier food I felt more relaxed
and it wouldn't give me anxiety so bad
foods can give you anxiety believe it or
not
another thing I
and is writing if you don't like to
write then that's a different story but
right in your journal
happy things write down things that make
you happy but that you can go back and
read them and then appreciate your life
more actually had a journal that I kept
while my parents were going through the
divorce and while my dad had the
accident I had to burn the journal I
literally had to set my journal on fire
because reading it caused so much pain
because I wasn't so much pain as I was
writing it anybody who would read that
journal would have thought that I was
like dying worse like the worst life
ever because I would just write all the
really bad emotions and I had to get rid
of that journal so I recommend writing
down happy thoughts if you want to have
a journal to write down you like all of
the pain you're feeling that's fine but
then have a sever one to write all your
happy thoughts and happy memories in
because go back and you read it and it
kind of makes you think like you know
what my life isn't that bad so yeah just
try to think about happy things and I
know that everybody says that but it is
true positivity is so important when you
have anxiety because I feel like it
brings the light to your life those are
just things that really helped me until
this day I will have the occasional
panic attack and I have anxiety like
I've had anxiety this entire video but
I'm able to live my life because I know
it is temporary keeps it in your mind at
all times
I'm not going to feel like this forever
I have a panic attack but guess what
I'll take something or I'll drink
something or I'll do something that will
make me feel better and then it'll be
gone and it'll be in the past this is a
temporary thing I had to write really
big on my wall this too shall pass I
wrote it with paint on my wall in my
bedroom and I kept telling myself like
this too shall pass this too shall pass
cuz it will well your pain will not last
you forever it really will not I promise
you I thought I was gonna die because I
woke up with anxiety for 35 days and it
didn't go away and I thought okay this
is what the rest of my life is gonna
look like but it's not it isn't there is
a light at the end of the tunnel I hope
you understand that I hope I promise you
that you will not feel like this forever
and the more you
yourself that like you know what this is
temporary this is temporary I could do
this I'm strong enough to to conquer
this then the faster you will heal or
the faster you'll feel better yeah I'm
gonna wrap this video up because I feel
like it is 35 minutes long maybe longer
I don't know I kind of just wanted to
share with you guys you know there
there's good in life and there's a lot
of bad things in life and there's a lot
of things that cause anxiety and then
you feel like you really are rock-bottom
and you feel the worst that you could
possibly feel and you feel like you
cannot breathe and you cannot go
anywhere or be around anyone without
having a panic attack but that's not
true this too shall pass and you'll feel
better
I promise just you know try to do the
certain little things that I said and
check if that works my advice is not the
best I'm sure that people other people
will give you better advice but this is
just how I was able to deal with my
anxiety and yeah I hope this helped at
least one person probably didn't but I
hope it did thank you guys so much for
watching I love you guys I love you guys
so much please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
