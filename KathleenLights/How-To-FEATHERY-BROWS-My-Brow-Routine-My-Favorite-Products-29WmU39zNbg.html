an eyebrow routine flash tutorial I
haven't done one of these videos in a
really long time and it's been so so so
highly requested to do recently that I
thought of close I'll give it to you
guys I have a notebook in my desk where
I write down all of the things have been
requested and I was looking through in
the notebook yesterday and at the
publiced I was like updated feathery
brow routine and I just thought it was
time to do it I have a video similar to
this it's actually called like my
feathery brow tutorial or something like
that but I believe that video was filmed
two years ago I think I think I posted
that like two years ago so it's been a
while and although it's still a similar
look it's still a feathery brow tutorial
I still use different things and
different techniques and I really wanted
to do this video mainly because you guys
never see me do my brows on camera I
would you do them off camera because
it's a bit of a process you will see in
a second and this is like a specific
tutorial on how to achieve a feathery
brow look where it looks a little bit
bushy and a little undone and a little
more natural I'm not a huge fan of the
brows that look really really fake and
super clean I know a lot of people like
to outline their brows with concealer to
clean them up I do think that's nice
I've done that in the past for the most
part I find the Instagram brows would be
a little bit too harsh for me personally
please don't be offended if that's those
are the brows you like to do still think
they're beautiful but for me this is
what I like to do it's still a bold brow
because I get told every day that my
brows are too bold so it's still a bold
brow it's just a little bit more
feathery and more bushy and it's been a
little bit of a journey for me because I
don't have thick brows those of you out
there who literally don't even have to
fill in their eyebrows my friend gabby
is like that she has the most perfect
fake brow she doesn't even have to fill
them in and I'm like how oh why are your
brows so lucky that is definitely not
the case for me I have to work with mine
for them to look bold I mean I posted
pictures in the past I will show you
guys here I grew up without any eyebrows
my eyebrows didn't come in until high
school and even then they're not super
prominent but thank you so much to those
of you who tell me that I have rebels
you have no idea how happy that makes me
feel so anyway enough rambling if you
want to see my updated feathery brow
routine then just keep watching okay so
I don't know about you guys but for me
my least favorite part of my makeup is
doing my brows which is funny because I
love brows and it's like the first thing
I noticed when someone's wearing makeup
but I hate the process of filling in my
eyebrows but it is the very first step
in my makeup and I always get questions
about that like why do I do my brows
first instead of doing my foundation
first and I totally see where
everybody's coming from when you already
have your brows on getting around your
brows with your foundation can be a
little bit difficult but in my opinion
is just easier for me to do my brows
first because sometimes I will mess up
and I will have to like wipe away half
of my brow and I just prefer to do it
like on my bare skin so I always do my
brows first and I'm also not somebody
who really likes brow pomade I tried
them before in the past but for me they
just look a little bit too unnatural and
I just struggle with pomades I've never
really found a palmate I really really
like that I've tried so many I prefer a
brow pencil there are a few I really
like and I want to mention all of them
today I just want to give you all my
brow info in this video since I never
discussed them my top favorite high-end
brow pencils are these guys right here
the Anastasio brow is is probably one of
my favorite brow is that I've been using
this for years when I first got into
makeup the first brought pencil I ever
bought was the UH Nastasia brows I've
always used the shade dark brown but I
discovered yesterday in my collection
that I actually own soft brown as well I
also really love the Dior brow Siler
pencil this is another twist up it's
very very similar to the Anasazi one and
I've also really been loving the benefit
precisely my brow I believe this is my
third one I've gone through two of these
I love this also really similar to the
brow is I like the formula to be in
between a little creamy and a little
waxy I don't like my formula to be too
waxy or too creamy that smudges
everywhere I like it the perfect
in-between if you are looking for a good
drugstore eyebrow pencil these are the
ones I recommend my favorite favorite
drugstore one has to be the NYX micro
brow pencil I'm in the shade brunette I
love this one this one is really close
to the brow is as well it's really
really good it's that perfect in-between
consistency the formula is really nice
another great one I just don't have it
with me is the Loreal brow stylist
definer I think that's what it's called
I ran out of it and then I never
repurchase it because I have so many
brow pencil but that one is actually
really really close to the auto-fire
brow is but it also have been loving
this one I just recently discovered it
not so long ago this is the LA girl
Shady slim brow pencil this one is just
a little bit waxy er than the Anastacio
one but I don't find it hard to work
with I actually really like it and then
this one is the creamiest out of all of
them this is the elf instant list brow
pencil this one is a little bit thicker
than the other ones it's not as precise
but I actually really really like I
think this is my second one it's so easy
to use sometimes I don't want to sit
there and take a million hours on my
brows and because of the formula of this
one it's just so easy to apply I don't
think it lasts as long as my Auto
fluffier broadway's I really like this
one if you are into more of a creamier
brow pencil color pop has a really nice
one as well I also use that one from
time to time and yeah those are my
favorite brow pencils but today I'm
going to be using the benefit precisely
my brow but if it also has a different
brow pencil that's called the goof proof
I used to love that one and when I first
discovered these that one was my
favorite
but then I started to notice on my brows
it was just looking a little bit too
harsh I was into the whole angled tip
for a while on a saucy I came out with
one but now I'm back to the precise
pencils I just I realized I like these
more so enough rambling let's get on
with it
so a lot of the times I struggle to
match my brows exactly because as you
can see this one is just naturally a
little bit higher than this one this is
my good brow you know everybody has that
bra they prefer to fill in this is my GU
brow and you know sometimes they don't
look identical and that's okay your
brows are supposed to be sisters not
twins
always remember that don't get too
frustrated if they're looking just
slightly off because no one's going to
notice you're fine so the first thing I
do is I take the spoolie end and I brush
it through my rows just so that they are
combed out and then I just take the tip
of the brow pencil and I fill in my
brows you see me do this a few times
spread up on tutorials and stuff so it's
not something that's revolutionary we've
seen people fill in their eyebrows 100
times but I always start off here at the
front
I just wiggle my brush around here at
the front and then I start creating kind
of
the shape of it at the bottom I make
that curve right there and then I use
that as my guideline
I don't extend my brow a little bit
longer and I do have some hair here at
the bottom I don't really fill in the
entire portion of the front of my brow
because I find that every time I do that
they just look way too fat and like
droopy here like they go down so I try
to keep it like as straight as possible
I prefer a more straighter brow that
curves like that so I just continue to
do that and then I start slowly dragging
it up and then I get up here at the
front I just kind of go along the shape
I don't extend it any further or
anything like that I literally go based
on the shape of my brow kind of sleeper
front like this until the very end
because it looks a little bit unnatural
there it looks like just like a stark
line I will go in and fix that in a
second let me just go ahead and finish
filling in the brows and then for my
brows since I have like this weird dip
up here have it on both brows it looks
like I have like some hair missing here
I just create that shape with the pencil
I make my brows thicker because if I
just filled them in exactly how they
were it would be like just like this and
I don't love that look I like them to
look a little bit longer a little bit
more rounded but that's just me so I
extend it out a little bit more and I
make the shape thicker all around not
just thicker here
so I kind of just make the tail thicker
than it is and now I'm just going to go
ahead and fill in this eyebrow really
quick and then I will come back and
finish this now that there are more or
less sisters this is the part where I
like to go in and make them look a
little bit more natural and feathery so
I just think my brow pencil and I brush
all my hairs up and when you do this you
notice that you have bald spots where
you didn't apply the brow pencil because
your brow hair was laying flat down and
in one direction so what I just do is I
grab the brow pencil and I just start to
make these brush like strokes all the
way across my brows and this makes it
look just a little Messier and the lines
on your brows don't look as harsh it
makes it look less perfect less neat if
I'm ever going to go out and I want my
brows just to be locked and loaded I
just set them down not all the time I
put the sake of this video I'm going to
do that this is the BOMs brow Pao it's
their eyebrow powder and I use the shade
light brown this is the brown powder I
have been using for like years now ever
since I discovered it I've gone through
an entire pan of this which is crazy now
I just take my royal and langnickel
brush this is the number 10 blush i
bought this at michaels years ago this
is the same eyebrow brush I've been
using forever I just take some of this
powder and I go over my entire brow with
this this not only fills in the rest of
the bolts box but I feel like it helps
set the brows or the brow pencil
and I do all of this while brushing
upwards and then what I do to the front
of my brow so they look a little bit
more natural and not as square I just
take this brush and I just start to
wiggle the front of my brow it makes it
look more faded and natural I don't take
any additional product on the brush I
just use what's already on my brows I'm
not sure you can tell on camera but in
person it just looks a little bit more
natural and that harsh line is like
faded away okay so this is my favorite
part this is where things get feathery
so ever since the first time I did this
feathery brow tutorial I have just been
in love with this trend and I have been
trying to find the perfect brow gel that
will give me that effect the entire day
because so many brow gels that I've
tried in the past they will give you
that feathery look in the beginning but
they will fall throughout the entire day
just like if right now all you did was
just brush your hairs up it gives you
that feather you look at first but when
you look in the mirror like two hours
later your brows and look further
anymore so I have found many options for
this the most traditional option
obviously would be brow gel and these
are my favorite ones my favorite
high-end brow gel is this one this is
the anastacio clear brow gel I have
tried many brow gels from different
brands at Sephora and none of them
except for the luxury one I'm going to
show you
none of them keep my brows looking
feathery all day they just don't last as
long they don't have that hold that
grips that this brow gel does this will
give you that feathery look and it kind
of just like glues your brows in that
direction they kind of feel a little
crispy I'm not going to lie you kind of
feel like you have something on your
brows but it's not something that
bothers me I think it's worth it if it's
going to keep your brows looking
feathery all day this is the Givenchy
mister brow room this is a clear brow
gel just like the anastacio one only it
has terrible terrible packaging because
it's see-through and you can see all the
gunk in this packaging and I absolutely
hate that that drives me mad I wished it
wouldn't make this in a solid packaging
so that I wouldn't see that because I
know that's what this looks like on the
inside but I don't see it so I like
pretend
it's not but besides that I love this
bra Joe it keeps my hairs in place all
day I absolutely love it but if you are
looking for a really amazing drugstore
brow gel I highly recommend this one the
lettering is like completely rubbed off
how much I use it this is the Loreal
brow stylist plumper this one resembles
the benefit gimme brow if you're
familiar with that one that has like
little fibers inside that help make your
brows look a little bit fuller this one
is the exact same way as the Gimme brow
I actually like this one more than the
Gimme brow sometimes I feel like
whenever I apply the Gimme brow
it applies too much product and I have
like a goop like right here and
sometimes it's hard to blend out this
one I find doesn't apply too much all at
once I will often use this when I don't
fill in my brows at all but I use this
to set my brows regardless of how filled
in they are those fibers don't stop me
so I absolutely love this one but if you
are someone who feels not even that is
enough if you just find your brow hairs
really do fall at the end of the day
even after trying those I would
recommend something like this
this is a hairspray and this is like a
hair pomade Bumble and Bumble sumo tech
low gloss and lasting molding compound
pretty much superglue for your hair I'm
sure you've seen a product like this for
years and years and years my brother
used to use this not this one but
something like this to like spike up his
hair and keep it hard all day so I just
started to use something like this for
my brows whenever I wanted to achieve
that feathery brow look a little bit
more dramatically or for a longer period
of time I'm not sure you can tell in the
tub but there are like some stab marks
here because the first time I want to
use this I try to rub the spoolie in it
and then use it that way and then uh no
big mistakes go all up in my spoolie it
got sticky it got crazy
so I pretty much just use it with my
fingers I will just rub my fingers in
this and then I will brush my hairs up
and it'll give that feathery look like
this is so sticky and that's pretty much
all I use this for that's why it looks
like it's barely been touched because I
just do a little bit but I also really
love to use hairspray for that it was
actually a little trick my mom taught me
she said is that when she was younger
she used to love feathery brows like it
was a thing back then too and she would
always use hairspray because they didn't
have brow gel or at least she didn't I'm
wrong so I'm just going to use a little
bit of hairspray you can use any
hairspray but I would reckon
and a strong hold hairspray with what
where is my head where is my head today
this is mousse I meant to grab my
hairspray hold on what how did I not
notice that I was holding a mousse what
I would recommend a strong hold
hairspray this is a medium hold
hairspray I cannot find my strong hold
hairspray anywhere which is probably why
I accidentally grabbed a notice instead
and yes I'm one of those people who has
a soft touchable hairspray a medium hold
hairspray and a super strong hold
hairspray I am that person and basically
I just spray this on my spoolie and then
brush my brows if you're uncomfortable
doing this I give you fear you're gonna
mess up your spoolie just use a
disposable one they sell those like at
the drugstore and yes
I just spray my foot and I get feathery
in his biatch now although I would love
to go out like this I do think that this
is a little bit too dramatic so I do
push them down a little bit forgot to
zoom you beggin
I do push them down just a little bit in
a second I will show you and some of you
might ask like is it okay to put
hairspray on your brows but I mean your
brow or hair and it's like it's
hairspray you see in cases like this
when I brush up my brows and there's
still some balding happening there I
just go in and fix it and then just
brush it up again okay and then once my
brows look like they you can go ahead
and leave them like this but I just kind
of toned them down a little bit like if
one hair sticking out crazy I would just
kind of brush them down just a bit for
the most part I keep them looking
feathery like this it's just what I like
and yeah this is how I do my brows I'm
going to go ahead and finish up the rest
of my makeup and then I will be right
back to say bye okay guys so that
