spur-of-the-moment video as you could
probably tell by my parents
I always think my hair looks fine enough
to film and then I sit down and look at
my hair in the viewfinder and I'm like
oh I look like I'm about to go perform
hips don't lie and I'm not wearing
earrings which I just realized you know
what's funny is that every time I don't
like I don't wear earrings my mom is
like can you go put on some earrings and
I'm like why why I don't want to wear
earrings today so I was just relaxing at
home and I decided to film a quick video
because I've gotten so many requests to
do something like this and it's
basically a video about how I get the
most of my lashes I'm gonna walk you
through my mascara routine and I know
that that sounds really extra like oh
like mascara routine it's not that
serious too many unnecessary steps I
know but I like doing this because let's
face it you guys know I don't wear
falsies everyday I just don't find them
so practical for day-to-day life for me
personally so if I can make my lashes
look as bold and dramatic and as long
and voluminous as I can that's what I'm
gonna do mainly when I am doing like I
makeup on days like today where I have
like no I make a bond like I have
something in my crease I'll just apply
my mascara without any of these extra
steps but if I want to get the most of
my lashes this is what I do now before I
get started I know this intros really
long but I just want to let you guys
know I have pretty decent lashes already
like my eyelashes are pretty long I
don't have I mean I wouldn't say they're
super long but I don't have very short
stubby lashes and they do have a decent
natural curl to them but even if you do
have like smaller lashes or different
lashes than me maybe this video will
still help you anyway and I am gonna
show you the difference because on this
eye I'm just going to apply mascara like
just put on mascara nothing to it and
then on this eye I'm gonna do like the
extra steps and show you the difference
so the mascara I'm gonna be using today
is the Kiko Milano extra scope Volume
Mascara I talked about this in my
favorites video last month and I cannot
get enough of this I bought it on the
website and then I fell in love I bought
like three backups I love this it's $14
so I wouldn't say it's the cheapest it's
not as cheap as like a Milani mascara
a covergirl mascara Maybelline you know
those but it's not as expensive as like
Mac and like Sephora you know so I'm
gonna apply this mascara to this lash
right here and then I'm going to zoom
you in and start like the actual video
okay so I've just applied two coats of
the Kiko mascara to this eye if you're
wondering about this it is kind of a
clumpy mascara it is a very volumizing
formula so keep that in mind the brush
looks really similar to the better than
sex mascara I feel and it is kind of
like a drier formula which is why it's a
little bit clumpy it's a natural like
fiber wand not rubber by the way please
ignore my eyebrows I'm trying to let
them grow out as much as they can like
get really really bushy too then like do
them try let them grow up ignore them
they look so step number one is
definitely to curl your lashes it is
very very very important if you want
your mascara to hold a curl my favorite
eyelash curler are these right here
these are the tweezerman eyelash curlers
I bought mine on the Sephora website and
these are just the regular ones I know
that they come in like all different
shapes or whatever this is just the
original the other eyelash curler I
highly recommend is the Shu moral one it
is twenty dollars which is pretty crazy
but I swear it makes a difference just
like this one does this one isn't the
cheapest either but I totally see a
difference it does not pull my lashes
and it curls them really well I love it
a drugstore one that I actually do like
is the Revlon one so I'm just going to
start curling my lashes and I like to
get really really close as close as I
can without pinching myself to the base
of my lashes and then start to like pump
it like this and then let go and you
could totally see a difference look at
that maybe I should zoom you in a little
better you can already tell how well it
curled my lashes compared to how they
were before okay so my next step is
definitely a primer the same way you
prime your eyeshadows so that they last
all day and the same way you prime your
face so that your foundation lasts all
day I highly recommend you try eyelash
primers so that they really intensify
your eyes my favorite one is the Estee
Lauder little black primer eye all
about this one on Sephora the Lancome
sales booster is the one I was using
before this that one is really really
good too just like this one a little bit
more but they're both amazing
this one isn't white like most primers
it's like a black color so I'm going to
apply a thin coat of the eyelash primer
so I don't know if you can tell but I
can totally see that it has already made
my lashes longer than this one this lash
primer helps to lengthen your lashes and
also it sets them so that they keep the
curl and they just last longer I did
turn off my camera and wait for this to
dry because I go in one more time with
my eyelash curler and I just do it
softly I don't hold it there like for a
long time just softly to give it one
more judge and now I go in with my Kiko
extra sculpt volley mascara I'm going to
do two coats of this this one is already
drying out a little bit so it's not as
good as it once was but now
now if you find that your mascara gets a
little bit too clumpy when doing these
steps I really really really suggest
this this is the morphe b71 brush be
careful you'll stab yourself in the eye
that would hurt this is like a club
killer if your eyelashes are clumping
this you just pass the comb through your
lashes and it gets rid of all clumps I
love it but you know me sometimes I like
a little bit of clumpiness so I'm gonna
leave it now I'm gonna go off-camera and
wait for this to completely dry and I'm
talking about like 100% no tackiness I
need it to dry completely and then I'll
be right back okay so it's been like 20
minutes and my mascara has completely
dried I wait that long because I curl
them one last time and I know that a lot
of people say like do not curl your
lashes once mascara is already on them
and I totally agree unless your mascara
is 100% dry so I wait like a full 20
minutes I've been doing this for years
since I was in high school and I've
never ripped out a lash I try to be very
very very careful with this step so if
you're gonna do it please be as careful
as you can because if your mascara isn't
completely dry and you go to curl then
your eyelash can get stuck to this and
you can pull out your lashes so please
be careful and make sure that your
mascara is totally dry and not only that
when I do do this step I don't sit there
and bounce my lash curler back and forth
like I do initially in the beginning I
just do it really really quickly you'll
see I make sure all my lashes are
completely in here and then I just hit
it one time like that like barely
anything but I find that it makes such a
difference oh and I know that my lashes
looks so crazy right now like spidery
but when I have like a full glam makeup
on like when I have a shadow and I have
like the whole shebang they actually
look really really nice they don't look
crazy they just look crazy right now
because I don't have any eye makeup on
so here's a side-by-side comparison this
is just the mascara alone and this is
taking those extra steps that I showed
you I see a huge difference and I highly
recommend doing these steps with
products you have at home like your own
eyelash primer or your own mascara your
own eyelash curler I think that no
matter
you use it will still help you doing
these extra steps okay guys so that
completes this video I hope you guys
enjoyed this is not your style I totally
understand I remember you know we all
like different things and I personally
like it thank you guys so much for
