all about my hair how I keep it so long
and how I maintain it this long and how
I try to keep it as healthy as I can and
all my favorite haircare products I'm
going to go through everything from
washing my hair to what I do after I
wash my hair a couple of people have
asked me for our haircare routine so
that's what I'm going to do really
quickly though I want to say that it was
a beautiful sunny day today until I
decided to film this video I pressed
record and the Sun vanished the Sun is
coming in and out so I'm sorry if it
looks a little grey sometimes sorry
about that
there's a guy like popping wheelies in
front of my window on his motorcycle I
don't know the world just didn't want me
to film today but I'm gonna do it anyway
I do have a few things to share with you
so I want to go ahead and get into it
but really quickly I want to describe my
hair type to you guys I have very very
fine hair it's extremely thin and it
gets tangled immediately like I will
brush my hair and I will sneeze and then
my hair is tangled again it's ridiculous
how fast it gets tangled it's also
extremely puffy like Simba status its it
gets big and I have naturally curly hair
um throughout the years I used to iron
my hair all the time in high school like
almost every single day and doing that
so many years just kind of killed my
curls I don't have the curls I used to
have like in middle school or even when
I was younger my hair was really really
curly like Shirley Temple status it was
insane what that meeting said I still
have really curly hair it's just not as
good as it used to be but it's not
straight by any means so yeah
curly hair very fine very puffy let's
get on with it okay so I'm going to
start off with shampoo and conditioner
now I will say that this changes all the
time I'm still on the hunt for like my
perfect shampoo and conditioner I still
haven't found that yet so I alternate
between different shampoos and
conditioner I don't like using the same
ones over and over again so I have about
three or four different shampoos and
conditioner in my bathroom and I
alternate between them just because I
don't want my hair to get used to the
shampoo and conditioner okay so when I
used to dye my hair all the time
I still dye my hair
haven't died my roots in months because
my hairstylist my mother is in Miami
where I used to live and I don't live
there anymore and I just don't feel
comfortable with anybody dyeing my hair
but you know I had to put my big-girl
panties on because I'm looking a little
crazy but anyway my favorite shampoo and
conditioner for when I was color
treating that my hair is the red can
color extend shampoo and conditioner I
love these because my hair did not fade
at all when I dyed my hair it kept it
extremely vibrant for weeks and weeks
the conditioner is really nice too it's
just a really good shampoo conditioner
if you're color treating your hair so
when I get my hair dyed again I will go
back to these so the other shampoo and
conditioner I use is the when by Chaz
Dean sweet almond cleansing conditioner
this is expensive
I didn't buy this Dainese grandmother
gave it to me so that's why I use it
because it is kind of expensive but it
is very good I'd leave my hair really
soft and I feel like it was a good job
cleaning my hair and doesn't strip my
hair it's sulfate free which is really
good I probably will not buy this when I
run out of it because I've seen some
reviews on others that are cheaper and
pretty much do the same thing but
basically it's just like my sulfate free
moisturizing shampoo conditioner that I
use it makes my hair really soft with
that being said I do not wash my hair
every single day this is a huge part of
my hair care routine and why I feel like
my hair is as healthy as it is and why
I've managed to keep it as long as it is
it's because I don't wash my hair every
day it's not going to wash your hair
every day it just it strips your hair
and the more you wash your hair the more
heat you're going to be putting on it
because I heat style my hair every
single time that I wash it so if I
washed it every day I would be heat
styling every day so what I do is I wait
about four days to wash my hair and I
know that
might seem crazy but it has kept my hair
as healthy as it is try to go an extra
day without washing hair I promise you
will see a difference in your hair in
the long run trust me on this trust me
with that being said dry shampoo is
going to be your best friend
you just spray it in your hair on like
third day here and it takes up all the
oils and it looks like you just washed
your hair and it gives you a little bit
of volume I love dry shampoo the batiste
is my favorite one it just helps me go
an extra day without washing my hair so
that's why I love it so anyway back to
shampoos and conditioners
like I said they alternate I still
haven't found one that's completely
life-changing um when I do I will let
you know oh protein I'm sorry I seem
scatterbrained it's just a lot to talk
about um do not use too much protein in
your hair protein is really good if you
have damaged hair which a lot of people
have because a lot of us hits down light
hair but if you have a shampoo with
protein in it and you wash your hair
every single day or every other day
you're actually going to do the exact
opposite and your hair is going to feel
like straw and it's going to put too
much protein in your hair and it's
actually going to break your hair off so
I suggest using a shampoo with protein
in it and use it twice a week to help
strengthen your hair but do not use it
more than twice a week you can tell if a
shampoo has protein in it because on the
back it will say like hydrolyzed wheat
protein or whenever like it says like
hydrolyzed that's an indication approach
okay enough of a shampoo conditioner
let's talk about hair masks this is my
favorite part of my hair care routine so
I have three to share with you guys I
think any hair mask on the market is
good but these are just three of my
favorites
the first one is the L'Oreal total
repair 5 damage erasing balm I've talked
about this millions of times repairs up
to one year of damage in one use I don't
know about that
but it makes my hair ridiculously soft
to the point where I still feel like I
have conditioner in my hair even though
I rinse it all out it's that soft I'm
like no how is it possible makes my hair
extremely soft I love it so much
smells incredible I'm obsessed with the
smell of this
ah smells great and it's just an amazing
mask for about five dollars I will say
that I use this in place of like
conditioner sometimes whenever I feel
like my hair needs a little bit more oaf
I will use this instead of my
conditioner I just put it in my hair and
I'll shave my legs you know do a bunch
of other stuff and then I'll rinse it
out and my hair is 100% the other masks
that I really love is the red can
extreme builder plus it's just this red
can one in a blue little tin doesn't
smell as good as the other one but
doesn't smell bad it smells pretty good
and it is this blue goop stuff this is
the mask I use when I feel like my hair
is probably like at its worst like it
needs a huge pick-me-up because it has
protein in it and it just like
strengthens my hair and it does wonders
for my hair I love this I know how much
this is it's more expensive than this
but um I still think it's worth it and
the next thing isn't really a hair mask
but I use it as a hair mask and it is
coconut oil this is the game changer
folks coconut oil will save your hair I
know what I'm telling you please make
sure that it's the pure extra virgin
like organic 100% organic coconut oil
just because the other one can leave
your hair greasy this doesn't matter oh
I'm telling it because it smells like
coconut now while I use these kind of
like in place of conditioner sometimes I
use this right before I wash my hair I
will put it on like an hour before I'm
gonna wash my hair and I put it from
root to tip i coat my entire head with
this and ieave it on for an entire hour
and then I'll go wash my hair and my
hair feels like I can tell you the
dramatic difference this makes on your
hair it makes your hair shiny ow it
feels so much smoother so much silky or
so much more manageable it's just
amazing for you
okay now I'm going to talk about what I
do when I get out of the shower this
step is really important too because
even if you have the best conditioner in
the world if you just use the best hair
mask on the market you wash that off so
you use it your hair absorbs it but then
you wash it off you need something that
you're going to put in your hair and
you're gonna leave it in your hair so
that's what I'm gonna talk about now
I just finished washing my hair I get
out of shower I do not comb my hair when
it's wet I just don't like to do that
but if you're gonna do that my tip is to
use a wide tooth comb so anyway I do let
my hair air dry um I have a blow-dryer
but I honestly I only use it to blow-dry
Cornelius's hair after I take him a bath
because um I just don't want double the
heat on my hair unless you're in a hurry
and you really need to go out the door
you have to blow-dry her and then use a
flat iron or a curling iron I understand
you know what can you do but if you have
time to sit at home and lay your hair
air-dry do it because that's less heat
you're going to be putting on your hair
which results in less damage so after my
hair is about 50% dry I will go in with
my leave-in products if you saw my June
favorites you know I went on and on and
on about the Frederic Fekkai brilliant
glossing cream I'm not going to go on
and on about it again but this is my
little holy grail product it's a
leave-in cream I do like leaving cranes
more than leave-in sprays I just
personally think that they work better
than the sprays but of course that's
just my opinion I used to really really
love the read can smooth down butter
treat I mean I still do but they
discontinued the smooth down line so I
had to go on the hunt for something that
was just as good and I found something a
little better um this is like I said the
brilliant glossing cream I put it in my
hair I work a tiny pea sized amount in
my palm like I'm talking about like this
big tiny this thing will last ages
ridiculous um I put I work it into my
hands and then I well I do this first I
split my hair I stood my hair like this
and then I work it into my hands and
then I will just drag it down my hair
and then kind of
get in the end I'll take a little bit
and then work it in my banks because my
bangs get really really frizzy but yeah
this stuff is amazing it makes my hair
so incredibly soft like I can run my
fingers through my hair and I couldn't
say that before because my hair gets
knotted so easily and this has changed
that and it also gives an amazing shine
to my hair guess that's why it's called
brilliant glossing it just makes your
hair look nice and glossy it's fantastic
now in conjunction to that I have found
thanks to it see something that my hair
loves and it is the healthy sexy hair
soy renewal nourishing styling treatment
I have showed this in one of my
favorites videos I haven't maybe like
one more drop left and then I have to go
buy the full size this is a frizzy
girl's best friend
after I'm done putting this in my hair I
will take like I said another pea sized
amount and work it into the bottom half
of my hair I do not put it towards the
top just in the bottom half of my hair
and my hair just is like a lot less
frizzy and it's a lot more smooth and
honestly when I use these two products
in conjunction I have no desire to use a
flat iron or a curling iron my hair just
looks really pretty natural and it's
thanks to these two products so I love
those if you're wondering what I have in
my hair whenever my hair is like curly
and wild and out of control that you
have in some of my videos it's just
these two products no gel no mousse nada
another product I love using in my hair
when I get out of the shower it's the
red can extreme anti snap and I have the
little one that's like three dollars
because this lasts forever I had this
for about six months and I still have a
ton of uses in there because I only work
a tiny drop into my hands and then I
will massage it in my on my ends I only
use this products on my tips and I don't
use this every time I wash my hair
because you know it has protein in it
which I wash my hair every 4 days so
it's not that serious but I use it every
other wash and I just work it on my tips
and I know it sounds crazy I know it's
gonna sound really crazy but I kind of
feel my ends coming together
like I can tell the difference I know
you can't repair split ends once your
ends are split like you know they split
you have to cut them there's nothing you
can do but using this working this in my
ends I feel a noticeable difference and
it really helps my split ends if you
have split ends a lot of them check this
product out they sell it at Ulta I don't
think you'll regret it now when it comes
to heat styling my hair I use to heat
protectants these are my two favorite
heat protectants one is new to me which
I know this is extremely old but it's
new to me and one I've had it forever
this is the red can smooth down heat
glide I know I love red can my mom has
used red can my hair since I was a
little girl so I just I really gravitate
towards red can but anyway this
unfortunately like I said is
discontinued the smooth down line is
discontinued and now it's like smooth
LOC or something I don't know but I love
this heat protectant because it has
macadamia oil in it so this is kind of
what I use as a serum you know like a
shine serum in my hair whenever my hair
feels a little bit dull I pump this into
my hand
and I will put it all over my hair and
it makes my hair like insanely shiny
like if I just got it styled with at the
salon kind of shiny shiny but for just
like a regular heat protectant I really
really like this Tresemme one um since
it's like a mist I feel like it just
smells amazing by the way
smells amazing I feel like it evenly
coats my hair like every inch of my hair
um it gets protected by the heat okay so
those are all the products I use in my
hair I use all these things religiously
they are my favorite hair care products
tried-and-true amazing products really
quickly though I just want to give you
some tips on what to do if you want to
let your hair grow I've been letting my
hair grow since middle school
um I've had my hair long for quite some
time now and what I would say is just
get your hair trimmed every three months
I know a lot of people don't believe
that
your haircut often helps your hair grow
but it really does because the more you
let your hair just grow without cutting
it off the more split ends you're going
to get end up just going to go up and up
and up and up and up and your split ends
are going to just take over your hair
and then you're going to have to chop it
all off kind of defeats the purpose of
growing your hair not doesn't it so just
get it trimmed every three months use a
heat protectant let your hair air-dry
instead of blow-drying it I mean if you
can because the less heat damage you
have in your hair obviously the less
often you have to go and get like these
large trims you know because you won't
have as many split ends if you don't use
that much heat obviously so yeah that's
it I don't think I missed anything I
don't know if you have any questions um
leave it down below and I'll answer all
your questions but yeah this is just the
routine I use on my hair and I've
managed to keep my hair as long as I
have it and yeah that's it I hope you
enjoyed this video I hope it wasn't too
long and I hope you learned something or
you try out some of these products thank
you so much for watching guys and I will
see you in my next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
