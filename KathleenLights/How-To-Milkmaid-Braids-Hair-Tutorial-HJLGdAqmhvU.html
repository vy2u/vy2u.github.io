a really quick hair tutorial I actually
just finished filming this makeup
tutorial so if you want to see how to
get this look I will link um the
tutorial down below it's a full face
drugstore but I just finished filming
this and I was realizing that I got an
overwhelming amount of requests to do
the milkmaid braids that I posted on
Instagram and that I was wearing in my
March favourites so that is what I'm
going to do for you today I wasn't gonna
for me because there's like a hundred
tutorials on YouTube on how to do this
frame so I thought it would just be
stupid to repeat my or like to do it
since so many people do it but it was
requested and I like you guys you're my
friends so I'm gonna do it for you so
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is brush your hair completely so that
there are no knots in your hair this
hairstyle typically works to like four
medium length to long hair um I don't
exactly know how this would look on
really short hair I don't think it might
work so you're gonna brush out your hair
because it's a lot easier to braid your
hair when there are no knots in your
hair obviously obviously you're going to
want to part your hair down the middle
it doesn't have to be perfect or
anything like that
and then you're just gonna do these and
I like to leave like two strands out
because I feel like the braid looks
really awkward when I don't but it looks
kind of ugly on me when I do that
because I don't have bangs and I just
have really long strips uh-huh
but whatever I do it anyway because if I
don't it looks super awkward so I like
to take some hair out and leave it
towards the front like this if you have
bangs this would actually look really
cute like if your bangs are like up to
here like if they're half this and that
would look really cute okay so before I
start braiding what you're going to need
are two little elastics for your hair I
recommend clear ones but I only have
black ones and then a bunch of bobby
pins and that's pretty much it
so I'm going to pull my hair out from
behind my ear and I'm going to grab it
like this and I'm just going to start to
braid a regular braid
and as you braid down you're going to
want to pull it because you want the
braid to be pretty tight so you're going
to make a tight braid
and just do that all the way down and
then secure it with an elastic if you
have a lot of layers in your hair it's
going to be a little bit difficult to do
this hairstyle but you can still do it
you're just going to need a lot more
bobby pins but it's not it's doable
where there's a will there's away my
friends and then I'm just going to do
the exact same thing on this side
you
okay so once you've done that you're
left with two little roids like this
like Matilda style when the girl gets
thrown over the fence you know the girl
I'm talking about she gets the flowers
anyway all you're going to do is you're
going to take the braids and you're just
going to do this and lay it right on top
of your head now this part is optional
you mean you could do it like further
back to it looks like a back crown or
really really close I like to do it like
somewhat in the middle right here and
you're just going to take your bobby pin
and pin this hair right down and I
definitely need more than one bobby pin
to pin that step and that's okay okay so
once you have that down you're going to
want to do the same thing on the other
side we're going to fix this little
fluffy fluffy thing later
so with this one you're going to want to
cover the elastic so you're going to go
like this and cover that elastic and
then go right behind it so you cover it
and then come right behind it and then
you're going to want to tuck this one
behind this braid so that it can cover
that elastic and then pin it down so you
don't want the elastic to show that's
why you kind of hide it under the braids
I kind of forgot to do that so you kind
of saw my elastic last time so once you
have that down you're just going to go
and fix all the weird pieces like this
okay so then that is pretty much it
you're left with the milkmaid braids and
now what I like to do is I like to curl
these especially since they're so long
and super awkward and ugly so I'm
actually thinking I'm gonna cut my bangs
a little bit or like cut more layers in
the front
those besides the point I'm gonna go
ahead and curl these little sections
here because I actually think it looks
really pretty with these braids in your
hair and then your little pieces in the
front curled so I'm going to take my
conner infinity so my string isn't long
enough to reach over here so I'm just
going to curl my hair away from my face
I'm not going to hold it for too long
and then I'm just going to let it go
because I want it to be a soft curl then
I'm going to do the same thing to this
one then I just go ahead and brush the
curls out so they could look a little
softer and more feminine and then that
completes this tutorial this is the
milkmaid braids I think they're really
pretty they're not for everyone
people either love this hairstyle or
they freaking hate it and I freaking
love it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
look I am not super big on hair
