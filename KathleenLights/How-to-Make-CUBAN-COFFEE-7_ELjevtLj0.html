welcome to my kitchen everyone this is
my mother and today we are going to film
a highly requested video a lot of you
guys have asked me to show how to make
Cuban coffee because you guys know I
drink it in like everyday all my videos
I'm always drinking Cuban coffee so my
mother is here to show you how to make
it we're gonna do two different ways
we're gonna show you the classic way how
to do it in like an original thing what
mom what is this called
like a bit of a woman cafe did I go on I
doubt that's the real name but what I
got my data if you love one we're gonna
show you how to do it in this which is
probably my favorite way to do it
because I feel like the coffee tastes
better when you do it here right the
coffee tastes better yeah
heresy shudder oh yeah and the best this
is about okay
let's like applica I move to people like
I said but yeah there's a lot of
different copies there's ballon ballon
busted' oh yeah but Estrella Avila this
is the best one you can find this I
catch winn-dixie your Publix Publix is
only a Florida thing so I don't know
where you guys would find any Dixie yeah
when I buy more Walmart they have this
when I lived in Mississippi they didn't
have this depending on where you live I
don't know if you can get this
everywhere this is very Hispanic cafe
lie of it so I don't know where you guys
who are not in Florida can get this
maybe on the bamas on or something but
this is my favorite way of it
this little hmm so first we're going to
show you how to do it in a class today
but Ernest in the classic coffee maker
so after we show you how to make it the
classic way my mom is going to teach you
how to make it in one of these things
this is a regular like coffee maker I
don't know what this is specifically
called you can get these pretty much
everywhere I think I see this at Bed
Bath and Beyond
and Walmart sound like that this is a
little bit more accessible than a
classic like keeping coffeemaker thing
like that silver thing so that's why
we're gonna teach you how to make it in
this as well okay we're going to start
off with the classic way to make Cuban
coffee in this type of coffee maker so
I'm taking a measuring cup or my mama's
but we're taking a measuring cup just so
you can see it's see-through so she
likes to take three spoonfuls of sugar
apply it to the measuring cup and then
you open up this coffee maker and you're
gonna apply water to the base of it so
here she's showing you that you
shouldn't pass this little screw when
you fill it up with water that's kind of
like a guideline don't pass the screw
you want to make sure that the water
comes a little bit underneath it so
we're filling it up with water you know
not letting it pass a little screw and
then we're going to apply that little
thing right on top and this is where the
coffee is going to go so she's taking
the coffee and applying it into this
little cup you want to make sure you're
packing it as you're applying it because
if not the coffee will come out very
watery you want to make sure it's
tightly squeezed like tightly packed the
coffee will come out a little bit
stronger that way then you tighten it up
make sure you tighten it real good
squeeze it in there and then you're
gonna place your stove on hot and apply
it apply it why do I keep saying apply
it and put it right on top of the stove
you want to make sure it's on a really
hot hot temperature okay and this part
is very very very important you want to
leave the coffeemaker a little bit open
so that you can see when the coffee is
coming out it's going to take a couple
of minutes but you're going to start
seeing steam come out of the coffee pot
and then you're going to see that stuff
come out this is the coffee it's very
important that you want to take the
first bit of coffee that comes out and
you want to pour some of it into your
sugar you want to get the perfect
consistency this is what we're going to
use to make the foam with this coffee
maker you have to make the foam by hand
so the beginning stages of the coffee
like when it starts to spew out take a
little bit of it pour it back into the
sugar and start blending blending up so
I use the same blending start mixing
away you really need to beat the crap
out of this like you really have to
at the perfect consistency sit there and
mix it and mix it and mix it it's still
quite not ready here you still have to
sit there and stir until you get that
perfect consistency stir stir stir until
it looks like a creamy delicious like
paste but not too thick and not too
runny it looks kind of whipped it looks
a little bit foamy so this is the
perfect consistency right here after
likes sitting there and stirring for
what feels like an eternity and then
she's just gonna pour a little bit more
into that and blend it why do I keep
saying blend and stir everything
together and then she's just gonna
finish pouring the rest of the coffee
and that's pretty much it this is how
you get your classic Cuban coffee with
this kind of coffee maker it's a little
bit time-consuming a little bit harder
but I feel like the coffee tastes better
like the foam just tastes so much better
I guess cuz you did it by hand but yes
that is how you do this so now my mom is
pouring it into the cup she says that a
good thing to do is shake it as you can
see she's kind of like shaking it this
helps she spilled some there but that's
okay this is how you get the most like
foam in your cup if you shake it a
little bit so she's trying her a little
coffee tastes delicious alright okay so
now I'm going to teach you how to make
it on this one so this is the coffee pot
you take that thing off that my mom just
took off and you start filling that part
up with coffee very similar to how we
did it before pack it on really tightly
and then lock it into place then you're
going to unscrew this cap up here and
you're gonna put water into this little
section right here so you grab your
little cup thing that comes with your
coffee maker and you don't want to pass
the number for my mom kind of likes to
even leave a little bit less water but
don't pass number four and fill it up
with water and then pour it right into
the coffee maker these are very
affordable like I got kind of like a
no-name brand Y Musa it's not that great
but it works so the same way as we did
it last time she's just gonna take three
spoonfuls of sugar depending on how
sweet you like your coffee this part
will vary of course so your coffee maker
has three little like um three little
nozzles it has
it has the little picture of a coffee
mug and then it has a little picture of
a steam so you obviously turn it on by
putting it on the little picture of the
coffee mug and then it's going to start
making your coffee so unlike last time
where we used like the first coffee that
came out we're not going to do that with
this we're just gonna let it you know
just brew itself you know just take out
the coffee and once it starts looking
like it's a little bit foamy at the top
you're gonna take it off and you're
going to replace it with a different cup
so that you don't like dirty you know so
that you can so the rest of the coffee
can like fall into that cup but then
you're gonna twist the knob and put it
on the steam and this is gonna make the
foam this is why I feel like making it
by hand is a little bit tastier but this
way works too and you don't hurt your
arm you're not sitting there for like a
million hours you just want to move your
little cup around and like bounce it up
and down and this creates like a foam
because of the pressure of the air that
it's putting in the you know little
cappuccino thing really cool then you're
gonna put it back onto the coffee mug
and just let the rest of it brew into a
separate little cup here and then she's
just turning it off and then she's just
applying the rest of the coffee into
this cup pouring the rest of the coffee
applying Oh anyway so she's just mixing
it up a little bit here and then that's
how you get your Cuban coffee out of
this kind of coffee maker much easier
much simpler and these things are a lot
more accessible like I'm pretty sure you
can find those pretty much anywhere so
yes that is how you get your Cuban
coffee so that completes this video I
