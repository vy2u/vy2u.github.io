weeks I've been shopping a little and I
wanted to film this haul for you before
I start using everything I've used a
couple of things but like 90% of things
I bought I haven't used yet anyway I'm
not even gonna keep talking because I
have a bunch of stuff to show you guys
well to me it's a bunch of stuff I'm
telling you right now at this little
shopping experience I am putting the
wallet on hold giving it a break because
yeah things got a little heavy and now I
didn't buy all this stuff in one day
like I said it happened the past couple
of weeks
I just haven't used the majority of it
yet by the way I did get some drugstore
stuff it's like kind of even like half
of it is drugstore half of it is
high-end you know because yeah I'm just
gonna go ahead and die that was me
typing in I embarrassed myself okay so I
got four lip products from the drugstore
that I want to show you and I do want to
say that all of these things are really
random they're just things that I have
been wanting for a long time and then I
finally just bought them not all of it
is actually not much of it as like brand
new things that just came out it's just
things that I've really been wanting
it's really random just keep that in
mind so I got this lipstick called
smoked peach and it's just a peach
lipstick but I love it because it's
matte and I love matte lipsticks like
that's my thing like my lipsticks are my
thing and I just love it's like a
beautiful peach was like a hint of pink
it's so pretty it's called smoked peach
I love it the next lipstick I got is one
of the Maybelline Vivid's lipsticks and
let me tell you how hard it was for me
to find this lipstick because I went to
CVS gone I went to the next on the base
gone I went everywhere and it was gone I
was like did they take these lipsticks
like I couldn't find it and I finally
found that at Target duh stargates
amazing and I just want to say that
these lipsticks have like the prettiest
packaging I've ever seen there's
something about this like bright neon I
don't know it's people but I got
shocking coral it's the only one I got
because it's honestly the one that I
found the most unique it's beautiful
like this lipstick is gorgeous and I
wanted it so bad because a lot of people
said that it was a dupe for Mac's party
parrot which was limited-edition and I
couldn't get my hands on that one and
they said it was a close dupe for it so
I was all over that when I heard that
and can you just look at this color how
amazing in it it's just a gate bright
peak I don't think it's coral at all I
mean no it may have a hint of coral but
it's more like a bright neon pink like
that's what I think of it two bright
neon pink it's so pretty if you're gonna
pick up any of the main building divots
I definitely recommend shocking coral
it's beautiful it doesn't smell bad I
have a thing it's lipstick smell bad
it's like it okay so I picked it up
another maybelline color whisper and I
got it in olá lilac I mentioned that I
wanted this and I finally picked it up
it's beautiful I love like lilac lips
and it is pretty sheer as you can see
like compared to the swatches of the
actual lipsticks this is more like a lip
gloss and lipstick form that's not
sticky but it has color I love the color
whispers they're amazing don't worry I
will zoom in better once and show you
this next lip product and I hate lip
gloss if you know me if you really know
me you know that I hate lip gloss I'm a
strictly lipstick girl and I like these
type of things too because they're not
sticky there's something about the
stickiness of a lip gloss I can't get
over but this is beautiful like this is
beautiful this is the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss and coral reef if I
had a dollar for every time somebody
said that
so the cross was amazing I'd probably be
rich so I have tried this out it's not
really sticky when the color is so
opaque and like literally opaque it's
not like sheer at all and it's just
beautiful it's a beautiful coral color
it's beautiful for the summer so you
know I'm glad I got it and I just want
to branch out and try to love lip gloss
so I thought this would be a good start
so this is the lip gloss in coral reef I
love it for the summer it's amazing this
is Ola lilac the maybelline color
whisper this is the Maybelline vivid
lipstick in shocking coral and this is
revlon smoked peach okay so the next
thing I got was a palette that I've been
wanting for a while and it is the Too
Faced natural at night palette this
palette is amazing it's probably my
favorite Too Faced
i shadow palette that's out there and it
looks like this I love the packaging
even though it's kind of bulky I just
love that it looks so it looks I don't
know I love it
and this is what it looks like when you
open it honestly from the second that I
saw this palette I thought it was
perfect for me because I love really
sultry looks but I like them to be more
Brown than black if I'm gonna rock a
smoky eye most likely it's gonna be a
brown one versus a black one and this is
amazing because it has all these dark
colors but they're not blacks you know
they're not like dark grays and blacks
and that's what I love about it has a
beautiful matte Brown these nice greeny
goals at the bottom this is probably my
favorite color in the palette
it's called Eclipse and it's so pretty
it's like almost a cranberry Brown I
don't know it's beautiful and I just
think really it's a genius palette
because you can wear these you can wear
these colors during the day like these
lighter colors during the day and then
really get a smoked out dark look at
night without having black in it and I
love it it's birthday and
a perfect pallet I picked up on one of
the Maybelline eye studio gel liners
because even though I love my ELF cream
liner I recently bought a new one and it
was completely dry when I opened it like
really strange
I couldn't even dip my brush in it it
was like dry I was like what so I've
heard amazing things about this one so I
picked it up and hopefully I like it too
it's just like the regular black gel
liner I picked up a foundation and I
picked up the Urban Decay Naked Skin
Foundation I ain't going the sample of
this a while ago and I liked it I ended
up picking up the Mac face and body when
instead and now I ended up breaking me
out so that was a bad decision but I
really did like it when I got the sample
of it and so I wanted to get it again
unfortunately I have to return this one
because when I went into Ulta I
specifically told the beautiful girl
that I wanted a foundation that was not
pink I told her I was like I want the
naked skin please make sure that it's
not pink at all so she gave me the 3.5
which apparently the point five shades
are pink and the point Oh shades are
yellow and then I got home and put it on
and I look like a tomato face like my
face was freakin pink and I don't like
pink tone foundations because I have so
much redness on my skin that every time
I put on a pink foundation I look extra
red and I look dirty it's just the
strangest thing I hate pink foundations
I go for yellow foundations every time
so she was like this isn't pain this
one's listen this isn't pink get it
really pink so I have to go return it
but besides that I think this is a
really good foundation and I really
wanted it because it doesn't have SPF in
it which all my foundations have SPF and
I
without SPF specifically for like
special occasions and photos and stuff
like that I didn't get it necessarily
for the summer obviously but I just I'd
been wanting it for a while so I got it
and my friend Gabby was like harassing
me for about three weeks like get it you
love it just get it go get it go get it
if you're watching I love you I picked
up two nail polishes well one of them is
nail polish and one of them is a topcoat
but yeah I picked up this nail polish
called breezy blue by a Sally Hansen and
I had first seen this on YouTube I
forgot her name no I didn't forget her
name it's just hard to say it melt and
PHS Melissa I don't know I saw that she
had this in like her Friday favorites
video and I was like that color is
beautiful I need to go get it and I
think that it's new because I hadn't
really seen it before and it's perfect I
had been looking for SES Borrowed and
blue for so long and I cannot find it
anywhere and I saw that this is similar
it's like a beautiful baby blue and it's
next really quick because I love baby
blue nail polishes and that's extremely
cheap so yeah NYC matte me crazy
mattifying topcoat I wanted ESI's matte
about you but it's like $1 at CVS and
this one was like too so I want to see
if it's just as good as that one because
if I can get something for cheaper I
totally would the next thing I got still
burns in my soul but it kind of hurts
because it's so expensive but I finally
gave in and I got the Beauty Blender I
still can't believe that this little
crap is $20 like this tiny little sponge
is $20 can you see the color on this
it's like come it's neon I love the
color but anyway I mean it does expand
once you run it under water and you like
squish it out squish the water out it
does expands like twice its size I
haven't used it yet because I don't want
to dirty it I know that that's
ridiculous but I just I know that it
gets kind of like beat up and stained
pretty quickly but I got it because
everyone says that this
on your foundation flawlessly this is
the best thing ever
and not one person has anything bad to
say about the Beautyblender aside from
its price
not one person says anything bad about
it not one so I mean if everyone loves
it there has to be a reason why and the
majority of the people said that the
dupes aren't nearly as good like the
other sponge that they sell at Ulta or
the Sonia Kashuk one they all say that
it doesn't even compare so I just went
ahead and got like the real deal to see
how well it works okay so I wanted to
pick up a toner because believe it or
not I've never used a toner on my face
ever in the history of my life and I
know that toners are crucial for skin
care like in your skincare routine it's
really important that you have a toner
but I was just so afraid of toners
because I have dry skin so I picked up
this one this is the formula ten point
nine point six so totally clean everyday
cleanser sensitive formula I picked it
up because it was the sensitive formula
they saw this brand at Ulta it's like
the strangest name formula ten point
0.61 that's a weird name
it's alcohol free which is amazing since
alcohol is terrible for dry skin and
yeah I saw that I had a lot of good
reviews hopefully it kind of improves my
skin because apparently you need a toner
guys getting a toner this is a
no-brainer
I picked up a backup not a backup
because I already threw mine away the
Clinique lash doubling mascara it was
time to get anyone so I did this is my
holy grail mascara you watch my videos
you would know that because I don't shut
up about it I just picked up on another
one I also got one of these elf custom
compact things which I picked them up
because they're a dollar
first of all literally a dollar and
they're a little calm their little quads
where you figure eye shadows in I
already put two Mac ones in there this
is cork okay this is cork and this is
copper plate and I picked it up because
they fit Mac eyeshadows
and it's dollars so it's kind of
convenient I have the Mac palette it's
just convenient to just stick for
eyeshadows in the compacts okay the next
thing I'm going to show you is probably
the thing I love most I have every
single thing that I bought it's
something that I've wanted since I first
laid my eyes on it so excited that I
finally got it okay contain yourself but
I picked up the Stila and the light
palette and honestly I'm a pallet girl
like really if you show me like six
beautiful eyeshadows on their own I'm
like oh that's nice but if you throw
them in a palette together I'm like wow
that's beautiful I need to have that
it's it's a weird thing but this palette
is beyond beautiful beyond beautiful the
packaging is really nice it's skinny and
so I mean it's pretty sleek and oh okay
so it comes with a huge mirror and these
fantastic colors but that's not all it
comes with steel as like one of Sheila's
famous the smudge sticks that you know
apparently are really popular this is
the first smudge thing I own and I love
the fact that it's waterproof so it's
amazing for your waterline
and it's the most beautiful chocolate
color let me little getting a little
swatch this is a really sloppy swatch
but it's a beautiful chocolatey color
like literally you don't even have to
press hard just glides on to your hand
this is amazing it's in the color damsel
so that's beautiful
and then these eyeshadows are amazing it
comes with one two three four four matte
shadows and the rest are shimmery which
is nice to have that many match titles
you don't really see that a lot in
palettes and to be honest the reason I
bought this palette is because I had
wanted the eyeshadow and kitten which is
right here for the longest time it is
seal --is most famous eyeshadow it's
like an award-winning eyeshadow and for
good reason oh my god that I shadow is
amazing but I figured when I steal aside
shadows is like eight
dollars I think I know I could be wrong
but it's like $18 and then I saw this
and then the Sun went away it sent one
away again oh and then I saw this
palette and I saw that I have 10 I
shadows and they're all freaking
beautiful and it came with their little
smudge stick and it was $39 decided to
go and get the palette instead I'm so
happy that I did next thing I got is so
old and I'm pretty sure everyone has it
and it is the Tresemme heat tamer spray
you know the detainer spray that
everybody has because everybody talks
about and everybody says it's the best
heat protectant ever but the reason I
picked it up is even though I really
love my red can smooth down heat glide
that I love because it has like
macadamia oil in it and it makes my hair
very shiny I feel like it's not
distributed throughout my entire hair
like evenly I feel like some parts you
have protected by the heat and some
parts don't and this is like a very I
don't know if you can see that it's a
very fine mist and I feel like it coats
your hair evenly and it smells amazing
I'm sure you guys know because I'm sure
you probably own it anyway I picked up a
couple of the Real Techniques brushes I
think Real Techniques brushes are
amazing and I picked up the core
collection now I'm a little upset but I
can't get these brushes individually
like if I wanted just one of these
brushes I couldn't buy it I would have
to buy them set that's kind of like the
downside but they're so cheap this core
collection is I want to say $18 I would
pay $18 for one brush because I think
that Real Techniques brushes are
high-quality and really really good I
mean I guess I got this because I really
really really wanted the buffing brush
this one right here I really wanted the
buffing brush I've heard really good
things about it and I really wanted the
contour brush this one is like the
concealer brush which also works as a
lip brush so I'll be getting use out of
that one
this is the only one that's like mmm I
don't use typical foundation brushes to
put on my foundation so I don't know
what I would possibly use this for but
all I know it is a really nice little
collection and it comes with like a
travel case that's really nice so and
then I picked up the blush brush blush
brush
I didn't pick it out for blush cuz I
feel like it's a little bit too large to
apply your drop your blush it's like a
little too big but I got it for bronzer
because I feel like this would be like a
really nice bronzing brush and this is
only eight dollars I will say that if
you are on a budget and you want really
nice makeup brushes check out Real
Techniques they sell them at Ulta and
they also sell them online at warmer
online IOLTA online target online I
think even Target but they're amazing
brushes really affordable okay and then
lastly I went to probably my guilty
pleasure store and that's Mac know it is
high-end I feel like it's a lot cheaper
than NARS to face benefit its high-end
but it's cheaper than that so it's kind
of in the middle and you know it's it's
a great store so I picked up a couple of
things the first thing I got is mac's
fix+ I have this tiny little baby that I
use all the time but I'm running low on
it I've got a sample cuz I didn't know
him that this was not a sample but the
smaller version so travel size version I
didn't really know how business was
gonna be and let me tell you my skin
cannot live without this anymore
this is probably the best thing and Mac
self I know that that seems crazy but
this thing is amazing
it says my back it's a skin refresher
slash finishing mist a soothing mist
that refreshes the skin
finishing makeup and it is right I like
to put this on before I put on my makeup
I like to put this on after I put on my
makeup this does set your makeup it's
not gonna set it as long at as long as
them Urban Decay's all nighter spray
it's not gonna really set it like that
but it does set your makeup and it's
perfect because you're like oh crap I
went a little bit too overboard on
powder you thought you spray this on
your face and like your natural skin
comes back you don't have that nasty
cakey powdery look this takes that away
I also picked up a pigment and I was
actually dreading buying this because on
the makeup geek website she sells Mac
pigments like samples of them for like
$4 and honestly you're not going to go
through an entire pigment it's
ridiculously large and you're not gonna
go through it but every single time I
went to buy this pigment on her website
it was sold out and it is the color tan
I mean it was sold out for a good reason
because I think this pigment is
absolutely beautiful but I'm pretty sure
it's been sold out for about six years
because I've tried to get it for so long
and it's always sold out so I was like
you know what I want it so bad I'm gonna
go buy the entire friggin thing so let
me just give you a little swatch I gave
you a little bit of a large swatch II
didn't realize that much came out sorry
guys
as you can see I went a little overboard
with the swatch I just kind of stamped
the top on my hand and kind of spread it
out and it turned into a hot mess but
this is the most beautiful pigment I
have ever seen in my entire life it's
perfect for summer oh my god this
pigment is beautiful
so basically you're not going to go
through
payment of this in your lifetime which I
mean I guess it's good because you do it
is kind of expensive but it'll last
forever the next thing I got for Mac I
have also been wanting for a long time
and it is their Pro Longwear concealer
I've heard amazing things about
concealer and it's good for under your
eyes because it has like a
non-decreasing technology or something
like that like it just doesn't settle
into your fine lines and it does
increase from what I've heard and I use
this one under my eyes all the time this
is the maybelline instant age rewind
dark circle eraser but it gets into my
little fine lines and increases like
crazy I like using this during the day
it's very little but what I want to and
I want something more dramatic like at
night and stuff or when I really do my
makeup I don't like the fact that it
pieces so I picked this one up to see if
it lives up to his hype I got the shade
NW 15 because I wanted something really
light for underneath the eyes cuz I just
having I like having a lighter concealer
for under your eyes because it just
brightens up your face and I didn't get
NC 15 which I would normally get and see
if I was getting a foundation or like a
concealer for pimples and stuff I would
get NC but I got MW because Rhonda meets
the eyes I love like a pink toned
concealer because it just brightens your
face and I feel like yellow tone
concealers for underneath the eyes make
you look sick or at least they make me
look sick I don't like yellow tones
underneath the eyes on me so that's why
I got nw15 because it's pink toned
and it just brightens your face more the
last two things I got at Mac are also
the last two things in this haul I'm so
sorry that this video is so long if
you're still watching thank you oh my
god I'm sorry but anyway there are two
lipsticks because I wouldn't be Kathleen
if I didn't go at least buy a lipstick
I'm Matt I'm Mac but the first one is
the one I'm wearing right now actually
and it's called Violetta and I've used
this quite a lot since I got it this
does look really scary in the tube as
you
cos I gave it's purple but it's like a
crazy intense purple but when you swatch
it and when you put it on your lips
it's not as purple as it is in the tooth
it does come off more fuchsia pink so it
is a lot more wearable than it looks
like in the tube because in the tube it
can look a little scary so definitely
try it on in the MAC store because you
might like it doesn't look scary in the
tube but you might like it on your lips
and the next one I got is velvet teddy I
haven't used this one at all yet as you
can see it's like brand spanking new I
got it because my friend Stephanie was
talking about it and talking about it
and talking about it how it was her new
favorite lipstick and then I needed to
get it then I would absolutely love it
and it's matte which already wins me
over because I love matte lipsticks like
I said and this is what it looks like
let me zoom in it is such a beautiful
color because it's a very browny nude
but it does have some pink to it and
when I try not at the store I fall in
love with it because okay I have very
pigmented lip store like a dark pink
very pigmented and this lipstick is like
my lips feel better you know like that
lipstick that you want like looks very
natural on you but it still looks like
you're wearing lipstick this is the
lipstick for me I love it it looks
beautiful on this isn't the best summer
shade I say but I try to run this store
and I was like oh I have to have it so
so I got it okay guys that's it I'm so
sorry that this video was so long like
literally I've been sitting here filming
for a long time so I'm a little nervous
as to how long this video is going to be
again I apologize thank you if you saw
the whole thing
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe I would really appreciate that
and I'll see you my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
