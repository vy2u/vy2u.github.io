posted a picture on Instagram asking you
guys if you wanted to see all the makeup
I bought recently and a bunch of you
guys said yes I do have drugstore and
high-end to share with you guys I know
in a recent haul I said that my next one
would be drugstore but then I did an elf
haul so technically that was drugstore
but today I do have drugstore to share
with you guys and some high-end as well
because Mom I can't help herself
but in my drugstore defense I do have
more drugstore products than high-end
products and I didn't buy this all at
one time
ok just putting that out there this is
just stuff that I've bought in a course
of a month and I've actually only used a
handful of these products most of it
haven't even used at all ok I know this
video is going to be long so let's go ok
so I'm gonna start off with the
drugstore stuff and I'm going to start
off with the drugstore lip products I
bought because you guys know lip
products are my favorite and apparently
I can't get enough I picked up three of
the brand new maybelline creamy matte
lipsticks I had no idea these were even
out cuz I've only seen a couple of
people mention these on YouTube recently
but I picked up three of them I wanted
all ten of them I really did I think
they're all so incredibly beautiful but
I have bought these last minute and I
had already spent way too much money so
I picked up this one right here it is
called nude embrace it is the lightest
one but on me it's just a little bit
Brown it does look a little bit darker
on me it's definitely a brown nude if
your are extremely fair I don't know if
you would like this but I think that it
would match a lot of different skin
tones so that one's nude embrace I
picked up lust for blush and it was kind
of like smashed when I opened it but I
fixed it up because it's beautiful and
it was the last one on display so so
pretty this is like a really pretty
dusty rosy mauve color and then the
other one I picked up is divine wine
this one's my favorite one it is the
deepest berry color or like deep red so
incredibly beautiful
the
perfect lipstick in the fall and what I
love is that these are matte finishes
and I love deeper Reds like this with a
matte finish because it's not going to
bleed or it's not going to go anywhere
this one is so pretty I definitely see
it as a staple for me and so far I have
more on all of these and I love the
finish I love that they are really
really creamy they're not like a drying
matte or anything they feel kind of like
a satin finish love these nothing like
black coffee finally found that the
Jennifer Lopez nude at CVS I have been
looking everywhere for this
L'Oreal collection Prive lipstick and
specifically in Jennifer's nude not so
much for the color but because you guys
know I'm obsessed with Jenny from the
block love her so much
can I be her please but the color is
actually really really beautiful it's
very subtle on the lips like you do have
to build it up a little bit but it's
that perfect blushing beige nude color
so so pretty to just throw it in your
purse
definitely recommend it but I hate the
scent I absolutely hate the scent of
L'Oreal lipsticks I I hate it I hate it
I could deal with Maybelline the
Maybelline ones or whatever but I cannot
I can't
you're lucky I love you cuz I don't like
how you smell and then this is not new
at all but I picked up the Revlon
lipstick Super Lustrous lipstick involve
a violet because I've been looking for
really dark vampy glossy purple like
this for a while now and I think it's
going to be unreal in the fall time I
think it's just going to be so beautiful
in the fall in winter I love deep matte
B Purple's specifically in the fall time
and I wish L'Oreal would take some
pointers from Revlon because Revlon
lipsticks do not smell at all like they
have no scent to these Super Lustrous
lipsticks and I just wished L'Oreal come
on get some pointers please and then the
last of the products I got from the
drugstore were more NYX soft matte lip
creams I picked these up at Ulta
seriously these are probably the best
drugstore lip products I've ever come
Krauss I love them so much this is what
they look like for some reason I'm
having a hard time holding these this is
what they look like I got more oh I got
I got I got this one in the shade Cairo
it is a more like pale nudie color but I
really really love it then I got this
one which is probably like my fave my
old Tom fav soft matte lip cream minutes
in the shade Athens is such a pretty
like apricot nude so beautiful I love it
and then I picked up this one in
Transylvania because again it's a deep
vampy purple that I think it would be
perfect in the fall and the formula on
these are incredible and they smell like
cake oh my okay keeping on with NYX I
got these two glitter liners these have
been out for like ever
by the way this stuff is like super
random only a few of them are new to me
but anyway I picked up two of their
liquid crystal liners I got it in
crystal silk and crystal silver this is
just a gold color and this is a silver
color I picked these up mainly to do
like really fun holiday looks around
Christmas time in New Year's Eve so I
thought that these would be really cool
like liners to have so while I was still
at Ulta I picked up a couple of things
from essence I actually don't own
anything from essence I don't think I
picked up there
I heart stage eyeshadow base I've heard
mixed reviews on this some people say
it's good some people say it's crap I
don't know I got it because it has like
that really yellow color to it so I want
to use it as a base for like warmer
looks so let me know down below if you
use this and what your thoughts on this
because I mean I've heard mixed reviews
I hope it's good and then I was looking
at their eyeshadows and I picked up this
essence 3d eyeshadow in the shade Sahara
milk cream and it's actually really
really pretty I was super impressed with
the pigmentation of these I've heard
that essence eyeshadows are good but
this highlight right here like this
champagne color is so pigmented and like
not splotchy at all and not glittery
like it's a perfect Sheen you know I
like machines and then I saw this and I
thought that this was so great and so
affordable this was like five dollars
and it's their essence all about nude
eyeshadow palette
it comes with six eyeshadows and really
really nice eye shadows too especially
these two at the end right here this is
like a deep plum or cranberry color and
this is like a topi color so pretty I
really really like this and maybe I'll
do a tutorial using this because it is
so affordable and yeah I also got this
at Ulta and I don't think this is a
drugstore brand but it definitely was a
drugstore price I only paid seven
dollars for this and I've heard really
good things it's the Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe herbs and
rosewater it's basically like a rose
water spray and I love the smell of it
even though I don't like the smell of
roses or anything rose scented but I
really like the smell of this although
I'm a little afraid because the I bought
something from Target once and it was
their boots botanics like organic toner
and it smelled exactly like this and it
broke me out really bad so I hope this
isn't bring me out okay then I went to
Target and I picked up a couple of
things there I picked up these two
products from ELF
they are the long lasting lustrous
eyeshadows I got mine in toast and in
festivity I wanted to buy this because
I've heard mrs. Lola Lynn talk about
this one a bunch of times in her videos
and it looks so pretty I've heard good
things about these little little gems
here and I want to do like a best of elf
video like all the products I really
love from elf and hopefully I could
include these because I've heard pretty
good things
is just a really pretty like dusty gold
color really really nice self ready love
it love colors like this and then I
picked up festivity to use a more
dramatic nighttime like cranberry purple
smokey eye kind of days and it is really
pretty has like a bunch of little
glitters and it texture of these are
really cool they're like very very mu C
I picked up another NYC liquid eyeliner
because is my favorite one I don't think
any brand in the history of the world
competes with this and this is like two
dollars
it's amazing the blackest most blackest
matte liquid liner in history of the
world the only thing that compares to
this in my opinion is the bombs
Schwing liquid liner but this is a lot
cheaper and then I picked this up this
is an eyeliner I don't know you guys
thinking you're gonna cheat on
Maybelline semester drama and I might I
might I've heard really good things
about this this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes waterproof um Kohl eyeliner
in black and it's just oh it's just a
black eyeliner but I've heard it's
really good and that it lasts all day on
the waterline so I might put this to the
test will this replace my Maybelline
master drama who knows
oh this is really really black Wow hmm
hmm okay so I picked up a new foundation
and I've heard so many people talking
about it recently even though it's a
really old foundation and I just had to
have it because it just screamed
Kathleen every time somebody was
describing it and it is the Neutrogena
Healthy Skin liquid makeup they say this
is a dupe for the NARS sheer glow and I
tried the NARS sheer glow foundation
absolutely loved it but it broke me out
really bad so but so far so good
I use this the other day it fell
absolutely in love with it this is the
foundation I'm wearing on my face right
now it has the most natural finish ever
it's just it's so natural like really
really natural you look healthy
like I understand healthy skin then the
last thing I got at the drugstore is
this L'Oreal boosted high lift creation
spray this is instant lift and fullness
back combing finisher is basically like
backcomb in a bottle the reason I got
this I don't know who I saw using this
in a video it could have been Nicole
Guerrero I'm not exactly sure but the
reason I got this is because sometimes I
do want that extra volume in my hair
when it's straight because when my hair
is like curly it does have pretty good
volume but when it's straight it's just
like really flat and so when I curl it
with a curling wand I oh I have another
thing to show you that I bought but
anyway and I don't know about you but
every time I see someone tazed their
hair like I cry inside the thought of me
teasing my hair like literally will make
me throw up and no offense to those of
you who tease your hair but my hair is
so fine like I will brush my hair sneeze
and then I have a rat's nest just like
just from sneezing my hair gets knotted
so easily so even the thought of teasing
my hair makes me sick but I've always
wanted that volume that teasing gives
you so I hope this gives me some volume
I've heard good things I wanted to show
you guys this it's in my drawer about
this the other day this is the Remington
oh god what is the name of this tea
studio I don't know it's the Remington
tea studio something-something it's the
one with the pink barrel but they have
different sizes this is the one-inch one
and a half inch it goes from one and a
half inches to one inch
it goes from fat to skinny so when
you're like doing your curls like it
gets a little bit thinner towards the
bottom but it's still a pretty fat wand
it's one and a half inches and I love it
so much I got this off Amazon for $20
and it's really really good you can
control the temperature and it gives you
it gives you a really good hold for a
really long time and it's ceramic which
is really good for your hair I know that
the other kind of barrel the one that's
really shiny makes your hair really
shiny but ceramic won't damage your hair
as much that's why people always
recommend you to curl your extensions
with ceramic wands because they won't
damage your hair as much I always
recommend a ceramic flat iron or one
because I think they are the best
personally that's just me so I just
wanted to share this with you guys
because it was so incredibly cheap and
so good
who needs new me not me who needs new me
when you got Remington not me me who
who's new me I don't know so I got this
seriously guys I think new me is a
little bit of a ripoff I don't like to
like bash companies at all but I bought
this is oh my god this video is gonna be
so long I bought this new me wand like a
year ago
it's a crimper and a curling wand it's
like a two in one where it crimps your
hair and then when you close it you lock
it it's a curling wand as well which is
why I wanted to buy it because I was
like oh sure I'll spend $100 on a
curling wand because it comes with two
comes with a crimper and a curling one
yeah the outside doesn't work that's why
everybody on YouTube never spoke about
the outside they only showed you the
crimper because when you go to curl your
hair it gives you absolutely no curl
whatsoever so I was super disappointed
in this okay so moving on to the things
that I got that were high-end by the way
guys I cannot haul any more for you okay
I can't it's my last haul for a few
months
alright give me a break this is the it's
so big volumizing mascara from Elizabeth
Mott I had to order this online because
you could only get this online I
actually tried this mascara for the
first time in my Ipsy bag and felt
completely in love one of the best
mascaras I've ever used in my entire
life why are you holding two of them
I'll tell you why
there's actually a coupon code that FC
is giving out or like gave out a few
months ago that still works if you use
the code hypsi tint at checkout you get
two for the price of one so this is a
$20 mascara but if you use it seed
tint you get one free so it makes them
ten each which is a pretty good deal
that's pretty much like drugstore price
so I got two of them because I got one
free and I'm and I got it off the
Elizabeth Mott website Elizabeth
Montcalm yeah pretty sure
oh right - then I got three things at
Mac because Mac is right next to Sephora
at my mom a lipliner that everybody and
they mama loves so I wanted to pick it
up it is night loss from Mac and I'm
sure you guys have heard of it a
thousand million times but it is that
really pretty perfect fall shade it's
super super dark really dark like berry
with a little bit of hint of purple in
there I feel so nice this looks great
underneath purple lipsticks underneath
red lipsticks so so pretty so I wanted
it so I bought it and I picked up this
guy it is the Mac Pro Longwear concealer
I used to use this all the time I have
nw15 in my makeup collection but I
haven't used it recently because it is
like white pretty much it's pretty much
white the color white and it was perfect
for me when I was super super pale in
the wintertime but when I got a little
bit of color and now that I self tan
more frequently it's just a little bit
too white for me so I picked up nw20
it's just a little bit darker so it's
perfect for when I'm self-tanning and
then I picked up this this is a little
funny story this is from their new a
novel romance collection it is their
electric cool eyes shadow I got mine in
pure flash this is really similar to
color pop eyeshadows in the sense of
even the same packaging kind of really
similar to the Stila magnificent metals
that it feels like a cream kind of and
it's so funny because I swatch this at
the store absolutely loved it when I got
home I was like you know what it really
isn't that amazing it really really
isn't so I wanted to return it I tell
Danny I'm like hey I'm gonna go return
this he's like no I'm like what do you
mean he's like no keep it he really
thought that the only reason why I
wanted to return it is because I had
like buyer's remorse and like because I
had spent the money on it and he was
like no keep it keep it it's okay just
keep it it's fine it's fine I was like
no no I really want to return it because
I really don't see myself using it that
much he's like you thought it was so
beautiful at the store and I was like I
know but I really don't see myself using
it that much Simon returns like no keep
it keep it it's fine I'm like no dude
dude listen the reason why I want to
return it is because I don't see myself
wearing it not because
the money honestly I swear he's like I
don't believe you and then rips my
receipt and I was like but I was so yeah
that happened and then I just walked
into the room and was a little bit
confused for a few hours so is a really
pretty like champagne color so yeah I
have to use it out have no other choice
I picked up the Porefessional from
benefit but I picked up the little one
that's ten dollars because I want to see
what all the fuss is about because out
of every primer in the history of the
world like all the primers people use on
YouTube they always say that this one is
the best one like all the poor vanishing
primers are nothing nothing compared to
this those other primers are peasants I
picked up this it cosmetics CC plus
radiance ombre bronzer and honestly I
love it cosmetics it's one of my
all-time favorite brands Hite like
high-end
I love Too Faced and deaths they're like
probably my favorite brands this more
probably I just love what they represent
like I love what they're about I love
everything about this brand and it says
color correcting plus anti-aging
waterproof bronzing veil with hydrolyzed
coltan peptides and drops of light
technology like really really it
cosmetics here just have all my money
here have it all I love them so this is
what the bronzer looks like this the
packaging it is pretty big and this is
what it looks like on the inside you get
a matte bronzer because this bronzer is
completely mapped right here on the
bottom and then in the middle you get
more of like a shimmery Sunkist bronzer
still really pretty and then you get
your highlight at the top I did contour
with this product today I used it in my
cheekbones and on my forehead not stuff
hit my brush right here in the highlight
section and I highlighted with this
probably highlight it a little bit too
much not gonna lie but when I get a new
highlight I'm like I picked up the
Anastasia Beverly
I'm resi pellet I'm reezy I'm resi I
don't know how to say this woman's name
such a great makeup artist I follow her
on Instagram oh my god I can't get this
out so pretty these colors are right up
my alley and it has like pops of color
right here and then these are super
wearable everyday shades the
pigmentation on this palette is really
really incredible these two are a little
bit chalky but you can still get really
good pigmentation out of them I love
this and I recommend it because it is
$29 okay so I picked up another mascara
because I recently cleared out all the
mascara I had that was open and dry and
gunky so I got rid of like half my
mascaras and now only like one or two of
them are open so I wanted to stock up on
my favorite ones I got the Too Faced
better than sex mascara and this is
twice the sex I hate the name of this
mascara seriously I find its mode
appropriate it's like uncomfortable like
what are you putting on your eyes better
than sex okay calm down they could have
they could have named it like better
than cheesecake nothing is better than
she's cake what am I saying
so I got this one because it came with a
three travel size better than sex
mascara so for this so for the price of
one you got an extra little sample size
so I was like heck yeah and I picked
mine up at Sephora by the way so yeah I
love this mascara it's probably one of
the best volumizing mascaras in the
world oh I'm gonna go in two lip
products I picked up I have never tried
any of these before and I was and I'm so
impressed this is the Stila stay all day
liquid lipstick I got mine in fiery I
love this I know that the famous one is
beso like their liquid lipstick in
vessel and it's kind of like Max Ruby
woo like that really bright beautiful
firetruck red and I'm sure it is
absolutely gorgeous but I wanted
something a little bit deeper for the
fall time but still like a nice regular
red lip no to me and I really really
love it I think it's so pretty and I'm
so impressed with this stuff it
literally goes on your lips and stays on
your lips all day they're not kidding
stay
no yeah they're serious two more lip
products that I'm over the moon about
I'm so excited about them I love them so
so much they're both from bite Beauty
and bite Beauty is a great this video is
so long I'm thinking about the length of
this video and it's so long this is my
beauty is amazing because they are made
with natural food grade ingredients you
could pretty much eat your lipstick and
you would be fine
which makes so much sense doesn't it
because lipstick is on your lips all day
and eventually you eat it like without
realizing you eat your lipstick and I'm
sure there's like weird chemicals
lipstick so it's amazing that these are
made with natural food grade ingredients
so I really really love that a little
bit there about I love it and bite
Beauty came out with these matte creme
lip crayons and they came out with them
for fall 2014 I believe I think I saw
that on temp Thalia yeah fall 2014 so I
picked up these two shades and I love
them I got the more neutral shades like
the two lightest ones even though
they're not light and I got this one in
leche leche leche
I don't know legit I'm gonna say legit
it's a really really pretty dusty rose
color so beautiful so perfect for
everyday and these wear all day they
last on your lips all day there are not
a drying matte formula they're actually
really really creamy amazing I bite
Beauty seriously you have the best lip
products ever the scent is amazing like
amazing and they're just great I love
this color and then I picked up this one
in glaze pretty sure that's how you say
it there's like little posture fees on
the ease confuse me and this one is a
more true mauve color like the other one
is a little bit like a dusty rose a
little bit more pink in there but this
one is like a true Mavi color looks
beautiful on the lips
she who shall not be named apparently
nobody wants to say her name anymore it
reminds me of that like lip craze so
beautiful though like so beautiful okay
we're coming to the end and we have one
more product to share with you guys
Danny actually bought this for me today
and it's the Too Faced
milk chocolate Soleil bronzer now let me
tell you a little story a love story
it's fast don't go anywhere don't leave
I got the milk chocolate one because I
do have the chocolate Soleil bronzer and
like a little compact one like a travel
one and I love it I really do but
everytime I go to apply it to my cheeks
I'm like oh god I have like a giant
stamp of brown on my cheek because it is
so pigmented and dark it's like pretty
dark that it can just get too pigmented
too quickly even though this formula is
so easy to blend like I could use
chocolate Soleil perfectly fine and yeah
it's pretty pigmented at first but it
blends out really really easily so I
love it and when I run out of that
little compact one I will buy the full
size but still it is very very pigmented
and always every time I put my brush in
it put it on my cheeks I get a stamp of
brown all the time so I decided to pick
up the Too Faced milk chocolate bronzer
so that I can go ham like a crazy woman
like this and put it on my cheeks and I
have a problem it is lighter I recommend
this for light to light medium skin
tones and yes it is light but it's
buildable and I love the undertone in
this so and come on I got to be honest I
bought this mainly for the scent just
kidding not mainly but like you know
like 96% okay guys so that was
everything that I bought like in the
course of four weeks I hope this video
isn't too long even though I know it is
because I already had to switch out my
memory card so thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
you're good wait my son I bought this
because well I just spit all over myself
beautiful Wally oh oh okay I mean okay
and then the last thing I'm just kidding
no it's not lasting
I picked up two of their necks I picked
up two of their liquid crystal crystal
okay
sip some coffee and relax God is the
name you know his name
excuse me I need to know the name of
these Oh say oh say okay what okay
keeping on with NYX I got sweaty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
