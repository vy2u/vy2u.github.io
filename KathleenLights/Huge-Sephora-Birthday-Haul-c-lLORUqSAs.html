ha and apparently people really really
know I love Sephora because I got a ton
of Sephora gift cards for my bday which
remember there was last month and I
finally put them to good use I went in
stores a couple of times and then I did
buy a few things online but mainly the
bad things I bought in person and I say
bad things because I was like you know
what I have a gift card a few gift cards
and I'm just gonna buy some luxury
makeup I never would have purchased
otherwise so if you don't like high-end
makeup then this ha is definitely not
for you and actually I'm kind of
disappointed with a lot of these I want
to say a lot of these with a few of
these things I have tried out a couple
of these things already and some of
these products I'm not impressed with
I'm actually going to be returning some
of these and they're expensive products
so I'm gonna get started because this is
gonna be a very long video because I
bought so much so much I mean look at
this box ah okay I'm not gonna go in any
order I'm just gonna start pulling
things out let's start with what I'm
wearing on my face right now
this is the Dior skin err flash
foundation I've had my eye on this for a
while but it's like a $60 foundation and
I never wanted to spend that much so
when you got a gift card it's like
everything has the words yo little
written on it so I'm wearing this
foundation right now and I'm on the
fence about it I have to say that it's
not my favorite so far it I don't know
what do you guys think it's a foundation
I'm wearing can you tell the difference
does it look regular does it look basic
I think so people really really love
this I just find it kind of a hassle to
use like I was spraying it on my brush
and then applying it that way because if
I would have sprayed it on my face I
would have just created a mess and even
just spraying it on my brush kind of
created a mess there was like foundation
just like everywhere I gotta give
another shot but I don't think it's
worth the money right now
right now I gotta test it out more and
then I got two more Dior products this
is the Dior glow Maximizer my friend
Laura is always talking about this this
is a light boosting primer and when I
swatch this in into for like when i
swatched it i fell in love with the way
that it looked on my skin this is
the bottle label tool it has such a
pretty luminous finish and it just looks
so radiant you can't really tell in this
lighting but like at Sephora I could
have sworn that it was like the most
beautiful thing I had ever seen so the
next product and 100% returning I don't
like this at all this is the Dior Addict
lip glow liner it says contour color
Reviver and filler it's kind of like
their lip glow in this pink color but
it's a lip liner but I feel like it does
absolutely nothing I'm just not a fan of
this at all
like I just feel like it does nothing
for me I don't like it so it does going
back so I bought a lot of foundations on
this little trip about a few foundations
so the other one I bought is the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer I haven't wanted to try
this for so long and I've gotten so many
requests to try this foundation like you
have no idea so many of you guys want to
know my thoughts on this I got mine in
the shade breeze but this is not my
color it's a little bit too pink for me
but this is my fault like I'm so dumb I
wanted it so bad that I got it even
though I knew it wasn't my color my
color is linen but the linen is sold out
online and linen is sold out in the
sephora closest to my house so I got
briefs and I don't know why I would buy
a foundation that's not my color I tried
it on and I loved the finish so I'm just
gonna wait for linen to come back in
stock and maybe like return this one but
I loved the finish I don't know I think
that I I really liked it even though it
wasn't my color I just really loved the
finish so so far so good I can't wait
for my color to come back in the dark
okay so I got the Marc Jacobs fine liner
it's just a black eyeliner and the only
reason I bought this is cuz it reminded
me so much of the new Maybelline super
skinny liner it's pretty much in the
same packaging only the packaging is a
different color and it looks just like
it even clicks like it like the
Maybelline one clicks like that and I
have to say I think the main wing one is
a lot better I'm wearing this on my
waterline today and I feel like the
Maybelline one stays in my waterline so
much more
I bought this thinking that maybe the
Maybelline one would be a dupe for it
but
mainly one is there see it's not always
about price tags and brands it's about
quality guys quality I bought so many
nail polishes can you explain to me why
I did I just really did the main reason
I started looking at nail polishes is
because I wanted to buy the Patrick
Starr nail polishes that he came out
with or like he collaborated with
formula X I feel like I can't talk today
it's weird and I am so excited for
Patrick I love them so much I bought all
three even if they were colors I didn't
like I was going to buy them but these
colors are actually stunning and
beautiful it's like two creams and then
like a glittery one they're so beautiful
and Patrick has like a one-of-a-kind
soul I love Patrick so much so anything
Patrick does Kathleen well bye and
support and as a Patrick so much so
while I was looking at formula X
polishes I saw these and I was like I
want those those look amazing look at
these look at these aren't these amazing
these are like my favorite colors to
wear like the greens and the blues
they're all glittery like they all have
like a metallic finish
I got prismatic it's like a teal green
Eva amazing moon glow which is like a
purple blue and then I got this lime
green color and it's called florescent
love these colors I got this caviar
anti-aging miracle multiplying volume is
and this is from the brand alterna I
really do like a lot of the alternate
products and I saw that this was new so
I decided to pick it up because my hair
doesn't really have much volume and you
are supposed to spray throughout clean
towel dried hair prior to blow-drying
and let's see if this gives mama some
volume ACCA's moment needs next thing I
got is this bad boy I thought this
wasn't coming up to like March but it
was letting me add it to my cart this is
the SA edit by Estee Lauder and it is
her beam team hydrate and glow product
it says apply solo or with makeup over
under or mixed right in flip the cap to
highlight with targeted beam cream so
when you open it I'm going to kind of
use it as
primer or mixed in with my foundation
when you open it it just squeeze this
out and it has like a shimmery finish
but nothing too crazy it feels just like
a moisturizer with a little bit of a
sheen to it so maybe this would be good
for my dry skin and then you flip the
cap here and then you use this part as
like a cream highlighter but it's too
golden for me like I cannot use this as
a highlight on my face it's too dark I
also got another illuminating primer
this is the Sephora beauty amplifier I
feel like I've got in like three
illuminating primers already and I have
like 20 of them why do I continue I
don't know it's like an obsession I
guess this is afterglow primer and
Luminizer and the mobile disease
I love Sephora collection like they have
a lot of great things in the Sephora
brand for a lot more affordable than
most brands sold at Sephora so this
comes out and like a champagne color
whoo oh yeah that looks really pretty so
it's just really hard to see in the
lights but that feels really nice and
moisturizing I'm excited okay let's talk
about a product that I'm kind of like
not impressed I might return this this
is the ciate bamboo bronzer long-wear a
bronzing powder I got this because I had
really good reviews online but it's not
good for my skin tone I don't think so
the packaging is really really cute and
this is what it looks like
it's a little bit too warm for my skin
tone it's the bronzer I'm wearing and it
comes off a little bit too orange I like
warm bronzers but it I don't know I
don't like the undertone in this and it
looked a little bit patchy when I was
trying to blend it this is the origins
mask you miser skin optimizing mask
primer I was so excited to see this I've
never seen any product like this before
you're supposed to like you're supposed
to spray this on your entire face before
you go in with your face masks and it's
supposedly gonna help your skin like
adhere to the face mask does that make
sense like it's gonna help like suck in
the face mask and you're gonna get like
the most out of your face mask according
to this so we shall see another product
from the Sephora collection I got the
Sephora color
full blush in the shade can't stop
smiling
I haven't even open this I think these
are pretty new I'm not exactly sure but
this is the color right here it's such a
pretty peach and I've heard pretty good
things about oh it's so pretty I've
heard really good things about these
blushes and they're pretty inexpensive
first Sephora prices
okay I got two face masks I know I'm
excessive I got these two and these are
both new or no this one's new I don't
know if this is new I'm not sure this is
from the brand herbivore this is their
Brighton pineapple enzyme and gemstone
instant glow mask I got it because it
said infant glow mask it comes with like
a little spatula thing this is supposed
to make your skin look nice and hydrated
and glowy so you know mama is all for
that and then I got this one this is the
boscia charcoal PO this is a choco poke
poke puedan the charcoal poor pudding
it's a charcoal mask so it's really
going to help clear out your pores
charcoal is really good for that and it
has like this really cool black and
white color to it it has also a little
spatula and will look another foundation
okay so I got another product from
Sephora another foundation this is the
Sephora ten hour where perfection
foundation I saw Nicole Guerrero used
this in a video and I thought that her
skin looked really pretty so I decided
to pick it up I got mine in the shade
light ecru and I can't wait to try it
because I think it was only like twenty
dollars and most freaking foundations at
Sephora are like 35 to like 80 so I'm
excited and it comes in a really pretty
frosted bottle and a pump so a plus on
the packaging Sephora a product I'm
returning this is the Kevyn Aucoin
the sensual skin enhancer I got this
because Manny loves it
I think and nikkietutorials and this is
kind of like an all-in-one product you
can kind of use it as a foundation but
it's a very concentrated product many
uses it as a concealer so that's what I
used it today I use it today for the
first time and my skin is just too dry
for this I know he has oily skin maybe
that's why he
really likes it but this emphasized the
dryness under my eyes like there's no
tomorrow oh my god so dry under there
and it did not work for me start
returning it which I'm okay with because
this dang thing was 50 deaths and then
I'm going to go ahead and talk about
another product I did not like this is
the Kosh endo aqua foundation
illuminizer illuminator I have the one
that's in the shade 0-1 and I really
really like it it's a nice champagne
it's perfect to mix in with your
foundations but this is way too pink I
bought it online and it's called sheer
pink and I thought it was gonna be that
like a really pretty sheer pink but this
is like strawberry milk is hoping look
at this pink I don't know if you can
tell but it's too pink for my liking I
want it to be a little bit more pearly
pink they have a white one as well but
I'm just gonna stick to the one I have
the I'm just I'm going to return this
because I just like it this is the
Shiseido full lash serum this really
intrigued me and it had pretty good
reviews so I decided to pick it up it is
a lash serum
it makes your lashes look beautifully
longer denser and fuller it says to
apply morning and night after skincare
work into your lash line without rubbing
apply first two lashes and then to
browse clean applicator after each use
by pressing lightly with a tissue before
returning to the tube I'm really excited
to see if this product is going to make
my eyelashes grow or my eyebrows grow
make them look fuller and thicker if you
guys have tried this lash serum by
Shiseido please let me know if you like
it please please please let me know I am
excited to see if it works
this is the Beauty Blender but it's
their new color and it is a nude Beauty
Blender which at first I was like
perfect perfect a nude Beauty Blender
you'll never know when it's dirty and
then after I bought it I'm like oh wait
a minute I'm new to Beauty Blender
you'll never know when it's dirty how am
I supposed to know what I'm going to
clean it but I do think that you can
totally tell the difference between like
the foundation and then
this is kind of like a poopy nude like a
very dull poopy nudists oh you could
totally see your foundation in it but it
won't look as dirty so I think that's
pretty cool I won't say though I don't
know why this feels different
then my pink Beauty Blender and my crazy
let me know do you think I'm crazy
because this feels different I'm almost
positive it's different okay and then
one last thing and before we go into lip
products of course this is the giorgio
armani maistro' glow nourishing fusion
makeup bi-phase elixir it has SPF 30
this is pretty much like a tinted
sunscreen
and I've always been skeptical of
Georgia Romani because I really didn't
like the luminous silk foundation it
made me look like a greasy hot dog so I
was like hesitant to try other things
but I thought that was pretty silly and
this had really great reviews and then
after i swatched this on the back of my
hand i was like oh my god this is
beautiful
so it has very very very sheer coverage
it's pretty much just a tinted sunscreen
but it has a beautiful glow at least to
the back of my hand it did like it just
looked so beautiful in the back of my
hand I'm very excited to try this it's
not really a foundation but yes it has
like a little dropper I'm excited I got
mine in the shade 4 and then the rest of
the products are elite products buxom
came out with new full-on lip creams and
you guys know these are my favorite
favorite lip glosses so I got peach
daiquiri it's such a stunning peachy
color is very sheer but I think this
would look so pretty on like warm nude
lipsticks and then I got another lip
gloss that was more expensive and I'm
not even that impressed it's a Burberry
product if you guys saw my disappointing
products video I'm just not a fan of
Burberry makeup and I don't like the
smell of this okay so this is the
Burberry kisses gloss wet shine
moisturizing gloss and I got mine in the
shade nude beige it's a stunning color
and beautiful packaging like I could
kind of taste it when I put it on my
lips and it's like a chemically taste
which I'm not a fan of but my lips did
look really pretty I had a beautiful
shine to them it's such a pretty color
I'm gonna play with it a little bit more
it's definitely not a fail I just don't
like the scent that's the only thing I
don't like
and then the rest of the lip products
are all from bite Beauty because bite
Beauty has my heart they came out with
new lipsticks these are the amuse-bouche
I cannot read that and I got two shades
they sent me like six colors and I loved
them so much that I picked up two shades
that I didn't have they have a ton of
new colors
I got souffle say really really pretty
like pale bubblegum pink I don't
typically go for these colors but I
thought to step out of my comfort zone
because I really like the formula and
then I got this one in the shade
meringue and it's a really pretty like
pinky nude color really good formula I
can't believe they're discontinuing or
they'd already discontinued their other
what is it what is it oh I have it in my
purse their other formula because
retsina
from bite is one of my favorite
lipsticks it's called red Cena and I
think they discontinued it which is
gonna make me very angry and then I got
three of their new matte creme lip
crayons these are so amazing I love
these I have a ton of colors I got this
color in the shade Sucre which I'm not
exactly sure if that's even how you say
it it has an apostrophe on the e
but I'm gonna call it Sucre and to be
honest the only reason why I bought that
is because that is a character on Prison
Break and one of my favorite characters
on Prison Break his name is Sucre it's a
really pretty
Coralie pinky color really really nice
and then I got this one in pasty pasty
this one is incredible guys okay you
need to rush out to your local Sephora
and buy this this color is incredible
look how beautiful this color is it's
such a pretty like everyday purpley mob
it is stunning I love it this one is in
the shade Blanc which at first I was
like what the heck but I thought that
this would be really cool to mix in with
other lip colors it's just a white one
so I thought it would be really great to
like light in other colors if it's too
dark I want to like make it a little bit
milkier I thought a white one would be
really cool and since the formula is
really good I thought I would give it a
shot so that was everything I got at
Sephora recently a lot of new products
that I stumbled upon on Sephora and some
of them were definitely misses for me a
few of these products are being returned
to Sephora so I hope you guys
enjoy this video let me know what you
recently picked up at Sephora and if you
loved it or not thank you guys so much
