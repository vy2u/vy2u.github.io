have hot cheetos on my teeth I just ate
an entire bag of hot cheetos and my
lipstick hasn't gone anywhere so today's
video is a really really really exciting
video my heart is pounding because today
is the day where it introduced something
very important to me to you guys you
guys are a watcher of my channel you
will know that I have been so
ridiculously obsessed with the ofra long
lasting liquid lipsticks since they came
out pretty much I have been using them
in so many tutorials and so many of my
videos I cannot get enough of the Oprah
long lasting liquid lipsticks and the
craziest thing has happened
Oprah actually asked me to collab with
them and create my own personal liquid
lipstick and to be quite honest with you
guys when this whole liquid lipstick
craze started happening I became
obsessed fast very very fast it was all
I was purchasing I was barely using
lipstick all I was using was liquid
lipstick and I kept thinking to myself
wow I would really really love to collab
with a brand to create my own liquid
lipstick it's just something that ever
since they came out I wanted to do so
when they asked me to collab with them I
didn't even hesitate because they are
one of the best liquid lipstick formulas
I have ever used in my entire life and
they got started right away it actually
happened very very fast I've been
keeping this very hush-hush for a while
now but it happened so fast I'm more
than happy with the color that I created
and to be honest with you guys
I knew the color I wanted almost right
away and it is the color I am wearing on
my lips right now and this is what it
looks like it's so crazy I'm holding it
in my hands okay this is the liquid
lipstick that I created with Oprah and
if you have any of these you know that
all of them are like named after cities
or places like Venice Pasadena Las Vegas
all that stuff so I did want to keep on
with the theme and I named
Miami fever now the reason why I named
it Miami fever is because I wanted a
name that really correlated to my life
and I am from Miami born and raised in
Miami so I thought it would just be cute
to add the name Miami and I thought
Miami fever because when I look at this
color I think of a hot spicy fever I
don't know that's just the vibe I get
from this if I could describe this color
this is a very burnt dark terracotta
color and it has a mixture of red brown
and orange all mixed together it's a
terra cotta basically I have been
wearing this lipstick for it's four
o'clock and I've been wearing it since
10:00 yes I'm counting with my fingers
I'm wearing this liquid lipstick for six
hours I have not read touched and I just
ate a whole bag of hot cheetos and I
know you're thinking by the way side
note hey Cassie and I thought you were
over Hot Cheetos and you weren't gonna
eat them anymore yeah I thought the
exact same thing so this is the color I
came out with and I don't know if it's
going to be everybody's cup of tea maybe
it's not but it is me in a liquid
lipstick I knew right away that this is
the kind of color I wanted to create if
I'm going to be completely honest with
you I have over like 300 lipsticks and I
don't have anything this color I have
orange e reds and I have orange and I
have brown Reds but I don't have a
mixture of all of them where it's like a
nice burnt terracotta color it reminds
me of a pumpkin spice latte or like a
pumpkin garden I love love love love
love this color not just because I
created it but it's an amazing color and
I think it would look good on so many
different skin tones
honestly this screams fall in a tube I
think it's going to be perfect for fall
I'm not going to stop wearing this so
fall appropriate it looks so pretty with
just mascara it looks so pretty with
like a really dark brown smokey eye it's
gorgeous I also think this would be a
beautiful summer color because I just
think of like the heat like the summer
nights and the summer heat and I don't
know I'm the orange in it is also very
summer appropriate too so it's a color
that shouldn't limit you you can wear
this whenever you want I know that the
ofra long lasting
when lipsticks are pricey they're like
$20 but but you guys can use my coupon
code to purchase Miami fever and you
save 40% off they were very generous to
give me 40% off for you guys I love
talking about expensive makeup and I
love talking about drugstore makeup you
guys know I love to incorporate both on
my channel and I know that not everybody
has money to just drop 20 bucks on a
liquid lipstick or anything like that so
the fact that they gave me a coupon code
for 40% off is really amazing I will
link it down below but it's cathleen 40
it'll all be listed down below and you
can use that code to purchase this
liquid lipstick or any of their liquid
lipsticks or anything on their website
but yes if you buy this and use my code
it comes up to around $12 and I think I
think they're worth the $20 to be honest
but the formula is so amazing I'm not
just saying that because I collab with
them I besides the color I think the
color is stunning besides the color the
formula is fantastic so hydrating they
don't dry out my lips at all I love
these I really hope that you guys check
out Miami fever they're also now in this
packaging it's like a newer packaging
it's just a little bit shorter but I
don't want you guys to get scared they
have the exact same amount of product
because they're just a little bit fatter
and shorter and the reason why they do
that is or the reason why they did that
is because the thing can go all the way
down to the bottom so you can pick up
products perfectly like you'll get every
bit of product in this packaging as
opposed to the long skinny one or
whatever so yes says kathleenlights
Miami fever and I really really I really
am proud of myself I hope you guys are
proud of me too because I would not be
where I am without you guys I don't want
to get emotional I get a motion on every
video when I talk about you guys but you
guys have been with me every step of the
way I have really nice subscribers and I
couldn't recognize all the people who
comment on my videos over and over again
I recognized you guys and the people who
tweet me and support me so much and you
don't have to do that the fact that you
guys are so supportive makes it worth it
makes it so worth it as long as you guys
want me to be making
I will continue to make them because I
feel like I have so many friends so I'm
so grateful and I think I think each and
every one of you who sits down and takes
ten minutes of your day to watch my
videos sometimes 20 minutes of your day
thank you thank you thank you from the
bottom of my heart thank you you
watching this you are the reason I am
holding this in this hand holding this
in my hand yes thank you and even if
people don't like the color it's okay it
was just an experience to just collab
with Oprah so I really do hope that you

favorite one that they have come up with

product is very very limited 100%
