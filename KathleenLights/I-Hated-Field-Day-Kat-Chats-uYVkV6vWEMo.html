episode of cat chat and you can tell
because I'm here on maquette Jeff couch
these are my pants
covered in makeup swatches and dog hair
few things I need to talk about before I
get started with this video one today's
video was not supposed to be a cat chest
and it was also not supposed to be this
kind of ketchup guys always wonder what
that noises like I was saying it wasn't
supposed to be a cat chest it was
supposed to be a different kind of video
beauty video and the cat chats that I
was supposed to film this week was about
whether abang operations peterpan that I
told you guys I was going to sell my cat
test all about it but I'm actually
reading a book about it and I want to
finish the book before I do a cat chat
so that cat test will come later sooner
than later but later today we're just
going to talk about something else
maybe something that you guys will find
absolutely not interesting at all but I
realized I haven't told you guys about
this which is really weird because I was
a very very very dramatic kid and this
situation kind of traumatized me for a
while I'm also not wearing any mascara
isn't that weird
I barely have makeup on and I know it
sounds so stupid in so many videos when
people are like oh my god excuse my face
I don't have any makeup on or excuse my
hair it's super puffy I do that all the
time but you would be surprised at how
many people come in like you look weird
put some makeup on so sometimes you feel
like you have to apologize for not
wearing makeup which is kind of stupid
if you think about it because why does
it matter if I'm wearing makeup when I'm
just shouldn't your telling you guys a
story I also didn't brush my hair so
let's do this so I'm actually going to
be telling you a couple of stories in
this video the main one being the first
one I'm going to tell you about but I
thought it wasn't cool enough or
interesting enough to just put in one
video so there's a couple other stories
I want to tell you that are really
really insignificant but I want to tell
you anyway grab some coffee grab a snack
I just want to chill and hang out with
you guys today we're just going to talk
okay now I'm ready so I don't know if it
happens in all schools but in my school
and pretty much every school in Miami we
had something in elementary school
called field day it's a pretty fun day
for the average kid all of the kids in
the school get together and they have
like this incredible amazing a massive
field day you play tug of war which will
get you doing mean soccer flag football
I think dodgeball all those fun
activities here's a little facts about
me I hated field
I also really really hated PE not only
am I not aesthetic not even a little bit
but I was also a really really shy kid
like I did not like to be the center of
attention I didn't like anybody looking
at me telling me or reprimanding me
every time the teacher told me something
even if it wasn't that bad I would start
crying in class it was it was a disaster
I would have hated to be my parents
anything that embarrassed me made me cry
like it was horrible for me field day
was always that event that I was
dreading that he never ever ever looked
forward to because I hated having to do
sports things in front of other kids the
most awkward most embarrassing things
what happened to me at field day and you
would think you're in elementary school
how bad could it be
so there was this kid in my class I'm
gonna call him Jimmy and he was a really
heavy boy like he was a pretty hefty
little kid and I'm not trying to say to
be mean at all sure you're watching this
video like what the hell does that have
to do with field day I'm not saying that
to be mean he just really was really
like he was a hefty little kid and he
was actually one of my best friends I
loved him wait lunch together we play
all the time he was cool so in my school
you played a field day with your grades
so if you're in third grade all the
third graders would get together and do
field day I don't remember what grade I
was in during this field day because I
feel like field they happen to every
single year and I don't remember how old
I was during this time but it was
elementary school so I was tiny
I'm currently 5-1 my license says I'm
five too but I'm 5-1 I've always been
very short and on i-93 school I was the
shortest girl in my class so every year
before field day we would kind of like
practice in during PE the teachers will
kind of set everything up and show you
what you were gonna do on field day
because not every kid played every
single sports they would kind of make
the best kids to do certain things
because you know the teachers didn't
want to lose for example if my future
wanted the class to win and soccer like
they wouldn't pick me to play soccer
that would be stupid and that's usually
how it went and honestly it just made me
feel so much better because I never got
picked for any sport but there were
certain games that were mandatory you
had to play no matter what even if you
stuck you touch to play one of those is
tug-of-war because honestly it doesn't
take much skill to just pull a rope now
I was pretty depressed to this we had
practice weeks before field day our
teacher set us up in a way that the
shortest kid was in the very front of
the tub or line and then the
this kid was all the way at the back
they're the ones that are the strongest
and they could fool the hardest so of
course me being Kathleen the teacher
obviously wanted me to be at the front
of the line because I am the shortest
and I'm also pleased my teacher is
gathering all the kids the other
teachers gather now the kids they give
us this giant rope or ready we're like
standing there we are ready and I
probably should mention that our teacher
really drilled us on how to pull the
rope she kind of gave us like a little
strategy we were supposed to hold the
rope and scream we were supposed to pull
back as we screamed
but we were supposed to stop really hard
it's really hard to show you because I'm
sitting on the couch we were supposed to
step up and pull and stop down kind of
like this ah but standing up and more of
like a stomping thing you get me so for
some crazy reason that I don't
understand why I decided when my teacher
wasn't looking to just run to the back
of the line and if I'm going to be
honest I think it was because the kid
right in front of me like a me opposite
side in the other class I pretty sure
was the kid that I had like a huge crush
on I've always had a thing for short
guys not like shorter than me but you
know what like if you tall you're like
all the way up there what am i I can't I
get it earlier I'm really shy and I'm
really weird so I can't think of any
other reason that I would run to the
back of the line unless it was because I
was embarrassed or there was somebody
there something was going down so I
rented the back of mine and Jimmy was
actually the last person in line I don't
remember what I told him obviously was
elementary school but it was probably
something like I don't want me in the
front of line it's freaking me out
blah blah so I just went and stood right
behind him minding my teacher was
walking away she didn't see this and
then by the time that she sat down under
this tent I'm going to think she could
see us very well I don't know she just
did not notice I was in the back of the
line like hello you don't see a tiny
person just run to the back of the line
that can't be good you might want to put
her back to where she was supposed to go
but no so they blow a whistle and all of
a sudden we start screaming we start
screaming and we start pulling this rope
like it was like it's nobody's business
and at first the other team starts 20
they were just doing a little bit better
than us and we could not let that happen
and by we I mean then because I hear so
the teacher is like screaming from under
the pen like let's go halt you could do
it it stopped or some harder pull higher
so everyone starts freaking out and they
really bring out their bruster like uhh
get really really aggressive in the
midst of all this somehow I fall on the
floor I can't even tell you how or why
but I fell on the floor want to see a
triple rock something less about it and
all of a sudden Jimmy Jimmy gives his
most aggressive most powerful grunt and
stops right on my face like directly
like he's like if the planets were
aligned in a way that if he could put
his perfect footprint on the side of my
face it happened he stomped on my face
so hard that I blacked out for a second
and honestly all I remember thinking was
that Jimmy had must have had like little
tiny rocks stuck from the rubbery cracks
underneath his shoes you know your
sneakers how they have those ridges I
remember feeling like I thought Jimmy
must have had like ten and tiny little
rocks stuck in those ridges because when
he came down on my face I kind of felt
like a bunch of tiny little knives
scrape the side of my face along with a
lot of dirt he stepped on my face when
we were trying to take back the title
all right
we were aggressive and I we I need them
so of course when the foot comes down on
my face I start screaming I didn't sir
crying
oddly enough didn't me just turns around
and gives me like a sari and continues
to pull his rope so I run towards my
teacher my dude
tug-of-war never stopped nobody even
bleep I ran to my teacher and I saw a
situation show that what were you doing
in the back of the line we freaked out
and then she takes me to like the
doctor's like the nurse in school they
checked my face to put Niels four and
they've been a bunch of stuff they gave
me a bag of ice and they made me wait in
the principal's office for my mom and I
just remember sitting there with a bag
of lights like it was this ice and then
when all the kids heard about this they
could not stop making fun of me
Jimmy completely apologized by the way
totally not Jimmy's fault he really just
wanted to win tug of war guys this is
not Jimmy's fault this is my fault the
kids made so much fun of me for that
there was a kid in my class I believe
his name was Joey I think that was his
real name Joey was calling me face foot
face by the way Joey could come up with
something better than foot face then of
course my mom being really dramatic I
wonder where I go from she shone about
the principal's office freaking out like
oh my god what happened to your face
what's going on whatever I thought how
the store
I mean it's not a big deal meant to take
me home and I'm kind of trying to
explain the story to my dad because he's
overreacting seeing like my face a
little bit scratched by this time by the
time I got home it really was only like
four little scratches it wasn't that a
little bruised but it wasn't love it and
I remember I got freaking out like what
the hell did a little boy punch you in
the face
no like oh my god definitely looks okay
boy didn't punch me in the face he just
stepped on me calm down but yeah that's
pretty much it and yeah the story might
have not been interesting or funny or
cool but I think there's a lesson we all
could learn from this story and that is
to try and stay in line at all times and
they know in this case it was literally
that I shouldn't have gotten on the line
but I think it was the universe trying
to teach me at a young age to just not
get out of line figure 2 and I don't
know ever since that day I've just
always stayed in mine maybe my life
would have gone an entirely different
direction had Jimmy not stepped on my
face Wow okay so this next story I want
to tell you really quick is something
that didn't happen to me it happened to
one of my friends but for some reason
I'm going to tell you because it was
also a field day story and as I was
telling you the Jimmy story it reminded
me of this and I had completely
forgotten about it so I had a friend in
elementary school and there were twin
boys and even though I'm in her school I
kind of feel we were saying his name
because the embarrassing thing happened
to him so I'm gonna call him Bobby I
wasn't really friends with Bobby's
brother I was more friends with Bobby
you know there's always a twin you like
more Mary King Tamara you know and I
think me and Bobby were in line to play
what's that game where you go up it's
kind of like baseball you use a big ball
and use your feet that called kick ball
right that's what it's called this kick
ball but actually is a very common sport
now that I think about it that one was
actually one of the things that was
mandatory everybody had to play kick
ball and I remember Bobby kind me like I
have to pee so that I have to pee so
that I just have to pee so I was like
okay Bobby go tell the teacher I don't
know Tony and I remember Bobby going up
to the teacher asking her and her like
shaking your head and then he comes back
to the line and she just didn't let him
go to the bathroom which now that I
think about it is really really cruel I
will never understand a teacher that
does not allow a kid to go to the
bathroom I mean granted every situation
is different there are kids who go to
the bathroom like 10
general just so they won't be in class
but you just never know the situation in
asking us good eleven splendors about an
especially Bobby he was doing like the
potty dance he was like I got a PE I got
a ping so I turn around and I start
talking to my friend who's standing
right in front of me I was you're having
a conversation and all of a sudden I
hear about legal oh and I turn around
and Bobby has his leg like spread out
wide he's almost in a squat position and
he's just Pete and I don't know why that
this vision of him peeing is like
forever burns in my mind I can picture
it perfectly he was wearing a green
shirt with khaki shorts I even remember
the look on his face he was like kind of
disgusted he didn't do it on purpose he
just really couldn't hold it in anymore
and he peed everywhere like he wasn't
like oh I peed a little bit maybe I
should just runs without on them no and
I remember just staring ahead like I
stared at him while he was peeing I was
like Bobby you're gonna beating
everywhere and I think that's why I
remember it so vividly because I was a
kid who really got embarrassed really
easily so just watching him pee I felt
so bad for him I got so embarrassed for
him that I went from full-on panic mode
when I saw him peeing and I ran to my
teacher like Bobby's ping they came in
they took Tammy I guess he went to go
pee and I want to go change his clothes
I didn't know I just remember feeling so
bad for Bobby and thinking about it now
it's like that poor little boy I know
that embarrassing story had nothing to
do with me but I was kind of involved
and it was pretty embarrassing honestly
guys I just wanted to stay here and tell
you how much I hated field day I really
did and I can't tell you how many times
i have hit myself in the face with my
own cousin ball it used to swing back
around and knock me out almost every
time and i just one time during PE it
wasn't field day but it was PE and i
don't know playing soccer and I remember
the goalie I remember her name perfectly
too and they went to kick the ball into
the goal I'm not a soccer water but
every time I have seen soccer I've seen
the person just lets the ball you know
like oh this girl I kicked it back like
it tried to come in and shoot when she
kicked it back it hit me right in the
face and mind you this girl was a soccer
player okay she wasn't just like a girl
in elementary school playing soccer no
like she did soccer outside of
elementary school she was really great
soccer player like mouth hit my tooth
and all the inside of my mouth was
bleeding it was horrible I hated PE so
much okay so have a couple more
embarrassing stories to tell you guys
this
nothing to do with field day or anything
like that but I wanted to include them
in this video because it's like I said
it's not special enough to have its own
video from an Jeanine we're talking
about this story the other day Jeanine
is my cousin and we were just cracking
up on the phone I don't have a lot of
story time videos like my life is not
that interesting but I've had the most
embarrassing happen to me and these
two things happened literally one day
apart from each other so the first one
was when I was in seventh grade I
accidentally signed up for aerobics
class and I do this because I know my
mom did that she tells me she didn't but
I know my mom signed me up for aerobics
cuz I would have never done that I would
have never picked that elective I went
to a middle school where everyone shaded
the aerobics teacher she was the meanest
most aggressive aerobics instructor I
remember that was there with my friend
Emily we had that class together and she
would play the same music every time and
I still know the moves like I still know
the aerobics moves till this day we
would do the same thing every class ok
boxercise
okay and she wouldn't let anybody talk
there in her aerobics class obviously
you're in the middle of aerobics no need
to talk but I just couldn't control it
every time and milena and I would like
lay down next to each other just start
doing sit-up who would just have like
full-blown conversations and our teacher
would get so mad and every time she
would see somebody talked he would make
us do like more situps I don't know we
were laying down me and Emily Marais
necks each other the whole class was
doing situps and I remember that I
started to like go like this because my
necklace hurting while I was doing the
situps because obviously nobody really
taught me how to do them correctly and I
remember her screaming from across the
room like well Kathleen maybe your neck
hurts because you're not doing it right
and like I said earlier I don't like
anything with authority yelling at me it
just makes me uncomfortable so I was
like all nervous mother tried to do my
sit up correctly and then when she
looked away I remember I turned over to
Emmeline and I said this sentence ah I
hate our teacher she's such a bitch and
I never used words like that in middle
school but she had just embarrassed the
crap out of me if I called her a bitch
but that's not the best part the music
cut off as soon as I said she is such a
bitch so I went a little bit something
like this
cases here she's such a bitch you could
probably expect some happen next I got
in big trouble because of course she saw
us talking in the middle of steps so she
turned off the music to scream at us and
then that blurted out that was screaming
I just didn't realize it but once the
music cut off it was very loud and very
clear terrible and then the very next
day the exact same crap happen to me
again totally different situation I was
in a different place I wasn't even at
school Janine and I when we were younger
we were in like a modeling class like
our parents put us in like modeling
after school and our class was like in a
studio like in a warehouse type of thing
with this huge runway and we would
change into a bunch of different clothes
and we would do like a bunch of
different fashion shows and like all the
parents would come and see it and it was
like a whole big thing well that day
Ginny and I were like sitting on the
side of the runway with other people in
our class and we were watching everyone
go up and do like the little turns then
you know model and do the whole thing
and we always had music playing when we
would do that and the music was always
playing really really loudly like you
really couldn't have a conversation with
the person sitting right next to you and
I remember Ginny was pretty close to me
but she wasn't sitting right next to me
it's not something I could have
whispered I don't know why I wanted to
tell her but I wanted to tell her that I
needed to fart like for some reason
something about I had to tell her I I
wanted to tell her that I had a desire
to Sarge and it went a little something
like this
to fart and just like that everyone in
my modeling class too started laughing
like I got so far and I just remember
sitting there like like honestly and
truly how how did I not learn my lesson
from literally to paint before I know
you're thinking like oh my gosh should
you ever go back to modeling after that
I don't pay for it so I had another
choice but to go God knows I didn't want
to anyways that completes this video I
just want to show you guys a few
embarrassing stories I hope this video
wasn't really stupid as I'm filming it I
feel like I don't even know how to put
this video up honestly I love to do
these catch-up videos just so we can
talk and just so you didn't get to know
me better I'm not trying to sit here and
tell you like oh my gosh I was roofied
at a bar and then I a stripper spit on
me like it's not that kind of stories
I'm not a story time channel I'm a
beauty channel but sometimes I just like
to tell you stories that have happened
to me and none of them are ever going to
be that interesting yes understand my
life was never that crazy be traumatized
by my window story time is probably as
rebel as I got
I mean sure when I was like 16 if
somebody would've told me hey you're
gonna have a YouTube channel and people
are going to depend on your stories we
need to catch up I would've had more fun
things SAN hope you guys like this video
I am sweating buckets right now I don't
know why it's so hot in my house but I
feel like my face bright red it directs
me I'm just nervous you're going to hate
