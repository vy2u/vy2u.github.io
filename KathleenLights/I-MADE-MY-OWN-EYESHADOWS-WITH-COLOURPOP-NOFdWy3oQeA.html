well it's exciting for me I just bit um
this video was supposed to go up days
ago like April 8th but I was out of town
the two videos you saw before this will
the last video you saw before this was
pre-recorded because I went to West Palm
Beach for daddy's job we had to stay
there for a couple days so I couldn't
film and I should have pre-recorded this
video but it didn't dawn on me because
I'm that dumb but I'm finally recording
it for you guys it's been highly
requested for those of you who have been
following me on Instagram and Twitter if
you don't follow me on those platforms
you should but I'm so so excited to film
this video for you guys today and it is
all about Disney oh bugs right here if
you guys don't already know if you don't
follow me on Instagram or Twitter you
probably don't know well I have
mentioned it in videos before so maybe
you do know do know but I DUP with color
pop once again and this time I created
my own four eyeshadows if you guys have
been watching my channel you know that
Lumiere by color pop was created by me I
you know created the color and the
finish and the name and everything and
it was such a blessing and I've never
felt like more proud of myself ever in
my entire life
oh my god don't start crying we're just
we just started this video relax
vehicle faith so when colour-pop reached
out to me again and said Kathleen would
you like to create your own foursome of
eyeshadows with us I was like yes
absolutely 100% so I want to thank them
for just like believing in me once again
and collabing with me once again I have
a great relationship with everyone at
colour-pop I didn't meet them when I
went to California I got to like play
with my own eye shadows because when I
created the lipstick I kind of created
it from home like behind the scenes like
all the way over here but when I went to
IMATS for LA no but when I went to LA
for IMATS
I also went to the color pop lab and I
got to touch the eyeshadows before like
see them being made tweak them a little
bit and it was just a fun experience but
I am so happy to finally be filming this
video for you anyway let's get into what
this video is about I love you guys want
to see swatches names or you just want
to know about the product so this is
what the box looks like this is
available to purchase already this was
released April 9th I will link the
website I don't know what that word was
I will link the website down below in
case you do want to purchase it you
don't have to know pretty sure but you
know whatever so this is what the box
looks like it says color pop and then it
says where the light is with my little
logo or not logo but my little youtube
symbol on the bottom that says
kathleenlights I think that the
packaging is so pretty when I was there
I told them I want this quote I want
like it to look like it has lights in
the back and they were so cool about it
they were on the computer and we were
kind of like designing it together it
was really fun I'm very proud of what
the box looks like I think it's
absolutely beautiful if you guys don't
know I my favorite or my favorite phrase
in the entire world is keep me where the
light is I actually have it tattooed on
my foot right here I find such
inspiration behind those words like to
me it means like just keep me where the
light is you know keep me where the
positivity is I always tell you guys you
know not to have your heart in the
darkness always keep yourselves in the
light and I don't know it's just a
phrase that means a lot to me it's from
John Mayer's song gravity when I first
heard that song like years and years and
years ago for some reason those words
like stuck with me
gravity is probably the John Mayer song
that means the most to me I love it and
I did ask them if this was copyright
like where the light is because you know
John Mayer sings that and stuff but no
lawyers investigated all the good stuff
it's not copyright we're good if you
guys were wondering why I named it that
that is why also my youtube name is
Kathleen lights and it just
I have ties together I like lights I
like everything about lights so once you
open the box this is what it looks like
it just says super shocked and it has my
four eyeshadows these are individual
eyeshadows it's not like a quad it is
like a foursome and then when you open
the box they like fall out like this and
then you get your four eyeshadows a lot
of people were saying that it was pricey
which I can totally understand this is
$20 for the box but they priced it that
way because each individual eyeshadow is
five dollars like if you go on their
website and you buy their eyeshadows
they're five dollars which is really
really inexpensive
those are drugstore prices for single
eyeshadows so when they put the quad
together obviously it's four eyeshadows
so it's $20 it kind of sucks that you
cannot buy them individually but that's
just how it is like that's just the set
the plot you know so I could totally
understand for some of you who don't
like certain shades and don't want to
commit to buying the whole thing I could
totally understand I mean it's okay but
that's just kind of the way that it
works so there's not really much I can
do about that so I'm going to go through
each individual shade with you and show
you swatches and all that good stuff the
first one here this one is called glow
and it is a matte finish by the way if
you guys don't know if you don't own any
color pop eyeshadows they are a creamy
consistency almost moosie not really
creams but almost like a moosie texture
kind of like a like a mousse yeah
creamy mousse so like I said this one is
in the shade glow and it is the lightest
one I wanted like a highlight shade I
wanted like kind of another highlight
shade but a matte creamy color and
honestly a lot of people don't like this
shade because it doesn't suit every
single skin tone I'm not going to lie it
just it does not I would have loved to
put a creamy color that suited every
single skin tone but obviously that's
not the case because what a like creamy
matte brow bone highlight to me is not
going to be a creamy matte Brown
highlight to somebody else with a deeper
skin tone but I had to work with color
pop in this sense because they have a
bunch of matte eyeshadows a bunch of
amazing
Matt eyeshadows and I wanted to create
one that they didn't already have so if
I went darker than this there was a
bunch of colors that they already had
that they already have in their
collection
that is darker than this does that make
sense I'm just trying to say that they
have a lot of matte shades already so I
wanted to make a different one so this
is the one that I made this one is
called glow and it's funny because it's
matte and it's not like shimmery or
glowy at all but that's why I named it
that cuz I thought it was funny but it's
only funny to me I bet I have this one
underneath my brow bone right now if you
are my skin tone I think you're really
going to like this color if you are
lighter than me I think you're gonna
like if you're a little bit darker I
think you're gonna like it if you have
really dark skin you can mix this with
the other matte shade to create you know
a color customizable to you I've used
this as an eyeshadow base before like I
put this all over my lid and then I go
on top with different eyeshadows and it
works well too so that is glue this next
one is also matte I have two mats and
then two more like fun ones and this one
is called Cornelius and the reason why I
named it this if you don't know my dog I
have three dogs but my oldest dog my
prized possession the love of my life is
Cornelius he's six years old seven
almost he actually turns seven in June
and he's the love of my life he is my
best friend literally talking about him
gets me sad like about to cry because I
feel like he's getting old already so I
know a lot of people were like why did
you pick a dog that's kind of mean but
corniness is my favorite and I can't
help but he is my lifelong companion I
can't help but he's my favorite and
actually creating this eye shadow the
second I saw it in person I was like oh
my god that looks like Cornelius is here
and I was sitting at the colour-pop lab
and I was like would it be weird if I
named it Cornelius and it was like no
that's really cute do it so I went ahead
and named it Cornelius and I freaking
love this color it's what I have in my
crease right now I actually filmed this
tutorial right before I sat down to film
this video so that should be up tomorrow
I'm going to try to upload that video
tomorrow I have this all over
prease I have it like really low
underneath my lash line I think it's
absolutely beautiful and what I love
about this is that it's buildable so it
can go really lightly like i swatched it
pretty lightly you guys can see that's
just like you know one swipe but it's
really buildable it can look really dark
like if you put layer after layer after
layer it can build up to a really nice
deep color so I think that this will be
suitable for many different skin tones I
wanted something warm like they reminded
me of like a frothy latte from Starbucks
yep okay and then the last two colors
are like really really fun this is my
most favorite eyeshadow out of all of
them seriously like my freakin favorite
and it is called kathleenlights yeah I
really love this shade because it
literally describes me perfectly this is
my ideal eyeshadow and to be quite
honest um let me tell you a little story
about this eyeshadow my first ever Mac
eye shadow or one of my first ever matte
eyeshadows was amber lights and I wore
to to death to this day it's still my
favorite eyeshadow of all time and I
have like a kajillion eyeshadows it's a
it's my favorite well now this one is my
favorite and I told them I told them the
story I was like you know amber lights
means so much to me it's I think it's
the most beautiful eyeshadow I have ever
seen so they made their own version of
it it's not the exact same but it's
better it's more intense it's more
metallic it's absolutely freakin
beautiful and this is what I have on my
entire lid right now I have nothing else
on my lid just this and Cornelius in the
crease and I love it so much it's so
metallic and so intense you don't need
to wet this because it's already like
that creamy consistency it's free it's
beautiful
I'm not just saying that because it has
my name on it and the last I shadow is
called blaze and it is this one right
here and I love it almost as much as
kathleenlights honestly I think it's
cooler than cafe lights Oh having lights
is
a pearlized finish and this one is a
metallic finish though this one has like
a pearly Sheen this one has tons of
glitter all throughout it this one
reminds me a lot of Max texture
eyeshadow which is actually one of my
favorite Mac eyeshadows in the entire
world but you really have to build that
up you have to put like fix+ and really
build it up but once you do it's
freaking amazing but this one what this
one reminds me a lot of it and it's
intense and beautiful it's really really
glittery in a lot of photos online it
was kind of looking green unlike some
people's swatches but it's not green
it's a deep chocolatey like I mean I
guess it could kind of look green okay
no it's it's a chocolaty bronze with a
ton of glitter it's so fun it's so
beautiful my friend Gabby one of my
dearest friends in the entire world like
I love Gabby to death she did a makeup
tutorial using this on her entire lid
I'm gonna link it down below so you guys
can go watch it and subscribe to her
channel so yeah I love this color I
think a lot of you guys will like it too
I have it on my lower lash line and just
the glitter is so cool I love the
freakin glitter in this eyeshadow so
yeah those were the swatches of the
where the light is for some from
colour-pop and kathleenlights I really
hope you guys liked it I completely
understand if you cannot buy it I will
leave it down below like I said if you
do want to purchase it and I hope you
love it there are some people who hate
war my shadows and who prefer cool tones
and would be like repulsed by the sight
of this box
and that's okay but you know when I sat
down and I decided to create these
eyeshadows or like the the colors I
wanted I was like okay I need to do like
two cool tones and two warm tones
because that's what people are gonna
like and this and this and this and I
was just so worked up on like what does
everybody get a like I want something
that people are not going to hate and I
was like you know what no do what comes
from your heart and that's what I did I
created a foursome of colors that I
would wear on a daily basis and they're
really warm and bronzy but that's just
who I am again I am so blessed it was so
fun to create these eye shadow
