a pillow right here so if you see like
little fuzzies
that's my pillow hey guys how have you
guys been it's been it's it's been
obviously today is not a traditional
beauty video I just wanted to sit down
and talk to you guys I feel like I've
been doing videos like this a lot more
than I should but it is what it is I
know everybody spoken to you guys about
what's been going on and I told you guys
that me was gonna be really intense and
I was gonna be traveling a lot and that
maybe they were gonna be more random
rambles videos and then my uploads were
gonna be off but it's been worse my
uploads have been crazy off I even
promised an extra video last week and I
wasn't able to get it up and I haven't
filmed it's a pre-recorded video that I
filmed like three weeks ago and I got in
my own head because it's a makeup swirl
it's more like a try to get ready with
me but it's an all peach look it's a
similar look that I've done like a
million times on my channel and after
doing that like full blue look I was
like do I want to do another full look
it's just peach it's just a different
color but it's like the same thing but I
really liked the face products I used in
that video I liked how my skin looked
I've been doing my skin like that
recently whenever I've been putting on
makeup so even though the eyes are basic
is that something you guys would be
interested in because I would be more
than happy to post that video for you
guys I just wanted to come and sit down
and tell you guys because I know a lot
of you guys don't follow me on Twitter
or on Instagram Twitter is usually where
I update you guys whether I'm posting or
not we wanted to apologize and I'm not
apologizing for not uploading or taking
time for myself
I'm apologizing for saying I'm gonna
upload when I'm not gonna upload and I
know that's so frustrating I did that
last week like a bunch of times I was
really pulling your leg there for a few
days he was just a rough week last week
it was it really was really really wolf
week so I had intentions of posting but
things just kept coming up and it was
like impossible to film or post last
week so I'm so sorry about that I didn't
mean to say I was gonna do something and
then not do it I should have just been
upfront and honest with you guys since
the very beginning like hey listen I'm
having a lot of anxiety I've been
dealing with a lot of stomach pains a
lot of stomach issues and I'm just I'm
not sure if I'm gonna be posting while
I'm home I always feel so guilty when I
don't post
I always feel myself coming up with just
excuses and I end up causing myself even
more stress and anxiety because I'm
worried about what everyone's gonna say
it's ridiculous I feel like I've gotten
to a point where it's like listen if
your subscribers care about you and they
like you they're gonna wait till you're
ready to post and you know they'll be
okay with it I'm leaving in a couple
days and I'm gone for a lot of days more
than I'm used to more than I like being
away from Porter I don't know if it's
all of that plus just stomach pains I've
been dealing with recently all that
mixed together has caused so much
anxiety these past couple weeks that I
find it impossible to film I'll notice
I'll try to film a video and I'm taking
like massive deep breaths in between my
sentences but I just look really anxious
in my videos and they're not they're not
videos I want to post I don't want to
look like that I don't want to feel like
that I want to be good
feel happy record a video and then post
it because I feel like energy is totally
transmitted I don't want to bum you out
just cuz I'm bummed out I want to lift
your mood up just in case you are bummed
out you know what I mean so I like
laughing and talking about makeup and
just getting away from it but when I
feel helpless or like shitty with a lot
of anxiety or just like these gas pains
and these issues that have been coming
through with my stomach that I can't
seem to find an answer to when it's all
of that it's really really hard to be
good and I don't want to film unless I
feel good you know and I just hope you
guys can understand that I know a lot of
you can I feel like those of you who
don't understand that are very normal
and you guys are so lucky and I wish I
was more like you that's kind of like
how I feel about Danny like dying
doesn't really get anxiety because he's
never experienced it and that's amazing
I hope he never experiences it and he
kind of helps me talk myself out of it
but when you're in a funk you're in a
funk I know traveling has a lot to do
with it in airplanes and just my fear of
everything my constant fears cause so
much chaos in my mind in my body it's
crazy I don't even know how to explain
it and I know that it's because I have
so much to do in the next upcoming weeks
that it's causing a lot of chaos in my
mind when I'm home and it's and it sucks
because I should be pre-recording can
you talk frustrated thank you guys for
letting me vent to you even though I'm
not talking to anybody I feel like I am
I feel like you guys throwing the others
this camera subconsciously I feel like
you're helping me feel better I don't
know just let me feel that way okay so
yeah basically I'm just here to tell you
guys that I don't I don't know if I'm
gonna post the rest of me I know I want
to be back June first focused and ready
so I probably won't be posting for the
rest of this month unless you want to
see that basic peach chaddy get ready
with me let me know in the comments but
I'm almost likely won't be posting for
the rest of this month I want to come
back June first
I know I say it all the time and don't
murder me but leave your requests down
below in this video I'm gonna take my
notebook and I mean I already have a
bunch of requested things on my notebook
but new things are always coming out
there's always constant new stuff so
leave me requests in this video of what
you want to see from me in the future
putting out content three times a week
9:00 a.m. like non-stop you know I want
to get back on my game for sure and I
know in order to do that I need to focus
on my job and the reason why I'm so
anxious and I'm traveling a lot like I
need to focus on the rest of the month
and on my health and I don't want to bum
you guys out I know people always say
like wow once somebody gets so big on
YouTube they just stop posting they
don't care about the subscribers anymore
to create their own brands and they no
longer post that's not true that's not
true for me listen I promise you I have
no problems for your recording I love
pre recording I love posting even when
I'm gone
it's just been I just it's been I've
been going through some stuff you know
and I'm so grateful for the job I have
because I can't I know that there's jobs
out there where you just can't call and
tell your boss like hey having a panic
attack I can't come in buy and hang up
the phone like there you can't do that
I'm very very grateful for you guys and
for the job I have so I hope you can
just understand even though I know most
of you do but I just wanted to make this
video to let you guys know I don't want
to keep your hopes up I don't want you
waiting on a video that's not gonna come
so speck me back June 1st incite you to
