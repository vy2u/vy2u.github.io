usually put up about three videos a week
when I try my best to do that and I was
like I need to put up a video today what
to do what to do so I decided to do the
I heart summertime I love tag videos and
I like filming tag videos and I hope you
guys like watching tag videos a couple
people have asked me to do a video about
my hair like the hair products I use and
how I keep it so long and healthy and I
will be doing that very soon
so keep your eyes peeled for that ok so
enough with the chitchat I'm gonna go
ahead and get started with the tag ok so
I couldn't pick just one nail polish
because I feel like there's so many
different nail polishes that go wearing
in the summer the summer time it's like
where you have fun with your nail polish
and you wear all these bright colors and
stuff so I couldn't pick just one but I
picked a certain color I love wearing in
the summer and that is blue nail polish
I love wearing blue nail polish on my
nails it's probably my favorite color to
wear on my nails but the color I've been
obsessing over recently is this one by
Sally Hansen it's the extreme where nail
polishes and this one is called blew me
away it's what I have on my nails right
now and I
I feel like it's the perfect mix of like
blue and has a little bit of teal in
there so this is a close-up of the nail
polish I just wanted to zoom in so you
can see it a little bit better I love it
it's called blew me away like I already
said and it is what I've been really
really loving recently another really
beautiful one by the same line is called
breezy blue and every time I wear this
nail polish I get a lot of compliments
and everybody asks me what I'm wearing
it's very similar to ESI's Borrowed and
blue so if you don't want to waste eight
dollars on the nests and your polish
pick this up because it's like two
dollars
this is another one where I could have
picked just one because I love bright
lipsticks and I love lipstick colors in
the summer I just I love wearing hot
pinks and oranges and lot stuff but I
picked two of the ones that I think are
perfect for summer like they
spring/summer one is when the drugstore
and one is a MAC lipstick and the one
that I love from the drugstore is
Maybelline in the Vivid's collection
it's called shocking coral and I've
talked about this already a bunch of
times but it is the perfect pink it's
more pink to me than it is coral
honestly but it's a beautiful color it
kind of comes off a little bit neon and
like when you put on your lips it's like
Kapow in your face it's very bright and
the next one is Costa chic by Mac so I
don't wear this color unless it's like
spring and summer because I feel like it
represents summer perfectly like it's
that perfect summer color it is a frost
but it doesn't come out frosty on your
lips at all and this lipstick is really
unique to me like if someone was wearing
this lipstick I would know right away oh
that person is wearing Costa Sheik like
it doesn't you can really tell off the
swatch but on your lips it just it glows
on your lips it's amazing it's here here
it's really similar to this but it's
like a little bit more muted and more on
the peachy side of coral and this is
more on like the pink side of coral by
the way if you are wondering what's on
my lips right now I have max so Ishod
the dress I chose to share with you guys
isn't necessarily what I would wear like
out on the town on the summer nights but
it's what I wear every single time I go
to the pool like I literally wear this
dress every time I'm gonna go to the
pool and it's this dress right here it's
a strapless little dress like this and
it has kind of like a chevron print and
then you can tell it's kind of like a
chevron from but it has all these
different colors like pinks and greens
and like white little polka dots have it
all like messy and kind of wrinkled and
the title like about it because I
literally just throw this on over my
bikini it's definitely the dress that
has gotten most use out of all the
dresses I own this summer that's why I
decided to include it because it's my
perfect pool dress and I wear it all the
time I got it my sister gave this to me
and I don't know where she got it from
the tag says mostly most apply I don't
know I'm definitely gonna have to say
any type of like head chain or headbands
or head wraps I love how that looks I
think that that can dress up any outfit
if you have like a cool headband on and
you have like just like a regular basic
t-shirt I think it kind of dresses it up
and it looks nice I love this head chain
I award in my June June July June my
June favorites video and I get
compliments every single time I wear
this it's just like a beautiful gold
chanak for like a princess every time I
wear that and I wore this one in my
recent get ready with me video for like
a second it's just a headband I made I
have to fix it though because it had
like this disgusting it was too long I
have to like cut it and put the elastic
to make it you know like a regular
headband but I love it I made it out of
the flowers that you see back here they
kind of fell and they weren't sticking
I was like ah what am I gonna do with
these flowers so I turned it into a
headband I know aren't I creative I
instagrammed a picture of it
and I just think it looks really cute I
love flower headbands now I think Lana
Del Rey has a lot to do with that I
really love how black and white is
inside of the summer because you can
wear it just like a black and white
dress with like a bright pink lipstick
and you look really trendy or you can
wear like a black and white skirt like a
pop of color on your shirt I love it but
I really have been loving high-waisted
shorts and my favorite shorts are these
right here these are from Target tarjay
and I love them because I don't know if
anybody else has this problem but when I
brought my high-waisted shorts my butt
is like hanging out of the shorts I
cannot find high-waisted shorts that my
butt doesn't come out of that's really
weird and I think it's because most of
them are like cut kind of like up like
this so my whole cheek is like hanging
out in thin air and I can never find
high-waisted shorts that fit me nicely
but these do they cover like your little
pouch and they just they look really
cute with like a basic muscle tee I just
I love these shorts okay don't hate me
but I don't have a favorite summer
candle I'm not really one who burns a
lot of candles I have the candles behind
me but they're more for like decor I
don't really burn them I get little ones
from Target like the little three dollar
ones they're like vanilla and stuff like
that to burn those in here in my roof
but I'm more like the plug-in air wick
Glade kind of girl so I don't have a
favorite summer candle
I didn't add a body spray just because
I'm obsessed with the dark kiss body
spray from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and that is
what I love all year round I will spray
that crap in the winter I have no shame
it's amazing if you haven't smelled that
please smell that you will not regret it
but for perfume this is definitely my
summer scent and it is
JLo's Miami glow I have like a drop left
it makes me so sad but when I smell this
I just picture everyone smelling this
this is exactly how you want to smell in
this summer it's amazing and it's
actually very cheap like this is a big
bottle and it was about like $35 I want
to say compare 35 or 40 maybe even less
compared to like really expensive
perfumes out there it smells amazing I
don't like any of JLo's other perfumes
this smells nothing like it so if you
don't like those either I would still
give this one a try cause it smells
nothing like it I pulled up the notes
just so you can kind of get an idea of
what this smells like it says it starts
with lush and juicy notes of pink
grapefruit coconut water passion fruit
and blackcurrant the heart is a blend of
orange blossom sensual vanilla and musk
there's like other scents in there that
I can't even pronounce but you kind of
get the idea I definitely smell the
vanilla coca tea kind of thing very
fruity but sweet
it would have to be getting my skin to
look like Jessica Alba's just kidding
I try with self-tanner though I just
love the pool and I love hot pink
lipstick
that's just how I can describe it I love
the summer because I love hot pink
lipstick I actually don't have any plans
for summer as of right now just kickin
it hanging out the pool doing me those
are my plans for summer I would love to
go like on a vacation to like the
Bahamas or something I had so much fun
when I was at the Bahamas a couple years
ago it was like my favorite trip ever
but as of right now it's what I'm doing
this summer
