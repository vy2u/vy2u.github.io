one of those I tried recreating a blank
makeup tutorial one of those videos that
have been going around recently
I don't know if I'm a little late I'm
always late to these trends but I've
been seeing you like everybody do it and
I really really wanted to do it too
I've actually recreated like Natasha de
Nona tutorials like twice on my channel
already I love following along to
tutorials that's how I learned how to do
my makeup through YouTube and just
following along to people's tutorials I
used to do that all the time so when I
saw this tag going around I was like yes
yes I believe Thomas however is the
first person to do this but like I said
I mean there's so many people who have
done this before I don't want to like
credit the wrong person but pretty sure
Thomas kind of started this I'm gonna
link his original video down below but
at first when I wanted to do this video
the first person I thought of was
nikkietutorials I really really wanted
to recreate a nikkietutorials look
because I really wanted to challenge
myself Hertha's whirls are incredible
she comes up with the craziest looks
things I could never really recreate I
don't have that kind of talent but I
really wanted to challenge myself and do
a look I wouldn't normally do on my own
but I saw so many people doing
nikkietutorials I didn't want to like do
another one so then I thought to myself
who else does really really amazing
makeup really crazy eye looks that's
super super talented and the other
person I thought it was raw Beauty
Christy she always inspires me with her
makeup looks they're just so amazing so
I thought you know what I'm gonna
recreate a raw Beauty Christy makeup
tutorial so I was kind of like scrolling
through her videos and I wanted to do
like a video I hadn't seen of hers
before and I came across this hot fire
cut crease using the colour-pop
yesplease palette and the look is
amazing like it looks incredible I'm not
sure if I can recreate that both we are
gonna try today so I'm gonna leave her
video down below and a lot further ado
let's just let's just try to do this
let's
try to recreate this I already
moisturized my face with the Clinique
Moisture Surge I've already moisturized
my face with the Kiehl's ultra facial
moisturizer which is my favorite this is
the Urban Decay quick fix Hydra charge
complexion prep priming spray I don't
have that priming spray so I'm just
gonna use the Smashbox photo finish
primer water because it does spray
primer so it's kinda like the same thing
what's not I think today for my
foundation I want to use the it
cosmetics CC cream and this is in the
shade medium I probably should be in the
shade light or light medium but you know
what right now I don't have that so I'm
gonna use this I do have the a cosmetics
CC cream actually but this isn't a shade
fair right I'm actually having the same
situation Christie was having this is in
the shade of fair and is it a little bit
too light for me right now I am
typically in the shade light but I don't
have light so I'm gonna use this guy
this is the it cosmetics bye bye a
foundation this is pretty much the exact
same product as their CC cream and has
SPF 50 it's literally the exact same
product only they charge you way more
for this and I don't know why
super-shady
in my opinion so I'm going to apply this
to my face using my cosmetics love is
the foundation brush okay here we go
I honestly don't know why this is more
expensive than the CC cream like I
really really don't get it it pretty
much does the same thing only this one
smells more like citrus than the other
one does I don't know that is so weird
that is really really weird but whatever
you
and now I'm gonna go in with the Cameo
contour stick from pure cosmetics in the
color light look at that
each one comes with a little cure
Cosmetics blending sponge
don't be fooled by that blending sponge
Christy they don't make them like they
used to the one that comes with that
contour stick sucks okay so I don't have
the pure cosmetics contour stick I used
to have that back in the day like when
they first came out but I didn't really
like it it wasn't it wasn't my favorite
so I'm gonna go in with another cream
bronzer that's kind of the same right
this is the Wet n Wild mega cushion
contour and I'm gonna use this to
contour the skin okay so I'm going to
take this one in wild P 70 brush and I'm
going to contour a bit
I know if she's like painting this on
her face but I don't have a stick so
she's also putting some of this on her
nose so I'm gonna put some of this on my
nose as well I just paused the video for
a second um those pur cosmetics like
contour sticks also come with a
highlighting side so she's like drying
it all over her face but like I said I
don't I don't have that product so oh
God so I am just going to contour and
then use regular concealer
I just realized she's doing her face
makeup before her eye makeup it's making
me really
okay I'm gonna take some of that on my
nose like she did I'm gonna take another
wet and wild brush yeah just oh god oh
god oh god wait that looks horrible just
gonna blend that in okay and let's
pretend that looks good me doing right
now you guys know that I'd normally bake
my face and I don't usually use the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
and this is not a new product to me that
haven't used it in about three years
let me blend this out first
actually you don't have the bye-bye
pores pressed powder from a cosmetics
anymore because I actually discovered
the Kat Von D blotting powder in light
the locket blotting powder and I find
this to be really really similar to the
cosmetics powder only it's better in my
opinion this really does cover and fill
in all of my pores it just looks so nice
on the skin so I hate to hoard products
I gave I have two products that perform
exactly the same I don't like to hold on
to that I mean sometimes I do but I just
got rid of my cosmetics one and that
used to be like a Holy Grail powder for
me I used to talk about it all the time
but I like the cap on do you want even
more okay so I'm just gonna set my
concealer with this powder
they don't have any new brow products
I'm just going to be using the Anastasia
dip brow and the color taupe and then
I'm gonna be using the essence make me
brow do to powder and I will be right
back I already did my brows I always do
my brows before I do any tutorial and I
used my honest ask you know today I used
the benefit precisely my brow in number
four yes please cute AF palette alright
so I'm gonna zoom you guys in and let's
let's do this just keep going with this
shade here which is the shade
now I'm going to go in with the shade
electrically this champs
I'm gonna go in with this one here which
is mischief okay putting that in the
crease meringue I think I might about it
a little bit too much of that first
color
look at me a Soren see know the truth
Joyce
so it got a little basic yellow down now
I think I'm gonna take a little brush
like this like a little packing brush
and I'm going to kind of deepen that up
I'm packing brush or carbon-rich we're
gonna add any more
see the truth
all right so many cuts same brush they
think I'm gonna dip into a little bit of
this shade here which is big cocktails
and I'm going to I thought she was gonna
say something else feel like I need a
little bit more of a fluffier brush for
this part okay maybe this one from LC
III
now I'm gonna take this sheet here which
is spoiled boxwood take it up on an
angle almost like a wind this is where
it starts to get complicated Oh God
and you have left your brush
I feel like my two eyes don't look the
same that's okay hmm
and then getting in there right where
the line is gonna be and kind of opening
up at the very bottom so that it like
gradients up actually I think I have
that brush
okay and she didn't mention it but I'm
pretty sure she's adding more yellow to
the inner corners because I see yellow
on her breath so I'm gonna do that add a
little more yellow into the inner
corners with that same brush because
pretty sure she's using that same brush
now I'm going to take my little Smith
cosmetics 3:02 brush I'm gonna go ahead
on my the best concealer I'm going to
use the Tarte shape tape concealer and
I'm going to carve it out underneath
where I just made that so that it's a
cut crease I've been practicing my click
creases these days so maybe this will
turn out fine will you show us is he
okay so she's using like a super light
concealer and I don't have the tarp
shape tape and such a light color so I'm
gonna use my color pop nofilter
concealer and light neutral which mean
look like I need a flatter brush I don't
know how I'm liking this kinda sealer
for a cut crease actually my
heart-shaped tape doesn't do this it's
getting a little patchy
you
like cool friends I'm not I'm not
pleasantly surprised I feel like they
look totally different but we're just
gonna roll with it I'm gonna use some of
these shimmer shades from the palette
oh when using my brush I'm gonna go in
with the shade butter cake just gonna
use what I already have here
I'm going to kind of add off my brush
and then use the color chauffeur same
with a damp brush yeah it's like way
better
oh but I think I like these shade okay
I'll do it with my finger this color is
so nice now I'm gonna go in with the
shade Louie
I'm the algorithmic started I'm not sure
if I'm supposed to let this shade she
didn't say if she wet it or not so I'm
just gonna go in with it dry and then
she kind of connects it here
so I'm gonna take a little bit of the
tart shape tape concealer and I'm gonna
take it on my Sigma small eyeliner brush
the e10 would you're like a little
negative space cut out I'm nervous okay
I need a tiny little brush like that she
has like a microscopic brush okay so I
don't want to use the colour-pop one I
was using just because I don't know I
looked a really weird on my lids so I'm
gonna take the vanilla shade in my NARS
soft matte complete concealer and do the
negative space with this I'm gonna take
this tiny little elf 13 brush from Elsi
negative space God to be with me
I'm gonna take my little precise lip
line brush PLO 6 from Sigma you just
kind of like buffing out the edges a
little bit
now I'm going to use eyeliner and I'm
gonna use this three different colors
because I want to keep up with the theme
of the gradient and some going to use
these NYX vivid bright eyeliners they've
been a halo a vivid delight and vivid
fire
okay so I actually have the two out of
those three eyeliners really really
exciting so I have the NYX vivid brights
in vivid halo and vivid delight I just
don't have the red one so instead I'm
gonna use a red liquid lipstick and hope
for the best
so yes let's go
okay so that liner looks absolutely
awful to me but we're just gonna go with
it
I'm gonna go throw some mascara and
lashes on and I will be right back so in
the video she actually is using the coco
goddess lashes but I didn't have those
lashes so bummed I was looking all over
for them right now but I applied some
other Koko lashes and these are the
style 201 random Koko lashes but yeah I
think I want to do the same thing to the
bottom so I'm gonna go in with that same
yellow shade and I'm just going to smoke
that onto my lower lash line on the
inner corner
wait wait wait pretty sure she just
added like the more reddish tone on the
inner corners right here but she didn't
sing it
Christy I'm pretty sure it's what she's
doing she's just doing like the gradient
from yellow to the reddish shade so I'm
gonna add that reddish shade in the
inner corners because I'm pretty sure
that's what she did unless she dragged
the orange all the way across but I
don't think so I'm actually gonna
intensify the orange part just a little
bit more so I feel like I blended some
of that away by the way I'm using the
Icaza medic superhero mascara I bring
with the makeup River transfusion I'm
gonna go in with my new a suntan
bronzer
okay I'm going to use the
nikkietutorials and Oh for collaboration
in I actually don't have the upper glow
highlight I gave that one to my friend
which is the nikkietutorials highlight
that has like the three separate ones
but christy is using the gold one in the
tutorial right now and I have the golden
right here because Oprah ended up well
Nicki and Oprah ended up releasing the
three shades individually so Christie is
using the shade glow goals so I've got
to use it too
and this sometimes connected to it my
texture a little too much so I'm going
to go in with the Physicians Formula
trimmer brick thing in the color natural
nude and I'm going to take the whiter
shade really beautiful and then I'm
gonna take that Rimmel stay matte lip
color in the color firestarter actually
don't have the Rimmel liquid lipstick in
firestarter so I'm just gonna use the
same liquid lipstick I use for my wing
this is the Sephora cream lip stain in
the shade 0-1
gonna go fix my hair when I get back I'm
gonna throw a gloss on top of this cuz I
want to be like a juicy red lip I'm not
gonna fix my hair that this as good as
going gay
I've got this in front of me so I'm just
gonna use it this is the Rimmel and Kate
Moss color number 11 I just want a
little bit darker in the center I don't
have that lipstick so I'm gonna take my
Maybelline divine wine lipstick I feel
like this might be a little bit too dark
but I'm just gonna go with it what buxom
blonde her description box says buxom
gloss in peach I'm not exactly sure
which buxom gloss that is but I do have
the buxom gloss in peach daiquiri so
maybe that's the one she used I'm not
sure I love these books and glosses
they're amazing so I'm just gonna apply
that right on top
and this is the finished makeup look I
hope you guys like it I really love it's
probably one of my favorite makeup looks
I've ever done here on my youtube
channel I love how this look turn oh I
thought it was gonna be a hot mess but
actually like how it looks
I mean hers does look better my little
negative space here looks a little
crappy and crusty so that's my bad but I
tried my best and I feel like it turned
out pretty good actually really really
like this look it's so like mmm
you know what I mean I feel like I need
to fix that crease but I'm scared to
mess it up so I'm just gonna leave like
that but okay guys that completes this
