even filming right now Porter Porter
Porter Porter Hey
because if you can see I mean like I
look crazy right now it's not my cutest
day obviously so I'm filming like this
and I know you could see the reflection
in my eyes because I'm in front of a
window but I had to put my glasses on
because then you'd really be scared
whatever I just wanted to sit down and
talk to you guys a little bit for a
little while I just got back from LA the
day before yesterday and I was still
like unpacking yesterday and still doing
so many things that I couldn't sit down
in the film so when I woke up today I
was like okay let me sit down and talk
to them for a little bit so that's what
if you hear Porter's Bell he's you know
he has a bell around his collar and it
makes a lot of noise if you guys don't
know the reason why I haven't been
posting videos is cuz I was in Los
Angeles for like a week I went a couple
days before IMATS and I went
specifically for IMATS
I was there on Saturday but that's why I
wasn't posting videos and it's really
rare for me I usually pre-record but I
had so many things to do to get ready
that I didn't pre record anything I only
pre-recorded the video that went up
yesterday and the video that went up
before that but anything else was not
pre-recorded oh well videos were
pre-recorded but I'll get into that now
so first off I want to say that I had a
really great time I you guys know that I
have like really bad anxiety and I was
kind of freaking out to do IMATS because
I knew I was gonna meet some of you but
I got like such an overwhelming response
like of love that I didn't have any
anxiety at all
alright buddy my nose little boy way
mine he knows a little boy well I'm a
puppy just wanted to the puppy disease
when we were about to park to get off
the car and I saw so many people like
outside of IMATS I almost had a panic
attack in the car and I was freaking out
but as soon as I got off the car and
like the first person came up to me and
hugged me it was like the craziest
feeling it's real
nice to like put a face to a name sort
of um I recognize some of you like I
remember some girl came up to me told me
her name and I was like hey I tweet with
you all the time um and it was just
really really nice like I cannot tell
you how blessed I feel and I know that a
lot of people probably have said this in
videos but I really do feel kind of like
strange like is this is this happening
to me like that's so crazy that people
like are happy to meet me all of you all
of you that I met were so nice every
single one and so beautiful and your
makeup was so pretty and you guys were
all amazing amazing amazing amazing I do
have some vlog footage I didn't vlog a
lot because I wanted to really just
enjoy my vacation but I've logged some
of it Danny was the one who did most of
the vlogging at IMAX because I was like
busy meeting you guys and stuff like
that I do have some vlog footage to put
up um it's not a lot but it's something
so I just quickly wanted to say thank
you to everyone who came up to me it was
the craziest feeling in the world
seriously the craziest feeling in the
world no one has come up to me like
wanting to meet me I don't know it was
so insane you guys were all beautiful
and amazing and just good people like
really good people Wow not that I
expected like bad people like I watch
your videos I didn't expect somebody to
punch me in the face but you guys were
so nice nope that was not any better I'm
just as scary looking and then that
night was the nyx event so we went to
the next event by the way i went to
california with nicole from young wild
and polished and danny like we went
together and then we went to the knicks
event at night time and it was so much

Saturday again a big thank you to you
guys that's why is it Saturday Sunday um
I couldn't get an IMAX ticket for Danny
so I wasn't gonna leave him out we kind
of decided to go sightseeing like I
wanted to see the Hollywood sign with
Hollywood Boulevard um we did a lot of
shopping that's one thing but I want to
ask you guys I did do a lot of shopping
at IMATS like I did a lot of shopping at
I met by the way before I went on this
trip I told myself like okay save some
money I went expecting to shop like I
wanted to go and you know just shop away
so I had saved some money before the
trip and I did some shopping a time at
which I will be doing a whole IMATS haul
because I think those halls are really
cool I got good deals really good deals
on stuff and brands I had never heard of
before too so I haven't I met tall but I
also went to Sephora and Macy's and I
did a lot of other stuff and I got some
other makeup stuff I did a lot of makeup
shopping so here's my question to you
guys leave it in the comments below
would you like to see two separate hauls
or not do my other haul at all like a
nine Mets ha and then like shopping in
California haul would you like to see
both leave a comment below like yes both
or no just IMATS yeah so let me know
down below so yeah so I did a lot of
shopping on Sunday and it was really fun
I went to California Pizza Kitchen I
there was really good um yeah that's
what I did
Monday I got to hang out with Jesse
smiles which is like a very popular
Viner Jesse smiles she's from Miami like
I am and she sees my videos and we kind
of just started texting and talking and
I love her Jesse's so like even cooler
in person she's really cool in her
videos in her mind she's like even
cooler her purse is so down to earth
really humble and like a really good
person really humble we went to Buffalo
Wild Wings and it was really good and
then we went to Sephora after even
though I had gone through so four of the
day before went to Sephora
and to the body shop whatever we did
like you know just hung out it was so
much fun I was so happy to meet her
because she's like so I love her so much
like I love Jesse lover that was during
the day and then colour-pop picked me
and Nicole up and took us to another
hotel the thing is that I wasn't gonna
stay in Los Angeles that long I was
gonna leave on Monday with Danny cuz
Danny left the Monday I was gonna leave
on Monday but colour-pop was like no you
know we want you to stay we want you to
come into the lab and work on stuff so
that is kind of what I wanted to talk to
you guys in this video you guys know the
colour-pop collab I did a few months ago
in November where I came out with my own
lippy stick and it just went over so
well that they reached out to me again
and asked me if I would come out with a
foursome which is like a quad of
eyeshadows and it went over so well and
it has such a great time and they got to
meet me and they got to like and I got
to interact with so many girls there
that I know if we kind of formed a nice
relationship and they asked me to come
out with four eyeshadows so when they
found out that I was going to be in LA
they were like we want to pick you up we
want you to come into the lab we want
you to like touch your own eyeshadows
and kind of help create your own
eyeshadows you know I just think it
would be a better experience so I was
like definitely I'll stay so I stayed a
couple extra days and Monday night they
picked us up and we went to the hotel
and then on Tuesday they wanted me to
come in the lab so I asked them if
Nicole can come with me because
obviously I wasn't gonna just leave
Nicole in the hotel by herself
that would be weird so I would be kind
of mean so I asked them if she can come
and they said yes so she got to share
experience with me and it was a lot of
fun it feels so surreal like when I
walked into the lab and they showed me
like I had talked to the girl on the
phone and told her like this is what I
want these are the four colors that I
want because you know these this is what
I want so when I went into the lab two
of them were already made and they were
perfect exactly what I was looking for
and then like the third one was being
made and the fourth one was being made
as well and I kind of helped tweak then
fourth one I wanted it just a little bit
darker a little bit this and I got to
like touch it myself and like ask them
to change certain things so I feel like
I had a lot to do with it and I swear it
was like the craziest experience of my
life
you know all the women in the lab like
not them not the women of like
colour-pop like you know the bloggers
girls and like you know the women in the
lab working their asses off to do these
eyeshadows they do it constantly I
showed after I showed after i shadow
they pack it they do it themselves they
pack it into the thing they put the
little imprint on top they do it but you
know all on their own
and they're the nicest women in the
world a lot of them speak Spanish it was
so cool a lot of them were Hispanic um
and they were so sweet so sweet one of
them asked to take a picture with me cuz
she watches my videos it was just it was
the it was the best day ever the best
day ever like the oh my god it was like
the craziest experience colour-pop
besides being a great affordable brand
everyone who works for color pop is
outstanding like an amazing person you
know Aaron and Jordan and all of them
they were so so amazing that's what I
wanted to tell you guys that there is a
foursome coming out very soon with a
collab with me and color pop and I got
to sit down on the computer with the
girl and I was like okay I want this I
want the box to say this I want the box
to look like this so I had a lot to do
with it and I'm I'm so happy that I did
and I know not a lot of people are going
to buy it because it's for eyeshadows
and it's sold in a bundle and it's $20
and as opposed to like five or ten that
the Libby stick and lippie pencil cost
but that's okay you know if you don't
buy it
that's okay I'm completely okay with it
the experience alone was amazing I hope
you liked the eye shadows they're very
me I can't wait to show you and talk to
you guys about them but they will be
releasing sometime in March so keep an
eye out for that I will be talking about
it like more in depth Selene Selene my
friend another thing so when I went to
the Knicks event where is it when I went
to the Knicks we met we got like a huge
swag bag like everybody who went to the
Knicks event walked out and they gave
them like a huge swag bag of like Knicks
products and a lot of the products in
the bag were things they were about to
release like things I haven't come out
yet they're about to release and one of
them that really stuck out to me where
the Knicks intense butter glosses this
is what they look like so they have
their regular butter glosses that are
amazing they're like I've purchased
every single one on my own and I love
them the butter glosses are amazing
these are the intense butter glosses now
let me show you how crazy this is like
they are intense in ten like it's so
crazily look at that way so I'm really
excited for these and I want I want to
know if you guys want me to do a lip
swatch video with all of the intense
butter glasses that I got I got quite a
few I don't know if I got all of them
but I got quite a few so that's one
thing another question that I want to
ask you guys is if you guys would kind
of be interesting interested in lip
swatch week I kind of want us to do
something called lip swatch week where
Monday through Friday I do straight lip
swatches of a bunch of different
products I wanted to do the intense
butter glosses the soft matte lip creams
I bought like ten soft matte lip creams
the other day just so that I could do a
lip swatch video for you guys I know
that's pretty creepy and pretty intense
but I wanted to do it for you guys so
these those I got I purchased six by
myself I purchased them six of the
Anastasia liquid lipsticks I wanted to
do lip swatches of those um like the
livecrime ones and stuff like that like
let me know if you would be interested
in lip swatch week so yes those were my
two questions one do you want me to go
to separate halls or you
me to do the other haul you just want me
to do I'm a tall and - would you be
interested in lips watch weak I look
like a train wreck in this video so I'm
gonna wrap up this video I'm really
sorry for the lack of videos I should
have proof oh my god no I'm not done you
guys have no idea what happened to me
okay so talking about the lack of videos
okay so I have had the craziest morning
today because I was unpacking last night
but then I left my laptop like in the
laptop carrier whatever so I went to
take it out so that I could edit the
video I filmed with Nicole we did a
would you rather tag dogs my freakin
dogs I went to go edit it and my hard
drive was gone I looked everywhere I
looked in my suitcase I looked
everywhere I completely lost my hard
drive and I have a feeling that I lost
it at LAX Airport because it doesn't
make sense that's the only time that I
ever took it out to take out my laptop
to like go through screening and I
remember taking out my hard drive and I
think I remember putting it back but I
could be completely wrong um I called
LAX nowhere to be found I called the
hotel nowhere to be found I didn't leave
it at the hotel it's gone
warder dude take it easy and I text
Nicole and I'm like did you accidentally
eat like pack my harddrive please tell
me you did and she's like no I
completely unpalatable so I lost it I
had to go today
run to the store and buy another hard
drive and not only that like my Ipsy bag
unboxing video for this month was on it
so that's gone I can't post that on my
channel I can't post the tag cuz that's
gone and then I had all my videos on
that hard drive like months and months
of clips of videos and that's gone I
always work off my hard drive like every
time I'm going to upload a video like I
upload it to my hard drive first and
then I work off of that because it
doesn't take up like space on my
computer because video editing takes up
so much space so yeah I just really
wanted to tell you guys that because I
know somebody you're gonna be like hey
where's the tag because I tweeted I
tweeted about it that I was filming that
tag video and so yeah this is a super
long video of absolutely nothing so I'm
really sorry thank you guys so much for
watching I'm gonna start posting three
times a week again from now on this was
just a little setback because I was on
vacation so I will be posting a lot more
now I hit 500,000 subscribers I haven't
talked about this on my youtube channel
because I hit 500,000 subscribers when
my plane landed in LA and Danny was the
one who told me Dan he's like well my
mom told me but then he was like oh my
god you hit 500,000 favors and then he
was so happy about it and I was just
like oh it like put me in a great mood
for the rest of the trip like half a
million people Porter
don't be mean half a million people
subscribed to my channel it's insane um
so yes I know that Danny promised that I
could do his makeup when I hit 500k and
I'm gonna actually film that video
tomorrow so that video should be up very
soon probably excuse me probably on
Monday so yes okay and now rambling oh
my god I love you I'll see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
