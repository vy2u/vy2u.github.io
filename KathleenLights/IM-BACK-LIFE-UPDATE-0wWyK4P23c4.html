missed you guys so freaking much I don't
even know where to start I haven't
filmed the video in so long that I don't
know where to start
how about the beginning okay so the dogs
are here
well lighting issues already people are
thinking too much anyway if I sound
super echoey and right now is because I
don't even have that much furniture in
this room right now just my jewelry box
and this guy right here I don't have any
other furniture and my IKEA drawers in
front of me like my desk that you guys
are used to seeing um isn't in this room
yet it's still just like wrapped up in
the living room I haven't even unpacked
that desk but anyway to start off I did
move recently for those of you who don't
know I moved which I hope a lot of you
do know if you have been keeping up with
my social media I had to move because of
Danny's job I had no other choice but to
move so we did move to Florida I'm from
Miami originally a lot of you guys know
that I'm original by the way I'm a
little sick right just saying I am
originally from Miami and we did move
back to South Florida because of his job
but I did not move back to Miami but
pretty darn close I would say closer to
the Florida Keys that is where I moved
to close like Key Largo back that area
if you're from if you are from Florida
then you know what I'm talking about
I am excited that I'm closer to family
but I do not like South Florida at all
actually just a lot of like crappy
memories and certain things if you guys
watched my anxiety
video video that was a weird accent if
you guys watched my I can't deal with
this echo it is driving me nuts
if you guys watched my anxiety video
then you know why I just I don't love
South Florida anymore I just don't feel
happy and comfortable here but because
I'm not close to Miami I am gonna get
used to it or I could get used to it
that makes sense i'ma making sense I
don't like how Miami makes me feel it
because we lots of anxiety a lot of
pressure but I'm not that close to Miami
so I get the best of both worlds I guess
I get my family pretty close but then I
hope so I'm not that close so yeah I do
love my family and I'm very excited to
hang out with my friends that I haven't
hung out with in four years because I've
been in Mississippi and all that stuff I
am excited I we will not be living here
for the rest of our lives
Annie's job is constantly forcing us to
move so I don't know how long we will be
here but we will be here for a while I
will I do know that we'll be here for a
while so this will be my filming room
for a while now let me talk about that
real quick I just wanted to point out I
moved this Ram and I have been so
incredibly stressed out guys like so
stressed out because well today is
Tuesday March 3rd and my internet was
supposed to be here
on Monday I told you guys yesterday I
told you guys that the internet wasn't
going to be insult til Monday and I was
super bummed out and then yesterday
nobody showed up to install the Internet
Danny had to call them it was a huge
issue and now I won't have internet till
Saturday which is pretty much a whole
freaking week away I have never gone
this long in
entire life without posting a video I've
never gone like two weeks without a
video so I'm going to try to go there's
a local like little ice cream shop
around here I'm going to try to go and
sit down eat some ice cream and then
upload a video because on the front of
the it says free Wi-Fi so I want to see
if I can go use their Wi-Fi and upload
this video that you're watching right
now so if all goes well you should be
seeing this video on Wednesday March 4th
but if not we won't be seeing this video
till Saturday I don't have a Starbucks
super close to me because if not I would
have gone to Starbucks but I don't have
one that close so yeah that is the
internet issue I'm really sorry guys I
don't you guys know I post Mondays
Wednesdays and Fridays and I'm so sorry
that I haven't been posting I
pre-recorded a ton of videos guys I
moved out of my apartment in Mississippi
February 5th so every video that you saw
after that was pre-recorded I haven't
filmed since from here I haven't filmed
a video an entire month which is crazy
but those were all pre-recorded I tried
my best to pre-record as much as I could
but I thought by now I would be able to
sit down on film but I can't because I
haven't got an Internet another thing is
that I didn't know what I was getting
into like I didn't know where we were
moving to exactly so I didn't know of
the size of the windows in this room I'm
sitting directly in front of it and it's
a tiny tiny little window and you guys
know that I am a natural lighting kind
of girl I don't use artificial lighting
in my videos and I use the studio lights
I use windows because that's what I've
always like to use but it can't in this
room the window is too small and the way
that my desk is positioned it's going to
be like over here and the window is that
make sense like I won't be able to get
matched from lighting in this room so I
have to buy studio lights some of you
are thinking your lucky stars we
because sometimes people tell me that my
videos are too dark kind of like right
now it's getting dark
some people tell me my videos are too
dark other people really love my natural
lighting I personally love natural
lighting but I will have you know the
studio lights that profession now look
to my videos very soon I do have a ring
light I have a very expensive ring light
that I bought and I broke by mistake I
accidentally broke it recently so now I
have to order a new bulb hopefully I can
replace the bulb because all I broke was
a bulb if I have to buy a home a ring
light whoo-ho they I have to replace the
bulb on that and then get like actual
studio lights to set up in this area so
I can film so that's another thing I
can't
orderly lighting because I don't have
internet and I have no reception in my
house which I'm telling you it's been
like one headache after another I got
here and I was like oh I won't have
internet till Monday but at least I have
my phone and Sprint sucks in this area I
don't get reception whatsoever so I
can't even get on the internet using my
data and order studio lights because I
can't I haven't I can't so that's the
problem so now I have to wait till
Saturday to order lighting so that'll
probably take like another week I won't
have studio lights for another two weeks
so that is not going to stop me from
filming though I'm going to be I'm gonna
be filming videos but I'm going to be
filming them in front of this window for
now and I hope you guys don't mind it's
only going to be about two weeks of this
like natural lighting before I can film
like actual good videos and
able to do this tutorials like I always
do facing my mirror on my vanity where I
have to suit like the light bulbs so my
tutorials will still be on point that
will be affected at all till I hit my
studio lighting but yeah when I do other
videos like favorites videos and stuff
like that I will be filming the window
for now so I hope you guys don't mind of
you guys um it's not it's only gonna
look like this just for a cup like a
couple more weeks two weeks and the echo
will be gone soon when I put my desk in
and yeah I I feel like I'm talking out
of my arse right now like I'm just
rambling I haven't filmed in a month and
I don't even know what I'm saying but I
just wanted to give you guys an update
like I'm here I moved I'm in Florida
this is what I'm working with right now
let's talk about this let's talk about
this room for a second well this is my
new like a beauty room I guess you would
call it I love my old one when I when I
came into this house the walls were
yellow like the color of the of this
this is the closet door and that's the
door
the walls were that color and I was like
we don't like them I didn't like them
they were like a little bit mustardy
looking through like I don't know so I
painted my walls like an off-white silky
white to be exact it's like a grayish
white you can't tell but it's not
exactly white and Danny is going to be
painting these doors tonight when he
gets home from work so if you're looking
at that like that is super ugly wires
why is that randomly yellow but now I'm
gonna be painting that as well it's
pretty much going to be the same setup
as my old room I'm going to do
everything exactly the same I'm going to
decorate my desk exactly the same and
stuff like that it's gonna be pretty
much the same thing I'm just you know
working on it I'm working on it guys
working on it it's been a real struggle
and I've been super stressed out which
is why I didn't reply to anybody in my
drugstore haul that I recently posted
because that posted automatically and I
don't have internet in this house so
usually I always go back and reply to a
bunch of people and I couldn't reply to
anybody and it was killing me it was
like literally killing me because I hate
not being able to interact with you guys
on a daily basis and it's just the only
way I could the only way I can even post
and update you guys on Twitter and on
Instagram is if I like go down the
street to Walgreens where I have
reception I'm telling you it's a
struggle and since I've been home
constantly like cleaning unpacking
styling and done if you saw my house
right now you'd be like oh I'm still
unpacking it's a mess also another thing
is since I started heating my YouTube
channel I've always lived on like the
second floor except when I was swimming
in my dad's house but my room was like
facing the backyard um here I'm like on
the ground because it's not an apartment
and this room is directly where the
street is and people are constantly
passing by on that sidewalk right in
front of my window so people are gonna
start to wonder what the heck I'm doing
in here so yeah I think that is pretty
much everything I have to say I expected
to say a lot more information in less
time but this video is going on like 20
minutes
and I haven't really talked about
anything but I just wanna let you guys
know that I hear you guys I know that
your library videos and it's killing me
it's killing me not posting but as I
promise guys listen to me
as soon as I get my internet running
Saturday hopefully hope hopefully guys I
hope I get outside of it soon as I get
my antenna running I will be posting a
video like every single day I'm going to
make
time the week that's coming like after I
get my internet on Saturday Monday I'm
gonna post video Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday and Friday I mean I
will be facing the window it's gonna be
an ugly background I mean this is what
you're gonna see but I will be posting a
lot and as soon as I get my studio
lights in the mail you know what's on
back to the way things used to be just
please don't go anywhere guys stay here
love me I'm so sorry that I haven't been
on the Internet
I just I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
so yeah I'm going to try to edit this
video really quickly and then go to the
ice cream shop to see if I can upload it
but if I can't and you'll be seeing this
on Saturday hmm yeah I hope you guys
understand and I hope you guys won't
like unsubscribe or like leave me
because I would really suck I love you
guys so much and I miss you so much
if I do post this video on Wednesday
like if you're watching this the day it
goes up on Wednesday
I won't be able to reply to comments
because I won't get internet till
Saturday so I hope you guys understand
that but if this did go up on Saturday
then I would be replying because I am an
earnest I mean I feel like I am not
making any sense
I need to practice because I forgot how
to do this so yeah my next video that
will be going up hopefully in a couple
days will be my February favorites video
those are my favorite videos to film and
I don't care if it's March 15 I am
posting that video I'm filming that
video so thank you so much for watching
