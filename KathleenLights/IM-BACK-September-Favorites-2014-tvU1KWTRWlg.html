my September favorites I'm going to talk
about all the products I've been loving
this month I don't know if you could
already tell but I am sick I have a cold
ah I know is it super stuffy and like my
eyes are constantly watering I feel like
I'm getting a fever I don't feel well
and I wasn't going to film a video but I
just got back from vacation I have been
on vacation for the past two weeks and I
just got home but I really hate being
late on my monthly favourites videos so
I figured if I wasn't gonna film it now
I wasn't gonna film it ever actually
because I've been on vacation and
because I've been traveling I don't have
a lot to share with you guys at all I
have very very little to talk about so I
decided to kind of combine in this video
it's gonna be my favorites and I'm also
going to be talking about where I've
been and what I've been doing kind of
like an update sort of so if you
actually do not care about me or my life
or what I've been doing then you can
just fast-forward this video to get to
my favorites but I decided to combine
the two because I just I feel bad I
don't want to do two separate videos and
I just don't have that many favorites so
anyway the past two weeks I have been
uploading pre-recorded videos so any
video you saw before this video was all
pre-recorded well September 12 I left on
vacation and every video after that was
pre-recorded because I knew I was going
to be in Miami for two weeks and I
wanted to put some content up and right
before I left Mississippi to go to Miami
I kind of scheduled them all to post
automatically so I didn't have to go on
YouTube and post them myself and I
realized that I pre-recorded a lot more
than I needed to I usually post about
three videos a week and I recorded a
bunch so I decided to just post them all
which is why there was so many videos
posting in the past two weeks and
actually one day I kind of messed up on
the scheduling and two videos posted in
the same day and I don't know why they
were just all crammed together my
scheduling was off and I posted them all
weird so yeah I apologize for that
but don't get used to it I actually had
a lot of videos post the past two weeks
but I'm going to go back to posting
three times a week maybe more sometimes
I post more than three times a week it
is
usually Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays
so I left to my enemy to visit family on
September 12 and we were there for about
a week and then I went to California I
went to Ontario California to visit the
showroom from the brand le girls they
invited us over there me and Danny went
and it was a really nice time we went to
Disneyland while we were in California
and it was a lot of fun I met two
subscribers in Disneyland and it was so
crazy because I have never had anybody
come up to me and it was just really
cool they were both really really nice
and it was fun I'm from Florida
so I've been to Disney World in Orlando
like a million times and going to Disney
them was nice it was like a cool
experience to go to the Disney in
California which is by the way where I
bought this shirt Mickey it says
Disneyland on the bottom it was really
fun but I was kind of disappointed in
the size of the castle if you are
familiar with a Disney World and it's
the Cinderella Castle it's the blue
castle it is huge so when I saw the pink
castle it's the Sleeping Beauty Castle
the one in Disneyland in California I
was like it's a lot smaller like a lot
smaller and I was disappointed in the
size of the castle Disney World is
better than Disneyland that's just my
opinion it's bigger I'm pretty sure
Disney World was like the original
Disney I'm not sure I could be making
that up but I had a really good time I
was there during the weekend and then I
flew back to Miami and I was there for
about another week visiting family and
then um we left on our way back home to
Mississippi since we drove on our way
back home we stopped at Orlando and we
went to Universal Studios and Islands of
Adventure and then we went to Halloween
Horror Nights which is also in Universal
and then we went to wet and wild which
is a water park in Orlando so we did
like four things and I guess all that
really took a toll on me that's why I'm
sick well a friend of mine who I went to
Halloween Horror Nights with she was
sick too so I think she got me sick but
I guess it was a mixture of the
waterpark and all that stuff that I have
like this caki cold uh but I had such a
great time I also met a subscriber in
Islands of Adventure as well so that was
really fun I'm the biggest chicken I
don't watch scary movies at all
I don't like to be scared I hate it and
I actually had a really really good time
in Halloween Horror Nights and I'm
actually all beat up because of Orlando
like while I was at the water park I got
this cut because I flew off of a raft in
one of the rides I just literally just
flew off and landed like under the raft
and scraped whatever and then this
bruise look at the size of this is Bruce
like that is not normal look at this it
hurts so bad this happened to me on the
Harry Potter ride in Universal Studios
it's like their new roller coaster kind
of Harry Potter ride and we didn't know
that it was a roller coaster because you
can't really see it's it's indoor and as
soon as it went down it does like a
sharp turn and Danny like flew over and
pinched my skin because I don't know how
to explain it like he pinched me like he
landed on my arm and I got this giant
giant bruise so that's what I've been
doing these past two weeks and I know a
lot of you guys have been asking about
our vlog Channel because we haven't been
vlogging and no I didn't vlog while I
was on vacation just because I wanted to
take that time and spend it with my
family and spend it with Danny I really
wanted to vlog especially in Universal
Studios and Islands of Adventure but it
was raining in Universal Studios so it
was yet I don't know I just wasn't able
to blog and I wanted to take the time to
just spend it with friends and family so
I'm really sorry for those of you who
wanted me to vlog I couldn't but I'm
back home so I will be vlogging a lot
more and there will be vlogs going up on
days of our lights so don't you worry so
yeah that is basically what I've been
doing I just wanted to quickly update
you guys from now on every video after
this will not be pre-recorded it will be
all up to date oh yeah I'm gonna go
ahead and get into my September
favorites so if you guys saw my what's
in my travel makeup bag video you guys
know that I didn't really take a lot of
stuff on vacation which is why I don't
really have a lot of favorites but while
I was in Miami I got this and it is my
new obsession this is a blush from
makeup geek and it is called
infatuation and it is beautiful I have
been using it non-stop since I got it
this is the blush I'm wearing on my face
and I like it because it's like a brown
color so this also works as a bronzer I
have it like on my cheeks and on my
temples a little bit this looks so so
beautiful on so many different skin
tones I really really love it the
undertone in this is just so flattering
and it just gives your cheeks like a
bronzy look and I love like really warm
bronzer cheeks and this is amazing it is
matte and it's beautiful I quickly
wanted to mention that another thing I
want to mention our eye shadows and
these are very old I've had these
forever but they are wet and wild single
eye shadows and I have mine in the color
panther which is the black one and then
I have this one which is called creme
brulee I believe I don't have that name
on it anymore but pretty sure it's
called creme brulee and it is just like
a matte cream color and this is a matte
black I wanted to mention these because
I feel like wedding world has really
really gone downhill like in the past
year I want to say less than a year I
feel like they're new
palettes do not have as much pigment as
their old palettes
they're trios are amazing and have a
bunch of them but recently they came out
with like some palettes that have like
five different colors and they just
weren't as pigmented as I wanted them to
be and I'm really shocked because out of
all the drugstore eyeshadows I thought
what a wild was like the best like the
absolute best but recently they're just
not so good these are incredible these
are their single eyeshadows and I
believe that they are a dollar each
which is crazy inexpensive and they're
so good I wish that their quality was as
good as this again like if they just go
back to this quality I don't know if
they change the formula on the
eyeshadows I don't know why but I wish
they would go back to this formula it's
amazing this is the perfect brow bone
shade or the perfect like all-over lid
shade I have this as my brow bone
highlight today and it is just so
beautiful and then this is the best
black eyeshadow when it comes to the
drugstore like if you are looking for a
perfect matte black at the drugstore I
definitely recommend Panther I have it
smudged like on my
Asha's today to just make like a little
bit more of a smokey look and it's
amazing the best black for a dollar you
will ever find in your life and I just
wanted to mention these because I feel
like their single eyeshadows are so so
great and I recommend them and I just
wish that their quality would go back to
this because this stuff is so good
keeping on with eyeshadows this next
thing has probably been the best
discovery this month my absolute
favorite thing in the world now I've
gotten so many questions on my channel
within the past few months to please do
a tutorial using the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette but I never owned it just
because I felt like I didn't need to
because I already had so many neutral
palettes and it really really was not
interested in the palette at all but
while I was in Miami I got it and oh
Lord I am so obsessed I don't know why I
never bought this I really really don't
know why because it is amazing the
colors look really basic and bland and
neutral but they're not they're so so
good that the pigmentation is amazing
and they're very buttery
besides Urban Decay I think that Too
Faced has probably one of the best
formulations of eyeshadows I have ever
seen high-end wise I think it's great
and all these eyeshadows just works so
well together it's not your basic
neutral eyeshadow palette I mean it is
but you have like a nice deep burgundy
here a very vibrant purple here you have
your gold your champagnes your pinks I
don't know it has everything in here I
love that the two large eyeshadows in
this palette are highlight shades you
have your matte highlight shade which is
a really beautiful very pigmented cream
color and then you have this highlight
shade right here and I feel like people
always hit pan first on the highlight
shades because we use them every time we
go to do our eye shadows so I love that
the two big shades are highlight shades
I never thought I would ever say this I
never did I swear if you guys really
watch my channel a lot you know that my
all-time favorite palette in the world
is the Naked palette from Urban Decay
the original and I think I might like
this palette more than my original Urban
Decay Naked palette which is a crazy
statement I'm not
I'm not going to say that it is my
favorite yet because I haven't had this
for so long but it might be and honestly
that reason is because you get so many
more matte shades in this palette you
have this one right here this one this
one it's just great the Urban Decay
Naked palette I feel like it's lacking a
really really dark matte Brown and this
one has it right here this is the only
palette you need honestly if you are
into neutrals it's amazing and it smells
like chocolate I can't I can't smell it
right now because my nose is stuffy but
it smells like chocolate so not only is
it great but it's like a joy to put on
because like I smell it while I'm
putting on my makeup it's just amazing I
definitely recommend the chocolate bar
palette if you were iffy about it go get
it it's great I want to quickly talk
about this eyeliner this is the Jessie's
Girl liquid eyeliner this is the best
liquid eyeliner ever when it comes to a
brush tip it is waterproof
it's amazing whole video on this where I
compare it to the Kat Von D tattoo liner
in trooper and this is just as good and
it's a fraction of the cost so I won't
buy the Kat Von D one anymore I will
continue to purchase this one it is
amazing it stays on my lids the entire
day I mean it's waterproof and it does
not budge it's great I get mine at
Jessie's girls
Jessie's Girl cosmetics calm I believe
that's the website or you could find
these at Rite Aid and pretty sure they
sell Jessie's Girl rite aid but if you
don't have a Rite Aid near you then go
to Jessie's Girl calm or Jessie's girls
cosmetics I don't know it is a great
great um liquid eyeliner and it's six
dollars I definitely recommend this
perfect drugstore product it is so good
I love it okay just have two more things
to share with you guys this next product
or products were recommended to me by my
sister Alette and it is a shampoo and
conditioner that I have fallen in love
with completely and I'm regretting not
buying the large large versions of this
but it is the Paul Mitchell our Pookie
I don't know if I'm saying that
correctly well Pookie wild ginger rising
lab
puh and the keratin cream rinse this
keratin cream rinse is the conditioner
but I love this this is sulfate free
that is my number one thing when it
comes to shampoos and conditioners I
need to have sulfate free shampoos and
it lathers really well it's called
moisturizing lather shampoo for a reason
you would think that their sulfate in
this because it's just a lather is
really really well just a little bit of
water in your hair and it does such a
good job of lathering up and it smells
amazing oh I don't need all that I love
the way that this smells it smells like
a mixture of the this smells like a
mixture of bubble gum like pink bubble
gum like you know like the bubble gum
with a little bit of mint in there I
don't know I don't know how to explain
it but it smells so so good it cleans my
hair really well and I was mostly
impressed by the keratin cream roots
this stuff is incredible I've never used
a conditioner that made my hair feel
like it was in a hair mask do you know
I'm saying like I will use deep
treatments hair masks in my hair all the
time as conditioner because I feel like
some conditioners don't condition as
well as hair masks but this does this
makes my hair feel like I had just put
on a hair mask for 20 minutes it's so so
good it smells wonderful and it leaves
my hair so soft that I could literally
detangle it in the shower in no time
it's so nice it says detangles and
revives and it makes my hair so soft I
definitely recommend this I got mine at
Cosmo Prof I don't know where you can
buy this it's the brand Paul Mitchell
but the our pour you one I don't know
where you can buy this I got mine at
Cosmo Prof I don't know if they have
this at Ulta or anything but oh I reckon
I really regret not getting the larger
versions of this and I don't have a
Cosmo Prof near me here in Mississippi
so darn but I love it I've been loving
these my last favorite is this little
guy right here and it's not a very
interesting product but it is my
favorite favorite trap stick of all time
this is the hurrah moon balm it is blue
camomile vanilla this is the night
version like you wear it overnight and
it is the best lip balm I have
ever ever used I put it on every night
before I go to bed and when I wake up my
lips are so soft I've always suffered
from like super super super chapped lips
and I haven't had chapped lips since
I've been using this lip balm and it is
all-natural it's made from premium
organic vegan and raw ingredients so
it's a good chapstick it's good for you
you don't have weird chemicals on your
lips it's the best traffic ever it is
only three dollars I believe or 350 very
inexpensive and it does the job I have
always wanted to try the bite agave lip
mask but it's too expensive and like I
see people buying like Dior creme de
Rose and it's a $30 lip balm and I'm
like there are some things I will
splurge on lip balm is not one of them
and this is cheap and fantastic amazing
I recommend it I want to try the other
flavors of this but the moon balm does
so well and I think maybe the fact that
it is the moon balm it might moisturize
or hydrate more than the other ones and
it smells it smell so good when I put it
on I want to eat it and you and you can
because it's vegan so I really love this
chapstick definitely check it out I got
mine I herb calm I don't know where else
you can buy it but I can mine it I heard
calm so yeah that completes this video
those were my September favorites I know
they weren't a lot but I was just
traveling so much half the time I wasn't
wearing makeup um I know that I'm like

the dumps and not my usual self
