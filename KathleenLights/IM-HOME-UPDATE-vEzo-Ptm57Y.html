look body look is my portal got my pata
I'm not exactly sure if you can see me
the Sun is like in my eyes so I'm like
looking down a little bit I look crazy I
haven't put on makeup in like 17 years
but I quickly wanted to update you guys
because I haven't posted a video in a
while which is very unlike me I haven't
posted in like a week more
hello truck I quickly wanted to make a
video because I feel like I needed to
update you guys I've done two other
updates I will link down below if you
guys have no idea what I'm talking about
I have been in the process of moving for
three months we had bought a
pre-construction home you guys know so
the home had to be built which is very
very common a lot of you guys have told
me that you purchased pre-construction
homes and taken way longer than you guys
thought so I'm not alone but it's
finally done it's this right here it's
my house this is a my little thing where
my hose goes what is this called the
faucet I don't know about the outdoors
life but anyway I just want to let you
guys know that I am already in my house
I'm not living at Denny's dad's house
anymore I am in my house there has been
a few issues I thought I would have
internet by now the only reason you are
watching this video right now on your
computer is because I have to go to
Danny's dad's house to upload videos
because I won't have internet for like
three weeks and it's a really long story
something to do with the wires and the
cables exterior it into like a whole its
I'm stressed if I look at the lens the
Sun hits me in the eye I almost cried
when I heard the news but the good thing
is that I live really close to Danny's
dad so I'm just going to be going to as
how three times a week to upload videos
so while I'm here while I'm home I will
be posting often I'm going to try my
best to go back to my three times a week
schedule starting next week I'm going to
try my best so you are watching this on
Friday I should have a video up on
Monday and Wednesday and Friday of next
week I should be going back to my
schedule my room is a mess
my beauty room is a hot mess I have
makeup all over the place it's crazy and
as soon as I get everything settled I
should be doing a beauty room tour and
like an updated makeup storage
makeup collection Beauty room thing but
it's going to take a while I mean it
looks like hurricane Kathleen I've got a
lot of questions if I'm going to do a
house tour and I'm not going to be doing
a house tour for like privacy reasons I
have a beauty channel and I want it to
stay like a beauty channel and I know
you guys want to get to know me more
which I have no problem with that I'm
very open on my channel but that's me
but myself person
but when it comes to like my home and
Danny and like stuff like that I'm a
little bit more private Danny is a very
very private person he's very private
and even though he's like on the vlogs
and on the videos he likes to keep his
personal things personal so yeah I won't
be doing a house tour I'm so so sorry I
know that I was getting tons of
questions about it but I will be doing a
beauty room tour I will be showing you
guys my beauty room and everything like
that and I'm sure you guys are gonna see
my house in the background of my videos
whenever I do videos where you see like
you know vlogs or in the background of
my house in my bathroom like you know
skincare routines and I like it stuff
I'm sure you guys will get a glimpse of
my house but like an actual tour like
this is this and this is this I I just I
don't think I'm gonna do and I hope you
guys understand and I hope you don't
take that the wrong way there's just
certain things I don't want to put on
the internet but anyway that's the
situation I'm here you know I'm in my
home and I'm getting things situated I
won't have internet for like three weeks
but that's not gonna stop me I will go
to whoever I will go to anybody's house
