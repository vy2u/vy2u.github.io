yes I'm blunt like like I'm blunt like
my hair is white
that's how fun that is you can't really
tell that much but like the ends of my
hair like towards the bottom like
they're white like I look like Khaleesi
if you don't watch Game of Thrones you
have no idea who Khaleesi is I'm a
little bit blonder than expected not
gonna lie
little blonder than wanted then I want
it to be I know a lot of you guys are
not going to be a fan of my blond hair
and that's okay
honestly I agree with you I do think
that I look better with darker hair I
don't like the really dark hair on me I
personally don't like that but I do
agree that my hair looks better a little
bit darker but I haven't a brunette for
21 years and I have never done anything
drastic to my hair ever I've just always
been afraid of changing my hair and I
thought you know what I wanted to do
something crazy and I just wanted to go
freakin blonde I'm not going to lie I'm
probably going to go back to brunette in
the future in the near future maybe I'm
probably going to stay blonde for a
while and then eventually just dye my
hair like a light brown and then leave
it like that for the rest of my life and
not touch my hair anymore because after
this little blonde process that I've
been going through my hair is pretty
damaged I've done some damage to my hair
and that's pretty obvious when you're
dealing with bleach but the way I see it
it's just hair hair grows back um there
are people in the world who suffer from
so many sicknesses that they don't even
have hair and honestly if your biggest
issue is that your hair is damaged I
mean you gotta look at the bigger
picture so I just wanted to come here
and say yes I am blonde and a lot of you
guys so you hear this name
yes I'm blonde and a lot of you guys are
going to absolutely hate it who knows
but it's just hair
you know what I mean who cares okay
enough rambling and now on to the actual
video which is my monthly hips even
boxing let's go okay first of all how
cute is this bag oh my god this bag is
incredibly cute it's gold with hot pink
zipper and has this little thing which
makes it even cuter right I think so I
love that they added this none of my FC
bags have that little thing on it anyway
so the first thing in the bag is this
nail teeny nail polish and Ipsy sends a
lot of the nail to nail polishes to us
which I'm fine with because I really
like neo teeny oh it's pretty um the
color I got is called caviar carp cat
okay B color I got is called caviar
cocktail why is that so hard to say I
don't know and it's just like this
metallic silver color it's actually
really cool I love metallic colors by
the way swatches of everything will be
at the end of this video as per usual
these nails Tina nail polishes are 13
dollars a pop which is produced by a
sieve for a nail polish so that that's
even more than the cost of the Ipsy bag
so that's nice
okay next thing in the bag is this pixie
bronzer pixie Beauty bronzer in solis
untouched in it my bronzer came broken
huh I'm so upset that my bronzer is
broken right out because literally out
of the entire bag this is the thing I
was most excited for because I know that
everybody was getting this it's broken
look
do you know why this happened to me the
other day my friend Gabby was telling me
how she got um the mary-lou manizer in
the mail from the bomb she when she
ordered online it came in the mail and
it was broken when she got it and then
um I was telling Danny I was like oh my
god that's so weird none of my products
ever break in the mail like I always
have luck with all my products I just
never break when I get them in the mail
I obviously do get broken things in the
mail now clearly this is a little hint
of karma
but anyway nonetheless it seems like a
beautiful color let me see let me swatch
the cap okay so it's a very very subtle
um
bronzer color but it is really beautiful
it has like a satin finish it doesn't
have any glitters or anything but it's
not 100% matte it is really really
pretty actually and it feels like butter
this actually looks like if it wasn't
broken it would be very beautiful I'm
still going to use it though obviously
but yeah and I love the packaging on
this like the outside feels like NARS
packaging you know what I mean like
rubbery yeah if that matters to anybody
this is a full-sized Pixy bronzer and
these are $18 Pixy is a pretty expensive
brand sold at Target so I'm not
surprised that these bronzers are $18
but I've heard really good things about
the brand okay moving on next thing in
my bag are these kiss ever easy lashes
these are the natural lightweight
reusable lashes it even comes with a
little um eyelash applicator I don't
know how good that is but yeah I
actually never wear false lashes I've
worn false lashes once in my life but
besides that I I never wear false lashes
which I really want to get into wearing
false lashes more just because I feel
like it pulls the look together like
when you do tutorials and stuff like
when you just add lashes at the
no more tutorial I just feel like the
look looks so much nicer I don't know so
I'm kind of really excited that I got
these lashes just so that it can kind of
open the doors for me so I can start
getting into false lashes for videos and
stuff so yeah I hope these are good
I need to buy eyelash glue now though oh
and the price of these lashes are $5.99
so the next thing in the bag is this
starlooks eyeliner in the shade amethyst
God are you serious hi anyway we've got
an a starlooks eyeliner and one of our
FC bags before I think it was a couple
bags ago maybe last bag I remember and
it was just a pure black eyeliner and I
was not 100% impressed it was a little
bit rough on my eyes not going to lie
but um so I don't know how this is gonna
go this isn't the color amethyst which
is a very very pretty metallic purple so
you can see right there it takes super
metallicky so I mean this could be a fun
eyeliner I just don't know how rough it
is if you know what I mean and if you
are wondering what the price of this gem
pencil that's what it's called that's
what it says right there if you are
wondering the price of this gem pencil
it is $14 so that's it pretty penny
moving on the next thing in the bag is
this be a bombshell lip crayon in the
color shameless it says the color right
on the box by the way by the looks of it
every single thing in the Ipsy bag of
this month has been full-size which is
awesome so yeah I just wanted to point
that out this is what the lip crayon
looks like is a gay burgundy red and
it's one of those twisty ones I love lip
crayons and the color is pretty sheer
and you can tell has some sort of reflux
in it
not like sparker sparkers sparkles not
like sparkles or glitter or anything
just like it's kind of like a pinky red
in the tube it looks like burgundy but
it's more pinky red it's pretty and the
last product is what I think everybody
was most excited for everyone got a
full-size product from the M cosmetics
line which is Michelle Phan's
makeup line if you didn't know and if
you don't know who Michelle Phan is
she's like the beauty YouTube God pretty
much so like I said everyone got a
full-size product from the end cause
Matt explained and I got the water liner
intense color eyeliner which kind of
bummed me I did check out my glam room
on epsy before I got my bag just to see
um kind of the things that were going to
be in my bag so that I can write down
the prices that I can tell you guys in
the video how much everything costs and
I saw that I was getting a water liner
from M cosmetics and I was like two
eyeliners really but now that I see that
there are two different colors I'm okay
with it the color I got is called bronze
kiss which makes me excited because that
means it's a bronze color which you know
me and my warm colors I love me some oh
this is actually a really cute little
eyeliner because it comes with ace oh
this is this a sharpener it comes with a
sharpener apparently and then it also
comes with a sponge like for you to
smudge out the eyeliner so that is cool
and let me swatch the color so it glides
on really really smooth and it's
actually a really nice deep chocolaty
color it has a little bit of a sheen but
I really really like it this is totally
up my alley oh and these and water
liners retail for $20 ok guys so that
was everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month I really really liked everything I
got pretty much if you want to see
product application then stay tuned to
the end of
video so thank you so much for watching
this video please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next one right okay you guys know the
drill sometimes try out these products
and clean this mirror really quickly
though I'm going to swatch this nail
polish on my fingers it's just basically
your typical um metallic e nail polish
this is just one coat actually so it's
pretty freakin opaque pretty impressed
pretty impressed okay I'm gonna try out
the be a bombshell lip crayon if you're
wondering what's on my lips right now I
have on the covergirl LipPerfection
jumbo gloss balm in ballet twist uh this
is probably my favorite lip crayon
of all time I love it this does have
like little tiny micro shimmers in it
now that I put it on my lips I
definitely see it what do you guys think
okay I'm going to try the M cosmetics um
eyeliner okay I know one little
heavy-handed there but I want to see how
well it smudges okay so I think that the
little smudger is a little bit actually
way too rough for underneath the eyes it
kind of hurt a little bit when I was
trying to smudge out the eyeliner but I
think it would be amazing for the
waterline now I'm going to try these
star looks gel pen in gel pencil in
amethyst I don't know where I'm gonna
pop this cuz it's purple button here
goes nothing okay so I put it on my
eyelids and then blended it out a little
bit and put it put a little bit on my
tight line and it's not very rough it
does go on pretty smoothly it's not the
smoothest eyeliner in the world but I
think this would be really good to put
like all over your eyelid kind of like
blend it out and then put some like
purple eyeshadow on top I think that it
would give
like a nice pop so I do see myself using
this okay now I'm going to try my broken
Pixy bronzer and I already have bronzer
on let me tone it down a little bit I'm
going to use my Real Techniques blush
brush and tap some on the cap it's
actually really nice I like it it's not
oranjee at all I like it okay guys
that's it
I hope you enjoy me trying on the
products I don't know if I'm just
wasting my time or what but yeah
bloopers oh my wallets my hair can you
put her there thank you
think you're the best has been of the
older</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
