worst lighting did this what no so you
guys know I don't vlog I don't do blogs
anymore I used to have a long time I'm
not comfortable deleting but yet I don't
upload anything on there so it's like I
don't know it's still there for now but
anyway like I was saying I don't really
blog anymore you know I used to do it
when it was just Danny and I living in
Mississippi but I'm just such a person
that when I moved back to Miami I wanted
to keep like my personal life personal
and private and then the beauty side of
my life
keep it on YouTube you know like it's a
beauty channel we talk about makeup we
disconnect from reality for a while and
it's time but today I feel like I need
to vlog today I feel like I need to
document today and mainly for me mainly
for me to look back on this video and
watch it and this is what I'm hoping
I've developed a new fear of concerts I
wouldn't call it a new fear I've always
kind of been scared of concerts but when
it's past events it's gotten worse I've
only been to one concert in my entire
life and that was in 2009 I believe his
concert was there was the battle studies
concert John Mayer which anybody who
knows me knows I am a John Mayer fan I
love his music his lyrics speak to my
soul literally love him and I went to
his concert in 2009 with my friend
America it was the most amazing time
ever we sat all the way like in the back
we saw John Mayer like this big but it
was the best time just it was amazing it
was anything I never experienced
anything like that I'd never been to a
concert and that's the last concert I
have ever been to and for me I feel like
I really have to love someone to go see
them in concert because I'm just not a
concert person I've never been a fan of
concert I don't like crowds and concerts
are very crowded but I also love Selena
Gomez and I have bought links front row
tickets to Selena Gomez this was like
last year and I was so excited for
months and months I was so excited to go
to that and then unfortunately the thing
was christina grimmie happened like the
day before or two days before and it
just it shocked me so badly and I
freaked out and I didn't go to the
swimming the Gomez concert I gave away
my tickets my sister went by herself I
was supposed to go with her or she took
her cousin and I remember that I cried
on my way home like I dropped off the
ticket to her house
I went home I just cried and cried and
cried because I couldn't believe but I
wasn't allowing myself like I was so
scared I wasn't allowing myself to go
see Selena Gomez who I loved and then
when I saw when I saw that John Mayer
was coming to Miami on tour again almost
eight years later I freaked out America
called me like immediately and she's
like dude John Mayer is coming back and
I bought tickets immediately and I have
been telling myself since I want the
tickets like months ago I've been
telling myself every single day like you
are going to this concert you are going
to this concert I can bilaminar all this
if anybody's 1/4 inch the mall to get
dressed right now and I didn't want to
serve Emilia because the meat is in the
other room watching big little lies I
have been mentally preparing myself
because I back out of things that I find
scary and today today today's a jobbing
hunter and I'm going and I am so excited
I got us tickets and we are so close to
him we were so close and I'm still
trying to be going with America again
because we literally went seven and a
half years ago it was amazing I will
insert pictures here so you can see I
was like 17 years old it's insane how
different our lives are now and I'm so
sad to be going with America again
because we share that love for John
Mayer
she loves John Mayer in different ways
that I do see like she lives down there
like oh my gosh I want to marry you
get in my pants John Mayer and I love
him like oh my gosh we are soul mates
through your lyrics like we are lyrical
soul mates because I don't fancy John
Mayer like I'm not liking gamma-gamma
I just love him deeply and emotionally
spiritually I love him my hair album of
all time is battle studies when that
album came out I was going through so
many things that related to so many
songs on that album that was crazy so
I'm excited to search for everything is
also a really good album my favorite
songs on the album are Rosie live on the
weekend in the blood I will make the cry
okay so anyway I'm gonna get dressed now
I don't know how much vlogging I'll do
and yeah I wanted to vlog today even
modal vlogging Mars it's kind of like a
random rambles video but not really I
just want to keep this moment I want to
keep today so I'm going to block it yeah

just we got to one and it was great
[Laughter]
get you some
maybe
then who's there kay Gaston manages to
Japan
you're through
okay that was amazing
Toby's enjoy what I was able to post it
was so incredible it was even better
than I thought it was going to be it's
like a really really late right now I
have to go to bed but I wanted to just
tell you guys that it was amazing and it
was so surreal seeing him so close I
have been a John Mayer fan since I was
10 years old literally my mom got me a
karaoke machine for Christmas and she
got me like the CD that one with the
karaoke machine I don't even know what
CD it was the first song was John Mayer
your body is a wonderland and I had
never heard of him before that was a
first song I had ever heard of John
Mayer and I fell in love with that song
it was my obsession when I was 10 I
thought it was so beautiful and ever
since that's on every single album I
purchased I love I love John Mayer his
lyrics are special to me it's so weird I
don't know how to explain it but I have
a good deep connection to his music and
it was great he played a lot of my
favorite songs
my favorite John Mayer song of all time
is heartbreak warfare and he didn't play
that but I'm sure I saw in the clips
he had an encore and he played edge of
desire the desire is my second favorite
song on battle studies which battle
studies is my favorite I really do like
the search for everything the only song
on the album I'm not crazy about is
never on the day you leave that was my
favorite but I really loved all the
other ones and he didn't play still feel
like you're meant that's the only bummer
of the night I really wish you would
have played that one but besides that it
was amazing he played gravity I mean
that's how it changed my life I have the
lyrics tattooed on my foot
it was incredible and I had a lot of
anxiety when I got there but once I sat
down and I kind of saw like the opening
band perform and once I don't know like
I started to feel better and then when
John Mayer came out it's like my anxiety
just drifted away and I was in a dream
where I was listening to my favorite
music and it was great so I hope you
guys conquer your anxiety soon I hope
you do something that your anxiety has
held you back from do
for a long time I hope you do it I hope
you find the strength to do it soon
because cannot let our anxiety win and
for me it went a lot of the time like
simoleons of time anyway I have to go to
bed now good night I love you guys thank
you for everything I hope you guys have
an amazing week ahead of you and I love
you and please subscribe already now see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
