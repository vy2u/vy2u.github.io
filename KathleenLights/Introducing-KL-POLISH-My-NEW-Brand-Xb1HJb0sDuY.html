crazy one oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god I'm so excited I'm so excited
it was like I have never been so nervous
to film a video in my life and I'm
filled with so many emotions and I don't
even know where to start I have been
hinting for a while that I was working
on something that was not a collab and I
was mainly dropping hints on Twitter and
Instagram but every time I wore a nail
polish that I'm gonna talk about today I
would write in the description box that
I couldn't tell you what it was yet but
but that it wasn't a collab and a lot of
you guys caught on really quickly most
of you you you knew you know and that's
what this video is about today so we are
gonna discuss these holy crap it is
official I have come out with my very
own brand my very own nail polish line
this is not a collab with a nail polish
company I know a lot of you guys were
kind of commenting on Instagram like I
thought you said you were giving collabs
a break for a while but I mean I am I am
giving collabs a break for a little
while and I'm doing this I'm doing KL
polish which is the name of the brand I
don't even know like I feel like I have
so much information I don't know where
to start I had to give myself a little
bit of a pep talk in the mirror today
like please don't cry in this video just
don't cry in this video people are over
you crying you cry in every video but I
can't make any promises I can't believe
I'm finally able to sit down and talk to
you guys all about KL polish I'm going
to give you guys so much information I
know there's so many questions I'm gonna
discuss each color the names all that I
know all the stuff you want to know and
I'm gonna insert some swatches and some
close-ups you know all the good stuff I
will leave little notes in the
description box if you want to see
specific things because I know this
video is going to be long so as a lot of
you guys know I have had the most
amazing opportunities working with
different brands all thanks to you guys
I've been able to collab with all the
brand's I have because of you guys you
open those doors for me and I will
forever be thankful for that because
without my subscribers I really wouldn't
have the opportunities I have so thank
you always for that and creating
products
was just so much fun for me and creating
Lumiere like the process was something I
had never done before and it just I feel
like a lit a fire in my soul it was
something I loved so much I took so much
like it brought so much joy to my life
and all I was doing was creating a shade
and a name and I didn't realize how much
I loved it until I was doing it which I
guess is why I've collab with so many
brands and I've created like a ton of
lippies with color pop and Miami fever
and how about a nights with Oprah and my
makeup peak palette and my morphe
palette like those projects the process
just made me realize that it it's
something that I wanted to do as well
it's something that I wanted to do on my
own as well it was just so much fun and
especially interacting with my
subscribers seeing you guys wearing my
eyeshadow palette or seeing the
highlights on your face it brought so
much happiness to my life knowing that
you loved a product that I made or that
I created the shade you know what I mean
it was a great feeling and I knew it's
something I wanted to pursue and I know
immediately everybody's first thought
would be like oh your own makeup brand I
have a beauty channel where I do makeup
so it would only make sense for me to
have a makeup brand and don't get me
wrong that's not something I am keeping
off the table if it's something I can do
in the future I don't see why not but
it's not something I wanted to do right
now I always saw myself owning a makeup
brand I mean after I started youtube of
course like I grew a passion for that
and I always saw myself having a makeup
line but it was always kind of like in
the future was always like years away it
was not something I wanted to do right
now it's not something that's on my mind
I have to be honest it really isn't I am
focused on kale polish and it kind of
hit me one day when I was doing my nails
in the kitchen I always do my own nails
I'm not perfect at doing my nails by the
way I am NOT a professional manicurist
I'm just a girl who loves freakin nail
polish and that's the only way I could
describe it and it was so funny because
my mom was actually the one who came up
with the idea we were sitting in my
kitchen and I was painting my nails and
I was telling her that I you know I had
so much fun with collabs and I would
love to just create something for my
subscribers that totally 100% came from
me you know my own formula and I was
telling her all of this while I was
painting my nails and she was just kind
of staring at me like you have always
been obsessed with nail polish she said
that in Spanish but you know she's like
you have a million frickin nail polishes
in your closet
changing your nail polish you're
constantly talking about nail polish
it's not something I talk about so much
on my channel but in real life I haven't
ditches to nail polish I do I have since
I was a little girl and as she was
explaining it to me I was like oh my
gosh
but yes why did I think of this myself I
know what I love I know the formulas
that work for me I love working with
different colors like I just love
creating stuff and I really couldn't
think of a more perfect thing so I did
what I had to do to make it happen and
here we are I I got together with like
my management team told them this crazy
idea and we made it happen they helped
me out with like the business size of
things they helped me find a
manufacturer they did my photo shoot
they did all of that but this is my
brand I know a lot of people were
confused wondering if it was like some
sort of collab but it's not it is 100%
kathleenlights which is what KL stands
for
obviously I know I didn't have to
explain that to some of you and I am
truly so proud of it I'm so happy with
everything it was such a long process
but it was so fun I designed the bottles
picked the logo the formula the colors
literally literally everything I tested
out a few formulas before I found the
one that I really loved and I loved it I
will go into every single shade every
single detail of each shade in just a
minute but I will let you guys know that
KL polish officially launches on
December 5th I will have the website
linked down below oh yes there's a
website I mean of course there's website
I have so much have to say it I don't
even know it's okay so the website is KL
polish calm I will leave it down below
all six shades are on the website now to
pre-order there's only one that is sold
out for pre-order and that is the shade
Zoe show you in a second if you have no
idea what the hell I'm talking about
you probably don't follow me on social
media besides YouTube so I'm so sorry if
I'm confusing you but pre-sales went up
a few days ago and Zoe is officially
sold out for presale all of the other
shades are still available but all six
will be available on December 5th when
they like officially launched we wanted
to do a pre-sale because we wanted to
see the response and since it was like
the first official launch of a new brand
we wanted to see how that was going to
go but we do have Zoe in stock for
December 5th all six shades will be
available on December fit but for those
of you
you want to preorder the link is down
below you should be receiving your
polishes the week of the fifth earlier
than everybody else who orders it like
an actual launch day if you don't follow
any of Cael polish social medias you
totally should it's kale polish on
everything on Twitter on snapchat and on
Instagram we haven't really done
anything with snapchat yet I'm working
on that we have a team that runs those
accounts it's not actually like me
running everything that would be insane
there are other people working on the
Twitter and on the Instagram just in
case you have any questions you need to
be answered but also of course I mean we
have a customer service email I mean all
of that is on the website I would get
below if you have a question in your
mind check the website first because it
might be answered in the FAQ section
yeah I'm gonna get into the colors now I
just wanted to tell you kind of like the
origin of kale polish how it came to be
so this is what the bottle looks like I
went with this style bottle I mean I was
going back and forth for a while I
didn't want the bottle to be like really
bulky or big I wanted something that can
store easily I wanted a simple sleek
bottle and I wanted it to have kind of
like a thick glass on the bottom and I
knew a thousand percent that I wanted a
soft-touch cap if you don't know what
soft touch means it pretty much is the
nars style packaging it feels kind of
rubbery to the touch I knew I wanted a
cap like that because I love the look of
matte black but on top of that it's
really easy to open your nail polish
bottle if you have something to grip on
versus if it was a shiny cap that's
slippery it's not so easy to open your
bottle and sometimes when you have nail
polish for a long time it's hard to open
the cap is probably my favorite thing
about no the brush is my favorite thing
but I really love the cap on these
bottles I'm someone who just likes a
clean sleek look and I think that's what
this bottle is very simple but very
modern and chic at the same time I love
the bottles and then you just have like
the ingredients here on the back how
much product you get so each nail polish
has point 41 fluid ounces and then on
the bottom you just have the little
sticker that has the name of the nail
polish as most nail polishes do so I'm
very happy with the packaging I hope you
guys are happy with it too these nail
polishes retail for $8 and 5th
which I personally think is a pretty
affordable price it really was the best
we can do and I personally I think the
price tag is great especially for the
formula in my personal opinion of course
this is my brand that's so weird to say
but of course this is my brand so I'm
not gonna sit here and say the formula
sucks I think the formula is amazing
all of these nail polishes are opaque
they're not watery but they're not goopy
and they last a really long time on my
nails every formula I tried out I made
sure that it didn't chip one wood chip
the next day like up this formula
garbage I hate it I was on the hunt to
make a nail polish that lasted on my
nails now everybody has different nails
there are certain nail brands that chip
within one day on my nails but other
people I know say that it will last a
whole week on their nails it truly
depends on the person all my closest
friends would try out these nail
polishes throughout the week and give me
some feedback my sister actually wore
brick sidewalk like in a vlog I was
wearing them in videos all the time like
you guys saw I really dedicated my time
to this formula and I am extremely
impressed with it I love it so I hope it
works for you guys as well as it works
for me it was also really important to
me that this formula was 5 free which if
you don't know what 5 free means it's
pretty much a nail polish that's free of
5 harsh chemicals formaldehyde
formaldehyde resin come for I believe
and then like two other ones that I
cannot pronounce and nail polish is
actually 7 free it has like two other
ingredients that are not in this that
are harsh and it's also paraben free and
acetone free so it's like 9 free all of
the nail polishes are cruelty free and
they are made in the United States I got
some questions about like pairing
companies but the parent company is me
and the manufacturer we use is cruelty
free as well if you want more extended
information like I said earlier there is
an FAQ page on KO polish calm that page
also has a list of the ingredients for
each of the nail polishes in case you
really want to know each individual
ingredient oh I forgot to mention as of
right now we are currently only shipping
to the United States and to Canada and I
know I know a lot of you guys are really
upset about that and trust me I am too I
want you to be able to get your hands on
these if you do want to so I know those
of you in the UK are very up
set and all of you guys overseas but
nail polish is so tricky because of
certain chemicals and things like that
nail polishes cannot be shipped through
air it has to be shipped grounds so for
those of you overseas they would have to
like go on a boat and all of that and it
would take weeks and weeks so I'm
currently trying my best to get a
distributor overseas it is definitely
something I'm working on so please bear
with me I think those were all the major
details I wanted to talk about formula
all that stuff but talk about my
favorite part which is the colors and
the swatches and the names and the
creative part of this whole process
which is my favorite part
so I released six shades this one
doesn't have a sticker under it because
this is actually an older bottle it even
has a completely different wand oh I
forgot talked about the wand but anyway
accidentally gave the new brick sidewalk
to my friend Stephanie for her to wear
this week and I completely forgot I was
filming this video today so I had to
pull out my old brick sidewalk which is
the same exact colour in formula it just
doesn't have a sticker or a brush I'll
get into the brush here in a second but
I created six shades to come out with
first and I'm pretty sure that's the way
it's going to look like from here on out
if Kayle polish is something people
really like I want to be able to create
tons and tons of different nail polishes
for you guys to wear these six might not
be your cup of tea but hopefully in the
future something will be I kind of want
to release collections seasonally like
fall winter spring and summer but I will
have like some fun things thrown in
between I mean I don't know I don't know
where this can go
this just in my mind you know I am
currently working on my spring line as
we speak I'm not exactly sure if I'm
allowed to tell you guys that but I
totally did these are the six shades in
me collection a lot of you guys know
this but a few months ago I tweeted to
you guys asking you what kind of brush
you prefer it on your nail polishes I
also tweeted you guys asking you what
kind of formula you preferred on your
nail polish your voice your input means
way more than anything I want to make
sure that I'm creating things that you
guys love obviously everybody loves
different things and I'm so happy to
announce that I agree with you guys on
most of the things I did a little pull
on Twitter asking you guys if you liked
skinny brushes or like whiter brushes in
your nail polishes and so many of you
guys preferred a wider brush which may
me so happy because I prefer a wider
brush I hate skinny brushes in my nail
polishes it's just way harder to use and
your nail polish looks streaky if you
have such a skinny brush they drive me
crazy I don't like them so this is what
the brush looks like it's kind of a
medium-sized wand that's a bit flat but
it isn't too thick it's not too fat it
has more of that paddle style wand and I
love that it's rounded at the very tip
instead of just being a stark straight
line because the way that this wand is
set up it's really easy for you to get
really close to your cuticle in the back
but without flooding your cuticle and
hey I'm someone who struggles painting
my own nails I'm left-handed
so whenever I try to paint my left hand
it is a mission and a half I struggle so
much and this brush helps me if you're
someone who struggles with painting your
nails I really believe that this style
wand would help you it's less messy in
my opinion because it just cups your
nails so nicely okay so now let's get
into each color now that I've officially
talked about everything so this is the
shade Zoe this is actually our best
seller in terms of pre-orders I mean I
don't know how things are gonna go on
December 5th this is the one that
everyone was buying the most which I
totally saw coming it's such a beautiful
dusty mauve shade
I love the undertone in this a little
bit cool toned but still a beautiful
mauve nonetheless this would look so
good on so many different skin tones a
lot of you guys seem to appreciate that
I had different hands on my website I
wanted it to be a major point that KL
polish doesn't only swatch things on one
skin tone on one model so on the website
there are three different models wearing
the same color and I find that extremely
helpful and to show the public that you
consider different races and different
skin tones so it was really really
important to me to show that kale polish
is for everyone this beautiful mauve
shade is named Zoe and a lot of you guys
asked me to go into detail on why I
named each product I always do this like
whenever I do collabs I talk about the
names and I've got to be honest coming
up with the names arm is my favorite
part about it Zoe is actually named
after Amelia's daughter if you've been
watching me on YouTube you know that my
best best best best best friend her name
is Amelia and
she has a little daughter named Zoey and
she's also my goddaughter so I was
raised Catholic
Amelia was raised Catholic so I haven't
done it yet but I will be there to
baptize Zoey she's my goddaughter and I
thought it would be nice to name and
nail-polish after Zoey so the next
Polish I want to talk about is called
snickerdoodle and it is this really
pretty creamy nude these all have by the
way I forgot to mention that was Zoey
but these all have a cream finish
none of these nail polishes have any
shimmer any Sheen none of that they're
not matte by any means they dry glossy
they dry with a shine all of these do
but they don't have any sparkle to them
which I know some people might say like
wow why didn't you give kind of like
options not just cream colors but these
are my favorite nail I also did a poll
on Twitter and a lot of you guys said
you preferred creme nail polishes over
shimmers so I wanted the first launch to
be solely creams I loved creams more
than anything as well
well shimmers be something I do in the
future absolutely I'm actually working
on something that might launch on my
birthday that might be shimmery I don't
know so that's just a nigga doodle this
is a creamy nude it is a neutral but I
would say it has a hair of warmth in it
definitely not a cool toned nude this is
my favorite on tan skin oh my gosh it
looks beautiful on deeper skin tones
absolutely gorgeous I love this color on
my best friend Amelia it looks stunning
on her and I named it snickerdoodle
because it kind of reminded me of the
middle part of a snickerdoodle and if
you don't know snickerdoodles are my
favorite cookies of all time so I had to
name one snickerdoodle had next up we
have this bad boy right here and it's
the one I'm wearing on my nails right
now this is my third favorite out of all
of them this is a beautiful deep deep
deep navy blue but there's like so much
life to it it's like a vivid navy blue
and this one is called gumption and a
lot of you guys caught on to why I
called the gumption which made me so
happy the movie the holiday is my
favorite Christmas movie in the entire
world it's with Kate Winslet Jack Black
Jude Law and Cameron Diaz that movie
makes me cry of pure happiness every
time I watch it it's the strangest thing
but Emily makes me so happy and Kate
Winslet has a moment in the movie I was
going through something kind of Sam
in my life and that movie made me
finally move on from the situation that
I was in and I felt like I had that
moment at the same time Kate Winslet did
like that movie gave me gumption to do
what I had to do so I have like a weird
connection to the movie and a weird
connection to the word gumption and next
up we actually have my favorite favorite
favorite color out of all of them this
is a beautiful deep mustard shade and it
is called gotta mellow and when I was
thinking of what nail polishes I wanted
to come up first this is probably the
first one I knew I wanted in my head if
you guys have been watching my channel
for a long time you know that I have had
an obsession with Bobby Brown's eye
shadow in the shade Hamel I knew that I
wanted to turn that eyeshadow into a
nail polish so that's kind of where it's
them from that specific eye shadow and
my mom actually came up with the name of
this we were sitting there we were
discussing what we could possibly name
this and my mom was like hey buddy I got
a mail Oh like it reminded her of that
candy and I was like perfect oh my god
got a mail oh that's literally the
perfect name so that is what I ended up
naming it and I'm not just saying this
because it's my nail polish but I get
complimented so much when I wear this
freakin nail polish so much like more
than anything I get so many compliments
so I love gotta Maya it's my favorite
favorite favorite next up is my second
favorite and that is this guy right here
this is brick sidewalk it's a very
beautiful rusty red it's a red but it's
like a terracotta red and when I was
doing the photo shoot for this nail
polish I wanted my lips to match my
nails perfectly so I mixed actually I
mixed Havana nights and Miami fever
together and it created this shade like
on my lips I freaking love this shade so
much out of all of these even though
gotta mellow is my favorite out of all
of these this is the one that I've worn
the most and it goes with so many
different looks it just goes with
everything I rarely see nail polishes
with this undertone and brick sidewalk
just came to me when I looked at it
doesn't it look like a brick sidewalk I
don't know some names have no rhyme or
reason I just look at it and think oh
yeah snickerdoodle oh yeah
brick sidewalk so how does not end it
brick sidewalk and then last but
certainly not least it's this beautiful
deep chocolate it's like a pure
chocolate shade this one is called
broccoli
chocolate and I got so many questions
like why the hell did you name that
broccoli and chocolate I was sitting at
home and laughing on my couch because I
posted a black and white photo of the
stickers and I kind of asked you guys to
guess based on the names what the shade
would be and for broccoli and chocolates
so many of you guys thought it was like
a greeny Brown kind of like a dirty
green or like a brown with a little bit
of like a green duochrome
and I was like man that makes perfect
sense they're gonna be a little shocked
to see it's just brown but I love these
colors for winter and for fall the name
is actually an old mary-kate and Ashley
Olsen song a lot of you guys don't know
this about me but I had a sick obsession
with the Olsen twins my sister was like
part of the Olsen twins fan club they
would like send her books we were
obsessed with mary-kate and Ashley
we have all their videos we would watch
them all the time we memorize them I
know every single word to almost all of
the Mary Kayden Ashley songs and they
actually have their first movie it's
called our first video and it has their
matching CD and it's called I am the
cute one that was like their big song
from that CD and one of the songs on the
city is called broccoli and chocolate it
was one of my favorite songs on that CD
I love that song till this day I think
it's so funny it's the weirdest freakin
song ever if you ever get a chance to
listen to it google it on YouTube
American Ashley broccoli chocolate the
weirdest song ever but I loved it when I
was little and so when I looked at this
shade and I was like wow that looks like
a Hershey's bar like it looks like a
true chocolate
boom instantly that song came to my mind
so yeah those were all the colors I hope
you guys love them I'm not a
professional at nails
I'm not a nail guru by any means but I'm
someone who truly truly loves nail
polish and if I can create amazing nail
polishes for you guys that makes me so
happy I feel like you don't have to be
perfect that's something to have a
passion for it I want you guys to know
the face behind kale polish you know
like I want you to know it's coming from
me and it's coming from the heart
creating these colors was so much fun we
actually shot a commercial for this line
it's gonna go up on my channel on
December 5th so keep your eyes peeled
for that it was so fun to shoot and even
though I'm so weird in real life like I
don't think people realize how weird I
am in real life I am the most awkward
most shy human being on the planet I was
a person in school that even though I
knew the right answer I would
raise my hand I was sweating profusely
filming that commercial it was just it
was oh my gosh I love you guys I say
this all the time and I don't I don't
want to sound repetitive but fact that I
am even holding these little bottles in
my hands is it's so surreal and when I I
saw a glamour feature the nail polish
looking wrong it freaked me out I had
major like but I still feel so grateful
and even though it still struggle like I
let myself get in the way of a lot of
things I hate traveling it scares me so
much but you guys have helped me try to
overcome to that I have found so many
friends in this community I recognize
the people who always comment you guys
have brought out a more positive
kathleen and thank you for continuing to
watch and continuing to support me and
you guys are the reason i'm holding this
in my hand and i am eternally grateful

this kale polish journey takes me
hopefully you guys love this brand i put
my heart as education into this the
night before the website went up i was
on the website literally like nitpicking

more than just about showing you these
nail polishes it was about me saying
