tutorial on the look I'm wearing right
now I wanted to do something with purple
and blue and I was totally inspired by
this eyeshadow right here
this is a buxom palette that I created
myself they sell like single shadows on
Sephora from buxom and then I just
created my own and put them in this
buxom palette I'm using other eyeshadows
in this video as well but this eyeshadow
right here is like a bluey purple
iridescent so pretty totally inspired
this whole look and I really like how it
turned out very fun and glittery but
really easy to do there's no wing liner
no false lashes and I actually love it
so if you want to see how to get this
look then just keep watching okay so I'm
going to start off with my eyes and I'm
using the eyeshadow primer potion in the
shade enigma by urban decay to prime my
lids now I'm going to take this buxom
eyeshadow it is called
Kashmir craving I believe yes Kashmir
craving and I'm just using that to set
down that primer now I'm going to take a
fluffy blending brush and I'm going to
apply makeup geeks eyeshadow in the
shade carnival all over my crease going
back and forth and building up that
color now I'm going to take this
highlight by the brand city color it's
called intense exposure highlighting
powder and I'm using that underneath my
brow bone and then I'm going back into
that fluffy brush and just blending
things out I'm going to take a foiled
eyeshadow by makeup geek this one is
called masquerade it's such an intense
vibrant purple I love it so I'm just
applying that to my entire lid and then
I'm going to go back in with carnival on
a smaller crease brush and just blend
out the edges of that shadow
now I'm going to take this peachy Brown
called invite-only this eyeshadow is by
buxom and I am buffing that into my
crease and then I'm going right back in
with masquerade and intensifying the
color a bit because once you blend too
many shadows in your crease the lid
shade kind of blends away so I'm just
going back in with that lid shade and
then I'm lightly blending out the
corners I'm gonna go ahead and jump to
my face makeup this is the NYX do me up
primer very very hydrating perfect for
dry skin and then I'm going to apply my
foundation with a Beauty Blender sponge
this is the josie maran vibrancy
foundation and I'm in the shade electric
I don't know how I feel about this
foundation I've been using it on and off
for a few weeks and some days I like it
but some days I don't I probably will
not be repurchasing this it's just not
my favorites now I'm going in with some
concealer and I'm going to use this to
kind of mask my dark circles but also
highlight different parts of my face
this is the Born This Way concealer by
Too Faced and I really really really
really have been loving it it gives me a
nice medium coverage I have concealers
that have more coverage but I just love
the finish of this it's a nice medium
coverage and looks so healthy and
natural on my skin I love it by the way
this isn't a Beauty Blender this is a
sponge from the brand mascara okay
moving on now I'm going to take my Real
Techniques setting brush and I am
dipping this brush into the NYC loose
setting powder and I'm setting
everywhere I put that concealer on my
face moving on I'm going to take this
Giorgio Armani liquid summer bronzer
this is shade number 10 and I'm using
this bun should just dab this on my
forehead and on other parts of my face
where I would normally add bronzer not
so much to contour but to just add some
warmth to my skin and then I'm going to
speed this up because I'm literally
bouncing this thing for like 45 minutes
in real time it's insane
I'm exaggerating but I'm just bouncing
the sponge and blending this into my
skin it gives a really nice natural tan
look perfect for summer now I'm moving
on to this color pop highlight this is
in the shade lunch money and I'm using
this little Kiko brush to just apply
this to the tops of my cheekbones
I'm going to add some more bronzer to my
skin this is a bronzer by the brand Joey
it's the shade suntan I love this
bronzer I've been using it non-stop
since like January when I discovered it
love how like thin it is and how easy it
is to travel with and it just gives you
a nice tan look to your face as well and
Lovi moving on I'm actually going to do
the little baking thing I never really
do this but I thought that maybe my
bronzer was just a little bit too far
down so I'm taking that NYC powder and
just applying that with my sponge and
then I'm going on a little dance break
because I wanted to wait a couple
minutes before I took this off maybe
like two minutes nothing too crazy I'm
taking this blush by the balm and I was
so excited this is the first time I was
using it this is called bomb beach and
it is the most beautiful like pinky nude
blush ever I love it so much
I'm going back into that city color
highlight that I used underneath my brow
bone and I'm using this to highlight Zee
cheekbones as well
okay so let's finish up these eyes I'm
taking this makeup geek eyeshadow in the
shade 2 and I am just buffing this right
on the outer corners of my eyes I want
to add just a little bit of depth to
that purple just a little bit of
smokiness right at the outer corners
nothing too intense or too noticeable
I'm taking this buxom eyeshadow in the
shade
and I'm applying this to the inner parts
of my eyes not on the center but a
little bit more forward and closer to
the inner corners of my eyes just
building up that color I want it super
super intense and iridescent I love it
I'm taking this Anastacio waterproof
cream color and this is in the shade
ocean and I'm using this to line my
waterline any like baby blue periwinkle
blue will do by the way I'm so sorry
that in certain Clips my face looks
warmer like the clips are warmer in some
parts than in others it's something with
my camera settings I don't exactly know
what's going on but I just recently
bought a new camera so I'm very excited
to try to upgrade and hopefully this
won't happen anymore
so anyway for my lower lash line I just
pretty much use the same eyeshadow
that I used on my lid and now I'm going
back in with Lala lavish and I'm using
this on my inner corners and dragging it
along my lower lashline as well I'm
going to take this heavy metal glitter
by urban decay this is in the shade amp
and I'm just applying some of this right
in the inner corners and then I'm
curling my lashes and applying tons and
tons of mascara for lips I use the
morphe cream lip polish in the shade
blush and my lips were so dry this day
I'm so sorry please ignore that and then
I use the flower Beauty lip lacquer in
pink about me on top that completes this
video thank you guys so much for

video bye
