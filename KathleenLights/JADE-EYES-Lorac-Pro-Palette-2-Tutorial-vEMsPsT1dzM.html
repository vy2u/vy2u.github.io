since I filmed in this position if you
have been a subscriber to my channel
since the very beginning then you might
recognize the angle limit but for my new
subscribers who actually don't know
what's going on they're like what the
heck what happened to your setup what's
going on I am actually facing my mirror
like facing the light bulb so they could
eliminate my face normally when I film
when you guys see me film in this setup
I am facing it that way I'm facing the
window but since it is nighttime I am
facing the mirror and the lights light
me up I haven't filmed a video at
nighttime in over six months because I
didn't have my desk with me in Miami so
I'm really excited throughout a film
whenever I won't if anyway today's video
is going to be a makeup tutorial and
it's finally the makeup look I was
wearing in my Little Rock Pro palette 2
review it was requested a ton and now's
when I was finally able to sit down and
film it for you guys it's basically a
really sultry emerald green look it's
actually really really simple there's no
crazy like outer-v work or anything to
like insane it's actually pretty simple
but the outcome looks nice and sultry
and appropriate for nighttime so if you
want to see how to get this look then
just keep on watching okay so I'm going
to start out by priming my eyelids I am
using my Urban Decay primer potion and
I'm mainly focusing this underneath my
brow bone then I'm going to take any
lorac Pro palette - and I'm going to go
into the color light brown and I'm going
to apply this in my crease I'm doing
this first because I want the other
colors to blend nicely so this is going
to be our transition shade
I'm going to take this Jordana crayon
this is in the color endless emerald and
I'm going to use this as a base for the
eyeshadow I'm putting down I'm going to
take my finger and just blend it up
towards my crease
I'm not going to take a brush and just
blend out the harsh edges of that crayon
we just put down
then I take this color and the palette
is called Jade it's a beautiful forest
green color and on a Mac 239 I believe
this what it is it's just a flat shader
brush I'm going to start packing this on
my entire lid
then with a Mac 217 and no eye shadow on
it I am just going to blend out that
green eyeshadow I'm going to go back
into the light brown color and I'm going
to continue to buff this into my crease
I'm just blending out that green eye
shadow some more making sure everything
looks nice and blended then I'm going to
go back into the green and pack some
more on the lid just in case a lot of it
was brushed away from all the blending
and then again with a 217 and no
additional product I'm just blending it
out I'm taking a wipe here and just I'm
cleaning up any of the fallout and then
I'm going to do a little sharp edge I'm
going to take this light cream color in
the palette and I'm going to apply this
right underneath my brow bone with a big
fluffy brush then I'm going to take the
color beige that beige and then I'm
going to apply this right underneath my
brow bone as well
I'm also playing this color in my inner
tear-duct to move on the rest of my face
really quickly I am taking my hard candy
sheer envy primer and applying this to
my face and then I am taking my
covergirl three and one outlast stay
fabulous foundation this is in the shade
medium beige and I am using a real
techniques sponge to apply this and I
keep looking to the side because I was
watching a video on YouTube story of my
leg I'm going to take my Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade 15 bear this
is like my favorite concealer of all
time I use it all the time it's great
and I'm gonna apply this underneath my
eyes to highlight and then on my nose in
between my eyebrows and around my mouth
I'm just blending it out with a real
techniques contour brush
I'm going to set all the concealer with
my MSF natural in the shade medium this
is going to tone down the under eye
concealer are applied because it is a
little bit too light for me now since
I'm a little bit more tan so this is
just going to mute it down a little bit
and set the concealer so it does
increase
I'm going to finish off my eyes really
quick I am taking my Maybelline master
drama eyeliner and use this all the time
you guys must be sick of it but it's my
favorite eyeliner and I am using this to
tight line and I'm going to apply this
to my waterline as well then I'm going
to take my favorite color in the palette
this is mocha and I'm going to run this
underneath my lower lash line just take
your time with this and blend it all out
I'm taking it from the outer corner all
the way to the inner corner and it's
going to give a nice look to the eyes
then I'm going to take my Jordana fabula
nur and I'm just going to stamp this all
the way across I'm not going to do a
wing I just want a really thin black
line then I'm going to apply a thin coat
of mascara to my top and bottom lashes
and then I'm going to apply some falsies
with my house of lashes glue and I'm
using these Iquitos in BFF they're just
really really natural falsies if you're
wondering what mascara that was it was
the Elizabeth Mott
it's so big mascara by the way I am
taking my Physicians Formula bronze
booster and I'm just bronzing up my face
when I did this look in my lorac Pro
palette 2 review I did a pom blusher
highlight it literally just bronze up my
face a lot with this product so that's
why I'm doing it again and then I
realized I wasn't wearing hearings
throughout this entire video so yeah I'm
just bronzing up my face let's finish
off the look I am using my Rimmel show
off lip lacquer in nude Eclipse and then
that completes this makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it it was really
simple but not simple at the same time I
really hope you liked it please
subscribe if you haven't already and
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
