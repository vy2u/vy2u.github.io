my monthly boxycharm bucks a charm
unboxing this is the june box and it's
July so I'm really really sorry that I'm
getting this video up so late I did
receive it in June but with everything
that has been going on and haven't been
able to sit down and film this video it
is closed I have not opened it so you
can see like it's closed I haven't
opened it the anticipation is killing me
because I hear the June box was a really
really good one but I haven't been able
to sit down and film this video because
you know stuff has been happening but I
thought better late than never
maybe I hope so so yeah I'm gonna film
it anyway um for those of you who are
interested in seeing this box even
though it's July if you guys don't know
what boxycharm
is I kind of went into more details in
like my last boxycharm unboxing this is
a monthly subscription service that is a
little bit new to me I have only unboxed
this one other time besides today I
think it was the May box and it was
amazing if you don't know what boxycharm
is it is a monthly subscription service
kind of like if see where you get beauty
products only this box is $21 a month
but honestly considering what I got last
month it was well worth the $21 I really
like boxycharm so so let's crack lack of
it's open market let's open this
so with boxycharm every month is a
different theme I believe the May box
was like a Mother's Day themed box and
everybody gets the same exact box you
know with Ipsy everybody gets kind of
like different things with boxycharm
everybody gets the same box which I
actually prefer okay so this month
the theme is Bridal beauty and you know
how I usually toss these cards in my
video but actually keep this one because
on the back of this card it tells you
everything that you got with like a
little description of how to use it and
it tells you the price which I really
like because you guys know I love to
tell you the prices of everything that's
inside of the box just so we could see
if it's worth the money or not so I love
that it tells you that oh yeah you got
another little thing thingy and then
this this is oh this is cool get a card
in your box that gives you 20% off your
purchase from Tarte comm which is
awesome the code is boxycharm 14 and
you're able to get 20% off through July
18 I will write the code down below so
you guys can get 20% off at start you
also get a little card here that says
save a dollar on any Revlon mascara oh
yeah I like it
you look coupon okay so the first thing
I see here is a Revlon mascara which is
probably why you got the coupon to save
a dollar off any Revlon mascara this is
the bold lacquer by grown luscious and
I've tried the original robustus mascara
and I wouldn't fan of it I mean I tried
it like in high school I don't really
remember but this is what it looks like
I'm pretty sure this is like the new
gold lacquer one and of course this is a
full-size product and it retails for
$7.99 so that's awesome you can never
have too many mascaras right right oh by
the way if you guys really really like
me trying on my FC products at the end
of my Ipsy bag videos I'm thinking of
doing that with the boxy charm videos so
I will be trying on any of the makeup
products at the end of this video so
stay tuned if you want to see this
mascara works next thing in the box I
see is this little um
nail polish duo and it is called strange
beautiful I'm guessing the brand is
called strange beautiful and it comes
with a really pretty champagne gold
color and a beautiful baby blue these
are actually really beautiful colors the
packaging reminds me a lot of the julep
Julie I don't know those julep nail
polishes let's see yeah they are really
really gorgeous colors the gold one is
called new gold girl and the blue one is
called something blue oh my god this is
so beautiful and I'm pretty sure these
full-sized maybe I'm not let's check the
cards it tells you yes the strange
beautiful nail lacquers are full-size
and they retail for $18 the duo is $18
so that's a really good deal that you
get that in this box because $18 is a
lowest basin and next thing in here is
really exciting
it is the tart cheek stain which I'm
guessing is why we got a 20% off start
thing you know like yeah it is a tart
cheek stain and this one is in the color
blushing bride so let's see I have heard
really good things about these
tart cheek stains and actually don't own
any of them this is what the color looks
like let me swatch it oh wow this is
actually a really really gorgeous color
I don't know if you can tell but it has
like a glow to it like it's a pink but
it's a very glowy pink it's not shimmery
there are no shimmers no glitter in this
product but it gives you like that glowy
look oh my god it's really really
gorgeous and this is obviously a
full-sized products and these retail for
$30 this little guy is 30 bucks which is
amazing because that is more than what
you paid for your boxycharm and then the
last two things are from the same brand
I think yeah this is 8 Corina
terena Tarantino I dream hyper liner I'm
guessing the brand is Tarina Tarantino
I've actually never heard of this brand
which I love getting brands that I've
never heard of in these boxes so this is
the eye liner and I'm guessing it is a
blue eyeliner yes it is blue it is
called cute robot that's the color and
this is the swatch on my hand it's a
very deep navy blue which is nice I love
blue eyeliner and it was really really
really creamy I don't know the lasting
power on his day because it's so so
creamy it might not last a whole lot but
I like that it's creamy so it doesn't
tug at my eyes so that's nice and the
this is a full-sized product and this
tails for $15 and then the last thing is
this Torino Tarantino I dream hyper
light that was a hyper liner and this is
a hyper light so this is gorgeous
packaging this looks really really fancy
this is like an eye highlighter I'm
guessing yeah this is basically like
those Mack highlighters they have one in
light boost and radiant rose I think
it's what it's called
this one is like the radiant rose color
because it is a pink tone so after you
twist this about a million times the
product comes out it is in tans this is
the color I said it's one of those pink
colors which is great to highlight
underneath the eyes and it's very thick
but in a good way I don't know it's not
like too watery or milky no no I think I
might like this we'll see I'm crazy
about this packaging though this
packaging is like fans say this is
another full-size product and this
retails for $22 okay so that was
everything I got in my boxycharm this
month this box was amazing we got one
two three four five five products in our
boxycharm and they were all full size
which is great because I know a lot of
people's issues with these monthly
subscriptions is that you get samples in
the mail but boxycharm kind of gives you
like 90% full size products most of the
time so it's great that everything in
this box this month was full size and
the total value for the bag this month
was 93 dollars and since everything was
full-size it is literally 93 dollars in
your box which is crazy considering you
only paid $21 so definitely check out
boxycharm if you haven't already because
i think i'm not going to lie it's
probably the best subscription service I
have come across for the money and you
get really good stuff I mean there's a
there's a full sized Tarte product in
here it's crazy I really really really
really loved this box I thought it was
great so if you want to see some of this
some of these products in action you
know what to do okay so I actually don't
have any blush on so I'm going to try
the Tarte blushing bride cheek stain and
I don't do well with cream blushes so
I'm a little furred I'm a little afraid
I'm just gonna tap it on it's just gonna
do that and then I'll I'll mix it in I'm
just going to take my makeup geek face
buffer brush just kind of blend that in
so this is the Tarte blush I really
really buffed it in because I know I
don't like really really like crazy
blush on my cheeks but I'm sure you can
build up with a color the color seems to
be very very buildable and you can just
build it up but I really really like it
even though I'm not a huge fan of pink
blushes there is like a glow factor
about this and even though it is a
Korean product it is really really easy
to blend okay so I'm a big idiot and I
should have put this on before I put on
the blush but whatever will look past
that I'm going to try out the Terina
Tarantino hyper light I dream hyper
light under eye brightener yeah
I know it says under eye brightener but
it is like a thicker cream but it is
really really easy to blend and you can
already tell like it just brightens a
lot okay so I took off my eye makeup
just because I had some winged eyeliner
on and we wouldn't be able to see the
full effect of the bow lacquer bye grow
luscious mascara so this is what I'm
going to try out right now
I should have curled my lashes before I
did this
okay so these are my lashes with two
coats of this stuff there would put
there two heavy coats by the way as you
can see compared to my lashes with no
mascara this mascara is actually really
really good I am so impressed
it is a mascara with the fiber kind of
bristles which I prefer over rubber
wands I really like it I like it a lot
it is a drier type of formula which I
actually do prefer as well just in case
you're wondering and yeah this stuff is
really good I'm going to go ahead and do
this I and I'll be right back I'm gonna
try out the terena Tarantino idream
hyper light hyper liner in cute robot
just type it on my waterline okay so it
goes on really really creamy and
pigmented it's so creamy that it doesn't
tug on your waterline which I really do
like I don't know about lasting power or
smudging or anything like that so I
can't exactly tell you that but it does
say that it's waterproof I didn't notice
that before but it does say that it's
waterproof so I mean it went on pretty
pretty pigmented which is really nice so
so far I'm liking this and the color is
really pretty it's like a dark dark blue
but you know it's different I like it
okay so now I'm going to go ahead and
try out these strange beautiful nail
polishes I'm actually going to go ahead
and do my nails since they're really
gross right now and then I'm going to
come back and show you guys what it
looks like
I had to chop my nails short because
this one got cut really really low so I
had to chop them all off so I'm going to
go ahead and you can't see me what
you're doing so I'm going to go ahead
and try this out and I'll be right back
kit now okay so I just came back from
painting my nails and I'm obsessed with
this I did all my nails blue and then
the accent nail I did it the nice pretty
champagne color and right now I have
like 12 year old boy nails because I had
to cut them really really short I hate
my nails this short but the formula was
really nice so yeah
loving this nail polish I thought it was
really really good so overall I think
boxycharm is fantastic I will leave a
