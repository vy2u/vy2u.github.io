can correct a contour to contour with
you is it edges it outline something
same final answer yeah no you're a huge
good with those over a truck you are a
bronzer you put on the skin to tan your
face to give you a bronze looks the face
and a contour is kind of like a cooler
after your powder not so much like
bronzy okay and you apply that's like
the hollows of the cheeks to make your
face look slimmer to contour the hollows
right here now see right
and it kind of contours your face sada
okay it's very hot at the Marbella all

YouTube channel I'll make the rules what
comes first concealer or powder Oh
your problem is you're really you set
your concealer with powder so I can stay
in place all day cleanup will conceal on
you and then paw drafted know so when
you cover is it right you cover it with
concealer and then you like powder fix
to set it in place illusion what does
concealer look what like a creamy
liquidy things like the same color your
skin tone it's not the powder you know
liquidy so your challenge I bet wrong
