alright now my hair is like a mess but I
barely have makeup on I'm actually gonna
be going to have a dentist appointment
at 3 and it is currently 2 o'clock and I
have like massive anxiety I am terrified
of the dentist like even for just a
regular cleaning I'm like huh I'm
sitting down and I'm filming my January
boxycharm unboxing and I'm really
excited the sneak peeks online looked
really promising
I cut myself on a bracelet today like I
was messing with a bracelet and that
sucker cut me and now I have a band-aid
on anyway let's just jump right into
this you're probably watching this when
I'm already in LA I will be going to LA
for IMATS and I'm staying there for a
few days like five days but anyway let's
get into this bad boy okay so the theme
for the box this month is celebrate in
style kind of like for the new year it
says choose the new year okay so the
first thing I see is this kind of this
little thing right here that says tarts
20% off coupon so you can go on tart
calm and get 20% off your order using
the code box e jam valid through
February 12 so that's really good and
the first thing I see immediately is
huge and I'm so excited okay okay this
is in our box this is from Tarte which
is a high-end brand so that Sephora and
Ulta it's very very well not very
high-end not like lyocell but it's like
high-end is a full-size tarte maracuja
bronzing bronzing bronzing serum this
retails for 47 dollars that is double
your box more than double so this is the
I thought this was just the America's
oil but this is the maracuja bronzing
serum oh my gosh
oh my good this is what it looks like
well I'm very excited for this all my
emotions I'm very excited it says
hydrate and even skin tone to help fight
signs of aging for firmer brighter
appearance the gradual self tanning
complex delivers instant radiance as it
naturally bronzes for a health for a
healthy glowing complexion dispense two
to three drops of the serum in your
hands and apply to clean dry skin on the
face so this is just like the America
huge oil and like a little bit of a
bronzing bronze eNOS all-in-one let me
shake this I feel like I need to shake
it but why do I feel that way I don't
know this is like a gradual tan they
like tending things that you could use
on your face oh my god it doesn't feel
greasy at all it sinks right into the
skin now that is exciting the next oh my
god I've tried this brand it's actually
a pretty good brand the next product is
from the brand Beauty for real and it is
the perfect pencil lip enhancer lip
pencil so this is like a lip liner and
this is full-size this retails for $14
not to test it on animals beauty's for
real it's one of those wooden lip liners
which aren't my favorite but it's not at
least it's not drawing on my hand this
is a really pretty color very on-trend
right now with that whole like 90 is
what I'm actually kind of in a hurry
from the dentist appointment so I'm
gonna try this bad boy on right now oh
my god my mirror I don't know if it's
because I just had a lip balm on but
this isn't drying my lips at all you
like my face
I really like that a lot it doesn't see
a name it just says like the perfect
pencil so I guess this brand has this as
like their perfect lip liner okay so the
next thing is from Mirabella and we've
gotten this brand in our box before I
believe this says oh it's a primer this
says Mirabella face primer this is a
full-sized product and it's $29 this is
like pretty small for a full set Oh cute
okay just says face primer mom I'm
intrigued oh it does have that silicone
II feel it's very silicone II which is
great okay good it doesn't have a scent
so it says infuse your skin with vitamin
E while minimizing the appearance of
large pores and fine lines with a silky
base primer know this this have vitamin
E that's really cool okay so this is so
cool I'm actually really excited that I
we got this these are flash tattoos
it says pur Lisse pur Lisse say I don't
I don't know how to say that pur Lisse
skin sparkle flash tattoos this is one
sheet and this thing retails for $26 for
one sheet which is crazy I know these
things are pricey but des des Spence um
this is what they look like this fan day
just pissing me off
they're so pretty the only like them so
much if I wasn't on my way to the
dentist I would put them on for you guys
but I'll definitely wear these and
you'll see them like in upcoming videos
that's amazing I've actually haven't
seen any like subscription box have like
flash tattoos so that is really cool
okay and then the last thing is another
thing from the brand Beauty for real and
this is the bit for real true color lip
cream in always there
that's the shade always there this is
full-size and this retails for $22 so
this Stefanie is like a high-end
this is the lip cream I have one of
these in red that I love this in the
shade o ways there I've already said
that these things are cool because they
have like the mirror and the little
light like Gerard cosmetics II asked
let's put the Sun this goes really nice
oh my son is gone this goes nicely on
top of that oh my son is back this is
the color right here I really like this
like I said I have a red one that I
really like I like that there's a mirror
I mean it's cute I really like these
little things so yes I'm happy about
this cuz I like this color a lot it's
very what I'm into right now but I
definitely will try this out and let you
guys know if I like this primer and this
of course as well and I definitely be
wearing these in upcoming videos cuz I
love them so I just did the math and the
overall value of this box is 138 dollars
I really don't know how these people
make money I do not understand because
you pay twenty one dollars and the value
this month was 138 this alone was almost
50 bucks
that is ridiculous is my favorite
subscription service I mean I only have
like two so but still this is the one
that I feel like you get your money's
worth more than any of them this is such
an exciting box just with this alone I'm
so excited I don't think there's
anything bad in the box this month um oh
I'm so excited for this month I can't
wait to try this I just want to put this
on my vanity ah yeah I give this month
especially this month a big a plus plus
I'm very excited thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
