my Beck's
Sherman bags I don't know what to say
right now I feel like I always have
something to tell you right before we
get into the box but I don't today
except the echo stuff here and my room
is still a mess and I'm drinking
Pellegrino which I prefer Perry air more
than Pellegrino but it didn't have it at
Publix yesterday
not the us'd that's not Heineken for
anybody who thought I was drinking beer
all right well let's just get into this
January box shall we so this is what the
box looks like only inside this month
was the cod oh it fell I didn't see that
happen yet so the car says eyes on 2016
so like I said this what the box looks
like and the first thing I'm gonna grab
is this because I'm already excited just
by looking at this when I open the box
right now like I'm already excited this
is a brush set and it says revolution
boxycharm I set so I'm assuming it's
like a collaboration with boxycharm and
it's from the brand royal and langnickel
which I really really love this brand
they make my holy grail eyebrow brush
and I got that one at Michaels and I'm
pretty sure that's not like a makeup
brush it's just like a artist brush it
says royal and langnickel brush set
full-size obviously and each individual
brush does retail for $7.99 but this kit
is $23 how puffy is my hair today on a
scale of 1 to Hermione no I think it's
more than Hermione
I think we've passed the Hermione the
Hermione in the first movie we're at the
Hagrid stage at this point so it comes
with three brushes let me take them out
and this is what they look like they're
so beautiful I didn't think they were
gonna feel this nice this has the same
material as NARS packaging you know like
that rubber that's what these feel like
they feel so luxurious I really like it
already this really long one is called
the bee x90 and it is their crease brush
but it's like very long to be a crease
brush it's a little bit stiff I don't
know about this one but I like this
maybe for like the inner corners or
something we'll see then this one is
a pencil brush and this is the BX 95
it's described as a smudger brush but
this would be perfecto and it doesn't
hurt either it's nice it's nice for
underneath the eyes that's amazing and
then this last one is the BX 80 and it's
the detail brush which is essentially
just an all-over eye shadow brush I'm
definitely going to be using this
because it's just a standard eyeshadow
brush and who doesn't like regular
eyeshadow brushes okay so next thing in
the Box is this guy right here in a
summery day this is the star looks luxe
long wear eyeliner pen this is full-size
and this is a $19 I'm assuming this is
like a felt tip or like a brush let's
see let's open it oh yeah okay so this
is a felt tip oh my gosh look how black
that is this is extremely black I don't
know if you guys can tell it's very very
black and I'm going to leave this on my
hand to see if like at the end of the
video
it's like smudge proof or something okay
so this bad boy jumped at me right now
of course and this is really really
exciting so this is the revealed smoky
palette from Coastal Scents trying to
open this this product like take this
clear thing off kind of like a nice and
gentle woman but I'm about to take my
faith to this right now and I don't have
a scissor in here oh I got it I think
yeah so like I said this is the revealed
smoky palette by um I was gonna say girl
in decay by Coastal Scents and they
pretty much just like totes copied the
Urban Decay smoky palette it even it's
even spelled just like the way the Urban
Decay smells it though this is what it
looks like on the inside immediately off
the bat this bottom row right here looks
incredibly similar to the Urban Decay
Naked a smoky palette for some reason I
love calling it naked smoky because it
always spell smokey like with an E and
this is just SM okay-y to me this is
smokey don't make it smoky pad so I'm
going to just watch a couple all that
Brown is actually super pigmented
this color is so beautiful it's like a
navy blue let me see how it swatches Oh
bad I mean it's a little bit it's not so
pigmented but it's not bad let's try out
the shimmery shades oh this one is
beautiful look at that
that's this shade right here can you see
can you see this gold one right here is
really really really smooth yeah that
one has really nice pigmentation right
there overall I've always felt that
these revealed palette by Coastal Scents
have been hit and miss with the shades
inside but for the price you cannot go
wrong with these this retails for 3995
but Coastal Scents always has their
revealed palettes for like $19 on their
website but this is really exciting to
get because it's an entire eyeshadow
palette and with a little bit fix+ you
can work with anything alright there's
one more thing in the books it's that
guy right there so I already knew based
on like sneak peeks and all that stuff
that this was going to be in this
month's box this is the blink mascara
amplified like from the brand blink and
this is actually mascara I'm wearing on
my eyes not this exact one but I went to
like a boxycharm lunch their
headquarters are like here in South
Florida and since I live here in South
Florida you know I love me the people
that boxycharm
but I went to a lunch with them and they
gave out goodie bags to everybody and
this was in the goodie bag so I already
own this so I'm not gonna open this one
because I'm gonna give it to my friend
but um it's a mascara wearing right now
and this is really cool because this is
a tubing mascara I'm not sure if blink
was like the first brand to come out
with the tubing thing I want to say
that's what I heard but it's really
really cool now the formula now in terms
of what it does to my lashes I don't
notice like a crazy amount of volume
this definitely 100% is not my favorite
mascara but it is still really good and
the best thing about it is the formula
like you take a washcloth and warm water
it has to be warm I wouldn't suggest
cold water because I feel like the warm
water need the warm water helps break
down the formula so we just put some
warm water on a little
cotton pad and then you just gently rub
the mascara off and it comes off in
little tubes like tiny little tubes you
don't have raccoon eyes there's not
black things smudged all over your eyes
it's a great great great formula and
this retails for $26 so that's a spent
so that's not a cheap mascara that's a
good formula I like it so that completes
this video the retail value of this box
was over $100 and you paid $21 still
amazes me every single time I will leave
the boxycharm website down below in case
you want to subscribe to this monthly
subscription service and actually let me
look through my email they gave me a
coupon code I put it in a picture on
Instagram last month but let me see I
have a code that's valid until the end
of this month so January 30 31st it's
not valid anymore and the code is boxy
kathleenlights I will have the code down
below you get five percent off your
first subscription so that doesn't seem
like much but if you do like the three
month subscription or you sign up for
like the six month subscription and the
five percent off does help but still
it's something I mean it's better than
nothing so I will leave that code down
below just in case you're interested I
really like these brushes and they just
feel so nice oh let's check the mmm I'm
rubbing this starlooks
eyeliner oh my gosh Wow it's still there
and like all the eyeshadow roped-off
