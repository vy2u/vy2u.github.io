my boxy Sherman Blackson so there's a
couple of things I want to mention
before I get into this video this
morning when I woke up I had a giant
pimple right here like humongous and
then when I went to do my makeup today
like nothing was covering so simple and
then I remembered the Devi trick what I
think it was desi Perkins I'm not sure
if I start from her or lustre look I
think it was busy I think I remember her
once mentioning that she put eyeliner or
something on top of her pimples to
create like a mole or a birthmark you
know like a little something that way it
looks like a birthmark and not a pimple
so that's what I did I created a little
birthmark right there where my pimple is
which I think he didn't tell me and
you've never seen me before you would
think I had a birthmark or a mole there
because it's in a very convincing spot I
feel like Mary Kay has a birthmark right
there as well I have had so much coffee
today
but seriously I'm going to use this
trick for melon so let's open the bar
ready the car says and the charm award
goes to I'm assuming like old retro
Hollywood glam is the theme this month
and then this is what it looks like
let's tackle this big data here this the
first thing we all saw this is the Oscar
blondie pronto dry shampoo spray I think
I used to have it a couple years ago but
I don't remember if I liked it or not
what's wrong with my voice I think I'm
always losing my voice or my little like
a raspy voice is coming back I don't
know when I was in middle school and
elementary school I had a really raspy
voice all the kids used to tell me that
I found it like an old man and it went
away for a while but maybe that's coming
back anyway I'm two unto all over the
place today so as a lot of you know my
favorite dry shampoo in the entire world
is the Elizabeth and James Nirvana black
but that is a very pricey dry shampoo
and I'm always I'm going on the hunt for
something good let me try this in my
hair is Grace Lee again a little bit of
a web cast and nothing too crazy like my
Nirvana black gives a major white cast
on the hair like you rarely have to work
it in this was smells lemony okay okay I
totally think that did a good job of
sucking up my oils up there and I feel
like it gave me some ba-ba-boom in my
hair too
okay so I am pleasantly surprised
like that did a really good job I like
the scent and I feel like it really did
make my hair feel less greasy so this is
a full-size product and this is $23 it's
not exactly the cheapest dry shampoo out
there but it's more affordable than the
Nirvana one I'm definitely going to be
using this puppy more often if I should
be crazy how this product cost more than
what you paid for the box isn't that
insane okay so the next thing in the Box
is this guy right here this is the pure
cheek stain in the shade peach Bellini
it's a blush tint and brush duo let's
see where's the bush ah the receipts
okay on one side you get the cream but
whoa that's intense you get the cream up
blush and then you just blend it out
with the brush I'm actually going to try
this on my face right now okay so it's
not super intense when you swatch it it
looks like red but when you swatch it
it's more muted I don't typically love
cream blush I mean I'm sure you guys
know I don't really use that on my
channel book let's dive right in every
time I look in the marriage there's a
booger on top of my head but I'm like oh
knowing it's not water okay so I just
twisted it up and now I'm just gonna I
don't know if I should apply it to my
hand first
and that's let me try that like that and
then I'm going to pick it up with the
brush and apply it that way I feel like
this brush might be too small for this
but I definitely see the color building
while actually think that looks really
really pretty you guys know I'm not huge
on like very pigmented blushes so I only
put a little bit but you could totally
build this up and get like really
intense cheeks okay so I actually really
like this I do have to say that I think
the next time I use this I won't use it
with this brush I just the brush is good
I just think it was a little bit too
small this blush is so beautiful it
looks intimidating at first but I think
you can get this a pretty poorly peachy
blush I love it I think it's going to be
really pretty for spring and summer and
I don't know I really like it and I
gotta be honest I didn't think I was
going to like it
this is a full-size product and miss
retails for $26 okay so the next thing
in the Box is this guy like this is an
illuminating face highlighter set it
says vintage by Jessica leader skin
I believe that vintage might be the name
of the brand I'm not sure I've never
heard of this brand before this is what
the palette looks like it's like a matte
white and that has two highlights inside
a more pinky shade any more like topi
opal golden shades I hope they got maybe
too dark for me so let me just watch
them oh they swatch really really pretty
can you tell probably not there's
actually really cool because they're two
very large highlights and you get a
mirror in here this is a full-size
products and mist retails for $35
chocolate diamond and rose quartz are
the names of the highlights I'm actually
going to just grab this highlighting
brush that's in the box and use it for
this this is a fan brush by the brand
crown brushes sauce fan brush SS 0 1 7
and this retails for $12.99 so I'm going
to take the brush I'm going to dip it
into the pinky shade
going to apply a little bit more this
fan brush is a little bit too thin for
me I really like this highlight but I
was going to be too dark but it's not so
deep and I'm going to put some on my
nose this fan brush is actually perfect
to highlight the nose because it's like
thin enough to go right down the bridge
I would go over it with this golden
color but I just know it's going to be a
little bit too dark for me I could use
this as my inner corner highlight let's
just see a really pretty golden shade
okay so I was totally impressed by that
highlight I think it's so so pretty okay
and I mean last thing we have in this
box is this guy right here this is the
ultra suede matte top coat by the brand
a desk I love anything that has to do
with nails oh my gosh almost home and
that's glass okay glad that didn't fall
so this is just a matte top coat
I love matte top coat I'm actually
working on the matte top coat for Caleb
polish just rain so I actually have no
nail polish on I opened the box for the
first time earlier this morning to see
more or less what kind of makeup I was
supposed to put on to see what I was
going to try on and I had taken off my
nail polish last night and I just added
a clear top coat so when I open the box
and I thought there was a matte top but
I was like oh my gosh
I should have just left my nail polish
on I could have shown you how matte this
got but rarely do I ever come across a
matte top coat I don't like the only one
I never really liked was the one from
NYC I found it didn't really keep my
nails matte for that long so I'm sure
this is good stuff it is a full sized
product and it retails for $18 okay so
that was everything that was in my buck
she shared this month I actually really
liked this month because I have low
expectations for certain things and they
ended up proving me wrong like I didn't
think I was going to love this dry
shampoo but my hair feels nice I really
like this super impressed with this
blush that I have on I think it's so
beautiful the only thing that was like
it's okay is this fan verse I don't know
I think it was a pretty good boss I
really really enjoyed it so I
math and the overall value this month
was 114 dollars let me know what you got
in your box this month did you hate it
did you love it what was your favorite
thing what was your least favorite thing
let's talk about it in the comments
below so yeah that can wait this video I
hope you guys enjoyed it thank you guys
