my boxy sure my boxes please excuse my
hair I just put it in a bun because it
is super knotted and I cannot brush it
right now
I just can't oh and also look at this
look at this my dark circles are insane
right now people still say on fleek
because if they still do my dark circles
are on fleek like well no that wouldn't
make sense fleek is a good thing my eye
bags on the opposite of fleek I couldn't
sleep last night it was just one of
those nights I just couldn't sleep so I
looked Lacey this morning just letting
you know I'm all sorts of crazy today so
this month but she sure looks like at
this it says rocks 2018 I cannot believe
it's 2008 teen people born in the year
2000 are officially adults what anyway
that's the theme rock on so this is what
the box looks like this month and when I
opened it earlier I got really excited
for a few things that I saw I actually
already own three out of the five
products in this box which is pretty
cool cuz there are things I really like
but anyway let's get started
so the first thing in the books is this
it's definitely not the first thing I
saw but it's the first thing I'm gonna
put on because mama needs her eyebrows
on guys know how I feel about not having
my eyebrows on if I have my eyebrows on
I feel like I can conquer the world no
matter what even though I don't have
anything else on my face you know
everybody has that thing mine is
eyebrows but anyway this is the it
cosmetics brow power Universal brow
pencil in the shade Universal taupe this
is kind of like a universal shade that
everyone can use the more pressure you
apply the darker it looks on your brows
so if you are belong just apply a very
light pressure but if you have black
hair I'm not exactly sure if this is
dark enough but I feel like anybody from
blonde hair to dark brown could wear
this alright so I'm gonna
my brows on
okay so my brows are officially on I
already feel like more of a human being
isn't that crazy
I don't know I really love that brow
pencil I find that it lasts a really
long time and I feel like it's so easy
to use I really really like that brow
pencil a plus totally I mean I've been
using it for a super Wow for a long time
next thing in the box is this little
blue tube this is the dr. Brandt
Luminizer primer I actually own this and
I really like it I've spoken about this
in a monthly favorites video there's
something about this primer that I can't
really explain I even said that in my
favorites video it kind of feels like a
face moisturizer mixed in with a silicon
primer but just a little bit it doesn't
really feel silicone II and I really
like it it has a little bit of a shimmer
in it but it's barely noticeable and
there's just something about this that
makes foundation just look nice when you
apply it on top it just makes your
foundation apply so smoothly and so
nicely so I really enjoy this I'm gonna
use my viewfinder as my mirror I don't
know why I just opened this one and used
it on my face I should have totally used
the one I own Wow nice move Kathleen
nice move when I first tried this primer
out I was like I don't like it it's not
hydrating enough but I like how smooth
it makes my skin if you have very very
dry skin I would just recommend putting
a moisturizer underneath and then going
in with this primer so yeah I'm not sure
if you can tell but it gives you just a
barely-there glow and mainly just a nice
base for makeup so I'm gonna go ahead
and apply my foundation and all that
good stuff and we'll be back to test out
the rest ok I'm back so I just put on
some foundation some concealer some
powder and I also put on my contour
because there is like a bronzer blush
and highlighting trio in here that I
want to try out but the bronzer is like
a very warm and shimmery so I wanted to
contour a bit just to have that base
down but before we go into that I'm
gonna try out this eyeshadow palette
right here that I have been dying to try
oh my gosh I haven't told you the prices
of anything so the it cosmetics brow
power is $24 and then this of course is
also full size and this retails for $38
okay now this is from crown brushes
and this is the glam metals poly I
didn't even know they did eyeshadow I
thought they just did brushes and this
is what it looks like on the inside it's
actually a pretty cool palette the
mirror is a guitar this is like my dad's
kind of power like my dad would love
this palette if he liked to makeup he
would like this palette it reminds me of
him and this comes with eight shimmery
shades and then one matte charcoal like
grey black so you would kind of use this
palette in conjunction with something
else maybe if you have like a fully
matte palette those two would make like
the perfect little combo but I'm gonna
go ahead and try out some of these
shadows on my eyes I don't know what I
want to do I think I want to use a wild
thing
all over my entire lid that's like a
burgundy shade Wow
thank the tendon for my crease I always
put on a matte crease color before I go
in with anything on my lid and I'm gonna
be using my Tarte man-eater palette I'm
gonna be using this color and pur as my
crease shade by the way I don't know if
you can tell on my face before I go in
with the eyeshadows i'm using my
Physicians Formula the healthy
foundation I'm mixing these two because
I feel like I can't find my shade but
I'm mixing these two and I really like
how it looks it's very natural but I
feel like it's a primer is what makes it
look even prettier there's something
about that primer that just makes your
foundation glide on and just look so
nicely
or maybe it's just me but that's how I
feel anyway
let's begin
oh right so things got a little bit
vampy with my eyes but I really like how
they turned out so a couple things I
really like this shade wild thing it was
so pigmented it went on really really
nicely this isn't a palette I would ever
use on its own I had to go in to another
palette to finish a look and I didn't do
my brow bone or my inner corners because
there was nothing in this palette for
that this is a nice add-on palette to
keep in your collection the only thing I
really don't like is this mirror I tried
to use it but you can't even see in your
face because it's the shape of a guitar
and it's really small this is a full
size palette of course and this retails
for $25 so it's nice that you get it in
the box
considering the box is 21 bucks next up
we have this guy this is from the brand
pur this is the dreamer bronzed and
brightened cheek palette this is a
full-size product and this retails for
$34 you get a blush a highlight and a
bronzer this is a very timid a bronzer
this is a more of an eye shadow this
would actually look beautiful as an eye
shadow wow that pigmentation is really
nice oh wow that is super super
pigmented I'm gonna use a very light
hand they feel almost creamy to the
touch like literally they feel their
powders but they feel extremely creamy
okay so I'm gonna take a little bit of
the shade mineral glow I'm very nervous
if you guys see that oh well I totally
see it on camera but in person it's not
showing up that much oh my gosh that
scared me
I totally applied too much on this side
that's the bronzer now I'm gonna take
the blush which this looks so pigment I
mean this is all really pigmented but
this is crazy
oh my gosh I actually really like this
blush do you see that I'm not sure if
you can see that on camera let me add a
little bit more it's so pretty
I like this blush a lot
it's a blush with a beautiful Sheen but
there's no glitter in it so it looks so
nice cuz it's honestly just a glowy
blush and then lastly I'm gonna dip into
the highlight Wow you have to be very
careful because it is so pigmented but
oh my gosh I love this highlight it's so
beautiful but it doesn't look chunky
it just looks straight-up glowy it has
such a nice Sheen oh my god y'all owe me
oh my god
okay okay so right off the bat I will
say this is a winner for me except the
bronzer I don't like the bronzer I feel
like when I applied too much it just
looks a little bit muddy on camera I
don't really like it and I know myself I
will not reach for this but I really
like this highlight a lot and I really
liked this blush I'm gonna keep this on
my vanity and I'm gonna play around with
these more because it was really
impressed by these base no and I'm not
even gonna zoom out there's no point
because there's only one product length
and it is something I freakin love
something I already know I love I'm so
excited that we got a girl lactic matte
lip paint in the box this is one of my
favorite liquid lipsticks they're
extremely comfortable on the lips they
don't dry out your lips yet they last on
the lips all freakin day I love it and
this is one of my favorite shades
actually this one is called posh and I'm
actually gonna go grab my posh that's
smarter
okay so this is Posche it drives down
completely but it feels so comfortable
it's crazy I love girl lactic lip paints
but yeah that was everything I got in
this month's bucks hisham oh this is
full-size and this retails for $23 so I
did the math and the overall value of
this box was 144 dollars that's crazy
that's actually like a lot more than
usual this was a major hit major hit
major hit these three products were the
standout products for me amazing brands
just these three or worth it for me the
only thing that I was like was the
eyeshadow palette I mean it's nice I got
a nice look but it's not my go-to it's
not my favorite and I really liked these
two shades a lot but this was a dud for
me so this is kind of like a actually I
liked more than I disliked so I would
consider this a win as well but yeah
