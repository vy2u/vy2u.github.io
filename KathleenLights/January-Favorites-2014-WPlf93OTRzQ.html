January favorites and okay I'm just
gonna say it really quickly cuz I know
you guys hate it when I say it but my
lighting sucks it does see my head there
see my little shadow that really bothers
me and it's just so frustrating because
in my other setup my lighting wasn't bad
but good news I'm buying light and um so
hopefully my lighting situation won't be
as frustrating and they hate me every
time I talk about my lighting but I just
quickly wanted them into that but
seriously it has been raining every
single day here so it's it's hard it's
hard but anyway I wanted to go ahead and
jump into the video a lot of you guys
might appreciate that the drugstore was
really good to me this month I have
discovered some nice little things at
the drugstore I'm not gonna lie so my
first favorite is a foundation that it
is the Rimmel stay matte foundation I
did a whole review and demo on this
foundation I actually really really love
it I'm wearing it right now and I like
it for some reason I've been really
enjoying this kind of foundation like
the Moosey texture I just really really
love it it's light weight it's not cakey
on my skin and you think it would be
since I have dry skin and it's a matte
foundation but it's not cakey it's
really nice the only thing is that I
really have to pair it with my
Maybelline Baby skin instant pore eraser
because I do feel like this sinks into
pores because of the texture of the
foundation and a tendency of sinking
into pores so I really really love it
with the baby skin actually yeah this is
the only way I wear this foundation is
with this primer so I have been loving
this little duo I don't know if this is
a dupe for the professional since I've
never tried the pore fessional but I
really really like it it does do a good
job of blurring my pores I actually
really really really love this and I
like the feeling it leaves on my skin
since I have dry skin I feel like it
just it smooths out the texture of my
skin if that makes any sense I don't
know so yeah basically I'm obsessed with
this little combination it has been my
foundation routine since I bought this
sucker oh and did I mention this is
$4.99 that's a steal guys that's a steal
so my next favorite is a high-end
product and it is the NARS Laguna
and okay this isn't cheap this is eight
36-38 I want to say 36 this is a pretty
pricey bronzer and I never wanted to
purchase it because it was so expensive
so I waited till like NARS was 20% off
on their website one day and then I
purchased it and I'm so glad I did in my
opinion is probably my favorite bronzer
that I've ever owned
ever I'm not saying a lot since I love
bronzers but I cannot explain how I feel
about this brother there's something
about the color of this bronzer that
makes it really unique it does have like
gold shimmers in it but it's not it's
not shimmery I don't know how to explain
it I just love the way it looks on my
skin I actually use this on my friend
America last week and she was like what
bronzer did you use my face I looked
nice and tan and I was like NARS Laguna
it's good so I do think it's worth the
price I will repurchase it when I hit
pan because someone tells me I'm gonna
hit pan on this bad boy
very soon since this is literally the
only bronzer I have been using since I
bought it
it is the bronzer I'm wearing on my face
right now and I'm just completely
completely obsessed with it I like it I
like it a lot my next two favorites are
lip products and they are both from the
drugstore I have been obsessed with the
revlon colorburst matte balms
I love every single one that I own I use
them all the time but I have been loving
this one the most this one is in the
color standout and I love red lipstick
it's probably my favorite kind of lip to
rock I just think it's so classy and
feminine and I have been using this red
lip over my Ruby whoo
which is saying a lot because Ruby woo
is literally my favorite lipstick of all
time and since I bought this one I have
been using this one
non-stop this is also the color I'm
wearing on my lips today I have it over
cherry and lip liner from Mac but this
has been my go-to red lip and I just had
to mention it because it's been my go to
her lip and then when it comes to a nude
lip
this has been my goal too as well unless
I'm doing a bold lip
usually I have nude lipstick on and this
has been my absolute favorite this is
called the blushing beige from
Maybelline Maybelline came out with a
whole line of new nude lipsticks new
nude lipsticks and it's amazing because
it fits every single skin tone so no
matter what skin tone you have you're
gonna find a lipstick for you in that
collection but this one is blushing
beige and it is my favorite from the
whole collection I bought two and I
prefer this one a lot more I just think
it's literally my perfect nude lip I
don't need to combine this with anything
else I don't even feel like I need a
gloss on top of it the only thing I will
say is that I'm not a fan of the way
Maybelline lipstick smell I mean it's
nothing too terrible because once I put
it on my lips I don't smell it anymore
but that's that's the only downside of
this perfect amazing little beauty can
we just talk about the cat on the Lady
Bird palette oh that was upside down and
I didn't realize it well mini heart
attack I am obsessed with this palette
everything about this palette is
fantastic it comes with a tight shadows
and they're all matte eyeshadows which
is amazing to me since palettes tend to
lack matte eyeshadows most of the time
and I love that it's not just strictly
neutrals I mean you have your neutral
colors of course but then you have like
this really pretty navy blue a purple
okay a bright orange which by the way is
my favorite eyeshadow in this palette it
is to die for
I love it and I have just been noticing
that I have been grabbing this palette a
lot lately no matter what I look I do I
usually grab this use it for a
transition color or a pop of color or
something that I have just been using
this palette a lot so I do think it's
amazing and it's not that expensive
considering you're getting so many
eyeshadows you guys know my obsession
for highlighters
I love glowy skin and this has been my
favorite highlighter this month this is
from Physicians Formula it is the
shimmer strips this one in particular is
called Miami strip and it is just so
beautiful I can't even contain my
excitement when I talk about this it
goes from a really nice chocolatey
bronze all the way to like a very very
light pinky kind of color and on the
back of this thing it says custom
bronzer blush and eye shadow personally
I think it's way too shimmery for a bra
and not even dark enough per browser and
I mean you could use it as a blush but
it's a little too shimmery like that too
but you could use these as individual
eyeshadows or you could do what I do and
I use it as a highlight even though each
individual strip is nice there's
something about it when you just mix it
all together it gives you the most
beautiful radiant glow I can't even
describe it it is the highlight I'm
wearing on my face right now
I love that it doesn't have chunks of
glitter in it I hate chunky highlighters
and this one is just this is probably my
favorite drugstore highlighter that I've
ever used ever in the history of ever my
last two favorites of the month aren't
makeup related but I really wanted to
share them with you since I have been
obsessed with them and the first one is
this
Nivea body wash this is the touch of
sparkle moisturizing body wash it
moisturizes and illuminates it says it
illuminates because it has diamond
powder in it which to be honest I don't
feel illuminated after I use this body
wash but I really do love it
I mean I could totally tell that there's
diamond powder in it because once you
put it on your skin it has like an
iridescent to it like this liquid looks
like a pearly iridescent glow kind of
body wash I don't know it's really weird
you're gonna have to see it because I
probably have not describing that
correctly but I just want to talk about
this really quickly because I have been
so obsessed with it this smells so
incredible
it says the scent is white calla blossom
scent which I had never smelled this
scent before but it's good just give
this a chance guys okay I think might up
at Walmart and I swear my skin feels so
moisturized after I use this not only is
a site good but it really hydrates the
crap out of my skin I give this an A+
I'm not usually one to like rave about
body washes but this is a good one and
my last favorite is something that I'm
so excited to talk about because I feel
like it has changed my skin and it is
the doctor sponge this is a tiny little
cognac sponge they used to wash your
face and I'm sure you guys have seen
this before because bosha has one that's
really similar it's like white they said
that
fora and that one is like $25 and these
little doctor sponge ones are just 815 I
think either I know that they're under
$9 I'm pretty sure they're 850 and this
is incredible when you first buy this it
is a hard tiny little rock and then you
put it underwater and it starts to
soften up and it gets into this
fluffiness - wet because I used it this
morning when I washed my face and I
promise you I feel like this has made a
difference in my skin my skin issue
isn't so much acne as it is texture I
have the strangest driest weirdest
texture to my skin a lot of foundations
don't look good on my skin because I
have this like bumpy texture that goes
on on my forehead and on my cheeks and
this has improved that dramatically
because as you are washing your face you
are also gently exfoliating which it's
not good to exfoliate your face every
day but this is so incredibly gentle
that you don't feel like your face is
being exfoliated it doesn't feel gritty
at all I can't explain the texture at
this point but it is made out of that
cognac material like I said bozo sells
one at Sephora but these are really
really inexpensive and you can get them
online at doctor sponge comm this
specific one is the green tea sponge
they have a variety of different sponges
on their website depending on your skin
type I got the green tea sponge because
it is for dry skin they have one for
sensitive skin one for oily skin one for
aging skin they have so many different
sponges and they're just under nine
dollars so I think it is definitely
worth a try
definitely check out that website
because this has made an incredible
difference I do eventually want to do an
updated skin care routine because this
is definitely a permanent product in my
skincare routine so yeah those were my
Beauty favorites for the month of
January another favorite that was in
beauty I'm just gonna mention it really
quick and it's the show arrow I am
obsessed with that show if you guys
watch arrow which by the way I'm all
caught up I know that seems ridiculous
since last video I posted two days ago I
was not even halfway done with season 1
but I'm all caught up now how pathetic
is that it is a great great show like
great great great great great great show
amazing definitely watch it season 1 is
on Netflix so yeah I hope you like this
