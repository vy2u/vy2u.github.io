my January favorites I don't have a lot
of soft soft I don't really have a lot
of stuff to talk about
um this month oddly enough but I feel
really gothic I was just like playing
around with the makeup today before I
started filming and then this happened I
it's intense I know okay so the first
thing I want to talk about is actually
my lip color but not specifically my lip
color just a brand of lipstick are the
NYX matte lipsticks I discovered these
really early on in the month and I
purchased a bunch of them the first one
I ever purchased was this one right here
called spirit and it's such a really
pretty like everyday color I used it a
bunch of times throughout the month and
I loved the formula so much that I went
and bought like five more of these matte
lipsticks I get mine at Ulta calm they
do have a matte alta and I think I've
seen some at Target but I just ordered
them online and they're actually really
really good they're really inexpensive
and they feel nice on the lips they
don't settle into my lines and they are
a nice matte formula but they aren't
drying I don't know I like them a lot so
I really have been loving this one which
is the one I'm wearing on my lips I'm
into brown lipstick that's just my thing
right now is really dark brown lipstick
so that's this one it's called Mason
it's a nice nice dark dark vampy color
and then of course spirit and then I
really also love this one in Euro trash
that name is so weird
but it's a nice deeper neutral color I
really really love them like I said what
I like most about these are the formula
I am very intimate lips these days like
hard core okay so my next favorite is
something I didn't think I would love as
much as I do and it is the Anastasia
contour kit and Nastasia Anastasia
I say Anastasia so at first I didn't
think I was going to like it at all
because I was like I'm not going to get
use out of most of these shades I'm only
gonna use like one or two colors but no
I use actually quite a quite a few
a few colors I use this one to contour
this is fawn and it is the color I have
on today to contour my cheeks and then
after I contour
sometimes I'll take this one right here
called Java and I'll just dust a little
bit around my temples and just give a
little bit of warmth the only color that
I really don't use at all is this one
because it's too dark for my skin tone
but when I'm self-tanning I'm not
self-tanning right now but when I'm
self-tanning I can get away with it a
little bit but I love these two shades
this one is banana and I'm not sure what
this one's called
but I like to set my under eye concealer
with this and then go over it with this
color because I don't like like too
yellow I don't like products that are
too yellow under my eyes so I always go
over it with this one and I find that
this really brightens my under eye area
a lot so the only color that I really
despised and this was the color that was
right here I took it out was supposed to
be like a highlight shade but it barely
had any shimmer it was like a really
dull like highlight shade I didn't like
it at all for my cheekbones I like
something a little bit more intense to
highlight so I actually popped it out
and then popped in a makeup forever eye
shadow one of their artists eye shadows
the makeup ever eyeshadows are a little
bit bigger than this so I had to like
squish it in there I had to like force
it in there but I did that because I
really liked this color too hot to
highlight this is a makeup forever eye
shadow like I just said but I actually
really like this color on my cheekbones
cuz it's super intense so I just popped
it in here and this is my little contour
kit I took this with me to California
and this is the only thing I used on my
cheeks to contour to bronze a little bit
and to highlight my cheeks like this is
the only thing I used this is the
original one now they have a bunch of
different colors you can customize your
own and they're refillable so you can
pop these out if you hit pan and buy
some more so I really really love this a
lot more than I thought I would
okay so surprisingly enough I have been
using this little trio from ELF a lot
this month this is like their new eye
pretty sure this is new actually
to me with like three other ones and you
guys know how much I love their baked
eyeshadows I have purchased all of them
and now they have like baked trios which
is so cool
so I love this one the most this is in
the shade Brown bonanza I love it I used
this gold color all over my lid a lot
and then I just put the darker Brown
like a little bit in the outer V and it
makes a whole look
I do need like a matte crease color and
a highlight shade not stuff but these
two eyeshadows are beautiful and so
pigmented they're gorgeous I love really
golden eye looks and I actually really
love this trio in Brown bonanza it's
beautiful
okay so my go-to lip liner this month
was Mac's etc lip liner this is their
pro long wear lip pencil these are my
favorite lip liners ever it reminds me a
lot of my Too Faced perfect lip liner
which is my favorite lip liner the
prolong my lip liners okay how many
times can I say lip liner the problem
where lip pencils are the best at Mac I
really love their original to like their
normal lip pencils but they're Pro
Longwear ones are amazing because they
do not budge and they're so creamy that
they don't skip on your lid on your lips
and I love this shade it's a really
really warm neutral like peachy Brown
you know like an everyday lip liner or
this almost every day when I was in
California and it's just the best I wore
it like crazy this month I wore
yesterday it's like it's good stuff it's
starting to look a little dingy I've
like sharpened in a million times ready
because I cannot put this down so it is
a very matte finish and whenever I want
this color but I want it to be a little
bit glossy I put on this lipstick
covergirl came out with a bunch of new
lipsticks I don't even know what they're
called but this one is my favorite
actually have another one a pink one
that I don't really like that much it's
okay but this one is beautiful this
isn't 255 tempting toffee I love this
lip combo it's like the most beautiful
peachy Brown lip combo ever actually had
this lip come on in that New Year's Eve
makeup tutorial that I did
with the blue eyes and like the gold
eyeliner this is the lip combo I was
wearing and I loved it
okay and then my last beauty favorite is
actually something that I want to
mention because I have been using it a
lot this month a lot in combination with
this but I have been using my wet and
wild vanity palette like crazy I got
this like a year and a half ago and I
bought it on Amazon because this was
discontinued like a while ago
and I don't know why because it's
honestly like the best drugstore eye
palette in the history of the world like
the best palette I have ever ever come
across and I wanted to mention it just
in case you guys see this on Amazon or
Ebay definitely pick it up I paid like
ten dollars for it it wasn't that price
when it was being sold but I paid like
ten dollars for it because it's so so
good these this color right here these
two colors are amazing matte colors they
aren't talking at all they're beautiful
and this bronzy shade right here I mean
every color in this palette is
absolutely wonderful
the only color that they sell
individually now is this one right here
and it's called brulee they sell it
under regular like $1 eyes shadows but
seriously if you see vanity somewhere
online I seriously recommend picking it
up I have been using this brown like in
my crease like every day this month
I just recently picked it up again it's
been sitting in my makeup collection I
haven't touched it but recently it's
been my goal to okay and then two more
products that aren't beauty related this
is the dr. teals pure Epsom salt foaming
bath this is a soothe and sleep with
lavender lavender is like one of my
all-time favorite sentences you guys
already know I've said that about a
million times
but this is like the best bubble bath I
have ever used ever it gets really
really like soapy and bubbly in the
shower and it smells amazing like
lavender and Epsom salt it has like that
minty really like feel like spa-like
scent
oh it's smells like it's powerful in my
nose but it really does relax you like I
put this in my bathtub and I just lay
back and it's like the mint enos and the
lavender just it puts me in a nice
relaxing mood
this was so cheap I think this cost like
$7 at Ulta I ordered a non Ulta calm so
inexpensive and it's like a huge tub
it's really big
I highly recommend it if you're into
like epsom salt and lavender put this in
your bath you will not be disappointed
and then my last favorite is really
really exciting so okay I like stock
Jaclyn hill like I've mentioned her in
my like past five videos kind of
embarrassing but I like stock Jaclyn
hill and I was watching her December
favorites I believe it was and she was
talking about this brand this is the
blissful body she was actually talking
about this I believe this is the
blissful body luxury skincare made by
hand body butter and she was talking
about how it's the best body butter in
the history of the world and I was like
wow I really get need to get my hands on
that and then like a couple of weeks
later this was in my pedal box the woman
has an Etsy shop I will link wha the
woman has an Etsy shop her name is Casey
or Cassie I'm not sure because I can't
pronounce anything I will link her Etsy
shop down below but I guess she watched
my videos and she liked my videos that
she sent me these in my peel box and I
was like oh my god wait a minute this is
the stuff that Jack O'Neill was raving
about so I was really excited to try
this guy's Jack and he'll was not
kidding this body butter is real it's
like intense it's thick it's so so
hydrating but it's like I know if you
could tell it's so thick it doesn't even
feel like liquidy at all it's home at
home and this is in the like scent a
butter cream amazing but I have to say
that the standout product for me is this
guy right here this is the blissful body
hand and body lotion in lemon
buttercream lemon is like my favorite
scent ever ever and it's so good this
obviously is in a body butter it's more
like a lotion so it's a little bit less
hydrating but I love it like for
everyday I have been like rubbing my
hands in this every single day like
every 10 minutes I'm like putting lemon
butter cream all up you smell like a
real pet like this smells like real not
artificial at all like like nothing fake
I swear it's like a rub
whole lemon loaf all over my body in a
not disgusting way so these products are
super hydrating I would definitely leave
her information down below so you can
check our heredity shop I'm actually
gonna be filming a video about my
favorite XE shops soon because I have
been like Etsy crazy recently and I have
been discovering really amazing like
little businesses so I want to do a
video dedicated to like nice Etsy shops

standout products for me this month I

mention I will be doing a drugstore haul

buying a lot of high-end makeup and

drugstore haul just to keep it even on
