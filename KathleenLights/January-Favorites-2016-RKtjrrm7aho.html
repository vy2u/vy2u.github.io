here so Jonas come here hey guys so
today's video is going to be my January
favorites a home Mike he is so jealous
Porter that is Cornelius's spa he is the
one who sits on my vanity not you so in
today's video I'm going to be sharing
with you all the products I've been
really really loving this month so let's
start so the first thing I want to talk
about is actually these pallets right
here this is a makeup forever palette I
bought two of them on the Sephora
website I don't know what they're called
they're just magnetic pallets from Make
Up For Ever I actually stumbled across
these one day when I was trying to buy a
Z palette on Sephora and then I saw
these and I noticed not only was it
bigger than the really large Z palette
it was cheaper which is crazy the only
difference is this one doesn't have like
a see-through top like the Z palette one
does so that totally sucks but it's
cheaper and it's bigger and I love it
this is what it looks like on the inside
it's just a 10 palette but it holds so
many shadows I'm not exactly sure how
many eyeshadows the really large Z
palette carries but I know that this one
holds a lot more if you're wondering
what's in this palette I just threw a
bunch of like really soft colors that's
a mix of Mac makeup geek Anastacio and
morphe but oh my gosh I highly highly
recommend these little tin palettes I
honestly like them better than Z
palettes because they're bigger and
cheaper the only thing is I wish that it
had like an opening so I can see what's
inside but they're amazing and if you
are wondering if you guys own any artist
eyeshadows from Make Up For Ever they're
really really big and sometimes you
can't fit a lot of them in a Z palette I
actually have this one full of all of my
artist eyeshadows and you can see like
it fits a lot of them I really truly
love these palettes
my next favorite I've only been using
them for like about two weeks but I have
to talk
about them and it is these guys right
here these are the new wet and wild
one-step wonder gel nail polishes oh my
gosh these are way better than I thought
they were going to be I did have high
hopes for them because I do like the
mega last nail polishes from Wet n Wild
but these are amazing and I believe
these are around $3 they're very very
very inexpensive okay this makes my nail
polish stay on forever
I purchased a bunch of these like two
weeks ago and I've worn these two nail
polishes and they have both lasted like
an entire week I was wearing condensed
milk last week and it's a really pretty
light light like bone color oh it's
beautiful this one I do for sure have to
put on two coats because the first coat
is really patchy but once you put on the
second coat it's really nice and really
opaque and then the one I'm wearing on
my nails right now I paint in my nails
like five days ago and it's still going
strong and it is the shade stay classy I
highly highly highly recommend these
nail polishes if you're looking for a
nail polish that is gonna last longer on
your nails and is really inexpensive
everybody's nails are different for
example people swear by Essie nail
polishes and while I love the colors
they chip incredibly fast on me these
lasts forever and they so shape I love
it
okay so if you follow me on snapchat or
any of my social media platforms you
know there's like dog hair flying ever
follow me on social media you've already
seen me rave about this but I had to
mention it again I did an entire video
on this product so I'm going to go to
in-depth here there's something in my
eye
but this is the RCM a no color powder
and this is the best powder I have ever
used
I've raved about it already I'm gonna
link the video where I show you how to
use it down below in the description box
I love this do not get confused with the
RCM a translucent powder this is the no
color powder they are different powders
this is the best one make sure that if
you are going to purchase this you get
the no color powder this just sets my
face so beautifully and I have very very
dry skin it's really hard to find a
powder for people like me it's really
hard
this does the job and more it just never
looks cakey you can bake with this there
is no flashback there's no white cast it
just makes your skin look beautiful
without adding any color or anything
it's not white even though it is white
you got me it's amazing any skin tone
can put this on their skin and you won't
see it I know that it is sold out now um
but once it is back in stock I'm going
to try to link it down below I will also
update you guys on social media when it
is back in stock on Beauty lish or any
other website so I'll let you know and
also this is $10 so I highly recommend
you picking it up because it is so
affordable it's a drugstore price and
it's 20 times better than my high-end
powders amazing another product I raved
about on snapchat is this right here I'm
so excited to be talking about this I
love this so freakin much so I walked
into Sephora one day and I was just in
the Mallee section Sephora no Ulta they
don't sell melia at Sephora I walked
into Ulta and I was in the Mallee
section and I don't know much about
malli since I don't really hear many
people talking about it but I saw this
on display and when i swatched that
highlight this is a highlighting and
blush duo when i swatch this highlight I
nearly fell I nearly fell from the
Beauty this is the prettiest golden
highlight I have ever seen in my life so
this is the Mallee effortless airbrush
duo and this one is in the shade peach
they also have one called pretty and
pink I believe that has the same
highlight but it has a much darker blush
like it's a very very very pink like a
hot pink blush that would never look
good on my skin tone maybe with a light
hand but I'm not into super intense
blushes so I went with the peach one
instead and I'm really glad I did
because it is the most beautiful peach
blush ever I love it this is a little
spensive that's expensive it is
I paid $45 for this but it comes with a
blush a highlight and a double-ended
brush that is pretty good I don't know
where mine is I don't know if I
accidentally threw it away I don't know
but anyway it's so good and I think it's
really really worth the money something
about this highlight that stands out for
me it's really similar and it's the same
texture as Mac whisper of guilt
Mac oh darling Lauren
they're gilded honey what else so
Hollywood by anastacio it's that same
kind of highlight that same golden
highlight but I find that this one's
better than any of the other ones I've
used this is the highlight I'm wearing
on my face right now and it is my you
demise I love it so much
and I'm also wearing this blush on my
cheeks today I love this I love it
another highlight that I actually really
love and I wanted to mention in this
video is this one from a brand called
makeup revolution
I bought mine online after seeing some
reviews on their liquid lipsticks or
some eyeshadow palettes and I was
intrigued by the highlights because they
looked really pretty and they really are
and these are so inexpensive I love they
have a bunch of different highlights
this one is called radiant lights it is
more on the like pinky side as opposed
to this one this one has like that
whitish pink sheen which I really really
love in a highlight i highly recommend
you guys check out makeup revolute
makeup revolution it's a website that I
recently discovered and I purchased some
things and they're so affordable like
really inexpensive stuff there's no like
glitter in it and like you get a
beautiful glow from within it's not
chunky it feels high-end and it's very
very very affordable so I wanted to give
it a shout out because I love this
highlight so the palette I have been
loving loving since I got it is the Too
Faced bonbon palette chocolate bonbon
palette excuse me this is their newest
release to like the chocolate bar series
they came out with the original
chocolate bar which is my all-time
favorite palette hands-down and then
they came out with the chocolate
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette I
purchased that one and I didn't like it
for some reason I found that there it
wasn't as pigmented and it didn't live
up to the original chocolate bar so I
returned it and then when this one came
out I didn't have any high hopes I was
like oh that's gonna be another
semi-sweet but no it's so good this is
what it looks like on the inside I
really love that they're hearts instead
of little squares it's cute and girly it
smells like cocoa and I really really
like the eyeshadows in this palette my
gosh what is in my eye is gonna fall
it's gonna be there all day it's gonna
be the only I'm wearing these eyeshadows
on my eyes right now I have a mixture
between almond truffle and
Bokke in my crease and then I have satin
sheets in my inner corners right here
this is an insanely beautiful eyeshadow
and I love that it's big like it's the
bigger one because I always find myself
reaching for this one no matter what I
shadow look I do this one is well I have
this as my eyes my brow bone highlight
right here and then I have Bordeaux on
my lower lash line the prettiest color
in this palette I think and then I have
dark truffle on my lower lash line as
well and then my all-over lid shade is
this one right here called molasses chip
it's a gorgeous bronzy shade so that is
what's on my eyes right now just
straight-up chocolate bonbons and I
really like the packaging I like it I
love it so much I've been using a
non-stop I want to talk about a bronzer
that I've been using all month and it is
this one by Kiko and it is their
flawless fusion bronzer and I have mine
in the shade 0-3 cinnamon I believe it's
called cinnamon and this is what it
looks like if you haven't heard of the
brand Kiko it is a really really really
affordable brand and I think it was like
uk-based but now you can get it in the
States
I purchased a lot of my Kiko items off
of their website and some Kiko stuff was
actually sent to me a little bit after I
did that haul but I love this bronzer
and it's so funny because I was watching
if you watched Totti glam life group I
was talking about how she didn't like
this bronzer and I was like oh my gosh
why I love that was I just think it's so
funny how things will work for someone
it won't work for someone else so keep
that in mind if you buy this it didn't
work for her but I really love it it's
the bronzer I'm wearing right now what I
love the most about it is the color it
is very very warm which I find makes me
look a little bit Tanner than I am
I haven't solved 10 my body in months
I'm talking like five months more five
months five months and I'm naturally a
really really fair person so I just find
that this makes me look a little bit
tanner a little bit bronzer it is matte
but I love the undertone and I find that
it's really easy to blend for me so I
really like Kiko because it's really
inexpensive and I just really loved this
bronzer they do have different colors
too but I have mine in 0-3 so now I want
to talk about a product that I didn't
think I was gonna
like I didn't even like it at first I
tweeted about how it was all right but
it wasn't my favorite and now I'm
obsessed that happens to me all the time
my friend gabby is always telling me
that like I hate things before I love
them I don't know why I am like that but
I am this is the Anastasia brow definer
if you are familiar with Anastacio I've
been using her brow Wiz since it was in
like reddish purple packaging like back
in the day before I started my youtube
channel that is all I used on my brows
as the brow Wiz in brunette it was my
favorite now it's called dark brown but
honest hacia sent me three of their
brows of Finers chocolate and then like
two other darker colors and then I loved
it so much that I ended up going on the
website on Sephora and buying soft brown
because that's the one I felt would have
matched me more but oddly enough I still
keep using chocolate even though I think
it might be too dark for me it's on my
eyebrows right now anyway so it comes
with a spoolie on one side as the brow
Wiz does as well and then on the other
side you have this like angled tip it's
so strange it's a little bit fatter a
little bit chunkier and it's at an
angled it has like a slant to it with
this brow definer I do my eyebrows in
like 5.5 seconds with the brow is it--
it's a lot skinnier so I take a little
bit longer I just find that I'm like ooh
boom done this thing in my eyes right
her nose
you need a haircut the brow Wiz is
amazing but it is a lot smaller so I do
take up a lot of time doing my brows
with this it's so fast with that being
said I think that if you have naturally
very thin brows or very like if you
don't have a lot of hairs like on your
brows I think the brow is is your best
bet but if you have naturally thick
brows which I don't but I do like to
make them a little bit bold and thick if
you like the whole thick brow bold brow
look then go for the brow definer but if
you like a more natural brow then go for
the brow is both amazing I love them
both I want to give a quick shout out to
this bronzer right here this is the
Milani baked bronzer in
shade Soleil they do have two shades I
like this one more because the other
baked bronzer Milani has is a little bit
more pink this one is a little bit more
golden like I said earlier I have been
extremely fair these days and I like my
skin to look a little bit bronzer and
warmer and this bronzer is beautiful I
know I'm gonna get so much use out of
this in the summertime you sleepy it
does have a sheen to it there's like a
golden veining throughout it that gives
you like a really Jennifer Lopez
sunkissed look to the skin Milani has
great face products I feel and I just
love this bronzer I do have a little bit
of this dust all over my face like I
literally went ham with this and just
like put it everywhere and I just find
it gives a nice golden glow a little a
little bit of warmth I just I really
love it I've been using it a lot I have
a concealer favorite and I feel like a
lot of people have been talking about
this concealer but for a really good
reason these are the new Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD concealers they came out
with the new Ultra HD foundation so they
had to come out with Ultra HD concealer
I guess and these are so good they have
two different undertones they have the
ones that begin with our like our 22 or
40 or 30 whatever and then they have the
ones that begin with why like why 20 why
23 why 40 whatever here you get me the
ones that have the are the R stands for
like red and the Y stands for yellow
come on Marnie Leah's you look we're
just sitting there so while the Y is
strictly for concealing the ours are for
like correcting like blue under-eye
circles and all those things I do use
these in conjunction first I will put
down our 22 this is a peachy concealer I
put very little of this right underneath
my eyes and I find that it does
counteract like the blues or the
darkness in my under eye circles I
really really love this in r22 love it
and then I'll go on top of it with y23
which is a more yellowy concealer and I
love the mixture of the two I just find
that it hides my dark circles but it
conceals and highlights at
same time I love the consistency of this
you would think because it's in a little
squeezy tube like this that it would be
really really thick and ke but it's not
it has really good coverage but it's
very very thin in consistency I'm not
sure you do have to set this though this
does crease concealers crease
some of them crease more than others
this isn't like super Creasy or anything
but you do have to set it to make sure
it does increase just in case you were
wondering but I really really love these
I think they're worth the hype for sure
a mascara that blew my mind
this is the Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara
it's another Kiko product this is around
$14 it reminds me so much of the Too
Faced better than sex mascara it's
insane
so it comes in this packaging that's
really similar to like the new Marc
Jacobs packaging and then the wand has
like an hourglass shape which i think is
really similar to the two-faced one this
gives me so much volume like so much
volume inside mascara I'm wearing on my
eyes right now and stay lying when they
call this a voluminous mascara I find
that it keeps a curl and it just makes
my eyelashes look like I have a million
of them I don't know and it's super
thick this can get clumpy really quickly
this can get a little clumpy so keep
that in mind but I like a little bit
more of a clumpy or mascara because it
gives me like a lot of thickness and I
just I love this I think it's amazing
okay so I have a lip product to share
with you guys and I'm not gonna lie I've
been wearing Aquarius in Taurus like all
month from colour-pop because I mean
I've just been wearing the moment but I
have been obsessed with his lip gloss I
have been using it so freakin much this
is the buxom lip gloss in the shade rose
julep this is their full-on lip cream
excuse me but some full-on lip cream in
Rose julep these if you've been watching
my channel for a long time my favorite
gloss of all time is white
rushon by buxom he's buxom lip glosses
are the best lip glosses I have ever
ever used they were in my 2014 favorites
of the year I love them I'm actually
wearing Rose julep right now over the
Aquarius lip liner I feel like this
makes your lips look so juicy I love the
scent they do have like a minty
sensation your lips feel cold when
you're wearing this but they don't sting
they don't burn I'm not sure if this is
supposed to be a plumping lip gloss
because it doesn't feel like it's
plumping at all like it doesn't hurt or
not even sting in the slightest but it's
minty so my lips feel a little bit
tingly and minty ish I don't know I love
these lip glosses they are hands down
the best I own like I own eight of them
and I've purchased all of them myself I
think they're amazing lip glosses but
I've been wearing Rose juleps so much
this one is one of my more recent
purchases from buxom and it's a really
pretty soft rosy shade and my favorite
way to wear this is just with mascara
like I just put on mascara and I pop
this on my lips and I look like
fresh-faced
I love this lip gloss and it layers
really well with other lip products okay
so two more products and then this video
is over I have to give a huge huge shout
out to the diva curl super cream coconut
curl styler I bought this when it was
the Sephora vib sale and it came with a
shampoo and conditioner and I haven't
even tried the shampoo and conditioner
yet but I love this I highly highly
highly recommend this if you have curly
hair and if you have like very puffy
curly hair obviously I don't have this
product in my hair right now this is my
like natural hair I didn't do jack to it
I just I haven't been bothered with my
hair I don't know if you guys can tell
but I just have not been bothered but
whenever I've been styling my hair curly
this has been making me want to wear my
hair curly more often it is a very very
thick cream it's a pump so you pump this
out on your hand and I do my entire head
with a pump and a half my entire
freaking hair it's very very thick it
smells like straight-up coconut so I
love the scent and it just makes my
curls look so bouncy and it's frizz free
it says 100% sulfate paraben and
silicone free amazing for those of you
with curly hair I highly recommend this
it just gives my curls so much life I
love it and then the last thing I want
to mention isn't beauty related but I
really wanted to talk about this okay
this is a candle and this is from a
brand called
our own Candle Company I have like seven
of these already and I purchased all of
them on Amazon I don't even know how I
discovered these I haven't heard anybody
talk about this
I was just on Amazon one day and I was
searching like random candles and I came
across a candle that was labeled smell
my nuts and I'm like smell my nuts what
is and I clicked on the candle and it
was a banana net scent candle it had
like banana hazelnut add a bunch of nuts
in it and it was called smell my nuts
and I was like I want to buy that and I
did and it's awesome and the name
intrigued me I was like I want to buy
that that's pretty funny so I bought it
and it's really good that it just made
me like buy a ton of them they vary in
price some of them cost me like nine
dollars some of them cost me like ten
eleven but they're generally pretty
inexpensive especially for how powerful
they are you can like this for like a
good 10 minutes and then turn it off
because it is that powerful
right here I'm holding fresh linen and I
haven't I just bought this one I haven't
used it yet that is that is just so
strong that it like takes my breath away
I love the scent of fresh linen but I
like really really strong camels because
I want you to be able to smell it the
second you walk into my house you know
like thoughts and what the whole room to
be full of the scent and these do that
I'm gonna try to find them and link them
below and I love that they are in little
mason jars I just think it's so cute so
yeah that completes this video these are
products I have been loving in the month
of January thank you guys so much for
