my January favorites I'm going to be
talking about all the products I was
loving in the month of January and also
somewhat December I didn't do any summer
favorites since I did my yearly
favorites so I've kind of been loving
some of these products for two months
not just one I first want to thank you
guys so much my birthday was a few days
ago I was born on the 27th in 1992 I am
officially 25 but I got an overwhelming
amount of love from you guys on my
birthday I just want to thank you so
much for all the happy birthday tweets
messages comments everything you guys
are the best I really really appreciate
it
you guys made me feel really loved and
that felt nice so I just wanted to say
thank you so much from the bottom of my
heart and my voice is a little off I
lost my voice my birthday was on Friday
and my friends came over and I was
screaming at the top of my lungs we were
playing flip Cup and I was just yelling
and I kind of lost my voice but it's
coming back let's talk about my favorite
so my first favorite I love so
incredibly much I feel like you need
this in your life this is a Milani make
it last setting spray this is the only
setting spray I've been using since I
bought it
I've used this much already and I feel
like this a lot considering I just got
it I did not wear makeup everyday but
whenever I have been putting on makeup I
have been setting it with this and I
love this it reminds me a lot of fix+
but better because it does such a good
job of setting your makeup down if
you're looking a little cakey or you're
looking a little powdering that tends to
happen to me a lot where I'll apply a
face powder and it'll just look like too
much I spray this all over my face and
it just makes my powder sink into the
skin every time I apply this I feel like
it looks like I'm not really wearing
that much foundation everything just
sinks in and looks so natural do I think
it makes my makeup last all day somewhat
I definitely have setting sprays that
last a little bit longer like my skin
Danai via one that one keeps my makeup
on all day this one claims to be 16 hour
wear but I don't think it makes your
makeup last 16 hours but it does prolong
my makeup I do have other setting sprays
that really lock in my makeup and make
them last hours and hours and hours and
hours this one doesn't quite do that for
me but it does enough and I just love
the finish it gives my face so my next
favorite is a primer this is the Beca
first light priming filter instant
complete
and refresh Becca has a primer that's
very similar to this but it's called
their backlight priming filter and it
has more of a golden champagne look to
it this one is a lilac purple and I have
to say I like this one better I don't
exactly know why it kind of brightens my
skin a little bit and it just makes it
look so dewy and so healthy I say it in
every video I know but just in case
they're new subscribers I have very dry
skin so I love a nice glowy primer and
this one gives me the glow while it
gives me the hydration because there's
so many primers on the market that just
looks shimmery and it gives you the
illusion that you're glowing but there
isn't much moisture to it they don't
feel very hydrating this one feels
hydrating and you look beautifully dewy
so I recently discovered an eyeshadow
palette that just knocked my freaking
socks off I love this this is from the
brand elf and it is their mad format to
palette now they have a master matte
palette that I've spoken about in the
past that's really nice
it has matte shadows but they're all
very neutral and wearable shades this
one has warm shades in it I gotta say I
love this one more than their original
matte format not only because of the
color selection because I gotta admit I
do like the colors and this one more but
because of the quality I feel like they
kind of upped their quality for this
palette it's creamier than their
original the original one is really good
don't get me wrong but this one I feel
blends even better I'm wearing these
shades on my eyes today this is the only
thing I have on my eyes besides an eye
liner I'm wearing the English L liner in
87 or something like that it's a brown
but everything else is this palette this
shade right here the second one has a
really pretty like pinky Brown look to
it that reminds me so much of my
favorite eyeshadow in my Too Faced
chocolate bar palette this is such an
affordable palette and I so think it's
worth it it is so beautiful love the
warm tone I wore the other day to my
birthday dinner with my family and I
love it I love it I'm all about this
palette it's so good okay so about a
month and a half ago I would say closer
to two months ago I think I was on the
Sephora website and I saw this product
and it really really intrigued me this
is the perricone mg no foundation
foundation serum totally different from
their no foundation foundation they have
two products I've never tried there no
foundation foundation but I didn't
really read that many positive reviews
about that one but when I was looking at
the
reviews on this guy I read a lot of
great stuff a lot of people really liked
it so I decided to try it out for myself
and I purchased it I purchased a big
bottle they have two sizes they have a
smaller size for $20 and then they have
this big bottle for 60 bucks which is
insane I know that's a lot of money for
our foundation but honestly it sounded
like a foundation I would truly truly
loved it has that serum a consistency
and it has SPF 30 is perfect for the
daytime I would say the coverage of this
is very buildable it's light coverage
but you can build it up to medium I
think you can even build it up to full
if the foundation I'm wearing on my face
right now and it just looks like skin
it's so beautiful and it's so easy to
blend the only thing well besides the
price but the major con like the major
problem I have with this is that this is
the only shade one we have one shade why
on earth would they only give you one
color and this color is a little bit too
dark for me I do have to bronze my neck
a little bit I hope that they come out
with other shades but it doesn't look
like that's going to happen you're
supposed to shake this up right before
you apply it and that's what I do and I
love it so much it comes in this little
dropper I just love it so much very
liquidy very beautiful one quick thing
I'm going to mention before I move on to
my next product this says it expires
February 2017 that's like right now
which I don't understand cuz I bought
this like a month and a half ago how is
this only like a three months thing what
I'm totally going to keep it past this
expiration date longer something smells
good and looks good I'm going to keep it
so on a daily basis I like the bare
minimum when it comes to makeup I just
like for my skin to breathe I really
love the no makeup makeup look during
the day I just I love minimal makeup and
the number seven radiant glow concealer
has been a favorite of mine this is the
most natural concealer ever it comes and
like this little clicker thing there are
days where I just like to brush this
underneath the eyes and then I kind of
put some on my forehead and on my face I
kind of use it as a foundation but not
really I use very little products but I
just blend it all over the place and it
looks like like it's not there it
doesn't really crease on me that much it
looks like skin it doesn't look cakey
underneath the eyes it looks like
nothing is there but it has a nice like
matte finish not like a drying matte but
like a perfectly natural matte I
wouldn't say it's full coverage but it
gives me enough to where I'm happy for
day to day I'll just put on some mascara
I'll fill in my eyebrows and I put this
on my face and I am good to go that's
usually what's been happening so for the
past two months I've been going back and
forth with my bronzers I've either been
using my Too Faced baked luminous glow
bronzer and sweet teas it's probably one
of my top five favorite bronzers in the
entire world or I have been using this
guy right here I've talked about that
toothpaste 1 million times but this one
is pretty new to me it's not a new
bronzer but like I said it's new to me
this isn't cover FX bronzer in the shade
suntan oh my gosh I'm obsessed with this
I love this bronzer because it is
literally a perfect contour powder but
then I could use it like on my entire
face and it doesn't look too cool tones
this I feel can do both it is a cool
tone bronzer but it's not great it looks
cooler than it is actually I have this
on my face today this is the only
bronzer on my face and I love it
chiseled the cheekbones perfectly while
making your skin was a little bit more
tan like you've been out of the Sun kind
of like a Sun Tan if you will so as you
know most of the time I don't really
like to set my entire face unless I have
like a khaki foundation underneath and
whenever I have been setting my face I
have been setting it with this guy I
love this this is a wet and wild photo
focus pressed powder in the shade warm
light I'm obsessed with this powder I
think it's so beautiful I think this
might be my favorite pressed powder from
the drugstore I really like the Milani
one I spoke about in my haul but that's
more of like a luminous face powder this
is just a face powder there's not any
sheen to it or anything like that but it
looks like nothing when you apply it to
your face like even when you swatch it I
feel like not much comes off onto your
fingers I mean you could totally see
that there's power there but it's very
lightweight and it feels so smooth and
so silky and it's best foundation
perfectly because it doesn't apply too
much product I can go in for hours and
it never looks too much but it still
sets my foundation down which I love
because sometimes I'm wearing a really
pretty luminous foundation and I don't
want the powder
to mattify it too much or ruin it or
look too heavy this this doesn't do that
this is perfect it reminds me a lot of
the Mac mineralized skinfinish natural
in the sense that it's very light and
beautiful and not cakey very
natural-looking I love it I definitely
think you should check it out okay so I
have three highlights to talk about
that's crazy I know but it's been two
months okay
this first one is brand new to my
collection the others I've had for a
while but this is the girl lactic
luminous face veil in the shade season
doesn't a newer highlight for girl
lactic and I love girl lactic highlights
they are very very good quality but this
one is different I don't know how I
explain okay so this is what it looks
like when I listed it in the pan for the
first time I thought oh that's just
going to be way too dark for my skin
tone but it's watch's lighter than it
looks in the pan this is the highlight
right there you don't really get much
color you just get like a beautiful
shine this is the highlight I'm wearing
on my face you doesn't know I like
really natural-looking highlights but
every once in a while I love busting out
a super metallic glossy look this looks
stunning in photos it's like my perfect
highlight for nighttime not for the
faint of heart
it's very intense and very bold but I
think it's very very beautiful this next
time I've been wearing more like on a
day-to-day basis a little bit more
frequently than the girl lactic one this
is the elf highlight in moonlight pearls
I never really used to love this one I
always thought it was okay but I never
loved it because it kind of felt like
every time i swatched it nothing was
coming off on my finger so a few weeks
ago I took this product here it's like a
little comb and I just scraped the
entire top layer of this like I got rid
of so much products on top which I know
is really insane because you're wasting
product by doing that but elf is very
affordable so I didn't feel like it was
hurting me that much and now that I did
that actually get way more use out of it
taking off the top layer totally
improved this highlight but like a
million percent I'm obsessed with it now
it looks so stunning and pearly on the
skin in a very natural way but it still
gives you that beautiful glow I love
this it gives you a beautiful beautiful
glow for only a few dollars I think this
is three bucks I mean you can't beat
that I have so been loving this one and
then this highlight
actually a highlight that I've raised
about about a hundred times but now they
sell it in a full-sized version this is
the NARS highlight in the shade hot sand
oh my gosh the other day as sweet is
like oh my gosh NARS created a hot sand
blush I don't know why I tweeted blush I
mean these are called blushes on the
Sephora website I believe so when I saw
that I guess like I just wrote blush by
mistake I was so excited when I saw it
because they sold this as a limited
edition duel with Laguna and I bought
like three backups of that duo thinking
it was limited edition and that one day
I wouldn't be able to get my hands on it
anymore
but I think they now made this color
permanent I love that they now have it
in a full-size version this is my
favorite highlight from NARS and one of
my favorite highlights in the world it
has a really soft pink undertone but on
the cheeks it looks like a peachy
champagne glowing beautiful beautiful
beautiful highlight nothing like NARS
albatross it's like full of glitter this
is a beautiful sheen to the skin and I
love it so much I'm so happy it's like
permanent okay so let's jump into the
lip products ourselves I want to give a
huge shout out to the Milani keep it
smooth lip treatment oh my gosh this
smells like my childhood every time I
smell this it takes me right back to
when I was younger I can't put my finger
on what this smells like
to me I think it I think it smells like
a lip smacker fun story I used to have
like a little fuzzy purse it was like a
blue fuzzy like backpack purse I had the
strings and I had that when I was like
12 years old so obviously I wasn't
keeping my keys or my phone and there
but I would take that everywhere I went
and it was full of lip smackers I had
like 30 lip smackers in my backpack at
all times I was obsessed with that brand
when I was younger and I had like all
the chap sticks all the lip gloss and
that is what this reminds me of I love
the scent it's the main reason why I
like it I'm not going to lie but I also
really really like the texture of this
product I've been using it as a liquid
lipstick base I think it wears so nice
underneath dry liquid lipsticks it's not
like an aqua for texture it's not like a
super thick hydrating balm it kind of
has like a more slippery texture and it
just wears so nicely underneath liquid
lipsticks I have a few that are just too
drying and they kind of
crack off and if I apply this first I
kind of eliminate that it makes the
liquid lipstick not so drying I really
have been loving this so recently I have
been really into coloured raine liquid
lipsticks I've always had a few in my
collection but I didn't really wear them
that often but when I went to buy the
Queen of Hearts palette on their website
I bought a ton of liquid lipsticks and
holy crap I love this color it's the
color I'm wearing right now and it looks
nothing like what it looks in the
freaking bottle and honestly I actually
prefer how it looks on my lips and how
it looks in the tube but this is in the
shade suede and it's a really beautiful
cool toned chocolate color it reminds me
a lot of point zero but this one is more
Brown point zero from colour-pop it's a
little bit more Mavi this one is more
chocolatey I love this color
I'm obsessed I'm obsessed with it I love
this you need suede in your life it's
such a cool color I love how they wear
on the lips they're a little bit drying
like very slightly drying because they
do dry completely matte they don't
transfer at all so they might feel a
little bit drying but I don't mind
because they're not uncomfortable to
wear in my opinion they don't flake off
they stay put and they last all freaking
day also I want to mention this one
because if you're into a metallic liquid
lipstick Frances is something you should
definitely pick up they have a nice
formula there are so many metallic
liquid lipsticks on the market that
don't have a really good formula because
Jenner one in the shade air or the other
one she has kind Majesty I think those
are a little bit too patchy for me
they're nice but they're very very
moosie and sometimes it's hard to apply
because it'll get a little patchy I
always like when lipsticks are good but
I don't like her metallic liquid
lipsticks all that much I got to be
honest I've really just been enjoying
coloured raine liquid lipsticks they
have a ton of colors and I find that
their colors are very unique bold and
beautiful I love them so I've been lucky
news so I want to talk about this bad
boy right here I love this this is the
Too Faced sweet peach creamy peach oil
lip gloss I love them all honestly but I
have been using the shade peach fund the
most it's their lightest shade it's a
very pinky nude I have heard so many
mixed reviews on this product and I
really don't understand
because I love it so much it's unlike
any other lipgloss I have in my
collection it's so nourishing it feels
so different I don't have any other lip
gloss that feels like that when you rub
your like lips together just feel so
plump and airy like bouncy like if
you're just like putting a cloud on your
lips I think they're wonderful I love
this on the most I don't think they're
very long wearing this is definitely a
lip gloss you have to reapply throughout
the day because they're not happy
they're not sticky whatsoever so it
won't stay on your lips for that long
but I don't mind reapplying these at all
because I love how they make my lips
feel and I like the pigmentation I think
it gives you enough color you get enough
shine it's not like super glossy but
it's a nice gloss and it just feels so
incredibly comfortable on my lips I am
obsessed with these and I love the scent
I know a lot of people hate it but it
smells like runs candies to me and I
love it this is the essence long-lasting
lip liner in the shade girl next door
it's just a really pretty nude mauve
color I want to mention this because
I've been using this under a lot of
malls or purple lip colors because it's
still a nude but it's like a mommy nude
I love it these are so affordable and
their retractable I love this very
tractable they're very creamy but
they're not too creamy to where they
slip everywhere but they're not drying I
think it's like a really really great
formula I think these are pretty new the
only thing I will say I don't like about
this is that the top just like falls off
like the top is not very secure so
sometimes I'll open my drawer and I'll
look through my lip liners and it'll
just be like off in a corner so that is
the only thing I don't like but I only
have that problem with the nude one I
don't have that problem with the other
essence lip liners I have anyway this is
really great stuff it says it's
long-lasting but I don't think it's the
most long wearing formula but I mean for
the price it does last a decent amount
of time and they're really really good
quality lip liners I've also been loving
the new girl lactic matte lip paint and
rustic it's a really pretty red orange a
lot of people were actually asking me
but if this looks like Miami fever but
it doesn't this is much more red really
really beautiful color I love shades
like this I love any shade that has a
little bit of orange in it
a girl lacks ik has one of the best
liquid lipsticks on the market seriously
one of the best formulas their shades
Amir is like my favorite girl lactic
liquid lipstick ever bought the old
Zamir I think now they change the name
which I will never understand that whole
situation but anyway I love the shade
and I love the formula if you are
looking for a liquid lipstick that's non
drying but still lasts all day this is
really good I have two more products to
share with you and then this video is
over I wanted to talk about this because
this is like the coolest thing in the
world this is a cake and baked Beauty
sponge by the brand Vera Mona I have
like a backup right here I bought two
and I'm pretty sure I got this off the
Vera Mona website I talked about the ina
using this on her channel and when I
started using it I was like um yeah I
totally want to buy that it's a weird
cuz I'll have someone who really bakes
my face all that much but sometimes I'll
apply my bronzer and it will go down a
little bit too far on my cheek and what
I'll do is I'll get this fun and I'll
dip it into my loose face powder I'll
dip it into that and then I'll just
carve out my cheeks with this sponge and
it does it so perfectly because it's a
beautiful sharp little edge and it just
bakes your face perfectly this is what
it looks like dry it's much smaller I
wet it because I do like how much bigger
it gets when it's wet so it covers more
ground you know and it really makes that
face okay and then my last favorite is
this bad boy right here this is the Kim
Chi and Oprah wander lush moisturizer
and when I first heard about this I was
a little bit skeptical I'm not gonna lie
not because of Kim's high or anything I
think she's beautiful and really funny
and really cute but because it is a
moisturizer but wow I actually really
like this I've been using this as my
daytime moisturizer I'll wake up I'll
wash my face and then I'll apply a very
very light layer of this and I think it
just sinks into the skin so nicely it's
very hydrating but it's not too thick it
doesn't clog my pores and when I look at
the ingredient list there's a lot of
these words I don't know what they are
but the second ingredient is aloe vera
gel which you guys know I am like
addicted to aloe vera if you saw my
skincare update video aloe vera is the
one thing that has been saving my skin I
do prefer it in the plan
like in its natural form but I love that
it has aloe vera in it it just makes my
skin feel nice and soothing and baby
soft like I really like the feel of this
moisturizer so I've been using it a lot
during the day and yes that completes a
pretty guys I'm sorry that it was one
hour long everyone doing this video
leave me a comment down below letting me
know what your favorite product this
month was let me know below but yes I
complete videos thank you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye oh also the Lay's dill
pickle flavor is my favorite lately John
know that face like these chase like if
you had a machine and you put a
McDonald's Big Mac into the machine to
turn it into a potato potato chip potato
- to turn it into a potato chip this is
what would come out this tastes exactly
like the secret sauce that's on a Big
Mac and it's amazing because I haven't
had a Big Mac in like a million years I
don't eat McDonald's anymore like well
but that secret sauce was always really
delicious and it this tastes like it I
bought like ten of these on Amazon I
can't be healthy and I know a lot of you
guys are tweeting me how disgusting you
think this flavor is but I love it okay
I love pickles like on another level I
love pickles I can't eat them right out
of the jar I can eat it like a banana
okay I'm going to go now I'm acting
crazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
