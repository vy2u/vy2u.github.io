my January favorites these are products
I was loving in the month of January
actually it's kind of like a January and
December favorites because I didn't do a
December favorites since I did a yearly
favorites but there were a few things I
was really loving in December as well
whatever my current favorites and
surprisingly there's not like a ton of
stuff to talk about I thought I was just
gonna sit here and talk about so many
things but this is like an average
monthly favourites for me I feel um two
things I want to mention before I get
started one I just got my Invisalign
today and oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my
gosh it is extremely painful but I took
it out to film this video because
honestly it was driving me so crazy that
I was afraid I was just gonna start
screaming in the middle of the video so
I took them out to film this video and
also my hair is a little bit darker I
kind of deepened up my hair and got some
highlights as well
super super natural highlights but if
you're at home and you're like hey
something is different that's what it is
if you want more information on my hair
on my Invisalign and on - suspense of 26
I'm actually gonna be posting a random
rambles video tomorrow because that's
expensive launches tomorrow and I wanted
to give you guys like an extra video
tomorrow so come back to my channel
tomorrow I'm gonna take advantage of the
fact that my Invisalign is not in and
I'm going to drink coffee mmm
I'm gonna get started you know what I'm
not looking forward to though putting
them back in there is nothing that hurts
more than putting your Invisalign back
in after having them out for a little
while but anyway let's just go ahead and
jump into the video okay so my first
favorite is the healthy foundation from
Physicians Formula I have a few things
to say about this one their color
selection freakin sucks I mean I'm not
gonna lie it kind of surprised me
Physicians Formula has had way worse
foundation selections in the past but I
still think it could be a little bit
better I have to mix two shades together
to get my perfect shade because a lot of
them have like a weird gray pink
undertone it's so strange but I love
this foundation I don't like the fact
that it's glass I know a lot of people
love that but I drop and break
everything so I have to be very careful
with it okay I mix the shades lw2
and mw2 and that gives you my perfect
color there
things I don't like besides the color
but what I do love is honestly how
flawless this makes my skin look I'm
wearing it right now
and it just gives me almost like
airbrushed coverage but it feels so
lightweight and it blends into the skin
so flawlessly and so quickly I love
using this with a brush a lot of the
times I'll use a Beauty Blender but I
love using this foundation with a brush
and I really like the coverage it's not
like full full coverage but you can
build it up and get a really good
coverage and it won't get cakey or thick
it doesn't have SPF 20 I wouldn't say
it's the best in photography but I only
wear this like during the day when I'm
not doing much just going like here and
there and hanging out I just love how it
looks unlike a day-to-day basis it's
such a pretty foundation the only things
I don't like about it is it does
transfer pretty easily you have to make
sure you're priming with this foundation
and you have to make sure you are
setting this down you have to set it
because if not it will just like come
off when I want something to last all
day I will reach for something else but
on a day to day I have just been loving
how fresh my skin looks I really like I
really really like this foundation a lot
alright I've also really been loving the
keels powerful strength
lie in reducing concentrate if you saw
me haul this you would have already
known this is a favorite already in that
video it became a favor like the second
I used this one of you guys actually
recommended this to me because I've been
having issues with my smile lines the
struggle of 26
and a lot of foundations will just sink
right into the lines and I find that if
I use this right here in this target
area I'll put a little bit on my finger
I'll play it right here and I'll even
apply a little bit to my forehead when I
use this underneath my foundation it
won't sink into the lines as deeply or
as easily I feel like it really has made
a difference on the way my foundation
looks on the skin I also use this
sometimes in my skincare routine like
I'll use it at night before bed I feel
like it's really helping me out and I'm
also using a few different products that
have been recommended to me to help with
my smile lines but so far I'm really
really loving that one okay so I have
two bronzer favorites when I was really
really really loving in December and I'm
still loving it so much and then the
other one I used mainly this month like
I could not get enough of it this month
the first one being this one of course
this is the glamour dolls bronzer it's
in collaboration with Lisa Frank which
is so freakin cool and it is they're
bitten and bronzed matte bronzer I got
this in an Ipsy bag and I cannot get
enough of this bronzer it's like five
dollars on the glamour dolls website and
it is so good it's a matte bronzer that
is pretty warm and it just makes your
skin look naturally ten that is what I
love so much about it it gives my skin
the perfect amount of warmth
I really am obsessed I think this is my
favorite warm toned bronzer I have ever
used in my life it's just so smooth it
never looks patchy I don't know I love
it I'm wearing it on my face today along
with the other bronzer I have been
loving but it's just so delicious and
warm it's so affordable and so worth it
I think it was like sold out last time I
tried to buy a backup so I hope that was
a limited edition because I will cry and
then the other bronzer I was really
loving in January is from thrive
cosmetics this is the Sun chaser blur
and sculpt bronzing powder and this is
in the shade Raya
um this is amazing this is amazing I
have those two bronzers like mixed
together on my face I mainly use this
one to kind of chisel and contour a bit
it's not super cool tone but I find it
works as a bronzer and a contour this is
the creamiest smoothest most delicious
bronzer ever it just blends like a dream
the formula is amazing it is stunning
and I absolutely love this color they
have a different one I believe they have
two in the line but I think
other one is shimmery I think I'm not
sure but this one is my favorite I love
the formula and I absolutely love the
undertone it's just so nice I have been
pleasantly surprised with this bronzer
it is so good and I really like this
packaging like a lot I love this color
and the best part about thrive Cosmetics
is with every purchase you make I
believe every product you buy they give
one to a woman in need for example women
going through treatments because of
cancer or even women suffering from
domestic violence they give each product
you buy to a woman in need which I think
that is so amazing which makes me want
to buy from the brand even more but this
bronzer so good I love it another
product from this brand that I
completely fell in love with is the
liquid lash extensions mascara guys this
is an amazing mascara for so many
reasons so I was on Twitter one day and
Ryan Leonard here on YouTube had posted
a photo of herself and her lashes looked
insane it was like a faraway photo - and
her lashes it just looked incredible
literally every comment underneath that
photo was like my mascara is thanked and
when she told me it was this I
immediately went on the website and
bought two of them without even trying
them I bought two of them and I'm
honestly so glad I did I'm wearing this
on my lashes right now and it gives you
an insane amount of length an insane
amount of volume it is incredible and
the best part my favorite part is that
it's a tubing mascara this is the best
tubing mascara I have ever tried in my
entire life even more than my trish
mcevoy tubing mascara which was my
favorite until I discovered this one if
you don't know a tubing mascara is
honestly a lazy girl's best friend for
example I have been loving the new
Lancome LUMS few big mascara that I
tried out thanks to Alana but I keep
going back to this because I'm pretty
lazy and I hate taking off my mascara
it's my least favorite part of removing
my makeup it gets everywhere it's just a
pain this makes it so easy because
tubing mascara is all you have to do is
rub a little bit of warm water on your
lashes and they just come off like
little tubes honestly I take it off
every night in the shower I'll just rub
a little warm water and it just slips
right off my lashes
it's incredible it's the best formula
ever because I find that most tubing
mascaras at least the ones I've tried
will give you a lot of length but not
enough volume this gives you everything
okay so I want to give a huge shout out
to the Maybelline city mini palette that
they created in collaboration with
makeup by Shayla holy shiz this palette
is really great I'm not gonna lie it's
not that I didn't expect Shayla to do a
good job on this palette I just I'm not
crazy about Maybelline eyeshadows a lot
of their palettes just are my favorite I
find that there are other brands at the
drugstore that do shadows better but man
this is really good they like bump up
the quality for Shayla but Shayla like
no no no we need to make some good stuff
if you're gonna collab with me which I
hope that was the case cuz this palette
for some reason is better than any other
Maybelline eyeshadow palette I've tried
all of these colors are like necessities
things that you will need and find
yourself using all the time even though
it says tiny little palette it's so
useful like for example today I'm
wearing this gold call this is my
favorite color in the palette I'm
wearing this shade all over my lid today
I used it that way for the first time in
my testing my favorite youtubers 2017
favorites and ever since that video I
have been using that this way so I can I
haven't loved it the entire month but
I've done like four separate looks
already where I apply this eyeshadow on
the center of my lid and it just makes
the whole look come together it gives
you a beautiful glittery golden glow to
the eye it is stunning like I said I'm
wearing it today all the other shadows
on my eyes come from my dream Street
palette but that really pretty shimmery
gold is this guy and I love it not only
that this color right here is perfect
for me to set my entire lid whenever I
put down some concealer I love this
bronze color I love this purple color
and the fact that there's a black in
here is just amazing and it's a great
black as well this brown is also freakin
awesome this is like the perfect little
palette it's so good I'm not sure if
this is limited edition or not but I
bought mine on Amazon and I highly
recommend it so okay so I knew right
away when I got this in the mail that
this was gonna be something everyone was
gonna rave about but since the moment it
arrived on my doorstep I cannot put it
down this is the UA blush duo she way
came out with
different blush tools this one is in the
shade adore you get this bush right here
called adore me and then this one is
called hold me and if you're into nude
blushes yeah you need this one I love
everything about this I love the
packaging I think this is beautiful even
though I don't like flowers I love this
packaging it is stunning I love this
mirror this feels very Charlotte Tilbury
to me and the blushes are beautiful I
really like them both individually I
like as separate blushes but mixed
together they make is the most beautiful
satin delicious like peachy nude
I'm obsessed if you have very fair skin
you will love this especially this color
if you have medium to deep skin tones
you will prefer the other two blushes I
believe there's like a berry one or like
a mauve one and then like a pink one I'm
not sure but those will definitely suit
you if you have a deeper skin tone I
really like how it looks on the skin I'm
wearing both of them mixed on my face
today and I love this duo honestly at
the moment like all I can use is this in
toasted cinnamon okay so with this one
I'm totally cheating I'm 100% on Meghna
cheating
I've only been loving this for a week
but for a week I've been loving this and
I know I'm just gonna be using this
throughout the entire month of March
February that's like February but this
is the new color pop innuendo pressed
powder highlighter palette they finally
answered my prayers they have finally
answered my prayers have been wanting
color pop to come out with a highlighter
palette just like this that gave you
nothing but straight sheen this is what
I wanted gimme more to be well I love
that palette and I use it all the time
I don't use any of the other shades in
the palette this bad boy however all the
formulas are delicious first of all I
love how the names are now printed on
the actual packaging like right
underneath the highlight I believe they
were doing that for like all of their
new palettes even their eyeshadow
palettes but holy guacamole I'm obsessed
with this there's no chunks no glitter
it looks so nice on the skin all of
these colors are beautiful and I feel
like this palette is pretty universal
these are so buttery and smooth I don't
know if they change the formula or
something but they just feel so creamy
and luxurious I love it actually
two mixed on my cheeks day that's what
I'm wearing on my face look at that look
at that
that's like boom wet cheeks I have a
fine line and morning-after mixed
because even though this looks dark in
the pan it's actually a pretty light
highlight fine line is my favorite it's
so pretty but I wanted to give it like a
more peachy golden tone on top so I
mixed in morning after and this one is
beautiful as well the only color in this
palette I do not like at all
is on temple and that's just because it
kind of has like a grey purple undertone
and it looks a little bit muddy on my
skin so loving five out of six is such a
huge deal for me guys I'm so I'm so
happy with it I love this palette okay
so we are almost done all I really have
to talk about our lip products but
before I get into lips I want to like
end it with lips so before I get into
that I do want to give a quick mention
to this bad boy this is definitely an
oldie but a goodie I have been wearing
this non-stop this is Jimmy Choo by
Jimmy Choo I believe the perfume is just
called Jimmy Choo it's the one that
looks like a little grenade and every
time I look at it I think of that Bruno
Mars song but anyway this perfume takes
me back because when I used to work at
the next on the Navy base the next is
the Navy exchange and I used to work in
the electronics department in the back
and you know what the struggle was real
back in the day people in the military
don't make a lot of money and people
working at the mix don't make a lot of
money so I'm gonna give you guys a
little bit of a confession here but
every morning when I would get to the
next I would like sneak over to the
perfume aisle and I would spray like
okay so it wasn't every morning because
I did own my own perfume I used to wear
pink sugar all the time like that was my
goal to fragrance but whenever I wanted
to feel a little bit like pizzazzy I
would just walk on over to the perfume
section and there was a Jimmy Choo
sample that you were allowed to like
spray on the little paper and smell it I
used to spray it on the little paper and
then walk away and then like rub it all
over my body just like I could smell
like this perfume for the day and I
not even joking just doing that I
smelled like this the entire day people
would compliment me on this scent all
the time while I was working there so
this just reminds me of that but anyway
this is one of those perfumes that I get
complimented on the most every time I
wear this even if it has been like 10
hours someone will be like Mooney smells
so good this is one of my most
long-wearing perfumes ever it is up
there with my Chanel perfume like this
last on the body forever and I've just
gone back to it like now every time I
want to put on perfume I just look at
this and I'm like yes and I have just
been wearing this non-stop okay so
lastly let's talk about the lip products
I have been wearing and they're pretty
much all nudes except one okay so the
first one I want to talk about my
actually surprised you considering my
first impression didn't go that well but
it is the Fenty Beauty Stunna lip paint
and this is in the shade uncensored I
think this is the only shade she has the
first time we tried it out in a video
didn't put on a lip liner underneath and
this is just that type of liquid
lipstick that you need to use with a lip
liner because if not it will not last
throughout the day and it will feather
and it will bleed all over your face so
the most part I will wear a red mac
prolongwear lip liner underneath this
just because those Pro Longwear lip
liners literally stay on my face the
entire day they don't come off so that
combo just makes this last for hours and
I don't have any bleeding or feathering
it stays looking really beautiful and I
have to say this is like the most
beautiful red I've ever seen Rihanna
literally launched the perfect shade
it's so Universal like tell me one
person this doesn't look good on nobody
plus I love the applicator it's like
this really weird little nubbin this
weird little ball and at first I didn't
love it but it just makes it so easy to
get a perfect line recently when I
wanted a really nice blue based red I
have been going for this okay so next up
is another healthy product from
Physicians Formula they have these
liquid lipsticks and they're called the
healthy lip and this shade in all
natural nude is stunning I have been
keeping this in my purse and I'll just
pop this on my lips and I feel so like
pretty in this lip color there's
something about it that's so nice I love
the undertone it's honestly like one of
my favorite nude colors to wear now and
I
love this formula does eventually dry
really nicely and it doesn't make your
lips feel tight or dry at all it's a
very very comfortable liquid lipstick
that's why it's called the healthy lip
okay I have to give a huge shout out to
Patrick Starr first of all because this
lip gloss in the shade
she better work just so pretty it's like
the perfect nudie baby pink and I've
only worn this like three times but
every time I've worn it I have just
loved how it looks it looks really
pretty with like a nice deep pinky nude
lip liner underneath like something a
little bit darker and then this on top
it just looks so glossy and glamorous
and I love Patrick so much he deserves
this
he is so hard-working and just such a
good person like I personally love
Patrick Starr and I love this class okay
and then my last lip favorite is
actually a lip combo this is also I'm
kind of cheating with this one too
because I just recently discovered it in
my testing my favorite youtubers
favorite products video this combo is my
life the combo I wore in that video is
my life I have worn it so many times
since that video I can't even tell you
this is the NYX slide on glide on lip
liner in the shade nude suede shoes this
lip liner is gorgeous it's like your
lips but better it's so creamy and so
buttery it's just gliding that's why
it's called slide on glide on I love
this but this on top is perfect this is
the nude sticks lip and cheek pencil in
the shade whisper Thank You Jaime thank
you thank you Emily and thank you jamie
because i love this combo this is such a
creamy lip product even though it's like
ass wooden stick the formula really is
so good on this and I find it really
does last a long time on my lips I don't
know if it's like the combo but I only
have to touch up a couple times I love
this color it's like the perfect nude
you could just throw this in your purse
and I love that it comes in like a
pencil so it's so easy to apply but
anyway guys that completes this video

the month of December and in the month
