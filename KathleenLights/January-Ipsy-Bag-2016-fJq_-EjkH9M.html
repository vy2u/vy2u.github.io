mutt it's a big video where I and I
Glee's actually wasn't going to film
this video because or not today I just
finished filming this makeup tutorial
which should be up already and I was
actually just gonna go ahead and sit
down and watch Jessica Jones on Netflix
but then I realized oh my gosh
I hadn't filmed my Ipsy bag and it's
like almost the end it's like the last
day of the month so that is what we are
doing today I'm going to show you why I
got what I got in this month's bag so
this month's theme says all eyes on you
which is so funny because I'm pretty
sure boxycharm had like an eye theme
this month - what is this a little hair
a streaming Gracie but you know we don't
need that card so this is this is what
the bag looks like this month very like
I don't know Andy Warhol ish do you get
me unless he was inside ok so the first
thing I see is this guy right here and
this says jelly pom-pom curl fairy
lashes mascara and I feel like I've
gotten jelly pong pong in Ipsy and
boxycharm before but I've never heard of
the brand outside of these boxes it's a
natural bristle wand which I typically
tend to go for and I have a full face of
makeup on today so I can't demonstrate
this for you because I even have like
falsies on and usually when I film these
videos I like to demonstrate and like
apply these things for you next month
next month but yes I hope this is good
there cream highlight jelly Hong Kong is
actually really nice I really like it
so hopefully the mascara is just as good
and like I do every month I will have
the prices and everything it listed
below the Ipsy website all that good
stuff ok so next thing in the bag is
really exciting I really love this I
already own this this is the bomb
eyeliner and they're eyeliners are
called mr. right now and this one is in
the color scott it's just a really
pretty dark purple but since I already
have this I'm not going to open it and
I'm going to give it to one of my
friends but these eyeliners are really
really great and this is a full size
product and so was
mascara so that's already two full-size
products in the Ipsy bag so that's
really good these are great eyeliners
next thing is this little guy right here
this says Maersk wait a minute have we
gotten this brand before nipsey bags I
think so
this is just Maersk Maersk that is the
name of the brand I'm going to assume
and this is a mineral eyeshadow in the
shade bud cake and from the outside it
looks like it's really similar to Mac
club like that greenish brown or like
really similar to blue brown by Mac as
well I think it looks more like club if
I could open it oh my chip my nail
polish Donny
some on the little cap so I can show you
that those swatches watch and that is
what it looks like very very similar to
makeup geeks insomnia pigment pigment
pigment it is a really really pretty
color these colors are so popular wet
and wild has a color that looks like
this in there what is that comfort zone
in their comfort zone palette really
pretty color you could even share this
with a friend because you cannot go
through an entire pigment I feel since
there's so much product in a pigment
okay Oh next thing in the bag this says
it's a sugar lip scrub from the Bren
Hanalei Hanalei mm-hmm it says massage
on to lips to exfoliate dryness then
wipe away with a tissue and oh it
doesn't I was expecting like some sugary
scent oh okay it's a little bit lemony
yep it's a little lemony and let me just
put it on the back of my hand oh it's
very thick you know what I think I'm
really gonna like this simply because
it's very very oily I don't know how to
explain it not that it's oily but yeah I
would say it's pretty oily so it's not
just like sugar packed into a little pot
because I mean let's face it we could
create lip scrubs at home this is
totally unnecessary but even when I
wiped it away right
now my skin feels incredibly hydrated
it has like a oily consistency but still
it has a lot of sugar in it so I feel
like not only would it exfoliate but it
would also like really hydrate your lips
I'm actually going to keep this in my
bap and use it tonight and then the last
thing in the bag is this little guy
right here it is the pur Lisse Blue
Lotus form one I adore serum I'm going
to keep this in my little travel drawer
I have a little drawer of a bunch of
traveling products whenever I travel you
know to take the little things instead
of my full-size because I already own
this I got the full-size in a boxy charm
so I'm just going to keep this in my
little travel drawer so that was
everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month um it's really cool that we got
two full-sized products this month for
some reason this month I just was not
excited for it see and I don't know I
see myself using the sugar scrub and I
hope that the mascara is good I'm gonna
pass on the eyeliner since I already
have it but it is a really good oiler so
leave me a comment down below what you
got in your empty back in the bag
I'm like out of it today I don't know if
you guys can tell I'm out of it today
what did you get in your if see bag
because I know everybody gets different
things it's not like boxycharm where you
get like pretty much the same thing
everybody does get something different
for it see so let me know what you got
did you like it did you hate this month
what did you get tell me thank you guys
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
