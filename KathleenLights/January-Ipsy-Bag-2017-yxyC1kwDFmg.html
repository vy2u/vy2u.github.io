much it's the bag and banging this is
getting out of hand see poor does this
thing where he scratches the couch and
the blanket bent on that so he can get
comfortable and he'll lay on it but he
does it for like hours and hours then I
feel better to stop him because you know
he looks like he's having a great time
and there must be a purpose to why he's
scratching it why are you scratching it
right before he lays down it is to make
the couch warmer maybe that creates
friction and makes it a little hot and
then he lays on it so he's like nice and
warm I don't know I'm not dog you can
see a little patience never hurt anyone
anyway so today's video is going to do
my entity bag I'm bagging which is why I
don't really have makeup on because I'm
going to be applying some of these
products to my face you know the drill I
do this with all my unboxings well I
only unbox it see and boxycharm but I do
this for both of them I didn't post the
video last month because my bag
literally got here on the last day of
the month sometimes as he does that
sometimes I get it like on the 10th like
really early in the month and sometimes
it takes a little bit longer I don't
mind but when it comes to uploading a
video I do kind of mind it's like I
would like it to get here a little
sooner so I can post about it anyway I
memorized jamás I was going to change
before it's on this video but I was like
you know what my subscribers liked me
for who I am now for what I wear I'm
gonna be honest I'm not going anywhere
today okay so let's just get in here so
this is what the bag looks like this
month it has like tiny little holes
everywhere if you're someone who doesn't
like holes I know that a lot of people
have like a fear of holes or sinkholes
gross him out you might not like this
bag it comes with a little card inside
and it also came with the first product
in the actual pink bag because I guess
it didn't fit in the FC bag so let's
just tackle that one first this is the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye
illumination I have tried the regular
bye-bye under-eye but not the
illumination version so I'll be trying
that today they sent the shade medium
which I feel like it might work for me
and have like that pinky tone to it it's
a very very thick concealer would cover
your dark circles like this the only
thing that throws me off about having
concealers foundations BB creams or
anything like that in the bag it's like
how do you know what colors to send I
know I'm the Ipsy website I did
a little serving and I put my skintone
all that but do they go through each and
every person and make sure that they're
sending the correct tone I don't know I
feel like your subscription boxes
concealers and things like that that are
specific to each person's skin tone can
be a little difficult I don't know what
do you think did you guys get this in
your FC bag and is it your exact color I
would love to know and I am going to
turn it on but there's actually a BB
cream in here that I'm going to try on
first so it only make sense but my BB
cream on and then that let's open this
actually let's look at this guy first so
this is a pretty woman nail polish I
love receiving nail polishes I feel like
I can never have enough so this is the
color perfect for spring it's a really
pretty lavender lilac shade with a
little bit of pink this color actually
reminds me a lot of a color from kale
polish that has not been released
I love nail polish I love trying
different nail polishes I love trying
out new brands and just seeing what's
out there I'm like addicted to nail
polish I wish on my nails right now but
I am wearing nail polish already I was
doing like some product shots of
something and I had to put on nail
polish but anyway so you get a few girl
nail polish
I love getting nail polish and
subscription boxes okay so the next
thing in the bag is actually this little
guy right here this is the real
chemistry luminance 3-minute peel so
they don't have a card that tells me
everything I go by what the bottle says
so it says it's not a mask cleanse skin
and leeks lightly damp spread gel
assembly and quickly over here for
cheeks chin neck and decollete quickly
begin massaging these areas in a
circular motion with slightly damp hands
after about 15-20 seconds
solids should form under the fingertips
this means the peel is activating
correctly as a gel is now combining with
your dead skin I want you to try this
out right now but my face needs to be
damp my fingers need to be damned let's
see what it feels like on my hands Oh
like in jail this is like one of those
chemical exfoliator --zz where you feel
like your dead skin is coming off but I
don't know if that's dead skin I'm
always skeptical about these kinds of
products the ones you start blending
into your face and then like little
balls for to fill up and it's supposedly
your dead skin but I don't know I find
that
so crazy oh whatever let's try it I'm
going to go deaf in my face okay I've
got a damp face and a damp towel and my
hands are damp
let's hope this doesn't irritate my skin
because my bumpy's are coming back
there's like six on my forehead right
now I don't know what's happening
because I haven't had any come butoh so
I don't know what is happening why
they're coming back but they're coming
back so maybe I should avoid my forehead
or not dampen my hands yeah you feel
like I feel like it's impossible to lift
all of this dead skin almost instantly
like the second you start rubbing it in
but your dead skin comes off I don't
know I don't know if that's a dead skin
honestly I'm going to go rinse this off
it's a little hard to written face when
you have your eyebrows on and mascara
okay so my face feels really really soft
line touch it but kind of feels a little
tight
it's a luminous three-minute peel oh it
was totally not doing that for three
minutes but it just feels like tight but
it does feel really soft
I don't know I'm torn the next product
in my bag is this little guy right here
this is a Smashbox camera ready BB cream
broad-spectrum SPF 35 I've never tried
this before I used to use the BB water
all the time I loved that last summer
they sent me the shade light lunch
medium and when i swatched it on my hand
earlier today yeah it's like too dark
for me is that right there is going to
be luck but we're going to do it anyway
Oh
oh my gosh I couldn't even zoom you in
so I mean the color is obviously
obviously too dark for me but once you
start blending it in it's not terrible I
get together at the BB cream it doesn't
really have much coverage so I just
finished watching the series finale of
Gilmore Girls my friend Stephanie is
like obsessed with our show so she's
been asking me to watch it just so that
I can watch a year into life so I
watched all seven seasons of Gilmore
Girls and I have to be completely honest
with you like I was so underwhelmed by
that series finale so many unanswered
questions more than terrible it was not
like a Dexter finale but it wasn't my
favorite okay so this is the BB cream on
my face obviously it's not my shade I
like the finish I like the feel I like
that it's very very light coverage like
I mean it's a typical BB cream I do
notice that it looks like it has more
coverage in certain areas and then
lighter coverage and others but maybe
that was probably the way I applied it
Finnick it's a little patchy in some
areas okay so now we can test out the a
cosmetics bye bye under-eye illumination
concealer Oh what did I do now I'm all
over the place in this video I am so
sorry by the way this brush I was using
to apply the beauty cream this is from a
cosmetics it's love is the foundation
brush I think I purchased it during like
a breast cancer awareness sale they had
I think this was like limited position
for that and I think they brought it
back and I'm obsessed with it I bought
it at Ulta it's a freaking heart how
cute is that so I'm going to take a
little bit of this concealer and I'm
gonna apply just smallest amount
underneath my eyes a little go such a
long way with this product like I said
and have the original bye-bye under-eye
and it can get really intense I'm just
going to squeeze a tiny bit up stop a
quarter that actually looks really good
I think that apply just a little bit
more I have a very dry under-eye so a
lot of the times this concealer doesn't
really work for me like right now you
can kind of see the dryness every time I
use this concealer I have to vote the
original I have to put on an eye cream
underneath like a nice hydrating eye
cream that's the only way
could use it but it's just so good to
cover up your dark circles it covers
everything it's so full coverage I think
the illumination one might be less
coverage than their original one because
I don't know if you can tell what do
they think but some over here okay maybe
it is the same coverage as the original
so I'm going to add a little bit of this
right here and right here just to
brighten up the under-eye area
okay so I actually do really like this
concealer I think it is more
illuminating and then the original now
that I applied some more
it is very brightening I don't know
unless you can really like that it does
look a little bit drying underneath my
eyes if you have very dry under eyes
like me it will look a little bit cakey
just remember to use very little and
maybe you're going to want to put an eye
cream underneath I highly recommend that
okay so then the last thing in the bag
is a brush this is the beauty basics
contour blush brush it's for contour and
for blush personally for me it's just
too tiny for blush I don't know I mean
I'll try to use it today for blush but
it's just so small the contour though
this could definitely work I just never
really used brushes like this to contour
I don't know if you guys have noticed
I'm going to take my charlotte tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow and I'm going to
take the bronzer and I'm going to just
contour my cheeks I did not press my
face or my concealer I just realized
that but this mirror is dirty you can
see actually yeah this person is
definitely my face is orange this brush
is definitely small enough to get right
into the hollows of the cheeks so this
is really good for contouring
I'm going to take my wedding wild
apricot in the middle blush and I'm
going to clean my brush off on this
towel inside Inuk
not my favorite way to apply blush at
all but I mean it's not terrible
I just prefer a bigger fluffier rounder
brush personally I would recommend this
more for contour than for blush but bez
Disney okay so that completes this video
that was everything that was inside my
Ipsy bag of this month I have to be
completely honest and only thing that I
really liked was the under eye concealer
oh and I'm sure that this nail polish is
really good to make sure things were the
only things that really tickle my pickle
the rest I was like you know that BB
cream not my shade a lot of the times I
really really like it see but this month
it was kind of like for me we have let
me know what you have in your SD bag did
you love it this month if you hate it
what did you get let me know in the
comments and yeah I can leave this video
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
disturbs my jumbo Hey I'll coordinate
hungry so I mean so I'm going to take a
little bit of it personally I would
recommend this more for comp personally
I would recommend this more for contour
than for brush</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
