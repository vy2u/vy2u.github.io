in my Ipsy bag video we're gonna walk
through my empty bag try on a couple
products and see how I like this month I
do quickly want to say I'm so sorry
there was no video posted on Monday
Thursday night before I went to bed I
was like laying in bed and I was like oh
no my nose is stuffy and I just that's
like the first sign once my nose starts
to good stuff and like there's a cold
coming and when I woke up I had the
sniffles I was coughing and I just had
kinda like a cold this past weekend but
I feel better today and I wanted to do
something just a little bit more
laid-back like my Ipsy video sorry there
isn't something more exciting going up
today but I had to get this up and you
know I wasn't feeling you the best so I
thought this was the perfect in-between
kind of video but anyway do you like
your shirt I know you do I know you do
let's get started alright so you guys
know the drill I like to see what's in
my Ipsy bag before I show you so I know
what products to put on my face I mean I
know I explain it every month but I feel
like sometimes I get new subscribers
through my Ipsy videos but anyway this
is what the bag looks like this month
it's so summery to me and it's like
January right No so the first product is
this guy
this is the dermelect micro facial
exfoliating mask and I'm pulling up epsy
on my phone so I can tell you like the
what this costs like the full-size cuz
this is a deluxe step because this is a
deluxe sample of this the full-size is
$38 and this is supposed to be a multi
brightening conflicts that immediately
restores complexion from lackluster and
dull to luminous and radiant and I
actually used this right before I sat
down to film this video it says you're
supposed to massage this onto damp skin
in circular motions and then leave it on
for 12 minutes and then rinse it off
with warm water and that's what I did
and honestly I liked it it's like an
exfoliator and a mask and one it made my
skin feel really soft I mean most
exfoliators do I don't think there's
anything special to it but there's
nothing negative about it either I don't
know I feel like I have to use this a
little bit more to see if it's like a
staple for me or not I feel like it did
what it claims to do my skin looks
really bright and like healthy-looking
when I took it off so I really liked
that good stuff I mean this is a really
nice sample you could take it with
yourself when your travel
I mean I like this ice okay so the next
thing in the bag is the weird product
this is the product that I didn't quite
understand this is from a brand called
evolu it says Lou or Leo here on the
front so when you go on the website it's
like evil you I cannot say this word
totally pronouncing that wrong but this
is the balanced hydrating and calming
serum and I feel like this is really
strange at least for me it says you're
supposed to apply a thin layer after
cleansing use morning and night and
that's what I did I mean I cleanse my
face with this this is like a mask and
then after I like cleansed my face and
then I went in with this before I went
in with my makeup and at first this did
feel nice and soothing and hydrating
like as I was applying it at the second
and sink into my skin it was like it was
completely gone like this sinks into the
skin and then it disappears so I don't
find this to be very hydrating at all
quite quite the contrary I will say
because as I was sitting there I was
letting it sink in I was about to apply
my makeup my face felt really tight like
I was weighing like this and it felt
like just kind of like a film over my
skin and my face just felt tight but
when I would touch my face I was like
nothing was there I don't know this is a
little strange for me I'm gonna look
into it a little bit more there was some
good reviews online so I want to see if
maybe if I use this underneath the
moisturizer I mean I don't know but I
didn't find this to be hydrating like
whatsoever but that's just me if you got
this in your hips you back this month
let me know like did I do something
wrong is it supposed to feel that way my
skin is super dry so I don't know
alright so next up we've got this this
is an eyeliner from the brand
bellapierre I feel like we always get
this brand in either a box a charmer an
Ipsy bag this is the gel eyeliner and
this is a green color which is kind of
Awesome for Ipsy to send because I would
have expected them to send a black or a
brown but I have a million of those I
mean obviously this isn't as wearable as
a black or a brown so I'm sure a lot of
people at home were like yeah I would
have preferred a black or brown but I
think it's kind of cool that it's green
this is in the shade metallic green so
I'm gonna try it out
I hate these little thingies plasticky
papers hmm I always dunno losing my
teeth I feel like they purposely make it
impossible
like it like we do it on purpose and I
go to eat I go to eat you know so me
Wayne
alright let's see oh this actually looks
really nice I feel like other
bellapierre are they ours we've used in
the past like with Ipsy have been like
wooden eyeliners am i making that up I
don't know but anyway I'm just gonna
plan it to my waterline see how this
goes
okay you really have to apply some
pressure because it doesn't it doesn't
really glide on the waterline
but if you apply it directly to the skin
and not on the waterline it does it does
show up okay so I'm not gonna lie this
was a little bit of a struggle
you guys saw as I was trying to apply it
to my waterline it really wasn't showing
up on the waterline but once I put it
like on the actual skin and smudged it
out it did give me a nice green eyeliner
look I mean I like the color you can
totally see it's green it's just very
rough and it's not something that's
gonna glide right on it's not super
creamy it's definitely more on the waxy
side yeah not my favorite for sure it
was just it was too rough it was like
alright so this next product is actually
freaking awesome this is the bum's
mary-lou manizer this is a classic
highlight like there was a point on
YouTube where this was everyone's
favorite highlighter it was a hundred
percent a cult favorite everybody was
wearing mary lou manizer this was like
when i started youtube and it was big it
was so big with for good reason it is
the most beautiful champagne highlight
ever I don't know why people don't talk
about it anymore I mean neither do I so
I guess but it really is stunning
because it gives you like an intense
highlight while being natural at the
same time and I actually like this
little sample size because it's like the
size of an eyeshadow you can take it
with yourself traveling use it as an
eyeshadow and use it as a face highlight
as well
and of course I'm gonna pop them on my
cheekbones it really is like the perfect
bridal highlight alright so this
definitely gets an A+ from me I love
this highlight definitely the highlight
of the bag so far but it and then the
last thing in the bag I'm actually
really excited for as well I haven't
tried this color this is from the brand
new takes this is the magnetic matte lip
color and this is in the shade Joyce
which looks like a delicious beautiful
brown I cannot wait okay so I'm just
going to apply that actually really love
the size of this this fits right into
your little purse even your tiny little
clutch even those little wallet purses
that you put your phone in and like your
ID and my credit card even in there you
could like slide this in there this fits
anywhere I don't know why it's called
the magnetic matte lip color though like
Y magnetic
oh my god
Joyce you speak to my soul in ways that
I can't explain
okay so this product just made the
entire bag for me
things were looking a little rough
they're not gonna lie but these two
products just they just did it for me
especially this like this made the whole
bag because I honestly feel like I would
pay $10 for this I love this color so
much and my Ipsy bag is $10 like that's
how much I pay for it so this month was
totally worth it for this I love this
color and all its really dark really
vampy super intense but oh my gosh I
think it is so cool it's sunny and I
love these nude Stix
oh my gosh and barely any transfer I
think I have found a new lover I'm so
excited
Oh Joyce we're gonna have great times
together anyway guys that was my Etsy
