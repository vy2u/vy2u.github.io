July favorites these are just a few
products that I've really been loving
recently and I'm gonna be sharing them
with you so let's go so the first thing
I want to talk about is a major favorite
of mine and it is the st. Tropez
one-night-only instant glow body lotion
and basically what this is is a
one-night-only self-tanner
so you apply this to your whole body but
then when you take your shower it washes
right off but yeah this is not gonna be
the type of self-tanner that you apply
to your body and then it's gonna develop
overnight or something like that and
then last around five days this is not
gonna do it this is a one-night-only
type of product which I really really
love I use this on special occasions
when I want to look extra glowy and
extra Jennifer Lopez II I would just
pump this into my hand and apply it all
over my body or the places that are
gonna be visible when I go out like if
I'm wearing a dress I'll apply it to my
legs to my arms and my chest and stuff
like that and it gives a beautiful deep
glow like a dark tan with a little bit
of glow to it it is just so gorgeous I
will usually apply this around 3 to 4
hours before I'm gonna go out that night
so I'll do it during the day and just
hang out and like pajamas and stuff and
then put on my clothes at night so that
it doesn't transfer onto the clothes
because if you put this on and then
immediately put your clothes on it will
stain your clothes so yeah I've just
really been loving this for a quick
Jennifer Lopez look I love it so this
next product has been a favorite of mine
for a really long time but I just want
to mention it because I've been using it
a lot recently and it is my fit me
powder in the shade 135 creamy natural
this is a lot lighter than my skin and
it is a little bit more of a pinky
undertone like a beige undertone and I
use this to set my under eye concealer
and I love this powder I used to swear
by the Mac MSF natural which I still do
it's my holy grail powder but this is a
really nice one from the drugstore
because I have dry skin most powders
look terrible terrible on my face
how semi under-eye concealer with a
powder and then it'll just look cakey
and gross but this is just so finely
milled and so thin and buttery that it
doesn't cake up my under eye and I'm
obsessed
I love the entire Maybelline fit me line
I think they're great especially if you
have dry skin because they're nice and
creamy and amazing so I definitely
recommend this if you're looking for a
great powder to set like your under-eye
woods or something these are really good
my next favorite is actually a concealer
and it is the LA girl Pro conceal HD
high definition concealer I love this
concealer it's really really great and
super inexpensive I believe it's under
five dollars and it's such high quality
when I first got this I was afraid it
was gonna be exactly like the hard candy
glamoflauge concealer which if you're
familiar with that is really really
thick it's good for covering blemishes
but it's terrible for your under-eye
area like do not use it underneath your
eyes it's thick and cakey but I thought
it was going to be similar because it's
kind of like them the same type of
packaging but this concealer is so great
it is full coverage but blends nicely I
don't know how to explain it it is a
thicker formula like when you apply it
underneath your eyes but once you blend
it in with a brush it blends so easily
that you can't believe it's thick like
you can't believe it's full coverage
because it blends so well I have mine in
the shade natural and it has a little
bit of a pink undertone which I like for
underneath my eyes I really love this I
definitely recommend these pro conceal
concealers if you're looking for a full
coverage under-eye concealer the next
thing I want to talk about are hair care
products the first thing is this
Moroccan oil treatment I have been using
this non-stop you guys know I'm obsessed
with any type of oil
I love argan oil any kind of oil I love
to drench my hair in it because I have
really dry frizzy hair and this month my
oil of choice is Moroccan oil I love it
it's alcohol-free and it's for all hair
types what I love most about this oil is
that it's pretty lightweight at least on
my hair so I put it in I don't really
feel it it does not weigh my hair down I
use this oil on my curly hair days I
don't really use it when my hair is
straight because I have another like
serum a type of product that I really
love for my straight hair but on my
curly hair days I just put one pump of
this and lather it on my ends and that's
what I use in my hair today it just
keeps my frizz down he's just on my wet
or dry hair it does
no matter it's just an overall great oil
and then my other haircare favorite is
my healthy sexy hair soy touchable
weightless hairspray but this hairspray
is wonderful it does have argan oil like
infused in it and what I love most about
this is that it's not crunchy I used to
hate hairspray I never wore hairspray
ever but this hairspray is one of the
few hair sprays that once I spray my
whole head with it I could still brush
it out and it still feels like soft and
weightless it doesn't give your hair
that really crunchy feeling but yet it
still keeps the curls so I'll use this
whenever I like curl my hair or whenever
I put it in a braid and I want it to
stay all day I'll just spray this and it
holds some but it still leaves my hair
pretty so I want to quickly give a huge
shout out to one of my new favorite nail
polish brands and it is Julie G nail
lacquers these new polishes are amazing
I have five of them so far and I've just
been loving them so much I actually have
like 10 more in my shopping cart online
that I'm planning on ordering the
quality of these nail polishes are so
great and what's crazy about them is
that they're only 399 I believe so
they're really inexpensive and to me
they're comparable to like OPI or
something like that I love them so much
more than I thought I would the formula
is really nice I know a couple people
have problems with these nail polishes
but the ones that I've tried have had no
problems with they go on really smoothly
and with two coats I'm good
none of them feel sticky or streaky the
only one that the formula is a little
bit off on is this one right here and
it's called 9 to 5 but the color is so
amazing that I do not care if it's
streaky I do three coats of this and
then I'm good to go
but the one that I have been really
obsessed with is this one right here
this one is in the shade Santorini and
it is a really close dupe to SES bikini
so teeny
this is bikini so teeny right here and
this is Santorini so it's only like
slightly darker but they're really
really close the center anyone even has
that like silver sheen going through it
can't really see on the nails just like
bikini so teeny I really love Essie nail
polishes for their colors but I do not
like their formula they chip on my nails
so freakin easily that it just really
bugs me I buy them for the colors cuz I
think they're amazing but I was just so
impressed with these nail polishes and
this did not chip okay guys
my nails are notorious for chipping very
rarely do I come across a brand that
doesn't really chip on my nails and I do
use a base coat I've tried a million
different things the only way I can get
it to work as if I use a good base coat
and a good top coat and then the last
pretty long but even then they chip
pretty fast but this was on my nails a
full seven days without chipping that is
unheard of and even this color was on my
nails for a really long time they're
just so incredibly good like incredibly
good if you're wondering these other
three colors just in case you want to
know what the names aren't this one is
in stiletto
this one is oMG it is a hot hot pink so
pretty so amazing and this one is in
shark's Cove it's a beautiful color I
don't know I'm not explaining like a
greeny greeny bluey
Sharp's Cove so yeah I just wanted to
give these guys a quick mention because
I think that the formula is great they
last longer my nails they're really
inexpensive and they are fantastic my
next favorite is a brush by makeup geek
and it is the fissile brush right here
it is the face buffer brush and I have
been using this brush for my blush ever
since I got it I love this brush so much
it is really incredibly soft and I love
the fact that you can get a soft
application or really intense
application with this whatever I'm
dealing with blushes that don't have a
crazy good pigmentation to them I just
dipped my brush into the blush and then
I pack it on my cheeks and it gives me
an intense application of the blush like
it puts it on really really pigmented
and it's just the perfect size it just
fits right on my cheeks and I love that
you could buff it out and make it really
sheer as well so if you have a blush
that it's just way too pigmented that
you need to use a light hand just dip it
in really lightly and then buff it onto
the cheeks and it just blends out really
nicely this is a great brush okay so my
next product I'm like really
obsessed with it it is the Ben Nye
powder Rouge blush in the shade contour
number one these are their powder Rouge
of blushes but this is obviously for
contouring hence the name contour number
one they have two different shades they
have contour number one and then contour
number two I think contour number two is
just a little bit warmer or a little bit
too warm for me and I wanted something a
little bit more cool toned for
contouring I got this at camera-ready
cosmetics calm and it was ten dollars
and worth every penny holy cow this is
the perfect contouring powder in the
world this puts all my bronzers to shame
in terms of contouring because it's
specific for contouring it's not a
bronzer it's a contour powder in my
opinion it just has it the perfect
undertone to contour with and so many
different skin tones can use this shade
and it'll still look nice because it
blends so nicely so if you have really
fair skin you just lightly put it in the
holes of your cheeks and then blend it
really well and it blends so nicely
there's something about this powder that
just blends so nicely I don't even know
how to explain it it's a great powder
for contouring like I said this is Ben
Nyes powder Rouge in the shade contour
number one okay so the next few products
I want to talk about are all about
lashes and the first things are false
lashes and they are the red cherry
lashes just red cherry in general as a
brand I want to mention because these
are so great for the price I buy my red
cherry lashes for about 250 apiece on
madame madeline calm and they're just so
inexpensive they're cheaper than ardell
lashes and personally i think they're
better I do love our doll lashes don't
get me wrong like the whispies and the
demi whispies are great but these are
cheaper not by much but they are cheaper
and I think that they're better I think
you get more uses out of these I've used
a pair of red cherry lashes like five
times in a row before and I can still
use them a bunch of times more my
personal favorite ones are the 747 m/s
but here I have really fun ones and
these are numbers
Sene they have a bunch of different like
a bunch of different ones and they're so
good and so inexpensive the band is
super thin so it's really easy to work
with and their grades it says 100% human
hair and I don't know I just I really
love red cherry lashes if you are
looking for really good inexpensive
lashes I recommend red cherry 100% so my
last two things that have to do with
legends have to do with natural lashes
if you are not a false lash where I
never used to be I just started to get
into false lashes and honestly I don't
feel like putting on fake eyelashes
every single day I don't know how people
can do it like more power to you if you
can but I just can't deal with wearing
falsies every single day I like you know
some mascara so the mascara that have
been so obsessed with is this one right
here this is the Mac and extreme
dimension 3d black lash they have
another one that's in a black tube but
it has the white lettering like this
size of Mac Mac Mac Mac Mac all around
that you can't tell because it's also
like a black lettering but they have
another mascara that is in the exact
same tube but it is just called an
extreme dimension this one is in extreme
dimension 3d black lash and this is the
one I love this makes my eyelashes so
thick and volumizing it's incredible
actually wore this one day and then I
went over to my sister's house and she
was like what's on your lashes because
they've never looked this good and I was
like oh really I'm gonna go that's a
crazy good compliment that says a lot
about this mascara the wand is a rubber
wand which I typically do not like I
usually hate rubber bristle ones but
this one just works it has pretty much
the same exact wand as the benefits
they're real mascara if you're familiar
with that you know it has like a spiky
little ball at the top this one has it
too so I feel like it's really easy to
get into the inner corners of my lashes
like these tiny little lashes towards
the tear duct area really easy to get a
hold of those lashes with this mascara
and I've tried both of the they're real
mascara and this one and I think this
one is 10 times better
and it is a lot easier to remove but it
lasts on my lashes all day I love it if
you are someone who does not like lot of
what I don't know what accident that was
if you are someone who does not like
thick lashes stay away from this because
this makes it very thick I do too thin
coats because anything more than that
can get a little bit clumpy this is that
kind of mascara that if you build it up
too much it does get clumpy so keep that
in mind but I like mascaras like that
because I really love thick voluminous
lashes and then my last favorite I am so
pleased with and I'm so happy that I
love it so much because it was expensive
and it is my shoe Laura eyelash curler
I'm pretty sure that I'd say I could be
wrong I suck at pronouncing Shula Lora
Shula Laura
it's an eyelash curler and this little
sucker was $20 okay $20 for an eyelash
curler but holy guacamole I am so glad
that i invested in this eyelash trailer
because it is the best eyelash curler I
have ever used in my life it is amazing
it is so good I have struggled with
finding a good eyelash curler for a few
years now I used to use the elf eyelash
curler and it ripped my eyelashes out
really badly I hated it I know a lot of
people loved it but it just ripped like
I would find eyelashes on the eyelash
curler and I had nothing to do with me
some people were saying that I wasn't
using it correctly but no I was using
the eyelash curler correctly it just it
didn't work for my eye shape I'm
guessing so I stopped using that and I
tried a bunch of different ones from the
drugstore and they were okay it just it
I felt like it didn't make an incredible
difference on my lashes so I bit the
bullet and I bought this shoe and Laura
won and the first time I use it I was
like and not only do they make them look
really nice and curled but it is the
most comfortable eyelash curler I've
ever used like once you put your
eyelashes in and you squeeze it doesn't
pull out your lashes this is the first
eyelash curler that I feel like I can
squeeze as hard as I can and it doesn't
hurt irritate my eyes I don't squeeze as
hard as I can
I never did with any eyelash curler but
it's just so gentle and it gives it such
a nice
and it's just so comfortable my eyelets
just fit perfectly in this little curve
and it's so easy to work with this is
like the so amazing amazing worth every
single penny they were expensive but
worth it
girl well okay so my last favorite is
not a beauty favorite and it technically
doesn't count as a monthly favorite
because I've only had this little thing
for a week but I've still been loving it
and it is my new puppy
it's a little new puppy this is our new
puppy
Danny named her Celine after the girl
from underworld kate beckinsale Danny
loves that movie but this is Celine and
she is so precious she's a little bit of
a beyotch but I love her like constantly
biting Cornelius and I know that she's a
puppy so she doesn't really know any
litter but she is so sweet I love her so
much Cornelius can't say the same he
doesn't really like her he's just very
very jealous and doesn't really like
that there's a new pup in town so he's
just he's just he's not having it I'm
hoping that that'll change I mean it's
they've only been around each other for
a week so I'm hoping that he ends up
liking her
I hope so cuz that would suck but this
is she's so cute a lot of people have
asked me if you follow me on like
Twitter and Instagram a lot of people
have asked me what type of dog she is
and I have no idea I actually got her
from the Humane Society so we she's like
a rescue is that what when you get dogs
with the Humane Society the rescue dogs
right whatever I don't know but we got
her from the Humane Society so when we
asked what she was the lady said that
when they don't know what type of dog
they have they just write Terrier on the
paper but she thinks but down the line
she might have some Australian Shepherd
to her but we actually I have no idea
what she is if any of you guys are the
dog whisperers out there what type of
dog is she what do you think I don't
know
recetas but don't be fooled
my main favorite is always him you're
the favorite okay so those were all my
favorites from the month of July I know
