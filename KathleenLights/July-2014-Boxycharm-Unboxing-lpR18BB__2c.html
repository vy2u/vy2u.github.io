july bucks a charm unboxing and this
month i'm right on schedule
so i'm just going to go ahead and break
into this bad boy okay so this is what
the box looks like on the inside this
month for boxycharm
every single month there is a new theme
and this month it is America the
beautiful and I love boxy charm because
they give you a full list of the
products you get and the prices so I
love that so the first thing I see in my
box is this purely sick okay I don't
know how to pronounce this pur Lisse a
pur Lisse pur I'm butchering that and I
know you're gonna correct me in the
comments and that's okay because I have
no idea how to pronounce this but this
is an SPF 30 sunscreen broad-spectrum
normal to dry skin essential daily
moisturizer I know that a lot of people
have been getting this in their
subscription box I think that a couple
people got it in there if see bag this
month or like a couple of months ago but
an Ipsy you got like a sample size and
in box a charm you get the full you get
the full size actually never tried this
out before but I've heard really good
things about it the full size of this is
$55 that is double what you pay for your
boxycharm um that's really expensive
it also says it's an anti-aging
moisturizer which um I'm all for so I
will definitely give this a shot and let
you guys know how I feel about it it's
crazy that there's a 55 dollar product
in the box crazy okay so the next thing
I see in my box is this gorgeously
beautiful nail polish this is by the
brand called Lauren B beauty I've never
tried any of the nail polishes from
Lauren B but the packaging is so
gorgeous if you're a packaging person
like me and the full side oh I'm so used
to saying any full size version when
this is the full size version by the way
this is also full size when Ipsy I
usually say full sized version because
we usually get samples but this is full
size and so is this so this retails for
$18 that's a pricey nail polish it's
more expensive than like OPI and Essie
all that stuff so I'm excited to try
this then we have three more things this
is a bellapierre cosmetics pigment I
guess like eyeshadow powder in the shade
bubblegum and it's just basically yeah
it's like a loose pigment and it's just
in like a really light shimmery metallic
kind of color I don't typically go for
these colors but this would probably be
like a really nice brow bone highlight
this little guy is also full size and it
retails for $15
well 49 then the next thing in my box is
this appeal Cosmetics lipstick I've
never heard of the brand appeal
cosmetics at least I don't think so and
this is what the packaging looks like
it's really nice sleek packaging and
this is the color I am obsessed with
colors like this usually in boxycharm
everybody gets the exact same products
but I'm pretty sure that um people got
different shades of lipstick I think
some people got a nude lipstick some
people got this one I think it depended
on your box but this is the shade I got
and this is in the color does it not say
oh V okay the shade is called V like
literally like the letter V yeah so it's
a gorgeous gorgeous hot hot pink color I
love these kind of colors in the summer
really excited to try this this is
obviously full size as usual and this
retails for $22 so just with this
product you already paid for your
boxycharm and then the last thing in the
Box is this bellapierre another
bellapierre product and it is a lip
liner this is just like a burnt brick
red color I really love colors like this
but I'm not a fan of wooden lip liners
because they tend to be really drying on
the lips and putting it on my hand it is
pretty drying already so I don't know
how I'm gonna feel about this but this
is also a full-sized product and this
retails for $18 ah okay guys so that was
everything I got in this month's
boxycharm I'm obsessed with this box and
I've said it many many times but if you
don't know it is a beauty subscription
service but it is $21 a month and I know
that may seem like a lot for some people
but you know how you pay $10 for it see
but you get sample sizes
you always get full-size product in your
boxycharm
so I got 5 products in this month's box
and they were all full-size the total
value of this box is 128 dollars or 127
undertones up does matter over 125
dollars that is crazy that is real 128
dollars in your box because everything I
got was full-sized just this moisturizer
alone is $55 mica woo this is basic
I'm not like super over the moon with
this box like I was last month last
month was like a heavenly amazing box
but I'm really really excited
specifically for these two items this
nail polishes gorgeous and this colors
amazing um I'm definitely going to try
this out but I'm not a huge fan of the
bellapierre cosmetics I've never tried
Belle appear but these this lip liner
seems a little bit drying and actually
this color is really pretty and it was
super pigmented so I can't complain
about that the only complaint I have is
this lip liner I'm not exactly sure how
it's going to look on my lips but as per
usual I will try on all of these
products at the end of this video so
yeah I am loving boxycharm I will put
the boxycharm website down below if you
want to check it out and if you want to
subscribe I think you should check it
out just check it out so yeah if you
want to see some of these products in
action then just stay tuned okay so I'm
going to try out the appeal Cosmetics
lipstick because I've been excited to
put this on my lips since I saw it look
at this color how crazy
holy cow okay so this is the appeal
lipstick super pigmented and amazing
comes off a little bit darker on the
lips than it does in the tube but it is
gorgeous like I am loving this color I'm
going to try and fill in my lips with
the reddish lip liner even though these
wooden lip liners aren't my favorite
let's just see how it goes on
it kind of pulls on my lips and it has
like that weird like old makeup ascent
not old makeup as in its expired but
like how old school makeup uses now if
that makes any sense
yeah
it doesn't even transfer Italy
okay I'm I guess super hard time with
this I actually really love the color so
it's a shame it's so drying I would
probably literally like pop this in the
microwave like a second and then apply
it to my lip so it could be a little bit
smoother
you could tell it is a long-lasting
product because like like barely
anything comes off but it's just hard to
apply so okay I'm going to try out the
Belle appear and loose eyeshadow I don't
know if I mentioned this it's in the
shade bubblegum I think I might have
mentioned it I'm just gonna lightly
apply this all over my lid
okay I definitely like this I really do
think it's really good um it doesn't
look like much right now but with a
little bit of fix plus this powder or
this eyeshadow it would look phenomenal
like it has a beautiful beautiful
iridescent to it I'm actually really
really loving this I didn't think I was
going to love this color as much as I do
because it does have a gold sheen to it
that I really really like it's not like
a pink color okay so I'm not going to
try on the nail polish because um I
painted my nails yesterday so I don't
want to ruin them but this is such a
pretty pretty color formula looks really
nice it doesn't look like see-through
ish or anything it looks like it would
work so yeah I really really love
boxycharm I think it's amazing so thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
