my monthly if si bag unboxing today's
video was actually going to be something
different I was going to film the
tutorial I was wearing in my lorac Pro
palette video but then this arrived in
the mail and I was like well I've got to
film that so if you are one of the
people that requested the emerald green
look I was wearing in my lorac Pro video
then stay tuned that should be coming up
sometime next week anyway let's go ahead
and open this okay so in this actual bag
I have these little cars
I don't read this one this is just a
card that says receive free shipping at
Ulta come with any bareMinerals purchase
use promo code oopsie I thought that's a
tipsy barfs but it doesn't it says ape
si bar EFS I will write the promo code
down below so you can get free shipping
if you want to buy something from
bareMinerals okay so this is what the
actual bag looks like this month I love
the color it is super super neon it like
looks cool with my nails my nails are
really neon right now anyway I always
have what's on my nails in my
description box below but yeah this bag
is so cute I really really like the bag
this month it's really pretty so this
open neat okay so the first thing I see
is this jojoba skin soother gel cream by
the brand called
lavell in biobalance out of the mall I
don't know but I guess this is like a
hand cream um with jojoba oil in it
let's just see what this feels like oh
it feels really moisturizing
oh my god I can't deal with the scent
maybe I got a bad one but mine smells
like farts mine is broken mine has a
giant hole at the top of this thing so I
mean that's not fun and this does not
smell good if you guys got this in your
FC bag let me know if yours smells
because I think I might have gotten a
bad one because this some Mel's like
dirty Dan's farts this of course is just
a sample so I'm not exactly sure how
much this would cost you but the
full-size is $21 the next thing I see in
the bag - jeez this is just coming all
sorts of messed up in my bag - today
this is a tin and SAS fabulous lip and
cheek stain by Elizabeth Mott and I have
heard of the brand Elizabeth Elizabeth
mop before because we have got in a
mascara by Elizabeth motley it's so big
mascara which is one of my favorite
mascaras so this is what it looks like
and it pretty much looks like Benetint
to me in the bottle it's like a red
bloody kind of tint and I'm pretty sure
it works the same way as like penitent
you know it's a cheek and lip stain so
it has a doe foot applicator and this is
the color it's a really intense red but
as you blend it out its sheers out to a
really pretty pinky red it's nice but
you do have to blend quickly because I
already see like do you see how it kind
of stained in the initial spot that I
put it in so you do have to work really
quickly with this this is a full-size
product and this retails for 2299 so huh
this is France ooh
and you're FC bag only cost 10 so I mean
that's good
the next thing in the bag is this
bareMinerals 5 in 1 BB advanced
performance cream eyeshadow broad
spectrum SPF 15 so what is this oh it
comes in a bunch of different colors
this is a long work color rich creamy
mineral pigment you're getting closer
and closer to me why it says long word
color it Prime's bright and smooth
and protects it says it won't budge
smudge or crease this is any color what
color okay so it doesn't say what color
it is on the bottle and I cannot find it
on this paper it's one of the brown ones
that's all I can tell you and this is a
tiny little tube but you can tell that a
little bit goes a long way it's like
it's basically a cream shadow and it's
really really really smooth and I love
the doe foot applicator it's nice and
like bendy like the applicator and this
is a really nice color it's like a topi
brown like a grey kind of brown I don't
know I think this would be a really nice
base for like smokey eyes like a smokey
Brown I look so this product obviously
isn't full-sized but the full size is
$18 the next thing in my bag is this
hang-ten dark tanning oil natural
sunscreen SPF 8 protection water
resistant for 40 minutes
and it comes with one fluid ounce and we
have gotten the brown hang ten in RFC
bag before but I have to be honest I'm
kind of over the like the sunscreens
kind of oh okay I'm just kind of over
the sunscreen II type of things in our
ape sea bags I understand that it's
summer and that's why they're sending
stuff like this and we need it you know
we need a sun protection and all that
stuff but I feel like okay feel like
some people have gotten like sunscreen
three bags in a row I don't think I have
but I've heard some people have so
anyway I like this though because this
is a tanning oil and I haven't gotten
one from Ipsy yet so let's say this
looks like okay there is no color to it
it's just a clear oil that you put on so
you can tan which I recommend putting
SPF underneath this because you don't
want to just put this because it only
has SPF 8 which isn't enough but Wow
smells amazing
this smells so good and it's paraben
free synthetic fragrance free
you of its cruelty free and it has a lot
of really good ingredients like argan
oil and all that good stuff it smells
amazing
Wow this isn't the full size but the
full size is only $11.99 so if you're
looking to get it that's pretty
affordable so yeah and then the last
thing in my bag I was so excited to get
I saw that a couple people got it and I
was like oh my god I hope I get that and
that is that ease and that is the
benefits they're real mascara I'm so
excited that I got this because I have
never tried this mascara before but I've
heard so many good things about it but
every time I went to go buy this I was
like I'm not gonna buy it because I hear
it's a pain to take off my eyelashes so
I don't want to spend $22 on it you know
whatever but now that I got this sample
in may tip see back I'm actually really
really excited to try it so if you want
to see how this looks on my lashes then
just stay tuned to the end of the video
because I will try it on but yeah so we
got the benefits they're real mascara
obviously this isn't the full size this
is the deluxe sample size but I'm pretty
sure I've seen this size at Sephora
retail for about $12 if I believe that
was everything I got in my Ipsy bag this
month looks funny with nothing in it but
overall I really like the bag this month
that wasn't too crazy about this I mean
it came broken and it smelled terrible
but I see myself using the bare minerals
little thing a lot and maybe I'll
purchase the full size if I really like
it and I'm excited for this so I mean it
was it was a pretty good bag it's only
$10 a month and it introduces you to a
lot of cool stuff so yeah if you want to
see a couple of things on my face and
just stay tuned okay so I took off my
mascara because I'm going to try out
today benefit they're real mascara but
first I'm going to try out the bare
minerals 5 in 1 BB advanced cream
eyeshadow so I'm just going to put it
towards my lash line and then blend it
whoa okay all I can say is a little goes
a very long way with this sucker okay so
yeah this feels really really nice on my
eyelid this would be a really great base
for like a smokey eye look but I noticed
that you do have to blend fast because
once it sets it sets which could be a
really good thing I took it off because
it just it looked uneven and I think it
would look better
underneath eye shadow than by itself so
it was bothering me a little bit it's
still really good I really liked it but
it's definitely something that I would
like to use underneath eye shadows not
on its own so now I'm going to try the
benefits they're real mascara
I didn't curl my lashes I probably
should but let's just let's just roll
with it
okay so this is the mascara with two
coats on each eye and I like it it's
good I probably wouldn't go out and buy
it though because it does clump up
pretty easily which typically I'm okay
with but it clumps up like quickly and
honestly I think that my Mac in extreme
dimension 3d black about the original in
extreme dimension the 3d black lash I
think it's better and it pretty much is
the same type of wand and you don't I
mean like it has the wand with like the
spiky ball at the end I'm obsessed with
this mascara and which is this is the
mascara was wearing in the beginning of
this video and I think it's just as good
or of not better but I mean it's good
but I hear it's really really hard to
take off and this one is super super
easy to take off so yeah okay so now I'm
going to try out the Elizabeth Mott tint
and sass fabulous lip and cheek stain
not gonna lie I'm a little scared I'm a
little scared because I don't like
products like this very much
Oh Lord this smells identical to
something I used to drink as a kid I
told my god is it coolie
this smells exactly like kool-aid pretty
sure it's kool-aid okay so this is the
same on my lips it's actually really
really pretty this is the kind of
product that would be really nice to
wear underneath a red lipstick so that
once your red lipstick kind of fades you
still have the red stain underneath so
that is probably what I will be using
this for I don't see myself using this
as a blush honestly because once it
dries it feels a little bit tacky and I
don't know how this would work on the
cheeks but for your amusement I'm going
to go ahead and dry it
yeah no I don't like it for the cheeks
because products like this are just so
hard to blend out and I feel like once
you dab it in a certain spot that mark
stays there even if you blend it out
quickly I don't recommend this product
for the cheeks but as you can see it is
really pretty for the lips okay guys so
