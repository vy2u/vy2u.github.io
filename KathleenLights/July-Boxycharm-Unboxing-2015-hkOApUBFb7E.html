it's upsetting me I couldn't find a
black one nobody cares
today's video is going to be my July
boxy Sherman burger see boxycharm I
always say boxy Sharon and I don't even
notice I actually wasn't going to film
today so I'm in like the makeup I've
been wearing all day it's like late
right now but I got this in the mail
today and I figured since I actually
haven't posted I've only posted one
video up this week because everything
was pre-recorded you guys know that I
was recently in California I was like
let me just sit down and film this and
get this up ASAP let's open this alright
so this is what the box looks the box
looks like this month it says summertime
radness oh it says greetings from Miami
cool cool cool cool okay so this is
inside the box
wow what is that okay let's talk about
this first this is the Oprah eyebrow
pencil it's Universal and recently
actually this has nothing to do with
this but I have all of the ofra long
lasting liquid lipsticks and they are
amazing Oprah is really underrated so
I'm actually excited to see how this
works
it's I typically like brow iza's that
are like mechanical this is just like a
regular pencil but we shall see this is
obviously full-size this is $13 okay
next thing is this this is the gorge
I'll make you look amazing daily spray
it says it's a magical leave-in
conditioning spray that will turn your
hair into the sexiest hair ever repairs
damage adds shine detangles protects
from heat and a bunch of other stuff
this is a full-sized product and this is
29.95 my smells I feel the need to smell
it oh my god
this smells like a magical coconut
escape suddenly I'm transported to
Hawaii this is by a brand called Vasanti
the Santee professional blush brush
full-size $29 this is desce for a brush
soft this actually would be a really
nice contour brush I think I'm gonna
like this
I like a brushes this size to me it's
too small for a blush brush or maybe
maybe after I wash it I like it I love
getting brushes and boxes I don't know
about you guys but I like I have so many
brushes and every time I get a brush
them like two more things left this is
the what is this MDM flow greater than
mascara greater than mascara it says for
the most intense highly pigmented black
volumizing mascara with Easy Off
formulation it does say here that it's
like $21 euro
I think euro yeah this mascara is being
introduced in the u.s. through boxycharm
and will be available for purchase for
$35 at the end of July
$35 that's like more than a Chanel
mascara isn't it me fancy healthy this
is a really beautiful looking mascara I
hope it's as good as it looks
oh it has like a fiber bristle which I
prefer mascaras like this over rubber
bristles so I'm actually really really
oh I thought it smelled good it's not
like a regular mascara I'm actually
really excited for that and then the
last thing in this box is this little
white thing and it says transparent veil
by your minerals Sweden your marrows
transparent veil sitting powder medium
full sized I don't exactly know what
that means maybe there's like three
sizes a small a medium and a bigger one
because it says medium full sized but
anyway this cost $26 which is pricey
nonetheless and porter eat my shirt one
more time
okay so this is basically like a
translucent setting powder that helps
minimize pores and stuff like that you
know like the typical HD kind of powder
let's see how it feels like normal
powder
oh my gosh no this looks actually very
very brightening I don't know if you can
tell but this probably would be better
to set under-eye concealer for that
really bright highlighted effect I'm
actually excited to try that because
it's super like brightening okay so that
is everything in my bum Cynthia the
overall value of this box was a hundred
and eighteen dollars you pay twenty one
dollars for the box every month and then
you get things in here that are worth
over a hundred dollars which is insane
most of the time 99% of the products are
full-size everything in my box is not
those full-size I'm so excited I got a
British sorry ever seemed like Charlie's
Angels movie where he like rips her hair
and he's like no so I'm actually really
excited for this month
I still smell this it smells so good
okay so yes leave me a comment down
below whether or not you liked your box
this month while your favorite product
was let's talk about the boxes thank you
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye
yes sorry okay
oh I have a package man Oh heaven I must
pause which I'm probably dead Porter
don't he's eating my dress
okay so next thing is this bridge okay
so this is basically like mica powder or
no it's not
well to what you guys know you can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
