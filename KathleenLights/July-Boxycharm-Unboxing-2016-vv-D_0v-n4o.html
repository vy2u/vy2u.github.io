my max Sherman Backson please excuse the
hair on my head my hair is so like puffy
and knotted but just gonna pretend
that's a nappy
I'll take a shot and wash my hair and
also my eyebrows you can't tell from far
or maybe you can because that's how bad
they are but I haven't plucked them and
a really long time
they look so bad but I'm actually going
right after from this video to go get my
eyebrows done and fine no I'm wearing
November from my newest collab with
colour-pop but yeah without further ado
let's get in this you know the drill
last time I got a paper cut it's not
gonna happen this time okay so this is
the box let's see
modern mer babe it's like a mermaid
theme or like sunshiny theme summery
theme first thing in the box is that
thing right here okay what's this PYT
argan oil from Morocco oil treatment I
love oil oh I just realized there's only
four products in the box as month
usually there's five right am I going
crazy
usually there's five anyway this is the
PYT hair oil treatment penetrates the
hair follicle and leaves hair for his
free prevent split and that creates
instant shine without oily residue safe
for color-treated hair this is pretty
much like argan oil and a bunch of other
things in it I'm actually going to give
this to a family member because I'm
trying to not use so much domestic Kona
in my hair and this has the methadone in
it which is not terrible but I hate it
for my curly hair because I kind of feel
like it weighs down my curls this would
definitely work for someone else so I'm
gonna put this little sign for a friend
of mine this is a full-size product in
this retails for $30 okay nesting in de
box yeah this this is a figure it out
before looking at the card but this is
from a brand con oh yeah I want to say
Noah lipgloss oh it's a lip gloss in the
shade Malbec I'm like very until it WA
right now oh how pretty look at this
packaging wow that is beautiful this is
a full-size product and this retails for
$16 it says a natural lip gloss made
without sulfates parabens
or sow it salads and the packaging is
composed of earth-friendly bamboo that
is awesome
the color of this is really pretty it's
like a berry shade really really nice
there's a lot of shine to that as well
I'm just really into this packaging like
so much I feel like this video is going
by so fast because there's only four
things but we're almost done next thing
in the Box is this malli ever color
style star light waterproof liner
I love malli they sell it at Ulta it's
it's a high-end brand so that's awesome
that this is in the box this is a
full-size eyeliner and it is $18 here's
a mess and this color is beautiful
so so beautiful look at that look how
pretty it's like a nice icy blue doesn't
really go with my look right now so I'm
not going to apply it to my waterline
cuz I really have to go to my eyebrow
appointment right now but this would be
so cool like poolside you know I really
like that color and it's waterproof I
mean I haven't tested it but that would
be cool let me know if you guys want to
see this in a tutorial maybe I'll use
that in like a waterproof video because
I've actually been wanting to do like a
waterproof makeup test it under water
kind of thing my mom has a pool so I
want to like do my whole face and then
just like jump in the pool and record
the whole thing let me know if that's
something you would be interested in and
maybe I'll put that little blue eyeliner
to the test okay and so the last thing
in the Box is like just hanging at the
bottom here like a Z palette so many of
these little worms oh wait there's
eyeshadows in this okay okay this is a
Oprah professional magnetic palette it's
from Oprah I love Oprah you know
okay it has eyeshadows in it
house-trained what is this this
professional magnetic palette made
exclusively for boxycharm comes equipped
with a mix of six shimmer and matte
eyeshadows that normally retail for $10
each pan whoa
this versatile formula can be applied
dry for subtle shading or damp for more
intense color so this is full-size or
like Knuffle size this whole thing
here is a $60 value $59 value assessment
which I'm assuming is why there are only
four products in the box this month
usually there are five but that's
probably because this and the single
shadows kind of form as one but let's
see the pigmentation nice I love this
color right here really really pretty oh
I love this song
look at that shimmer because I am going
somewhere now I'm not gonna film myself
putting this on but I will probably
insert a demo applying all of these
products at the end of this video I'll
probably film that when I get back
awesome actually really like this you
can apply other single eyeshadows you
have I think this is awesome for those
of you who have a ton of single
eyeshadows like at home and you don't
know what to do with them you could just
pop them in your little Oprah palette
that you get in your box this month so
yeah totally totally into this idea I
love that they included this I feel like
that's a really great product to put in
a subscription box so that was
everything I got in this month's
boxycharm and with there only being four
products the valley was so over a
hundred and twenty dollars which is
phenomenal I will have boxycharm listed
below as always they now ship to Canada
which is really cool so yeah that
completes this video I always feel like
these in boxing videos are so short but
yeah let me know what you thought of the
box this month did you like it did you
think it was like whatever let me know
down below but that completes this video
guys thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
did my eyebrows
what a different tongue from this clip
to the other one
you
