Malbecs sherman bucks you guys already
know how these videos work which is why
I only have foundation and concealer on
so without further ado let's just open
this bad boy all right so this is what
the box looks like this month this is
the card it says cutie pie
and I'm not going to lie I open this box
earlier I already know about the blink
palette because boxycharm had sent me
one to test out and just to see if I
thought the colors were good which they
are but I'm sure you guys saw my post on
Instagram but anyway besides that I was
looking for the box this month looks
really good like really good let's get
started
so the first thing in the Box is this
and it's so funny because I actually
owned this before this is the
bareMinerals invisible light translucent
powder duo I used to have this but I
ended up giving one to a friend a while
ago and I don't remember why but I
remember really liking this at one point
you get like the two powders I'm so
excited bare minerals in the box like
that is so cool and you get a matte
version and a glow version they are very
very white powders but have a silky
formula to where not a lot of products
really comes up in the glow shade is
kind of like an ambient lighting powder
to where it has a soft Sheen nothing too
intense so today I'm just going to set
my under eyes with the matte side and
then I'm going to highlight my face with
the glow side okay so I already applied
my concealer
let me just retouch this so that there
are no creases alright so I'm going to
take the met side with my do displace
tapered powder brush and I'm just going
to set my under eye concealer it kind of
looks like your skin has a little bit of
a filter on it and I love powders like
this it's very similar to the NARS
translucent crystal powder or like the
pressed one I mean very similar to that
I remember really liking this why did I
give mine away I don't know maybe I
wasn't too crazy up pricy my Cuban came
out maybe I wasn't too crazy about the
glow side so we shall see in a second
I'm just going to set my concealer and
I'm also going to set the rest of my
face kind of because the foundation I
put on is a little
a bit tacky okay so really quickly
off-camera I'm going to apply my bronzer
and my blush so I can highlight now I'm
going to take the glow side I kind of
have a tan on right now from being in
the pool this weekend so I have a
feeling this might look a little bit too
like for me like a little too light I
remember this being extremely subtle
though to me this is more of like an
all-over face powder you can totally use
this on your entire face I think it
looks good on the nose it's like a very
subtle little book this is perfect for
those of you who really do not like an
intense highlight and you're kind of
like light to fair skin this is perfect
because it's so subtle on the top of the
cheek but it looks so pretty and natural
I'm going to take a brush I'll take this
brush and I'm just going to dust this
like on my face actually I'm going to
put your brush and I'm going to take the
go outside and just like glow up my
entire face just so we can see how that
looks okay so I totally see the
difference I made on my skin applying it
to my entire face kind of gave me like a
turtle like a subtle sheen to the skin I
don't know if you can see it but I could
totally see it in person I don't know
how this would work for those of you
with medium to deep skin tones
if you fall under that category and you
have tried this let me know if this
worked for you or if it's too light
leave it in the comments below I'd love
to know how this works for everyone okay
so next thing in the Box is this day
this is from the brand blink and they
collab I'm super nervous I'm assuming
they did collab with boxycharm obviously
the pallets is boxycharm and this is the
electric eyes palette and you get five
really pigmented creamy like metallic
shades mostly bronze colors and then you
get like this pop of cranberries that I
really like but they are extremely
pigmented let me swatch them for you
actually let me put this away because
I'm going to save this one for my friend
because I have mine right here so they
are super pigmented just look at this
look at this look at think it is amazing
look at that pygmy oh my gosh and I
could even do it like for a second look
at that look at that
like so gorgeous so buttery ultra smooth
oh my gosh so pigmented like extremely
metallic the only thing about this
palette is that obviously everything is
really metallic so you don't have any
transition shades or other matte colors
so you will have to dabble into another
palette to get a full look but I think
this is perfect to take this and like an
all matte palette and then you have
everything you need I'm going to do a
simple look using one of these shades
just so you can see it all over the lid
I'm going to dabble into my zoeva matte
palette to use the matte shades you guys
really quickly I'm just going to be
applying some of these crease colors on
my eyes I think I'm going to use this
really pretty rose gold one this one's
like my favorite I really like the
bronze colors too but this is gorgeous
I love this color now I'm just going to
add some matte shadows in the crease so
that there are no harsh lines for my
lower lash line I'm going to run this
deeper bronze color these two are very
similar only this one has more of a gold
undertone and this one is a little bit
more chocolate I'm going to run that on
my lower lash line I'm going to take
this crease shade I used from these away
palette and I'm just going to buff that
underneath and mix it in with that
chocolate shade so it looks a little
more smoky and less shimmery I'm
highlighting my brow bone with a matte
shade with a light matte shade and then
for my inner corner highlight I'm going
to take the lightest color in this
palette and I'm going to pop that right
here obviously this is so intense this
reminds me of math nylon in the sense
that like it's extremely intense okay so
now that we're all ready here I noticed
there's an eye liner in the box this
month at least that's what I think this
is oh it's not okay this is a unibrow
Universal eyebrow pencil oh my gosh I
hadn't even taken the cops off I thought
this was an eyeliner okay it's an
eyebrow pencil I always open the box the
day I filmed the video but I opened it
earlier just to look through everything
so I know what makeup to put on and what
makeup not to put on and I just looked
at this and assumed it was a liquid
liner like I really did that's okay we
will wipe one off but I'm just going to
go ahead and apply some mascara and I
will be right back okay now that the
eyes are completely done we can move on
to the eyebrows so this is from the
brand Winky looks I could have sworn
we've gotten things from this brand
before in the past I'm pretty sure so
there are no specific shades it's just a
universal shade for everyone I have a
feeling I'm going to have to browse two
totally different colors
this has one of those angled tips and I
have to be honest when this first came
out like I think honest hacia was the
first brow pen so I tried like this I
was all about it I was loving the shape
of these but now I prefer the regular
brow is the regular pencil I'm not
really feeling these angled tips anymore
and I don't know why sometimes I'm like
that this is not bad I like how it
turned out but I do think it's a little
bit harsh like I don't explain it it's
not as creamy as I would want it to be
but it's not necessarily waxy either it
just feels a little rough like I wasn't
even pressing down that hard and I feel
like the strokes just like showed up
harsh on my skin or on my brows but it
suddenly has the worst brow pen so I've
used but based on first impressions it's
not my favorite all right so this is the
next thing in the box and I am so
excited for this if you guys know me you
know I love setting sprays I love trying
out setting sprays I don't know why I
like bottles Alec's price this is the
project beauty spray set go makeup
setting spray oh my gosh I haven't told
you prices of anything literally
anything what am I doing with my life I
am so sorry I haven't had coffee today
at all i sat down to film this as soon
as I woke up and forgive me
this is full size of course and this
retails from $32 this is also full size
and this retails for $45 which is a bit
pricey but the shadows are so good and
the brow pencil is also full size and
this is $12 and I'm not sure if this is
full size I can't really sell because
some setting sprays are this small like
the Milani one so I'm not sure but I'm
going to assume it is and this is $32
and we are going to test this bad boy
out hopefully this spritz is good lifti
okay so it doesn't shoot out as a very
fine mist the setting sprays I prefer
are the ones that sound like you don't
mean because those tend to be a little
bit more misty this one's a little more
like
hi everybody I don't know how to explain
it but the Miss isn't bad like I've
definitely used worse the Milani one has
a better like more fine mist I love that
one
this one's alright but if it really does
extend my makeup then but anyway I like
how that made my skin look kind of took
away the powder eNOS if something has to
play around with a little bit more so I
have other settings braids that I prefer
to apply probably but I'm going to play
around with it and we'll see okay and
then last but certainly not least I got
so excited when I open the box there's a
color pop product in here and it is an
ultra satin lip which is my favorite
product color pop has out of everything
they make even their eyeshadows they're
ultra satin lips are the best they're my
favorite and this is from their Hello
Kitty collection which i think is really
cute and this one's called hello pretty
and it is a really intense berry cooler
so I already know this is amazing I
actually don't think I have this color
I'm pretty sure when I got the Hello
Kitty collection I gave most of it to my
little cousin hold up so kitty there's
my full-size by the way and this retails
for $6
how pretty is this color I'm sure I have
a hundred colors in my collection
Millicent this stuff I think this color
would look beautiful on pretty much
every single skin tone okay guys so that
completes this video this was everything
I got in my bucks a share I really like
the box this month the only two things
I'm like I don't know if I like are the
setting spray and the eyebrow product
and mainly this this I actually think I
might end up liking mist is a little
Spiti but not as bad as a lot of other
setting sprays I have in that collection
so this one's pretty good the only one
that I'm liking is this didn't really
love it but I loved everything else so
I'm really impressed I really love this
month let me know down below if you like
the box this month what did you think of
it did you love it you hate it leave it
