my July favorites video it's just they
things I've really been loving this
month and I have very very little to
talk about which sucks I almost didn't
make a favorites video for this month
just because it's so little I didn't
really do a whole lot of shopping this
month at all actually
last month I did which is why I had a
ton of stuff to show you last month but
this month not so much but whatever let
me just get started so the first thing I
want to talk about is this little guy
right here I've had him for like two
months him it's a boy
I found the Beautyblender for like two
months now and I really really love this
it's just this big and then you run it
under water like your sink and then you
just like squish it squish it out and it
expands and you use it damn that's how
you get like the best application of
your foundation when it's wet and
honestly it's a little shocking how well
this puts on your foundation especially
if you have really thick foundations and
you feel like kind of looks like a mask
and it just looks really unnatural get
the Beauty Blender it it makes your face
look flawless no matter how thick your
foundation and I know it's expensive but
honestly to me it's a hundred percent
worth it nothing puts on my foundation
like this does for example these two
match made in heaven
okay my next favorite is also something
I use to put on my foundation and it is
my Real Techniques buffing brush now I
love my Beauty Blender but I always wash
it right after I'm done using it just so
that I can prolong the life of it I
don't want it to like sit there and get
stained and stuff like that so I always
wash it after I'm done using it but when
I'm in a hurry that I have to sit down
and just I don't have time to like what
a sponge I have to throw something on my
face because I'm in a hurry
this is my foundation brush of choice
now I love this I know that everyone
loves the expert face brush from Real
Techniques but honestly I do like it I
do think it's a really good brush to put
on your foundation but sometimes it can
a little bit of streak marks for me I
don't know if anybody else has that
problem with this brush but that happens
to me sometimes the buffing brush that
never happens I think it's because it's
such a soft brush it's not as dense and
when you like really work it into your
skin it really does and buffs the
foundation into your skin and it's a
buffing brush so I guess but it does it
buffs the crap out of the foundation and
it looks really really nice
I puts on my foundation a lot nicer than
this one and I love it I use this for my
foundation I use it to like smooth out
my concealer I use this to contour I use
this to put on my highlight I use this
for everything this can do everything I
can show you if you don't believe me
that I could do my whole face with this
brush it's amazing ok so the next thing
I want to talk about it's kind of stupid
but I really really love this it's the
chapstick and the cake batter flavor I
mean really look up first of all look
how cute this is with all these pretty
little baby rainbow colors it's just
it's nice to look at right know maybe
anyway this has been like my chapstick
of choice all month I have been using it
non-stop and I have the feeling that I
am literally gonna go through this whole
thing and I never go through chopsticks
it's that good it smells like cake
batter like you put on your lips and you
just want to like eat your lips it's so
good and I never really buy chopsticks
from the chapstick brand I'm more like a
ballistics kind of girl but for a simple
everyday chopstick like throw in your
purse timeit's chapstick this is awesome
I had a cut on my lip not so long ago
and when it was healing I used to put
this on every single day and it made my
lips feel amazing I love this little
cake batter thing it's so cute and yummy
okay so my newest obsession it is the
Stila in the light palette this has been
my go-to palette recently it just has
these beautiful colors that you know are
up my alley I just I love the colors in
this palette and I've actually been
using Khitan as a highlight of
recently I like to highlight my
cheekbones and in my orange eyes
tutorial I used bubbly as my highlight
is just like a very light gold so I have
been using this a ton not just on my
eyes obviously and it's not super
expensive
I mean it's pricey but for example The
Naked palette is fifty dollars and this
is 39 so if you're looking and investing
in a really good palette but don't want
to pay the fifty bucks for the naked one
pick this up because it has like the
similar vibe as the Naked palette and
it's 11 dollars cheaper and the quality
of these eyeshadows are amazing amazing
quality I have a tutorial up using this
so you can go check it out and I'm also
gonna be doing another look with this
palette just because I think this
palette is completely awesome okay and
my last Beauty favorite of the month is
the NYX butter gloss in creme brulee I'm
pretty sure that I use this in like my
last two videos where I'm like doing my
makeup like the last two tutorials i
have up i can't get enough of this it
smells like frosting like it smells so
delicious and it's not sticky this has
converted me if you know me you know
that i never ever wear lip gloss i'm not
one of those people who puts on a
lipstick and then i'll put a gloss on
top like every time i never did that but
ever since i bought this i have been
doing that recently like i'll put on the
lipstick and just like topping it off
with this makes it look so nice and
glossy and i just like using this on top
of like pink lipsticks to just give it
more like a milky kind of look cuz this
is a very pretty let me swatch it maybe
they'll be smart okay this is a swatch
of it see it's like a very like milky
type of pink and it looks nice on top of
other like pink lipsticks and it is
really really opaque like i use this all
the time on its own i'll just throw it
in my purse and then go somewhere forget
to wear lipstick and just pop this on my
lips and it looks like nice and opaque
and it's just it's just a great lip
gloss this is the only one that i own i
want to go and get some more but i
haven't because i don't know what i
don't know what i haven't gone to pick
up some more
I really love this thing okay so those
are all my beauty favorites these are
just the things I've been reaching for
the most recently but really quickly I
need to tell you my newest obsession
something that has taken over my life
completely even though this is a beauty
favorites video I'm just gonna add a
random favor in because why not okay I
am obsessed with Tru Blood like this
whole month has been the Tru Blood month
for me I saw like season 1 through 5 on
my iPad and it was like everyday like I
could not stop watching it every day I
was sitting there on my iPad and
watching episode after episode after
episode then II thought I had lost my
mind so I'm officially all caught up and
now I watch it with the rest of the
world on Sunday night I wasn't too crazy
about the first two seasons they were
good but they weren't like nothing out
of this world but as the seasons went on
the show gets so so good like right now
the show is so good it can be a little
uncomfortable to watch sometimes cuz
it's like rated R if you know what I
mean some parts you're like oh little
awkward to watch but I think that the
storyline is so good and it's getting
better and better and it keeps you on
your toes like there's so many episodes
around my in the episode ends and you
just have to watch the next one if you
watch this show
I am team Eric now I was team Bill for
the longest time but
season four just completely converted me
and I'm an Erica lever now and I don't
know if anything will ever change that
if you don't know I'm here talking for
hours about a show but if you don't know
it's a show about vampires like mediums
and wolves and shifters and it's very
supernatural but very very good I
totally recommend that show if you
haven't seen it it's on HBO it's a
little naughty a little naughty so I
mean I would definitely take that into
consideration it's not for everyone but
it's really good okay so that's it those
were all my favorites for the month I
had to throw in a little random favorite
just because it is something I obsessed
over the month of June sorry I just had
to throw it in there but anyway guys
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video
