my July my July favorites these are
products I have really been loving in
the month of July and I have so many
things talk to you about that I'm just
gonna get started I'm not gonna ramble
like usual this is the Mac prep and
prime 24 hour extended eye base this is
an eyeshadow primer this is the best
eyeshadow primer I have ever used in my
entire life and that is that's a crazy
statement because I am obsessed with the
Mac painterly Paint Pot and that's still
my all-time favorite but they're
different I love them both for different
reasons let me explain really quick
because I sound crazy
I love painterly because it does make my
eyeshadows last all day but it conceals
everything on my lid because it's like a
flesh tone color this is completely
clear which I typically don't love clear
primers I always put a clear primer on
top and then follow up with like a skin
tone base kind of thing but this is
unreal I'm used to using the shadow
insurance by Too Faced the Urban Decay
primer potion and all that they don't
hold a candle to this this is amazing I
was actually telling my sister about it
the other day I had this on the entire
day I wore this early in the morning and
I didn't take off my makeup till later
that night and my eyeshadows were glued
to my eyelids I actually struggled to
take them off not struggled like
waterproof kind of struggle but I was
like rubbing my eye there for a little
bit longer than I usually do I was just
blown away this prevents creasing to its
fullest potential and it just it's like
glue this is like a glue for your
eyeshadow it's amazing if you haven't
tried it please do so best colorless eye
primer I have ever used
hands down okay so I really want to give
a quick shout out to the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara this has
become one of my favorite drugstore
mascaras ever it is the mascara I am
wearing right now I love it and I feel
like I don't even need to curl my lashes
want to
they're not curled right now I do
sometimes but most of the time it just
does the work for me it's not super
super thickening but I find that if you
do use like three coats it can get
pretty thick and volumizing I love the
look it gives my eyelashes they look
almost like very very very very natural
falsies if that makes any sense maybe
not but that's just how I feel okay so
something I'm pretty sure you guys all
knew was going to be in this video you
guys know this is the Jaclyn hill
highlight that she created in
collaboration with Becca it is in the
shade champagne pop I'm pretty sure you
can still get your hands on this I'm not
exactly sure but I think so this is such
a stunning highlight and again I've said
this recently I'm not only saying that
because it's Jacqueline Hill and I love
Jaclyn hill but it's a beautiful
beautiful shade of like a champagne
peachy gold it looks stunning on every
skin tone I feel very fair-skinned can
wear it and then deeper skins can wear
it deeper skin tones can wear it too
it's beautiful and honestly it's the
exact same quality as all the other
Becca highlights which are probably one
of the best highlight formulations on
the market today is salut I just wanted
to give it a shout-out because I have
been using a non-stop I even she did
send this to me but I purchased a backup
for myself and then I purchased one for
my best friend Amelia because she was
dying for it and I was just and I bought
it for her because I think everybody
needs it like because it's so good I do
want to mention another highlight though
that I have been using in conjunction
with this like not together but whenever
I'm not using that one I am using this
one this is the Natasha's anona glow all
over face and body shimmer powder I have
mine in zero one light I actually filmed
a video using a lot of a Natasha Danone
of products and that video should be
coming up soon like in a few days but
this to me was this the packaging is so
pretty but it gets like fingerprint e
this to me was the star of the show this
I have come to the realization that
these types of highlights are the ones
that look the best on me the ones that
look
Perley or a little bit more white that
they make your cheeks look wet does that
make sense not so much a gold not so
much the laura geller gilded honey but
more like pearly shades i like how they
look on my skintone when i'm more fair I
feel like I might be more fair these
days anyway this is the highlight I am
currently wearing on my face I do have
something underneath it and I'm actually
just going to show you might as well but
anyway this is the highlight that's on
my face it is stunning I have it on my
inner corners I have it on my brow bone
it is so beautiful it makes your cheeks
look wet and shimmery and beautiful
there's no glitter it's just stunning I
love it I freaking love it it's so good
those two highlights have definitely
been my favorite this month and this guy
surprised me I know that this is a lot
of highlighting stuff but I mean it's
with all this strobing going around we
just like highlighting these days more
than ever this is something that shocked
me completely if you saw my fame expo
hall you saw that I bought three of
these these are these you a cream
highlights and I bought a set of three
one was a champagne peachy color which I
actually have on my eyelid to have the
cream highlight and champagne on my
eyelid then there was one that was gold
that's everyone's favorite that one's
called like tre and then this one is
camellia I'm gonna call it camellia
camellia cavea
yeah and the one that I thought I was
gonna like the least is the one that I
ended up loving the most because if you
look at it it's like white it is a pearl
highlight it makes your cheeks look so
like wet looking I don't know it's
beautiful a little bit goes a very very
long way I try to use a light hand with
this it's very similar to Mac's pearl
highlight but Mac's pearl is a lot more
golden it has like a stronger gold
undertone this one just looks like
pearly it's beautiful so it is what I
have underneath this highlight right
here and yeah these lasts forever
because they're cream they give you that
wet face look äj-- I love it these have
been amazing and they're from the
drugstore these are the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi liquid glow illuminator
Prime and highlight so you can use this
as a face primer like you put this on
your entire face to prime kind of and
then put your makeup on top and your
face will just look like overall glowy
or you can use this mixed in with your
foundation to give your foundation more
of a radiant not so matte look or you
can just use it by itself on the top of
the cheekbones I've used them every
single way and every single way I love
them my favorite one I'm not going to
lie is golden
this one is rose this one's a little bit
more pink I love the golden one I have
used this as a face primer and it's
stunning I don't know if it prolongs
wear of my makeup but it just makes my
makeup on top look really nice you guys
know I did not like I'm borderline hated
borderline hated I don't like to use
that word but I borderline hated the
powder versions of this like their new
collection the powders are chalky chunky
super sparkly they make they emphasize
my pores so badly I didn't like them at
all but these liquid ones are really
really nice probably my favorite liquid
illuminators from the drugstore that I
have come across I would get my hands on
them fre because they are really good
and really this blew me away this is
something that I didn't think I was
going to love as much as I did and I had
done research on it for days and days
and days because it's a pricey product
and I didn't want to spend my money on
it unless it was good but it had rave
reviews
so I'm went out and bought it this is
stunning number one this is the
Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish skin perfecting micro powder I
have mine in the shade medium I will say
the color selection kind of sucks
because she has light medium and dark
and that's pretty ridiculous because
there are not only three skin tones in
the world so I wish she would come out
with a bunch of different shades kind of
like Mac mineralize skinfinish --is they
have like medium plus and medium deep
and stuff like that
notes Hilary needs to expand the color
selection on this because this is the
best powder I have ever used in my
entire life and that's saying a lot
because the matte
mineralize skinfinish the mirror i skip
finished natural soap they're called
that was my favorite powder because it
was the only powder that didn't look
chalky on my skin because I say this in
every video you guys must be really sick
of it but I have very dry skin
I hate powders you guys sometimes see I
don't powder my foundation unless I
absolutely have to by the way quick side
note would you guys like me to film a
video on best powders for a dry skin I
have come across very few but I have
come across some powders that look
really nice on my skin and don't
emphasize my flaky dry skin so if you
guys want to see I'm an itch if you guys
want to see best powders for dry skin
let me know in the comments anyway so
yes like I was saying this is the best
powder I have ever used this makes my
skin look airbrushed I put it on my face
and it mattifies me in the most natural
way possible like if I'm a little bit
too dewy
which I'm very doing right now but I'm
feeling it if I'm a little bit too dewy
I will just dust this on the places
where I no longer want to be doing and
it mattifies instantly but it doesn't
look like I have powder on at all I can
put this on my entire face pack it on
and it does not look like I am wearing
powder but it does what it's supposed to
do you know another powder that I want
to mention because I'm shocked at how
much I'm you I've been using it it's a
NYX HD finishing powder and this one is
in the shade banana they do have
different shades but this one is my
favorite I have been using this to set
my under eye concealer and you guys know
that my holy grail drugstore powder
front of my eyes is the Mac no it's the
Maybelline fit me in 1/35 creamy natural
but I really have been using this
especially when my skin is a little bit
more tan I find that the yellow powder
kind of sets and brightens a little bit
better actually the other one brightens
more but when I have a tan I really like
this shade it just does a really nice
job of smoothing out your under-eye
concealer to help it from creasing it's
a nice nice powder so I really have been
loving banana HD powder it's good and
I'm pretty sure that that powder is in
the NYX contour kit which is also a
really good product so if you guys know
me if you guys know I love the
maybelline creamy matte
six they're probably my favorite matte
lipsticks from the drugstore and they
came out with some new shades recently
and these two have been my all-time
favorite Porter is licking my toes
I have clay crush and nude nuance new
nuance I hope I'm saying that right this
is what nude nuance looks like this is
actually very very similar to Mac's
world this color is very in right now
everybody has been loving colors like
this and I highly recommend you check
this lipstick out because if you're into
these kinds of shapes like Mac whirl and
stuff like that you will love nude new
ones and the formula that these are
amazing amazing amazing lipsticks and my
favorite one has been clay crush this is
a similar cutter cutter similar color
but a lot more peachy in like its
undertone it just is like a nice brown
peachy nude it's so so pretty I've been
wearing this one more of a on a daily
kind of thing like very minimal make-up
and I just throw that on my lips so I've
really really been loving those
lipsticks okay so I want to mention two
brushes one is like barely a brush but
whatever this is the Sedona lace 217 I
have gotten lots of questions about this
you guys see me use this all the time
this was sent to me by a subscriber and
once I started using it it's like I need
to buy ten of these I use this in almost
all my videos to blend out my concealer
I would put my concealer underneath my
eyes and then just blend it away and
it's the perfect size to get right
underneath my eyes and it's the perfect
density so easy to blend out concealer
if you guys want a brush for underneath
your eyes this one is amazing Holy Grail
for sure I use it all the time so so
don't lace 217 you ma besties and then I
also wanted to mention this guy right
here this is the morphe b71
this looks like a mascara comb I mean
like a mascara comer or I mean like an
eyebrow you know you've seen these kind
of brushes before so whenever I apply
falsies on my eyes I always put my scare
on first I don't like to put mascara
on top of them because then I can't use
them as many times as I want to so I
like to put on my scare first and then
put my fuzzies on my falsies on top and
sometimes they'll like stick together
and things will get a little bit weird
looking so I love using this to comb out
my falsies and mix them in with my
natural lashes and it's amazing for that
and also which happens to me a lot which
is what I use it for the most sometimes
I go a little bit heavy-handed on the
mascara I'm not going to lie like I go
ham on my mascara I do like three coats
and it gets pretty clumpy all I have to
do is brush this through my eyelashes
and Maya has our 100% clump free I love
this little guy I take it with me to
travel with it's just my new favorite
little gadget I love it to continue on
with morpheme I just want to show you
this thing this is the morphe brushes 35
t palette I have a tutorial using this
coming up very soon I posted this on
snapchat and I show you guys swatches I
was completely blown away when I got it
it looks like just a basic boring bland
palette but it is absolutely not you can
tell in the swatches it's freaking
amazing in the tutorial that I'm going
to post you will see the colors are so
pigmented so fantastic I love everything
about this palette probably one of the
best morphe palettes that they have come
out with it's very rose tone so if you
like those bronzy colors that are very
rosy this is your guy I love it and it's
inexpensive so yeah I do have a 10% off
coupon code for morphe it is an
affiliate code but if you're not
comfortable with that just go to morphe
brushes calm but you can save 10% off
with my code i just i've really
genuinely been loving that palette all
right let's move on this has been the
ultimate lip liner guys this lip liner
is fantastic I need you guys to pause
this video and go buy this lip liner
right now
this is Milani color statement lip liner
true instant color long-wearing easy
glide formula and it is in the shade
spice this is like a dupe for Mac's
spice and so much cheaper it's crazy
this is such a stunning color
stunning I love using this to fill my
entire lips with it and it's just it's
perfect it's those colors that are very
very popular right now you know spice
world all that stuff but Milani has one
and it's so much cheaper and it's this
lip liner is so freakin good I can't and
it's actually very creamy considering
it's a wooden a wooden one it's creamier
than the Mac wooden ones so that's
saying something
okay so I have been using this primer
like crazy all month it's probably the
primer i've been using the most it's the
Laura Mercier foundation primer in the
shade radiance
it's the primer I wore underneath my
makeup today by the way I used the
makeup for ever ultra low matte what no
you make it forever
Ultra HD and I have been loving it it's
amazing but anyway I just recently got
it so I don't want to talk about it that
much man this primer is amazing because
it does prolong my makeup it leaves my
makeup in place all day but it gives me
the dualist most beautiful looking
makeup it's I can't say enough good
things it's like a champagne color with
a little bit of gold it's not that
pearly color like Mac strobe cream but
it's so it's so beautiful I just love
how it makes my face look such a great
primer you go Laura Mercier I love you
so this concealer I'm wearing right now
and the concealer I'm wearing a lot
surprisingly is the maybelline superstay
better skin concealer supposedly it's
going to make your skin better over time
and I don't know if that's true but I've
been using it a lot so hopefully it
works I have mine in ivory I love it
it's so lightweight if I set it
immediately it does increase it doesn't
have full coverage like I would want so
this is not the kind of concealer I will
wear at night time to go out because I
really want like I'm more flawless look
under my face but under my eyes but for
an everyday concealer this is amazing
lightweight blends beautifully doesn't
irritate under my eyes
give me white bumps it's really really
nice and I highly recommend you check it
out especially on just regular light
makeup kind of days this has been
everything to me guys this is the pink
beach nights hair and body mist I use
this mostly on my hair because it makes
my hair smells so good too much it's
such a light beachy scent like your hat
I don't know I really really love how
this smells if you can go into pink like
the Victoria Secret pink and find it I
would recommend it pick it up smell it
it smells so good I get compliments
every time I wear it it's just been it's
been a good one for me okay so let's
talk about what's on my lips right now
these are the ofra long lasting liquid
lipsticks and nice when I tell you that
these are one of the best liquid
lipsticks I have ever used in my life
I'm not freaking kidding they are so
good these are amazing I am currently
wearing REO right now my cups it's a
beautiful peach it's amazing these are a
moosie texture but they're not thick I
don't love really moosie liquid
lipsticks because to me they just don't
last yeah they're a little bit more
hydrating but they don't last on my lips
at all these have a slight moosie
texture but not super thick so they
don't dry out my lips but they do
actually last a long time so I get the
best of both worlds with these I love
Oprah liquid lipsticks definitely check
them out another one I really love is
South Paulo
and yeah oh I love them all they're all
really good okay guys so that completes
this video these my dogs are barking
