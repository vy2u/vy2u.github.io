my July favorites I'm basically gonna be
telling you guys everything I've been
loving in July I don't have just makeup
products I have other kind of beauty
products as well and yeah let's get into
it
my first favorite totally surprised me
when I first bought it I didn't think it
was gonna be nearly as good as it is I
had no idea I was gonna love this so
much and it is from the brand essence I
got this at Ulta and it is their pure
nude highlighter I was just shopping
around the what's new section at Ulta I
also like to hang out there a lot and
even though it looked like nothing on
the website I thought I would give it a
shot and it even looks like nothing in
the pan it almost looks like a face
powder that's close to my skin tone but
on the face it translates completely
different like not even just watching it
on the back of your hand does it look
pretty
it looks so basic swatched and kind of
like nothing like literally a face
powder but when you apply this to your
face it transforms it's the highlight
I'm wearing on my face right now it
looks so so natural but you look glowy
but it doesn't emphasize the texture on
your skin and it doesn't look too
metallic I know that right now that's
really on trend like an ultra metallic
beaming highlight but sometimes I don't
think that looks that good I like it but
I don't like it for day-to-day I like
something like this for a day to day but
that's just me I have just really really
been loving this definitely a hidden gem
at Ulta okay so my next product you guys
knew it was coming I'm gonna pause for a
second take a wild guess it's something
I've been raving about I'm obsessed with
the Tarte shaped ape concealers these
are amazing it's exclusive to Ulta I
don't know why but it is you can only
get this concealer Ulta I'm hoping they
expand to like Sephora's and all that
I'm gonna go ahead and say it I have
discovered my all-time favorite
concealer right here last month I spoke
about the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer I was loving it last month and
I still like it now when I'm not using
this one I'm pretty much using the Too
Faced one and I just love how dewy and
fresh that concealer feels underneath my
eyes
the one concealer I travel with no
matter where I go my travel buddy is my
NARS radiant creamy concealer it's the
it's pretty much my favorite I use that
one off-camera more than I use any other
one I love the coverage I just love
everything about it but I like this one
even more than that that is a huge
statement I think this one blows the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer out of
the water and that concealer is
phenomenal so I don't know this has
really really full coverage but it isn't
cakey it doesn't look super drying under
my eyes but it still dries matte it's a
matte full coverage concealer which I
never thought I would love so much but
it looks flawless and the best part is
okay out of all the concealers I've ever
tried this one creases the least out of
all of them don't get me wrong I always
set my concealer no matter what
concealer it is but you can get away
with not setting this yeah the only
thing I don't love about this concealer
is the shade range I think they need to
come out with more colors because there
are jumps like in between shades like
right now I'm wearing the shade fair and
light/medium both mixed they're amazing
I was sent two of them and then I bought
all of them like I bought all of them
when I tried out the two that they sent
me because they're so good I cannot
recommend a concealer enough so some of
you may have noticed but I've only been
wearing three lip colors all month
pretty much and that is my new
collection with color pop these are the
only lip products I've been wearing I
love mixing these three colors right now
I am wearing point zero on my lips did I
even say what these words these are the
colour-pop ultra satin lip sizz the trio
i just recently released like in
collaboration with color pop I'm wearing
point zero right now it's a really
pretty cool tone Brown I love this shade
the one I wear the most is probably
November it's like a pinky rosy coral
shade so pretty and then Alyssa is like
a day-to-day go-to color for sure
I love the formula on the ultra satin
lips they are not drying whatsoever but
they stay on your lips and they last a
really long time they do transfer like
if you see like they do transfer but
that doesn't really bother me and it's
like a nice satin finish love these love
these colors I will have that linked
below as usual
and I've also been wearing of course my
mr. Bing eyeliner also my collaboration
with colla pop this is the creme gel
liner it's just a warm brown eyeliner
it's what I have on my eyes right now
this is the only thing on my eyes today
just I mean like concealer and powder to
cover up my veins and stuff but I tight
line with this I applied it to my
waterline and then I kind of smudged it
on my top lashes and on my bottom lashes
as well to create kind of like a smoky
liner I love how this looks on green
eyes blue eyes hazel eyes I think it
really makes your eye color pop no
matter what eye color you have but I
love the warm undertone and mr. Bing and
I have been wearing it so much of course
okay moving on so I never really loved
using gel eyeliners and pot like I used
to love it when I first started my
channel but then I just got used to
using liquid liner like in a pen like
the Kat Von D tattoo liner I just felt
like I never had a lot of control with
applying my wing with a brush I never
found the perfect brush but I finally
did I finally have discovered my
favorite winged eyeliner brush and now
I'm using like my Inglot gel eyeliner
and number 77 all the time and I'm not
struggling anymore like I love this
brush it makes winged eyeliner so easy
to do this is the Anastacio beverly
hills brush and number 15 i bought this
on sephora i love that it is short first
of all i find that long brushes when it
comes to winged eyeliner it just makes
it a little bit more difficult to do
because you don't have that much control
over a long brush but this the fact that
it's short it's so easy to get a sturdy
application and also this is a nice
stiff angled brush and it's very very
thin you get like a perfect sharp wing
with it I hate it when angled brushes
are too thick and fat because you can't
get that pointy wing this brush is just
perfect for that
love it for winged eyeliner now I want
to talk about this face powder because
it is so amazing I use this powder in a
recent makeup tutorial and I just been
using it all month this is from a brand
RMS beauty really great makeup line they
have a lot of like natural ingredients
and this is
they're unpowered it's called unpowered
I still love and obsess over the RCM a
no color powder this is my favorite
powder ever because it's like twelve
bucks and you get three ounces it's an
incredible deal
an incredible powder it's literally
sitting here on my vanity cuz it's the
one I use the most but I was on the
Beauty lish website one day and I saw
this powder and thought hey I like RMS
beauty I'm gonna try that and I really
really love it it makes my skin look
porcelain like it makes my skin look
like a doll so smooth and even and
perfect and the weird thing is that it
only has like one ingredient it's just
silica which I find kind of strange
because I know silica is what the Make
Up For Ever HD powder is made out of I
feel like it feels it feels very similar
like when you rub your finger in this
powder it feels extremely similar to the
Make Up For Ever HD powder but this one
feels even better it feels even more
lightweight more finely milled and more
amazing I don't know I don't explain it
I just love the way it makes my skin
look I used it today to set my entire
face I was wearing kind of like a dewy
foundation and then I packed this on my
whole face the other day I went to lunch
with my sister and all I had on was the
Tarte shaped tape concealer I had it
underneath my eyes like for my dark
circles and I also used this on like a
couple little blemishes I had on my
forehead that's the other thing about
this you can use this on your blemishes
as well because it's full coverage and
matte and amazing and it doesn't look
bad but anyway I was just wearing this
and this powder all over my face I
didn't have any foundation on at all and
my sister was like what do you have on
your skin your skin looks literally
flawless and I was like oh my god the
Tarte concealer and just like this
powder seriously check out the RMS
beauty on powder coz oh woah oh so good
okay so my next favorite I'm so excited
about I was just on Amazon one day and I
ran into the cutest freaking Z palettes
I have ever seen which is my next
favorite by the way these Z palettes
look how beautiful these Z palettes are
I have never seen them before I don't
think they're new they're probably super
old but look at this how beautiful I
could stare at that Oh
all day that is so mesmerizing these are
called the holographic Z palettes if you
are interested in them that's how they
are labeled on Amazon and I picked up a
couple of them so that I can store my
anastacio glow kits in them because I
have all of the glow kits but I don't
use all the shades and all of the glow
kits so I decided to put the ones I use
the most into Z palettes like this and I
thought it was so cool to put like
highlights in this holographic kind of Z
palette yeah I just wanted to mention
these Z palettes because I had never
seen them before and I think they're
really really really cute and I just I
love looking at them I think they're fun
so I thought hey I would tell my friends
about it so my next favorite is
something I've been using so much I
didn't think I would get so much use out
of this because I didn't really use the
original and this is the morphe en9
palette and it's just their newest blush
palette I love this palette and I didn't
really use their original blush but I
think it's called and B or something at
9b I don't know and the colors were
really pretty in that one I just didn't
really use it that much this one I don't
know if you can tell it's like really
dirty I've been using this a lot I tried
to clean it as much as I could before
this video I'm actually wearing this
palette on my face right now I have a
combination of this one and these two I
just like mix these three together and
that's the blush that's on my face right
now these are the kind of colors I love
you have like a really pretty shimmery
orange e pinky gold and then you have
all of these other warm neutral shades I
love all of the tones in this palette
and I've used all of them except these
two colors up here at the top they're
just a little bit too dark for me really
really love this palette it's so
affordable and I highly recommend it
because it's very very pigmented and for
the price you really can't beat it
colors are just so pretty especially for
summertime like this is the perfect
summer palette travel with or just to
have a lot of blushes in one so my next
favorite is kind of random in an older
favorites video I don't know how many
months back I spoke about the tangle
teezer and how much
I was loving the Tangle Teezer and I had
used it for a long time until I
discovered the freakin wet brush let me
take off some of his hair that's gross
I love the wet brush I got it on Amazon
and I always thought oh you know that
brush kind of looks weird I don't think
I would like it it honestly looks like a
standard brush you would get at CVS but
it detangles my hair even better than my
tangle teezer
which is crazy I love using the tangle
teezer when it's when my hair is wet and
I like using this one even more than the
tangle teezer especially when my hair is
wet it goes through my knots like buttah
just like I brush my hair and I don't
struggle at all if you haven't tried the
wet brush it's awesome for detangling
your hair so good and I know it's weird
at the hairbrush but I decided to show
you because I think you should own it
too because it's good okay so two more
products before in this video I have a
perfume favorite this month and I have a
little bit of a story to go along with
this perfume not a story but well anyway
this is a new perfume from Stella
McCartney and it is called pop you've
probably seen this going around social
media lately or on the Sephora website
since it's a pretty new fragrance and I
picked it up because it was a point perk
at Sephora and I thought it was the
cutest little bottle ever and even
though I had never smelled it before I
decided to use it it was like a two
hundred and fifty point perk and when I
got this in the mail and smelled it for
the first time I immediately went on the
website and picked up this rollerball
because this perfume took me back in
time instantly I have never owned this
perfume before it's brand new but this
to me
smells like Barbie's like actual Barbie
dolls and it was instantly like I
instantly knew it smelled like Barbies
it wasn't like it was on my skin and I
was like oh this smells familiar
no I put this all over my wrists and my
neck and as soon as I smelled it like
once a head settled in I was like oh my
gosh this smells like Teresa I need more
the scent makes me want to cry I know it
sounds romantic but when I smell it it
takes me back to my backyard playing on
a bunch of blankets with my Barbie beach
bungalow house with Teresa in my hand
because I was always a Teresa girl I
wasn't really
- like Barbie I liked Teresa more I
always pictured her like the cool latina
friend and I had made my mom smile this
house like mom doesn't the smelly
Barbies
smell it and she smelled it and she was
like I mean it's been a long time since
I smelled Barbies so I don't know and
then I went and I asked my friend
Melissa I was like Melissa doesn't this
smell like Barbies and she totally told
me the same thing she was like I don't
know it's been a long time then I was
like what
so maybe I'm the only one and maybe I'm
crazy because two people who I've asked
did not agree with me and those are the
only people who I've asked but it smells
like freakin Barbies and not like in a
gross plastic way and a delicious oh my
gosh
I smell like Malibu Barbie in that kind
of way but for those of you don't play
with Barbies it's a fruity scent I have
I've gone on on a Barbie rant and I
haven't even told you what it smells
like I'll put the notes here on the
screen somewhere but it's a really
pretty fresh and fruity scent and I read
a lot of reviews and a lot of people
said it didn't last on them but this
fragrance seems to last on my skin at
least I noticed it throughout the day
like I keep smelling Barbies okay so my
last favorite is the weirdest but the
coolest product ever
you guys should buy it for the
experience alone I'm serious this is the
origins warm down
warming lava scrub to detox and smooth
this stuff is wild guys wild
this is a typical body scrub but it's a
hot body scrub and never used anything
like this it says a just product amount
for your desired warming effect more
products creates more warming yes it
does
I bought this on the Sephora website
because it said I have a hair pulled up
it said it was a water activating
warming lava scrub that relaxes sore
muscles and detoxes skin post-workout
that's really why I bought this because
I wanted something to like ease my
stress after like working out and I
thought a hot scrub would be awesome
this stuff isn't warm this is hot I mean
if you use a nice amount like if you use
a little bit of product then yes it's a
nice warming sensation but if you apply
too much of this like if you squish this
out on your arm and you put a lot and
you start rubbing it in like it'll burn
you it is hot I didn't notice how hot it
was and I wanted to see like men
this possibly get so I was like putting
it on my leg and as I started to rub it
in my leg it was actually uncomfortably
hot I was pretty impressed actually
pretty impressed it's pretty good I like
this especially if you have like sore
muscles it's really nice to have like a
warming scrub it's like a really cool
relaxing experience
