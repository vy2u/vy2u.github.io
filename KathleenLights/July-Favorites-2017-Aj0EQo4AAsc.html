my July favorites these are products I
was loving in the month of July
I actually don't have that many things
to talk about today mainly because I am
pre recording this video next week is
insane for me it's probably the busiest
week I've ever had
I won't be able to film so I am pre
recording this video a week early so I
don't really have that many new products
to talk about and also I've been liking
a lot of the same things I spoke about
in my last favorites video but I still
have some good stuff to share with you
guys a lot of them are very makeup II
but it's still some stuff I want you
guys to know about so let's just jump in
okay so my first favorite is this guy I
didn't think I would be replacing my
Clarins tanning serum at all but I think
I like this one way more this is the
Akula some with tan anti-aging face
serum and this is a daily use gradual
tan treatment this is how I use it I
just take some of my moisturizer at
nighttime put it on the back of my hand
and just squeeze one drop of this into
my moisturizer mix it all up and apply
it to my skin and then the next day when
I wake up my face is a bit more tan and
then it matches the rest of my body it's
not going to make you extremely tan
unless you add like two to five drops be
very cautious with this for me one drop
is all I need I feel like it gives you a
nice even look it doesn't get patched on
me or does it look spotty like it
doesn't look weird I really really like
it and I use this about every three days
I find that the tan on my face lasts
about three days and I haven't been
using self-tanner or anything it's just
the summer time and I've been out in the
Sun a lot in my mom's pool and trust me
I use a lot of SPF I'm actually going to
be sharing with you my favorite SPF
products this month but I'm always
wearing SPF in the Sun always reapplying
the problem with me is that I always
wear a hat while in the Sun so even
though I'm applying SPF 50 a lot I
always like to wear a hat just so that
the Sun can stay on my face and it
doesn't hit my face at all so find that
the rest of my body does get a bit tan
but my face doesn't so that's where this
guy comes in and I love this okay so
this is not a new product by any means
but I have been using it so much for
like the past two weeks this is the wet
and wild
Megha cushion contour I love this so
much I pretty sure I spoke about this in
a favorites video once when it first
came out it's one of those cushion
products where it has a little spongy
thing right here but it's a cream
bronzer and it is so good I love the
undertone in this it is a bit warm but
it's not orange II it looks so nice in
the summer and I love how this is so
easy to blend and it never looks muddy
some cream contours they look patchy
they separate or it'll pick up your
foundation underneath and just it won't
look good but this one always looks good
and I don't know I've just been using it
a lot again recently in my opinion this
is the best liquid or cream contour at
the drugstore hands down it is so good
I don't know why I stopped using it for
a while there but I love it this is a
mache cafe la cafe cafe au lait I don't
know but I hope that means that they're
going to come out with different colors
because I think this is the only one
they have so far but I will meet alright
so basically I completely stopped using
toner in my skincare routine it had been
like a year and a half where I really
wasn't using toner there but I
discovered this and I have fallen in
love with this but I don't even use this
at night I only use this in the morning
I know a lot of people swear by toners
for me it's a step that you either like
or you don't I feel like it's really
important to some people but not so much
for others for me I've never really
cared about it but this is the southern
Park Beauty water and I use this in the
morning when I wake up right before I
sit down to get ready for the day I like
to put my makeup on or get ready to film
a video I use this I just get oh I ran
out I was gonna grab a cotton round but
I ran out I have to go to Walgreens
but I'll get a little cotton around for
a few drops onto the cotton round and
just massage this on my entire face and
I feel like it just like tones and
cleans my skin it doesn't strip the skin
and it feels really refreshing and it
gets like extra dirt off your face and
when I look at the cotton around even
though my face is clean I'll still see a
little bit of like residue from the day
before I've only used about this much so
I need to use it a bit more but I've
been using this all month and I really
like it
okay I am so impressed with the NYX epic
ink liner in waterproof I have mine in
the shade black I'm not exactly sure if
they have more shades but this is such a
great eyeliner the eyeliner I'm wearing
right now I'm I did like simple little
wings and it is so black and it lasts
all
day on the eyes the only thing I don't
love about this is that it's not as mess
as it is black but it's not it's not
shiny or anything I mean you can see
it's not like very shiny but I have
other eyeliners that are a bit more
matte I look past that because I think
the formula is so good ever since I did
that waterproof makeup video can't stop
using this I even wore this to a pool
party the other day and my eyeliner just
stayed all day it was awesome I even got
a media hooked on this she wore to the
same pool party too and she was all
about it I think it's a great liquid
liner at the drugstore especially if you
are looking for a waterproof one and by
the way I also wanted to mention the
necklace I'm wearing I'm not sure if you
can see it really well but it's the most
beautiful dainty little necklace and
it's of a little lightning bolt and I'm
obsessed with it my sister actually
created her own brand it's her own
jewelry line it's called Co you can
follow her page on Instagram ICO
underscore by e let I'll have it like
here on the screen
it's xio but it's pronounced co and she
has the cutest little pieces I love her
necklaces she's been doing this for a
while she used to have like a boutique
back in the day that sold jewelry but
now she has Co and I'm so proud of her
and I'm so happy for her I love the
jewelry I mean my sister I have very
similar taste when it comes to jewelry
like everything she loves I tend to look
so she thought of this cute little
lightning bolt idea to represent the
life squad that's kind of like what we
call our close friends and family refer
to them as the like squad but also what
I call my subscribers as well I kind of
refer to them as like the like squad on
my own secretly so she came out with
these cute little Lightning necklaces
and I love them this would be perfectly
paired with like a cute little choker to
have been layered I don't know I love it
I love little dainty pieces like there
but yeah definitely check out my
sister's Instagram if you can it would
mean a lot to me
and these little lightning bolts are
totes available if you want to be part
of the light squad we should be matching
matching I just wanted to mention Co
because I have a wearing Co non stuff
okay so I want to talk about some SPS
products I can't get enough of this one
I use on my face and this one I use on
my body this is the it cosmetics
anti-aging Armour super smart skin
perfecting beauty fluid SPF 50 and it's
a physical sunscreen I
this I've been using this every single
time I get in the pool you have to shake
this really well before you apply it to
your skin because if not it will have
like kind of like a greasy consistency
but once you shake it up it is amazing
I've used this so much it looks like
crap I have to clean it before I start
on this video because it was kind of
like a tinted explosion here but it
comes out with this like skin tint so it
doesn't really leave your skin with this
weird ghost white cast when you rub it
in because some of Fae sunscreens will
do that this was scented it doesn't have
any coverage or anything like that but
it blends right into the skin without
feeling greasy it's MSPs when you put it
on your face you feel like you can't
really touch your face because it's all
like greasy feeling you don't get that
with this I love it and I just reapply
it every two hours it really works for
me it doesn't break me out and make me
sensitive usually physical sunscreens
are a little bit better for my sensitive
skin I just prefer them over chemical
sunscreens they're both alright but I
just prefer a physical sunscreen and
this one is a really really good one but
this guy I love this so much this is the
super group sunscreen mousse
this is SPF 50 as well and this is so
easy to apply it literally is a move for
me shine your light it's a free is a
mousse you just rub it right into the
skin and boom you're protected by the
Sun I love it and the best part is that
it just sinks right into the skin like
it's got like it's just like it's gone
doesn't feel right are tending to it so
anything it doesn't feel greasy it's not
oily it's not thick it has the perfect
consistency and I feel like it really
does stay on the skin it says its water
resistant for up to 80 minutes and I
believe that and it's just so easy to
apply and just so fun it's a mousse I
love it I got this little guy at Sephora
but I definitely want to go and pick up
the bigger version because honestly this
is like the only SPF I want to use on my
body for the rest of the summer so the
rest my life I love it okay and then I
have another SPS product but this is a
lip balm and for me it's more kind of
like a lip sync this is a very bombing
it's not super hydrating but this is the
Pacifica Sun and lip care SPF 30 mineral
color lip balm I have mine in the shade
nude and this is also water resistant
for up to 80 minutes I saw that SPF lip
balms were like a big gimmick it was
pointless it was soup
but oh my gosh a couple weeks ago I was
at my mom's house and the Sun was so
intense but I mean I had SPF on I didn't
really think anything about it I didn't
burn or anything but my lips mine is
roasting they were super cracked they
had a bunch of lines in them days I mean
you could just tell that they were
burned by the Sun which was so strange
because I didn't feel that happening
throughout the day and then I just
stumbled upon this guy at Target and I
thought you know what I'm going to give
this a go and I have been wearing this
every time I get into a pool now and I
find that it works this is not super
hydrating you're extremely moisturizing
but it gives you enough and it's very
comfortable
I like this color because it's a very
natural color and it doesn't show up too
much like it's not very pigmented you
can see it right there it's like a very
light wash of color like a barely-there
nudey pink but yet you can still see it
it's like the perfect amount of
pigmentation to wear if you're not
wearing any makeup
it's sheer enough to where it looks okay
but if you are wearing makeup in the
floor and the Sun it has enough color to
where it looks like you're wearing a lip
product does it make any sense I love
the pigmentation and I love that has SPF
30 I love everything about this and for
me lip SPF are no longer a gimmick and I
highly recommend this one they have
other colors that I definitely want to
check them out and this also smells good
I can't smell it right now because I'm
stuffy but this also smokes okay so I
have fallen in love with a bronzer I
never thought I would like this is the
Guerlain terracotta Sun tonic oh my gosh
this is waterproof I could have used
this in my water for video I have no
idea this is waterproof this is the
waterproof and long-lasting bronzer in
the shade zero three natural first of
all the packaging is so pretty I want a
nail polish like this like I want to
create one it has a beautiful orange
color but when you turn it it has a
really pretty golden dual chrome and I
really like this packaging but besides
that I really really like this bronzer
especially in the summer time when I am
my fairest or like when I'm my natural
skin color I think this might be a
little bit too warm and now with my tan
tan I find it to be so pretty it's a
bronzer I'm wearing on my skin right now
and I feel like it just gives your skin
the most beautiful Sun Tan JLo esque
vibe it's so pretty it has a very slight
sheen to it almost like little tiny
golden glitter but it doesn't really
show up that much on the
skin if anything it just shows up as
like a soft Sheen it just makes your
skin look glowy and beautiful and not
like glittery in any way I love this
freaking color and I heard so many
people talk about these drill arm
bronzers oh they're the best and the
best of the best and I never thought
they were worth investing in but I saw
this one and the packaging drew me in
and I just wanted to give it a shot and
I'm so glad I did because even though it
is pricey I do think it's worth the
money because it does last a long time
on my skin it's not a bronzer I have to
reapply I stay looking golden and glowy
like for the entire day so I really
really love it if but I see buddy's boo
this foundation I'm cheating I'm so
cheating I haven't been wearing this
that long it hasn't been the entire
month but this is the number seven state
perfect foundation it's awesome it says
it's for all skin types has medium
coverage
non-stop complexion perfection and it
has all day wear it also has SPF 15 I do
notice it has a bit of a flashback to it
which is probably the SPMS but it's
nothing that's too crazy and for the
most part I've been wearing this during
the day or and I'm not really taking
like flash photography I love how this
makes my skin look I'm wearing this
foundation right now although I haven't
mixed in with something else but I like
how natural this looks in a very
flawless way like the list in luminate
foundation from number seven is a huge
favorite of mine this stuff is so dewy
and so beautiful but sometimes it can
get a little bit too dewy like this
combination right here is a match made
in heaven but this is such a pretty
satin finish and it just looks flawless
for the entire day it doesn't get crusty
around my nose or in between my brows it
just stays looking pretty for the entire
day I wish they would take out the SPS
but I love the formula so much I just
look past that I love that it comes with
a pump I just I really been impressed
with number seven foundations it makes
me want to go out and purchase a bunch
of things from this brand because I've
been pretty impressed and I definitely
see how a lot of different skin types
would really like it because it's not
duly it's not matte it's like the
perfect in-between and has medium
coverage you know it's not too sheer
it's not too much it's like an
all-around good foundation like if this
foundation was in a yearbooks he would
win best all-around you know I mean yeah
by the way I have
this mixed in with the foundation today
this is the Tarte rainforest of the sea
radiance drops I know a lot of people
hate this but I really like this I don't
know this is limited edition or not but
I have been dropping one tiny tiny
little drop into my more matte or more
sentient foundations to make them do
here and Wow it is beautiful
I don't know I think people are getting
the impression that this is like a
liquid highlight to tap on the skin but
I don't think so it's pretty much just
like shimmery oil but it gives a
beautiful dewy look to the skin and this
will come right here I really like it
okay guys and then my last favorite is
this guy I have gotten so many questions
about this ever since you guys have seen
me uses and like tutorials and stuff
this is these a wave a 100 brush and it
is my new favorite bronzer brush I feel
like every month I discover a new
favorite bronzer brush but I think this
one beats them all I think this one is
at the top at the very top of the
pyramid it has this perfect angle to it
to where you could just bronze the skin
so perfectly and so easily like you grab
your little bronzer you dip it in it
just fits right here in the hollows
right here perfectly so you get a nice
diffused application it's big enough to
where it's not too harsh but it has the
perfect shape to wear it like literally
fits perfectly in the hollows of the
cheek bones so you contour at the same
time it like does everything and bronzes
and contours it's amazing and it's the
perfect density to where you're not
applying too much products you don't get
a harsh application I just I love it
it's so fluffy so soft and it's the
perfect bronzer brush and so if you guys
so that completes this video these were
products I was really loving in the
month of July leave me a comment down
below letting know what your favorite
product was this month and maybe I'll
check it out if I have not so yeah guys
