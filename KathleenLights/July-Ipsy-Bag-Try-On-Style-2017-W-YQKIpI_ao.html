mine it's bags and bagging which is why
I don't have eyebrows on I feel so weird
what you have myself in the viewfinder
without eyebrows ah let's get started on
this video oh I almost love Mike so this
is what the package looks like this
month it's really cute with my first saw
I thought it was a hamster like laying
down a little white rug so now I think
it's an egg and the back part has a butt
which is that was pretty funny so let's
open this guy up here is the card you
get it says hey there sleepyhead
oh yes okay this is a cartoon egg
gudetama I'm probably pronouncing that
completely wrong he's supposed to be a
sleepy super chill cartoon egg so first
in the bag is moose this is the cella
tantalizing taupe eyebrow cream I have
used chela in the past before and I
actually really do like this bad like
the things that I've tried I really like
the fact that I saw the eyebrow cream is
kind of wigging me out I don't know what
to expect okay so I don't know if this
is like there's dog hair if this is like
it it's like a little brush okay okay so
this right has an angled brush I don't
know what would be on this
okay wave it this cap just came oh wait
a minute wait a minute Perris like brow
product at the bottom of this so I'm
assuming you take this off take this
part off and then dip it into this
product and apply it to your brow so
it's kind of like a pomade I'm assuming
I'm a little rivers but let's try it out
okay so I'm just going to run the brush
through my hair and really quick and
let's see
okay so I don't I don't like this
product if I'm going to be completely
honest with you I think it did a good
job I think my eyebrows look alright but
I did find this a little bit hard to
work with I struggle especially on my
tails here I'm not someone who really
uses cream products on the eyebrows so
maybe if you do you won't struggle with
this but I found it to be a little bit
hard to work with because of how its set
up so you have this angled brush right
when you try to dip this brush into this
little tube you're only putting products
at the very tip of the angle the brush
because it is what hits the bottom first
because at an angle but because the
cylinder is so tight like so thin you
can't really bend and you can't really
get product on the entire angled brush
does that make any sense to anybody I
hope I'm making sense so I found that I
was only able to really get product at
the very tip of the brush and whenever I
would try to just like push down harder
to get it on everything
it would just gunk up and apply way too
much product like it would pick up way
too much product so I don't like the
application process the formula seems
nice but because I struggle with the
application process I just don't see
myself using this I have so many eyebrow
products that I truly love and our holy
grail for me that I'm just going to pass
this on to a friend all right so the
next thing in the bag is this eyeliner
this is the CIPA wonder wand gel kohl
eyeliner and that's pretty much it
nothing special nothing not special I
hate these little plastic things so okay
I have a little brush on one end and
then I have good eyeliner on the other
so I guess there is something special
I'm just going to apply some others to
my tight lines
okay so that's very black and it went
really smooth even though it is a wooden
eyeliner some of these are kind of
stabby this one is a very savvy which is
good
this one is making my eyes so watery go
holy crap
I think wooden eyeliners make my eyes
cry more than like retractable eyeliners
I don't know if that's just me leave me
a comment down below that haven't see
YouTube I'm just going to go ahead and
pull out the other thing that's in the
bag and we should try it on the spot
because it's a mascara so we might as
well this is a little too looks sample
of the Too Faced better than sex mascara
I actually really do love this mascara I
think it's really great I love getting
little travel mascaras I looked
so I absolutely love this mascara I
already know I love it
I'm so glad we got it in the FC bag
because I didn't have a little trouble
one I really really like this mascara I
know a lot of people don't like it but I
think it gives some drama to the lashes
and it makes them look really pretty and
wispy like feathery alright and the next
thing in the bag is this guy this is the
event mattifying toner for oily blemish
prone skin so I'm not even going to try
this this is a mattifying toner and I
have extremely dry skin I'm kind of
afraid this is going to dry out my skin
but I have used event in the past like
this brand and I really really like
their products so I'm sure those of you
with oily skin might really like this
but I cannot give you my opinion on it
because I normally do this and then last
but certainly not least is this guy
right here this is the ginger and gold
peach and gold frosting blush it's from
the brand Sarafine botanical I don't
think I've ever heard of this brand and
it has ginger lychee mangosteen and
chamomile extracts um that sounds
amazing a multi-dimensional versatile
blush with micro gold frosting to create
a subtle shimmering flush alright this
is what it looks like oh I really like
this color I haven't looked inside the
box yet whoo this feels anybody creamy
oh my gosh not sure if you can see it
but it's such a pretty natural pinky
gold okay I'm going to take my Linda
Hallberg 310 brush I have a feeling it's
going to be very so so I'm really gonna
just let you dig myself and it kind of
created do you see that invention of
where i swatched it there the depths
creating a film and not letting me pick
up as much product as I want it to okay
yes I can see it yes definitely you have
to apply a little bit more than you
think you need it's a very very subtle
illuminating blush this one isn't chunky
it doesn't have like thick glitter it's
a very natural Sheen oh I think I like
dip it up
I really like that definitely my
favorite thing in the box
I'm just really confused and worried
about that like what - like scrape that
off okay guys so that completes this
video these were all the products now
we're in my Ipsy bag this month I really
like the blush I love the mascara but
we'll leave the full-size prices down
below all that good stuff like I usually
do but let me know what you got in your
is to bag this month did you hate it did

comments below but yes I complete to say
