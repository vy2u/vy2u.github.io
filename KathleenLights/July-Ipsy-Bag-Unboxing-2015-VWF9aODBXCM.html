my Ipsy bag you know I always say
unboxing and it's not a box but yet
every video I say unboxing I have
entitled it unboxing but it's a bag but
doesn't unbagging sound weird I didn't
have an Ipsy bag video up last month a
lot of you guys thought I canceled my
Ipsy bag but I didn't it's just last
month when I got it in the mail I was in
bed like two days after my wisdom teeth
surgery so obviously I wasn't gonna film
so I just opened it in bed with my face
this big and I just didn't film it but I
did not cancel it I know a lot of you
guys really like my Ipsy bag videos a
lot some people really hate them but it
gets requested so much so I will
continue to do them so let's get in it
now I get excited I used to if you've
been watching my channel for a really
long time I used to like throw the card
because I used to hate these cards but
now I like getting them because my
friends are on them like it does busy
and there's a lesser loves where boobs
in the air and then of course crispy and
Kristin also look really pretty in this
I love these and then desi in the back
so now I like to see these cars cuz I'm
like I wonder how cute they look on this
month's card smell like the Ipsy girls
are on their cards which i think is
really cute i love krispies bun
it's like poppin mottely not like mine
mine is like look at this loop i'm not
cute okay on to the actual bag so this
what the bag looks like this month this
month the bag is really cute i like it i
like it it's very like summery i like it
i like it okay so let's just grab first
thing in the bag this month is this t's
cosmetics the only thing I don't like
about FC is that it doesn't have a card
like foxy charm has a list of products
in the back with the prices of
everything and then it kind of gives you
a description of the product I hate that
it's just like a guessing game
wipsy like you don't have a card that
tells you if they would just add little
things to the card it'd be great
this is 80's cosmetics read my lips
lipstick it says moisturizing on it
eight-hour long-lasting unique satin
matte finish highly pigmented coverage
this is in the shade killing me softly
oh my god it looks like a Disney pen
do you guys know like the ones that they
sell I'm so random never mind but it
looks like a pen that they sell it a
gift shop okay oh well these look really
similar to like the color pop packaging
this color is really pretty too it's a
nice peach oh it is matte it's like a
nice peachy coral a matte lipstick I
really like this packaging that's
killing me softly my next product is in
this little bag and it is the Vasanti
Asante we had a we had this brand in
boxycharm this month Vasanti brighten up
exfoliating cleanser and rich with
papaya microcrystals
and aloe dramatically improve your
skin's texture to reveal softer brighter
and younger looking skin paraben free
sulfate free 99% natural not a hundred
percent 99 percent I just want to like
smell this for some reason
so yeah it's just an exfoliator and it
doesn't really smell like anything which
is good doesn't smell bad that's always
a good thing then we have this guy right
here by the way I'm pretty sure this is
full-size um this looks like a sample
this looks full-sized though this is the
Octavio la playa sea salt spray infused
with algae extract blah blah that's
Spanish - infused with algae extract
this sea salt spray uses rich richness
of the sea to create texture and volume
I'm not super super super into sea salt
sprays because I have dry hair from the
bleach in my hair and sea salt spray is
really just dry out my hair why am i
spraying it it's a sea salt spray so I'm
probably gonna pass this one along but a
lot of people love sea salt spray sprays
so that's that's good
that's a good product to have in the
book in the back not the bots the back
ok two more things uh this is a jelly
pong pong jelly pong pong that's a funny
name two in one eyeliner and shadow oh
this is gonna be a business to open so
that this is just like a cream eyeshadow
like one of those eyeshadow sticks it is
a really pretty color I probably use
this more as an eyeliner than an
eyeshadow because it is a little bit
drying for an eyeshadow base or an
all-over lid color but it is this would
be a nice eyeliner like for the
waterline by the way I will have prices
of everything in the description box
like I always do for my Ipsy videos
because I don't have an actual card that
tells me the price and stuff and then
the last thing are a pair of tweezers
isn't that so random okay these are
tweezers from the brown crown brush
crown brush actually it says this could
be a really good thing my favorite
tweezers are from Revlon but yeah I mean
we could apply your lashes with it you
could block your unibrow I mean the
possibilities are endless so that was
everything that was in my bag this month
actually really like the bag it's not a
bad bag at all I have to try things out
first cuz you know you never know this
may be like a moisturizing sea salt
spray who knows this could be the
world's greatest exfoliator I don't know
yet I know that everybody gets different
things in if see bags so leave me

MZ bag did you like it what was your
favorite product like what did you think
about it thank you guys so much watching
