is it is early it was sleepy and yet I
still have a full base eye makeup on
yeah that's true um and I don't know
what's happening with my hair I was
channeling my inner Olsen twin my
American national hair like how they
used to wear their hair like up here
when they were like 5 I'm 22 I shouldn't
be doing my hair like this but whatever
today's video is my olya unboxing and I
got this like a couple weeks ago but I
had sat it down on my table and I was
going to film it but then I had to film
a bunch of other videos and then I
completely forgot that this was sitting
there until yesterday I was like oh my
God my alia Bhatt because I haven't
opened it so there's the video I'm doing
today I know I've gotten a couple of
comments saying all I do is unboxing
videos now and honestly that's not true
I put up three videos a week and so I
put up twelve videos a month more or
less and I only do three unboxings a
month on my channel I do two beauty
boxes and a jewelry box that's my phone
so out of the 12 videos I post a month
only three of them are unboxing videos
so I just wanted to quickly address that
because some people really really like
my unboxing videos some don't but you
can't place the world I'll try but it
doesn't work so anyway let's get into
the Barmes now maybe you guys have seen
my only unboxing videos before it is a
jewelry monthly subscription service
where it's either $25 a month or $35 a
month me $25 a month box gives you 2 to
3 jewelry pieces and me $35 ones gives
you 3 to 4 oh this is what the box looks
like inside this month it comes in these
amazing reusable bags this came in handy
when I was moving up here because I
store all my jewelry in these bags these
are reusable they're eco-friendly I like
these Reds a lot and then it comes with
the cards that you know teaches you how
to preserve your jewelry life and all
that stuff so this month I have the $35
back to share with you guys
and I'm just gonna help write it I just
realized I look like ariana grande with
this here even though it's it's a
ponytail but I feel like maybe like so
the first thing in the bag is this
really pretty you can barely see it it's
so like simple it's this really pretty
thin gold chain with a tiny little like
rhinestone like little diamond at the
bottom it is really really pretty and
dainty what I really love about olio box
is that they give you like either like
giant beautiful statement pieces or they
give you really dainty pretty pieces so
this one is really really gorgeous this
would look so pretty
which is like a simple little top this
could be really elegant too I think it's
so pretty so that's the first piece the
next thing in the bag wow this is so
pretty the next thing in the bag is this
really really gorgeous like statement
necklace it is like this beautiful
turquoise greenish minty ish color
mm-hmm great description pathway a great
description but it is so pretty
especially for the summertime I'm just
obsessed with this like immediately I
know I love this necklace this looks so
pretty with like a little tank top or
something I don't know I really really
love this I think this would look so
great with like ripped jeans tank top I
know I love bold necklaces like this and
love's statement necklaces they're so so
great in style very in style and amazing
for the summer time another thing you
have to keep in mind is that olia box
will never send you something that like
people wore like in 2003 you know what I
mean like it's always on trend
everything that olya sends you are on
trend jewelry pieces but that's always a
really good thing to keep in mind okay
so there's two more things in the back
and they are both earrings there this
one is like tiny little diamond earrings
I'm guessing is what you would use to
pair off with this which is actually a
really pretty
these are the kinds of earrings that I
love wearing I wear these type of
earrings like every day these these
earrings I never take them off so I
really love simple small little studs
and these are extra pretty because they
do have that little diamonds in it
so it looks really really elegant on the
ears I see myself using this a lot and
then the last thing in the bag are these
earrings and these are the earrings that
pair with did necklace the statement
necklace and personally I don't like to
pair like statement necklaces with
matching earrings like this I think that
it is just a way to imagine matching for
me but I definitely see myself wearing
these by itself like as just big
earrings with no necklace I think it's
really pretty I love the color like I
love this turquoise color this will look
really really pretty in the summertime
too would like your hair down a nice and
flowy but yeah that is everything I got
in my olio box this month I really
really liked it I love how they give you
a bold necklace and like a simple little
necklace as well it's not just necklaces
and earrings by the way they do include
bracelets all the time as well so if
you're a bracelet girl you know they do
include those as well oh yeah it has
everything I have to say I know these
olio videos are really really short
because I just show you the jewelry and
then that's pretty much all I couldn't
do but I know that some people really
really love jewelry subscriptions that's
why I continue to do this on my channel
I hope you guys understand I know that I
cook I know it's not for everybody but
you know so if you are interested in the
olia box I will link the website down
below and then you can check it out and
decide for yourself what you want to do
if you are more on a budget definitely
go for the $25 one because you get great
pieces in that but and that bag too so
don't you worry girl you guys so much
for watching please subscribe if you
haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
I feel so weird today I'm like
caffeine I'm on a lot no they do include
those as well
that was not ladylike have you guys seen
the Aristocats
Tommy solo saw me don't tell me so dad
and every time I burp I think of cuz I'm
a lady that's why you're not a lady
you're nothing but a sister if you guys
have never seen that movie I just looked
like an idiot these type of earrings are
the type of ears um yeah what these
kinds of earrings are the type of
earring these kinds of earrings what am

problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
