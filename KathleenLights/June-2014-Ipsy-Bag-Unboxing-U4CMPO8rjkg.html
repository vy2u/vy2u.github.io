judge my bun even though it looks like
the poop emoji don't judge me
today has been a very stressful day I
was not planning on filming today I have
so many things I have to do then all of
a sudden I heard a mysterious knock on
the door and when I went to go open it
was the Ipsy Man and biopsy man I mean
mailman so that means my Ipsy bag got
here today and I had to sit down and
film this video I had to because I have
to get this video up for you guys cuz I
know you guys love the Ipsy bag
unboxings so I literally sit on like
five second make up like super super
quick and I probably put too much blush
on I don't know I threw my hair up in a
bun like the worst one in the history of
the world and I sat down here and I'm
filming this now so let's get on with it
so actually the first thing I see in the
bag isn't in the actual Ipsy bag it was
in this bag and it is a BB cushion this
is what this is what it looks like it
says introducing the world's first
fastest fashion-forward BB cushion I
don't know what this is this oh okay
okay so this is like a BB cream in a
cushion it is available in three
different shades light medium and dark
and they give you the three shades light
medium and dark so it just says apply 15
minutes before sun exposure reapply at
least every two hours use a water
resistant sunscreen and swimming or
sweating so this is something that you
have to like reapply over two hours this
isn't going to be like a BB cream where
you could put it on and wear it
throughout the day so yeah I will be
trying this out at the end of the video
anyway I don't know if I mentioned this
is by the brand called lenay I hope I'm
saying that right
Lynnae and I've heard really good things
about their skincare line so this
actually could be a pretty cool thing
and the full-size of this like one of
these things retails for $34 so for like
a BB cream type of thing Desa spit so
moving on to the actual bag this is what
it looks like
oh it says Rebecca Minkoff right here in
the corner so I guess I don't know it
yeah I guess if she partnered up with a
Rebecca Minkoff to create this bag and
let me tell you I like the bag it's
really pretty I like it so let's open
okay so the theme this month is pretty
and paradise you already know so the
first thing I see in the bag is a NYX
butter gloss and I'm pretty sure
everybody got a NYX butter gloss and I
got mine and apple strudel which I'm
excited about because I don't have this
one I was kind of like oh my god I hope
I don't get a color I already have which
is good because I don't have apple
strudel I'm obsessed with NYX butter
glosses you cannot go wrong with these
these are amazing they're my favorite
glasses in the entire world so um yes
Thank You Ipsy I love this and these
retail for five dollars next thing in my
bag is this shimmer eyeliner by
a brand called Nick Nick Huck New York
wait a minute I think we got a nail
polish by this brand one month
I think they've added this brand in our
FC bags before so yeah this is just a
blue eyeliner let me do a little swatch
a swatch okay so it's a very blue
shimmery eyeliner like a liquid liner
this is the color right there it's very
very intense it's like poolside blue
like a like a pool that's what I think
of like BAM in your face so this could
be fun these retail for $4.99 so they
are affordable and by the way guys this
won't come off my hand I have been
trying to take this off for like 20
minutes does not come off so the next
thing in the bag is this little pure
care dry oil for hair nourishing hair
treatment with African macadamia oil I
love hair oils like that is my favorite
thing in the world oh my god this smells
really really amazing this smells like a
yummy vanilla macadamia scent I really
really like this and this obviously
isn't a full-size the full-size is 498
so it is a very very affordable thing
and it feels really nice and yeah and
then the last thing the bag is also like
a little sample thingy and it is the
mdsolarsciences
mineral tinted cream broad spectrum SPF
30 so I guess it's like a tinted
sunscreen so you could put on your face
let me blend this in
on hand to see the full size of this
retails for $30 so it's not cheap it's
not cheap so yeah it feels really nice
it doesn't have like a really nasty
scent and yeah that is this I'm excited
to try this because it is summertime and
it's SPF 30 so like this so yeah that is
everything I got in my Ipsy bag of this
month and I'm not gonna lie it is not my
favorite month usually they don't send
like products this tiny I don't know am
I being too hard on it this month let me
know it was good I do think everything I
got was good I'm definitely gonna use
the oil I'm gonna use this
I love the NYX butter gloss phase I'm
gonna try out the BB cushion so I mean I
got good things but I don't know I feel
I feel weird about this month I don't
know if I like it I don't know if I'm
like I don't know let me know what you
got here eps bag down below and if you
liked this month if you agree with me
let me know if you feel what I'm feeling
over I still think if C is a great
monthly subscription service you only
pay $10 a month and you get introduced
to really cool stuff if you want to see
a couple of these things in action just
stay tuned okay so I had to take off my
face makeup in order to try out some of
the stuff please ignore the planet that
has made my face its home stress pimple
I'm going to try out this tinted ascots
gun screen I'm gonna try the tinted
sunscreen they attempted sunscreen
I'm not myself today guys
I'm using my abuse my viewfinder is my
mirror today
so yeah what do you guys think
I think honestly it's just a brown
sunscreen okay so I'm going to try out
the Lynnae Rene we'll call it one a baby
Christian SPF 50 right here has the puff
so you like oh okay so I'm going to go
ahead and use the medium shade because I
have like self-tanner on as you can see
you can't see cuz there's a shadow but
it faces like lighter than my body so
I'm going to go ahead and try the medium
shade oh this looks dark I'm just
slowing it so I'm just gonna press it in
okay precedent
this smells good
smells like a really luxurious face
cream so it feels really really
hydrating as you can see like it is dewy
you probably will not like this if you
have oily skin oh so it did a decent job
of covering Frankenstein okay so I
really really like this product it has
pretty good coverage for being a beauty
cream and it has will be because and it
has SPF 50 which is always great
especially in the summertime it is $30
so I don't know if I would run out and
purchase this but um I like it I think
it's nice it is a little bit even to
doing for me I don't know I might have
put too much product on my face I think
that's what it was maybe I put too much
so it is a little bit too dewy so I
would definitely set this with a powder
especially if you have oily skin which
by the way I'm going to go ahead and set
now because it's one a little scary it's
a little too dewy it does say that you
have to reapply every two hours but I'm
sure if you said it you might not have
to reapply every two hours because that
just seems pretty excessive but overall
even now setting it with a powder
I do like this product I actually really
really like this product especially for
me because you guys know I have really
really dry skin I'm dating this not a
thing I will say is I don't exactly know
how sanitary this is um like the sample
we get in the Ipsy bag because it's just
like being exposed to air and stuff so I
don't exactly know how many uses you can
get out of this it feels like it has a
lot more product in there but mmm I
don't know about that situation but I'm
looking at my skin right now and I like
it it's dewy it's nice I really really
like it but it does feel like they're
still it doesn't feel like there's
something on my face but when I touch it
I kind of feel it even after I said it
okay so I'm going to try out the shimmer
eyeliner in blue and to be honest I'm a
little afraid to do so because this
won't come off my arm it won't
I even took a makeup remover wipe to it
fine right now and it won't come off so
wait let me see if I makeup remover
takes it off because ever dozen guys I'm
not putting this on that
hmm
okay I makeup remover will not remove
this I don't think I'm gonna put this on
my eyes what is in this thing I really
want to take one for the team and try it
on for you guys that I think I can I'm
afraid this is the NYX butter gloss and
apples true I'm sure you guys have seen
this millions of times but the sake of
this video I've actually never tried
this one on I like of course because all
these are amazing these things smell so
good I really recommend the NYX butter
glosses if you haven't tried them yet
they're great so yeah I'm sorry I'm not
going to try on the blue eyeliner it's a
little scary so I'm probably not going
to wear that probably might toss it I'm
not exactly sure it's like made out of
some crazy like madness I don't know
what that is but that concludes this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
