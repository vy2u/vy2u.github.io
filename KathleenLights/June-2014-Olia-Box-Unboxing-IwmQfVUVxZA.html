almost forgot the month my June only a
box to share with you guys and I have
done all the unboxings a few times on my
channel but if you don't know what it is
it is a jewelry monthly subscription
service so like if C is makeup and
skincare not stuff this is strictly
jewelry so that's always nice this month
I have the $35 bag and the $25 bag to
share with you guys I'm gonna start off
with the $25 bag so it comes in these
eco-friendly little bags that you guys
know I love I always talk about how cute
they are and how I use them all the time
so let's get right in it
so the first thing I grab out are these
really beautiful earrings I love dangly
earrings and they're so pretty I think
they would look beautiful in the summer
and in the springtime it has like teal
and baby blue and like a nice light
coral pink color and they are really
really pretty and they feel really nice
too this would look really beautiful
with like a maxi dress and like your
hair just flowing in the wind and these
earrings just dangling all around I
don't know I like it next thing in the
bag is this necklace it has like two
chains connected and then it has a bar
going across and then a bar just coming
straight down this is so gorgeous I love
dainty jewelry and that's what I really
really like about olia they give you
like really trendy simple pieces that
you can wear with pretty much anything
and they'll dress up your look this is
like beyond gorgeous
I really really love this and I wear
gold all the time so I'm excited about
this and the last thing in the bag are
these really pretty earrings these are
just tiny little studs they're little
squares and yeah I wear the same like
little gold earrings every single day I
love earrings like this because you
could pair them up with absolutely
anything with like a chunky necklace a
really long simple necklace these kind
of earrings you can wear literally every
single day and they go with pretty much
everything so I'm really excited that I
got the
earrings are so pretty they're like tiny
little squares I really really like them
a lot
okay guys so that was everything in my
$25 bag I absolutely loved every single
thing so now I'm just gonna go ahead and
move on to the $35 bag this feels really
heavy so the first thing I see is this
enormous oh no this is gorgeous this I
just pulled out this necklace this is
like a really this is so beautiful it's
like a really big thick chunky necklace
and it is really really heavy it feels
like feels like high class I really like
this this is so gorgeous I really like
this because it is something that would
look good with so many different things
because of the neutral colors it's not
like pink or blue that you could only
wear with certain things you could wear
this with a lot of different things this
is so beautiful I love this it feels
really really heavy really really nice
and I love like chunky necklaces like
this especially I'm a summer because you
could just wear a simple top out of this
and you'll look nice and dressed up I
really really like this the next thing
in the bag are these really pretty hoops
they have like little tiny ruffnut rocks
the little studs that go around the
whole hoop so they look so pretty these
are very boho to me like you could wear
this with your hair down with those
beachy curls and then put this in and
you look like you're a nice bohemian
goddess so yeah they're very simple but
they're like elegant and I don't know
gypsy ish to me I really like that I
love anything that's like gypsy type so
I see myself wearing these a lot and
then the last thing in the bag is this
really beautiful necklace this is
probably my favorite thing out of
everything it is this simple tiny little
chain that has a nice cute square stud
at the end and I love it because it's so
dainty and elegant so simple I love the
elegance in this necklace it's so pretty
and the chain is so thin and so dainty I
know I've said dainty like 17 times in
this video but I love jewelry like this
this is the perfect necklace to just
slap on every single day you know it's
like a day to day necklace I really
really loved it
it's beautiful before I think that this
month had the most impressive bags like
the $25 bag was beautiful all the months
that I received it I thought it was a
really good $25 bag and I'm usually very
skeptical about the $35 bag I always say
that the $25 bag is just as good which
it is but this one the $35 bag was
really really good
this necklace just feels so excuse the
worms this necklace just feels so so
elegant and beautiful I'm very very
impressed like I said if you're really
into jewelry and you don't mind spending
twenty-five to thirty-five dollars a
month and go ahead and check out the
olia website it's a really nice monthly
subscription service and you get trendy
pieces delivered to your door every
single month so you'll always be on
trend so yeah that is the end of this
video thank you guys so much for
watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
have almost didn't catch that and I'm
usually very skeptical and I'm usually
very skeptical and I'm going to move on
to the $35 bags Oh things get everywhere
so now I'm going to move on to the 35</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
