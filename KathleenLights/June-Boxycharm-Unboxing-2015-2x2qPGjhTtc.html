my June boxycharm unboxing also also
look at my necklace my sister actually
surprised me with this during the
weekend
it says hashtag 1 million and it was
like a little gift that she got me for
reaching a million subscribers pass like
some possessed like if Khloe Kardashian
wouldn't wear it and I like it honey
oh this review thought I just scared
what it is anyway let's get into this
month's books ok so this is what it
looks like this month it says c'est la
vie it's like a nice like beachy theme I
love that boxycharm just like lists the
products on the back and gives you the
prices and stuff it's just so helpful
ok so insolently the first thing I'm
drawn to is like this giant circle this
is a little tub it looks like skincare
chlorophyl lifting mask okay it says as
Laura or s lower I'm assuming that's the
brand I'm probably butchering that but s
lower chlorophyll lifting mask this is a
full-size product and this retails for
$38 that's almost double than what you
pay for the box but anyway it says this
mask is made up of natural milk proteins
plant extracts seaweed extracts and
minerals that tighten the skin it says
to use this twice a week I'm very
intrigued right now I love face masks oh
my god this is like a green oh it feels
like aloe vera and I kind of looks like
it too it's not
Mel's really good oh my gosh let's just
give me a memory and I don't know of
what but it smells good
this is interesting I will update you
guys in a later video okay so next is
this this is a little kabuki brush from
bellapierre cosmetics I definitely have
seen this brand in previous boxes this
is a full-size product it's a kabuki
brush and it retails for $29.99 Sam
Tessa spencey for a kabuki feels really
soft
I actually fun fact I take kabuki
brushes with me when I travel because
it's like so little so I like bringing
kabuki brushes with me like when I
travel I don't really use them in videos
or day-to-day but when I travel they
come in handy okay so this is a guest
like a little sample this is the beauty
crop lightening crew nourished with
pineapple and green tea highlighting
cream this is a little highlight a cream
highlight oh this is full size this is a
full size product and it retails for 18
this little thing is 18 Sam does also
less pensive it says it's 80% water
based no mineral oil no parabens no
animal by-product fragrance free
hypoallergenic variant rate I need to
open this and I want to see what it
looks like I'm extra glowy today I was
actually trying out like a new like dewy
setting spray and whoa I am dewy I'd
have gone overboard but that's okay that
is beautiful
holy crap look at that this would be so
nice to mix in with your foundation cuz
it almost feels like a moisturizer it's
not sticky but then it leaves like a
glow look at that that's really really
pretty
prettiest other weird it has like a nice
scent to it I am very excited for this I
think this would be great as a primer
like to make your skin look really
luminous or mixing with foundations okay
and then the last two things are in the
ah last two things are in this so first
up this is a cargo eyeshadow which cargo
is a really great brand that was sold at
Sephora and I think they took it off and
I think it was sold at Ulta and they
took it off no wait I think cargo may
still be sold out also I'm not sure this
is in the shade Pasadena
I love cargo packaging oh that is pretty
this looks a lot like um makeup geeks
unexpected I was gonna say uninterrupted
wow that is a giant eye shadow these are
like the makeup forever sizes that is
humongous
it's a really pretty light pink but with
like a mob a dusty rose undertone this
is actually really really pretty this is
full size product of course and this is
16 I shadow this is $16 okay and then
the last thing in here is a nail polish
it is from the brand n CLA which we've
gotten this brand in previous boxycharm
box and I really love this brand for
nail polish it is a full-size nail
polish and this is this is in the shade
it doesn't have a specific color but it
says volume 4 on the bottom so I'm
guessing I guess that's the name of the
color it is from their nudes collection
because it says NC la nudes across from
it and it is probably one of the
prettiest news I've ever seen I mean
look at this I am so into this color
what a beautiful what a stunning color
honestly I would show you all my nails
but I just painted them ok guys so that
was everything I got in this month's
Bugsy Sheeran so the overall value of
the box this month is a hundred and
eighteen dollars and you paid 21 dollars
a month for the box
I say it all the time but I don't know
how they make money because that is
steel honestly it's a steel I really
really think that this box is worth it
it's definitely one of my favorite
Watley subscription services out there
most of the time actually like 99.99
personal times you get full-size
products it's actually worth your money
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I was
actually really pleased with everything
I don't know how this is going to go yet
but everything else I know I'm going to
use thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
