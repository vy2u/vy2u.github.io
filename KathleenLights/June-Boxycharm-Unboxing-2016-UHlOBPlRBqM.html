mad boxy shame backs it I woke up today
with every intention of filming this
video then I realized I had to brush my
hair and I was like I really don't feel
like doing that today so I didn't
obviously I just picked my hair up in a
ponytail and hopes that you guys
wouldn't care what my hair looks like
because I don't but we're just gonna hop
right into this box
ah wait look I got myself on the ball my
finger is gonna be on fire now
why are like paper cuts or like cuts
with cardboard just like the worst cuts
well in the struggle almost losing my
finger I managed to get the box open
this is what it looks like so this
month's theme is girls just want to have
Sun that's really cute
first thing is obviously this giant
giant box right here this is a hydrating
coconut gel mask from the brand pharmacy
can you see that can you see this is a
sheet mask I think I've tried the brand
pharmacy before they sell this grant at
Sephora actually and yeah it is a sheet
mask they give you three in the box and
on the box that actually says it's made
exclusively for boxycharm so you can
only get this hydrating coconut gel mask
in your boxycharm that's pretty awesome
I am very excited to use this I'm not a
big like sheet mask person but I know so
many people love sheet masks I want to
get into them more because I hear so
many good things my finger he's on fire
he hurts so much this is a full-size
product and it's $24 it says it provides
intense hydration and restores the skins
natural balance helping even skin tone
and improve overall clarity I'm going to
keep this in the bathroom moving on I
want it the next thing in the box is
actually by Oprah hello I love you Oprah
and it is there pressed powder oil
control it's an oil controlling pressed
powder this is a full-sized product and
it's 3995 I don't know if I'm gonna have
much use out of this because I have very
very very dry skin but I can totally see
why a lot of people would like this
especially in the summertime it just
feels kind of like a translucent powder
let me know if you got this in your box
and if you've tried it and if you like
it if you have oily skin like
does it really control let me know
moving on and the nesting in the bus is
this right here yeah this this is cougar
by Paula dune cougar beauty mineral face
and body shimmer this is a full-size
product and it is $16 it's just a loose
highlighter less open it's like a very
yellowy gold color
oh that's yellow that's like yellow
blend it out it looks less yellow it
scared me for a second it's kind of like
a white gold now that it's blended out
at first it looked like very yellow but
it kind of has like a white gold that's
a really pretty shift I feel like this
would look really nice on fair to medium
skin tones I have never heard of this
