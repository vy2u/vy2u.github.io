to here moon boxing well that intro ever
get old I don't know maybe you guys know
the drill with these videos I basically
try on all the products for the first
time on camera can I give you my first
impressions pretty much so that is what
we are going to do today let's go ahead
and okay mama sake that's okay this is
what the card looks like this one that
says downtown charm Wow
like a Merida I'm getting old I can't
read graffiti I usually have like a lot
of thing to tell you in the beginning of
these videos but not to say I they
thought they would think soon so this is
what the box looks like inside this
month there's a little card in the box
this month where you can say 30% off of
Oprah by using the code box e30 and then
I thought this guy first so this is the
real her playbook shadow palette it is
an eyeshadow palette I'm assuming
oh no I would have a scissor my I'll
Bridal scissors alright let's see what
this says oh I think you get three
options it says eyeshadow palette one
two or three
I got one I'm not sure if everyone's
getting a different one I'm going to
assume yes and this is a full-size
product obviously in this retails for
$28 well I like these colors I like
these colors it's a very neutral palette
they're mainly shimmers but these two
seem like satin finishes and it's mainly
just like bronzes and very very neutral
tones so let's let's zoom in and let's
try out a couple of these shades
okay so right off the bat I noticed this
blends back would you like I notice that
because there are only two like satin
type of colors there isn't much crease
work you can really do unless you dive
into another palette I would say this is
the kind of politic injunction with like
a matte palette I'm going to take the
color strong and I'm going to put this
in my crease there's a lot of kick up
but you know what I feel like that's a
trend these days
yesterday I was playing with the new
naked heat palette and I really like the
look I did but the powers had a lot of
kick up and I don't remember the other
naked palettes having that much kick up
but I really did
like it anything that has nothing to do
with this video but I'm just saying I
feel like the new trend is really soft
shadow even though they have a lot of
kick up I feel like they're just easier
to blend and all you really have to do
is just tap off the excess and you're
fine this is more of a gray crease color
which is quite the opposite of what I
usually do my crease colors are always
either pinky Browns or warm Browns I'm
just going to do something really really
simple I just want to test out the
pigmentation of these not the first
color I would choose as a crease shade
but it's working
now I'm going to take the shape called
proud and I'm going to put that in my
entire lid
I feel like it isn't as pigmented as I
want it to be anything wrong with my
finger maybe that helped it doesn't have
enough of a sheen it's not extremely
pigmented but yeah maybe that's what
you're looking for
I personally don't love that color I
haven't even swatch these I know
allowing new super pigmented that one
right here is extremely pigmented it's
got one down here this one is nice but
it's not as pigmented as this one I
don't know I think for this palette you
have a few hits and misses like I don't
really love this color right here called
the Sun I'm going to take this color
called fine this one right here it's
this first shimmery color I'm going to
use it to highlight my brow bone I'm
going to put the shade fabulous and my
inner corners I'm going to take this
purple color called creative it's a
shimmer but I'm going to take that
underneath my lower lash line and then
last but not least I'm going to take the
black it's called smart and nervous I'm
going to take a little bit of this on
the outer corners
I do like this blood though I mean I'm
only putting it on the outer corner so I
can't really tell if it's extremely
extremely pigmented but it's going on
really nicely I think it's because it's
another set in vintage I think the tomb
satin finishes are really pigmented and
go on really nicely but the rest of the
palette is like full of shimmers I'm
going to take that same black and run
that really close to my lower lash line
okay so I just wanted to test out a few
shades I'm going to quickly put on some
mascara and I will be right back all
right then so I don't know what book 2
or book 3 looks like this one is very
neutral wish there would have been more
satin shades like these because these
were a bit more pigmented and really
easy to blend and I only swatch the
other ones I haven't played around with
this enough but I know just based on
first in person that I probably won't be
reaching for this one much but if you
are someone who has boxycharm because
you rather have just makeup delivered to
your door
you're a beginner you don't really know
where to start then this would be a good
palette for you but personally I just
feel like it wasn't pigmented enough to
love alright so the next thing into both
easy I am so excited when I saw this was
in the box
I like nearly freaked out because I've
always wanted to try one of these
artists toward diamond glow powder this
is in the shade Illuminati I have heard
so much about these little powders this
is a full-sized product and it retails
for $26.99 I am a little bit nervous
though because I hear that these are
sparkly and I'm not like a huge fan of
sparkly highlights but I hear that this
looks like stunning at night in the
light like with flash photography and
stuff so I don't know I might like this
a lot for nighttime let's just try it
out it's a little sister you open it
just like a sticker on this wait okay so
I just wiggled some like right here in
the cap and I'm just going to dip my
brush directly into this this is the
zoeva 1:34 brush Holga
whoa that's a lot more intense than I
expected
holy crap yes have some of that often
try to blend this in I definitely think
I applied way too much product all at
once there I have never used these
before so that was my mistake I think
these are actually better as like a
highlight topper for example we put down
kind of like a natural glow we highlight
and all you want to do is hit the tops
of the cheekbone like right here with
this to make it like extra glowy and I
feel like this is perfect for that
because it is a bit shimmery I'm not
going to lie to be awesome like on your
shoulders this is really really intense
this is not your typical highlight you
want to be very very careful with this
and be very precise because if not
you'll have shimmer like all over your
cheek kind of like I do right now but
this is what it looks like
swatched ignore that little swatch of
something else there that's an eye
shadow but it is really intense and
really reflective okay so then I see in
the box is this and this is a brush from
Luxy beauty we get these brushes a lot
in the box but I don't mind because I
love looks easy oh I miss a little group
actually this looks a lot like the tart
brush that I always use to apply my
blush it doesn't look like it now now it
looks like a golf club but I referring
to this one this is a limited edition
tart brush that I use all the time for
blush that is limited edition and this
one looks like it might be kind of like
a sister of some sort once I wash this
brush and I fix it if your brush came in
your box like this do not be alarmed all
you have to do is wash it and then mold
it when it's wet and then lay it down on
the counter and then when it dries it
will be back to normal don't worry it is
fixable and I love let's see so much and
that is a full sized brush of coats and
that retails for $24 okay we are almost
done this guy's next and I actually own
this already so I'm going to put this
aside and give it to one of my friends
and I'm going to
on mine that is the shade this is the
ofra long lasting liquid lipstick and
this in the shade Santa Anna I love this
color and I don't really wear it that
often and it is so beautiful when I go
grab it so without those winds from Stan
and Matt Rama this is a full-size liquid
lipstick and this retails for 20 bucks
early 1990s and I'm going to pop this
shade on
have you guys ever heard the song catch
my disease by a man called Ben Lee I
cannot get that song out of my head
right now because this lipstick is
called Santa Anna and now I can't stop
singing it in my head
okay so I already knew I love this I
love this formula
Oprah makes one of my favorite liquid
lipsticks they last all day but they're
not drawing they're amazing I love them
so much so I'm so glad we got this in
the box because this is pretty much like
the price of the box almost okay and
then the last thing is is this is a
facial mask from the brand's bio bells
I believe bio Bell Cosmetics three
sheets Maps
oh that's nice so you get three in these
oh yeah your three sheet masks and this
little set retails for $14.97 and I'm
not huge on sheet masks I know it's like
a huge thing I prefer putting on light
Maps I could just wash off but this just
seems so much easier you know okay so
you get why not supposed to moisturize
and help the skin appear smooth and firm
and then you get this one that's
supposed to be like a primer it's going
to help you prep the skin for a flawless
makeup application that's cool
it's supposed to enhance radiance and
minimize pores and even skin tone and
then this one is supposed to enhance
skin's natural glow with Wild Rose and
vitamin C so yes I will definitely be
trying these out in the bath or
something I want to be trying this right
now because well I just don't want to
waste it yeah but definitely let me know

yours yet which one have you tried and
