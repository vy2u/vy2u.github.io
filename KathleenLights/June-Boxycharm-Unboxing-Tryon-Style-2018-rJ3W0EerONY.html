muhfucka Sherman Backson so I am really
really excited for this month's box oh
my gosh I'm sure a few of you guys know
why but I'm just gonna go ahead and jump
into it we're just gonna start we're
gonna start right away because this
month the box is really good the box is
really really good if this is what the
buzz let's light does month and sign
yours the card boxycharm what's up I
don't wait there's a booklet oh yes
there's a theme Oh
Caribbean queen oh I love this oh that's
my face I'm in this photo guys look
that's me right there that's so funny
well this month's theme is Caribbean
queen and that's why I was really really
excited for this month's box because my
friend Gaby her al-ahmad and I know
they've got even volume one palette is
in this month's box and when she told me
I got so excited I had no idea but she
asked me to be a part of the photo shoot
and I was so excited because any reason
to be a part of a Cuban anything I'm
down but all the models that we were
with were stunning so beautiful it was
so funny because I was a lot shorter
than all of these girls like the photo
is an illusion
these girls were all like beautiful so
tall like models like these girls were
models which I am NOT I am 5-1 I'm very
short and I looked like a moron in this
photo because they were all towering me
like these giant beautiful women and I
looked like a little man so I stood on a
box and that's how we got this photo so
yeah this was really fun I'm really
really excited about this box
okay okay this is what it looks like
this month I'm gonna dive into this
product right away this is awesome okay
this is really awesome that we got this
in the box this is from the brand
installed it on a dough I'm sure you
guys I've seen this a million times on
Sephora this is the Brazilian bumbum
cream this smells so - close obviously
but this smells so incredibly good and
it's actually a really great body butter
and I love that they gave us a little
travel size I actually have a little
travel size already so I'm gonna keep
this one closed until I run out of that
one but I really love the scent on this
to me that's what makes me want to use
this it's the scent I think the formulas
really nice
very hydrating but the scent is just so
delicious I love slathering this all
over my legs
and it's always nice to have one of
these like on the go I never go through
an entire body butter like a full tub
never happens I bruh I just I like
travel things but this little guy is $10
okay so next thing in the books is this
this is really awesome because I really
love Luxy brochures I think they're
really good and this is a set of three
of them does a 3-piece flawless
complexion collection and this retails
for $42 one of these tapered highlighter
brushes this one is a duo fiber powder
brush and this is the precision
precision foundation so really quickly I
am gonna use these three brushes I mean
I'm gonna attempt to use them I already
have my foundation and my concealer on
I'm gonna take the 522 brush and my no
filter setting powder from colour-pop
and I'm just gonna set the under eyes I
set them a little while ago like a
little bit just to stop some creasing
but I hadn't really set it set it I'm
gonna contour a little bit with this
5:16 the powder brush even though this
is not something I would usually contour
with but I think I would get a nice
little contour with that I'm gonna use
my Too Faced
sweethearts bronzer and just start
building that up
I feel like because this brush does get
like really thin here like skinny I mean
it's nice to contour with actually like
around here around your temples and
stuff I feel like this would also be a
really good brush to contour your nose
with you know like a general nose
contour not like a really precise one or
anything but oops
I think I did that a little too
aggressively here and I created a shadow
like a dark dark shadow whatever I don't
contour my nose much I'm gonna add a
little bit of blush with this brush as
well I'm gonna dip into this L'Oreal
paradise and chance of scented blush in
just curious I just bought this and just
got it yesterday and when I use this to
apply some blush mmm that's most really
really good it does kind of smell like
the two-faced peach collection but a lot
less it's less sweet it's not as
headachy as the peach collection okay
and then for highlight I'm gonna use the
third brush the six sixty precision
foundation brush and I'm gonna take any
highlight that was in front of me which
was this this hourglass ambient metallic
strobe lighting palette whatever no this
is called gonna dip into this shade I'm
gonna highlight oh yeah love it love
luck see brushes we can now move on to
this okay so I have been talking about
the other mod palette on my channel ever
since Gaby launched it this is Gabby's
makeup brand her own line and I'm so
excited I'm so happy for her this is in
a boxy charm that's freaking epic I told
you guys in my favorites video I spoke
about the automata palette and I told
you guys that I wanted to do another
look with it but then when I realized it
was gonna be in the boxy charm I was
like wait a minute just wait off and do
the look when I do my boxy charm video
so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
put this one to the side me to give it
to Danny stepmom who's been wanting it
and I'm gonna use my I'm not playing I
like got Eva palette I was actually
really really inspired my chola girl
right here um Gabby did her makeup for
this photo shoot and I remember when I
walked into the room and I saw her
makeup I was like you look incredible
like the look that she did she
failure on the inner corners and
obviously on her skin tone it just looks
so much nicer it just pops so much more
like celeea on her skin tone looks
unreal with these two colors on the
outer corners oh my god it just looked
so stunning so I want to recreate that
look or do something similar but and I
don't want this video to be too long so
I'm gonna put some music kick back relax
and enjoy the look
this is such a chop we got like I just
want the beach oh my god Jimmy that I
want to go to the Bahamas I just want to
go I just want to go but really quickly
who's gonna pop this on because this is
the next thing in the box I'm gonna
segue here for a second this is the jump
John John the blue isn't the blue John I
don't know but this is waterproof
eyeliner pencil this retails for $5 and
it's in brown yes well I mean it's
working but maybe because it's
waterproof it's just like really rough
okay so we are almost done with the eyes
but the next thing in the box is
actually a pair of falsies this is from
the brand Paddington and these are the
Munro silk lashes and these are $28 so I
mean that's a sensor for eyelashes but
they look really beautiful and with
these kinds of lashes honestly I reuse
my ardell lashes they're like five
dollars these if you take care of them
just like a hair on my nose these if you
take care of them and you take them off
correctly and you don't like gunk them
up with glue and mascara you can use
these like so many times so I'm really
quickly gonna pop these on
okay so this is the finished look i can
assume you guys out yet because we got
one more product in the box and it is
lace and i'm actually really really
excited for this okay so when i was
recently at a KO polish photo shoot
Gabby had put this lipstick on me and
when i don't know if you guys saw my
instagram stories but when I had like
the fake bangs Amanda had done my hair
like a little bun she used like the ends
of my hair as my bangs and that look
Gabby had put this liquid lipstick on my
mouth either the ofra long lasting
liquid lipstick in the shade for ovince
right here Wow Vidya it's in the Verona
and this a full size product this
retails for $21 but when she put it on
my lips I was like what is that
and she's like Verona from Oprah and I
was like um I don't have that like how
do I not have that but they actually
told me over at Oprah that this is a
brand new shade and I was so excited
because I didn't own it yet so I'm so
happy that I got it in the box and this
color is stunning I wouldn't I wouldn't
wear with this eye look I mean but for
today's video we're gonna do that this
actually doesn't look bad that looks
really pretty
know that I love it it is so gorgeous
this color is stunning Oprah you kill me
you kill me every time okay guys so that
completes this video I did the math well
my calculator did and the overall value
for this month's box is over one hundred
and thirty dollars which is incredible
considering you only p-21 I know I say
that every time but it's it's crazy by
the way I didn't tell you guys the price
of the I love my palette this is only
$28 and I say only because it's
incredible
totally pigmented and you get eight
shadows of deliciousness okay it's
awesome and I totally feel like a
Caribbean queen today this lash how's it
go weird and it's like poking me
this way Oh anyway that concludes this
video guys I loved this month's box my
favorite things obviously was the
palette but this lip is gorgeous and I
also love the brushes the only thing
that I was like was the eyeliner and I
mean these lashes are really gorgeous
but yeah guys that could miss this video
I hope you enjoy it let me know what you
got in your box I mean I think we all
got pretty much the same thing but let
me know if you liked it did you love
this month did you hate this one oh
