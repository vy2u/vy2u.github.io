it's time for my monthly favorites video
these are just products that I've really
been loving all month I feel like I
discovered a lot of really good things
in June it was a very good beauty
related month for me so I'm just gonna
stop talking because I could literally
sit here and talk for like 30 minutes
and I don't want to do that so I'm just
gonna go ahead and start showing you
things that I've really been loving
really quick I just want to mention a
nail polish this is the Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure nail polish in
pink slip it's what I have on my nails
right now it's what I've been obsessing
over this month there is just something
so special about this nail polish I
instagrammed a picture of it I'll put it
in right now which by the way if you
don't follow me on Instagram you should
totally should kathleenlights anyway
it's just like the perfect light wash of
white with a tiny hint of pink it's
called pink slip but it's more of like a
marshmallow a color than anything else
this is what I picture every bride
wearing on their wedding day like this
is the perfect bridal nail polish and
it's so classy and so simple but it
makes your hands look nice and clean I
don't know does anybody else feel that
way when they like put like nice little
classy colors like you just feel clean I
don't know but this is my favorite brand
of nail polish ever from the drugstore I
do love OPI but this is probably in
second place I like this brand over se
this takes forever to chip it's the
complete salon manicure it's the one in
these bottles without a base coat this
will last a whole week on me which is a
lot to say because my nail polish is
strip easily but this particular brand
it just doesn't chip on my nails it's my
favorite my favorite brand next to OPI
love it okay so the next thing will be
no surprise to you but I have been
obsessed with my mac fix+ I have always
used this since the day I bought it I
fell in love with it but I've been using
it a lot more this month just because
when I first spotted I bought it in this
time
a little travel-size one because it was
an accident
I wanted to buy the big one but I bought
it online and by mistake about this one
so I kind of was using it sparingly just
to make it last but since I got a backup
I have just been spraying my face like
crazy I always use this after my makeup
when I do minimal makeup like you know
just mascara and a cup a little bit of
concealer I use it before my makeup and
after it just gives me a nice glow to my
skin and I'm one that hates the powdery
look like if there's even a trace of
like a powder spot on my face like I
look choppy or cakey in any way it
freaks me out so the fix+ really comes
in handy because it just takes the
kinkiness away from your face even
really oily girls I think would enjoy
this it just kind of gives life back to
your skin you just spray it on after
you're doing your makeup and you just
kind of see your skin like coming back
to life like so glowy and young and it's
just my favorite favorite product like
it's one of those things that I always
have to have a backup of like I just I
love it also another Mac product that
has completely stolen my heart it is the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer I got this
it was in my drugstore haul this month
last month in June in the beginning of
the month I hold to this and I said that
I really wanted to try it because I
heard so many good things about it and
everyone is completely right this is the
best under eye concealer I've ever used
in my entire life if you watch any
videos you know that I used to use this
one all the time but it creased on me
and I got into like my little fine lines
when I would take pictures I would
notice when I smile like my little
wrinkles come out a lot and it just
emphasized them so bad and this doesn't
do that it's amazing when you hear of a
full coverage under-eye concealer you
think that it has to crease or it has to
kick up you know that's like full
coverage under your eyes all that just
that sounds deadly but it isn't it does
not crease and it doesn't take up it's
perfect especially for someone like me
who hasn't really dark under-eye circles
it just it covers them perfectly no
creasing that amazes me how this can see
just as increase its $18 but I honestly
think it's worth every single penny
because it does everything it claims its
gonna do okay so the next thing that
kind of surprised me how much I really
did enjoy it is the saint-tropez instant
glow body lotion just as this is just a
tiny little one I got in an empty bag
about two months ago but I didn't really
start using it till June and I still
have a good amount like oh I have like
half of it left and I use it all the
time
the thing is that I don't use it on my
entire body I'll explain this is
definitely like a self tanner
I'll show you put it on your hand like
it's brown but once you mix it in looks
a little scary there but once you mix it
in really well you'll see that it gives
you like the nicest natural looking kind
of glow to your skin it's not it's only
like a tint darker than your other hand
like when you put it on here when you
put it on your whole hand it's only like
one shade darker than your other hand as
opposed to like my saint-maurice or like
the regular San Tropez like the instant
dark mousse you can really tell that
you're getting dark like you put it on
it's it's freakin dark this is just like
the most subtle tan it doesn't smell
like self-tanner which is amazing to me
because I hate that self-tanner smell it
does smell like floral it has like a
perfume scent but it doesn't bother me
any kind of it doesn't linger as much as
like the self-tanner smell but I love
this I should put this on my underarms
because a little weird and the reason
why it's lasted me so long is because
like I said I don't put it on my entire
body what I do is I will put it on my
chest and on my arms not as much as I
did I put like a very big glop right
here when I showed you just to kind of
show you give
the idea of what it does but I put like
a very small amount on my chest and on
my arms and it just gives me like an
instant glow but it doesn't like give me
such a dark tan like you can't really
see the difference on my other body
parts like no one's gonna be like oh
your chest and starker than your legs
like you can't really tell it just gives
you like a nice glow it's just one of
those things I'm really glad I have um
this summer because it's just like an
instantly beautiful soft looking tan and
I think that everyone would really like
that I am gonna purchase the full size
when I finish this and I think it's only
about like $18 I could be wrong I could
be very wrong but I think it's worth it
considering it lasts such a long time
and I I love it I love the smell it's
just it's a really nice product okay so
really quickly I want to mention two
makeup brushes that have been my
absolute favorite brushes this past
month they're both from real tiny Real
Techniques and this one is the blush
brush and this one is the contour brush
this came in the core collection which
is like $18 still very worth it and this
is only eight dollars insane no this
brush is amazing I use it to put on my
bronzer I use it to put on bronzer today
and I also use it to put on the blush
which surprisingly when I bought this I
didn't think it would be good for a
blush because it's like you put it to
your face and it's like oh that's very
big but the fact that it's tapered it's
like fat but then it comes to like a
point I don't know if you can see that
it comes so now I got very not like a
point like you know like this but it has
kind of like the same the Sun the Sun
hates me today
once again
oh it's coming back but it kind of has
like the same concept if you know what I
mean
or it's fat but then it gets you know
kind of thin at the top so when you just
dip your blood when you dip the brush
into the blush very softly at the top
you can really get like a precise blush
application with it and I love the fact
that it gives you like a sheer
application which is what I like with
blush I don't like to look like I don't
want to peck on the blush but that's
just me but you can build it up you can
you can't like look klemish if you keep
doing it
which is good the fact that it goes from
my share to buildable it's awesome and
this contour brush is fantastic it has
completely taken place of my Sigma fo5
this is the small contour brush so you
can tell they're like two completely
different shapes this one is kind of
like more yeah this one is like more
round and like bigger and this one comes
to a point kind of like kind of like
this does this one comes to like a
tapered little point which is perfect
because you can get right into your
contours I didn't contour today but you
can get right there into your contours
and it's perfect and it blends door like
bronzer out amazing you can get like a
very Kim Kardashian contour with this or
you could like blend it out to nothing
which is awesome I really love the fact
that you can just really really blend it
well because I feel like with the Sigma
one you can't blend it so much so if you
are a beginner in contouring and you
find it's kind of difficult to contour
this brush pretty much does it for you
you get the most beautiful contour with
it
it's I can't I can't even say enough
good things about this brush speaking of
the whole contour and blush I love this
blush this is the NYX blush and mob I
got it in my Ipsy bag this month and I
was so freaking happy that I got this
blush because I have been looking for a
blush like this it's just a obviously
it's like a mauve color but like a very
light pinky mouth color this is the
swatch right here I think it complements
my skintone pretty well when I put it on
my face and it has like a very light
glow to it but it pretty much looks like
a satin type of blush to say it here on
the back of the blush no I doesn't say
but yeah if it seems like just like a
satin finish which I love because it
does give me like a subtle kind of glow
it's not like completely matte I have it
on my cheeks right now what you probably
can't tell because I always put like you
know minimal blush on that's just me and
the quality of this blush is amazing it
feels like butter like when you touch it
it feels so smooth and it's like $7 if
all the other powder blushes are like
this I am definitely going to go pick up
some more NYX blushes because I love it
and I honestly think it's the perfect
color get your fair skinned or like
medium to fair mostly fair I think that
that blush would look beautiful on you
okay also in the same blush bronzer
family I have been loving my ELF
contouring blush and bronzing powder
recently which is crazy because well
usually during the winter I do not touch
those sites
I don't the bronzer is very deep so I
rarely ever use this this is like the
original one I know that now they come
with like a bunch of different colors
but this is like the original one that's
supposedly comparable to like the NARS
Laguna
and orgasm do all that they have I have
been loving this so much this is a very
very dark bronzer and the blush is very
very light and it's actually very
flattering see if this is crazy
pigmented and the fact that it's three
dollars it just makes me happy but this
is only three dollars because you get a
lot of product that had this forever and
it lasts so long because it's so
pigmented but what's amazing about this
is that at first I was like you can't
contour with this this has like some
sort of shimmer in it but you notice
that when you put it on your face and
you start to blend like when you start
to blend away on your contours and stuff
the shimmers of the bronzer completely
fall like they go away the shimmer goes
away completely so it really is perfect
for contouring $3 I think it's
completely worth it pigmented amazing I
love this especially in the summer I
love it okay so this next thing I'm
really excited about because it's
awesome and it is the philosophy purity
made simple one-step facial cleanser Wow
it is one of those milky type of
cleansers where it doesn't really foam
up which is what I like because I have
dry skin and cleansers that really foam
up dry out my skin even more so I don't
like that but this stuff is phenomenal
that's what this is this is phenomenal
the first time I use this I saw a huge
difference in my skin like um I have
blackheads on my nose and they're not so
much big but they're hard to get rid of
like I have troubles getting trouble
getting rid of my blackheads and not
that this completely took them away but
after I use this and I looked in the
mirror I looked at my nose and my
blackheads were a lot less visible and I
was like shocked I was like oh my god my
skin has improved so I've been using
this I'm posting my skincare routine on
Wednesday so if you're interested in
knowing all the stuff I use that's
that's gonna be posted on
say and the entire month I've been using
this and this is like permanently in my
skincare routine I don't know if I will
ever use a different face wash at night
because I use it at night because it
takes off all of your makeup in one step
and I've never had a face wash that does
that literally it just breaks down all
of your makeup and just takes it off
while cleaning your skin very well at
the same time while not drying it out so
you take off your makeup and then you
your skin feels so clean but hydrated at
the same time it's just it's a miracle
product it really is and I'm so so happy
that I picked it up I probably will love
this brother okay so if you watch my
videos you probably know that I am
obsessed with my Maybelline master
precise it's like the liquid liner in
pen form I think it's perfect it's
amazing and I used to be more into gel
eyeliner until I discovered that little
pen and I was like oh but recently I've
been kind of mixing it up and I've been
using gel liner too and I have been
obsessed with the Maybelline eye studio
gel on Jo gel liner in blackest black
and this thing this is freaking black
okay when they say black is black they
ain't kiddin like really look at that
line black this stuff is awesome um I
used to really like the elf cream
eyeliner but they dry up really quickly
like there are three dollars so it
really doesn't it doesn't bother me that
much but the fact that they dry up so
quickly it's kind of annoying so I
decided to go ahead and get the
Maybelline eye studio one because I've
heard really good things about it and
it's ten times better than the elf cream
eyeliner and honestly I do not think
that the Mac blacktrack fluid line is
worth buying because there are so many
other black gel liners out there that
are even better even blacker and they
they do the same thing really and I've
really been liking using the brush it
came with it's actually a really good
brush and it gives it makes the flick
really precise like you can get a really
really thin nice flick out line with
this brush I think it's awesome very
very black lasts all day it does not
like it's perfect okay so I only have
one more thing to share with you guys
and I'm sorry I already know that this
video is long but this is my favorite
thing out of everything that I've showed
you this is what I loved the most in
June and I'm so excited about it I'm so
happy that I finally found something
like this that I really love and before
I get into it I cannot tell you a little
story I know you hate stories but I I
have to tell you this story in order for
you to understand why I'm so obsessed
with it and why I'm so happy that I
found it before I show you what it is
okay so for years and years and years I
have been obsessed with the red can
smooth down butter tree this has
macadamia oil in it it's smoothing
treatment for very dry unruly hair this
is like a leave-in cream I like leaving
creams more than like leaving sprays so
basically you just put this in how I do
it is I put this in my hair when I get
out of the shower after I wash my hair I
just put this in my hair and it makes my
hair so smooth and so soft and just
manageable not tangley at all it's like
it is what I would have considered my
miracle product up until recently but
it's what I've always used it use this
for years it's like the most amazing
leave-in cream amazing and unfortunately
read ken discontinued the entire smooth
down line the entire smooth down line
which I love the heat protected in that
line this is my holy grail hair
treatment I was devastated
okay I called my mom and I was like mom
they discontinued the smooth down line
which means the butter tree is gone and
she was like what because she uses it
religiously to but they do have what is
called smooth LOC like that's the new
line but what they just continue this
and got that it's like smooth LOC and
they have something called butter silk
and I read reviews on the Redken website
and people said that did not come here
to this I doll everyone said that just
to save your money because it didn't
come here so I didn't buy it and I've
been trying to
for things that are even comparable to
it or even on the same level of goodness
but that is and I just could never find
anything but I have not only not only
have I found something that is just as
good as my butter treat I think it's
even better and it is the Frederic
Fekkai glossing cream this is a tiny one
this is pretty freakin expensive this
little one is nine dollars but this will
last so long you just need a pea-sized
amount I've had this one for over a year
and I'm halfway done
you only need like about this much and
you just put it all over your hair and
you're good so I first discovered this
product when I got a sample of it when I
ordered off the Volta they sent me a
sample of this and the first thing I
tried it out was the blown away I was
like no way no way no way something
makes my hair feel as good as my butter
treat does but yeah anyway this has
completely changed the way I feel about
my curly hair I don't know if you guys
have noticed but I've been wearing my
hair naturally curly in a lot of my
videos and I'm talking about naturally
curly like that is my hair with just
this stuff in it that is all I have in
my hair right now I just washed it last
night put some of this product in when
it was still damp I used this one it's
my hair is about 50% damp 50% dry so I
just put it all over my hair I even work
a little bit into my my bangs because my
bangs can get a little frizzy into my
bangs and stuff like that and then I
just let it air dry and this is what it
air dries to I did curl my bangs today
so you can see like right here and right
here I did curl my bangs because many
banks no matter what I do they stay a
little frizzy but that's all I did my
hair is naturally curly right now I just
I didn't use any other product besides
this and no other product not even my
butter treat has made my hair looks so
good by itself natural with no gel with
no mousse with no hairspray just natural
like that no other product test
to my hair and I'm just so happy that I
found this honestly even if you have
pins straight hair give this a try it
gives your hair the most beautiful shine
so soft it makes it really easy to
detangle so manageable like you just run
your fingers through here and your hair
feels so healthy shiny and smooth I
cannot say enough good things about the
event of Frederic Fekkai glossing cream
I'm gonna go buy the Frederic Fekkai
brilliant glossing shampoo and
conditioner that I've heard are amazing
as well so I hope the shampoo and
conditioner is just as good as the
glossy cream so yeah those were my
favorite beauty products of the month of
June I hope you like this video I hope
