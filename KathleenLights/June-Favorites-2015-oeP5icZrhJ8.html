my June favorites these are products
that I have been loving in the month of
June and I'm really excited for today's
video because I am like extra excited
about all the things I'm going to be
talking about like I don't love all
these products I love all these products
by the way my lights back there are dead
and I change the battery like what the
heck is that
maybe I just replaced them with like old
batteries I don't know but I'm so
disappointed I love those little lights
and what the heck was the point of my
batteries if when you change them
nothing happens anyway I don't want this
video to be a million hours long I have
a feeling this is gonna be such a long
video because I have so many things to
talk about so I'm just gonna get started
I'm gonna try to breeze through these
things but hey so I'm gonna get started
with this guy right here I have been
obsessed like completely obsessed with
this palette this is an eyeshadow
palette from the brand zoeva
and it is their cocoa blend palette they
have a bunch of different palettes and I
have been sent a few of their palettes
and I haven't been blown away by like
any of them to be completely honest with
you guys but this one I am in love with
this is what it looks like on the inside
it is full with my kind of colors
everything is super warm and the quality
is really good all these eyeshadows are
fabulous like I was so so impressed with
this color here because this is a pure
gold eyeshadow it's called pure ganache
and if you have the original Naked
palette at least in my Naked palette
half-baked like the gold eyeshadow
called half-baked is just so chunky and
it's so hard to use I love the eye
shadow but to me it's hard to use this
one is a beautiful gold similar
undertone and it just glides onto the
eye it's amazing my favorite ones are
these three right here pure ganache
substitute for love and freshly toasted
and then I really love subtle blend and
beans are white that's a weird-ass name
this is the palette I have on my eyes
today and this is also the palette I
used on my eyes earlier in the month
I filmed my random favorites I also
posted a picture of my makeup on
Instagram and it was using this
eyeshadow palette I am gonna film a
tutorial on that look because it was so
highly requested so that video should be
coming up soon I have this color as my
brow bone highlight and this is such an
intense like vanilla shade I I really am
obsessed and I wanted to show you guys
something today because what I have been
really loving about this palette is this
eyeshadow right here called sweeter end
and it looks like just a regular taupe
eyeshadow it's so strange it doesn't
even look like it's gold but it's a
beautiful gold and I have been using it
to highlight my cheekbones I know it
sounds really weird but watch I'm going
to show you I didn't put on a highlight
today specifically so that I can show
you this watch Chinese on Xbox if you
hear him
and it looks purple like this eyeshadow
looks purple I don't know if you can
tell doesn't look purple like do you see
that do you see that
I'll show you get not right I don't know
if you can tell but that just made my
cheekbones glow oh I love it okay so now
I'm going to talk about lip gloss says
lip glosses even though I'm wearing a
super matte lip that's okay
the other day I was at CVS and I was
looking at the NICS section and I
noticed these mega shine lip glosses and
I remember people talking about them a
long time ago
but then after the butter glosses came
out like nobody cared about these and I
think it has a lot to do with the fact
that 99.9% of them are shimmery I only
saw two that weren't and I picked up one
of them and I love this lip gloss this
is in the shade natural it looks exactly
the same way as it does in the tube and
this is such a me color right now I love
this like ma vie pinky color I love the
fact that this is not sticky whatsoever
yet it does have like the opacity that I
want it to and this smells like the red
starburst which is my favorite starburst
I have just been wearing this a ton on
days where I'm like bear
even have any makeup I just throw this
on my lips and my lips look super glossy
and I love it okay so I have been
obsessed with elf recently I have been
discovering like new elf stuff and elf
really has been stepping up their game
they're so affordable and I really
really love it
and more lip glosses I I have discovered
these and I love these these are the elf
extra lip glosses they stuck me three of
them and then I loved them so much that
I purchased the other three on my own
these are very very basic lip glosses
which is why I like them but they have
really good pigmentation they're not
sheer but they're not like the Anastacio
ones that are like full on color they're
more glossy which I really like
a lot of them do have shimmer in them
which can throw some people off but that
doesn't bother me at all I have been
wearing this one the most this one is in
the shade Joe and I like these on top of
lipsticks I don't like these by
themselves but whenever I find that my
lipstick just needs a little bit of
glossy touch I always like just reach
for these and just throw them on the
center of my lips and then tap them out
Joe is a really pretty peachy shade and
I also really really love Brian it's
just like a basic midtone pink and these
are only two dollars more elf stuff I
have two more things from elf that I
have been blown away by I'm serious and
the main thing being in this elf
blending brush holy crap guys this feels
like Sephora Pro brushes actually
Sephora pro brushes has a brush that
pretty much is identical to this it's
short just like this it looks just like
it and it's like triple quadruple the
cost this isn't all over fabulous brush
I used it today to contour which is what
I've been using it for you would have
seen me use it in a tutorial already but
this just bronzed of the skin I just bit
my tongue into her perfect contour
because it's not super skinny so you
don't get a very harsh line this is so
beginner friendly and even if you're not
a beginner and you want like a diffused
contour something not so harsh this is
your guy I
I've been so impressed with drugstore
eyebrow products recently I feel like a
year ago the drugstore did not have good
eyebrow products and the elf instant
lift brow pencil is something that I
have been enjoying last month I featured
the NYX micro smoothing what does it
call the micro brow pencil I do like the
next one a little bit more than the elf
one as I prefer like a waxy brow pencil
like the Anastasio on the Anasazi one of
course is my all-time favorite I don't
think anything like beats it it's my
favorite but if you are on a budget the
drugstore is stepping it up
so this one is a little bit creamier in
consistency as opposed to waxy so some
people will like this even more than the
next one this I think two to three
dollars the only thing that throws me
off is that there's no cap on this and
like there usually is it's just this I
have the shade neutral Brown it's what's
on my eyebrows right now and I have it I
have like a powder on top of it and
something else I'll share with you later
on okay so now I'm jumping to the
complete opposite side of the spectrum
I'm gonna talk about something that's
very expensive this is the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist and out of
everything this month this has been by
far my favorite thing I saw Jaclyn hill
of course because Jaclyn hill like is
the reason I buy so many things she
posted about this on snapchat and said
that she was loving this new like
luminous skin miss thing and then she
showed everybody what this was and then
I texted her and I was like hey how bad
do I need that how bad do I need that
and she was like it's really good but it
makes you super dewy she's like girl it
is dewy and I was like okay then that
means I definitely need it so I went
online and it was a pretty penny but I
purchased it this is like 48 bucks which
is crazy for a setting minister for like
a mist but this mist is like no other
like I'm not even joking this liquid is
like white if you look at it in the
bottle it's like a white liquid and it
almost comes out like a moisturizer
it's a mist and it feels like a mist it
feels like water but it also feels very
very very moisturizing it's not one of
those mists that you miss your face and
you feel great and refreshed and then
all of a sudden it's like water it goes
away no this makes you luminous the
second you split display you spray this
on your face I use it before my makeup
to give myself like even more moisture
and then I spray it after if I want to
look extra dewy it's not gonna make it
greasy or anything but it's definitely
gonna make you do it I have it on my
face today like when I was done with my
makeup I sprayed my entire face and it's
so luxurious it's like it's like nothing
I have I don't know it's amazing and it
helps that the packaging is like the
cutest packaging I've ever seen on a
product in my life it's glass it's so
fancy and I love it it makes my skin
feel great especially since it's so dry
okay my next favorite is something that
kind of pains me that I love so much
because it's pricey mmm this is the
Moroccan oil dry shampoo and this one is
for dark tones which is a big reason why
I like it I needed one rule so that is
so bad if you guys have been watching my
channel you know that my favorite dry
shampoo ever is the batiste dry shampoo
it's seven dollars even cheaper if you
find it other places and it's great it
really gets my oils and it's just great
this is amazing first of all this smells
so good like spraying this on my hair is
honestly is it's a joy because the scent
is so good it smells like Moroccan oil
I'm crazy about the scent but I love the
fact that it's not like stain II some
dry shampoos that are for dark tones
like stain my fingers Brown that's why I
never use them
this one doesn't do that and it just
makes you hear if you're really soft it
takes the oils away this makes your hair
look really nice and fresh and it also
gives you a little bit of volume I'm a
I'm not even kidding I love this a
little bit more than my batiste one but
I will continue to purchase batiste
because obviously that's cheaper than
this but this I do like more so let's
talk about bronzy stuff this is the
Maybelline Dream bronze BB cream this is
a tinted
moisturizer pretty much but it has that
brown bronzy tint to it it has SPF 25 it
did a whole video on this I have been
loving this when I'm tan this is just
too dark for me when I am NOT tan I have
mine in the shade that's light / medium
maybe they have a lighter one I'm not
sure but this makes my skin glow if
there's not much coverage to this so I
only like to use this mixed in with
foundations or other tinted moisturizers
other BB creams because by itself it's
like just like brown on my face but
mixed in it gives my foundation a nice
warm bronzy feeling and it also gives my
skin a dewy luminous glow I have I'm
really really into this it's the perfect
mixture with my foundations and BB
creams I love it this is the Clarins
radiance + golden glow booster
made-to-measure self tan I spoke about
this on snapchat like weeks ago I am in
love with this product I don't know what
I was doing before this product
basically what this is okay so you self
tan your entire body right you add your
self tan you're nice and tan self-tanner
breaks me out on my face it clogs my
pores it doesn't really break me out but
it clogs my pores so I don't like
putting it on my face all you do is
after you've self tan and you're getting
ready to go to bed you open this little
thing and then you scoop out your
moisturizer that you're going to apply
to your face like your nighttime
moisturizer and then you drop like two
to three drops of this in your
moisturizer and you mix it all around
and then you apply your moisturizer to
your face and then when you wake up in
the morning your face matches the rest
of your body your face is nice and tan
it's amazing it doesn't clog my pores it
doesn't break me out it's made for the
face but it gives my face a nice golden
glow that matches my tan but my face
isn't brown or streaky or caca I don't
look dirty it's fabulous I love this so
much more bronzer stuff this is the
bourgeois bronzing primer serene sent
this to me from the UK Thank You Serena
I love it I really freaking love it I
have been using it over my Chanel
vol no my Chanel 10 solution Elton
Deschanel the cream bronzer from Chanel
Chanel owns bourgeois so I'm not
surprised that these products are so
freakin similar but this is so much
cheaper this is what it looks like it's
just a moosie bronzer it's like a creamy
I want to say it's a cream I'd say it's
like a mousse texture is beautiful to
bronze your skin with I like using it
with my Real Techniques sculpting brush
that I spoke about in my last eight
months favorite it just makes your skin
look sunkissed and I highly recommend it
if you can get bourgeois where you live
because this stuff is good so Too Faced
came out with these love flush
long-lasting 16 hour blushes and this is
what they look like they look like
little polly pocket blushes I freaking
love the packaging but I actually really
love the product the blush is actually
amazing they came out with six I believe
and these two are my favorites
this one is called baby love it's a
really pretty natural blush there pretty
much goes with every makeup look they
last forever on the skin I don't know
about 16 hours but they do last a really
long time the formula is good and this
one is my favorite favorite favorite
favorite one this one is called I will
always love you and it's a really pretty
peachy color with golden shimmers in it
but it doesn't look glittery on your
face it looks glowy the shimmer like
translates into like a nice glowy
complexion it's the blush I have on my
cheeks right now actually and I freaking
love it this is the thing I mentioned
earlier that I have on top of my brows
on top of the elf brow product and like
some powder I put this to set the powder
and the elf thing okay this is the
Loreal brow stylist plumper brow gel and
mascara I wanted to talk about this in
my last month's favorite and I
completely forgot I've been using this
for two months straight I freaking love
this I alternate between this and my
Anastasia tinted brow gel I love them
both I have mine in medium to dark this
thing is so similar to the benefit gimme
brow to where it has little fibers on it
and then you
just comb through your brows and it
makes your brows look a little bit
thicker while adding color to it
and it also sets your hairs in place
it's amazing I found mine at Ulta okay
so this product I'm about to talk about
is pricy and I don't typically by Marc
Jacobs cosmetics I don't know it just
really has never been my thing but of
course I was watching YouTube and my
friend
Laura from mrs. Lowell in here on
YouTube she was talking about these
twinkle pop things from Marc Jacobs
specifically this one in the shade 3
shakes
this one's called 3 shakes and she was
talking about this and completely sold
it to me in one of her videos it's
pretty much like a crayon stick like an
eyeshadow stick amazing like amazing
amazing amazing I think honestly it's
worth the money these little things like
20 something dollars this says that it
has glacier water in it and I believe it
this has a cooling effect when you put
it on your face even when you swatch it
on the back of your hand your hand feels
cold it's the weirdest thing but putting
this on the eye especially in the
morning and like wakes up your eye
you're like whoa because your eye feels
nice and cold I don't know it's freaking
weird but it's really awesome
the cooling sensation honestly is my
favorite part but this color is
beautiful it's called three shakes like
I said and it's a beautiful chocolatey
deep dark bronzy color with a little bit
of like gold flecks in it not chunky or
anything but it's gorgeous I have this
smudge underneath my lower lash line I
love using it like that and I also like
using it on the entire lid by itself it
sets quickly and then it dries and it
does not budge and I also like it as an
eyeshadow base I loved this so much that
I went out and got this one in the shade
vulvar which is just a typical champagne
gold I have this right in my inner
corners today I just love the cooling
sensation and I love the packaging very
sleek and very fancy this has been such
a hit for me this month I got this like
two weeks ago so I think I'm kind of
like cheating but this is the ex1 and
visit where
liquid foundation the foundation I'm
wearing on my face right now I have mine
in the shade f-100
I spoke about it in my foundation video
so I don't want to go too much into it
but it's been the foundation that ever
since I got it this is the foundation I
have been wearing it's honestly it has
become one of my top five favorite
foundation it just looks like skin on
the face doesn't feel heavy doesn't feel
cakey doesn't feel tacky it just if you
look skin I love it it's awesome and it
also looks really nice with a tan
because it does other shades are good
for like olive skin tones okay let's
talk about two more things and then this
video is over I feel like I've been here
forever so because it is summer now and
even in the springtime especially in
Florida like you are in the Sun a lot
and it's so important to wear SPF and I
want to talk about the SPF that I have
been wearing on my face I do use a
different SPF from Sun bum on my body I
use like 50 on my body from Sun bum and
I use like a chemical SPF on my body but
on my face I like using a physical SPF
and my favorite one by far so far has
been the Josie Maran Argan daily
moisturizer SPF 47 this is a physical
SPF which is my favorite for my face
because physical SPF do not break me out
chemical SPF every time I put them on my
face they clog my pores so bad physical
ones are a lot more natural for the face
they just don't break me out they're
better for sensitive skin I highly
recommend physical SPS let me tell you
the difference just in case you don't
know a chemical they're both really good
a chemical SPF absorbs the UV rays and
then like releases the bad stuff a
physical SPF doesn't absorb the Rays
they just completely block it some
people don't love physical SPF because
physical SPF I feel like I've said that
a million times come out like super
white and it gives you that white cast
that sometimes chemicals don't you blood
it in you could still kind of see it but
honestly when I'm at the pool I'm not
really wearing me
up and I don't care about that I care
about my skin not breaking out and my
skin being protected so I don't care if
there's a little bit of a glow to my
face when I'm in the pool and I love
this one by Josie Maran because it's so
hydrating on the skin a little goes a
very long way and it doesn't dry out my
skin it just sinks right into my skin
and my skin feels nice and plump and
moisturized love that it's 47
super-awkward that it's 47 and not like
45 or 50 but as far as them okay so the
last thing I want to talk about okay so
let me tell you a story last month or
the month before I'm not exactly sure my
recent haul where I did like a huge
freakin haul
I bought the healthy deodorant from the
brand la vanilla Sephora was selling
like too many sizes and I wanted to buy
it because I have just been hearing so
many bad things about aluminum in your
deodorant and why you should switch to
aluminum free deodorants and while
there's so many chemicals and Durance
and aluminum and your deodorants cause
cancer and on stuff and honestly I'm
someone who thinks like dude everything
in life causes cancer just live your
life the way that you want to live it
because everything causes cancer these
days and huge your destiny is your
destiny but if you can sort of prevent
things and you could help yourself a
little bit I'm all for it
so I tried out the healthy deodorant
from la vanilla cuz it's aluminum free
and it just didn't work for me it was
the original vanilla scent and then so
many of you guys in the comments were
like no you need to use it consecutively
for like at least a month and a half
before you start noticing it working
because your body has to release all the
toxins that normal deodorant gives you
like the ones with aluminum and all the
chemicals in it like secret and all
those other things your body's not used
to not having that deodorant on so while
you're using a natural deodorant it's
gonna take a long time it's gonna take
some weeks for your body to release the
toxins and for it to actually work so I
was like you know what I'm gonna truck
through I'm gonna smell bad for a month
and a half I don't care it's not like I
go anywhere I'm home all day and a few
weeks ago I was watching a video by
makeup by Tiffany Deane and she was
talking
about how she loved the healthy
deodorant and how she noticed a huge
difference switching over and that her
favorite was the vanilla coconut scent
how the original one didn't work for her
it still made her smell bad and the only
one that really masked like some Bo was
that the vanilla coconut so I ran out
and bought the vanilla coconut and
actually got this one from the LA
vanilla website because they didn't have
it at Sephora calm but oh my god I agree
with her 100% this one is so much better
than the original vanilla it does not
smell like coconut to me I know actually
like at all but this one doesn't make me
smell bad I don't know if all my toxins
are released already or what but this
makes my armpits smell good for the
entire day I really loved the vanilla
coconut one and I'm so glad that I'm
like over those chemical deodorants and
I'm using something that's 100% natural
nourishing no aluminum no parabens so I
just want to sell you that story that I
listen to your advice to everybody who
told me no continue using it and
eventually it will start working because
it has okay guys I'm sorry this video is
so long but these are the products that
I really really really really been into
this month and I love absolutely
everything leave me a comment down below
telling me what your favorite product of
the month is and maybe I'll check it out
