my June favorites these are all products
I've been loving in the month of June
and excuse what's happening behind me
okay so look how cute that is this is a
canvas that I got at Hobby Lobby it says
be the light and I love it and it's
beautiful and I'm gonna hang it up on
the wall and then I'm gonna add lights
kind of like how I had them before but I
need to look up like better quality
lights because the lights that I've put
up there in the past have faded really
easily like they just die very fast so I
need to look for really good quality
lights I'm gonna hang up my little
canvas it says be the lights gonna be
nice and light II and I just quickly
place that canvas there to hang it up
and I didn't get to hang it up before I
found this video so it's just sitting
there and that's okay so without further
ado I'm gonna talk about the products
I've been loving I want to talk about a
pair of falsies I have been using and
abusing these are the lashes by the
brand kiss they sell this brand at
Walgreens they're mostly known for their
like fake nails they make like a
press-on nails and recently I have just
been loving these lashes they're called
camellias they have a bunch of different
styles camellias are my favorite I'm not
wearing them right now I should have
worn them right now but I've worn them
in a couple of other videos they're
awesome they're so natural and beautiful
it has like different angles it says it
has multi angle technology whatever that
means it works great they kind of mimic
real lashes because of that multi angle
look I love them they have the perfect
volume the perfect length they're
seriously so stunning the only thing I
will say about these is that they're
kind of hard to put on because they're
so thin they're very flimsy so they kind
of like wiggle really easily and that is
the only thing I don't love about them
that they are kind of difficult to put
on even though they are so thin and
lightweight I feel like that's what
makes it so hard oh another bad thing I
forgot to mention because they are so
flimsy they're not as reusable as I wish
they were like my Arda wispies I can
wear them like 80 times in a row not
literally but I can wear them a ton
these I could only wear like two times
in a row before they're starting to look
a little crazy mo besides those two cons
I just love how they look on the eyes so
I love them my next favorite is a little
bit shocking to me because I've kind of
did
like this product in the past well not
this one specifically but I'll get into
it this is the Urban Decay eyeshadow
primer potion in the shade enigma and
enigma is my favorite that enigma is the
one I specifically love I have not been
a fan of the urban decay primer potion
in the past I used to like them and then
I realized they're not that great for
priming like the original one is not
that good this one I truly truly love
and I don't know why I don't know if it
has a different formula or not it does
make my eyeshadow last all day and it
does intensify my shadows as well the
main reason I love this is because of
its color it's really similar to the one
they have in Eden only Eden is very very
yellow I was looking for the perfect Mac
painterly paint-pot dupe that wasn't as
drying and I feel like I found it in
enigma let's talk about a blush that I
cannot put down I don't know if I will
ever use another blush in my life that's
extremely dramatic that's and that's not
true
the second I bought this and I applied
it to my face I knew right then and
there this is one of my favorite blushes
in the entire world definitely top five
that says that's a bold statement but
definitely top five and it's affordable
this is the sleek blush in the shade
suede if you guys are a fan of warm
colors warm blushes and you don't own
this go buy it right now this is the
blush I'm wearing on my cheeks today
this is the most pretty salmon nude it's
like a very muted peachy orange that
pairs with so many different looks you'd
be surprised it pairs with like
everything and the formula is really
nice this is a matte blush but it's not
drying I got this one on Amazon and I
honestly like found it randomly I wasn't
even searching for and I was like that
looks like a really pretty color but
it's so much prettier in person than
what it shows on Amazon I cannot get
enough of this lush it's the only blush
I want to wear like it's the only one I
want to wear I want to talk about that
for the rest of the video definitely my
all-time favorite
okay let's talk about highlighting
products the first product I really want
to talk about is this guy from Becca
this is one of their shimmering skin
perfectors in liquid form and this one
is champagne pop this is pretty new it
came out with the whole like champagne
glow collection with Jacqueline Hill I
love this way more than I thought I was
going to it's definitely hands-on my
favorite liquid highlight that Becca has
way more than moonstone opal like I love
this one it looks so pretty on the skin
without having to put a highlight on top
it gives your face a very healthy dewy
glow but it's intense at the same time
like it does give you a nice highlighted
look I've used this kind of as a primer
and I've used it on the high points of
my face as a highlight and it's just
wonderful wonderful wonderful this
champagne pop it's so delicious like
that's how I can describe it it's
delicious my next favorite is also a
highlight but not technically this is
actually an eyeshadow trio this is the
jcat triple crown baked shadow in the
shade dousset de leche it's a big dive
shadow with three different colors you
kind of have like a more champagne pink
a more muted gold in the middle and then
like a super intense reflective white
gold there at the bottom and holy cow I
love this I've been using this as a
highlight to highlight my face since I
got it I've been using it like all month
my favorite way to use is just kind of
swirl all three colors together because
I find that it makes the perfect
champagne gold you could even use this
wet I don't use this way because it's
super intense as it is like dry this is
the highlight I'm wearing on my face
right now the second i swatched this on
my arm like to use as an eye shadow I
was like wait a minute
that would make a fabulous face
highlight and it has and it's the only
thing I've been using it for I'm sure
it's nice as eyeshadows as well but I
love the glow it gives my face
I love it my next favorite is a
concealer and I don't think I've been
wearing this for the entire month
actually I know I haven't but I haven't
stopped wearing it since I got it which
says something which means I totally had
to talk about it this is the Too Faced
Born This Way naturally radiant
concealer this is a pretty new release
from Too Faced this is in the shade fair
and I have been using this concealer
like every single day it's the concealer
I'm wearing right now I feel like this
is one of those concealers that you will
either love or not love I personally I
think it's amazing I wish it had more
coverage than it does I will say that I
think it has medium coverage I wish it
was full coverage but I can look past
that because I love the way it sits on
my skin it does not make my under eyes
look cakey at all like it's very
hydrating without being like a weird
dewy concealer it does look naturally
radiant like it really does I didn't
think I was gonna like this because I'm
not a huge fan of the Born This Way
Foundation I have it and I try to love
it but for some reason that foundation
and me I don't know what it is it looks
a little heavy on my skin this does not
you know what this reminds me of the
NARS radiant creamy concealer the
Maybelline fit me concealer and the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer like
combined feel like this is the offspring
of those three concealers it's not as
liquidy as the Urban Decay one but it's
not thick like the NARS one is it's just
it's just really really pretty and
really nice and I just I really really
like it oh I forgot to mention this when
I was talking about the highlight okay I
have been loving this brush for
highlighting let me tell you this is the
morphe g37 it's one of their gunmetal
brushes and I think this is one of their
new ones I love this brush I love this
brush for highlighting I've been using
it to highlight my face and this is also
really really really great to set your
under-eye concealer with powder it's
awesome it's also really great to bake
with it's great to contour with if you
want a super chisel precise contour
really nice these gunmetal brushes are
very inexpensive and this one is
definitely one of my favorites I have a
10% off code for morphe it's
kathleenlights I always have it down
below another favorite of mine I feel
like everyone needs this palette in
their life this is the Anastacio modern
renaissance palette and it is hands down
hands down my favorite palette anastacio
has ever come out with for some reason I
didn't get this as PR I always get
honest ah ciose new releases but this
one never made it to my house so I just
went out and bought it myself because
all the deliciousness
that kept popping up on my Instagram
when I came to this palette I was like I
need that and I do not regret it it's my
favorite this one is pricier than her
palettes in the past but this one has
two extra eyeshadows or for extra
eyeshadows I don't remember so that's
why it is pricier there there's more
product in it definitely worth the money
these colors they just pair so well
together I'm wearing this palette on my
eyes right now and even though it
doesn't look like extremely wearable to
me it does but even though some people
might think it's too red it's too warm
you can totally wear this in a natural
way today I didn't use any of like the
red shades it just stuck to the neutrals
these shadows are very powdery they just
have a lot of kick up when you put your
brush in like kind of like explodes a
little bit with powder thing but with
that being said they are still very very
pigmented and really easy to blend all
of her palettes have been
limited-edition in the past I think this
one is permanent which is amazing I
would have been so sad at this with
limited edition and I'm pretty sure that
some of these colors are actually new
and not shadows that she already has in
her collection okay let's talk about
some lip products this guy right here I
love this I briefly spoke about these
glosses in a recent drugstore video but
these are from flower beauty and they
are called doesn't say here but I'm
pretty sure these are the lip lacquers
or lip radiance lacquer glosses I love
them so much they're really glossy
really pretty this one is definitely my
favorite this one is classic nude I'm
wearing this lip gloss right now / stark
naked by Urban Decay one of their new
lipsticks and I love this gloss I've
linked to add more had to retouch their
they're so glossy and so pigmented as
well like I don't think you need a
lipstick underneath this to get like
nice full color and to me it's not
sticky whatsoever which is probably why
they don't last as long on the lips I
have to reapply like every two hours
which is not a big deal because it's lip
gloss it's really easy to apply it it
just throw this in my purse and reapply
throughout the day seriously love these
pick up classic nude if you haven't such
a pretty nude the other lip product I
want to talk about is this guy right
here I've been wearing other lip
products that I can't really talk about
yet the majority of the month so when I
wanted something with
a little bit more shine I've gone to the
flower glasses or to these little
Tubby's these are the morphe cream lip
polishes they came on with a ton of
different colors they're in this cute
little to be thing where you just
squeeze out the product and they're only
$4.99 they're super inexpensive and they
pack a punch it gives you kind of like a
shiny lip color but it doesn't feel like
it's a gloss on the lips like it just
feels like a very pigmented lipstick
this is the one I've been wearing a ton
this one is in the shade blush it's the
perfect soft spring pink and I just
checked on the morphe website like i sat
down to film this video and I wanted to
know how much it costs so I looked it up
on the morphe website and this one is
sold out hopefully this comes back in
stock because this color is so so
beautiful and for something so
inexpensive I think it's totally worth
checking out okay so my last favorite is
actually an SPF if you know me you know
I am like an SPF freak I'm like a
vampire going on into the Sun like I
don't like to be burnt and it's crazy
because I used to be the complete
opposite I was so reckless now I'm all
about the SPF life and I love this if
you guys haven't tried this I totally
recommend trying this out this is from a
brand called super goop they sell this
on Sephora that's where I bought this
this is the Forever Young body butter
with sea buckthorn broad-spectrum SPF 40
moisture rich whip restores dry skin
improves skin texture and prevents signs
of UV photo aging I love this so much I
wish it was SPF 50 I have a thing where
like I really love SPF 50 for some
reason I don't know if it makes a huge
difference from SPF 40 to SPF 50 maybe
not I love this because it really does
what it says it's it really does restore
dry skin there's so many like sunscreens
when I put them on
yeah they sink into the skin but it's
kind of like it's gone once it sinks
into the skin either it leaves a greasy
residue or it's just like gone this
honestly feels like I'm putting on a
body butter like a delicious body butter
but it's not greasy it's not slippy it
doesn't leave like a weird white cast it
sinks right into the skin but your skin
feels soo
moisturised really really great SPF and
perfect for travel I've used so much of
this it's so good so yeah guys that
