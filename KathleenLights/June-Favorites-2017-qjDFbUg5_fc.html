my June favorites I'm going to talk
about all the products I was loving in
the month of June I can't believe is
June I feel like I was just buying
Christmas gifts and have quite a few
things to talk about so I'm just going
to get started but before I do I want to
quickly mention my ko polish summer
collection is officially out I will have
the website down below I am currently
wearing m.i.a on my nails right now just
this color right here thank you guys for
all the love and support that you've
shown me it's been a really fun launch
and you guys are just the best so I just
wanted to mention that it is currently
available I will link below oh and Zoe
is back in stock and so is that's what
she said which means the spring bundle
is also back in stock because I know
I've gotten a lot of questions about
that so we are good to go alright now
let's Joby I have been so into this
primer and I didn't think it was going
to be a primer I loved so much this is
from the brand touch and soul this is
the no I always say this wrong no poor
blem primer like no problem
but no problem you know because of the
poor failing primer I like the name and
I also really love this bottle by the
way this has the most beautiful
packaging this frosted bottle is
everything and I love how it says it in
pink and the product is like a baby pink
it is so cute I love it and you know I'm
not someone who really loved pore
fillers I don't like the benefit
professional I really don't like the
Smashbox pore filler but this is
different
this is like a porcelain for dry girls
it has a pump by the way which is
awesome the consistency of this is very
slippy but it looks matte so it's not do
we or anything I don't explain it it
looks matte when you apply it to the
skin it doesn't give your skin any shine
so oily girls don't be afraid but some
poor filters will bottle up on your skin
and will dry my skin out like if they
don't have enough moisture to them this
one I feel
fills in your pores but also smooths out
the skin really nicely and gives you a
really amazing base to apply your
foundation I really have been loving
this I don't think this is a makeup
extender but it is such a nice canvas to
lay your foundation on and I have been
using this non-stop I love it I even
keep it right here
I'm so into it I'm old I want to quickly
mention this little guy because it is
limited edition and I feel like it's
something everyone needs if you are into
warm tones this is the pretty cheeky
face palette by Sonia Kashuk
I spoke about this in a drugstore haul I
bought this at Target and I love it
they're really really pigmented powders
but they're not hard to blend out you
get a blush a bronzer and a highlight
and I love all three shades which is
really rare for me to find a palette
where I like all of the colors combined
but I really do this blush looks really
crazy and orange but with a light hand
it looks stunning the formula is really
really blendable I don't think the
bronzer comes on too strong I really
love the undertone as well and it's
really hard to get a good highlight at
the drugstore some of them are really
powdery or they're too chunky or they're
just not enough this one has the right
amount of Sheen without being too much
it's just I love this little trio it's
so good my next favorite how many of you
knew this was going to be in this video
how many of you I am addicted to this
powder I cannot stop this is the Kat Von
D lock-it blotting powder and I have
mine in the shade light this has become
my favorite powder to make my pores
disappear which is so crazy to me
because the cosmetics bye bye pores
press powder has been like my Rowley
Grail for so long and I think I'm going
to say it I think I like this one a
little bit better but just a little bit
better I like it this one actually
matches my skin tone I know it looks
really light right now on camera but it
doesn't light in my foundation when I
apply to my skin this makes my pores
disappear even more than my eye by a
porous powder and even when I tried this
out for the first time on camera some of
you guys are commenting like oh my gosh
I just saw your pores disappear when you
put that powder on and I felt the same
way
I love this I feel like every time I put
my makeup on now I have to put this
powder on top not cakey it's very finely
milled it feels creamy but not thick
it's like perfect and it doesn't even
claim to be a pore filling product it's
just a blotting powder I actually don't
use it to blot you guys know I have very
dry skin so I never really get oily but
for pore filling it's amazing and you
need it I think I've discovered
mascara of my dreams at least my
drugstore dreams
this is giving Mikiko extra school
volley mascara a run for its money let
me tell you I love that one but still my
holy girl that's my favorite affordable
mascara but this is coming close you're
like running side by side this is the
l'oreal voluminous lash tara dyes
mascara and i know you've heard a
hundred people talk about this already
but it is that good I highly recommend
this you need this in your life if you
are looking for extreme volume it makes
your lashes so sick I'm wearing this
mascara on my eyes right now and I love
it I feel like I don't really need
falsies when I wear this and I really
appreciate that in a mascara because I'm
not someone who really wears falsies all
that much so I mean my mascara telugu
fun story actually one time I was in LA
at an event and someone came up to me
and was like oh my gosh are you not
wearing falsies and I was like no I'm
just I'm just wearing mascara and the
person was like to an event you know
where you're not wearing falsies and I
was like no I never just kind of like oh
that's weird and I was like why I don't
get it
and that day just made me realize that
there are so many people in the beauty
community who think that we all should
look a certain way or we should all do
our makeup a certain way like we're not
clones we don't all have to wear falsies
you can wear mascara to an event if you
want you know and I just thought I'd
share that with you but I love this
mascara see this is the kind of mascara
I don't mind wearing to an event without
falsies I was really really surprised to
love this foundation so much this is V
Natasha Venona foundation X and I'm a
huge fan of Natasha's and eyeshadows and
products I had her original foundation
in the past and I liked it
but it wasn't my favorite this one is
way way better than her other foundation
at least in my opinion this is full
coverage and it has a fruit complex and
I'm usually the shade light beige most
of the time but now that I have a little
bit of a tan like barely there but it is
a little bit I mix in ugly
medium to get my perfect shade and I
love the packaging I love the frosted
bottle I am so into frosted even though
I'm clumsy and I dropped everything I
break everything I love the look of
glass bottle I don't love them to travel
with but they are really pretty it comes
with a pump and this formula is really
nice I thought I wasn't going to love it
because it says full coverage and I
heard a lot of people with oily skin
really liked it but I find out this does
really work with my skin I do have to
use a moisturizer underneath most of the
time I am wearing the Kiehl's ultra
facial moisturizer like this is my first
step then I go in with a primer and then
I go in with this and it looks beautiful
it looks flawless like completely
flawless to has great coverage it
doesn't look as natural as like my
makeup forever face and body foundation
that has like barely any coverage this
still does look like foundation but in a
really natural flawless way I find that
this lasts a really long time on my skin
I will say though I always have an issue
where foundation kind of sinks into my
smile lines here like all the time and
this kind of settles in there a little
bit but not too much it doesn't break me
out it doesn't feel heavy Natasha this
one is a really really good one
speaking of foundations I have found a
new sponge that I love I mean I love all
the sponges that's talked about the
equal tools one is awesome I love the
Real Techniques one although I feel like
they might have changed it they
definitely change the pure one I don't
like that one anymore I love the Beauty
Blender I love discovering sponges but
oh my gosh I think I have fallen madly
in love like madly in love this is the
flower beauty ultimate sponge that's
right this is from the drugstore flower
beauty it's owned by Drew Barrymore
brand has its hits and misses but for
the most part I really do love flower
beauty and they nailed it with the
sports so soft it is dampened right now
because I used it to apply my foundation
and then I washed it not very good color
so it goes my foundation there but I
wanted to show you it like nice and
clean because it is the most beautiful
lavender color I usually do not like
sponges with this shape because whenever
I see this shape at the drugstore most
of the time it's really really stiff
it's hard to dampen like it doesn't
really expand this one does expand
really nicely it's a lot smaller than
this when you buy it when it's dry but
usually fun is with this shape are
pretty stiff this is so soft like I'm
sure you can't tell on camera but it is
really squishy really really soft it
just applies your foundation so nicely
because it doesn't like punch your face
the density is just right it is so
perfect it applied my foundation
flawlessly I love this combination I
think I might like this one more than my
Ecotools one I like the equal to one
more for its shape I don't love this
like I love this shape but it's so soft
and squishy I love them both actually I
love them both the same they're both
amazing and this is just as good as a
beauty blender and it's half the price
so definitely check this out okay so
this is really bizarre but there's only
one lip product I want to mention most
of the month I've been wearing like bold
colors if I'm going out I just put on
like some mascara and like a bright lip
but when I haven't been wearing a bold
lip I've actually worn this a lot this
month this is the okra long-lasting
liquid lipstick in the shade below this
is the nude I feel like Oprah was
missing in her liquid lipstick range it
is the most beautiful nude it has the
perfect undertone because it's very
neutral although it looks pretty cool
okay I would say it's neutral cool like
it has a cool undertone but it's not
gray and it doesn't make you look dead
or washed out some cool can get too cool
this is like the perfect amount of
neutron coal it is awesome it pairs with
so many different eye looks especially a
really really intense smoky eyes this
looks beautiful I wore this to an Urban
Decay event the other day and amelia
actually wore this color to my kale
polish summer launch party that we had I
mean it looked awesome on her too so I
feel like it does work for a ton of
different skin tones i me it is a little
darker than it is on her but I still
think it looks awesome on both of us and
it's such a good liquid lipstick I loved
Oprah's liquid lipstick you guys know
this obviously but especially their nude
colors because they're so hydrating and
so creamy that they just look beautiful
on the lips okay and then the last three
products I want to talk about our
skincare related this is a product I
recently got from Sephora I've only had
this for like two weeks but I wanted to
talk about it so bad this is the Benesh
lip sleeping mask and it is really good
I wear this every
before I go to bed at least that's what
I've been doing for a few days now and
when I wake up in the morning my lips
are not only more moisturized but they
look like plumper not plumper and like a
little bigger but they look more supple
and they look like they have less lines
in them because they are more supple and
plump and hydrated I truly love the
outcome disc is my lips and I know that
it's pricey it's $20 for a lip map which
is crazy but this is such a big little
tub I feel like I will never run out of
this so you paid $20 but it lasts
seriously like such a long time and it
comes with a little spatula so you're
not dipping your finger into this which
I also really love it has this little
like stopper thing that you put on top
and then has the product inside I always
like dip my spatula in the same place
this does become one of my favorite lip
products at the moment I cannot stop
using it and it smells like a bubble gum
dream it smells like a bubble gum
smoothie oh my gosh this scent is
amazing I will say that is the first
reason I started loving this as I was
sitting I was like this is Mel Boone and
I just really love what it's doing to my
lips and I just wanted to mention it
before that because I have been using it
a lot and I wanted to tell you about it
okay I know this is cheating I know this
is this is super cheating so I just
recently opened this in an Ipsy bag not
that long ago so it's not a June
favourite but it is a massive favorite I
can't stop using it ever since I got it
in my Ipsy bag cake beauty ink and it is
they're delectable soft soft soft
triple moisture body lotion in the scent
coconut and cream and I have finally
found my dream cream this smells so so
good and it okay there's a summer in the
tube I feel like I'm at the beach so
good and I do find that the scent does
linger not in a like repulsive way but
like that beautiful coconut scent does
stay on your body for a little bit and
it's like not just coconut it's coconut
and a bunch of other summery goodness
stuff not only do I love the scent that
is a major reason why I love it but I
love how this feels on my skin I am
someone who completely hates the feeling
of lotion and I think that body butters
are a little bit too sick for me as well
I know that I have dry
again so I should like that feeling of
being hydrated but when it's on my
fingers or when it's too greasy when I
feel heavy I hate that feeling
this is perfect this sinks like look at
this look at this like my skin is dry
but it feels hydrated it sinks right
into the skin and I'm actually going to
be going on to this Website cake beauty
and I'm going to buy a few things from
this brand because it really really
intrigued me when I tried this out and I
loved it so much how many of you guys
tried cake Beauty like is it good you
have a ton of things on their website
and I can't wait to play with it because
I've been - oh and you know what's even
better this is not not better than this
but since I'm not a favorite I just got
this but you apply this to your body and
then you grab this fine fragrance mist
by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and the shade at in
the shade in the scent at the beach and
oh my gosh the combo of that cream and
this it's like the fit you are all ready
for vacation my keys get you my but
anyway the last product o products
actually I want to talk about are these
so this is a little drunk
elephant pouch that came in a kit with a
ton of mini versions of like drunk
elephant products so I want to talk to
you guys about this kit I purchased this
kit myself I do get PR from drunk
elephant but I bought the kit myself I'm
trying to look for it on the sephora
website just to see what the price is
because I don't remember okay yes it's
called the littles kit and it is $90 and
I know that that is crazy $900 that's
insane but you do get to try out so many
amazing drunk elephant skincare products
and the only reason I purchased this
because I already own the full-size
version of most of these products but I
purchased it because I do a lot of
traveling unfortunately just getting
none unfortunately I'm just terrified of
airplanes I'm very grateful for how much
I travel that sounded mean I'm sorry I
just I'm so scared of airplanes but I
travel a lot at least a lot for me I do
turndown a lot of things I know other
bloggers travel way more but it's a lot
for me and I was finding that carrying
around my drunk elephant product so it's
like a mission and a half is a lot to
carry when it's full-size products but
with this you get a ton of mini
and it's so easy to travel with because
you just throw it in this little bag you
get the marula face oil the Umbra SPF 30
sunscreen the TLC from booth glycolic
night serum which is like my favorite
you get to see from a day serum this one
is also good and you get the B Hydra
intensive hydrating gel this one is like
weird I don't know if I like this
product or if I don't so I don't really
use this one and then you get the la la'
retro whipped cream little moisturizer
which I use this every single night
before bed I love it you get two of
their bars you get the juju bar and the
P key bar pecky bar these are the only
two products I have never tried from
drunk elephant leave me a comment down
below if these are any good because I
still have these like in the wrapper
I've never tried this but my friend
Stephanie swears by I think it's this
one so let me know what your thoughts
are on these products like do you wash
your face with it I'm just scared
because I have really dry skin that like
the soap bar is gonna dry my skin out
because it's like a bar you know I did
recently try out their new face cleanser
the packaging is awesome I love the
concept but I think I don't like it I
really do think I don't like their new
bestie jelly cleanser I think it's
drying out my skin a little bit so you
might see that in a disappointing
product soon but I'm still testing it
out but the rest of these products are
amazing I love drunk elephant I just I
just wanted to mention this because I
find it so useful to have mini versions
of all my favourite products and I'm
assuming this kit is limited edition I
don't know if it's going to be out
forever and if you've been wanting to
try out this brand I think this is the
perfect way to do that and yeah that's
what I've been using I haven't been
using this all month obviously because I
only use this to travel but I purchased
it this month and I thought it was
amazing so I wanted to share with you
guys but if that completes this video
these were all the talks I was loving in
the month of June leave me a comment
down below letting me know what your
favorite product was in June and maybe
I'll check it out but that can wait
video guys thank you so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye sir a body lotion in the shade
no innocent I'm sure you can tell
that fine friggin Smith son of a bitch
