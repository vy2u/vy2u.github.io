my Ipsy bag and Maggie it's late right
it's like like 21st of June I'm so sorry
this video is getting up late but I
don't get my Ipsy bag like on the same
day every month it like changes every
month this month I got a little later do
you guys like my earrings I posted about
them on Instagram aren't they fabulous
Nick Miller is on my ear I love them I
got them on Etsy I don't remember what
shop I got them on
oh darling designs got them on Etsy
randomly searching new girl stuff and I
love them and about them also another
side note my nails are so bad you're so
dry I just took off my nail polish I was
wearing like blue nail polish just took
it off and this blue nail polish was a
biatch to remove I was there for like a
good while trying to take it off and
then I just dried up my nails and I used
non acetone nail polish remover don't
know why the fields will dry and they
look so bad okay anyway that's jump into
this oh well this is the card look how
cute katie is on the card this month
lustre luxe
I am loving this card it's really cool
say graffiti and the bag is like a
graffiti theme it says if see makeup
it's so cute I actually really like it I
think it's funky lays open so the first
product I see here is from a brand
called Peter llamas why does that sound
so familiar to me this is the youth
revival 5 oil hair treatment mask for
dry damaged hair with all-in-one vitamin
hair complex dry damaged hair that's me
I want to smell it this nostril is
actually stuffy so like trying to smell
it on this smells like a hair mask
actually a little fruity I like the
scent in the ingredients it has like
apple extract shea butter a ton of
different oils a ton of different things
I can't pronounce either but like how
does different oils doesn't seem to have
silicone in it which is awesome
dimethicone and all those things when
they put them in hair products
it kind of just coats your hair it
leaves your hair feeling really soft and
silky but it's just kind of like a
coating it's not really repairing your
hair or moisturizing your hair
much so try to avoid things with
dimethicone or any silicone in your hair
products so I'm very excited to use this
it's so late free paraben free and I
love hair masks this is the perfect
traveling one and I hope it's good
I just went to like show you the bag and
then this popped out and I didn't even
know like can you see it there is a
color pop product in the Ipsy bag this
month what what am I so excited about
that this is a cream gel liner in the
shade get paid I already have this I own
all of the color pop eyeliners they are
my favorite eyeliners they're so good
and so inexpensive get paid is like a
really pretty rose gold if actually I
think that I used this in a tutorial not
that long ago this is only five dollars
I'm gonna list the prices below like I
always do in every FC video it's just I
don't get a card that says the prices on
it so I don't know how much anything
cost this I know is five dollars which
is half of what you pay for the Ipsy bag
a month so I'm so excited that this is
in the bag
this is an amazing amazing amazing
eyeliner i love i love colour-pop
eyeliners and i didn't even know they
were gonna be an FC this month that's so
exciting
okay next thing into back all again this
right here this is an urban decay
eyeshadow it says lounge eyes shadow is
it I don't know if this is the name of
the eyeshadow oh it's little okay so
it's like a mini Urban Decay eyeshadow I
thought it was full size but no no it
doesn't say anything like on the back of
this but I'm pretty sure the name of it
is lounge and I have a slight feeling
that I own this already like it looks
very similar to an urban decay shadow
that I currently own this color is very
similar to like Mac's club this is nice
because it's a little like magnetic pan
shadow that you could just stick in a Z
palette I've actually I like the size of
this came in but I pretty sure I own it
so before I swatch it or do anything
with it I'm gonna make sure next up in
the bag is this right here this is from
a brand called be a bombshell I've only
heard of this brand through epsy I've
been subscribed to Ipsy for like three
years now and be a bombshell is a brand
that I see pretty often so this is a
lipglo sized thing
doesn't say it just says be a bombshell
doesn't tell me water needs it's in the
shade famous and I'm going to open it to
see the texture because I don't know if
this is like a new seed product or a lip
gloss or what these are really really
pretty color though oh yeah this is
definitely a lip gloss and a really
pigmented lip gloss at that this is more
of a light swatch right here and this is
two layers of the gloss right here
it smells like suntan lotion oh my gosh
it smells identical to Banana Boat or
something what you don't mind I love the
smell of suntan lips it's crazy
anyway really really like this color it
would look really pretty with like a hot
pink lip liner and then you just layer
this on top to give your lips kind of
like a nice shine doesn't feel sticky
either like you can tell this is more of
a creamy lip gloss not super glossy or
sticky and then the last thing in the
bodies these this is from a brand called
rodeo road aisle this is their stem-cell
cleansing cream two-in-one cleanser ant
mask for dehydrated skin with stem cells
rosehip and vitamin E I already have a
face wash that I use currently in my
skincare routine that I love but I'm
always open to trying new products it
says massage a small amount onto dry
face and neck rinse with warm water or a
damp muslin cloth to use as a weekly
mask apply a thick layer and leave cream
to absorb for 15 minutes rinse with warm
water okay I'm definitely gonna try that
out we shall see rodeo rodeo rodeo rodeo
oh okay I still doubt with everything I
got in this month's Apes tea bag I have
to say I'm very excited for the bag this
month I really like the products I got
very happy with the Urban Decay
eyeshadow I got even though it isn't
full-sized I mean how often do you go
through a color like this not that often
and you get a color pop eyeliner in your
bag this month so very exciting leave me
a comment down below what you got in
your FC bag this month did you like it
did you hate it like what's your
favorite month or whether you're like
least favorite month I want to know
