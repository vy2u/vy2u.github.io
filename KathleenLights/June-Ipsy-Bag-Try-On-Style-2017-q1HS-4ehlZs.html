my seabag unbagging you guys know the
drill with these videos I like to try on
the product on camera for you guys and
this month this is what the package
looks like I actually really like the
bag this month by the way I think my
voice is going away I spent a lot of the
day yesterday screaming at Porter to be
quiet because he's just so loud anyway
like I was saying actually really like
the bag this month and then when you
open it you get a little card so it
doesn't say anything about the product
and I really wish it did but it says if
see June 2017 volume up is like the seen
but the first thing is the bag assisting
and this is from the brand hey honey and
I'm pretty sure I've seen this brand at
Ulta or maybe I'm going crazy but I
think I have and it is the uncovered
detoxifying mud mask it's supposed to
clarify and detox skin of imperius and
it's for normal to oily skin types and I
have very dry skin so I'm a little bit
worried about this just because when I
was looking at the bag earlier there
aren't many things I could try out for
you guys so I thought you know what I am
going to try out this mask usually I
don't try skincare product on camera
just makeup set but why not it says
apply to the face avoiding the eye area
and then leave it on for 10 to 15
minutes until dry and then rinse I'm
probably going to leave it on for 10
minutes I'm not going to hit the full 15
because I'm a little nervous I'm afraid
to skin dry out my skin but I won't know
until we try it alright so I know I'm
going to do this so I wash my face
before I set it down
and then I did my eyebrows so my face is
clean let me do it I'm going to take
this spatula brush thingy from Tarte it
came with one of their like face masks
and I'm going to use this little Rory
side to apply the face mask oh it's very
very runny you know extremely liquidy I
thought it was going to be a lot thicker
like more mud like that smells really
strange smells like something very very
familiar
I'm not going to apply this to my entire
nose because I get so dry right here and
since this is for oily skin I don't want
to provoke my nose so only gonna play
right here at the top and I'm also going
to avoid that area in between my brows
because I get really dry right there as
well
all righty then so now I'm just going to
leave this on my face for about 10
minutes I'm going to wait for it to
completely dry and then I'm going to
come back and show you guys what it
looks like dry and then I will rinse it
off and hopefully hopefully this doesn't
air might irritate my skin or anything
like that so I will be bust okay so this
has been on my face for ten minutes it
doesn't dry down like a typical mud mask
that gets really hard and cement like
where you feel kind of tight it doesn't
really do that some areas are still wet
but like if you hear it's dry and it
almost has the feeling of like a
peel-off mask that's a little strange so
I'm going to go ahead and rinse this off
like it says to do and I'll be right
back and tell you what I think
all right so I just finished rinsing off
the mask and obviously it's just the
first time I use it so I'm not sure if I
like it or not I have to use it a few
times to see if it really does anything
but I did notice that when I was rinsing
it off it did exfoliate my face like I
was massaging her off my face it has
tiny little like sand particles in it
that exfoliate the skin I didn't notice
that until I started to take it off so
that part was nice and it didn't feel
like it was irritating me but it did
leave my skin with just a little bit of
redness I kind of had a few blackheads
here on my chin and it didn't completely
take them away so that's a little crappy
because I do have other masks that I
feel like really detoxify my skin this
one I feel like this a job in a less
aggressive way so so far so good I do
have to play around with it just a
little bit more I'm just going to
quickly let my skin and breathe for a
few minutes minimum moisturize and put
on the rest of my makeup before we
continue to dive into this bag so BRB
again for like the 10th time alright I'm
back I feel like it's taken me hours to
film this video and these are usually
such short videos so let's continue we
reopen this alright so the next product
in the bag is this guy this is the
delectable soft soft soft
so it says right there triple moisture
body lotion in the scent coconut and
cream it has shea butter coconut oil
aloe vera ooh I love aloe vera and it is
a how many paraben GMOs mineral oil
Oh Liam and yet with seedless oh sorry
yeah after that mmm I love anything
coconut scented this smells like summer
vacation oh my gosh lips let's just
lotion myself up shall we
oh it's I mean it's lotion it's not as
thick as like a body butter but my is it
just smells exactly like sunscreen put a
lot there let me just put some on my
other arm fun fact about me really
quickly as I'm putting this on I
absolutely hate my feeling of lotion
ever since I was a little girl every
time I used to apply lotion to my body I
used to wash my hands immediately
because I hated the feeling of lotion on
man and I still kind of do like I still
hate that feeling I don't know why this
smells delicious it smells exactly like
Australian gold or like Hawaiian Tropic
but a little bit more natural like it
smells a little better
literally summer in a bottle I really
like the scent of that and I'm not crazy
about sunscreen sense but this one's
going to smell like that chemical
sunscreen it just smelled like summer I
don't know it smells really really good
and I mean this doesn't have any SPF in
it so it's not like it's like sunscreen
made my arms feel really really soft it
has sunk into the skin but it doesn't
feel greasy or too thick or heavy it
actually feels really lightweight and
really nice like kind of like how this
feels and then just look how it smells
all right it does so the next thing in
the bag is that this is a mascara from
the brand Pier and it is their fully
charged mascara powered by a magnetic
technology whatever that means and now
that's the higher Sable's to open things
but alright let's try this out I
actually think I received the full size
of this one and I never tried it out I
believe I gave it to my mom so I'm not
sure how this performs let's see
okay so I do like this mascara but I
don't love it I think it does a really
good job of lengthening but I don't see
much volume I mean it does look a little
bit voluminous but I don't know if you
can tell but my lashes look a little
thin like they don't look full and
dramatic and that's what I like in the
mascara so maybe if you like length
versus volume you will really like this
but for me I like either a little bit of
both or a little bit more drama a little
more volume so not my favorite but
definitely not the worst mascara we ever
used it's pretty good alright so moving
on the last me know almost last thing in
the bag is this guy this is a nail
polish from what it looks like
no moon delete this is a nail color from
the brand Margaret dabs
I've never heard of this brand before
but this color is beautiful I love it
I would totally try it out for you guys
today but I'm already wearing nail
polish it is a stunning rich teal color
and on the back it says treatment
enriched nail polish it's formulated
with vitamin E and wild rose botanical
extracts to help strengthen and protect
the nails free from harsh chemicals
while leaving the nails with the
wonderful lasting scent of rose what
obviously I can't smell the rose now
because it smells like nail polish
usually scented nail polishes you can't
smell the scent until it's on your nail
but anyway that's really really cool and
I like that it has benefits in the nail
polish so that's nice I like the
packaging - I love this gold cut okay so
we have one more product in this bag and
that is this just cutest little thing
ever this is a tiny tiny little blush
from the brand of the balm and this is
their in stain blush and this one is in
the shade pinstripe I have one of these
interesting blushes in my collection
already it's like a vibrant peach color
and it is so good they last forever on
your skin I'm saying your cheek but it's
stay
gone for a long time so this is what the
color looks like it is a tiny little
product so getting your brush in there
might be a little difficult but it is a
beautiful mouth tone blush let me get
that brush there's my favorite blush
brush it's from Tarte it was limited
edition which totally sucks but I'm just
going to you know put my entire brush in
here because it's a little little
rectangle little does go a long way I
think that little blush might last you
awhile actually so up good I like that
color
I usually don't love like mommy blushes
like this I have a few in my collection
I really like but I'm more of a nude
blush where or if I do wear color it's
like peach or warmer shades but I really
really like this I think it's very deep
but okay joy so that completes this
video this was everything I got in this
month if see bag like always I will
leave everything down below I will leave
the prices of each product down below
well like the price of the full-sized
products like I always do and yes let me
know what you got in your FC bag of this
month did we get some other things did
you like your bag did you hate it let me
know in the comments below I really like
the bag this month the only thing I was
like about was the mascara and the face
mask but the rest seems very promising
