tutorial on this look it is using the
masquerade palette by dubious place I
love this palette it has so many fun
colors and when I first got this I was
like okay I definitely see myself using
these colors all the time but for
today's video I thought I would step out
of the box and use like the blue shades
in the palette so this is the look I
came up with and I really hope you guys
enjoy it and yeah I think that's all I
wanted to say so if you want to see how
to get this look then just keep watching
okay so we're gonna prime our eyelids
I'm using the Urban Decay primer potion
in enigma just to cover up the veins on
my lids you guys know and then I'm
taking the masquerade palette by dubious
place I'm going in with the shade
Burkina I think that's how you pronounce
it and I'm just buffing this into my
crease this is going to be by a
transition true that this color is very
pigmented so I'm just starting off a
little by little and then building that
color into my crease I also find that
raising my eyebrows helps my eyelid
stretch and it helps me blend out the
shadows better fun little tip next I'm
going into the shade zobo and I am
applying this into my crease as well I
just want to add a little bit of purple
leanness to the look so I'm applying
that into my crease I'm going to take
the shade Dahlia on a really small
crease brush and I'm starting to pack
that onto my crease because when I apply
this on my entire lid I want it to blend
seamlessly into my crease so adding it
to my crease first really does help and
then with a shader brush I am applying
this to my entire lid I'm going to go
back into zobo and I'm going to do the
same thing I did earlier just applying
this into my crease I really love how
the blue mixes with the purple and it
creates like a darker purple I love how
these colors look together so I'm just
applying some of this into my crease and
blending it into the blue I'm going to
take that first shade we used and I'm
applying more of this into the crease
just to add a little bit more of that
Brown and to blend out any of the harsh
edges of the purple and then I'm going
to intensify the lid shade again by just
adding some more Dahlia
I'm gonna take this minty shimmery
turquoise color called Molly and I'm
applying this just to the very center of
my eyelid I love how this looks on top
of that other blue I think it gives such
a pretty dimension to the look so I'm
just applying some of this directly onto
the center of my lid and then I'm tight
lining with my NYX treasure Li gel black
liner and then I went in with some
eyeliner this is the English L liner
number 77 and I'm going to create a wing
with this I almost feel like it's
impossible for me to do a wing on camera
but you can skip this if you're
uncomfortable with eyeliner I just you
know did a basic a basic little wing I
went in with my tatcha luminous dewy
skin mist just to spray this on my face
before I went in with primer because the
foundation I'm going to be using is a
little bit matte so I wanted a luminous
mist underneath my primer which was the
NYX angel veil primer by the way and now
I'm going in with Foundation and I'm
mixing two shades of the new Urban Decay
all nighter foundation I'm mixing 3.0
and 3.25 I'm having some skin issues at
the moment and this foundation does a
really nice job of just covering
everything up I love the coverage it's
awesome now I'm moving on to concealer
I'm going to use the collection lasting
perfection concealer and I'm going to
mix it with the wet n wild highlighting
and concealing pen the collection one is
awesome because it has really great
coverage but it's also a matte finish so
I find mixing it with the wet and wild
one it's just easier to blend and I love
the combination of the two I'm sorry I'm
blending on my concealer and I'm
watching rain that CW show about like
the Kings and the princes and all that I
was currently watching that I'm on
season two like Episode five still no
sign of Marion bash but what can I do so
I'm also adding some in between my
eyebrows on my nose and on my chin that
was the wet and wild concealer and I
just blended that in and I'm going to
set my under eye concealer using my H&amp;amp;M
powder this is the perfectionist
finishing powder and this is in the
shade porcelain I got this shade because
I thought it would be great to highlight
underneath the eyes it mattifies the
skin really well but it's nice and
brightening too
really like this powder powder powder
okay so to finish off the eyes I'm
taking the shade Burkina on a pencil
brush and I'm buffing this underneath my
lower lash line and then I'm going to
take my NYX choice early black liner
again and I'm just adding this to the
waterline and I'm going to take this
shade called Chi and on a smaller pencil
brush I'm focusing this really really
really really close to my waterline but
on my skin just buffing that underneath
my lower lashes and then I'm going to
add the shape da Leo right on top I like
how these two combined makes kind of
like a dark navy blue so that is why I
mix those two shades and then I added a
little bit more of that brown shade just
to blend everything out put on some
mascara and then I highlighted my inner
corners with the shade géza such a
beautiful like iridescent oh my god I
love this eye shadow but anyway I
applied some falsies these are the
christina wispy lashes they're not for
everyone but I actually really really
love these eyelashes so now I'm just
going to move on to the rest of my face
makeup and I am going to contour my
cheekbones using the Cavanaugh Kwan
sculpting powder in the shade light the
original shade was called medium but now
they came out with like an even lighter
shade which is awesome because I think
it is perfect for my skin tone to
contour it's literally perfect I like it
way more than the medium shade but to
bronze up the skin a little bit I'm
going to take my Too Faced Sweethearts
bronzer and I believe this is called
sweet pea
or it could be sweet tea I don't
remember but it's one of those and I'm
just using that to bronze up the skin
and give me a little bit more warmth
for blush I'm using the NYX powder blush
in the shade terracotta I haven't used
this in so long and when I used it today
I was like why haven't I use this I love
this blush it gives you such a pretty
warm glowy flush to the cheeks to
highlight the tops of my cheekbones I'm
going to take the over highlight in the
shade Beverly Hills and I'm just popping
that on my face and I'm also
highlighting my nose and my Cupid's bow
with this and then we could finish off
this look with my lip color I'm going to
first line my lips using the essence
lipliner in the shade in the nude and I
kind of over drew my lips just a bit and
then I applied the colour-pop ultra
satin lip in the shade point zero right
on top but let's complete this video I
