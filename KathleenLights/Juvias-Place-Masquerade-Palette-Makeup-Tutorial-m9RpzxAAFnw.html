tutorial on this look I know it's really
similar to looks I've done in the past
but it was really really requested to do
a look using the warmer colors in the
masquerade palette by a Jew vias place
which is this palette my last tutorial
where I featured this I used the blues
and I had so many requests to use the
more purpley reddish tones in the
palette so that is what I did today
the only thing extra is I added just a
little bit of glitter
but yeah I really love this look these
are my favorite looks to wear in the
fall we are officially in the fall not
that it's ever fall in Miami but you
know I love red cranberry warm smokey
eyes and if you want to see how to get
these look then just keep watching okay
so before I get started with the eyes
I'm just going to prime my eyelid so the
eyeshadows can apply better and they're
more pigmented so of course I'm using my
enigma primer potion and then I'm going
to go in with the masquerade palette by
Julius place I'm going to take the
lightest Brown in the palette it's
called Burkina I believe I'm gonna
butcher these names I'm sorry but I'm
just taking that on a fluffy crease
brush and I am just putting this all
over my crease like everywhere
everywhere and then I'm going to take
the shade aida add up and on a flat
brush I'm just going to apply this to my
entire lid it's just going to act as a
base for this shadow that I'm going to
put it then I'm going to put down next
this is the shade Calabar and I can't
help but think of Halloweentown
Calabar is revenge oh my god
Halloweentown I love that movie anyway
so I'm just applying this to my entire
lid as well and then I'm going to take
the heavy metal glitter eyeliners by
Urban Decay this one is called Midnight
Cowboy it's kind of like the gold silver
and I'm applying this to my entire lid
as well and then I'm going to sandwich
the eyeshadow right on top so I'm going
to take Calabar again the same shadow
and I'm applying it right on top this
really does emphasize the shadow you're
putting on top and you get the little
glitters kind of peeking through without
being like too intensely glittery does
that make sense yes I love that little
trick then I'm going to take the shade
Zulu
and I'm going to use this shadow to
blend Calabar into that crease shade so
just so that it fades out into like a
gradient effect and I'm just going to go
back and forth between the crease shade
I put down originally and that Zulu
shade making sure everything is nice and
blended and then I'm going to take this
products from Sephora it's their beauty
amplifier lid and liner primer it's
pretty much just like a very light
eyeshadow close to my skin tone so I'm
using that to apply underneath my brow
bone but then I went in with the shade
géza and I just applied very little bit
of that underneath my brow bone so it
wasn't like too intense to line my eyes
I'm going to use the Inglot gel liner in
number 77 just do whatever line you want
to do thick thin you know do you I know
that liquid liner is really really hard
to do at least it is for me so I can
never really do it on camera very well
but I'm going to go in with my NYX
pleasure Lee eyeliner in black and
tightline and then I'm going to move on
to my face this is the cover FX
illuminating primer and honestly my skin
texture is so bad that I shouldn't have
used an illuminating primer that was my
fault it kind of made my skin look a
little bit bumpy cuz it highlighted my
horrible texture but anyway I went in
with the Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation and then I'm going in with
the collection lasting perfection
ultimate concealer and this is in the
shade fair I believe yes I am blending
it in with the Ofra sponge just like
their new beauty sponge and I have to be
honest it's not my favorite it's a
little bit too squishy for me but I'm
just going to use it that concealer to
not only hide my dark circles but to
highlight those parts of my face as well
and then I'm going to set that concealer
using my NYC smooth skin it's a very
messy powder but it is the smooth skin
loose translucent powder and I'm just
using that on my Real Techniques setting
brush setting underneath my eyes or
anywhere else I applied the concealer
okay so let's finish up the eyes I don't
know why I'm pulling at my eyes I never
pull at my waterline so weird to see
this but I'm using that same eyeliner I
used earlier and I'm just using that on
my waterline and then I'm going to take
the shade zobo and this is a really
pretty like vibrant purple I'm running
that on my lower lot on my low
lashline and then I'm going to take the
shade bori and I'm going to do the same
thing only like on a more precise pencil
brush this pencil brush releases next
month I believe and it is amazing so
excited for that then I'm going to jump
right back into the shade Aida and I'm
going to do the exact same thing just
run that underneath my lower lash line I
kind of like how these three colors
combined and then from my inner corners
I'm going to take that Giza shade and
it's so beautiful I love this shade and
I'm going to pop that on my inner
corners and for mascara I'm using the
Kiko extra sculpt volume mascara on my
top and bottom lashes but I wanted a
little bit of something so I applied
these Ardell 110 falsies now to finish
up my face makeup I'm going to take
these two makeup geek contour powders I
mix the shades warm porcelain and cool
porcelain just because I feel like the
cool porcelain
is too cool and then the warm porcelain
is too warm so I like mixing the two and
that is what I use to contour but for
blush I'm going in with the Becca
cosmetics wild honey blush it's a
beautiful peach and then I'm going to
pop on my highlight this is the dose of
colors highlight in the shade peach glow
it is a little bit too glittery for my
liking but it does give you exactly that
like a beautiful peach glow for lips I
wanted something warm and nude so I'm
taking the Kylie cosmetics liquid
lipstick and exposed but then I wanted
something a little bit lighter on top so
I took the NYX Browns
lipstick in the shade go I couldn't find
this in store so I bought mine on Amazon
but it just lightened up the lip a bit
beyond that completes this look I hope
you guys enjoyed it thank you so much

next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
