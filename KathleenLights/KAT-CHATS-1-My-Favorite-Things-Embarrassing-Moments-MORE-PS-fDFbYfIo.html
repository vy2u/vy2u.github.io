that my phone cracked I'm reading John
Mayer's tweets hey guys so today's video
is going to be my Q&amp;amp;A video and I am
calling this cat chats and I want to
make it a thing I want to do like Q&amp;amp;A
videos every so often like every few
months I don't know and I want to name
it something cool like cat chats so yeah
this is Ken chats number uno so I asked
you guys on Twitter and on Instagram to
ask me questions because I was doing a
Q&amp;amp;A video soon and if you don't follow
me on Instagram or Twitter
you absolutely should make sure to
follow me on one of those social media
sites so next time I do a Q&amp;amp;A video I
get your question I have a feeling that
this video is going to be too long
because I did get a lot of questions
from you guys so I'm going to do this in
two parts this is cat chats part one and
then part two will go up up part two
will go up tomorrow so yeah I'm actually
using my ring light in this video today
because it is six o'clock at night and I
have a feeling that this video is going
to be long so the Sun will go away by
the time that I'm done I'm sure so if I
look a little weird that's why I still
don't know how to control this thing oh
also before I get into the questions
ignore my makeup I look I have glitter
all over my face I was just sitting here
bored and playing around with some
makeup and then I thought oh I should do
my Q&amp;amp;A video so I look like a hot mess
like my face I'm like sweating so I'm
just gonna randomly pick the questions
from Twitter and Instagram and let's get
sorted how old are you people ask me
this question every day on my channel
and I answer it a bunch of times but I'm
gonna answer it again I am 22 years old
people love to tell me I'm 12
or that I look 12 but I'm not someone
actually literally told me you look 12
to 13 that's why I do really feel like
I'm out of focus this light is throwing
me off when I watch your videos I hear
it's like accent are you Hispanic
see I know gorg loss silly me
yes I am Hispanic my parents were both
born in Cuba I was born in the United
States but when you have Cuban parents
and you live in Miami you tend to have
an accent where are you from originally
Mississippi or Miami was born and raised
in Miami the only reason why I live in
Mississippi currently is because Danny's
in the Navy so this is where he is
stationed but we're actually moving in
less than a year back to Florida because
he's getting stationed in Florida I'm
not going back to Miami but I'm going
back to Florida even though I really
really like Mississippi dude what made
you start YouTube
I've actually been watching YouTube
videos since high school my best friend
Amelia used to sit in her bed and watch
video after video after video after
video and I would always be like what
are you watching and she introduced me
to the YouTube community and it's like
addicting I was just on YouTube all the
time and when me and Danny got married
he was like you watch a lot of YouTube
and I was so obsessed with like beauty
products and hair products and makeup
and stuff and he kind of pushed me to
make a YouTube channel so I think Danny
for this everyday what were you doing
before YouTube and what would you be
doing now if you weren't a youtuber it
wasn't really doing anything honestly
that sounds really bad but Danny and I
got married and then I moved to
Mississippi and I kind of like dropped
my whole life to come to Mississippi so
I was just here and kind of in a funk
with my life like Danny was doing
something really good with his life the
military and I felt like I was doing
nothing like I was just in a rut in my
life so honestly before YouTube I kind
of felt lost or I didn't really know
what what I was supposed to be doing in
my life you know what I mean I didn't
really have anything to call my own so
now I do and I'm just a better person I
think I'm a happier person that I was
before YouTube and what would I be doing
if I wasn't a youtuber probably the same
thing I was doing before at like a
regular job by the way I will
answering all of the Danny related
questions in the part 2 of cat chats I
had a lot of questions about Danny so
I'm just gonna tackle all that in one
video and that will be tomorrow's with
you what would be some advice you'd give
a new youtuber I get this question a lot
and I feel like the only advice I can
give someone is to be genuine and just
be yourself I know it sounds really
cliche everybody says happy yourself
no but seriously be yourself and don't
be afraid to show your personality like
I'm a little bit odd and I'm a little
bit strange and my sarcasm and my weird
faces and the way I talk kind of like
throws people off or turns people off
but I don't care I sit in front of the
camera and I make faces and I don't care
no that's who I am that's my personality
and I feel like people will appreciate
who you are more if you show your
personality no matter what kind of
personality you have so that's just my
advice for yourself bring your
personality to the camera and be genuine
just be honest like I think that's all
people want to see is honesty like you
know lighting in a good camera and a
good background that comes second the
most important thing is you it's within
well you do a meet and greet
anytime soon I was gonna do a meet and
greet while I was in Miami but there was
a change in planned with Danny's flight
coming back from deployment and I had to
leave Miami a lot sooner than I thought
I was gonna leave so that's an end of
happening but I might I might this is a
huge might it might have a meeting rate
in Miami in September but that's a night
how do you like where you're currently
living I kind of answer this question
semi I like Mississippi I know people
are like but you're from Miami Miami
it's Miami's nice but I like Mississippi
I like the calmness the tranquility and
I like being on my own and you know
seeing something different I've lived in
Miami for 18 years so it's nice it's
nice to not be with the same people you
grew up with in the same buildings you
see every day and the same thing it's
nice to have a change in pace even
though I'm terrified of change and
absolutely hate change
it's nice you know I'm actually so
accustomed in Mississippi that I don't
want to leave
I don't want to leave how did you think
of the name Cornelius I used to be
really really obsessed with the movie
Thumbelina and the prince in the movie
is Cornelius he is Prince Cornelius and
he is the Prince of the fairies and he's
beautiful and I love him I love
Cornelius so that is where I got the
name from a lot of people think I got it
from Planet of the Apes but I've never
seen that movie but I hear that the main
ape is Cornelius but no from Thumbelina
what's your most embarrassing moment I
have answered this and like two videos I
think I've said it before my entire
middle school career was an embarrassing
moment like one big embarrassing moment
which is why I went to a different high
school than I was supposed to I mean I
mainly went to a different high school
because my cousin went to that one and I
wanted to be with my cousin but I did
not like my middle school experience at
all I really felt like the girls in my
middle school were like like very six
chicks 13 going on 30 reference I had
really embarrassing moments um let's see
I got spit on um from the second floor
like somebody was in the second floor
and I was in the first floor and they
spit on me Oh some girl was like running
across like the portable area like
running and she like body slammed the
crap out of me and I like did a backflip
on the floor and everybody like stopped
to laugh actually body slammed me I fell
on the floor my legs in the air and only
one person helped me up I mean all I
needed was one person help me up but
everybody else was nothing but I guess
just to answer your question what is
your most embarrassing moment I would
have to say middle school funniest thing
Cornelius has done um this isn't the
funniest thing Cornelius has done but
it's the funniest thing I do to
Cornelius I hide underneath my desk I
haven't done it in this house because my
setup is different but when I lived in
the other apartment I used to hide
underneath my desk and call carnies into
the room
qur'anic I could have sworn she called
me actually I have a clip of that in my
phone so I will insert that right now
ronita is come here do you sing what is
your favorite song
I do not saying I wish I saying which
sucks because my dad sings plays guitar
please piano like very musician II and
so was my brother he's a musician as
well and he's an artist too like he
paints and like I have no talent I got I
got nothing good and my favorite song is
boys of summer by Don Henley that has
been my favorite song for years if
you've never heard the song listen to it
I get really good feelings good vibes
from that song what was your dream job
when you were a teenager um it would
probably be an author it's still my
dream job to publish a book I love
writing it's my hobby I love it so much
that's probably like my dream job it
still is like if I could publish a book
I would cry every day there's my life
from happiness what is the one thing you
like about yourself and the one thing
you don't like about yourself I like
that I'm a good person and I don't care
if that sounds like conceited or not but
I know I'm a good person you know I
never have any malicious thoughts
against anyone in my head and like
sometimes I see people and I hear
certain things that people say and I'm
like how could anybody say that like I
know deep down I'm a good person I was
raised very I was raised to be a good
person so
and and one thing I and one thing I
don't like about myself I don't like
that I'm so paranoid like I have like
serious paranoia like that you know what
that's a whole nother video that is a
whole nother video name something that
you're really insecure about I am
actually very insecure about my profile
not my profile I have a good side and I
have a bad side like not many people
know this not a lot of people know us at
all but whenever I take a picture I take
it like this this side I take a picture
always I always show this side of my
face because I have like a lazy eye like
something happens to this side of my
face when I smile and I don't know what
it is I don't know what it is and
everybody's like no that's not true
whenever I say that but you could tell
like immensely in photos and I'm gonna
show you right now don't judge me don't
judge the side of my face but it is not
attractive like I don't know some people
look the exact same no matter which way
they pose but holy crap I could tell a
huge difference and I do not like this
said my face at all so that is my
biggest insecurity is whenever somebody
you know sneakily catches the photo of
me on this I what is your favorite food
um Mexican Mexican food academics me
food everyday or Honduran food those are
my top two favorite foods I have
answered this question before I feel
like but I love Honduran and Mexican
food they are a may seeing what is your
number one thing on your bucket list
it's going to Paris I have dreaming I
have been dreaming about Paris since I
was like born who is your favorite
youtuber I absolutely love Nicole
Guerrero she's one of my faves for sure
because I feel the Miami just bursting
out of her I know she lives in Florida
but I feel like a Miami connection I
just feel it I feel it
well I like I feel like I relate her and
Jeremy her boyfriend reminds me a lot of
Danny so I know I like her favorite
drugstore makeup brand it would have to
be Maybelline I feel like I have a lot
of Maybelline stuff there fit me line is
like my absolutely favorite thing at the
drugstore I just I real
like my bling favorite movie my favorite
movie is someone like you it's cheesy
and it's like in the 90s and I don't
know but that movie speaks to me like it
really does I like it because it's so
true and like the obstacle that the main
character goes through I just it's so
true I think any girl any girl who has
like gone through a breakup or anything
like that should definitely watch
someone like you because it hits home
it's a good movie favorite actor and
actress my favorite actress I don't
really have a favorite hrus I love
Ashley Judd who is the main character
and someone like you she's also the main
character in um double jeopardy which is
another favorite movie of mine so I
really like Ashley Judd but it's not
like oh my god but my favorite actor in
the whole world is Gary Sinise hands
down I think he's freaking amazing and
loved him you could just tell he's a
good person he's like supporter of the
troops I love him if I could meet
anybody in the world just Gary Sinise
like I need to meet him what are your
favorite TV shows my favorite TV show
has always been friends it's been my
favorite show for years like since I was
younger I have all the seasons my best
friend in middle school bought me the
entire series of friends I have it in
like this big red box it's amazing um so
I've seen I've seen every single episode
of Friends like over 30 times every
single episode I could um recite like
80% of the episodes like word for word
like verbatim like what the character
will say next it's intense but besides
friend I really love the office so much
and I think that people who love the
office are good people like if you don't
like the office I don't know I don't
know
by the way definitely check out the
Mindy project if you like the office
it's not the same but it's amazing I
think the Mindy project is super
underrated watch it have you read Fifty
Shades of Grey um I feel like people are
gonna hate me for this but I don't like
Fifty Shades of Grey
I thought it was poorly written I read
like half of the first book and I
couldn't I couldn't I was like what am I
reading this is ridiculous this is dumb
so I'm sorry if I offend anyone I'm
still gonna watch the movie
of course but I didn't like the book
what do you miss most about Miami um
besides the peeps the fam and stuff
definitely funk kumite and platinum a
little and Cuban bread definitely Cuban
bread I'm CUBAN bread absolutely if you
end up doing it
YouTube professionally what do you hope
to accomplish I'd love to come out with
my own lipstick line like I don't even
care about a makeup line that would be
amazing but lipsticks like I would love
more if I could publish a book that'd be
great
but it wouldn't be a beauty book oh you
could live anyplace in the world where
would you live Montana I saw this I saw
this movement I was younger called a
river runs through it it's with Brad
Pitt he's very young in the movie it's a
fish it's about fishing and the movie is
set in Montana and I remember like
staring at that movie like there is
something about Montana that oh my god
I've never been there but I want to go
so bad I wouldn't I probably wouldn't
live there
I would probably love to live in
Southport North Carolina if you are from
Southport North Carolina god bless you
Oh that place looks beautiful I've never
been there either but I would love to
live there if you could marry any
fictional character from a movie who
would it be definitely from a movie from
a movie from a show Jim Halpert from
that wasn't a question but whatever I'm
another another from a movie Matt flam
half from 13 going on 30
perfect man or Jesse from pitch perfect
because he likes The Breakfast Club
funny sorry a group of my friends in
high school like my best friends in high
school we all ate lunch in a classroom
and we call ourselves the breakfast club
even though we eat lunch but diet a use
for your hair I get this question all
the time actually use the joy Co Capac

subscribers a big a compliment
accomplishment read correctly did you
ever think you would get this far you
have helped and inspired so many of us
um Cornelius is licking my toes right
now and yes of course 100,000
subscribers is insane to me insane I
never thought I would ever get that many
I remember telling my friend Gabby like
I feel like I have accomplished a main
goal if I ever get to 100,000
subscribers I feel like I have made it
like in myself so it's so crazy I
remember when I had 15 subscribers and I
had 15 subscribers for like four days in
a row and I remember Denny was like I
just want that number to move and it's
crazy and now I have almost 200,000 and
I'm like one mac lipstick ever Ruby whoo
hands down I don't care how drying it
feels on the lips it's my favorite
lipstick in the world what do you do for
a living I get this question all the
time because Danni is constantly moving
because he's in the Navy and we're like
back and forth so many places I can't
keep a job for so long like I did before
he went on deployment I worked on base I
worked at the next and that was my job
but then he deployed and I had to quit
my job and then I went to Miami and I
wasn't gonna get another job to just
quit in six months so right now I'm
doing YouTube and I'm doing this this is
my hobby and stuff and yeah I just I
can't keep a job we move too much
sweeter salty popcorn Oh salty popcorn

love like potato chips and french fries
and cheese and nachos and all that stuff
I really eat that thin like a brownie or
cake or Oreos how do you keep healthy
I'm not healthy Danny and I are
actually like on this health kick um
we're trying to like have a better
lifestyle we do cheat if you follow our
vlog Channel we're eating all the time
but we do cheat like on Fridays and
Sundays because we go out to eat on
those days but we're actually doing
really really good we haven't had soda
in a long time
we're trying to eat healthier and we've
been working out everyday so I want to
be healthy like on the inside I want to
feel good and when I eat healthy I feel
good the food is just so good I love
food I'm really the type of person that
really enjoys to eat I love food so it's
hard for me but I'm eating better but I
still treat myself to that Buffalo Wild
Wings every Friday because you only live
once
will you do YouTube forever cuz I love
you Thank You Morgan fartface 20 that is
her name and I like it I would love to
do YouTube forever what would you tell
your 16 year old self when I was 16 I
thought that everybody was a decently
good person I thought that everyone was
really nice and genuine and you know and
I didn't know how mean people could be
and I and I was a major I still kind of
am but I was a major pushover in high
school I just I felt like I had no
backbone in high school like at all like
people could be mean you could probably
throw a bologna sandwich at my face and
I'd be like I'm sorry and pick it up and
give it back to you I'm being dramatic
but I was a major pushover so if I would
I would like slap my 16 year old stuff
and be like girl get it together
advice on boy drama don't worry about
boy drama don't worry about boys
seriously don't worry about boys guys in
high school is so dumb I know that
sounds really mean cuz there are a few
like I had a really good friends in high
school they were genuinely good guys
like really nice really good guys um I
know a lot of them actually there are
really good people but the majority of
them like you're so dumb and I don't
mean dumb like literally dumb like
immature like guys take longer to mature
and you know just tough what are some of
your favorite books if you like to read
I love to read and I definitely
recommend love monkey if you are into
romantic comedies it's more like an
adult Ishq there's no like weird Fifty
Shades of Grey things happening in that
book but it's like a humor for like a
dolt I feel but it's a love story as
well if you are into like the y.a novels
I recommend and on the French kiss oh my
god that's my favorite book besides love
monkey and then the French kiss is
amazing I love anything from Nicholas
Sparks but those are like boring books
and I love Nicholas Sparks but it's true
it's like a boring read like a soft
romantic read like in the bathtub kind
of book but definitely I'm in the French
kiss if you ever read that book and you
can read it it would change your life I
promise and dubbed the Fault in Our
Stars cuz John Green hello okay so I'm
