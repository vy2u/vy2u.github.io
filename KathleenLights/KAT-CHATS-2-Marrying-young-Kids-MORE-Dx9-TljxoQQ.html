Danny looks like a dad comments let's go
away blow it away blow it away move away
move hey guys so welcome to part 2 of
cat chats this is part 2 of my Q&amp;amp;A video
I told you guys on Twitter and Instagram
that I would be doing a Q&amp;amp;A video and a
bunch of you guys asked me a bunch of
questions if you don't follow me on
Twitter or Instagram you should links
down below and if you didn't see part 1
of this video I will link that down
below as well so you can see part 1
basically I knew that the video was
going to be way too long because there
were so many questions so I decided to
break it up into two parts and I had
tons of questions like the majority of
the questions were about Danny so I
decided to do part two strictly to the
Danny related questions you know I just
wanted to say thank you really quickly
because I got so much nice feedback in
the other Q&amp;amp;A video like part 1 of this
video I just want to say thank you so
much because I really appreciate every
nice thing that you guys tell me I
really really appreciate it and it was
crazy how many of you guys feel me on
the whole profile thing so glad I'm not
alone by the way I got a few comments
telling me that I should do these cat
chat videos like once a month I'm gonna
do them like every few months but if you
guys want me to do cat chat related
videos often let me know because I got a
question and one of my recent videos to
do a video on my anxiety and how I deal
with anxiety so if you want to see that
let me know and then I will do a cat
chats video on that and I'll kind of
make this like a series where I talk
about personal things on my channel
often and they'll be my cat chat videos
so let me know if you like that idea
down below but anyway enough rambling
let's get on to the questions how did
you end Danny meet my best friend Amelia
who have spoken about a couple times on
my channel I've just mentioned her a few
times she's been my best friend since
sixth grade I met her the first year of
middle school and Danny is her older
stepbrother
her father and Danny's mom married each
other when they were already born so
they became step brother and sister but
cheek refers to him as her brother and
he refers to her as his sister because
they pretty much grew up to
oh that is how I met Danny he was the
older brother of my best friend and I
was like in love with Danny since the
moment I saw him there's something about
like an older brother of your friend
that's just I feel like I feel like a
lot of people feel that way aren't you
always like ooh your older brother is
here so yeah at that time at Danny he
was Amelia's older stepbrother so I've
known him since I was about 13 years old
what is the age difference between you
and Danny or seven years apart well
seven years in a few months
dining was seven years old when I was
born and I get a lot of comments a lot
of comments love beautiful comments
telling me that Danny looks like my
father I get them a lot and it really
really bothers me I don't care about
hate comments like people can comment
whatever they want and I don't care it
really rolls off my back like oh you
have pretty ears and um again you talk
so much like comments like that don't
bother me but when it happen I get
comments saying that Daniel is with my
dad it irks me so bad like it gets under
my skin
badly and if a seven year old had a
child then yeah maybe Danny could be my
father
if seven year olds were having kids in
the world then sure yeah absolutely of
course but I personally don't think he
looks like my dad nobody in my family
none of my friends thinks that he looks
like my daddy ously you know it
shouldn't matter what people comment but
it really really annoys me I mean it
doesn't help that people think I look 12
years old I think that has a lot to do
with it
I don't think that Danny so much looks
older I think it's the fact that I look
so young you know cuz I am 22 years old
but people think I'm like 16 I think
that's a pretty big factor in that I
guess I understand I mean people are
entitled to their own opinions and
whatever but it's not like a crazy age
difference at least in my eyes I really
don't see it as a big deal and besides
Danny plays his xbox all day and he's
we're always goofing around and laughing
and making fun of each other like we're
a bunch of kids I don't see him as like
an older guy personally I mean whatever
people are going to say whatever they
want so that
just that bit to back how did Danny
propose he went out to dinner he like
took me to dinner to in a really really
nice restaurant in Miami like really
really pretty like dim lighting very
romantic and then we went out to the
beach and it was nighttime and it was
actually freezing on the beach which is
weird
it was Miami and um he got down on one
knee and said like the nicest thing he
gave me like a little speech and it was
so so sweet he was actually really
really nervous like you couldn't even
finish a sentence I felt bad for him it
was like saying all these nice things
but you could tell he was like shaking
in his voice it was really sweet I loved
it cuz it was just it was funny but it
was cute long have you been married well
well actually got married two months
before my 19th birthday I got married
November 22nd 2010 and my birthday is
January 27th so I got married two months
before my 19th birthday so I was 18
years old when I got married pretty much
19 but still and I know that's like
super shocking to everyone and oh my god
that's way too young to get married oh
my god oh my god yes yes I know I know
but I was in a point in my life where it
honestly happened at the perfect perfect
time I was going through so many things
at that point in my life like when me
and Danny were getting really really
serious and stuff I was I was going
through a lot in my life like really
really crappy crappy crappy situations
saying that's why I got married that's
obviously not why I got married but it
was like Danny saved me in a way and
just took me away from all of my
negativity and it was amazing it was
amazing I remember I was sitting in a
car with him when we were just dating
and he was like when I come back from
Afghanistan I'm gonna ask you to marry
me and I was like okay dude yeah sure
and he was like no seriously and I was
like yeah okay
sure he was like no for real and he was
serious and I didn't believe him because
we weren't dating for that long
before we got married we were together
for about like a year before we got
married which is crazy I know but when
you know you know okay when you know you
know and I've known Danny for a really
really long time so it's not like I
married a stranger you know I've known
him I've known his family for a long
time
so and I may be shocking to a lot of
people but it just worked it worked and
now I have been married for almost four
years in November we make four years of
being married so it's nice I got a lot a
lot a lot of questions about children if
I see any children in my future any
bundles of joys coming yeah I definitely
see kids in my future hopefully like God
willing you know everything goes
smoothly and I'm able to have children
and everything is you know God willing
but just not anytime soon I mean I'm
only 22 years old I'm pretty young I'm
not saying that being a young mom is bad
because you know gone which bad self of
your young mom that's nice but I'm still
not in the point in my life where I feel
like I can take care of someone like I
worry so much about Cornelius like on a
daily basis that I cannot picture having
to worry like that about a baby it's
tough I mean I see my sister and her two
kids and you know the struggles and the
obstacles that she goes through as a
mother and I don't think I'm ready for
that I don't think I'm ready for that
just yet and I know what I know that
everyone says you're never ready for
kids like you're never truly ready and I
believe that 100% but I want to be semi
ready and right now I really want to
focus on YouTube I kind of want to see
where my life takes me if YouTube will
take me anywhere maybe in the future I
want to see where I'm going with my life
before you know Danny and I make a
little family or anything and I want to
travel I really do not saying you can't
travel with kids you absolutely can but
I want to go to Paris and I want to go I
want to travel the United States and I
want to go across the globe you know I
don't be able to do all those things
before I have children of course I would
want to travel with my kids too so they
can experience that
but I just want to be stable in my mind
and in my heart you know like okay I'm
ready it's time I think I could do the
whole kid thing now I have a really good
childhood growing up like when I was a
lot younger we went to Disney once a
year you know my dad worked really
really really really hard to maintain us
my mom never worked I had to stay at
home mom you know she did everything for
me I had a really good childhood and my
dad worked so hard for that and I want
to be able to give my kids you know the
kind of childhood I had I just think
that that's fair I want to be able to
give them not spoil them but give them
what they want you want to go on
vacation next week let's go on vacation
next week so yeah I definitely see kids
in my future just not my super super
near future if it happens before then I
will accept it with arms wide open but
is right now not right now how do you
deal with Danny's deployments um I just
do you you just have to deal with them
that's that's the only thing I can say I
have been married for almost four years
and Danny has deployed four times he's
been to Afghanistan we weren't married
when he was in Afghanistan but we were
dating so he's been into Afghanistan
Africa Guam and Spain so since we've
been together
he's been on four deployments the first
time he deployed we had just gotten
married we got married November he
deployed in December and he deployed for
eight months instead of six which is the
other times he's deployed for six months
but that first time after we got married
he was deployed for eight months and it
was like a traumatizing experience but
every time Danny deploys I do go back to
Miami to spend time with my family
because if not I would go absolutely
crazy by myself not saying I can't do it
by myself but at least I have the
support of you know my dad my sister my
mom you know my best friends I have the
support there in Miami with me I can
tell you is if you are a military spouse
and your husband is about to go and
deployment for the first time surround
yourself with positive people really
really good positive people that is a
major point seriously when you say when
you surround yourself with really really
positive influences you you just feel
more positive and you just you feel a
lot better
but I did I kind of cut ties with people
who were weighing me down or friends
that were wearing me down and I
surrounded myself with really really
good loving amazing friends has helped
so much more the deployments went so
much faster and that's all I can tell
you is surround yourself with good buds
is there anything Danny does that annoys
you Danny loves to wake me up for
absolutely no reason no reason at all
that is like my major thing and I wish I
wasn't like that because I turn into a
coral Deville when I'm asleep and
somebody wakes me up I'm like flake
fleam is coming out of my ears and like
my nose and stuff I hate to be woken up
and Danny wakes me up all the time for
no reason
just to wake me up and it annoys me so
bad someone asked where was your first
date with Danny we actually went to a
really great restaurant we like to eat
it was in the Hard Rock in Miami the
restaurant is called tattoo I believe I
believe yes and it was amazing I don't
even remember what I ate it was over
four years ago I mean we've only been
there that one time but my food was so
incredibly good and the end of the
dinner they gave us like little tattoos
like little fake tattoos and I still had
them to this day I kept them I have like
a memory box that I keep all my memories
of Danny and and I still have those
little tattoos that they gave us we put
one on each other that night and then I
kept the other two that they gave us so
I don't know it was a really really good
first date it was a really good
restaurant do you like being a military
spouse I really do I really really do a
lot of people from different countries
think that the American military is like
terrible terrible terrible which it's
not something I'm going to get into
because I don't want to start you know
issues on on this channel or on these
comments it's um what I'm trying to do
but I support the men and women that
fight for this country I support them
100% because if it wasn't for them I
can't imagine what this country would
look like and they don't sacrifice their
lives for themselves they sacrifice
their lives for the people living in
this kind
three so I do love being a military
spouse I think it's an honor really I do
because I'm so proud of Danny and what
he does where is Danny from Danny is
actually from Miami as well his parents
are both Cuban just like my parents are
both Cuban we were born and raised in
the same place and the majority of Miami
is full of Hispanics so yeah he speaks
Spanish
just like I do can you show us pictures
of your wedding how was your wedding
like I have a lot of questions about my
wedding and I didn't I didn't have a
wedding I know that sounds bad but let
me explain a time the Danny and I got
married we didn't have money to afford a
wedding and since he lived in
Mississippi and I lived in Miami didn't
care how we got married or anything like
that we just wanted to be together
already because the distance was driving
us both crazy so we didn't have a
wedding I did take pictures we did take
like engagement pictures and I'm
actually and we're actually thinking
about renting like a wedding dress and a
tuxedo and taking my professional
pictures so that I could have some
pictures of me and a wedding dress but
at the time we just we really couldn't
and we're thinking of having like on our
five year anniversary like when we've
been together for five years of having a
wedding of like renewing our vows and
having like a small little celebration
type of thing just to renew our vows and
stuff to have a memory of some kind of
wedding you know what I mean honestly it
doesn't bother me I know that's a big
big big deal for a lot of people is like
oh my god you didn't have a wedding
that's crazy but I didn't want a nice
wedding I wanted a nice marriage so that
was more important to me not the wedding
but the marriage so I mean so far so
good
what is your wing order of Buffalo Wild
Wings Danny and I go to Buffalo Wild
Wings every Friday and we order the
exact same thing every Friday we get
fried pickles and we get honey barbecue
boneless wings and fries and that's so
bad for you but we've been drinking a
lot more water and we've been working
out
how'd your family react to you getting
married so young surprisingly my family
reacted pretty well surprisingly I mean
to my face they reacted well they were
probably like oh my god when I wasn't
around
- sprung this on my parents like hey
Billy I'm getting married and my parents
were going through a divorce at that
time so it was a little bit weird it was
a little bit off but my dad was just
like whatever makes you happy you know
he was very very supportive because
which is shocking because I had like the
world's most hey uh do you think all
zodiac astrology stuff is accurate no I
don't because according to the zodiac
signs I'm an Aquarius
oh it just slapped myself pretty hard
there and I am nothing like my son
absolutely nothing like I read about
aquarius's and I'm like what
no like I have nothing like an Aquarius
which is really odd and whatever I met
anyway according to the zodiac sign like
a Taurus which is what Danny is his his
birthday is May 2nd a Taurus and
Aquarius are like the world's worst
match Oh going back to how my family
reacted okay I'm going off course here
they they kind of understood and they
accepted it my mom is obsessed with
Danny and my sister loves Danny and it
all turned out good and my friends tell
me all the time like my friend Stephanie
is always telling me she's like I cannot
picture you with anybody else okay guys
so I'm gonna wrap this video up right
here it's probably long as well thank
you guys so much for asking all these
questions if your question did not get
answered in this video or the one I
posted yesterday don't worry there'll be
more cat chats segments well if you guys
would like oh I'm still broken
yeah so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
