not I can't sit down Celine
can you move hey guys so today's video
is another cat chats video but unlike
most of my cat chats this one is a
little bit more serious for those of you
who wanted to see an awkward boy stories
part two that is going to be the next
cat chats video I film I still haven't
done much with my background I want to
put lights up here like I told you guys
in my other catch-up video but I
struggled because it's a long story but
I'm gonna try to make this little
section cute PS I don't like how they
cut Porter's hair not at all so I've
been wanting to do this video for a
while now I keep going back and forth
and I've been telling you guys for a
while now that I was gonna do like an
updated anxiety video how I've been
dealing with it because I feel like my
anxiety has gotten pretty bad over the
past few months but every time I clicked
record like every time I sat here to
record the video I never went through
with it I never finished recording it
because I found that there was no
solution in the video like I wasn't
being helpful at all and the only reason
I want to do these videos is to be
helpful in some way but recently I feel
like I have i've just had kind of like
an epiphany or like a revelation and I'm
finally ready to sit down and talk about
this I'm gonna link my old anxiety video
down below because I go into details
about kind of like how I got anxiety I
talk about my parents divorce and my
dad's motorcycle accident which pretty
much triggered kind of like all the
anxiety I had once that happened so I'm
gonna link my old anxiety video down
below but honestly recently my anxiety
has been triggered by fear when I told
you guys that I felt like my anxiety had
really gotten worse the past few months
I didn't know why I didn't know what it
was and I finally came to the conclusion
that it's it's fear it's my fear of
everything and I'm not trying to say
that as a joke I'm always joking around
like oh no cuz I'm just scared of
everything but I am and it's not normal
and I know that it's not normal and um I
feel like okay this video is going to be
all over the places I'm just going to
spew out words but if you are someone
like me if you're watching this video
and you are just
like me in the sense that fear triggers
so much of you anxiety I hope this video
helps you in some way
recently I have gotten so many
opportunities that I'm so incredibly
grateful for I'm so grateful and I was I
was not able to do 90% of them like most
people I have a huge fear of flying I'm
talking about like a huge huge enormous
fear of flying I need to take Dramamine
on every flight I literally like have
panic attacks before flights I am so
scared to fly it's mostly any kind of
public transportation as odd as that
sounds I'm afraid of goobers I'm afraid
of like elevators I'm afraid to get in a
car period I'm just I don't like it and
it doesn't sit well with me and I don't
really understand why but that's just
kind of Who I am
especially flying I think that's like my
biggest transportation fear that's also
done and doing what I do for a living
like doing the whole YouTube thing and
having as many subscribers as I do I I
get these amazing opportunities like I
said that I'm still grateful for and I
don't want to I don't want to sound like
I'm trying to show off in any way when I
begin to talk about this like I'm not
trying to say like oh look at me I have
so many opportunities and yeah I turned
so many down that's not what I'm trying
to do I'm just trying to show you guys
like the extent of my feet like how
ridiculous it is but I was invited to go
to Turks and Caicos with Tarte and I
turned it down because of my fear of
flying
even though Turks and Caicos is not a
long flight from Miami I don't think so
but I said no I turned down Hawaii
with benefit I turned down New York with
Marc Jacobs and I even turned down Dubai
I had an opportunity to go to Dubai and
hang out with bethany mota which is
incredible because I love bethany mota
so much and i remember getting the email
and i really could not believe it that i
had an opportunity to go to dubai
somewhere that's so beautiful and I
remember sitting down and searching like
the flight distance
and freaking out and I said no I was
like I can't do it I'm not going and
then I remember like bethany mota
posting pictures of her in dubai and her
view was incra
and these photos she was posting were so
incredible and I just remember feeling
like I just remember thinking like
what were you so scared about Bethenny
made it perfectly safe and she's having
a great time and what were you so scared
about and I didn't know I didn't have an
answer I mean I know why I'm scared of
planes but why did I let that stop me I
don't know have you ever spoken to
somebody and you tell them like I have
really bad anxiety or you start talking
about certain things like that and
someone tells you like oh but that's
just in your mind just that's in your
mind forget about it and you look at
them like wow thank you all my all my
problems have been solved - thank you -
not how it works
it's not how it works your mind is so
powerful your thoughts are your reality
I cannot stress how true that is and the
more afraid I told myself I was the more
afraid I was I don't know if that makes
sense like the more I talked about how
bad my anxiety was and oh my gosh I have
so much anxiety and it's still terrible
the more anxiety I had it's almost like
I was telling myself I had bad anxiety
so I created it and it was just getting
worse and worse and worse because I just
kept telling myself it was getting worse
and worse and worse it wasn't until I
went to San Francisco where I realized
that I had a moment so I went to
generation Beauty was it like a month
ago it's been like a month and a half
and I remember I stayed there for seven
days and I cried every single day for
like the first four days when I got
there like my plane landed in California
thank God I was so excited I was so
happy that my plane landed and when I
got into my rental car or whatever I
just started sobbing my anxiety was
through the roof and I didn't understand
why I was ready off of the plane and I
just didn't want to be there I did not
want to be in Los Angeles I wanted to be
home with my dogs ever since I got
Porter and Celine my separation anxiety
with my dogs has been 20 times worse
because I've had Cornelius for he's
about to be eight years old so I had one
dog and whenever I had to travel you
know I had someone just had to take care
of one dog now it's three dogs it's not
that easy to just pick up and go when I
have three dogs so while I was in LA I
like could
not stop thinking about Porter and I
know that's like only Porter not the
other dogs
Porter is attached to me by the hip in a
very very very very terrible way like he
cannot do anything if I'm not in the
room he cannot eat unless I'm watching
him eat he cannot he can't leave me
alone for five seconds it's like a crazy
attachment I've never had any dog
attached to me like that in my life
so every time I feel like so every time
I leave I feel like I'm betraying him in
a sense and I know that sounds
ridiculous but I could not stop thinking
about it I just I just wanted to be home
so bad and then that plus the thought of
me getting on a plane again it was just
driving me nuts the only day that I felt
good was generation Beauty were those
two days because I was meeting so many
subscribers and they were just getting
my mind off of the war going on in my
head so when I came back from Jen video
I was like I am done traveling for
months I don't care who who asks me to
go I don't care I'm done I'm gonna stay
in my house and I'm not gonna go
anywhere for the next five months at
least
and then this opportunity presented
itself and it was benefit and they asked
me to go out to San Francisco and to do
a photo shoot which I will tell you guys
why did that photo shoot later on I
can't really tell you guys why now but
anyway so this opportunity presented
itself to me and you know Danny was like
we've never been to San Francisco love
to do it let's go and I was like I don't
want to get on another six hour plane
ride I don't want to do it so I kept
telling myself like no I'm not going to
San Francisco I'm not gonna go I'm not
gonna go and Danny kept reminding me
like you are going to regret this if you
don't go he always backs me up when I
don't want to take a plane ride but he
was just like this is a great
opportunity you were so going to regret
it so I laid in bed that night and I was
like fine I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go
but I'm only gonna go three days I'm
just gonna go do what I have to do and
leave so that's what I did and I
remember getting to San Francisco and
standing in front of the Golden Gate
Bridge mind you I don't travel I don't
go anywhere I've never seen much of the
world so when I stood in front of the
Golden Gate Bridge I almost cried like
I'm literally about to cry now it's so
stupid but it was so pretty that it made
me feel so dumb for turning down so many
things that could have been amazing
is for me and I just felt so grateful in
that moment that I was there and I was
experiencing this with Manny and Patrick
and Danny and the girls from benefit
that are so amazing and I felt so good
and happy in that moment that I really
just realized what am I so scared of and
I've come to realize that what helps me
is telling myself what's gonna happen is
going to happen whether you are afraid
or not and if you're watching this and
if you're like me tell yourself that
this has really really helped me after
going to San Francisco and I came back
and looking at the pictures that we took
for benefit I'm so proud of myself and I
didn't do anything like life-changing
but getting on that plane a month after
I just got off a plane I would have
never done that if you're someone like
me who you feel you're flying and you
let your fear get in the way of doing
great things don't because your fear is
not gonna stop the world from turning I
like to tell myself that our lives are
set in stone whether that's the case or
not that's what I like to tell myself so
I could either get on plane or get in a
car or do whatever it is it makes me so
scared and do it anyway because your
destiny has already set you know you are
living the life you are supposed to live
we are all put on a certain path for a
reason now whether you live it to its
fullest potential is completely up to
you I feel like I've dug myself into a
hole
little by little you know I found a job
where I don't have to get in my car and
drive to work every single day so my
fear of driving just started to get
bigger and bigger and bigger because I
didn't have to get in the car every day
when I used to work at the next I used
to get up every morning and go to work
and drive my car and I had to I was
forced to drive my car but now that I'm
not forced to drive my car I don't find
myself getting in my car I'm still
working on that I'm still trying my best
I try to tell myself it's gonna be ok
and if it's not then you're gonna worry
about it in that moment but right now
it's going to be ok my mind revolves
around what ifs oh but what if this
happens
what if open what if this happens oh I
can't do that because what if what if
this happens oh my gosh and I just I
can't do it anymore I can't sometimes
the biggest issues people have are in
their minds they can live these perfect
lives but struggle daily on the inside
and recently I just feel like I'm just
so scared of everything for no reason
when I shouldn't be because what's meant
to happen is gonna happen no matter what
I kind of wanted to make this video to
tell some of you that you're not alone
if you fear so many things and if your
fear holds you back from so many things
you're not alone I'm the same way but
I'm here to help you I'm here to be
afraid with you you know it's okay to be
afraid as long as you set a goal and you
try to help yourself I felt like for a
while I wasn't helping myself I kept
telling myself like no you can't do that
because you're scared remember you have
this fear remember I was like my own
worst enemy still kind of am I'm not
gonna lie but I feel like I've gotten a
little better I started doing things um
that I knew was gonna be helpful to me
and maybe these tips can kind of help
you I bought this on Amazon um a few
days ago this is the my bucket list
journal it says write it down memories
are all that's left like it goes up to
number 100 and you're supposed to list
100 things you want to do in your life
I've only written to down which number
one I see the Eiffel Tower number two is
go to Ireland on the following page you
know it tells you it has a date it says
what I did why it's on my list
where who was i with the details how I
was feeling and my goal is to do this
why not try to live the life you're
given to the best of its abilities like
and it's not just about fear it's about
who you are as a person try to be a
better person every day try to work on
yourself this is the only life you have
guys this is the only life you have and
another thing that has helped me I know
it seems really dumb but like
inspirational quotes throw them all over
your house if you have a beauty room or
if you have your own your bedroom put up
things on the wall that make you happy
that make you feel good because if you
constantly have happy thoughts those bad
ones that like to creep up on us they
won't come in you won't let them in I
printed this picture out I got it
I see I printed it and then I bought
this frame on Amazon it says the best
things in life are the people you love
the places you've been and the memories
you've made along the way and I thought
it was so fitting in my situation
because I have to tell myself this every
day don't want to live your life with
what-ifs and I found that recently
that's all I would do is I'll but what
if this goes wrong what if this goes
wrong what if this goes wrong and it's
like well what if it doesn't what if
this goes right put yourself in the
light from now on Bry your best and I
know it's really hard when someone tells
you to do something but try your best to
look at things glass half-full don't be
afraid to live your life the best way
you can live it don't let your fear stop
you I'm telling you that because I know
because I let my fear stop me every day
right now I'm on the journey to success
I'm on the journey to positivity I'm on
the journey to light and where no fear
I'm on the journey to a place where
there is no fear I'm on my way and I
hope you guys are on your way with me I
hope if you are someone who suffers with
the same things that I do I hope that
this video helps you even a little bit I
hope it encourages you to I don't know
buy a bucket-list journal or print out a
bunch of happy quotes and happy thoughts
and put them all over your walls
eliminate bad people in your life even
though you may not think that that
triggers - any fears it might
you never know just I hope this video
helps you and to try to become a better
you I try every day to become a better
me who knows how I'll feel in three
weeks but until I get there I'm not
gonna worry about it oh that completes
this video I guess I don't know if this
was all over the place some of you might
comment like this video was all over the
place but that's okay I'm all over the
place all the time
I just wanted to talk about it I just
wanted to tell you guys my moment in San
Francisco and even if you don't care I
hope some of you do even if this video
reaches and touches one person I've done
my job love you guys so so much and just
know
I'm with you through your struggles
through your anxiety through your pain
that goes on in your mind that nobody
knows about I know and I'm with you and
