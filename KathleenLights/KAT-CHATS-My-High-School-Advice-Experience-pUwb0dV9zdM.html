cat chats into I cut myself and the
band-aid just fell off welcome to
another episode of cat chats today I
will be answering some of your questions
that you asked me a long time ago I
asked you guys to ask me questions like
about my high school experience or any
advice you want because I know a lot of
you guys are in high school right now
okay so let's go ahead and get started
on these questions did you do any sports
in high school no i 100% did no sports
in high school because I suck I love
sports like I love watching sports well
that's a very broad I like watching
basketball and baseball those are the
only sports I like but I was just never
into sports myself I'm really not
coordinated guys how did you make time
for homework
and friends honestly um this is the
advice that I can give you if you have
homework do it the second you walk
through the door when you're home I mean
there were times where I waited to like
10 o'clock at night the day before it
something was due I'm a huge
procrastinator until this day I take
forever to do things I'm supposed to do
but my advice honestly if you're
watching this in your high school do
your homework the second you walk in
through the door I know that that's the
last thing you want to do because you
were just in school doing a bunch of
work but there's no better feeling than
getting home and doing your homework and
as soon as you're finished you're like
oh my gosh I have the rest of the day to
watch Netflix and for friends honestly I
didn't have like a huge group of friends
I had like my small little circle and I
saw them Porter get off the table
and I used to eat lunch with them every
single day so I mean I got to see my
friends all the time at school so what
do you do when no one lets you sit with
them and you're always alone and this is
a really good question if you have
someone who doesn't let you sit with him
f then don't sit with him I wouldn't
want to sit with someone who doesn't
want me there I always say this but if I
knew then what I know now I feel like
high school would have gone completely
different from me and I don't regret it
I don't regret the decisions I made and
the people I was friends with but I used
to put so much time and effort into
people who didn't put time and effort
into me and I was worried about
everything I was worried about it
what anybody thought about me would
anybody I just a word too much about
other people when you shouldn't take
lunch in a classroom with my friends
like my actual close friends um and I
eat lunch in a classroom I all the cool
kids were eating lunch in like the new
building we call it the new building
even though it's probably been sitting
there since like the 80s but all the
cool kids we're getting lunch in the new
building and screw them so to answer
your question don't worry about those
people who don't let you sit with them
they're bitches and I don't like to
curse in my videos but who does that who
doesn't let someone sit with them that's
so effed up but just do your own thing
girl trust me because when you graduate
high school those people are going to be
extremely irrelevant which year of high
school did you enjoy the most and why
this is a hard one because I really
really really enjoyed my senior year of
high school but if you guys watch my cat
chat video you know Janine my cousin she
was a great above me so when I was
senior she was already graduated so I
kind of like there was a void missing in
my life cuz Janine wasn't there but my
junior year of high school was the worst
year ever the worst so I'm gonna say I'm
just gonna say my senior year even
though Janine wasn't there I had a lot
of fun I feel like I already knew who I
was I didn't let anybody get to me or
like opinions get to me I was very
confident my senior year and who I was
as a person so yes I had fun my senior
year what was your best high school
experience that's a really hard one
because I was very very dim I was really
to myself I didn't go to pep rallies I
didn't do anything the first year that I
went to homecoming was my senior year
because I didn't want to go my freshman
year or my sophomore year or my junior
year I can't I really can't answer that
wow that's really sad
that's really sad someone says high
school boyfriend's past experiences any
advice okay I had a rule I had a rule in
high school and I thought I fell down
this is a long story if I ended up
wanting to date someone I wanted to date
them when they if they went to a
different high school only because if
you guys in high school you guys know
that who you're dating
everybody's dating them too because
everybody is in your business and if you
break up the drama the rumors it's
really really like aggravating so I did
have one boy
for an in my high school and I was a
freshman so I was a baby and nobody
really cared about me and it was kind of
like my first real boyfriend and I had
no idea how vicious people can be in
high school
his name was William that's not a fake
name that's actually his real name which
I don't mind saying because I don't I
don't hate him so he was actually really
awesome so William and I dated my
freshman year of high school and then we
broke up I can't remember why I was hot
Robo and Tom go I don't remember why we
woke up but he was really really awesome
and really nice so I never had a bad
experience with William in high school I
don't think maybe he has a different
opinion but I don't but then when we
broke up I felt like everyone knew we
broke up and I kind of we kind of
avoided each other in the hallways like
hmm like super awkward and I didn't want
to feel like that ever again
so I didn't like to date boy which I
didn't really date boys if you guys know
my dad is crazy and didn't let me go
anywhere let me do anything he's not
crazy very overprotective I understand
him so I didn't really date guys I only
had one other boyfriend in high school
and he didn't go to my school so did you
ever fail at class yes I did actually
fail the class my freshman year thanks
to Samantha if you guys seen my previous
cat chats I told you all about mr. vials
he was my math teacher my freshman year
and in my defense he was the world's
worst math teacher like he didn't teach
like he sounded like the Visine guy I've
said this before he sounded like the
Visine commercial guy and he would talk
like that and it was really hard to even
learn anything in that class
Samantha failed it - we both got these
so I had to make it up at night school
because that was literally the world's
worst class name one embarrassing thing
that happened to you in high school
oh god list isms in high school not that
many in middle school I had a lot of
embarrassing moments a lot
I was actually this you didn't ask this
but I was actually trampled on in heist
in middle school I'm not even kidding
there were a bunch of people running I
hope I always got knocked over like I
always got pushed accidentally people
always ran into me like I was invisible
it happened all the time but a bunch of
people were running down the hallway one
time in middle school like a ton of
people and I was drinking water and I
guess they didn't see me
and I was trampled like I was on the
floor trampled by these people
I was also spit on somebody spit on me
from the second floor in middle school
fun times in high school embarrassing
embarrassing embarrassing oh yeah
something really embarrassing happened
to me but it happened outside of high
school I mean I was in high school but I
it wasn't in school so I guess that
doesn't count
jaian don't even want to talk about cuz
that opens a dark dark dark door
I don't know I'm probably forgetting a
lot of things I like to block a lot of
bad memories um I did actually really
really really really really really like
some guy when I was a sophomore junior I
can't remember but I really liked him a
lot and he was playing my ass
hard color and all his friends knew
about it and no one told me anything but
I mean the people who didn't tell me
anything were mostly girls like girls
who he knew and I was kind of friends
with didn't tell me like hey he's
playing us he don't like you gir no one
told me so that was really embarrassing
that whole experience with that guy was
so embarrassing
what was your freshman year like I loved
my freshman year to be honest I mean I
had a really awkward breakup my freshman
year so that part I didn't really like I
was just so happy to be out of the
middle my middle school that I felt like
I was a brand-new person I actually
wasn't supposed to go to the high school
that I went to I was supposed to go to a
different one middle school was so
horrible for me and I didn't like
anybody I went to my middle school ways
like I know this sounds crazy I had my
close friends Emilia Stephanie I had my
friends there were like a vicious group
of girls in my middle school and I there
were so mean they were so mean one time
one of them told me in fourth grade that
I looked like a dinosaur and I've never
forgotten it like I've never forgotten
it that same girl told me in fifth grade
that I was a loner and like a loser and
pathetic and all that time that I was
always by myself and I was like a loser
or whatever so I really hated middle
school and I just wanted to get away
from that group of people because I
don't know if it's like this everywhere
but I went to elementary school with the
same people and then I went to middle
school with the same people because you
go to school depending on where you live
so everyone in like
diction go so that seems that makes
sense I don't know if it's like that
everywhere just the United States but I
did not want to go to the same high
school as these people I was like
there's no way I'm going there I wanted
to go to Janine's high school and at
that time I was dating Williams so I
wanted to go to the same high school he
went to and Jenny was going to that same
high school and it was the best decision
I have ever made I don't regret it I met
amazing people in that high school and I
don't know I feel like my life would be
totally different if I would have gone
to the other high school so I'm just I'm
very grateful that I went to the high
school I did go to so with that being
said my freshman year was awesome I was
meeting all these new people because I
didn't know anyone I just knew Janine
and Janine's friends so I would eat
lunch with you know like the sophomores
I was a freshman I was just meeting
people all the time and it was awesome
and then I mean it got a little dark
when I started to know people they know
down the line but overall my freshman
years old tell a story about your
favorite teacher I have two favorite
teachers well okay so in middle school I
had my favorite teacher in the whole
world her name was Miss panetta at Miss
Pineda I don't know why I said it like
that
and we would call her Miss P and she was
awesome I loved her she was my seventh
grade teacher and then in eighth grade I
became her teacher aide for one of my
one of my classes I was her teacher aide
and I was so depressed because I was
leaving her and then one day randomly
I'm like standing in my school I'm a
sophomore and I see her walking in my
school and I'm like Miss P and she's
like oh my god because she thought I was
going to the other high school the one I
was supposed to go to and she's like oh
my god what are you doing and I was like
I come to this high school what are you
doing she's like I teach here now so it
was awesome and then I became her
teacher rate I think for my junior year
and my senior year so she's kind of like
my mr. Feeny she's my favorite teacher
she's the teacher I would eat lunch with
every day we all ate in a classroom all
my friends we decided to move our little
party to miss peas class and I loved her
but I had a teacher my freshman year
that I swear changed my life his name
was mr. Osorio he was a wrestling coach
but he was my I want to say government
or history American history teacher I'm
not sure tour remember
it was my freshman year and I remember
looking at like my schedule the first
day of school people were like oh my god
mr. Sorrell he's the worst everybody
hates him he's the devil and I was like
oh my god great and I loved him I
thought he was the best the best he was
very very blunt and people didn't really
like that he just told you how it was
like he told it like it was you know but
he was awesome he would like walk on the
tables he was really really cool I feel
like in that year I learned so much
about who I was because of him I know
that sounds really weird but he used to
tell me all the time like you're gonna
be a good you're a good one you're a
good girl like I could tell you're one
of the good ones and I was like thank
you I don't worry good one and then he
actually left he left his teach at
another school I was so sad because he
was awesome but everybody hated him I
loved him I thought he was funny so the
next question is did you have any
bullies and I didn't personally have
bullies I take bullying very very
seriously and I think it's like a really
big issue that everybody deals with like
I hate bullies that is my number one
thing I hate bullies and I had girls
that were pretty mean to me I had no
backbone at all in high school like I
just let people walk all over me and I
guess it was I was an easy target so I
mean in their defense it was really easy
to be a biatch to me and for me not to
do anything back maybe if I was a little
bit tougher if I had a little bit more
of a stronger personality they wouldn't
have messed with me and for some reason
people are very vicious in high school
like I used to see fights on a daily
basis like physical fights and I never
ever ever understood that in my life
don't put your hands on another person
like it used to make me cringe in school
want to get into a verbal fight fine
like you want to hash things out call me
whatever call me names you want me or
whatever just don't put your hands on
someone else this sounds really stupid
and really like goody two-shoes but you
don't know the damage you can do to
someone you don't know how you can hurt
someone like it's just wrong do not get
into physical altercations with anyone
and this is the advice I can give you I
know I'm going off-topic but if you're
in high school and you're having
problems with there's a freaking rooster
outside
my window can you see him
um side note I have a huge fear of large
birds oh my gosh oh my God look at this
one you won't be able to see it right
here just like a family why do so many
roosters outside my window what that
like I was taking if you're in school
and you're having problems with a girl
or you're a guy having problems with a
guy or having problems with someone
don't fight them don't fight them I mean
unless they're like pounding you into
the ground and you can defend yourself
yeah defend yourself hash things out
with words
just try your best to contain your anger
don't put your hands on someone else
unless they punch you in the face then I
mean you have every right to punch them
back you are having issues in high
school these people that are giving you
issues these bullies these people who
are attacking you like they're nobodies
okay they must be really sad and
miserable with their lives to make you
feel bad but you will graduate high
school and you will never look back okay
you will never see these people again
everyone thinks that you're gonna know
all of these people like when you're in
high school you think oh my god I'm
gonna know everyone for the rest of my
life we're all gonna be friends raw
whatever you're gonna know your enemies
forever that that's not true you leave
high school and you stay with your small
group of friends that's it your circle
gets smaller as you get older and you
become more wise and you realize that
true friendships come one in a lifetime
and everybody you're friends with now in
high school you may not continue to be
friends with them when you graduate and
that's okay so the same goes with
bullies like once I know it's tough but
hang in there once you graduate high
school you can just like and never look
back
did you go to prom yes I did I went with
Danny and actually Danny forced me to go
to prom I'm gonna insert my prom picture
I was one of those people like oh I
don't do prom prom for the cool kids I
don't want to go to prom so Danny was
like you're gonna regret it for the rest
of your life if you don't go to prom
it's a very big thing for people go to
prom so he forced me to go and I went
with him and I gotta be honest I not I'm
not happy I went I could have got I
could have done with
I'm going and I'm pretty sure I would
never go to it but I went because he
really wanted us to go I guess how do
you deal with social anxiety um I didn't
I like I said I ate lunch in a classroom
which I mean in high school that's a lot
of people would tell me like that's
weird why do you eat lunch with a
teacher like that's weird but that's
just how I dealt with things I stayed
with my little group of friends in one
room cuz okay I gotta be honest I didn't
really get really bad anxiety until 2011
and I graduated in 2010 so I did have
social anxiety while I was in high
school now I have generalized anxiety
but social anxiety happened to me in
high school but only if I was like at a
party I didn't want to be at if I felt
super uncomfortable like in a classroom
and there were people there that made me
uncomfortable like things like that gave
me social anxiety but it was mainly if I
was forced to go to a party I didn't
want to go to and I was just like oh my
god I want to go home how do you deal
with nerve-wracking presentations oh I
have the worst I'm so nervous I don't
like to be under the spotlight which is
why I started doing YouTube because I
just sit in a room and I talk to so many
people but I there's nobody here and I
don't like to be the center of attention
I don't like people looking at me I
don't like it so sometimes I would like
beg my teacher please please please
don't make me present please can I
present to just you by ourselves in
lunch like I have asked multiple
teachers to let me present certain
projects when nobody was around like out
after school or during lunch and some of
them actually said yes some of them were
biatches but some actually said yes um
so I guess try to do that if you are
someone who like sweats profusely and
you're just nugget or presentations
maybe sit down and talk to your teacher
maybe they'll understand somebody asked
how to avoid fuckboys um there's no way
avoiding them guys high school is full
of them okay so that completes video I
know this video is so incredibly long
I'm so sorry and I hope that I feel like
it didn't even give advice in this video
I was just talking out of my arse but I
hope that you got some sort of advice
or learn something or this video was
helpful I hope this video was helpful in
some way so yes thank you guys so much
for watching
please subscribe if you have it already
