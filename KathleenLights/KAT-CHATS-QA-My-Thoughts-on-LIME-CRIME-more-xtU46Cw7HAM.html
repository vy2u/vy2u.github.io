cat chats I am NOT in my usual cat chats
corner because that doesn't exist
anymore
since I'm working on this new room I
just recently moved I'm sure you guys
know that but I just recently moved that
I'm working on this new room I have to
create a cat chat corner once I put my
lights up which by the way right before
I sat down to film this video of UPS guy
came with my lights so excited so this
cat chats is not like a super funny one
or one based on a topic like they
usually are but today is another Q&amp;amp;A
video actually promised this video like
so a week ago or maybe more I was
supposed to film it earlier last week
but with all the painting I've been
doing I just didn't get around to it oh
and a lot of you guys have been asking
me where my boxycharm video is and
that's the video I'm gonna film right
after this I kind of took a break from
painting and I decided to sit down and
film so I'm gonna film that right after
this so my next video will be in this
same ensemble and I've also done a lot
of questions if I unsubscribe from Ipsy
and no I didn't I'm just dumb and I
never change my address on the Ipsy
website but I changed my address and
hopefully my Ipsy bags will be here and
ready so next month I will continue the
Ipsy bag unboxings as well also another
thing before I get into the video a lot
of people have been telling me like hey
it's not you know it's not fair you said
you were gonna post every single day
once you got back and I guess I wasn't
clear when I said that I will be posting
a video every single day for a whole
week once I'm settled once I'm done
painting and like once I know that I can
film every single day that's what I'm
gonna do and I'm gonna be posting a lot
of videos I will make up for lost time I
promise you that just once I get like
settled and everything is like my own
yeah I just want to make that clear so
anyway let's get on to today
you a if some of you are wondering what
queueing I didn't know you were doing QA
actually asks you guys to ask me
questions on Instagram and Twitter so if
you don't follow me on Instagram or
Twitter you did was you that was
definitely if you didn't get that
I will leave my Instagram my Twitter
down below ah
how many Sakai Liverpool what is your
favorite and least favorite friends
episode I thought that this question was
so funny by the way I'm not like saying
the names of people who asked because I
can butcher names and I don't want to do
it my favorite friends EPS whatever is
definitely the one in Barbados the one
where they're in Barbados where Monica's
hair is like this big and Mike proposes
and the ping-pong match I think it's
like part two because they have like two
whole episodes where they're in Barbados
and I think the second one is my
favorite but it is definitely my
favorite episode I cry laughing watching
that episode it's the best and I don't
think there is a crappy friends episode
I think every single one I've seen is
good but my least favorite probably any
of the episodes where Emily is in the
show Emily Ross's like wife one of
Ross's wipes I despised Emily's so much
so those episodes just make me so mad
that I hate watching them what is your
favorite song right now well right now
right now right now I'm not exactly sure
I usually just have like a favorite song
I listen to it all the time which you
guys whoa some of you guys know my
favorite song of all time
is boys of summer but actually I just
found out that Selena Gomez came out
with her new song with Zedd I don't know
if that's how you say his name Zedd and
I love the video and I love the song and
I have been playing it on repeat for
like the last two days I'm obsessed with
this song I don't
I like it but I love it
have you ever been to Ireland and if not
do you plan on going I've never been to
Ireland I haven't been anywhere admit
our cruise and that went a couple of
places and then I went to Atlantis in
the Bahamas so I've been to like beachy
areas but besides California
I like having gone anywhere you guys
really know that my all-time dream is to
go to Paris I just want to go to Paris I
want to go France so bad I don't know
why but it's always been something that
I always wanted to do and hopefully I
get to do it but I've also a big dream
of - to go to Ireland my top three
places are Ireland Paris and Alaska I
know it's super strange or random but I
really want to go to Alaska as well but
something about Ireland calls my name -
I don't know if it's like all the green
if Ireland is beautiful and I'm
definitely jealous of anybody who lives
there favorite foundation of all time
definitely make a Forever HD it's my
go-to for like pictures and fancy stuff
what is your favorite and least favorite
part about looking younger than you are
this is actually a funny question
because everybody thinks I'm 13 um that
is probably the number one comment I get
on my youtube channel like you're
married aren't you five all the time
everybody thinks I'm 15 which is not
offensive to me at all like if that's
not your fault you thought I was younger
like I mean it's it's a common mistake
but definitely my least favorite thing
about looking younger than than I am is
like people think of a child
everywhere I go I've said this story
before but I'm not even joking like two
years ago I went to Outback and someone
asked me if I wanted a kiddie menu and
crayons I'm not even joking but my
favorite part would be that I look
younger than I am I think that most
women want to look younger so that's
always good and hopefully when I'm older
I still look younger than what I am
would you rather have one single boob or
four boobs like others I would
really rather have one single boob there
are many they're a very strong amazing
courageous women who only have one boob
because of cancer whatnot and they're
still just amazing and beautiful young
women with no boobs so I definitely
would rather have one boob then for do
you plan on doing meet-and-greets in the
future I'm not exactly sure I'm not even
sure I have always wanted to do a
meet-and-greet
especially in Miami Mike and Gaby have
always talked about it but I just kind
of chickened out always at last minute
something about like crowds and stuff
like that just really gives me anxiety
and I'm super afraid of people
I don't know I'm afraid of people but
yeah maybe a meet-and-greet in the
future once I put my big girl panties on
what was it like being recognized in
person for the first time and does it
happen that often it doesn't happen that
often at all I'm not a celebrity or
anything but the first time I'm pretty
sure I was at Sephora and someone was
like hey I watch your videos and I love
them my hair was in a bun and my clothes
and pretty sure like all like put Jamie
looking and I looked a hot mess and I
was like no oh god no go look at me but
it was super cool the girl was really
really nice and it was fun but now it
doesn't it doesn't happen that often if
you could only use two makeup products
what would you use mascara and concealer
no concealer and my eyebrows I don't
know
do you like Justin Bieber no I am so
sorry I'm so sorry for anybody I'm
offending any believers I don't this I
don't dislike him I just I just don't
love Justin Bieber what are your
thoughts on the lime crime scandal okay
so I wanted to get it into that in this
video really quickly
probably not quickly but I wanted to
talk about a little bit in this video
because I get questions every single day
about it like what do you think about
the lime in Carl I'm feeling Quinn creme
creme skin and honestly okay this is how
I see it
a lot of people like Lime Crime is under
a huge like attack recently and a lot of
people are starting to see lab crimes
true colors I should say and it's all
because of the security breach that
happened you know lime crimes website
got hacked and a bunch of people's
information was stolen like credit card
information including myself I lost $600
from purchasing on their line prime
website and I lost $600 thankfully I got
on the phone immediately with my bank I
have a great Bank I got in the phone and
they were able I had to fill out a form
I was like the longest process ever but
they were able to give me my 600 people
lost thousands of dollars on the on this
security breach thing that happened
thousands of dollars and it sucks but
honestly I think that that could happen
to any company I feel like any website
any company could have a security breach
like that can have a hack happen to them
now don't get me wrong I don't think
that Lime Crime did it in a very
professional manner I feel like they
didn't really advise people that this
was going on they kind of let it like
you know like they threw the dust under
the rug until it blew up I got a letter
at my house
stating like hey this is what happened
sorry like three weeks after they even
took the money out of my account so I
don't think they I don't think they were
smart about it I don't think they were
very nice about it but I don't blame
them for being hacked because it can
happen to anyone
it's the shadiness that's been going on
way before I personally don't support
Lime Crime anymore I had a bunch of it
if you guys go it's super dark but if
you guys saw my makeup collection I have
a ton of velvetine those are the only
things I own from Lancome and they're
amazing which really sucks that there's
kind of a shady company because they're
a really good product but recently a lot
of people have been saying that their
velvety n--'s
are like not the same as they used to be
and then actually one of those people
that can tell you that that's true
because I got a Velveteen and it was
super watery and not the same and I was
really disappointed but anyway I want
you guys to Google this it's not about
this hacky it's not about the security
page
you guys to go on tumblr especially and
Google Lime Crime scandal I'm crime
there's like a whole blogger that talks
about all the issues the owner of the
company and certain things that the
company has done that isn't right for
example I have read that the owner of
Lime Crime has actually tried to sue
bloggers or bloggers for saying negative
things about the company I have read
that you know they used to back in the
day so products that really weren't
theirs and just put the line prime label
on top of it you know I have heard a lot
of things but I don't exactly know if
that's a hundred percent true because
you never really know like people can
invent that the owner said something
that she probably didn't say you know
you just never really know my dad always
used to tell me when I was younger um
believe nothing of what you read and
only half of what you see and for some
reason that has stuck with me for years
because it's so true
oh hello person riding bike so I'm not
exactly sure if all this is 100% true
but it's enough for me to put up my red
flag and say okay no too many weird
things and too many sketchy things have
happened with that company for me to sit
here and waste my good hard-earned money
on them and I won't anymore
and also I feel like this security
breach was a huge Karma to them because
now is when people are starting to
Google them and look into them a lot
more and seeing like all is like crazy
crap that lime crime that's happening
with them and I did post a recent video
about my lime crime velvetine lip
swatches that was before I found out all
this stuff about lime crime so the only
reason why I still keep that video up is
because there's a lot of good
information in the comments a lot of
people are like no you know don't
support this company this business and I
want people to read those comments and
be like informed so absolutely that's
the reason why I keep that video up it
sucks because I love my velvet teens but
I will be repurchasing anything from
life crime ever again like I said do
your research and google it now it might
not be
100% true but you know some of the stuff
I honestly do believe those are my
thoughts on it to me it's not about the
hacking and I don't really want to dwell
on it too much because you know we're
all humans at the end of the day and I
don't want to sit here and like attack a
company those are my thoughts I don't
support them I will buy from them
anymore you won't see Lime Crime on my
channel anymore I'm sorry that's just
how I feel and I'm a big believer in
sending up for what you feel so that's
that that was the super long answer but
you know just a heads up guys there's a
bunch of questions that you guys asked
that I have answered in a previous cat
chats like a Q&amp;amp;A video a lot of them
about like me wanting kids and Danny and
stuff like that so I will link in my
previous Q&amp;amp;A videos down below if your
question was about that it's probably
answered in that video what is your
favorite book and why I have mentioned
this before but love monkey by Kyle
Smith is my favorite book I really also
love Anna and the French kiss but I love
monkey beats that a little bit it's just
a funny witty romantic kind of book and
I really love it because it's like smart
- I love it
have you ever been to Cuba and do you
still have family there if not would you
like to go I've never been to Cuba but I
do have family there my aunt lives there
my dad's sister with her kids and my
mom's side of the family but we we lived
it like I have a ton of family in Cuba
I've just never been and I would love to
go but actually don't think that I can
because Danny's military nice like sure
all that works would you ever make
videos in Spanish okay I get this
question asked so much on my channel and
I never answer it because I never know
what to say but no I won't be making
videos in Spanish on my channel because
I'm so uncomfortable with the way that I
speak Spanish like y'all like paniolo
but I don't like how I speak Spanish
like sometimes I get my words mixed up
and like I get stuck it's just a little
bit embarrassing for me to speak Spanish
because I get super tongue-tied so a
video in Spanish
is just not a good idea do you wish his
date or are you glad you moved
I love Mississippi you know it's super
weird coming from me I'm from Miami and
you would think like party in this video
yeah but I love Mississippi it's very
laid-back and it's very common that's
what I like Miami is too much too fast
too much for someone like me I'm glad
I'm closer to home and I'm glad that
Danny and I get to see loved ones more
but I love Mississippi darky update how
are they any cute stories I don't really
have any cute stories my dogs are good I
have three dogs and a lot of you guys
have asked me like where's Cornelius
like you're constantly posting bitching
about Selena Porter and like Cornelius
is like nowhere to be found
and that's true Courtney's just hates
taking pictures these days my favorite
dog I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna lie
I'm not gonna like corny this is my
favorite he's my dog of six years he's
my best friend he's my favorite I can't
help but say that but Porter and Selene
are still puppies and they're in that
stage where they love to play and they
love to like hang out so Selena Porter
like BFFs and they're always with me
running around and stuff and Cornelius
likes to go to the room and sleep all
day
like that's favorite thing to do is
sleep so that's why he's like never in
pictures because he's always sleeping
under a pillow nice and comfy in the
room he doesn't want to be bothered with
the hooligans and the rest of the house
what was your first kiss like my first
kiss was so awkward I think that
everybody's first kiss is super awkward
um but I cut it was awkward but I was
kind of nice it was with my friend
George who at the time was my boyfriend
but till this day I consider George a
friend of mine even though I don't
really talk
ten that much anymore but I love George
he's a great person I'm glad that my
first kiss was with someone who is like
a really good genuine person that I
stayed friends with years after that I
was 14 when I had my first kiss and it
was actually on the couch of my best
friend's house and we were and it was
super weird he was like okay I'm gonna
kiss you now and I was like okay it was
so cool year because he knew how like
scared and freaked out I was he was like
okay it's gonna happen
right are you ready I was like okay I'm
ready it wasn't like Oh cute like oh my
little like popped out and the stars
were shining it wasn't like that
if you could go back in time and relive
any moment of your life which one would
you choose probably the day that Danny
proposed I had so much fun that night he
went to a super nice restaurant and then
we went to the beach and it was just so
fun and Danny I don't know I had a
really good time once an inside joke you
and Danny have I guess this isn't an
inside joke but when we speak we
replaced our seas with teas I mean I
shouldn't tell the story it's so strange
like instead of because we say because
I'm like no because you know I don't
know if it's so weird
never mind it doesn't make any sense but
whenever always say it word with see
like Kate we say Kate
like I want to be state so weird I think
so
