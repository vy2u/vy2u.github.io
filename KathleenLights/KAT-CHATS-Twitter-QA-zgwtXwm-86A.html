cat chats is my lighting weird in this
video I feel like my lighting is very
weird because I usually film my cat
chats videos at nighttime and like the
Sun is beaming here but then like my
light I'm really I can't see myself
so today's cat chat isn't like a
traditional cat chats or one that I have
promised to do which those are coming
but it is a Q&amp;amp;A video I wanted to do a
Q&amp;amp;A specifically for my Twitter pop
Twitter photos multiple follow wills if
you don't follow me on Twitter make sure
you do I asked you guys on Twitter to
ask me questions because I was going to
do a Q&amp;amp;A and I wanted it to be just my
Twitter peeps so next time I will do
just my Instagram peeps or both or
whatever it's gonna be really random I'm
just gonna jump into these questions I
am freezing for some reason the AC in
this house today won't warm up I don't
know what's going on but it is cold and
I can't control the a/c Savannah Moore
asks what is your favorite episode or
moment and friends I've answered this
question a bunch of times I always get
friends questions when I do Q&amp;amp;A so you
guys know my friend's obsession you guys
are good my favorite episode ever is
when they go to Barbados and Monica's
hair is like humongous I love that
episode when Monica and Mike are playing
ping-pong it is literally my favorite
moment of friends it's so good and like
Phoebe and Chandler like talking in the
back it's so my favorite for sure
Darla's Forbes asks do you plan on
eventually making your own line of
cosmetics I don't know maybe if that's
in the cards for me if it's something
you know it may be who knows I don't
know it's not something I'm working on
it's not something I'm gonna be working
on anytime soon but if that's in the
cards for me then I would definitely
love to do that Umbra Whitesides asks if
you could be in any TV show as any
character you wanted what show would it
be in which character would you be okay
is this question like if I'm that
character what I have all that
characters problems and I like all of
those characters struggles that they go
through in that show I don't know I
don't know I would probably want to be
Mindy Lahiri from the Mindy project
Liz asks can you juggle oranges while
singing the front
theme song I can't even juggle oranges
without singing anything so no Ashlyn I
hope I'm saying that right Ashlyn what
is your favorite thing to do outside of
makeup and YouTube ah for sure writing I
love writing I have like a passion if I
could be an author that would be amazing
so definitely writing I enjoy it
storytelling I love it lissa says what's
the best advice you've ever gotten the
best advice I've ever gotten is super
super super cliche I know but my dad
always used to tell me when I was
younger is do unto others what you would
have done to you in other words you
wouldn't be an asshole to yourself you
wouldn't be mean to yourself so don't do
that to other people don't be mean don't
be an asshole to other people and it's
very cliche but it's so true just gonna
have to stop yourself and be like wow
you know should I be saying these things
should I be doing these things and
that's the best advice I've ever gotten
toxic Riedel asks favorite TV show at
the moment for sure The Walking Dead
that like at the moment the show this on
TV right now
um is The Walking Dead I love it it's so
much I'm not gonna say people's names
from now on because I am afraid to
butcher everyone's names and I hate
disrespecting people by saying their
names wrong so let's just move forward
someone asks why are you team Jake over
team Fitz who's actually funny I was
talking about it on snapchat and then I
was tweeting all about it I am team Jake
/ team Fitz and I know that the majority
of people are team fitts like he's he's
the guy you want Olivia with because
it's forbidden romance yeah I totally
understand that but I but I just really
love the underdog and you know that when
this show completely comes full circle
and this show completely ends that she's
gonna end up with Fitz it's just that's
just what what's gonna happen and I I
love Jake I just like Jake as a person
Fitz kind of creeps me out guys Fitz
kind of creeps me out
they both have done things that I do not
agree with but Fitz has done more things
that I do not agree with the number one
thing being okay spoiler alert
fast-forward this video like 30 seconds
or a minute
fast for this video a minute if you have
not seen the whole show but he has been
cheating on Mellie for like the longest
time with Olivia which whatever cuz him
and Mellie don't get along anyway so
it's not like he is lying to Mellie
Mellie knows but then Mellie goes and
sleeps with this Andrew guy and he gets
really upset at her like he gets so mad
and
treats Olivia bad on that in depa so
door whatever and it's like dude dude
dude you sleep with another woman why
are you upset and I don't like that he's
always like this if you could have one
television series come to life which
would it be of course France for sure I
would love to be there friends if I
could be like the other person in that
group would be great there's one food
that makes you happy I love avocados and
you guys know that if you follow me on
Twitter or snapchat I love avocados I
have a van I have an avocado every
single day every single day I cannot
live without it and it's funny because I
used to make fun of my grandpa when I
was younger so much because he ate an
avocado with every like meal I mean like
for dinner every day and I was like dude
this old man is nuts
he told kados every day and Here I am at
23 eating an avocado every single day oh
this is a good question how did your
family come from Cuba both of my parents
were born in Cuba and a funny story of
my parents parents so like my
grandparents on both sides were best
friends in Cuba so my parents knew each
other from when they were a lot smaller
but my dad came first and he came he was
nine years old and they came in a plane
I don't exactly know the situation
because it's not very easy to come from
Cuba but I know that my grandfather was
sent to like a concentration camp for
five years just so that he can bring his
family from Cuba like they made him stay
at a camp and cut sugarcane all day and
my dad and like that family were only
allowed to see my grandfather once a
month I think it was like a big mission
my grandfather went out just to bring
his family from Cuba so it's crazy but
they came in a plane and then and then
my mom came when she was 15 years old
and she came and in muddy aid which if
you don't know what el Mari el is it's a
really long story but that's how she
came it's like a boat thing and she came
anybody you're stranded on an island you
could only bring three make up items
what would they be if I was stranded on
an island the last thing I would be
worried about is makeup favorite Prison
Break character uh Sarah for sure Sarah
like she believed in him the whole time
I love Sarah so much oh and Sucre the
Bob
what is your biggest fear okay I have
mentioned this before I know this is
really really weird but my fave my
biggest fear is like finger amputation I
know it sounds ridiculous but my biggest
fear is to get my fingers cut off like
if I'm being tortured and they take my
fingers off or if I'd accidentally like
chops it off like cutting something like
that is my fear and also to amputation
but not as much as finger amputation
like okay so I totally have mentioned
this before but if you haven't seen any
of my other videos or if you're new to
my channel movie house of wax I used to
be really really obsessed with Chad
Michael Murray growing up like he was
ill of my life so the movie House of Wax
he's in it so I wanted to watch it even
though I don't watch scary movies
there is a part where the girl lives him
she lives her hand through like I don't
even know a sewer I don't know and she's
like calling for help or something and
somebody comes and cuts her finger off
and I had nightmares for a long time
what is your favorite type of cookie
snickerdoodles they are my favorite I'd
live in brigade's for Snicket
snickerdoodles are you working on any
products slash collabs favorite high-end
brand besides Too Faced you know me well
my top two brands are definitely
two-faced and makeup for ever I really
really like this question a lot if you
could have personally witnessed an event
in history what would you want to see
probably I would have wanted to
experience like the first man on the
moon thing that seems so weird I know
but I'm like watching astronaut Wives
right now the show and it's just so
incredible like the I don't know I would
have loved to have been there like
sitting on my couch watching TV like
experiencing like the first man is
on the moon ever nobody has ever been on
the moon and I'm experiencing this right
now
watching the first man touch the moon
it's insane I don't know I would have
liked to yeah what is your favorite
brand for clothes for over 21 because
they're so it's cheap and trendy and
cute and you don't need to spend a lot
of money to look cute so whatever to
anyone how do you deal with the negative
comments I get this one a lot honestly
you guys know that sometimes I go on my
little rants on
snapchat or sometimes I bring it up it's
really hard to completely forget about
negative comments recently I've actually
been a lot better and I have just been
ignoring them for example yesterday
someone had commented on my video saying
that I was vapid it's just really really
hard when you are someone like me who I
make youtube videos and there are beauty
videos and they're like it's dumb beauty
products superficial just material
things that don't mean anything in the
real world don't mean anything in real
life and people will come and tell me
certain things that they think they know
about me that aren't true and just bring
me down a lot so it's really hard to
just completely ignore them and I get so
much love on a daily basis so that is
what I try to focus on so I guess that's
the way I could answer this question I
deal with the negative comments by
focusing on the positive ones but I've
been doing that recently and I mean it's
been work it's been helping and I make
Beauty videos just to get away for the
day just to escape just to take my mind
off of things because to me it's like a
way to relax a way to take my mind off
of life's struggles a way to just unwind
from the real world I used to sit down
before I started making YouTube videos
and watch YouTube videos all day and it
would kind of de-stress me and you know
I was very grateful for the beauty
videos on YouTube because it takes your
mind off of crap for a little while so
that is what I try to do here with my
beauty videos and all that stuff it's
just a place where you can come for a
little bit and just unwind but that is
why I do this I'm not an airhead I'm not
stupid I'm not a dumb girl I'm pretty
intelligent and I will take pride in
that I'm not dumb I'm not fat or
anything like that so yeah so I mean
it's hard to deal with negativity if you
are someone who's dealing with a lot
negativity in your life try to focus on
the positive things try to focus on
friends in your life who make you feel
good you know your best friends or good
friends your parents if you have very
loving parents focus on good things
because then it'll slowly make the
negativity trickle away I don't know
that seems to help with me what is your
favorite drink from Starbucks I get iced
black coffee no cream no sugar usually
but if
if I'm having like a bad day I can't
have that because that gives me like
more anxiety I know that coffee triggers
anxiety and I have anxiety so I
shouldn't be drinking coffee but I can't
help it
um but on a regular day if I'm feeling
naughty I really like these s'mores
Frappuccino it's so good but it's so bad
for you Oh leave me a comment down below
I want to know what your favorite I want
to start getting like fruity drinks from
Starbucks but that are sugar-free like
very low in sugar or you know I'm not
I'm not sure if they even sell sugar
free stuff but fruity drinks that are
very low in sugar leave it down below
would you rather eat mayo off of your
husband's toes or eat wasabi off of his
belly button I rather eat mayo off of
his toes as soon as he comes out of the
shower because I cannot deal with wasabi
or belly buttons if you could live in a
different decade which would it be in
why I would live in the Billie Holiday
decade when she was when Billie Holiday
was Billie Holiday back then it was so
beautiful to me even though a lot of
terrible things were happening like with
society and stuff back then I wouldn't
want to live there for too long I would
be like get me out of this place but
maybe for like two weeks I would like to
live back in the day and like wear that
clothing the fashion was so cute and I
loved it and then men were a little bit
different back then I would just like to
experience that for a little bit just a
little bit but then I would come back to
the 21st century because I like here who
