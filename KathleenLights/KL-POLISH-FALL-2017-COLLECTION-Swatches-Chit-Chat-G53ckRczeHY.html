a really really exciting video I'm gonna
walk you through my entire fall
collection that lunch is tomorrow
September 28th I'm going to show you
swatches of all the colors as usual and
I will be talking names and just these
polishes in general I always do these
videos whenever a new collection
launches just so you can get a better
feel of the color because I know photos
are always super true to color and that
is something we totally struggle with
nail polish is so hard to get right in
photo like the color oh my gosh lighting
there's so many things and it's not
always like spot-on so I like to make
these videos so you can see them swatch
I like to show you one coat and then a
second coat close up and then I just
like to discuss names with you so that
is what we were doing today obviously as
you can tell by my voice I did end up
getting sick I told you his in my last
video which I filmed that one on
Saturday that I was like in the process
of getting sick and yeah I'm sick and I
always get the comments like you aren't
always sick what is wrong with you I
know I'm always sick and it's usually
just when I'm around people who are sick
my friend came over and she was sick and
I got sick right away like the very next
day you know it like upsets a lot of you
but I can't help it but anyway I do feel
pretty crappy I was supposed to film
this video yesterday and it didn't work
because I felt so bad and I've been in
bed all day today coughing and sneezing
so much but I had to get this video up
before the launch so we're just we're
just gonna have to push through it and
deal with it and I'm gonna try to make
this video as simple and short and as
sweet as possible because I just want to
lay down okay so like I mentioned
earlier this collection lunch is
tomorrow Thursday September 28th and we
have six colors like we always do and
this is the Fall collection and there's
kind of like a general basic theme
surrounding each collection like for
summer it was Miami themed and for fall
the photos we took were inspired by the
70s so the Fall collection is called 70s
vibes now we have these really cute
boxes that come with the bundle if you
buy all of the polishes you will get
this really cute box it's limited
edition so the bundles aren't around
forever
once the bundles sell out you can only
get the polishes individually but now we
are including these really cute little
boxes of the name of
collection on the top and you know you
see all the colors and it has a
description of everything you know I
like it stuff on the back and if you do
get the bundle you do get it for $45
which is a discounted price versus
getting them all individually so that's
a great thing saving some money it's
never my thing by the way even though I
am watching these for you I'm gonna
insert photos of my mother well my
mother's hand throw out this video
because she swatched all of them honor
her nails and posted them on Twitter and
I was retweeting all of them as we were
revealing the colors but just in case
you don't follow me on Twitter I'm gonna
be putting up my mom's hand Sawtooth of
all the colors just so you can see them
true to color because she took them
outside under natural lighting so
that'll be super helpful while you're
watching this video but anyway let's go
ahead and jump into these colors I'm
gonna start off with my favorite
favorite one which is the one I'm
wearing on my nails right now this one
is called cozy in there and honestly I'm
not going to describe this color this is
probably the hardest color to photograph
to get through to color to describe
because I think it's such an unique blue
and sometimes it looks more teal
sometimes it looks a little bit more
grey it's like so weird but I love this
color it's my favorite I would describe
this as like a smoky blue grey teal it's
just blue without being blue you know
what I mean and I just think it goes so
well with so many things I love this for
a fall it's deep enough but it's not to
like wintery or vampy I love it it's
amazing this one is really opaque with
just one coat I've worn it a couple of
times with just one coat and it's fine
but I would recommend with all my
polishes just doing two coats a color
just looks better with two coats I don't
know but when you do one coat it kind of
looks more like how it looks in the
bottle I don't know if you can tell but
on my nails it's just a hair deeper and
cozy in there it's actually a reference
to the walking dead if there are any
Walking Dead fans out there you know you
know where this comes from actually
Glenn's first words to Rick when he's in
the tank and Glen talks to him over like
the the walkie-talkie thingy and he's
like hey you dumbass
yeah you in the tank cozy you man I love
that show I love Glenn please no Walking
Dead spoilers in the comments you know
what I'm
talking about their time people who
haven't seen the show and I don't want
to ruin it for them because it's just so
good
so no Walking Dead spoilers down there
yes I just I had to have a Walking Dead
reference eventually right and this one
is cozy in there and I think it's the
perfect name for this polish I love it
so this one is my favorite um this one
is called Mozart it is a really really
interesting purple for those of you who
don't know my least favorite color to
wear on my nails is purple I would wear
any other color before I wear purple on
my nails I don't I don't know why I just
don't think purple looks good on my
nails I don't know but when I was
creating this color my mum loved it like
so many people in my life were so crazy
over this color and I was like I like it
but it's not my favorite but the more I
tested it out because obviously I have
to test out my own polishes but the more
I tested it out and the more I wore it
off camera of course the more I really
liked it there's like this smoky
undertone to it a lot of the colors in
this collection kind of have like a
dirty smoky undertone which is perfect
for fall and if I have to wear a purple
this is the kind of purple I like
because it's not too loud or too vibrant
and steep enough but colourful enough I
really really like this one a lot and it
looks good on every single skin tone
it's beautiful I actually named it
Mozart because that is what my dad calls
me kind of stems from the word mama
my entire family calls me mama and
growing up my dad always called me like
mama or ma or mo and then mo turned it
to Mozart somehow and my entire life
he's called me Mozart and the weird
thing is that we had no idea like he
just started calling me Mozart but
Mozart and I actually share a birthday
Mozart was born January 27th which i
think is kind of weird and kind of cool
at the same time and honestly for some
reason when I looked at this shade the
first thing that came into my mind was
Mozart like I just just like all that
totally looks like a Mozart I don't know
my brain is weird next up is this
majestic creature here right here I
honestly didn't think I was going to
love this color as much as I do
it's honestly when I pictured a melted
penny to look like but it's a little bit
more golden than that a penny has kind
of like a bronze undertone this one does
have a little bit of a golden shift it's
a copper with a little bit of gold in it
I don't know why do this I love this one
so
because I find it to be so unique it's
not okay you guys know that's what she
said
which was like the metallic pink silver
I came out with for spring that one is
like a true chrome this one is as well
but it has little tiny microscopic
flecks in it so it's very minimal but it
makes such a difference on the nails the
nails look so stunning I love this color
even my mom who never wears colors like
this when she finally put an orange I
was like wow I like this way more than I
thought I would and so do i and it's one
of my favorites in this collection it
just makes your nails stand out so much
when I wear it I always get compliments
on this color it's unreal and pretty
much how I came up with this color I
honestly wanted a nail polish version of
the color pop eyeshadow in the shade
kathleenlights from though where the
light is quater that I created with
color pop it's like a very copper
beautiful eyeshadow I love it and I
wanted a nail polish version of that so
that's kind of what this is they
obviously are different this is a nail
polish that's an eye shadow but they're
very similar and I love how it turned
out and I thought the perfect name for
it would be princess penny if you're
American Ashley fan like I am I don't
keep up with how much these days but
they have a movie called to
grandmother's house we go and princess
painting is actually what they want for
Christmas it's like this classic Barbie
doll and her name is princess penny so
that is what I named this this one is
called wishbone and it's the nude in the
collection and it's my favorite nude so
far and I got a lot of questions asking
me if this is really similar to
snickerdoodle
and it actually is not they're like not
even close it might look like they are
in the bottles but snickerdoodle is a
nude as well but it's a very warm nude
almost has like a brownish
undertone and then wishbone has more of
a gray undertone you can see here this
one looks good on every single skin tone
while snickerdoodle in my opinion
personally looks good on medium to
really deep skin tones or very very very
fair skin tones this one looks good on
everyone it's truly like such a pretty
nude very very creamy and very opaque
and I named it wishbone because of the
show wishbone I don't know if any of you
guys were into that show when you were
younger but I certainly was I am
obsessed with Jack Russell Terriers I've
had like 5 in my life
time I love them there's such whacky
dogs but they're so fun are you still
alive show okay so let's talk about this
bad boy right here when I was creating
the Fall collection for this year this
is the first color I thought of it's one
of my favorite colors to wear in the
fall time like clothing wise it's not
extremely unique or anything I mean it's
a classic olivey army green but such a
staple for fall I just I had to have to
create a color like this I love it I see
myself using this a ton this fall even
though you wouldn't think this is a
color you would typically put on your
nails it's more like a clothing color
but on the nails it looks really really
good
this one is called Chloe it's the name
we have in this collection I want to do
this thing where I have a name in every
single collection just names that
pertain to my life in one way or another
and maybe they pertain to yours as well
so it's something to relate to I just
think it's really cool you know to be
named Zoe and be wearing my Zoe nail
polish I renamed Chloe while wearing
Chloe nail polish I just think it's kind
of cool and Chloe is actually my friend
Melissa my friend who got me sick the
other day Chloe is her dog that's right
her dog I wish I could tell you how it
happened this way but let's just say I
lost a bit once I lost that bet I had to
name a nail polish after her dog so here
we are here's Chloe and then last but
not least we have this gorgeous
beautiful shining star this one is
called Prince Cornelius and it is the
most beautiful reddish-brown bronze ever
it has a really strong red undertone
especially on the first coat when you do
the first coat you see a lot of that red
peek through but once you do with that
second coat you get that really pretty
Brown bronze color to it it has gold
glitter in it but the gold glitter is so
fine it's not chunky at all it almost
kind of looks like a sheen like when you
move your fingers in the light you kind
of hit that gold shimmer but it's not
too much it's not too in-your-face it's
like just beautiful to me it's
Thanksgiving in a bottle like I am 100%
wearing this on Thanksgiving I love this
color it's fall it's screams fall and
the reason I named it Prince Cornelius
is because of Thumbelina Thumbelina was
one of my favorite movies growing up
I saw it every single day for years and
then when I was 16 years old got
Cornelius my dog the only thing is
Prince Cornelius his name is spelled
differently than how I named it on the
bottle and I got so many comments
telling me that I named that I spelled
Cornelius wrong I was intentional the
nail polish is named after Prince
Cornelius from Thumbelina but kind of
named after my dog Cornelius
so I had to I had to spell Cornelius the
way I spell it for my dog it's the same
thing as like when you have a name
that's typically spelled a certain way
but your mom or your dad decided to
spell in a different way I knew to
Ashley's in middle school one of them
was spelled L EE does that mean her mom
spelled it wrong no it's just sometimes
you spell things differently but anyway
those were the colors in the collection
by the way I love how much you guys are
so involved with Cael polish and all the
positive comments you leave all the time
and I love getting your input and I love
