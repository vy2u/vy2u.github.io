exciting did I just spit everywhere I'm
giving you guys a bonus video today and
if there's anybody who's gonna say hey
there was no video yesterday this is not
a bonus video just a blessed video
yesterday it was just posted like at
9:30 p.m. but there was a video
yesterday you can go back and check but
I'm giving you guys a bonus video today
because we have some very exciting news
and I'm so sorry i if I seem buried down
in this video I'm so bummed because my
heart is really excited and I'm very
very happy but my body is very tired
I've been up since 6:00 in the morning
and it is almost midnight and I have to
film this video edit it and post it
tomorrow at 9 in the morning so it's
gonna be a long night even if I may seem
very calm I'm very excited my heart is
so excited kale polish has officially
expanded their range today a new product
launches today well right now you can
get a brand new kale polish product it's
not nail polish it's hand cream
I'm sure you guys have already seen this
on social media or if you follow the
kale polish YouTube channel which if you
don't why not follow the koalas utopian
I'm gonna link it down below if you guys
saw the cute little video we did in the
warehouse like in the lab and stuff it
was so fun
but kale polish I can't even believe I'm
saying this but we have head cream and
I'm gonna talk about it with you guys in
this video because I've gotten so many
questions ever since Kol polish posted
the announcement video on this you guys
have been wanting me to talk about it in
just all the details so that's what I'm
doing for you guys right now okay so I
knew when starting kale polish that I
eventually wanted to expand their range
and not just release nail polish like
maybe do base coats top coats maybe nail
polish remover maybe hand cream maybe
dotting tools I don't maybe stickers I
mean I don't know I just knew that I
wanted to expand and I wanted to just do
things there were all things nails and
hands you know no I just knew that I
wanted to do more to wanted to do it
with products and things that just made
sense with the brand obviously and our
first different launch is
the hand cream I wanted something that
looked kind of vintage an old-school but
very like modern and pretty at the same
time I kind of wanted a toothpaste style
packaging but I didn't want it to be the
actual tin because I've actually had a
couple hand creams in the tin packaging
I'm and it's really cute like so cute I
love it but I've had hand creams pop on
me in the past like if you bend it a
certain way the aluminum kind of like
gets stuck there and you can pop a hole
in it and I did not want that to happen
with this so I wanted like a toothpaste
style packaging but that it wasn't gonna
be like tin but I loved the material I
love the packaging on this and then you
do have a little twist off cap here and
then this is a brand new one you just
take the little old thing up I mean you
know how hanging cream works right and
then you just pour it out and it's
amazing and we actually made the hole
pretty big here on this so just be
careful with that if you're someone who
squeezes hard squeeze gently with this
guy you get used to it really really
fast but I liked the like bigger pack
it's like the bigger opening I went
through so many different formulas a
month and months and months of testing
out different hand creams different
formulas different scents I've been
working on this for a very very very
very long time I'm kind of picky when it
comes to hand cream and I really wanted
this to be something that I can use I
just want something that smells really
good and that just is not greasy on my
hand something that's gonna sink in
after like five minutes I'm not gonna
feel it but yet my hands are still gonna
feel hydrated and less dry which is
exactly what this does it doesn't leave
a weird like greasy mess and slip enos
on your hands I hate that this sinks
right into the skin and the best part is
that a little does go a very long way
you can use just a pea-sized amount of
this and it really does just hydrate
your hands and within like five minutes
it doesn't feel like you're wearing
anything but it still feels good I don't
know I really really love it now this is
almond scented I wanted to give it a
scent because when I'm personally
putting on hand cream I just love
smelling it I love scented hand creams
for a while there I was thinking about
releasing an unscented version or at
least starting off with something that's
unscented but I thought that was gonna
be boring and I didn't know if people
were gonna like it so I went with my
favorite hand cream
debora like my favorite scent ever
besides coconut I love almond scented
things shampoo like perfumes like if I
just love the smell of almonds kind of
reminds me of cherries I know that
sounds really weird but to me almonds
kind of smell like rich cherries that's
just me but this is also where you guys
come in in the future for example let's
say you're a fan of this formula but
you're not exactly a fan of the scent in
the future what kind of sense would you
like to see I mean are you guys
interested in an unscented version is
that like more your thing I just would
love to know what scent you prefer in a
hand cream if I get a wave of requests
like you wow my hair is looks crazy if I
get a wave of requests you just never
know so I would love to hear your input
I definitely need your feedback on this
product this is a very new thing for me
so I would love to hear what you guys
think about the formula about the scent
just everything in general so I'm just
trying to make it out here you know I'm
just trying to make good products for
you and I want you guys to enjoy
everything so I'm very proud of this I
personally love it I would love to know
what you guys think for those of you
wondering about the formula I mean
there's more information on the website
you guys can see the ingredients all
that good stuff but I did have a couple
things written down that I wanted to
tell you guys you know I wrote things
down to prepare myself but this is
paraben free sulfate free cruelty free
fat leak free I don't know say that word
it's free of that as well alcohol free
SLS free it's also vegan and it retails
for $12 this does have 2.5 fluid ounces
in it which is roughly about less than
$5 per ounce
compared to your hand I would say this
is a pretty large like well I guess I'd
like the size in my head I had a pretty
large head so it is pretty big but this
does fit perfectly in your purse I've
traveled with it like in my carry-on
it's all good I personally love this
size I also really wanted to hunt him
because we got a ton of questions about
this which I can't believe I didn't even
think to maybe like make a little
disclaimer in that video or whatever but
I got so many questions about the almond
scent like if it was artificial or if it
was like real almonds because I know
there's a lot of people who have a nut
allergy can't believe I didn't even
think of that but I just want to let you
know the almond fragrance in this
is synthetic but it does contain 0.1 so
not like 1% 0.1% of almond oil in it so
just in case I just in case we recommend
you doing like a patch test on your skin
making sure you're ok with it if you do
have a nut allergy I think you'll be
fine but definitely do a patch patch
test if you have a nut allergy just to
be safe even though it is synthetic
fragrance there is that 0.1% of almond
oil so I want you guys to be safe very
important but yeah I can't wait to see
what you guys think about this and just
so nervous about this launch like like
trembling nervous I've been so anxious
leading up to this moment I just wanted
to go well so I hope you guys like this
I love this I've gone through like 5
bottles already so I was Amelia so I was
like everybody in my family they have
been testing out hand creams with me for
months now and everybody's just like so
excited to finally see this much I think
it would be cool like in the future to
do like different colors maybe like if I
ever come out with a different scent to
maybe do like a mint kind of color or
something I don't I don't just
brainstorming here out loud with you
guys I'm gonna go and wash my hair now
and then go to bed no I have to end this
video gosh man I'm gonna be up all night
um I think that's all I wanted to say I
know that this video went by fast but I
mean the prize formula you know how did
you concern I feel like I touched
everything I wrote down that I wanted to
talk about so yeah that completes this
video guys I hope you're just as excited
as I am I hope you check it out I love
you guys so much thank you guys so much

haven't already and I will see you in my
next video bye
