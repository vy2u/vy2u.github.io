you a Thursday video today so we can
talk about my ethereal garden collection
as you guys know my kale polish spring
collection has officially launched today
is the official launch day but we did
have some early access for the box sets
on Tuesday every time we do a launch we
always kind of launch the bundle first a
couple days before the official launch
so today is the official launch of my
ethereal gardening collection which is
the name of the spring collection if you
guys didn't know and as always every
time we do a launch I sit down and I
talk to you guys about the names about
the colors I show you guys swatches and
we just talk about it and I upload them
on Thursdays or on Tuesdays or during
the weekends or whatever just so that
these videos don't interrupt
my three videos a week scheduled this is
always a bonus video I give you guys if
you guys aren't used to these videos
basically I go over everything and I do
swatches on my little plastic nails I do
one coat and then I do two coats just so
you can see how it looks with two coats
also my mom loves to do swatches for you
guys every time we reveal a color on
Instagram my mom reveals that shade like
on her actual nails swatched for you
guys it's like her favorite thing to do
for ko polish now so I'm gonna be
inserting those photos let's get into
the colors let's get into the reason why
you're here the first one is Miss
Kensington and this is a very beautiful
mint shade it's not too minty green I
wanted something that had a little bit
more of like a seafoam touch to it so it
has a little bit of both I love this
color I love it for spring I just think
mint nails for spring it's just so
beautiful and when I was coming up with
the name of this color I looked at it
and for some reason it reminded me of
the dress that Clarice Kensington wore
and it takes two when Amanda Lemon well
supposed to be Alyssa Calloway but it
was really Amanda Lemon when Amanda was
playing the piano and it was a hot mess
that green dress that Clarice was
wearing it like reminded me of this and
it's not the exact color at all it just
reminded me of that when I looked at it
and usually I always just go with my gut
whenever I look at something and I think
of the name immediately that's always
what I named it so I went with Miss
and I think it's such a pretty name for
such a pretty polish I don't know I
really really like this next up we have
one of our most unique polishes we've
ever created it's such a hard color for
me to describe it's kind of like a
magenta purple pink dual chrome like
flip kind of color I hate to say this
because you guys know how I feel about
the whole like unicorn trend but it's a
very unicorn nail polish in the bottle
it looks so nice but when you apply it
on your nails and you see it in the
sunlight like under direct sunlight it
looks so magical and beautiful it is
literally the most like ethereal polish
ever I love it and I was actually having
a lot of trouble naming this one I would
just stare at this polish for hours and
nothing was coming to my mind I didn't
want to go in like a mermaid direction
or like a unicorn direction because I
know it's just it's too much already but
I still wanted the name to be a little
bit magical so I asked you guys on
Twitter I'm not sure if you guys even
remember this for those of you who
follow me on Twitter I asked you guys
what you pictured a blue purple
duochrome II kind of nail polish to be
called and there was actually a few of
you guys who said charmed I think like
four or five of you said charms and I
thought that was such a great idea so I
went with charmed so thank you so much
to everyone who participated in that you
always constantly give me amazing ideas
for Kayle polish and i thought it was
just perfect because i honestly love
that show i don't know if you guys have
seen the show charms it's like an old
90s which show was actually the show
that I watched non-stop when Danny was
on deployment like on his last
deployment I binge
charmed for months and months so it's
just a show I really really love and I
love that this is called that okay so
the direction I went with last spring
was a little bit different the colors
weren't as pastel they weren't as
eastery but for this spring I actually
really wanted colors that just screamed
Easter I know not everybody celebrates
Easter but I mean Easter kind of screams
spring anyway so you know it doesn't
really matter but I wanted Easter II
colors and like creamy yummy pastel
shades and I knew I knew that I needed a
bubblegum pink that wasn't too pink that
wasn't too bubblegum II so it is a
a bit more white based than your typical
bubblegum pink but this looks so nice on
the nails it really just makes your
nails stand out if you're a fan of those
milky Pink's I think you would really
really like this and this one is called
gum would be perfection which I'm so
happy so many of you guys love the name
of this one at first what I named it I
was like oh my gosh every we're gonna
think this name is too long but I
decided to just go with my gut and I
love this name if you guys have seen the
show friends if you're a huge friends
fan then you know exactly where this is
from
I had a friend's reference in my last
spring collection as well now that I
think about it but if you guys have ever
seen The Blackout episode I believe it's
called the one with the blackout Jill
Goodacre asks Chandler if he wants gum
first he says no and then he says gum
would be perfect it's like a thing it's
like a thing you know what second
thought gum would be perfection would be
perfection
so the said gum would be nice could have
said I'll have a stick but no no no for
me gum
is perfection I even have this phrase
like written on a shirt so I knew the
second I created a bubblegum pink color
that that was gonna be the name so this
is gum would be perfection and I
freaking love it okay so next up we have
the name in the collection you guys know
I make it a point to come out with at
least one name in every single
collection think it's like a fun little
game to see whose name comes up next and
I just think it's cool to have a nail
polish that's name that's your name
maybe I'm just a weirdo like that but I
think it's cute and for the spring we
have Selene and of course I named this
one Selene after my precious little
angel Selene that's the name of my dog I
felt like I owed it to her because I
have a prince Cornelius and a porter
Miami and we didn't have any Celine's
yet so for some reason even though this
looks nothing like Celine's hair or like
the coat of Selene I looked at this
color and I just wanted to name it
Selene really really love this color I
know there are a lot of people out there
who don't love yellow polish but this is
a very different yellow polish in my
opinion it's not a creamy white like
baby yellow it's not a baby yellow at
all it kind of has like a jizan
undertone it's not really a mustardy
undertone but it's like a
dirty light yellow man I don't know how
to explain this one at all this is
actually a color that a lot of people
look at like a lot of personal people in
my life don't look at this and they'll
be like oh it's not my favorite but then
they'll try it on their nails and they
love it that was the case for my mom
that was the case for Amelia and you
can't really tell so much on the nails
but this has tiny tiny tiny little
silver micro glitter all throughout it
and in the sunlight it kind of makes
your nails look a little bit shinier
than usual but it's not something that's
too noticeable it definitely looks like
a cream once you apply it to your nails
but it does give it a little bit of
something-something
I love Selene it's actually my most worn
out of all of them just because I think
it's so fun and unique and I wear it all
the time it's just really hard to wear
colors when you're trying to keep them
secret from your subscribers it's like
every time I would go film a video I had
to take it off and put something you
guys have already seen sometimes I would
just be like you know what I'm gonna
film with it on whatever but it's a
challenge to film three times a week and
also be testing colors non-stop you guys
have no idea what a challenge it is okay
so next up is actually my favorite in
the entire collection if I had to choose
just one this is the color I would pick
this is the shade dream boy
it is my dream spring nail polish color
if I could have just one color on my
nails like throughout all of spring it
would either be a white or it would be
this color I love how this looks on
literally every single skin tone I mean
all these colors look great on all skin
tones but this one your skin tone just
looks so nice with this it kind of makes
my skin look a little bit more tan than
it usually does whenever I wear a dream
boy I don't know it really is such a
pretty color it's kind of like a light
lack but it has a little bit of blue to
it depending on where you're standing in
the light sometimes it looks purple
sometimes it looks blue it honestly is a
light blurple it's kind of like a
periwinkle purple yeah it's like a
periwinkle is that what you would call
this I'm gonna go with purple it is a
beautiful beautiful creamy finish
there's no shimmer no glitter I've
gotten a lot of questions about this
color and saying that it looks too
similar to hug and roll but actually if
you put them side by side hug and roll
it doesn't really look anything like
DreamBoy I mean they both have a little
bit of purple to them but as you can
tell with DreamBoy is a little bit more
blue
just so you guys can see it compared to
st. Claire as well this is st. Claire
right here and this is dream boy as you
can see next to st. Claire it looks a
little bit more purple so it really does
depend I'd actually named this one dream
boy mainly because I thought the name
was cute like Oh dream boy but I was
listening to the song you're my dream
boy mm mm when I was sitting there
trying to figure out the name of this
one literally I was listening to it on
my headphones and I was like oh my god
dream boy you guys know what song I'm
talking about let me see if I could find
it for you I was listening to it the
other day okay and then last but not
least we have the sheer polish in the
collection I was getting so many
questions about this which is why I love
doing these videos because this is
actually sheer on purpose I was getting
so many questions asking like why it
wasn't super opaque like the other ones
but I'm not sure if you guys know those
type of polishes that are kind of like
jelly polishes they're not a cream
finish but they're not shimmery they
don't have any glitter or anything they
just kind of look a little bit
see-through and generally like and I
really wanted one for spring I wanted a
polish so you could just throw on your
nails two coats and that you didn't
really have to clean up on the edges you
know something that you didn't have to
work too hard with but that still looked
nice and milky and put together I wanted
something that was a little bit like
peachy pink somewhere in between because
I didn't want it to be too pink and I
didn't want it to look like peachy yes
somewhere in the middle and this is the
color like you can see right here next
to them would be perfection how much
more peachy it is this is like the
perfect bride color for an anniversary
or something like that this is such an
effortless easy polish and it always
looks good because it's kind of like a
nude you know it just like goes with
everything
and I love it I'm actually wearing this
on my nails right now I have it all over
all my nails but on these two nails
right here and on these two nails I have
that suspense of 26 on top of it this
guy right here this was actually my
go-to combo for months guys for like the
past two months I actually wore it in a
few videos that was veni vidi Sonique II
about it this is
my favorite combo ever when it comes to
that suspense of 26 like the best polish
to put underneath this guy is pinky they
just go together so well and it creates
like honestly like ballerina nails
ballerina fairy magical nails I swear I
love this combo so much two coats of
this one coat of that but I also love
this polish completely on its own and I
actually did not name this one this is
actually the nail polish that Danny
named and it was kind of funny because I
was actually going back and forth with
the name of this for weeks
this had 87 different names was actually
named strawberry milkshake for a really
long time but then for some reason I
kept thinking in my head like I don't
even drink strawberry milkshakes I don't
drink milkshakes dairy messes it must
dumbing so I don't know why for that
reason I was just not set on the name I
kept pulling back and forth and back and
forth and my cam polish people were like
dude you need a name so it was kind of
on a little bit of a time crunch and
honestly I was just so frustrated but I
had the nail polish it's all like laid
out like this and lift it I looked at
Danny and I was like what do you think
of when you see this and the first thing
that comes out of your mouth is what I
am naming this know if ands or buts what
you say next is the name of this polish
and then Danny kind of looked at it and
stared at it for a while after like a
minute he was like pinkie and just the
way he said it it was so funny to me I
didn't expect him to say that I thought
he was gonna say something like Ludacris
something insane but he was like kind of
looks pinky like the most basic name
ever but I thought it was so cute and
that's what I went with you just kind of
pinky isn't it
hey it's fitting I think so those were
the six colors from my 2018 ethereal
garden spring collection from kale
polish it's so amazing to say that I
can't believe this is our second spring
lunch it feels like we just launched
kale polish like last week and we're
