video I'm sure some of you are confused
as to why there's a video going up today
and actually this video was supposed to
go up tomorrow there was supposed to be
a different video going up today but in
today's video I'm gonna be walking you
through my ko polish winter collection
I'm really excited to show you guys the
colors as you guys know in all these
videos I show you swatches I talk about
why I named them what I named them and
all that good stuff and I've been
noticing some comments recently where
some of you for you I've been kind of
posting less beauty videos lately just
because there's so many launches
especially for kale polish and it's just
a lot going on which I'm so grateful for
but I know that some of you really
missed the beauty videos which is why
I'm posting an extra video this week
which is today I don't know I'm thinking
that every time I do one of these
collection videos I'll probably do it on
a Thursday so that it doesn't interfere
with my normal like videos so let me
know how that sounds in the comments let
me know if that's something you would
appreciate or not so I don't want this
video to be too long I feel like I talk
so much in all of these videos so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get started this
is what the box looks like I wanted it
to be really simple for winter it's just
a black box on the top that says winter
glamour land which is kind of like the
theme we have going on in this winter we
always name the collections based on the
photo shoots like for fall we had a very
70s themed photo shoot so the box is
very 70s themed and for winter this year
we have like a very glam photo shoot
everything was about like the gowns and
the sparkle and it was very glamorous so
I kind of made a joke to the people over
at kale polish I was like oh my gosh
what about winter glamour land and I
totally meant that as a joke I didn't
think anybody could have taken me
seriously I thought they were gonna be
like no and everybody liked that name so
we ended up going with it so it is
winter glamour language I think it's
kind of corny but I kind of like it at
the same time and you can actually buy
this bundle today I know that on social
media we've been posting that the
collection lunch is tomorrow which it
technically does everything does launch
tomorrow but you can buy the bundle
exclusively today like tomorrow you can
buy all the Polish and all the polishes
individually like for example if you
just want a sand central park you can do
that tomorrow but if you were planning
on buying the box anyway it is now
currently available to
just the box and the reason we're doing
that is just so we can get all the box
orders out as soon as we can so if
you're planning on buying the bundle
tomorrow you can do it today if you were
just planning on buying like two or
three Shane's you will have to wait till
tomorrow I'm gonna link the Kol polish
website down below and I really really
really want to emphasize this and I need
to mention this but if you wait until
about after December 13th to buy these
boxes or these polishes we cannot
guarantee that you will get them by
Christmas if you wait till after
December 13th just because you know how
crazy the holidays are and we are not
the only company getting shipped out of
warehouses things can delay during the
holidays so I would highly suggest if
you want this before Christmas that you
get it now and also if you are an
international subby we have
international shipping now which is
amazing I ship some of the beginning of
this video we now have international
shipping we have been working so hard to
get this it's been like a full year
since we launched and we've been working
on trying to get it and it's been a
struggle but we're here now we now have
international shipping and of course
with international orders things take
even longer to ship so I would suggest
getting gift cards if you are overseas
and you want a little ko polish love for
Christmas I would highly suggest getting
gift cards check out the KO polish
website we do have gift cards to offer
and we have really cool stocking
stuffers and really good stuff so I will
link the KO polish website below but now
let's get into the colors let's get into
the reason why you're here while I tell
you guys all the colors I will be
showing you pictures of my mom wearing
all the colors I did this in my last
while I've been doing this actually like
the past two launches every time we
reveal a color on Instagram my mom will
post her swatches on Twitter and then
I'll retweet it so make sure you are
following me on Twitter if you want to
see actual swatches on the nails of each
color once we reveal this shade because
obviously with the sneak peek photos you
can't really tell that well you know so
my mom always posts photos for you guys
but I will be inserting the pictures in
this video to bring all the colors on
her nails under natural light like she
always takes the photo under natural
light like in front of her plants do you
take those plants very seriously she
loves those plants and she loves taking
photos of her
in front of those plants so anyway let's
get into these colors so I wanted that
winter collection to be a mix of like
fun and Christmasy yet very vampy as
well and this is one of my favorite
collections that we've ever come out
with it's so funny my friend Stephanie
ever since we created this collection
she's been calling it the Stephanie
collection and it's her favorite and she
hasn't shut up about it and here we are
we're launching it Stephanie isn't it
crazy we've worked so hard on this and
honestly take your order I'm gonna get
started okay so first up we have Mindy
and this one is stunning on everyone I
love this color it's a very deep berry I
don't really love berry nail polishes on
me so I wanted this one to be a little
bit deeper than your typical berry shade
and I love it is that like creme finish
it doesn't have any shimmer to it it's
so delicious and you do one coat the
berry really shows through but once you
add the second coat it does get nice and
deep and I love it and I named it Mindy
after Mindy Kaling which is one of my
favorite people in the entire freaking
world she's so funny and so smart and
amazing and I love her so much I love
everything she does the Mindy projects
one of my favorite shows she's in the
office which is great and she's just so
amazing I love her and you guys know I
always have a name in every single
collection I do just because I don't
know it's something I want to do I want
to add a name in every collection and
this collection has Mindy I've always
known I wanted to name a polish after
her and ya know I have next up we have
casino night and I got a ton of comments
about this when we revealed it asking me
how similar it was to - offensive and
they do look similar nothing alike this
is that offensive as you can see in the
bottles they do look similar first of
all that's offensive was limited edition
we no longer sell this polish and it was
such a hit I wanted to create something
like it but that was different obviously
and that offensive has so much more
silver in it it's kind of like a
champagne glitter casino night is very
much gold like this this stuff is gold
and also casino night is a lot chunkier
than this one not like in the gross
negative way it's just that suspensive
has such a fine glitter all the little
glitter particles are very very very
small and I suspensive but when you look
at Cassie
no night the chunks of glitter are a lot
thicker have like larger pieces of
glitter in this guy and it just looks so
cool I love using this as like an accent
nail polish I'm actually wearing it on
these two nails right here I'm wearing
Central Park on all of my nails but then
right here on these two nails I have
kind of like a little golden Christmas
tree effect that I try to create if this
nail polish screams holiday and I love
it and I named a casino night after the
office if you're an office fan you know
exactly what episode this is this is the
name of an episode in the office a huge
moment for Jim and Pam like this episode
pulls at your heartstrings like like
nothing ever will you know what I'm
talking about you know Casino Night cuz
you know night broke all of our hearts
it really did next up we have graham
which is a really pretty gray color I
don't even know how to describe the
undertone in this it's just like a gray
polish and I also got a lot of questions
about this one asking me to compare it
to wishbone which it is totally
different from wishbone I know it looks
like it might be similar and even it
damn even in the bottles they look
similar but in my opinion these really
aren't that similar at all wishbone is a
cool tone nude and Graham is a gray like
there's no way around that Graham is
great and there's something about this
color that's just so cool to me
but this color is so beautiful it's also
a creme finish and it's very very opaque
you could pretty much get away with just
using one coat of this guy but of course
I always recommend to and I love it it's
the perfect light shade during the
winter and I named it Graham after
Graham in the holiday which the holiday
is one of my top 5 favorite movies of
all time like definitely in my top 5
overall but it is my favorite Christmas
movie or like my favorite holiday movie
it's not just focused around curse
misses the holiday and when we first
launched Kayla polish like the first six
colors I ever came out with it was
during this time of year we've already
been around for one year which is crazy
to even think but our first collection
ever was launched in December I can't I
can't even believe that it's insane but
anyway I have a color in there that's
called gumption which is also a term
from the holiday so I kind of made it a
point in my mind to name one polish in
every winter collection after the
they so this year we have Graham okay
next up we have one of my favorites this
is the nail polisher I'm wearing right
now it is called Central Park and this
one is a very very very dark green like
a dark forest green but I wouldn't even
consider it like forest green it's just
it's deeper than that it's almost like a
blackened green I mean in natural
daylight you can totally tell it's green
especially under the Sun it really looks
like a forest green but I love that it's
so dark shade is beautiful for the
winter and I named it Central Park
because it truly reminded me of Central
Park
not that the trees are this historic but
I don't know why it really did I've only
been to New York once but when I was
there completely fell in love with
Central Park I was like blown away by it
even though it's so simple I found it so
beautifully I've always wanted to make
my nail polish after Central Park and
then when I saw this color I was like oh
my god this perfect Central Park and I
got so many comments from you guys
saying like why didn't you just name it
Central Perk but guys I wasn't trying to
make a friends reference I really just
wanted to name it after the park so
that's what I did and a little piece
color is so beautiful okay now we have
the showstopper why I call it the
showstopper this is the perfect red this
one is called ace and it is a true like
firetruck Christmas red it's really
perfect to me I love this color so much
I think it's a staple and everybody's
like nail polish collection it looks
good on every skin tone no matter what
like this type of red looks gorgeous on
everyone asking that a lot of questions
about magic City and how it looked
compared to Magic City they are totally
different Magic City is a lot more neon
as you can tell this one has like a
poppy neon undertone like very very
electric this one is more like a classic
red I did a poll months ago I don't know
if you guys remember I did a poll on
Twitter and I asked you guys what color
do you think of when you hear the word
at Ace and I put white black or red and
I'm pretty sure red won by a little bit
I think black was like really close but
red did win which I was so thankful for
because I was kind of like in the
process of naming this one ace anyway so
I'm glad you guys agreed with me and I
think it's the perfect name but I
actually named it ace after Logan from
Gilmore Girls well he calls Rory ace his
name isn't ace but that's what he calls
her and I think it's perfect and now
every time I wear the
nail polish I think of Logan and Rory
and I loved it and before all you
jesting lovers come for me I'm team
Logan
which is weird usually always go for the
underdog but Jessie can be really mean
like if you look back and you watch
Gilmore Girls again as an adult Jessie
doesn't really show up that much he's
kind of like I'll talk sometimes you
know he's kind of like I don't know I
love him but like I just I love Logan
obviously not in the new season that
just came out on Netflix like the I
think it's called a year in the life
obviously I'm not team Logan anymore
now I like Jessie but in the old show
the original show I'm team ace what can
I say
okay and last but certainly not least we
have this shade right here and this one
is called Cassiopeia and I can't even
describe the shade I wanted something
that looked like a galaxy something Star
Wars II like I was really going in the
Star Wars ear out with this guy and this
just looks so Star Wars II to me by the
way but we were sitting down creating
the name for this polish I don't know if
it was Stephanie who came up with the
name I'm pretty sure it was we were
trying to think of winter names and then
we started thinking about serendipity
the movie have you guys seen it with
John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale it's
great if you love a love story such a
beautiful movie and it's a Christmas
movie and it's amazing and in that movie
he talks about Cassiopeia which if you
didn't know Cassiopeia is a
constellation in the northern sky and
it's Greek mythology and he talks about
it in the movie he like draws it on her
arm and they have like a beautiful
romantic moment about Cassiopeia and I
think it was Stephanie who was like oh
my gosh Cassiopeia cuz this looks like
the sky like the night sky you know and
I was like that is perfect and I love
this color I think it is so cool I am
100% wearing this color on New Year's
Eve like definitely this is the perfect
New Year's Eve shade so cool but yeah
guys those were all the six colors I
hope you enjoyed this like story time
and swatch video I hope you guys enjoy
these videos and I hope they are helpful
yeah guys I hope you enjoyed this video
