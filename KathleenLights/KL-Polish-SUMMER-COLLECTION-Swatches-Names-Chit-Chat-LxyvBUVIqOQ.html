really really exciting one we're going
to be talking all about my summer
collection I have been so anxious to
film this video because I have to be
honest I'm just going to say it this is
my favorite collection so far and I'm
just so excited to be here talking to
you guys all about it by the way if you
have no idea what I'm talking about I
have my own brand of nail polish called
KL polish I will have my website linked
down below all that good stuff will be
in the description box which I'm sure
most of you know but my summer
collection officially launches tomorrow
if you are watching this video the day I
posted my collection launches tomorrow
so I knew and had to get a video up
today showing you swatches talking about
the name and just giving you details
about each color just so you're a little
bit more informed and you can make up
your own decision whether you want to
purchase any of these or not before I
get started though I want to give you
guys a huge thank you every time we
posted a new picture Onkyo polish or on
my Instagram you guys were so nice and
just so sweet and caring in the comments
it warmed my heart so much and it
literally brought me to tears multiple
times you guys are the best subscribers
I could have ever asked for you always
make me feel good and confident and I
cannot thank you enough for that and I
hope that my channel does the same for
you I know we're not sitting one-on-one
but you're my friend and I care about
you and just thank you for subscribing
to me I just I love you okay so I just
quickly wanted to mention that because
you guys are the best subscribers in the
world before I get into color swatches
and names and stuff I do want to mention
a lot of you guys asked me if this is
going to be available as a bundle the
same way the spring line was and yes the
collection will be available in a bundle
and you do save a little bit of money if
you go that route but of course you
don't have to buy all of them and you
can get them individually all right like
talk about the colors I'm going to start
off with my favorite one out of the
entire collection because that's how I
like to start with these videos and that
one has to be Porter Miami this is a
true cobalt blue I mean I wouldn't
consider this like pure cobalt I feel
like cobalt is a little bit lighter than
this but this is definitely not royal
blue and feel like it's somewhere in the
middle and honestly when I thought about
kale polish I had two polishes in mind
the first one was got a middle I know
that that's the one I wanted to make
it's still my number one favorite so far
but this is the second nail polish I
thought that I needed to create because
it is literally my favorite color to
wear on my nails any kind of cobalt blue
Zimmern on shimmer mats I just love this
blue shade it is definitely my favorite
every time I wear it I cannot stop
staring at my nails it is absolutely
beautiful and all of these have the
exact same formula I know it seems silly
for me to have to say that but you would
be surprised at how many people ask me
if the formula changes based on the nail
polish but no application and color and
opacity and stuff like that viscosity
that changes but formula stays
absolutely the same my formula will not
change I absolutely love my formula so
always remember that and this color is
actually almost a 1 coder if you apply
it right you can get away with just
doing one coat but I definitely
recommend two coat it's really gorgeous
and I got a lot of questions about this
name oh by the way I completely forgot
to mention that but my summer collection
I kind of dedicated it to Miami it's the
place I live it's the place I was born I
was born and raised here and when I
think of summer I just think of Miami so
I wanted to dedicate my first summer
collection to Miami and all of the names
are Miami related so this one it's
border Miami and I got so many questions
about this
I actually was asked is I supposed Port
of Miami wrong which I can totally
understand if you have no idea that I
have a dog named Porter but I have a
Yorkie named Porter and she's my best
friend and I mean I love all three of my
dogs you're not going to be wrong I live
all three of them the same but there's
just something there you know like I
feel like Porter soul and my soul are
connected I don't know that that seems
crazy but I've never felt that way about
any other dog we're soul mates
we really are and I thought it would be
really cute to name it Porter Miami kind
of like a play on words of Port of Miami
much of you didn't know Port of Miami is
just a seaport in Miami yes this one is
my second favorite in the entire
collection and honestly sometimes I feel
like it's a tie
sometimes but this is the color magic
city I can describe this as like a hot
copy red and this is actually not as
orange as some of you might think so
many of you guys are like oh for sure
she's coming out with a red orange for
summer you guys just know me so well
definitely red orange is like my
favorite color but this is more of like
a poppy red I wouldn't say it's red
orange when you swatch this color next
to a more orange toned red you could
definitely see the difference and I'm
actually surprised myself but I went
with the red like this instead of horns
Road
hot red nails are like my absolute
favorite and I named it Magic City
because it really does remind me of
Magic City the show I'm not sure if you
guys are familiar with that show that's
based in Miami around the 1950s after
the Cuban Revolution and I got canceled
after the second season but it was such
a great show Jeffrey Dean Morgan was the
main guy Ike Evans so dreamy and I
really loved it and Magic City is what
they call Miami which is why they named
that show that but anyway this polish
reminds me of Vera which is Ike Evans
wife in the show shake this is the color
she would wear and since they Miami
theme I just I wanted to call it Magic
City and I love the name of it I love
the shade there's a color I think a lot
of you are really going to like this one
is also a one KOTOR almost but
definitely I think needs to coat but
it's really opaque on the first coat
it's so vibrant and really intense this
next one is called Ocean Drive and for
summer I knew I wanted a nail polish
that was deep glittery and teal I wanted
a little bit of blue a little bit of
green and this is exactly what I had in
mind and I will say I struggled with
this shade a little bit because I didn't
want the glitter to be too chunky and I
have to keep sending back samples to get
the perfect amount of shimmery goodness
at the perfect opacity and I really
really love it I love how it shines in
the Sun I don't know the sunlight this
is incredible it looks so intense and
vibrant I really love this color and I
thought oh Sh in Drive was the perfect
name for it fun fact this nail polish
was actually named Coral Cove Marina for
a very long time which is actually the
marina Dexter used to like dump his body
then I believe in the show Dexter I'm
pretty sure he used to park his boat at
Coral Cove Marina at least in the
earlier seasons but I was afraid people
really wouldn't get it I thought they
would be like what the heck does that
have to do with Miami unless you were a
huge Dexter fan like me that is my
favorite drama of all time I thought
people just would get it I'm on with
Ocean Drive and now I actually like this
name a lot more and ocean drive is like
a lot of street for like a drive through
Miami Beach is a very popular place I
did want to mention with this color
though you have to use a really good
base coat with this because if not it
will stain your nails
I won't stain it like green but when you
go to remove it it is a little bit
harder to remove than any of the rest of
these polishes the other one
remove like a breeze this one is just a
little bit harder because of all that
glitter and that deep pigment okay next
up we have this guy right here this one
is south peach and this one I would
consider it
peach II like peachy but I wouldn't
consider it of peach I mean it is it is
peachy but when you put on the nails to
me it's more of like that creamsicle
shade like that delicious orange e PG
creamsicle yummy orange sorbet kind of
color it's a little bit more vibrant
than a peach is what I'm trying to get
at this one was very very hard to do I
went back and forth with this color so
long but I just loved it so much I kept
fighting for it others like this are
hard to do I don't know why but this one
is a little bit tricky when you're
painting your nails it is a to coder but
if you do very very thin coats I would
recommend three coats I'm someone who
does like thicker coats so I get away
with two and you don't see the bottom of
my nail at all but I know like my mom
does very very thin layers
every time she doesn't know polish so
for this she does three coats but it is
easy to work with so I love this color
so much especially if you have deeper
skin tones on me it's not my favorite
like when I put it on I'm like oh I like
it but I don't love it but like when
Amelia wears it I think it looks
beautiful or any like medium to deep
skin tone it looks beautiful or if
you're extremely fair this looks really
nice to say I love South peach and I
named it South peach I mean for obvious
reasons it's a little peachy and South
Beach is our like very famous beach here
in Miami I thought it was cute you know
how Beach South Beach okay so next up is
another major favorite of mine I want to
say this is my third favorite in the
group this is a shade m.i.a and it is an
intense hot pink with a very subtle blue
undertone if you look at the bottle I'm
not not sure you can tell but it has
this slight sheen to it barely
noticeable but it just makes the Polish
look really glossy when it's on your
nails and kind of shiny I will say
though you have to use a top coat with
this one because if not it dries down
almost with like a satin finish but when
you put your top coat on it no matter
what talked about you use this polish
looks so glossy and shiny and I would
consider this kind of like a jelly
formula where it's not as creamy as the
rest of them like these are 100% cream
polishes this one is a little bit of
like a jelly it's just like a little
this year kind of has like that juicy
look to it where it's not completely
solid and cannot wait to wear this color
so much in the summer and I named mi a
because mi a is like short for Miami
this color had like 10 different names
and I'm not sure if you noticed but in
my first collection I have a name which
is called Zoey and my second collection
I have a name it's it's the last name
but st. Claire is still name and I kind
of want to add a name in every
collection I don't know why it's just
the thing I want to do so I thought mi a
was perfect because it's still a Miami
collection but then it can moonlight as
Mia we won't tell anybody if your name
is Mia we'll pretend it's called me I
don't know I thought I had a double
meaning so I went with the name mi a a
lot of people were asking me it's a
stood for Miami International Airport
honestly to me it's just a shorter
version of Miami but it can be whatever
you want it to be and then last but
certainly not least is the color I am
wearing on my nails right now this is
the shade 305 and this is a lime green
you know what's weird is I felt like it
had so much yellow before but now
looking at in the bottom in my very room
or something I don't know it looks more
green on camera for some strange reason
but it does have a little bit of yellow
if you put this nail polish next to I
don't know this is my carrier but if you
put this next to a green nail polish you
can see the yellow in this one has a
little bit of both I love this color so
much it's not a neon but it is kind of
like a mutiny on it's kind of like a
poopy err version of a Neal I feel like
it's more wearable than like a hot green
yellow neon is what I'm trying to say
and I have a feeling this one's going to
be everyone's least favorite just
because I think it's the least wearable
out of all of them but that's why I love
it so much I feel like the more wearable
it is the more I want to wear it
something about wearing these ridiculous
nail polish colors that just makes me
happy
I love it my mom was actually wearing
this one yesterday and she loved it this
looks beautiful on deeper skin tones the
way I feel about South Beach is the same
way I feel about 305 throw a good on all
skin tones but they look the best on
deeper skin tones this is going to make
your skin tone just absolutely pop if
you have like a medium to deep skin tone
it's amazing and this one is a little
bit tricky - I'm wearing two coats right
now and they're completely covered with
two coats but like I said with South
speech if you're someone who does very
thin coats then I would suggest three
coats as well my office reco yesterday
and she said she did it with a breeze it
was no
problems but I mean I did two coats and
I did my nails on Wednesday so I get a
difference oh and I named it 3:05
because that is the area code in Miami
you know 305 okay so I quickly wanted to
show you guys because I get a lot of
questions on what inspires me to create
the shade I create and this pen tone
book really helps me like here this is
the page that helped me create - the
shade 305 so yeah I love this book it's
extremely helpful okay so yeah that
