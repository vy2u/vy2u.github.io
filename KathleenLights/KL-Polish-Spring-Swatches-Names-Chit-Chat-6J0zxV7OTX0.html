video is really exciting because we are
going to be talking all about the kale
polish spring collection the video that
went up yesterday was kind of like a
simple quick little commercial just to
kick off the launch but I wanted to do
an entire video dedicated to swatches
and just talking you guys all about the
spring collection I want to do this kind
of video every time I launch a new
collection so even though you couldn't
really see the colors that well and the
commercials and everything was just like
really really fast
this is the video where you'll get more
of a feel of all the colors what they
look like the names of the good stuff
and this video was actually supposed to
go up on Tuesday and I wanted to do that
because I wanted to post this the day
before it launched just so you can get
all this info before we launched but I
had a doctor's appointment on Monday and
when I got home from my doctor's
appointment I could not film so I had to
wait until today to film it and I know
that whenever I post the video either on
Tuesday or Thursday it's because the
video is sponsored like I always post my
sponsor videos on Tuesdays or Thursdays
so they don't interfere with my normal
video but turns out this video is not
sponsored unless unless I'm sponsoring
myself mmm
just kidding okay I'll publish did not
sponsor this video because I am Caleb
others and I know it's not going to
video but anyway okay let's get to why
you even click on this video we are here
to discuss my spring collection is so
crazy hosting them here in my can I'm
going to go through every single color
we're going to discuss the color and I'm
going to show you swatches before I get
into that if you want to mention these
colors are available right now and I
know earlier today we had like a glitch
on the website and it was telling people
the collection was sold out when it
wasn't like there were certain colors
that were showing up sold out for
certain people we have no idea why that
was happening boa fix it and things
aren't sold out at least when I am
currently filming this video nothing is
sold out yet I don't know if things are
going to be sold out by the time I post
this video but if anything is sells out
we will restore don't worry the spring
collection is permanent just like my
winter collection was permanent all
permanent so you can get them in a semi
like I will have any ko polish website
down below okay is that all I wanted
tell you guys they launched we had a
good thing with 16 this is a really free
vibration Darrell a periwinkle kind of
shade I love booths like this I knew
that for the spring line I wanted to
come out with like a Cinderella color
that was like vibrant and fun and I
loved it I think this is the color that
stands out the most in the collection
my eyes are automatically drawn to this
color when anyone in my family is
wearing it I just love it so so much and
I named this one st. Claire one of my
favorite books of all time is Emma and
the French kiss
it's a whi a novel if you've never read
it before and you're into Y novels I
definitely think you should read it it
is the cutest love story ever but it's
written really well I love the author
Stephanie Perkins and she created this
amazing main character in the book and
the guys name is Hannah st. Claire his
last name is st. Claire and for some
reason when I saw this shade in person
like while I was thinking of the name
st. Claire just popped into my head I
don't know I just feel like it's the
perfect name for this shade and I love
@pn Sinclair he is very dreamy for me I
felt like making spring colors was
harder than making winter shades there
is something about spring colors that's
kind of hard to get the perfect formula
pastels can sometimes be hard to work
with I wouldn't call this color or
pastel though but you know what I'm
saying so this one is completely opaque
on two coats but I definitely think you
need to coat I'm wearing two coats on my
hands right now and I will show you two
coats in the swatches I'm going to do
one coat and then you'll see how it
looks with one coat and then I'll add a
second coat I always do a second coat on
my nails no matter how thick it is I
don't know if it's just habit but I
always do two coats this is st. Claire
this next one is called coconut milk and
to me it's like exactly like coconut
milk it looks white in the bottle but
when you apply this to your nails it's
not white it's kind of like an off-white
with a milky consistency this one is a
little bit sheer but I love that look it
kind of reminds me of the perfect white
for a bride because it's not too white I
mean I guess that's the only way I could
describe it literally the consistency of
coconut milk this one is definitely a to
colder with one coat it is a little bit
too sheared you get that like milky look
with two coats I don't know it's so
beautiful I love it okay so I realized
that these coconut milk swatches are
pretty stupid cuz the nail thing itself
is white and you can't really see it but
I thought I would show you anyway
because you could kind of tell you know
compared to the other little nail strip
on the side that it is a little bit more
like an off-white you see you see you
can totally see that there right like
you can tell and I wanted to show you
this really quick this is a comparison
between coconut milk and another white
shade I'm working on for the future not
for sum or anything it's not going to
come off for a while but I just wanted
to show you coconut milk is on the right
and a regular stark white is on the left
so you can see the difference you know
it's not completely white okay so the
next one I wanted to show you is this
guy right here and I wanted to show you
in comparison to coconut milk because I
know in certain photos it might look
like this one is really similar to
coconut milk but they are really not at
all especially swatched in the bottle I
mean I guess but no no no this one is a
really pretty light light light light
lavender like a very white based
lavender I wouldn't consider this like a
typical lavender it does have like that
pastel look to it and in my opinion I
think it looks way better on the nails
than it does in the bottle - lavender
but I feel like there's a drop like a
tiny
of pink in there somewhere and this one
is called hug and roll and I got so many
questions about this shade hugging roll
is something from the show friends if
you guys don't already know I mean I'm
sure you do I mention it all the time
but friends is my favorite show of all
time that show got me through my parents
divorce test show is like everything to
me
and there's an episode where Ross is
teaching Chandler the famous hugs and
roll if you've seen that episode you
know what I'm talking about
and then you hug her and roll her over
to her side hug for her roll for you
okay the old hug and roll yeah and
honestly I don't know why I looked at
this color and I thought oh my gosh hug
and roll but I vent for some reason I
think this looks like a hug and roll
call me crazy but I do I don't know if
it's like lavender and like hugs I don't
know but I decided to name a hug girl
and I love this color
so next up we have the only color in the
collection that isn't a cream finish
cream finishes are honestly just my
favorite don't get me wrong I will
always venture out into different
finishes like this one this is like a
chrome metallic there's a bit of a
shimmery one coming out in the summer I
will have different finishes throughout
the year but cream colors are just
they're my thing this one is a really
pretty intense metallic chrome and it's
a pinky silver at first when you look at
it it kind of looks rose gold but it
looks more rolled silver on the nails
versus rose gold which is what I was
going for and they're all really long
wearing on me personally I mean
everybody's nails are different over me
my formula is long wearing and I just
wanted to state that in this video that
it's the exact same formula my formula
is not going to change I feel like I
have such a nice formula and I'm not
just saying that but I really do love my
formula and I'm not changing it I got a
lot of questions if this collection has
a different formula no it doesn't colors
are different some colors there's more
sheer some colors are a little bit more
pigmented it's just depending on the
color but formula wise the formula is so
exactly the same but for some reason
this one lasts like an extra long time
on me like for me sis doesn't come off
my nails it's crazy
anyway I named this one that's what she
said and I feel like people were so
confused when I revealed this shades
because I love playing that game with
you guys I want to do that every lunch I
want to show you guys a black and white
picture of the bottom of the bottle and
show you guys the names before I reveal
the colors just so you guys can guess
what color matches to what name I kinda
want to do that with you guys every
lunch and when I revealed that's what
she says people were like what I would
have never thought that was the color
and honestly I don't know I don't know
why this one is called that so she said
I don't know why but I knew I wanted a
reference from the office the office is
probably my second favorite comedy of
all time
as her friends doctors reason yeah and
this is such a pretty like pinky silver
like a girl like she so like that's what
she said I don't know sometimes the
names don't make sense I just wanted to
throw that out there sometimes names and
colors they don't match but it's just
what popped into my head
and I ran with it
this next one is such a pretty green I
don't even know how to describe this
color to me it kind of looks like a baby
olive like if the color olive could be
like a baby color could be like a pastel
baby color it would be this because it's
not a minty green it's not a baby green
it's kind of like a baby wallet it's
kind of like a light version of a dirty
green but now that's a dirty I really
don't know how to explain this and it's
so funny because this one is called
pistachio ice cream because when I was
sitting down and I was thinking about
the names of these nail polishes I
looked at this color I was like oh my
gosh you know what this reminds me of
pistachio ice cream and without even
confirming if it looks like pistachio
ice cream I just named it that and it
turns out that the derivative looks much
too like pistachio ice cream not really
but I don't know it reminds me of that
so that's that's what I'm calling it and
that's the name of it and I kind of like
the fact that it doesn't look like this
and I see
and last but certainly not least is this
baby right here this one I would
describe it as like a melon not a melon
but like a dusty melon yeah I would
describe it as like a dusty melon
because melon is like more orangie right
yeah melon is like more like vibrant
this is like a muted dusty pinky melon
and I decided to name this one Miss
Honey after Miss Honey from Matilda
Matilda was one of my favorite movies
growing up I had like three childhood
movies that I watched non-stop Matilda
The Little Rascals and The Parent Trap
Matilda was my life I wanted to be
Matilda when I was younger like I just
wanted to have powers like I remember
wanting a teacher just like Miss Honey
so badly and for some reason I feel like
this is the kind of nail polish she
would wear like am I crazy don't you
feel like Miss Honey wears this color if
you were Matilda fans like this is the
kind of coverage you would have on her
nails all the time it just it it reminds
me so much of her like this came to me
right away when I was creating this
color I was like oh my gosh this is such
a Miss honey color and this one is a
little bit more sheer than the other one
it's completely opaque in two coats it's
just a little milky er I don't know I
love it
I would consider her the most wearable
color out of the group well her and
coconut milk these two are the most
wearable like that I love all of them I
would love to know which color is your
favorite leave it down below out of all
sixes like which one is your favorite
but yeah I guess I complained this video
