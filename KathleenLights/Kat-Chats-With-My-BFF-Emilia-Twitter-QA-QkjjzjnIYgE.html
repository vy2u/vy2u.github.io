like one major fight not really I mean
we've had issues and like we go a couple
days without talking but then like we
get over it if you had to change one
thing about each other what would it be
okay if you could change one thing about
one thing about you when she's on her
phone 24/7 you're talking to her and she
does not listen you know 34 years old

bathroom oh no I had to pee really
really really bad I actually don't
remember how it happened or whatever but
a media had called me to the to the
kitchen and we were in her house and
when I look she's holding a cockroach by
like the antenna or whatever I don't
know why I have a serious fear of
cockroaches I hate coverages so when I
walk up to her I guess I didn't notice
what was in her hand I walk up turning
to the cockroach I flipped out of my
hand that I flicked it I want I flicked
it it went into Amelia's hair so when I
went up in maybe she's thirty freaking

of mind and I remember all the pistols
all over like I feel all over it was
pretty funny we just have like
late-night chats in her kitchen lots of
memorable moments we've had lots of
funny funny but I'm talking to like
funny moments oh my god immediate was
there the day that I had told my
grandmother okay
oh wait we were sitting down and we were
playing dominoes you know like it's like
a Cuban thing whatever and me and me
later on a team and then my grandmother
and my little cousin neesee were on a
team i also said this story once but Wow
while back and we were all playing
dominoes and I have linked to my
grandmother and she's had fake teeth for
as long as I can remember and I had told
I was like mom Yolanda oh I see and I
told him to do this I don't know why she
gave him to me but she didn't when she

have peed on myself probably from that
party for I did so much oh yeah I mean
yeah this thing we're like sure carts
but she's uncomfortable when I'm nervous
there is uncomfortable or being tickled
amazed I'm gonna say something we don't
take a leech other butt
just sitting I've seen her boyfriend's
tickle her and she's like farted in
front of my friends when they tickle her
and I've been in the room I'm like oh
Sinnott won't wait don't know what you
know what I've always warned them though
like don't tickle me I know what I'm
telling them cookies there you go did I
mean you ever find it weird awkward that
you were dating her brother okay that
makes my newsroom wonderful
so I met Danny my husband who I've been
married to for five years now Danny I
met him through Amelia
Danny's mother at one point in life for
a lot of years like for a long time was
married to a media's father so Amelia
and Danny were already born a lot of
people think they're like related
through blood but they're not there were
like step brother and sister but they
grew up together you know like they
refer to each other as brother and
sister so that is how I met Danny
because like I loved Danny when I was
little I was like mmm
but I've always wanted to happen yeah it
was never a party it was never awkward
for me I knew that that was gonna happen
and I was like it's got what's the most
embarrassing thing that happened with
you guys
what's the one thing you both admire
about each other attend to the first
question first what's the most
embarrassing thing that happened with
you guys I know what's the most
embarrassing thing that's happened with
me a hundred times yep
with what do you talk about the day that
girl ran me over oh I would never forget
about that bro
hey you didn't help me up at all I was
outside in middle oh my god oh so funny
Rhodes just I was it was just like I
don't know where I was
we were outside in the courtyard and we
were standing he knows me Emilia some
kid named Jason whatever we were sitting
there and all of a sudden this girl's
charging in my direction I'm like I know
she didn't hurry to go somewhere I don't
know she looks that she's gonna have
open to me what but she it was happened
so far she slammed right into me and
just kept running my legs went into the
air oh my god that's my my legs went in
the gyros I want you not enough of them
Oh an ear like that like I'm in Jason
had to go up to me and was like oh my
god are you okay man yeah fine I'm fine
Anna media in a corner cracking up
literally like me losing over air
cracking up so hard that was really
embarrassing for me you haven't think
amazing things don't happen to you
unfortunately no the only thing that I
really like I don't know it's changed
but they like if you know you see like a
little white lie because if your bed and
you're like I would look her and all the
time like right and she's like what are
you talking about like what Emilia is
trying to say she's drunk if you can't
understand her but I mean Ian's trying
to say is a lot of the times but a lot
of the times you don't tell me
beforehand I wasn't married I have to be
prepared how's the two PC you have to be
at iHome girl immediately will say
something like if somebody had to do
something in their media we're gonna go
sorry Academy and Kathleen have to go to
the mall tomorrow that's what I'm saying
man but but now I'm like I'm saying it
and it doesn't sound right just oh yeah
I don't do it on purpose I was just like
wait a minute I we made plans to go to
the mall tomorrow like if I had forgot
it but no now I'm now I'm on track it I
thought doesn't happen anymore the adult
does the adult Catholic doesn't I feel
like I'm all ready to see what is the
weirdest thing you guys have ever done
together we don't do anything weird
because there's ghosts scared of
everything that's very true
yeah we haven't done anything good an
answer the other second question oh we
did what's the one thing you both admire
about each other I can literally ask her
anything
and I can trust what she tells me cannot
explain it like you know when you ask
somebody for advice you're like oh no
you know that's who like really trust
that but her I know that go up to her
and I tell her what's going on and I ask
for advice
I know what a lot of times she does not
like what I tell her but I still like
the fact that she tells me even though
it doesn't matter if I get mad or if I
don't like it but I need to hear that
because I don't like people to just tell
me things just to make me feel better
that's not yeah even it's hard but it's
not I'm not I don't like that but you're
like that - you like that - I mean who
nobody likes for them to be told
something that they don't
here but I guess I admire lots of things
about a media but what I what I remember
the most is okay I have issues and I
know that I have issues like I have a
lot of anxiety problems I have like a
lot of fear of life okay a lot of people
don't know this but when I started
driving and Danny was on deployment
I used to pick up Amelia at her house
every time I had to pump gas and then we
would drive to a gas station and
immediat would pump gas room because I
was I'm still to this day terrified of
gas stations like I don't like it and
there were so many people who would tell
her like you can't do that
you have to like force her to go to the
gas station like let her let her just be
a free bird you know you can't he's like
now you know she's scared so I feel bad
whatever media has always been there to
like um since I got my bail when you
ever bailed on us out I mean they're
just like oh my god
like you know that she would pick there
was this one time where we were farm a
Janine her boyfriend we all went to like
laser tag
do you remember nothing then we went to
go play laser tag you were freaking out
when I got there had like a major panic
attack and I was like I have to go I
have to leave I have to leave and Janine
was like what the hell do you mean you
have to leave like I'm not even I drove
here girl you're stuck you're screwed
and I remember calling a media and I'm
like a media please please please come
pick me up you know whatever and it was
a far far place and I mean I went and
picked me up even though it was far
like you know she's uh yeah pinky Thank
You girl got my back little broke hmm
that's about me this cool for Christmas
say I admire that even though she might
not agree maybe yeah maybe I should put
a pump my own gas but you know oh this
one's a go to do have you an immediate
ever like to had feelings for the same
guy yes I love you I love you too my
Ella oh my god man huh I'm sorry I love
him anybody ever had feelings for the
same guy okay well I'm gonna let you
onto this one huh oh my god yes what do

one time and it was actually my
ex-boyfriend that I was with for a while
name was William but before but
for them yeah okay cuz immediate I had
taken I was dancing my friend Malins

guys that were dancing that was dancing
there and I had never met Lydia before
but one day I brought in me to like the
practices with me she wasn't dancing
them but she was there and she went to
like a couple of them we would hang out
there and like for some reason I think
yeah it was a crush you know I think it
was just a crush because he does have
them yeah he's like Mendenhall's her
dancing yeah so he was a good dancer and
like I guess she would like watch him
practice or super deveneux and then like
so did I it was a little weird but one
but when I told the media like oh my god
you know like William likes me this and
the media's like Algar like yeah I'm
over it I'm over it once the fifties
were over she was like yeah I'm over it
on to the next one I would never cross
those boundaries anyway like we put in
Anna
we used to want to make something in
tradition was like that Bernie shadow

to like burn our ex-boyfriend stuff in
the fire pit
yeah like once a year I think every
friend has done yeah yeah we don't
really have tradition oh you know what
December 31st we would put like what we
wished for oh yeah we were right and we
put it in a special box and we both got
like we each got usually ha ha no idea

write like something we wanted and then
we would put it in our box and then we
wouldn't read it to like the following

annoying huh say that language-arts glad
I was pretty annoying I'm surprised we
were friends at that age any inside
jokes we have so many inside jokes
that's up
am i right it's out here huh
I feel like inside jokes are not
something you can explain God again even
when you explain the story you're like
oh that's not funny I know that you
probably got like cootie good dream
another one oh yeah yeah good do it do
it do it we know don't you want me baby
no girl good times good times what is
one thing you guys experienced together
that made you guys realize how much you
mean to each other how to do things
Angie no that's my first I would say
with my cousin passed like she passed
really young at a young age and I was
like you can really go anytime so it's
like I don't know like that and she was
there for me also and it was like a
really hard time for me that was it even
for me when she passed she it was
actually like my mom got the phone call
from a media's mom and then when I
overheard it like on the phone call like
I broke down and I was just horrible and
then I had never really seen in that
side of the media before so we're like
when I showed up you know to the place
where the enemy did just like hug that
we cried and we cried and we cried you
know it's always good to have somebody
at least like that in your life that was
a moment that I feel like it was also
for me as well
yeah it was honestly like that was
another person I trusted what is the
other thing we realized what other
moment so a recent relationship oh my
recent relationship you know since there
was a lot of things going she did not
agree with any no I was just very
conflicting and I just didn't want to be
like I distance myself from her because
I know that how she felt with the guy
was with that I was in a bubble I was in
that love bubble and I'm sure that some
girls I've gone through this get advice
to get advice and you just do what you
want at the end of the day there were
things that were happening it's true it
they say like love really is blind and
when you feel like very strongly about
somebody it doesn't matter what anybody
tells you you're gonna go with your
heart you're gonna go with what you
think is right yeah there was there was
a situation that happens that every
captain really out of it wait a minute
wait wait member what am I doing with my
life so yeah but now we know she's in a
good place everything is great who has
the most chances of being drunk at 3:00

questions telling me you find any of
your obsessions what does it mean if I
