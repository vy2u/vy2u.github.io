Jessie's Girl Liquid Liner</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2014-09-22</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLwvx1Je5Zk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">hey guys so today's video is going to be
kind of like a battle of the brands kind
of video I actually haven't done a video
like this on my channel before I don't
think but I'm basically going to be
taking a high-end product and comparing
it to a drugstore product that pretty
much claims to do the exact same thing
and we're going to see which one is
better and the reason why I came up with
this video is because I recently
purchased the Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper and then a couple weeks later I
purchased the Jessie girls liquid
eyeliner and I was like this is very
very similar and it's literally less
than half the price so that's what I am
doing today and I am putting them to the
test and I'm going to be comparing these
two products actually have a demo of me
applying this one to this eye and
applying this one to this eye which I
will get into in a second but really
quickly I just want to talk about them
the reason why I'm comparing these two
as opposed to so many other different
drugstore liquid liners is because I
feel like the tip is so so similar most
liquid liners that come in the pen form
like this usually have a felt tip both
of these have a brush tip which is
really what intrigued me into buying the
Kat Von D tattoo liner in the first
place is the fact that it was a brush
tip applicator and not a felt tip feel
like brush tips are a little bit easier
to work with and you get a more steady
line and I really love brush tips and
then when I purchase the Jessie's Girl
one I didn't know that it wasn't felt
tip and when I got it in the mail I was
like oh my gosh it's a brush tip I
realized that the tip was pretty much
exactly the same and then suddenly the
Kat Von D one wasn't that special so I
wanted to put them both to test today
and I'm going to be wearing them
throughout the entire day and at the end
of the night I will come back and we
will kind of see which winged eyeliner
held up better because if the Jessie's
girl lasts just as long as the Kat Von D
one I probably will not repurchase the
Kat Von D one anymore because the
Jessie's Girl is $6.99 and this one is
$18 even the packaging is the same they
the difference is this is really shiny
and silver and this is like a matte
black packaging but they pretty much are
the same size and have the similar
little packaging it's so crazy how
similar they are I know that there's
another liquid liner by Physicians
Formula that also has a brush tip that
is very similar to these but I believe
that one is like twelve or thirteen
dollars I'm not exactly sure this one
again is much cheaper than that one as
well by the way you can find Jessie's
Girl cosmetics at Rite Aid or at
Jessie's Girl cosmetics calm which is
where I bought this one by the way I
will say I'm not exactly sure if this is
cheating or not but the Jessie's Girl
one does claim to be waterproof when the
Kat Von D does not so that can be a
major issue to some people some people
don't like waterproof liquid eyeliners I
don't see why anybody wouldn't because
waterproof tends to stay on a lot longer
do take that into consideration this one
doesn't claim to be waterproof when this
one does but we're still going to try it
out because I find that the Kat Von D
one does last a pretty good time anyway
as for how much product comes in these
little suckers the Kat Von D one has
point zero two fluid ounces and the
Jessie's Girl has point zero one seven
fluid ounces so the Kat Von D one does
have a little bit more but for the price
if this one is better
I would definitely go with this one
we'll see I don't know so I'm going to
quickly go ahead and show you guys the
demo of me applying the Jessie's Girl
one on my left eye and then the Kat Von
D tattoo liner on my right eye
you
so I applied the Jessie's Girl eyeliner
to this eye right here as you can see it
is so so black like it is really really
pigmented like that is a black line
what's great about the Jessie's Girl one
is that it didn't have to go back into
the bottle or like the tube shake it up
and apply it again it didn't dry out
while I was doing my I so love this
eyeliner this is just a closer look and
then this is the eye I applied my Kat
Von D tattoo liner with this is in the
shade trooper by the way I don't know if
I mentioned that the Jessie's Girl only
comes in one color I'm not exactly sure
how many colors this one comes in but we
talked about trooper today I was kind of
trying to stay in frame so you guys can
see me applying it that I kind of messed
up with it so let's let's ignore that
again also very very black and very very
pigmented this is the Kat Von D right
here super easy to apply and this is a
closer look of this eyeliner even though
it's a little funky and crooked okay so
I had a little bit of trouble applying
the Kat Von D one on this side because I
always do it's really difficult for me
to apply eyeliner on my right eye always
all the time but as for how they applied
they apply so similar is just pretty
much holding the exact same thing okay
so I will wear these for the rest of the
day and then I will check back in with
you guys at the end of the night and we
will see who won the battle of the brand
hey guys it is now 7:45 almost 8 o'clock
at night I realized that earlier today I
didn't tell you what time it was but I
started filming this video at like 2:00
in the afternoon that's usually the time
that I sit down in film and the
eyeliners look great so I've had the
eyeliners on for almost six hours which
isn't a very long time I know but I
figured it was a good enough time but
anyway they both look absolutely great
they pretty much look exactly the same
as they did when I applied them now keep
in mind I was home all day
I wasn't like working out or running in
the rain or anything like that
so I can't really tell you that this
will last all day at school if you're
like rubbing your eyes and really sleepy
and all that stuff
but they look good the Kat Von D one
looks exactly the same as it did when I
applied that but that was to be expected
with the Kat Von D I've heard so many
good things that it lasts all day and
that it does not budge and I agree it
doesn't it looks really great it's still
super super black super matte and
perfect while the wing doesn't look
perfect the wing looks a little bit huh
but you know I am so impressed honestly
with the Jessie's girl liquid eyeliner
because just like the Kat Von D it looks
exactly the same as it did when I
applied it no sponginess it hasn't faded
some liquid eyeliners I've noticed that
throughout the day it'll turn kind of
gray or my skin will start peeking
through the eyelid you know what I'm
saying that happens to me a lot and that
didn't happen with this one it stayed
intact also keep in mind that I have dry
skin so I have dry eyelids I don't have
oily eyelids so I do not know how this
would work on oily eyelids mine are
pretty dry so via overall I do have to
say that I love them both equally I
think they're both equally good so in
terms of who won this battle I'm going
to have to go ahead and give it to the
Jessie's girl one only because it is $11
cheaper than they kept on day one even
though this one has a little bit more
product with the price of the Kat Von D
one you can go ahead and buy two of
these and then they'll last longer
because it's two of them okay guys so
that wraps up this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you like these kind of
