a whole review and swatches on Kylie
cosmetics Kylie Jenner's makeup brand I
have had so many requests to do this
video and I know I'm like super late to
this video thousand other people already
have a video just like this but it's
just been so so so so so requested that
I thought I should do it and everyone's
opinion is different so if you're
interested in knowing my opinion of the
brand then this is it I'm gonna be
talking about the kyoto palette her
eyeliners the pencils and the pots her
matte liquid lipsticks her glosses and
then a couple of her metallic ones I'm
also gonna be talking about her lip
liners as well because I have some of
those the whole shebang I don't have
everything some of these items were sent
to me some of these I purchased myself
something you guys care about that
because you know that my opinion is not
swayed based on if it was sent to me for
free or not if you want to see specific
reviews like if you don't care about the
lip stuff you want to see the cash a doe
palette only like if you want to get to
the actual part of the video you really
want to see I will have timestamps in
the description box I almost feel like I
should have waited before filming this
video because I know she's releasing
like four or five new lip kits there's
like a green one and then a ton of other
beautiful colors that I definitely want
to get my hands on
but her stuff sells out so fast I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to get my
hands on it I don't know if it's gonna
be sent to me because sometimes things
aren't and some I just don't know so I
decided to just sit down and film this
video today so I am gonna start with the
lip products just because I feel like
that is what her brand is known for and
while I'm reviewing each individual
color I will insert lip swatches as well
because I know you guys like that so I'm
gonna start off with the Kylie glosses I
have four of them I'm not exactly sure
how many she has in her line but I have
oh and the first one I want to swatch is
called so cute and this one is my
favorite really quickly I want to touch
base on the packaging I freaking love
the Kylie Jenner packaging I think it's
really cool I really like the drips I
think the whole packaging whether you
like Kylie Jenner or not I think the
packaging is pretty freakin cool I don't
love the wand on the lip glosses I know
that there was a huge scandal because so
many people got like messed up wands but
luckily she did fix that I'm just still
not a huge fan of the brush style wand
Natacha Sedona has amazing lip glosses
with that one
and it's not my favorite I prefer a doe
foot applicator but because these losses
are so so pigmented I think that's why
they use that wand this color is my
favorite
these glosses kind of threw me off at
first I'm not going to lie when I first
started applying them it was so much
pigment I was kind of turned off by that
because I'm someone who really likes a
glossy finish are the ones that have
enough pigmentation where you can use
them on their own but I like them a
little bit sheer to where they top off a
lipstick really really nicely these I
feel are the type of lip glosses you're
going to want to wear just on their own
now if you put on a lipstick and then
you put on just a light layer of these
glosses it won't be too bad I still like
them I really do I just have a few other
lip glosses in my collection that I do
prefer I don't think they're sticky
either they're not uncomfortable to wear
they just goop up a little bit on the
inner corners these glasses would also
work really well if you just add a
little bit of lip liner fill in your
lips and then add a little bit of this
on top I think it's nice anyway enough
about that
that is just my opinion on these glasses
let me show you the other colors on my
lips so cute though is definitely my
favorite shade I just love the undertone
I think it is like the perfect nude next
up we have exposed this is a very very
warm almost brown lip gloss but I would
still categorize this as a nude on my
skin tone I think this color is unique
it's really nice I don't really have any
other gloss that is this color and it
does look really pretty on the lips
these do last a pretty good time they're
not one of those lip glosses that fade
right away another thing I would say I
don't necessarily love about these the
fact that they are so pigmented it's
kind of hard to just slap them on and go
what I love so much about lip glosses is
that you can apply them without a mirror
you know like without even thinking
about it you just put it on your lips
with these I can't really do that I
don't know I just think it's like too
much but I mean it just depends on
personal preference it all depends on
how you like to wear your gloss we all
like different glosses for different
reasons you know this next one is coke
okay and I really really like this one
too I just think it's so feminine and
soft and I love that it has that little
shine to them if you want a super super
long wearing glossy lip this paired with
coke okay matte liquid lipstick is
awesome like it literally lasts all day
and I just really really really really
love
color and then the last one I have is
candy kay it's the same color as her
matte liquid lipstick in candy kay I
don't know why but for some reason I'm
not a huge fan of the candy K colors the
liquid lipstick and the gloss and it has
nothing to do with formula it's just the
color for some reason doesn't call my
name and I feel like it's one of her
most popular colors it looks so
beautiful on everyone else but on me
like I don't love it I don't know what
yes those are the kylie glosses and I
would give them probably like a C rating
okay so now I want to talk about the two
metal matte lipsticks these are just
like her liquid lipsticks only they have
a metallic finish to them I'm actually
wearing air right now on top of her a
dirty peach lip liner so I have a
love-hate relationship with these I love
the colors I think they're so unique
both of them this is kind majesty and
this one is air like I said they're so
stunning they are beautiful but the
formula throws me off just a little bit
I love the fact that they dry down they
don't stay weird or goofy but they are
just a little bit patchy like when I'm
applying these I'll notice that in
certain spots on my lips it looks really
really metallic then on other spots of
my lips you could really see my lip
through it like it looks patchy and
uneven but I find that to be the case
with a lot of metallic lipsticks it must
be really really hard to create a
metallic lip that dries completely matte
because there's some inconsistencies
with a ton of brands when it comes to
metallic lips and these just don't look
the most flattering on the lips but I
really love them because I love the
color like I love air I think it's so
pretty and it worn in a couple times I
just have to really work with it to make
it work yeah I mean I also like that
they don't feel drying on the lips like
at all to me I feel like the metallic
lips feel even smoother than the other
ones but I mean I don't know I really I
don't know how to feel okay so now let's
move on to her matte liquid lipsticks I
have ten colors to share with you I
don't have all of her liquid lipsticks
like I said I also have a few lip liners
that I will be discussing as well so the
first lip kit I'm going to be talking
about is dirty peach I have the lip
liner and I have the liquid lipstick if
I do have the matching lip liner I will
show you in the lip swatches me applying
the lip liner first and then the liquid
lipstick on top just so you can see how
they both apply I wore the dirty peach
liquid lipstick the other day in a
makeup tutorial and it was a
semaa had tried it on and it was super
neon it looks like a very soft peach in
the packaging but for some reason like
at least on my lips it's very peach it's
like beach but with the dirty peach lip
liner underneath it kind of tones down
the jnanis most of her lip liners match
perfectly to the liquid lipstick but
this one is different the dirty peach
lip liner is a little bit deeper a
little bit more of that dirty looking
peach while the liquid lipstick is a
little bit more out there and peachy so
I love this lip liner like I said it's
what I'm wearing underneath air and I
definitely see myself using this lip
liner all the time a formula of these
lip liners kind of remind me of the
color pop ones in the sense that they're
very creamy and really easy to apply so
if you are looking for an alternative to
these because these are pretty pricey I
would definitely look to color pop and
as for the matte liquid lipsticks a lot
of you guys have been asking me my
opinion and I like it I do like the
formula I have to be completely honest
I'm not extremely picky when it comes to
liquid lipsticks I don't mind a dry
liquid lip as long as it doesn't crumble
off when things get so dry that they
become like little balls and like fall
off your face and onto your chin that's
what I don't like I don't have that with
any of these liquid lipsticks I don't
get that crumble enos now of course
everyone is different that's just my
personal experience and I also don't
think that they're identical to the
color pop formula I know a lot of people
say that they're exact dupes the color
pop ones are a little bit more drying
than these I don't know if she changed
the formula I don't know how her old
formula was I'm not sure but there's a
little bit more moisture to these versus
the color pop ones just like a little
bit okay so let's talk about my favorite
one out of all of them this is exposed I
even spoke about this in my monthly
favorites video I love this color I
don't have a liquid lipstick that looks
anything like this at least I don't
think I do I might but I love this like
really warm Brown nude on me it is
darker than what it looks in the tube
that's the case for a lot of these but
I've seen this look so light on everyone
but it pulls a little bit dark on me
I've worn this one all day and I've
never had any problems with it crackling
or crumbling they can feel a little bit
drying but it's nothing that's too bad
next up is brown sugar
and I love love this one I have the
matching lip liner as well this is just
a stunning brown color on me it is a
little bit darker than how it looks on
so many people and I just love this
shade for fall it is one of her newer
colors not like super brand new but I
think it's perfect for this time of year
it screams fall to me like I love these
kinds of Browns for the fall time I
definitely see myself wearing this shade
of ton next up is coke okay this is one
of her like original colors this is the
color that as soon as I saw it I was
like oh my gosh I think I might buy
Kylie cosmetics because before this
color I wasn't like super impressed with
the other ones eye candy K didn't really
scream my name oh another con about err
is that if it's on to your lips too long
it will kind of create like a little
weird rim on the inside also don't love
that about here I don't know but anyway
it's so pretty because I feel like it's
the kind of color that looks great with
so many different eye looks but it still
stands out on your lips it's not a nude
but it's not a super bold in-your-face
color either
it's the perfect everyday shade that has
a little bit of purple a little bit of
mom a little bit of pink and I think it
looks good on so many different people
as well next up is Kandy K this is one
of my least favorite colors I don't know
what it is like I said it's just not my
favorite I don't know how to explain it
I don't really love it on me but it does
look so pretty on so many different
people and I've heard tons and tons of
people rave about this color so yes that
is Kandy K next up is another favorite
of mine it is ginger one of her newer
colors I love this color it kind of
reminds me of a Nastasia Beverly Hill
Aston I could be completely wrong maybe
they're completely different colors but
in my mind when I look at it it reminds
me of Ashton which Ashton is probably my
all-time favorite abh liquid lipstick
ever this is the epitome of a Kathleen
fall shade I love colors like this in
the fall it has a warm undertone which I
really love I prefer this trend over
like the mauve trend personally I really
really love love love this color I think
she does such a great job of coming up
with colors I will say there's some
colors I'm not impressed with but most
of them I really really like next up is
Kristen and I have the matching lip
liner as well this one is also really
really beautiful I mean there's nothing
much to say about it I've already told
you what I feel about the formula but I
love
this color as well I think it's so
pretty and I think that this would look
so nice on everyone literally every
single person I think would look so
beautiful in Kristen I just think it's a
really nice flattering color and this is
definitely something that I'm going to
be gravitating towards a lot this fall
and winter and I also really like the
lip liner as well I didn't have any
issues with formula next up is Posie K
and I think there was like an article
somewhere I think it was like Perez
Hilton or something like that where they
said Lumiere 2 was a dupe for Posie K I
got really really excited when I read
that by the way I was like oh my gosh
they're talking about Lumiere 2 and I
was so excited I personally don't think
they are exact dupes of one another
Lumiere 2 pulls very very purple on my
lips while this one is a little bit more
on the pinky side this definitely has a
purple tone to it don't get me wrong but
I don't think it's as purple as Lumiere
to fill a stunning stunning stunning
color so wearable next up is love bite
and I have the matching lip liner as
well I don't love the lip liner of love
by I have to say I think it's because
it's a darker color I didn't have a
problem with any of the other lip liners
but this one is a little bit patchy on
my lips actually like a lot a bit patchy
on my lips I don't love the lip liner I
would just go ahead and skip on this
honestly I have so many dark lip liners
in my collection that aren't patchy one
of my favorite things to do is to grab a
lip liner and fill in my entire lips
with it and just run out the door
without a lip gloss without a lipstick
on top just pure lip liner it can be a
little bit drying but I find that that
lasts so long lip liners last forever on
your lips so I love using them alone
this is one of those colors that I
cannot use on its own because it's just
too patchy and I did I don't don't I
just don't like the lip liner but I do
like the liquid lipstick and love bite
it's kind of like a dirty purple I
really really love the color of this I
love the undertone and I just I love
this shade this is another color that
would look so nice
on everyone like on everyone I love it
and then the last color I have to talk
about is the shade freedom it's a dark
kind of Navy royal blue I have the
matching lip liner as well and I have to
say that I don't like this lip liner
when you apply it and you try to rub
your lips together it kind of transfers
like it'll take off lip liner on your
top lip and then transfer it to the
bottom lip so weird it was kind of throw
me off I don't like it when lipliners do
that and this lip liner does that it was
incredibly patchy so hard to work with I
don't know if it's because it's blue but
it was harder to make or something I'm
not exactly sure but I really did not
like this lip liner and the liquid
lipstick and freedom is okay if I'm
enemy completely honest I prefer the
blue from Too Faced they have liquid
lipsticks as well and they have a really
pretty dark blue I did a tutorial using
it I prefer that blue over this one this
one is a little weird I feel like on my
lips it doesn't dry completely 100%
matte like the other ones do okay so we
are done with the liquid lipsticks I'm
sorry that portion of the video was so
long I'm gonna quickly run through
everything else I want to talk about the
high shadow palette really quick this is
the bronze edition I'm not sure if she's
gonna come out with like a smoky one
soon or something like that but this one
is the bronze palette this retails for
$42 which it is pretty pricey but you
are getting nine eyeshadows so if you do
the math it's not terrible I like this
palette I actually think it's pretty
freakin good I'm wearing it on my eyes
today these are the only shadows on my
eyes right now and I really really like
the quality specifically of the matte
eyeshadows I think the matte eyeshadows
are awesome they blend really really
well I didn't have any problems with
patchiness nothing the shimmer shades
are not the best I have morphe shimmer
eyeshadows that are better than these
and morphe is like half the price but
with that being said there are only two
shimmer shades in the palette so you
know the good ones are the matte ones
and most of this palette is matte
I'm wearing this shade on my lid right
now which is a shimmery one and it just
didn't pack as much punch as I wanted it
to same goes with this shimmer shade but
I really do love the matte shades I'm
not gonna lie I also really love that
she has kind of like a matte light bone
color and a matte black shade I think
every palette needs a light matte color
and then a black matte color no matter
what palette it is and I know a lot of
people were thinking like I have a
million bone colors in my collection I
have a million black eyeshadows in my
collection but what I'm taking one
palette to go with me I want those
shades in my palette so I really really
appreciate that I think the packaging is
pretty cool
and I actually like that there's no
merit to this personally I like
cardboard packaging without a mirror if
it's a plastic packaging
are like a metal packaging or something
at that then yes I prefer a mirror I
rather you put a mirror in there but
when it's cardboard I prefer no mirror
just because like this is my two-faced
coke kongregate I'm look a broken mirror
every time I have cardboard packaging
and there's a mirror in it I freakin
break it I don't know what it is
maybe I'm too rough and I don't know but
I don't mind that there's no mirror I
always use my own separate mirror anyway
so yeah I forgot to tell you I would
give the liquid lipsticks kind of like a
be the cash a dough palette I would give
it also kind of I would give it like a
c-plus I would give it like a be like a
solid B maybe a B - because I won't love
the shimmer shades finally the last
thing we'll be talking about are her gel
pot eyeliners and then her pencil
eyeliners I have the shade of brown and
I also have the shade black - very basic
colors were very essential colors I will
say that really quickly that I really
love the packaging I love how she wrote
Kylie all over the top and it says like
Kylie on the side I think the packaging
is really cute and I love the cap I am
wearing this on my eyes right now this
is the winged eyeliner I did I used the
brown one just to give it a little bit
of a different twist and I'm not a huge
fan of the pot I think it is a little
bit drying a little bit hard to work
with it's not patchy or anything but I
feel like I have to tug at my eyes to
get a smooth application she also sells
an eyeliner brush that I ended up giving
away to a friend because I didn't really
like it it was kind of too thick for me
I prefer an angled eyeliner brush that's
very very very thin that one wasn't as
thin as I would like it to be but it's
not bad I I don't hate this I just think
it could be a little bit creamier maybe
with a little bit of duraline from
Inglot so that would really make a huge
difference that's probably what I'm
going to end up doing to this and then
the same goes with the black one it's
just a little bit too drying for me
these aren't the best I prefer my
Maybelline liquid eyeliner that's in a
pot like this or the Inglot one that one
is so creamy and so easy to apply and
after using the Inglot one consecutively
and then using this black one it was
like whoa whoa that's a that's different
the eyeliners are pretty good I really
like them I'm wearing the black one on
my waterline today and they're very very
creamy they glide on really easily
really similar to the color pop ones
personally I think that the color pop
ones
a little bit better I find that the
colour-pop eyeliners last longer on my
waterline than these do but yes unlike
the pots these are not drying at all I
really really like these and I will
definitely continue to use them but yeah
so that completes this video I'm sorry
it was so long but you know there was a
lot of information I wanted to give out
these were just my opinions on products
from Kylie cosmetics today I hope you
