another foundation where tests last
first impressions I'm gonna be wearing
the new la girl Pro matte HD long wear
matte foundation this is a ten dollar
foundation you can get it on the Ellen
girl website or anywhere they sell la
girl and you do get one full fluid ounce
in this foundation I really love the
packaging it looks a little bit more
luxurious than I'm used to from la girl
it's a nice frosted glass bottle you
have a pump I just really like the
finish of this I think it looks more
expensive than it is so I also have a
cold I feel like it's getting worse by
the day I came out to breathe my nose is
so stuffy but the show must go on
so I know what a lot of you guys are
thinking right now why would you try out
a matte foundation if you have dry skin
you're probably not gonna like that and
yes I know but it was highly requested
and there are a few men combinations I
really like because there's a difference
between Matt and like Matt on the
website it says it has a soft suede like
finish I'm into that and that it will
keep you shine free all day long creamy
liquid formula provides smooth and
buildable coverage minimize the
appearance of pores and fine lines for
an even soft focus effect huh we shall
see about that and it has vitamin E b5
and sunflower oil okay
I'm excited so the color selection with
this foundation isn't the absolute best
I find this to be the case with a lot of
drugstore foundations so I'm gonna have
to mix two today hopefully you can find
your shade if you're looking into this
foundation medium beige is just a little
bit too pink for me and then my tennis
too dark for me so I'm just gonna mix
these two together see if that works but
first I'm going to prime the skin pick
up my hair in premise again I'm gonna go
in with my tried-and-true Becca first
like priming filter it so super gloomy
the outside and I feel like my lighting
is really weird so please bear with me
oh my gosh I'm gonna be rubbing my nose
so much throughout the day today it's
gonna come right off my nose alright so
you know the drill I'm gonna do half my
face with a brush half my face with a
sponge I'm gonna mix both of these on
the back of my hand yeah it definitely
yeah yeah light tan is pretty dark so
I'm gonna put more of the medium beige
since it seems to be the right color
it's just the undertone is a little bit
off so this is gonna look too dark for
me
oh my gosh this is totally overlooked at
artery ah damn
I suck at color-matching hold on let me
add more can you tell this is a first
impression huh let me tell you I just
applied a lot of this and it's blending
out really nicely it looks more natural
than I would say like kinda like a satin
finish the website said suede like and
it kind of does look suede like oh my
god
I'm like totally getting some on this
side oopsie I really like how its
applied with a brush surprisingly I
thought because it was a matte
foundation I was just gonna prefer the
sponge but oh my gosh I think I like it
I'm just gonna drag this down my neck
because I messed up like really bad like
look at that what is that I'm gonna take
my flower Beauty sponge and use that on
this side whoa I applied a lot there oh
god I hate putting foundation on my neck
I like how it looks on both sides this
finish is so nice okay so besides the
color being completely wrong I think
this finish is so pretty I'm gonna zoom
you in and I'm gonna show you both sides
look really nice so this is my skin this
side is with the sponge yeah this side
with the brush dude I love how this
looks like I love this finish on my skin
oh my god and it doesn't feel tacky at
all and it hasn't started to sink into
my lines just yeah I mean it did just a
little bit but it's not terrible and my
forehead lines don't look so bad either
yesterday I was wearing that Dior under
cover foundation cuz I've been testing
that out and it's good it lasts a long
time but it sinks right into my fine
lines like immediately so wow I'm so
impressed like initially like I'm look I
love this I know I just put it on so I
don't want to jump the gun but this
looks so pretty it looks like my skin
and it's not tacky at all so I got
rubbed it down my neck and I
hate it you know my company this is a
ten dollar foundation and I already like
it way more than the Marc Jacobs
shameless foundation I turnout last time
but I really want to try it out the way
that Katie tried it like drenching it in
setting spray maybe that'll work but
that suspense it and this is so cheap
ten dollars and it looks so pretty I am
so impressed so far so yes I'm just
gonna go ahead and finish up the rest of
my face makeup and I'm actually just
gonna quickly do it here on camera and
show you guys I'm gonna speed through
this entire part but there are a few
products I haven't tried out just yet
and I kind of want to throw them in this
first impressions for example this is
the new bare minerals Gen nude blush and
this in the shade that peach though lend
a peach though and I really really
wanted to sell look how pretty that
color is I have this I have the new
August hacia bronzer which I've already
tried and I really really like it but I
don't think you guys have seen me apply
it I also got the new Anastacio soft
glam palette I'm gonna use it today on
my eyes I have the new a benefit bag out
bang mascara that I really want to put
to the test so I'm gonna be wearing this
all day as well all right I'm gonna give
you one quick look on my skin now that
it's completely settled and dried and
then I will move on with the rest of my
makeup
okay so that's pretty much I'm gonna do
with the eyes I wanted to do something
really simple so you can see the mascara
what I apply it but so far I really like
this palette I like how everything blood
did I really like this rustic shade I
applied most of that like right here at
the outer corners and I love the
undertone of this shade or vina that say
that this wood was more like the modern
renaissance palette in terms of formula
and I totally agree so now I'm gonna try
out the bad gal bang
mascara I have heard so many mixed
reviews on this this mascara seems to
work better once you've curled your
lashes first alright so I'm gonna try
not to apply too much of this product
because from what I've seen less is more
so less see okay so what I notice
immediately it doesn't really make my
lashes thicker but it does make them a
lot longer but I do notice that it's
starting to Club at the ends you know
how certain mascaras will have will get
like a little black ball at the very tip
of your lashes that drives me crazy I'm
gonna take my morphe b71 brush I love
this little guy alright so I'm zooming
you in to show you the foundation and
the mascara so far I don't know if I'm
loving this mascara there's something
about it that is rubbing me the wrong
way and I can't figure out what it is I
think my foundation looks great I am
starting to notice it settled into my
lines a bit but you know that's normal I
have lines it doesn't look as beautiful
and amazing as I did when I first
applied it but I do still like the
finish I'm scared it's gonna get too
matte throughout the day or too drying
throughout the day though because I'm
starting to see it look a little bit
more matte than I wanted it to look but
that's okay so I'm gonna quickly pop on
this Dior Addict lacquer stick lip balm
in the shade rolling oh yeah guys that's
pretty much it I'm gonna wear this
throughout the day and then I will get
back to you at the end of the night hey
guys I'm back I'm done I'm happy doing
my gold is getting to me okay guys my
nose has been running all day
a constant struggle all day but I am
here to give you my final thoughts on
this foundation looking like a crazy
person okay right off the mat I want to
say I have no foundation here anymore
like it's completely gone and that is
not the Foundation's fault that is my
Colts fault
I haven't blowing my nose literally all
day rubbing my face my mouth and my nose
like this area right here has been in a
tissue all day non-stop so you know
apparently just a foundation on that
area but on the rest of my face I don't
think it looks that bad
I completely forgot to show you the time
earlier today my fault over there haha
but I was done doing my makeup and I
looked at the time it was like 3:15 and
it is 11:03 p.m. obviously and that's
about 8 hours my shameless foundation
wear test was around 8 hours as well I
guess that's that's typical for me here
I wanted to film this video earlier in
the day so I can try to get like 12
hours out of it but I think it looks
pretty good for being 8 hours there are
some concerns like for example there is
a pimple here that I I'm almost positive
I didn't have before this foundation
right on my face right here was that
there and it has also faded really
strangely right here at like up splotchy
right here but I wonder if that was from
when I laid down and took a nap on my
kitchen table no there was a lot going
on today and I think it actually looks
pretty good
props are still are I mean a little
patchy but still on my highlight looks
pretty decent actually liked how it made
my skin look throughout the day like it
started to wear a little bit better
because I don't know if you noticed but
when I was done doing my entire face
what's the foundation had settled and
set into my skin I didn't love it as
much as I did when I initially applied
it but as it wore throughout the day it
kind of like meshed with my skin it does
look a little bit dry in between my
brows but I find that to be the case
with a lot of different foundations
honestly I think I really really like
this foundation it's ten dollars I think
I'm gonna be playing around with this a
lot because I was so so impressed
I think the foundations look lighter in
the bottle than they do when you swatch
them because this doesn't look that
light on the face so I might just be
medium beige on its own I should have
swatched these before but I'm a fool I
honestly can't wait to play around with
this one nation more mixing it in with
illuminizer or like an oil or maybe you
know what I'm gonna take some setting
spray and I just let see how this looks
with some setting spray on it because
I'm not even gonna lie to you I never
wear foundation without applying setting
spray ever ever it just makes everything
looks so much better so a lot of the
times with these foundation or whose I'm
like oh it's my setting spray but I
don't want that to alter the foundation
or the review or anything so I never do
it but well that's drying let me give
you a quick little review on everything
else I really like this bronzer I mean
I'm not in love with it just yet I'm
still testing it out but so far so good
I really like this blush it's very
natural very creamy feeling very very
nice formula and consistency very smooth
this mascara is okay honestly like man I
forgot to show you guys my close-up
right now before applying the setting
spray I can't film videos when I have a
cold anymore I can't do it Canada I'm
still gonna zoom you in and show you my
skin up close anyway like I was saying
about this mascara this video is all
over the place I think it's pretty
average
it made my lashes pretty long but I
didn't really see any thickness or
anything and it was getting pretty
clumpy pretty quickly for the price I
totally do not think it's worth it I
would pass on this one but that's just
me and the soft clamp palette is pretty
freakin awesome it's still on my eyes it
looks great blended beautifully
that's the name plus and this foundation
is a major A+ okay so I'm gonna zoom you
in and show you my skin I know I just
sprayed my face but it is what it is
okay I'm sorry so obviously you can see
it's completely coming off here in this
area but I think my skin still looks
pretty healthy even before the setting
spray it just looked really nice and it
looked better as I wore it at least on
my dry skin I feel that way so yeah I
give these foundations a big thumbs up
every time I do a foundation review I
want to compare it to my last foundation
review so compared to the Marc Jacobs
shameless foundation I like this one a
lot a lot more and it is like $40
cheaper so yes okay guys that completes
this video I hope you enjoyed this
really all over the place first
