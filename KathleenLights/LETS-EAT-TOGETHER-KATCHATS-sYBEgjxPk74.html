this is so weird have so much anxiety
right now you have no idea so it's a
nice video as a cat chats I literally
don't know what we're gonna be talking
about but we're just gonna be talking
this is actually my first and maybe my
last attempt at a look bong mukbang
Hmong I'm not exactly sure you say that
I'm probably saying it wrong try think
about how Kim Chi says it and I don't
remember mukbang I just quickly want to
warn you guys if you hate milk bongs or
if you hate anything where people are
eating on camera X out this video I
catch you on the next one you will not
like this video you will hate it so just
to a boys oh my god this I hate this
video I hate people chewing just to
avoid all that I just like don't watch
the video you know catch my next one it
will not be me eating I promise and you
know what I used to be that person to I
used to be that kind of person my best
friend Amelia watches these videos all
the time for years and I used to watch
her watch them and be like okay why are
you watching that but one day this is
how it started
I think I was like on a road trip
somewhere I'm not exactly sure what I
was doing but I remember being in the
car and I was starving
I was so hungry that for some reason I
don't know what it was I just decided to
like YouTube a mukbang and then I just
started watching these videos and I know
it's so weird I bet I mean I can only
watch specific people because it still
gives me the creeps and just watching
people eat and chew and like slurp and
talk and all of that so it gives me the
creeps but for some reason it feels like
a little satisfying boy I don't know and
I love watching these videos as I'm
sitting down eating lunch like I love
eating lunch watching these kinds of
videos I don't know actually did a poll
on Twitter and I asked you guys I was
like how do you guys feel about MOOC
bongs and I think it was like 49% like
them and 51% dislike them so it's like a
lot a lot of you hate them I mean I I
kind of hate them but in the back of my
mind I know I don't anyway so I order
from
he is actually eating his by himself
because I wanted to film this video I
thought it would be cool to just sit
down have a really like casual laid-back
conversation grab your lunch grab your
breakfast grab your dinner we can sit
down and have it together and if you
like these videos maybe I'll do them
like once every three months anyway so I
know Chili's isn't like the healthiest
thing in the world I try my best to eat
really really healthy throughout the
week but sometimes sometimes I like to
cheat a little bit sometimes I like to
have food I'm not supposed to eat fried
foods you know I think it's okay to
indulge every once in a while and every
time I go to Chili's I usually just get
the same thing this is like one of those
Fiesta Mexican bowls this is like the
chicken one but I get it without chicken
and I also get no cheese since I take
off the chicken I just get extra beans
extra avocado
they always skimp out on my avocado all
the time and then extra rice as well so
it's not like and I get a lot of
questions about how I eat I just I don't
eat dairy at all and I also don't eat me
really I know there has to be some dairy
in it
maybe I'm not sure this has area but
honestly I love the Chili's chips and
salsa it's my favorite chips and salsa
from like a regular chain restaurant I
love the chips and salsa from like
authentic Mexican restaurants --is
restaurants but like for a regular
restaurant I love the Chili's one the
salsa is delicious the chip is to win
cheats oh but no matter what everything
I order in life whenever I go out to
restaurants has to have a side of fries
if I go to a restaurant and they don't
have fries I don't know I just I don't
know what I'm doing and I know it's too
bad for you I was actually reading an
article not too long ago about how
French fries are terrible for you
because obviously they're fried but I
can't live without french fries it's my
favorite side it's like my favorite side
of all time if I can't eat fries with it
what's the point what's the point is
actually my own
how many of you guys like to mix
mayonnaise and ketchup for your dipping
sauce when I was younger I used to think
that was so weird when put in meet Leah
and her brother Eric you said you'd like
that all the time and then like they got
me on to it me now of course I use just
Mayo because it is dairy-free
I can eat old fries cold fries crispy
fries soggy fries any kind of fried you
give me I will eat it the thing that
gets me about these mock bone things is
I hate eating while I'm talking I was
like how am I not supposed to do that
like in these videos you have to do that
so I feel like that's what throws people
off l-like that's what turns people off
to these videos you know I actually want
to get Amelia to do this video with me
I think it'll end up being better
because one person gonna be talking
while the other person is eating and I
feel like you just have a better
conversation that way you know so I'm
gonna ask her if she wants to from these
videos with me if you guys want to see
it man I have been so sucked into
supernatural the show I cannot I can't
watch anything else I can't do anything
else I used to be able to watch like ten
shows at once but now supernatural has
taken over my life I have started how to
get away with murder again that came
back my show was amazing by far my
favorite Shonda Rhimes show Grey's
Anatomy fans calm down but how to get
away murders my favorite and also the
walking dead I mean that is the best
show on TV right now though I would say
The Walking Dead is one of the best
shows of all time definitely like top
four
when it comes to dramas like obviously
aside from friends new girl the Mindy
project like all my favorite comedies
drama The Walking Dead is so good
for me the book it goes like this I
would say Dexter is my number one show
of all time I love it I think the ending
is absolute garbage the worst ending
they could have given that show they
gave it so that takes off major points
for that reason but it's such a good
show I would say Dexter is my number one
then I don't know it's a tie between
Sons of Anarchy and The Walking Dead I'm
not sure I don't know which one I love
more they're both so good and the writer
of Sons of Anarchy is like amazing
he's brilliant I love him and honestly
to me that show had one of the best
endings I've ever seen to me the ending
is the most important part of a show
because for me I wanted to make sense I
want the show to go in a complete circle
I want and it doesn't have to be a happy
ending but I want a good ending and Sons
of Anarchy so many people hated it but I
thought it ended like a frickin poem it
was so good and Breaking Bad also ended
so beautifully as well I really liked
breaking back I think The Walking Dead
is better I know everyone don't kill me
I know there are huge Breaking Bad fans
out there I mean Breaking Bad is up
there though that's a great great great
story great job I also really loved
Prison Break and then they ruined it by
bringing it back like I came to terms
with the ending had my grief period okay
I cried I accepted it and I moved on and
then they just came and opened two kind
of worms and just ruined they just
ruined everything
mind you I've only seen the first two
episodes of that reboot but I hate it as
I'm watching it I'm just I hate when
shows come back because if it ended well
like if Dexter came back that would be
great if they could fix that that'd be
excellent I just hate when you like mess
up a good thing you know
not anyway where I was getting at before
I have been watching Supernatural and
I'm obsessed I thought it was gonna be
so stupid I thought it was gonna be a
show that I just like played in the
background but I actually loved it I'm
on season six it gets so detailed and so
intense
don't fight for me that show is just
getting better and better which is why I
think it's been on the air for like 58
years on the air do you still say that
it's been on the air no oh I also think
you're not supposed to edit Milkha bhaag
videos because I think that's the whole
point like for people to watch it but
not a hundred percent on board with
these kinds of videos I'm gonna edit out
my eating because it drives me crazy I'm
just giving this a test run you know I'm
saying I think it's so funny cuz the
other day I was watching an episode of
Supernatural
and Sam mentioned that his birthday was
May 2nd and that's Danny's birthday on
another episode Dean mentioned that his
birthday was January 24th which is three
days before my birthday I thought that
was pretty cool but Dean is 100% honest
if I can guess where Dean would be he's
such an Aquarius I can't but for sure
Sam is not a Taurus no if I had to guess
like the character Sam I would get I
would guess him to be like a like a
Pisces
or a cancer definitely a water sign
actually yeah maybe even a Scorpio
because he is feisty he has anger
problems I get a lot of questions about
zodiac stuff
I'm just so into it if you really look
into it it is incredibly accurate I mean
I'm getting so good at guessing people's
signs it's it's a little scary and I
know I get such a bad rap when you talk
about like zodiac signs and stuff they
automatically link it to horoscopes and
like oh my god that's such bull crap and
like so in general and that says it for
everybody but no zodiac signs are so
much deeper than horoscopes horoscopes
are actually bull crap they really are I
never read my horoscope they say the
same thing to everybody I would not go
by that but if you actually do like
research and look into your zodiac sign
and your moon sign and like your birth
chart in general you would agree with me
I'm gonna try to link um like a website
down below so you can fill out your
birth chart and see what your own saying
is like I'm an Aquarius but my moon sign
is Scorpio which up until I knew that I
thought that I was like not an Aquarius
at all though Deacs make no sense cuz
I'm nothing like an Aquarius which as an
adult I realize now that I kind of am
but there were so many things I never
related to at all our horses love to be
free they hate commitment they hate to
be tied down they like to just like be
like ah like a free bird I got married
at 19 I love come here man I think it's
great
and when I was younger I was just like
very very jealous not about like
personal things like I don't care if you
had something that I didn't I was
jealous about people when my friendships
aegyo was jealous about my friends and
my parents and even my siblings like I
remember one time I was like 10 years
old we had it caught on video I remember
like Janine my cousin wanted to do like
a postcard for my dad for his birthday
she was like oh my god let's make your
dad like a happy birthday card and I
freaking lost it on her I lost it I was
like excuse me he's my dad first of all
no bingo and my parents got divorced
after I was 18 because I would have been
that stepchild from hell
you know now realize as an adult that
that is 100% because of my Scorpio moon
your Scorpio is out there y'all be crazy
I feel like I relate so much to my
Scorpio loon the fact that I get really
awkward during hugs I'm not very
touchy-feely at all I'm like really
uncomfortable if someone complements me
it makes me really nervous like I'm very
awkward in that situation and I feel
like that's very Aquarius and sometimes
it gives people the impression that I'm
very cold and that I'm not very like
warm and huggy and lovey which I could
see that I could see that that is
something I don't like about myself I
feel like sometimes when people hug me
without realizing I like tense up I'm
like hmm I don't know why I guess it's
cuz I'm an Aquarius it's just the rest
of your birth chart is so important you
have a Sun Sign you have a moon sign you
have a rising sign and then the rest of
the planets and all that stuff it's
crazy
but it just all makes so much sense like
my rising sign is Leo which by the way
is literally the only fire sign in my
entire birth chart the rest of my pads
are like 90% Capricorn which is 100% the
reason why I feel like I am such a wussy
there's no fire I hate confrontation I
hate I hate arguments I swear in middle
school and maybe I had to fight all my
battles sometimes I wish I did have a
little Airy stone in my birth chart
somewhere because I feel like for you
too
you really really need thick skin in
order to do this I don't have thanks
good I mean John you're wrong it's
gotten a lot better actually since
starting YouTube any little negative
comment honestly before used to like
make me cry I feel like I've gotten way
better I get stupid make comments now
and I'm like but I also feel like I've
gotten better because I've got an older
and man these days
social media is such a dark dark place
everything everything is about bashing
somebody everything is about the drama
something negative like people who love
it they love it and I get it it's
entertaining cool but social media has
become such a dark hole that I really
like feel bad for all the young women
coming into YouTube or all the young
women starting YouTube starting
Instagram because when I was younger I
let everything get to me I didn't really
know who I was I was like struggling
with myself and my confidence so if I
would have started YouTube at 15 like so
many girls do I don't know how I would
have handled it people can be so mean on
the internet and to them they're just
writing a comment they're just writing a
comment on somebody's page it's nothing
to them but the person receiving the
comment like it hurts them you know I
feel like everything is so negative now
and and you're not cool unless you're
negative and I can mess unless you're
bashing a product you're worthless what
the heck is that
my alarm going off I know I do hope
social media gets more positive because
the last thing we need in this shitty
world this can I help you
what I was saying was I hope social
media gets better because the older I
got the more I realized how important it
is to be kind to people even sometimes
when you think that person doesn't
deserve it you have no idea what's going
on in that other person's head the the
things they're dealing with internally
some people lash out and are mean just
because they're having a bad day like
you don't know so I feel like you should
always be kind and you should try always
to be kind man kindness really does go a
long way and I always appreciate it when
someone is nice to me I remember those
things and they stay with me just like
mean comments they stay with you so if
you can impact somebody's life in a
positive way why not just even a nice
comment that can make somebody's day and
you not even know it you know I spend
every single day trying to better myself
trying to be a better person because
honestly honestly think about this
what's the point of living life if
you're not constantly learning lessons
like we're constantly changing and
evolving like I'm not the same person I
was 10 years ago
I mean obviously I was 15 I'm constantly
learning I just always strive to be
better and I feel like that should be
everybody's goal
kindness goes a really really long way
I'm stuffed I can not be beating I mean
not that I left much anyway guys I am
done with dinner
I'm gonna go edit a video I'm actually
pre recording this week for next week
