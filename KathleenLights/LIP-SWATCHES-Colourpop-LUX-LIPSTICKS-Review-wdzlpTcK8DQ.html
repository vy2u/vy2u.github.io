a full lip swatch video I'm gonna be
swatching all of the new color pop luxe
lipsticks I'm gonna swatch all 24 of
them on my lips look how beautiful look
at me 12 I'm gonna talk about the
packaging formula I'm gonna totally
review the lipsticks but I'm gonna leave
that towards the end of the video
because I know the main thing you guys
want to see are the lip swatches and I
know I know this is like another color
pop video I feel like I've been posting
lots of color puppy videos recently but
there's just been a lot of things to
talk about and I know that you guys
really requested the look I was wearing
in my best of colour-pop video and I
actually did film it for you that day I
haven't gotten around to editing it but
that should be the next video I post so
like another color pop tutorial but it's
you know my drinks your palate it's the
look you guys really wanted to see so
anyway if you want to hear my first
impressions and my review on this
product wait till the end but for now
let's go ahead and jump into some lip
swatches
okay so I hope you guys enjoyed those
lip swatches as you guys saw these are
extremely extremely pigmented it was
actually the first time that I had tried
them on my lips I had watched a couple
of them like on my hand when I first got
them but I hadn't put them on my lips
until today and oh my gosh I have so
much to say so these are the new color
pop luxe lip sticks they retail for
seven dollars each and they come in this
beautiful beautiful packaging it's like
embossed with stars on the actual
lipstick but the packaging is a really
beautiful rose gold with little stars
all over it I don't know it just feels
really luxurious to me like it does feel
very luxe
like I can totally see this kind of
lipstick at Sephora from another brand
and it being like twenty five dollars
you know it feels very luxurious these
also don't have a scent if you're
wondering I mean maybe a slight slight
scent but it's so mild I could barely
smell it and it is a pleasant scent as
well the formula is really what makes
these lipsticks so awesome they are so
creamy and buttery and just so smooth
that they apply like a dream it's like
one swipe you get full paint color I
mean you guys saw as I was applying them
you guys know they're lippie stix they
come in like different finishes they
have the matte X they have creams they
have mattes but all of these lipsticks
come in like a satin finish all of them
have the same type of finish and it's
not too matte not too sheer not too
glossy it's like a perfect satin finish
lipstick and I really like that they
stuck to one formula for all of these
lipsticks because the formula is just so
good right now I'm wearing a pea on my
lips I think this might be my favorite
one I love a good nude obviously this is
the first time I use them so first I put
them on my face so I don't know if
they're really long-lasting I'm gonna be
wearing a pea for the rest of the day
and then I'm gonna leave you a little
note in my description box letting you
know how it lasted that it not lasted oh
you know I'm just gonna update you guys
in the info box on its where time but
I'm assuming it's not gonna last a super
long time since this is like a
traditional lipstick not a liquid
lipstick but honestly so far I'm really
liking these it's like every time I put
one on my lips I was like oh my gosh
that was beautiful the only colors I
don't like are the darker ones just
because you know I'm so used to liquid
six already and I'm gonna wear a super
dark lip I want it to be a liquid
lipstick I want that full matte long
wearing formula when it comes to dark
shades but all the other shades are so
yummy and delicious and I see myself
using like the majority of these I love
the color selection I would say my
favorites for sure Appy and still crazy
I love those I hear I love still crazy
this one is awesome as well and I
actually really really love this one
even though it's so light I don't really
like how it looks this is in the shade
boy but I love the name of it so like I
really want to use this lipstick maybe
I'll wear it with like a really dark
nude lip liner and then I can make it
work because okay super random but
chanel has this lipstick that I've
always wanted to purchase it's called
boy
este se button really really loves that
lipstick and I've always been meaning to
get my hands on it just for the name of
it for some reason I like the name boy
for a lipstick and then when I saw that
they came out with a bully I got really
really excited I just don't love how
nude it is but I'm totally gonna make
this work maybe mix with this oh yeah oh
yeah
oh I really like that I feel like I'm
gonna be using this to mix with others a
lot because out of all of them the only
one that had a like weird patchy look on
my lips was this one when you got up
close like you saw like you saw the
lipstick just sitting on my lips and
that's probably because it is like such
a white based nude but none of the other
ones are talking I'm telling you this
formula is so incredible like oh my gosh
they really did such a good job with
these lipsticks it's seven dollars and
you get 3.5 grams of product I was just
looking on their website and I had no
idea so many of them were sold out so
I'm so so sorry
but I'm sure they'll be back in stock
soon colour-pop does restock pretty
quickly so just keep your eyes peeled I
give these a big thumbs up A+ plus from
me definitely leave me a comment down
below letting me know what you think of
these lipsticks are you planning on
picking them up have you picked any of
them up I personally think they Rock but
that completes this video guys thank you
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
