a lip swatch video on the new la girl
glazed lip paints got poop I've got a
ton to share with you guys so the brand
is called
la girl and they already had six of
these colors in their collection and
then they came out with twelve more so I
do have all 12 of them to share with you
guys and I got so excited when I found
out that they were releasing these
because I was so impressed with the
original six shades when I heard that
there was going to be 18 in total I was
like very excited so I do want to
quickly get into the lip swatches I
don't want this video to be too long
because I already reviewed the original
six shades if you do want to see an
in-depth review I will link that video
down below if you want to see the where
like how long it lasts what I think
about the formula the scent all like a
really in-depth review on these things
then I will link that video down below
but I know some of you have already seen
that video or some of you already own
the original six so I don't want to go
into a whole in depth review I just
really want to show you these swatched
live on my lips I think that's what
people mostly want to see anyway is the
new colors on some lips but just to give
a quick tiny review I love them they're
really great they're super super
pigmented and they're high shine lip
products and like I said in the other
video I definitely recommend using a lip
liner with these because they're so
glossy pigments and shiny they might
slip everywhere and LA girl also came
out with these lip liners they are
called the endless semi-permanent
long-lasting lip liners and that is a
heck of a claim I've actually haven't
used these yet so I'm really excited to
try these and these actually match or
pair perfectly with all the different
lip paints if you want to see a first
impressions on this I will definitely do
it for you I will apply it on my lips
and wear it throughout the day and let
you know if it really is semi-permanent
and long-lasting let me know down below
and I will definitely review the lip
liners so yeah the twelve new shades are
great they range from nudes to dark deep
bamboo Purple's phenomenal they all have
a cream finish as in
there's no glitter in them except for
two of them these two actually are the
only ones in the collection that do have
glitter in them but this one is actually
one of my favorite ones definitely top
three the glitter in this is what makes
this one so incredibly beautiful the
only thing I will say that I wish they
would have come out with is like a more
nudie kind of color like these are
obviously nudes but I wish they would
have come out with a more like brown
based nude like a little bit of a deeper
nude this one is like a very very light
nude still very gorgeous and this one is
more of a pink nude I wish they would
have come out with like a brown everyday
natural nude color if you know what I
mean but other than that these are
incredible like I said you want to in
depth review I'll link it down below but
enough chitchat
let's get into the lip swatches okay so
this first one is called gleam and it is
a nice bronzy shade with orange
undertones and it does have a frost
finish this isn't really my favorite one
but I think it would look so pretty on
deeper skin tones this next one is
called whisper it is probably the one
that is the most nude out of the bunch
and it is a little bit of a pale nude
but I think it would look so beautiful
on light to medium skin tones mostly
light skin tone since it is so pale but
it's so beautiful I remember you could
definitely mix these colors and get a
customized color this next one is called
elude and it is the pinky or nude in the
bunch I think it is so pretty and it
would complement so many different skin
tones it's just that every day pinky
nude that looks good on a lot of people
and it's definitely a must-have out of
all 12
this one is called flirt and it's just a
typical Barbie like bubblegum pink I
personally love colors like this
especially in the spring and summer
I love these babydoll pink colors and I
think a lot of people would really like
it
this next one I'm not sure if I'm
pronouncing it right peony I'm not
exactly sure but it is such a bright
beautiful coral it looks a lot more like
brighter in person it's so pretty if you
are a fan of coral lip glosses or
lipstick definitely pick a peony because
it is gorgeous this next one is so much
fun to wear it is called tango and it is
a hot hot coral the other one was nice
and bright but this one it's like a hot
summertime version it is so pretty and
loud but beautiful too this one is
definitely one of my favorite ones it is
the one I was saying that has glitter in
it but because of the glitter look at
that shine it looks so pretty it's
called T's and it is a bright bright
magenta hot pink with a little bit
purple seriously it is stunning and
definitely pick this one up it is
beautiful
this next one I really really love
because I think it is the perfect lilac
shade some lavenders can look really bad
on the lips and kind of wash you out and
make you look dead especially if you
have light skin tones but this one is
perfect because it does have that pink
undertone it's not just a plain purple
lavender had a little bit of pink so
it's definitely wearable for a bunch of
different skin tones okay so now we're
getting more into the deeper berry
shades this one is called seduced and it
is a beautiful fuchsia this one
definitely packs a punch like the second
I put it on it was just so vibrant and
glossy and pretty if you're into
fuchsias this one is a good one this
next one is called daring and it is the
perfect fall shade in my opinion because
it does have that purple berry look to
it but it is still very deep so pretty
in the fall time definitely pick this
one up if you're into those you know
dark fall colors it's really pretty
these are starting to look a little bit
sloppy on my lips because I didn't use a
lip liner and you know darker colors can
tend to look a little you know this is
called tempt and in the tube it looks a
lot more purple than it comes off on the
lips on the lips it's just a little bit
more red but still has that very
undertone
and then this is the one that I was
wearing throughout the entire video and
it is called spicy it is such a
beautiful orange but it has a lot of red
to it so it's not too scary it is
definitely very wearable okay guys so
that is the end of this video I hope
these swatches on my actual lips helped
you guys out in a way I feel like
they're just so much more helpful than
nice watching them in the back of my
hand you guys know how I roll so thank
