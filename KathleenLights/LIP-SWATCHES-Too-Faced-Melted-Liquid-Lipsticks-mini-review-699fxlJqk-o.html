hey guys so I quickly wanted to get this
video up because it's already like five
o'clock and it's getting super late and
I should have filmed this video earlier
but you know how my life is at the
moment so this was a quick lip swatch
video on the Too Faced melted liquefied
long word lipsticks and I know that I
had lip swatch week not too long ago so
it's like okay another lip swatch video
but this was actually one of the videos
that was supposed to go up in the swatch
week but the file got corrupted when I
was editing it so I had to wait till
like got into the new place and film it
all over again and a lot of you guys are
like where is that two-faced video so
here it is my lip my fingers are like
all stained from the lip stuff anyway
there's not much to say about these I
love these these are probably one of my
favorite lip products in general like of
all time I love the melted lipsticks
like half of these were purchased by me
and the other half or like sent to me
just as a gift from Too Faced so that
goes to show you how much I love them I
purchased like a bunch of these on my
own I absolutely love them they're so
good
they are super super long wearing and
they feel really comfortable on the lips
they have like a natural finish I
wouldn't say they're 100% like Kat Von D
matte and they're not glossy if that
makes sense to like a happy medium some
of them feel a lot more glossy ER than
others like this one in melted melon I
don't know if I got like a weird one but
it's like super glossy on the lip even
when I wear like three for three hours I
mean it dries down to like a satin
finish but it's still a little bit like
shiny my melted melon which is what I
wanted to show you that but for the most
part they feel pretty matte satin like
which I really really love I love the
applicator it makes it super easy to get
um like all around the lips I do
recommend using a lip liner with these
just because you won't have a super
precise application without a lip liner
especially for the darker colors but
like for melted sugar
your melted nude melted to all those
colors I never really use a lip liner
because the applicator is so easy to use
I just love how they wear on the lips
super comfortable and for a really long
time the only thing I don't like is that
sometimes the darker colors do get all
over my teeth so I have to make sure
that I'm not bringing it in too close to
like my teeth if that makes sense but
other than that I think they're great
products especially the way that they
smell they smell like candy they smell
so good
like real delicious candy like a fruity
deliciousness
they're great so yeah I give these a big
a plus five stars across the board
they're really amazing there may be some
hit and misses with certain colors but
in terms of formula I think they're a
big win for me so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this quick little lip swatch
video I don't have all of them by the
way I lost like three of them in the
move I don't know where they were and I
don't even remember which ones I lost
but I lost like threw them in the move
and I don't have the full collection I
think they have like twenty two of them
I don't have them aw but I will have
them all because I love them so thank
you guys so much for watching please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
