say this and like every one of these
collection videos but today's video is
an exciting one I am excited I cannot
contain my excitement there's a few
things I want to talk about in this
video and I don't want it to be a
hundred years long so I'm just gonna
jump into it I'm just gonna get started
lips and Sam's has officially launched
if you're watching this video right now
lips and tips is ready to go
Kol polish calm and is there it is ready
we have launched and in today's video we
are gonna talk all about it I am so
excited to sit down discuss this journey
with you because I have so much to say
and honestly this is my favorite part
about making nail polish and having my
own nail polish company it's just
sitting down and talking to you guys
about the process and like the whole
thing you know I feel like I'm sharing
this information with a friend and we're
just hanging out and talking about it so
I have been working on this collection
since Kol polish started this was on my
to-do list the second we launched our
first original six colors I was taking a
shower one day and I just thought of
this idea I have always liked matching
my lipstick to my nail polish it's
something I've always done my sister and
I do this all the time if I would wear
red nail polish I used to love wearing
red lipstick to match the nail polish or
like bright orange nail polish I loved
wearing an orange lip it was just the
thing I loved doing so because I had my
own colors already with color pop you
guys know how but ton of lips created
with color pop already and one day I was
in the shower and I was like oh my gosh
what if I created nail polishes that
matched the lipsticks I created with
color pop and I immediately got started
on it and let me tell you let me tell
you it was a lot harder than I thought
it was gonna be to match nail polishes
to lipsticks perfectly it is it is hard
it's hard guys so I'm gonna talk to you
guys all about the process and how
difficult it was but how fun and amazing
it was but this is what the collection
looks like there's so much information I
want to talk about I feel like I don't
even know where to start so this
collection has six nail polishes that
were inspired by six of my lippies with
color pop this is point zero behind the
little lip here is Alyssa and there's
tour
Lumiere November and Aquarius and this
one my way was inspired by the Aquarius
lippie stix like the original Aquarius
not all the other Aquarius and Lumiere
is based off of the original Lumiere of
course not Lumiere - which is much more
like intense and purple kind of reminds
me of Mozart almost a little bit know if
you get the box set so if you buy the
full collection you get a free
colour-pop ultra satin lip so this box
is the exact same price as my faul box
like my Fall collection only with this
one you get a free ultra satin lip which
is amazing I thought it was so cool to
do that for you guys and I thought it
just made a sense you know so you'll
either get an ultra satin lip in
November point-0 or Alisa I thought it
made more sense to give you an ultra
satin lip instead of a lippy stick I
mean they're six dollars the lippy six
or five dollars
I thought the satin lip would be a
better it would be a better situation
for you guys oh yes I'm so excited I
hope you guys love this collection I
know most of you if you are buying this
collection it's probably because you
already have some of my lippies with
colour-pop so if you already own the one
that comes in the box you can give it to
your friend share the love or save it as
a backup but yeah I am so excited and
let's get into what you really want to
see so these are what the colors look
like and I already know your concerns I
know you look at this and you're like
wow those seem very similar and the only
channel that are similar are these two
right here as you can obviously tell
they look more similar in the bottle
than swatched on the hand but it's ELISA
and Lumiere but the rest of these are
very different from one another
and I have to say there are three colors
that really gave me a hard time when I
tried to match them perfectly and that
was ELISA Aquarius and point zero I was
on the struggle bus for a long time but
I'll explain as I go along I'm just
gonna get started in no particular order
let's start off with November this is
actually my mom's favorite one out of
all of them speaking of my mom you guys
really love the fact that I insert in
pictures of my mom wearing all the
colors on her nails in like my fall
video so I will be doing that in this
video today as well she's watched all of
them on her nails for you guys to see
and she took the picture in natural
lighting like outside in her backyard
but you will also see me swatching them
on like my little plastic nails like
usual and and
I mean this is a lips and tips
collection so throughout the video I
will be showing you how they look
against the lip color obviously so I'm
going to show you clips of me wearing
Taurus while wearing Taurus on my nails
and seem for all of the other shades
just so you can see what they look like
together you know it's I mean it's a
lips and sips collection right anyway
the first one is November and this is
actually a big hit at my house whenever
my friends come over family members come
over I always try out all my nail
polishes on them just because I want as
many opinions as I can before releasing
a product and every time somebody would
try this on at my house they fell in
love with November it was just like a
thing everyone likes this color and it
is so pretty it's such a nice pink I
mean if you own the November lippy it's
pretty much identical to it like almost
spot-on they look so cute together it's
like so fun and fresh and this color is
completely opaque on two coats you could
even get away with just doing one coat
of this I mean you can kind of see the
nail underneath just a little bit but I
mean if you were in a rush and you could
only do one coat I think you wouldn't
hate it you know but it looks it's true
beautiful self with two coats and this
is the perfect nail polish for you if
you're into an everyday pink it's a
little bit brighter than like your
typical nude pink oh by the way that's
another thing I wanted to mention this
collection is not for the bold
I don't maybe weird to hear but I know
there's a ton of people out there who
love like really bold colors blues and
greens and bright purples and neon
shades but you're not gonna get that
with this obviously I mean you guys know
that but this is a very everyday
collection like this is the perfect nail
polish for you if for example you work
at a school or you work at a place where
they don't really let you wear bold nail
polishes this is the perfect collection
for you because these polishes are
literally nudes I mean obviously like
Taurus is not nude on me but somebody
with a deeper skin tone it does show up
a little bit more nude on them for
example like when Amelia wears Taurus on
her lips and I wear tours they look like
two completely different colors on hair
it looks so much lighter and more nude
it looks gorgeous on her skin tone I
love it so it really just depends on
your skin tone but they're all extremely
wearable colors in my opinion they're
all really flattering even point-0 I
think they are just so so beautiful but
anyway I am rambling so much and driving
myself crazy okay so next up we have
Aquarius and this one is my favorite in
the entire collection not just because
color but just because it's just so easy
to use this one is like my perfect nude
if I had to pick one nude nail polish
for the rest of my life I'm pretty sure
I would be Aquarius this one though this
was a really hard one to work on it's
not the exact same color as the lippy
stick I will just let you know right off
the bat they do look different but when
I was working on this and I tried to
make it look identical to the lippy
stick it just wasn't working I would try
to add more beige and it looked weird I
would try to have more pink and it just
didn't look anything like it and when I
got almost spot-on
the color was almost identical to Miss
Honey so I just had to start all over
and try to find a balance somewhere when
this batch was made and I was testing
out the sample I had tested out well
felt like hundreds and hundreds of
aquarius's before this point when I did
the first coat of this nail polish I
fell in love I completely fell in love
with it my favorite way to wear this
polish is with one coat I think it is so
similar to Aquarius if you only do one
coat once you add the second coat to
this it already changes the color it
makes it a bit deeper and it looks less
like Aquarius but with one coat there's
Sol Sol similar I honestly would
recommend if you want to match Aquarius
to this color just do one coat and
honestly I think it's so beautiful like
I was telling you earlier this is my
favorite polish because it is the
easiest polish to apply I don't know
what it is about this shade but I don't
even have to clean around the edges like
that's how easy it is I just apply it
and I don't know if it's because it's a
light color I don't know if it's because
it almost has a little bit of a jelly
consistency it's a cream for sure all of
these are creams if this one is almost
like a cream jelly hybrid almost a
little bit more cream than jelly but you
know it's almost there this is the color
that lives on my toes by the way I've
been wearing queries on my toes for like
six months now I can't stop it looks so
cute on the toes I love it this is the
perfect out the door nail polish if
you're like oh my gosh
I have to go to a wedding and have to be
there in like 20 minutes and I forgot to
do my nails you grabbed Aquarius you do
your nails in 10 seconds and you're out
the door obviously you get like the full
opacity with two coats but I don't know
there's something about it on one coat
that looks so pretty to me and by the
way just so you guys are not confused in
my mom's pictures she did two coats for
every single nail polish and all that
you see of me throughout this video
where I'm wearing the lippies on my lips
and the nail polish on my fingers I also
did two coats with every single color
except for Aquarius I just wanted you
guys to see
Aquarius with one coat because I think
it looks so pretty and I love this nail
polish so much which by the way by the
way oh my gosh that's it new is all over
the place I just can't even contain
myself
today it I need to come down but anyway
I wouldn't necessarily pick this color
for Taurus and I would not pick this
color for Aquarius so I don't think
these colors match their zodiac signs
but since I wanted to name the lippies
with color pop after me and Danny zodiac
signs this is what I went with but don't
worry if I ever do a zodiac nail polish
collection the rest of the colors will
definitely match their zodiac sign the
same if that ever happens sometime
alright so next up we have the og lippy
stick we have Lumiere there's something
about this nail polish that makes me
really giddy and makes me really happy
because it's not my first nail polish
but it was my first collab ever Lumiere
lippy stick was the first time I ever
worked on a project and it was a
mind-blowing experience I had the best
time creating Lumiere and I had the best
time creating the nail polish as well it
worked really hard on this one I tried
it on everyone it's just Lumiere such as
tricky color because Lumiere looks
different on me then it looks on my mom
looks so different on everyone and I
feel like it got it as close as I was
gonna get and I'm very very happy with
this shade does look very similar to
Alyssa I'm not even gonna lie to you
guys
honestly I went back and forth with both
of those shades mainly Alyssa because I
had already approved Lumiere when I was
still working on Alyssa but I was asking
every single person in my life so these
two look too similar to lunch do these
two look too similar to lunch day when
you look at them on the bottle it's like
they look almost exactly the same but
it's not until you swatch them both with
two coats and you let it dry that they
do look different like if I had Lumiere
and I saw Alyssa at the store I would
totally buy it and I know obviously I'm
gonna say that because I created it but
if you're a nail polish fanatic if you
love to collect nail polishes like if
you're one of those people like I was
like I so am now I think it would
totally feel the same way if you're
someone who has like 10 nail Paul
in your collection and you only get
colors you really really love and you
could totally pick out individual shades
like if you don't want Alissa you only
want Lumiere couldn't totally do that
but Alissa is more pink while Lumiere is
definitely more mod and it's absolutely
stunning I love this guy all right next
up we have point zero and my my my was
the Swan a challenge it is eighth grade
nail polish but it does have a little
bit of like a neutral brown undertone I
will say the ultra satin lip is a bit
warmer than this it has a little bit
more Brown to it this is a bit of a
cooler version than point zero but still
they are similar when I try to add a
little bit more Brown to this shade it
just was throwing off the color so it is
a bit different they're not exactly the
same but they look so well paired
together I love this combo besides the
fact that point zero is probably my most
worn collab with color pop I try not to
wear it as much in my videos because I'm
constantly wearing it but now I'm so
excited to have a point zero nail polish
so pretty so 90s
I'm very very into this one I'm into all
of them but you know all right next up
is Taurus
I love brown nail polish especially for
this time of year I love it and this one
has that really beautiful holiday warm
undertone this one is so so so beautiful
and honestly I was thinking of wearing
Prince Cornelius for Thanksgiving but I
think I'm gonna wear tourist for things
or maybe I'll do a little bit of both
maybe I'll do like two nails Prince
Cornelius and then the rest or is I
don't know I'll figure it out but this
is such a beautiful fall shade I just
wanted to quickly show you what it looks
like next to broccoli and chocolate and
got a medal so the bottom one it's gotta
mellow it obviously looks nothing like
it this one's like a mustard but
broccoli and chocolate is a lot darker
it's much deeper much more rich this one
is a lot lighter and warmer so this one
is Taurus is absolutely beautiful and if
your Taurus you might really like it
which by the way I love Taurus okay and
then last but certainly not least we
have Alyssa this is the color I am
wearing on my nails right now and it is
the color I'm wearing on my lips right
now this one was the hardest freakin
color to do I don't know why every time
I tried to make it just a little bit
more pink than what it is now just to
match it a little bit better it would be
too pink it wouldn't look anything like
it so right before I was about to
approve this shade
ward in a video I worked on my nails and
I wore Alyssa on my lips and I asked you
guys like hey do you think my nails
match my lips and a few of you said it
was a little bit off but so many people
were like yes they match they match they
match and that was kind of like my okay
you're good to go good to approve I just
want to say thank you guys you helped me
and you didn't even know we finally got
as close as we were gonna get with this
color I love this shade I remember when
we filmed the ellipse and tips
commercial me and Jordan Jordan was
wearing ELISA and she was like oh my god
I love this color I feel like I could
wear this color every single day and
that's exactly how I feel I think Alyssa
is the most beautiful everyday pink on
this planet which is exactly how I feel
about the lip by the way I remember
wanting to create a lip that was like
the perfect pink for me and that's how
Alyssa came about and now that's how
this Alyssa came about so so excited for
this one and yeah guys those were
swatches
of the six new shades that are now
available on Cal Poly's calm always
remember if you do not want to buy the
entire collection if you don't want to
buy this bundle you can buy the nail
polishes individually so if you only
want like five out of the six or four
out of the six or one out of the six you
can absolutely do that just keep in mind
I just want to let you know so I don't
get the questions but the only way you
get the colour-pop lippie is if you get
the bundle obviously oh also oh my gosh
I can't believe I didn't say this in the
beginning of the video Wow okay this box
set is limited edition that is so
important I'm so sorry this box will not
