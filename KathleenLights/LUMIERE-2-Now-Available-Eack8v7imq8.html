probably like what in the world this is
the most random the most unplanned the
most spontaneous video I think I've ever
filmed so some of you might be really
really shocked really shocked really
confused okay so I think I'm more
nervous to film this video than I have
with any other launch okay so I'm going
to start at the beginning if you guys
have been following me for a really long
time you know that I have a little bad
boy right here named Lumiere and this is
my first collab ever colour-pop
approached me when I had 200,000
subscribers and they wanted me to collab
on a lipstick with them it was my first
collab it was the craziest experience it
was a dream call my collabs have been a
dream come true but this one it was my
first one so it was just completely
shocking and an experience it was an
amazing experience and Lumiere has just
been my baby ever since you know so many
of you guys have sent me pictures and
like tweets of how much you love Lumiere
I created a lippy stick and lippie
pencil and when I created Lumiere
I had like a vision of what color I
wanted to do something that was really
really flattering on a bunch of
different skin tones and I just knew
right off the bat what I wanted to do
this collab holds a place near and dear
to my heart
and ever since color pop launched their
ultra matte lips which are liquid
lipsticks ever since color pop launched
their liquid lipsticks I have gotten
emails messages Twitter a bunch of
people have told me oh my gosh can you
launch a liquid lipstick version of
Lumiere with color pop and I was always
like I'm not gonna do that I'm not gonna
take something that I'm not gonna take
this I'm not gonna do it but it was
almost like it was insane how many
people asked me to do that
I even a screenshot at a comment once
and I sent it to my friend Jordan who
works at color pop and I was like read
this and it was like please please
PLEASE create Lumiere and liquid
lipstick version and Jordan was like oh
my god that's so funny that people
really want that and it's just something
Jordan and I would like talked about all
the time like maybe I will maybe
who knows in the future maybe it would
be cool you guys saw the video where i
swatched all of the ultra matte lips on
my lips the color pop ones they weren't
my favorite liquid lipsticks I said it
in the video that they were good but
they weren't great and they have really
improved their formula now before
anybody tells me oh all of a sudden you
think that they improved their formula
note I think I said it in my November
favorites video I'm not exactly sure I
said it when I was raving about platform
that liquid lipstick they came out with
I love platform there are newer colors
and I'm not the only one who says it
there are newer colors are better
formulated and I've spoken to Jordan
about it and they have changed the
formula in their newer colors and it's
better the newer colors don't crack off
on me while they're older colors do not
gonna lie not a big fan of those older
colors but every time they launch
brand-new colors I just seemed to like
the formula more and more anyway with
that being said when I saw that they
revamped their formula a little bit I
had mentioned it to Jordan that I would
I would release Lumiere in a liquid
lipstick version if they were down with
it so out of the blue extremely random
that's why this has been so hush-hush
this has happened like in a span of two
weeks it's insane like this has happened
only in like two weeks
two to three weeks Jordan texts me and
she was like hey how do you feel about
launching a liquid lipstick version of
Lumiere on your birthday like as a
surprise I was like I'm listening and
that's exactly what happened if you guys
don't know today is my birthday I turned
well not today that I'm filming this
because I am leaving to California on
Monday so this video is being
pre-recorded but today when you're
watching this or when I post this I turn
24 today which is so weird I feel five
feel 12 ish 12 ish like 13 not 24 it's
so insane but anyway she had told me
that and I was like we'll see let's give
it a go they sent me a bunch of samples
of liquid lipsticks that were similar to
Lumiere they tried their best to get
like a color that's extremely close to
Lumiere but since they're totally
different formulas it was a little bit
difficult so I finally picked the one
that was closest and it's the one I'm
wearing right now
it's so weird okay so
I'm introducing to you a brand new
product by colour-pop and it is called
Lumiere 2
it's so funny because I was thinking
that I gave where the light is a sister
I gave it like a sexy sister where the
night is I decided to give Lumiere a
sister as well so this is Lumiere 2 and
it is a ultra matte lip by color pop and
it is almost the same color as the
mirror I will show you swatches here in
a minute but because there are different
formulas it's really hard to get the
exact color Lumiere
is a matte lipstick but compared to
their ultra matte lips this one almost
looks like a satin finish compared to
this this is like hella matte matte and
even though I do like their new and
improved liquid lipstick formula I am
wearing a lip primer with this
underneath the colour-pop liquid
lipsticks I always wear a lip primer
underneath because they just sit better
on my lips and they don't get into the
fine lines when I have a base underneath
this is almost the identical color but
it is deeper so this is going to show up
a little bit darker on your lips then
Lumiere does because it's a matte
formula and it does dry down and gets a
little bit darker but you actually
really really really really like that it
is a little bit different because if it
were the same thing that'd be kind of
honest but it is definitely the liquid
lipstick version of Lumiere like the
second I started putting it on I'm like
oh my god I'm wearing Lumiere but like
in a liquid lipstick it's crazy and it's
great because you can pair it with the
Lumiere lippie pencil to get like a more
precise application you can kind of use
this like underneath and then put this
on top and it's like the perfect little
combination so here is a swatch of the
original Lumiere lippy stick it is a
matte formula it's very creamy it lasts
a really long time on the lips and it's
not a drying matte or anything it's a
very very very hydrating matte and then
this is a swatch of the Lumiere lippie
pencil
I love the lippie pencil the most
because I really like the undertone it's
just a little bit different and I just
love how it looks on my lips I really
really really love the Lumiere lippie
pencil and then this is a swatch of the
Lumiere 2 ultra matte lip it's already
dried here in this swatch and as you can
see
it is deeper than Lumiere but very very
similar similar enough to be called
Lumiere too I think it's absolutely
beautiful I love the fact that it's just
a little bit deeper now before I get the
questions of okay but is it similar to
any of colourpop's
other ultra matte Libby's I've already
got you covered I have a picture that I
posted on Instagram and I will post it
here as well so you can see i swatched a
bunch of different ultra matte lips on
my arm that were in like the same color
family like very mod shades you know
everyday wearable shades and Lumiere 2
stands out to me I don't think they have
another color that's similar the only
thing I can think of that's a little bit
similar is trapped but it's much much
much more cool tone and beeper as well
but again it has more cool tones in it
I think they never had the intention of
creating a liquid lipstick version of
Lumiere just so that they wouldn't like
offend me or something they probably did
that so that Lumiere can be its own
specific color but since you know this
one is Lumiere - it's okay I think it's
beautiful I know I'm biased about it
because Lumiere is my baby but I love
Lumiere too and I hope you do as well
and I want to address something really
quick um 2016 is gonna be up hopefully
you know God willing 2016 is gonna be
it's gonna be a wild ride in terms of
brands that I'm collabing with I have
some projects in the future this year I
have things that I'm working on and I
don't care what anybody tells me like oh
my gosh you're like a collab whore like
I don't care what anybody tells me I'm
living my dream and I'm doing something
that makes me happy and working with
companies that I truly believe in like
color pop and Oprah like those are
companies I love and I love the people
behind the company I love doing what I
do so I love creating colors and doing
things like that so I'm gonna continue
to do things that make me happy and I
encourage you to do the same do what
makes you happy and who cares what
anybody else things you know it's taken
me kind of a long time to realize that I
need to please myself because I'm a
people pleaser Danny calls me the yes
girl and he's always telling he's like
your yes girl you you can't tell people
no and I kind of got to the point where
I realized everybody has their own life
and they make their own decisions and
they do things that make them happy and
I should do the same so for those of you
who do support me on these journeys I've
been on thank you so
much I say it in every video pretty much

do appreciate it and this launch is for
