a chatty video I'm just gonna sit here
and hang out with you guys and it's
gonna be a first impression when I
recently did a chatty get ready video I
asked you guys if you wanted to see a
first impressions on the new mole not
new anymore
cover FX custom enhancer drops and a ton
of you guys said you did want to see
this video I keep them displayed on my
shelves here and I haven't played around
with them I've only swatched them I
haven't tried them on my face so I
thought it would be a good idea to just
use them on camera for the first time
and just tell you my thoughts I know
like a million people have already
uploaded a video like this but you guys
wanted to see it so here we are okay so
I'm just gonna go ahead and get started
I already have my face primed and my
eyebrows on as usual I want to try
mixing this in with foundation these are
basically liquid highlights they're like
liquid metal it's so insane there are
two colors that are not like
highlighting they're a little bit more
of like bronzers so I just pulled these
up on the Sephora website so that I can
explain what they are to you it says
it's a drop formula which it is it comes
in like this these little droppers and
it's for highlighting strobing and
bronzing mix it with any beauty product
or use alone the only thing I will say
is that you get 0.5 fluid ounces which
is like half of a foundation and it's
$42 like tant a suspense but if I'm
gonna be completely honest I've never
seen anything like this so I do think
its innovative I think it's cool its
unique and if I do love it it might be
worth the money I would have preferred
them to drop it like ten dollars because
it is point five fluid ounces but it is
a high-end brand coverfx is a great
great great brand let me take my hair
out of my face I'm going to show you
guys swatches really quick so this first
one is called celestial and this is the
lightest one in the collection it's
literally it looks like liquid silver it
has a little bit of pink in it this
would be perfect for very fair porcelain
skin tones then we have the shade
moonlight which by swatching it looks
like this one would be my favorite
because it has a little bit of pink but
then there's a little bit of gold in
there too and then we have the shade
sunlight which
is kind of similar to moonlight more
gold definitely if you are someone who
likes a more gold sheen on the face
sunlight is your guy and then this one
right here is called candlelight which
is perfect for those of you with really
deep skin tones this would reflect so
pretty on your skin too dark for me but
so glad that they included a shade like
this and then there are these two colors
right here which are more of like the
bronzing colors this one is lighter it's
called sunkissed this is the one I'm
probably going to use to try to bronze
up my skin today I feel like it's more
cool toned than the other one
really really gorgeous color and then
this one is darker it's called sunset
perfect for those of you with a deeper
skin tone to bronze up your face really
really nice so excited to use these you
have no idea okay so I'm going to take
my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation is in the shade Y
305 and I'm gonna pull this pump two
pumps I'm gonna do two pumps on the back
of my hand and I'm gonna mix in one of
these enhancer drops I think I'm gonna
use the golden shade sunlight I'm just
gonna drop like a very little bit of D
okay I did one drop I don't know if
that's too little let's see let me mix
it I didn't bring anything to mix it
with I just so mix it with my finger
that really didn't do much so I'm gonna
take a little bit more boom and then I'm
just going to apply this to my face I
want to see if this gives like a
noticeable glow because the Ultra HD on
my skin it's kind of like a more natural
finish so maybe this will actually make
a difference
my lips are so dry
oh my whoops I haven't been wearing lip
balm before bed I don't know what's
wrong with me and then every time I wake
up in the morning I'm like this might be
a little too dark for me and Nick is
paler but see how my my arms are darker
this area always throws me off okay so
that is my face with the foundational I
don't know if you can tell but if I look
really really closely at my skin there's
kind of like specks of shimmer
throughout my skin but not like really
ugly shimmer it's if you look really
closely it gave it kind of like a very
subtle glow like if I turn my head can
you tell my eyebrows huh oh yeah my
eyebrows I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
concealer I'm just going to use my
liquid camouflage high coverage
concealer by Catrice
I get a lot of questions as to why that
frame is lower than the other frames but
it's actually because I have like a
collage happening there and they're all
like different they're all at different
levels random side note okay so now to
bronze my skin I want to try one of
these bronzy shades so I'm gonna take
Sunkist I don't know I guess I put it on
the back of my hand and then try it like
that so I'm just going oh but I think I
was too much whoopsie first impressions
I love them this is a sponge from the
brand pure and I'm just gonna dip my
sponge into it that way and then warm up
the skin like that
which seems to be working perfectly fine
this way and then I'm going to squeeze
my sponge like this and then try to like
contour with this not contour but you
know what I mean
nice actually it looks pretty freakin
good
you know what I like about this what I
noticed immediately this does not affect
the formula of the product underneath
sometimes liquid bronzers cream bronzers
when you try to apply them on top of
your foundation have you ever noticed
that sometimes your foundation will kind
of like come up and blotch up and kind
of get a little bit patchy because
you're trying to layer another cream
product on top this doesn't do that it
just blends right into the skin wow that
is so pretty well I really like that I
actually brought my butter bronzer to
kind of set that down but I feel like I
don't need to set it I am so into this I
actually really really like this so
forth okay so now I'm just going to
apply my blush I'm going to take my rose
champagne blush by wet and wild and I'm
just going to apply this to my cheeks
this is a Sonia Kashuk blush brush I'm
also doing this because I want to see
how this um this product lays on top of
powder so I just put down a powder blush
now when I go in with the highlight on
the tops of my cheekbones I want to see
if it works well or if it's something
that you have to use before you go in
with blush okay so for highlight I think
I'm gonna go ahead and use moonlight and
I'm just gonna put some on the back of
my hand a little go such a long way I
feel like yeah you get point five
product but I mean look at that I just
put like one little glob and look at
this it's insane I don't know what to
apply this with I'm actually gonna try
it with a brush instead of my sponge I'm
gonna use the Real Techniques setting
brush let's see if this works
actually I feel like that might not work
actually I'm not gonna do it I'm just
gonna
oh that is looking really patchy right
there I did not notice how fast that
dried I think that's why I got a little
patchy because I just let it sit on my
hand so let me try blending that in
immediately with my finger okay it's
looking better now so first impression
definitely do not let this sit on your
hand because it will dry and then it
will go on in chunks yeah
I love nose highlight forever some
people don't I personally do this side
definitely looks better than this side
because I let it dry before I went on
this one oh man I guess that's what
first impressions are for right to see
mistakes and to never do them again this
one right here is so pretty and it's
actually layering really nice on top of
that powder I mean I didn't put blush on
my cheekbones here but that looks so
pretty and that actually can look really
natural I'm actually gonna see if any of
these would work on the eyes kind of as
a liquid eye shadow I'm a little bit
nervous I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna try
I'm just I know I'm sorry I I can't stop
using it I'm gonna do a little bit of an
eye shadow look really quick with the
Anastacio modern renaissance palette
okay so I added a warm taupe in my
crease and then I went in with blonde
fresco right here and I put this pretty
much everywhere except right in the
center I want to try to do a halo eye
with one of these things and then I did
some more crease work and I added raw
Sienna and then I did a Vermeer in my
inner corners I'm gonna add a little bit
of celestial this is like the really
light shade right here and I'm gonna see
how this looks kind of like in the
center
just going to let that dry for a second
and then I'm going to do another layer
okay so I look a little crazy right now
I'm going to let them dry for a second
and then go in and try to blend things
okay so I just finished my makeup I just
added some mascara and I apply my lip
color this is Alyssa from my new color
pop collection releasing July 12 I don't
know when this video go up but this
would be available internationally July
12 so my overall thoughts is that I give
this product a huge thumbs up I love how
easy it is to apply with your fingers
like you don't need to use anything else
it doesn't look splotchy when you use
your fingers I'm obsessed with the shade
sunkissed this is such a pretty bronzer
and it was incredibly easy to blend out
this highlight shade I'm wearing is
called moonlight and it's a really
stunning color the consistency on these
are amazing they're phenomenal I think
they are really great because they just
mesh well with other formulas like it
looked nice on top of foundation and I
kind of like this as eyeshadow it's not
something I would typically use but once
they dry down completely they look nice
and they won't transfer when I first put
this on it was kind of transferring into
my crease like when I would open my eyes
and my lid would touch my crease it did
transfer automatically so you want to
make sure that if you do use this kind
of like a halo eye you have to like
leave your eyes kind of open and then
wait for it to dry but with that being
said because they transfer so easily I
was able to just apply a little bit of
color in my crease and then it went away
like it blended away my cons I will say
that you cannot apply this like I have a
splotchy little spot right here I had
put it on the back of my hand and I
waited a few seconds and then I went in
with my fingers or with a sponge or
whatever and it just it didn't work I
had to open this touch it with my
fingers and then go in like that and
then it applied really really
beautifully and another con is the price
these are ridiculously priced I will say
find a color that you really love and
buy one and it should last you a really
long time but besides the price and
those other things I mentioned I think
this is a great great product I wonder
how this would look kind of like dusted
on my lipstick oh let's try I'm going to
take a little bit of celestial with this
Sephora Pro airbrush concealer number 57
cool it kind of created a little bit of
an ombre lip nice alright
I totally have used this in every way
you could probably possibly use this a
plus for me leave me a comment down
below if you've tried this if you'd like
these if you don't like these let's talk
about them in the comments thank you
