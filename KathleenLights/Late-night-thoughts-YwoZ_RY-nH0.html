midnight this video is actually a
different video and it's something that
I wasn't gonna do but it has been
bothering me for like the last 20
minutes and I feel like I need to sit
down and talk about it so because of the
amount of subscribers I get I noticed
that like the more my channel grows the
more criticism I get and not like
constructive criticism like criticism
about Who I am as a person
sometimes youtubers will get mad when
someone posts like if your video is too
dark or your eyebrows are too big or
which I get that a lot and things like
that and that doesn't bother me that's a
normal opinion that is someone thinks my
eyebrows are too thick that's okay you
can say that that doesn't bother me or
when someone tells me that I need to fix
a certain thing in my video that doing
the same looks over and over like it
looks are getting boring like things
like that don't offend me cuz that's
people honestly at the end of the day
just giving constructive criticism but
what bothers me is people judging me for
who I am or who they think I am recently
yesterday
Jacqueline hell uploaded a new video and
I commented on the video like I do so
many other youtubers that I comment on
their videos cuz all I do is watch
youtube videos it's my hobby it's what I
like to do it kind of like these
stresses mean I sit at home and I watch
YouTube videos and just like people
comment on my videos I like to comment
on other videos as well so I commented a
comment on Jacqueline Hills video which
I now deleted but I said something nice
I was like oh I like your video or I
don't remember what I said and it had
like 75 comments underneath it started
with someone saying that I comment on
bigger youtubers to try to get to bigger
which I thought was pretty ridiculous
because I comment on so many youtubers
people with less subscribers people with
more subscribers like I have youtubers
who are friends who can vouch for that
I'm constantly commenting if I like your
channel it doesn't matter if you have 5
subscribers or 5 million I'm going to
show my support because I like your
channel
and then after that comment people just
started like attacking and it was funny
until it was funny until I read a
comment making fun of my anxiety I read
that I that I just pretend to be a
humble positive person and that I'm
really self-absorbed trying to just get
ahead and just trying to surpass people
and just be number one this person
literally was saying that every time I
say positive things and I tell people to
be positive that I'm crazy that maybe I
need to see a psychologist because maybe
I have a personality disorder where I
think I'm a humble human being but I'm
not because when someone starts to tear
me down as a human being that upsets me
I recently did a video where I shouted
out to like um smaller channels like I
gave them a shout out to help their
channel grow and someone said it was
rude that I said that they just heard
that they deserved more subscribers
saying that oh these people deserve more
subscribers that person said that was
rude and it made me seem like I was
above them if that's how I came off I
really wasn't trying to come off that
way
I literally meant they they just
deserves more subscribers
they were both hard-working women who do
a lot further channel and I wanted them
to have more subscribers I can't be
nice I can't be anything without someone
jumping down my throat and don't get me
wrong I put myself on YouTube I put
myself in that position you know I'm on
YouTube it's a public thing people can
say what they want to say I'm not asking
people to not express themselves
I'm just asking people to think before
you express yourself you don't know who
you're hurting when you say the things
you say and I'm not sitting here so that
people can feel sorry for me I don't
know I don't want you to feel sorry for
me I don't want any pity from anyone I'm
just here to tell people to relax it
really is the simplest thing in the
world but if you have nothing nice to
say don't say anything at all unless
it's constructive criticism talk
about my hair talk about my
eyebrows talk about whatever you
want but not Who I am
I don't get it we see stories all the
time about like suicide people kill
themselves for being bullied like
depression there's so many things that
can take place just by telling people
mean things over and over again that I
don't know why society continues to do
it don't get me wrong most of the time
this slides right off my back and I read
the comments and I laugh with Danny and
I laugh with my sister being on YouTube
has made me a lot stronger um two years
ago I probably would have just been like
forget it I'm not doing you dip anymore
I'm content with who I am as an
individual and I feel like people who
try to hurt others with their words
they're sad and sometimes I feel like
okay maybe I shouldn't be upset that
someone is telling me that maybe I
should try to understand why that person
is telling me that you know I try I try
to better myself every day and I try to
understand why people why some people
are hateful but you know what I'm a
human being and sometimes it gets to me
I got a comment on Twitter earlier today
telling me to just focus on the positive
like completely stop focusing on the
negative because the negative negativity
surrounds you which I agree 100%
if you focus your life on negativity
like that's all you're gonna get and I
am very very very sure with who I am as
a person so the fact that those comments
like that spread of comments got to me
today just kind of pissed me off that I
let it get to me it's like if I try to
defend myself I'm evil or if I even talk
about it I'm being negative and I'm not
I don't want to turn this video into a
long thing I'm kind of like rambling now
I'm talking about nothing I just want to
put this video on the Internet to tell
people if something inside of you wants
to tell somebody something really mean
think twice before you do it because
words hurt more than you think that they
do you guys you only see 10 minutes of
my life three times a week 10 to 20
minute videos of my life where I'm
talking about makeup and I'm happy and
I'm like goofy and bubbly but I'm a
person and reading that thread today
where people assumed so many
things about me that I was just this
horrible person and that I'm like all
these things and I'm like how would you
even know that you don't know me just
try to be nicer and this isn't for
ninety five percent of you because I'm
not gonna lie like ninety five percent
of you are amazing you know what I'm
going to talk about you guys really
quick I want to thank you because even
though I was said earlier today
there were so many of you who were
defending me in like a nice way cuz
sometimes I feel like some people could
defend others and get a just as
aggressive as them and become just as a
just as negative as the person saying
something I want to thank you guys cuz
sometimes people focus too much on the
negative and they don't focus on the
positive and I don't want to be that
person so thank you guys cuz I get love
on a daily basis from all of you and I
feel like no matter how many hate
comments I get I will continue to do
this because of you guys for you guys
who watch my videos and comment sweet
things I feel like I've created a bond
with so many of you and even though it's
so hard for me to comment back to every
single person you know I appreciate
every single person who comments I love
all of you you guys are so sweet and you
mean the world to me and sometimes I
feel like I don't say that enough but
you do I feel like I'm a happier person
because of you guys I'm a better person
because of you guys I'm a stronger
person I'm happier and I owe it to all
of you who tell me nice things and who
watch and like my videos and even though
they're stupid makeup videos like you
guys are so sweet and I love you all
from the bottom of my heart and have the
I have the best subscribers out there
like I have the best subscribers I'm
pretty sure that all the good
subscribers are mine I love you guys so
much and I wish every single one of you
happiness and health especially health
um and just good things and remember to
spread positivity and don't let anybody
try to bring you down as an individual
I've always been a pretty positive
person but starting my channel made me
become an even more positive person and
I like Who I am and I like who I become
and I don't care if people tell me
things because I have the support of all
of you but I just I just wanted to come
out here and you know talk about how I
felt earlier so yeah I'm gonna end this
video porter is like right to go to bed
look at him look at his sleepy face like
that's a sleepy face
what does the sleepy face you won't even
kiss me are you sleepy Oh was it
oh yeah does it kiss okay so I'm gonna
end this video by telling you guys be
nice and be kind because kindness is
very important and kindness will take
you far love you guys

being my number one supporters for being
my number one friends I love you bye
