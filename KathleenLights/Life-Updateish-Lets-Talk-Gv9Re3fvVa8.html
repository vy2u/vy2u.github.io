going this is gonna annoy me it's gonna
annoy so I wanted to sit down and make a
video kind of just talking to you guys
about things that have been happening
recently and I thought to myself okay
good put on some makeup and the iron
your hair or something and then make the
video and then I thought no no I'm gonna
make the video just like this by the way
a side note a lot of you guys who follow
me on snapchat know that I had to shave
Porter because his knots were so bad so
bad and I always take Cornelius with
Porter I get the hair done at Petsmart I
don't really love how they do it but
it's the only thing that's closest to me
right now and Cornelius did not have one
knot in his hair not one he has
beautiful luscious untangled beautiful
hair and I was like okay Oh Selena
Selena right now not right now Celine
never now and alright alright and then
when I picked up cray Leah
ahh when I picked up Cornelius at
Petsmart I was so upset
look at him he's shamed he is he's
pretty much shaved the what this is not
a Yorkie that what is this
I always tell Cornelius or the people
that Petsmart I was like I'm always like
okay a Westie cut I always tell him
because my dream is to have a Westie so
I live vicariously through his haircut
and a Westie cut is short up top but the
sides stay long
what is this they cut off all of his
sides I was so upset but I'm just hyper
I don't like confrontation so I was like
thank you they were like you like it I'm
like yeah buy it paid and I left and
then I was just like ah so upset in the
car Danny's like why don't you say
anything and I'm like be good oh I have
to wait for Karina his hair to grow and
if you want to see Porter look at that
look at this oh my god crazy looks
I never thought his ears were this big
like oh my gosh okay now back to the
actual video I've been sitting here for
3 minutes talking crap so I wanted to
talk to you guys about certain things I
just woke up
my face is like red hold on I need my
coffee you mic Wafi Oh didn't notice my
mirror was there I don't even like how
they cut your face how is that a Westie
face I'm still beautiful
so I confused a lot of people in my last
video in my last video I told you guys
that I was going to do a lot of look
books I was going to I'm going to be
including fashion in my videos in the
near future like outfit videos after the
days look books followed books when
chocolate books spring loaded some are
like what I'm gonna do all those things
I want to mesh my beauty and my not my
beauty I mean my beauty channel and
fashion I want to mesh them together so
in the video I was like but I can't be
doing that for a while and I'll tell you
guys in another video cuz a lot of big
changes are happening and I didn't put
two and two together that was totally my
fault a lot of you guys were like oh my
god are you pregnant
and it just hit me when I was ready to
comment so I'm like of course people are
gonna think I'm pregnant I can't see
fashion videos cuz big changes are
happening I'm such a I'm dumb but no
guys I am not pregnant I warded that so
terribly I was actually telling Danny I
was like that was my bed a lot of you
guys have been noticing in recent videos
that I'm just not myself that I'm not
bubbly like I usually am that I'm just
like kind of sad and I'm not sad but I
have been extremely stressed which I'll
get into now in a second but um so a lot
of you guys also thought that I was
getting divorced like that was the
changes but no I'm not get I'm not
getting divorced no no no no there
hasn't even been bloops in my videos in
a really long time because okay this is
the thing I can't exactly tell you what
changes are happening right the second I
just I can't right now and I really wish
I could but it's not set in stone yet
it's not something that's happening
tomorrow it's not something that I I'm
at liberty to talk about because it's
not 100% for sure I still don't know
what I'm gonna do I still don't know it
has nothing to do with a collab it has
nothing to do with a business it has
nothing to do with kathleenlights it has
to do with my life like my Cathleen
Fuentes my
life so that's why I just can't update
you guys yet but I will I will 100% you
will be hearing about what's happening
the first week of October I know it's a
really long time from now but it will be
like the first week of October where I
will sit down and tell you guys
everything and with that being said I
cannot film for a whole month
I cannot film during the month of
October because of the changes because
of so many things that I have to do I
have been so busy so incredibly busy and
just like I said so many things are
happening that I won't be able to film
that month but but this is also why
there hasn't been bloops in my videos or
why I'm not like it's not unusual to be
loved and all my I never do that in my
videos but you know I mean I'm not like
woo in my videos recently because for
the past like two weeks I have been
filming every single day two videos a
day I have just been working myself to
the bone every day non-stop even on the
weekends which I usually like don't film
on the weekends I'll hang out with Danny
and we'll like watch movies and stuff
but I've been filming like a madwoman so
that I can have a whole months worth of
pre-recorded videos now it seems intense
but I'm only gonna be posting two videos
a week in the month of October which is
I hate that because you guys know I like
to post three videos a week but for
October it's only going to be two videos
a week I post Mondays Wednesdays and
Fridays and only in October though from
October 1st to the very last day to
Halloween I'll be posting Mondays and
Wednesdays and ho and then in November I
should be back to sitting down and
filming three times a week I didn't want
to just go I could have just like not
filmed in October and I'm sure you guys
wouldn't have mind me taking like a
month break or maybe you would have um
but I still want content to be put up so
with that being said I did you want to
see how crazy my hair is so like I said
with that being said I did dye me roots
um
this past weekend and since for the
whole two weeks before this past weekend
I was pre recording all of my videos I
will have like my black roots again so
if you're watching my videos and you're
like how why are her roots like so
intense if she already died her roots
that's why because those videos are
pre-recorded I still have all this week
to pre-record like this whole week I'm
recording
videos for you guys and those videos
will go up in October as well so some
videos will have my roots nice and died
and some videos won't I am going to try
my best to find a way to film in October
whether it's the last thing I do that is
my goal to find a way to film even
though I can't go find a way but um I
just wanted to let you guys know that no
I'm not sad it's just the things that
have been happening have been stressing
me so bad but I get really bad anxiety
I've had like panic attacks because of
so many changes um if you know me
personally I'm not a big fan of change I
mean I think change is good don't get me
wrong I think change is good I think we
all need change every once in a while
but I'm not someone who can adapt to
change very easily it's not my favorite
thing to do so the fact that I know that
so many things are changing here in
about two months it's been giving me a
panic attack that's been giving me
anxiety it's been stressing me out it's
been making me sad it's making me happy
it's been making me shaky it's like I
have so many emotions that I can't
control right now that that's why in my
videos I just I'm a little bit different
but that's gonna go back to normal as
soon as things settle I know I'm not
making any sense right now but stay
tuned the first week of October I will
tell you guys everything but don't worry
guys I am okay I'm just a little bit
I've had anxiety really bad anxiety this
whole month of August and September so
far so please bear with me through the
pre-recording the proportion of my
videos pre-record I made that up Raina
bear with me in October which sucks
because it's like fall time and I love
filming in October but don't worry I am
pre recording fall looks for you guys
don't worry but at least I'll be
recording in November and Christmas and
all that stuff January my birthday
because I really like filming in the
winter time I like it and like
Thanksgiving ease down I'm already
getting off topic okay so yeah I just
want to sit down even though I'm pretty
much didn't update you at all because I
didn't tell you guys what what exactly
is happening I just wanted to clear the
air of certain things that you guys
thought was happening and
I just wanted to tell you guys about the
pre-recording of I just wanted to talk
