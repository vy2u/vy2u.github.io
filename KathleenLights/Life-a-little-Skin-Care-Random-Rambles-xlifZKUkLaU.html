gonna be another random rambles welcome
to another vlog so I feel like I have so
many things to tell you guys first of
all my Invisalign is in ignore that but
I wanted to sit down with you guys and
talk about YouTube for a second before I
get on with my day so you guys know I
post three videos three times a week and
most of the time I'm always on schedule
I always have hiccups here and there but
that's normal that's life and that's
kind of what I wanted to talk about
today
you know I post these videos and you
guys get like 15 minutes of my life
and all I'm talking about is beauty and
makeup and you guys don't really see
much of the personal side of me so you
don't really know what's going on behind
the scenes and recently there's just
been a lot a lot going on and I just
find myself making videos like this so
often I feel like I was apologizing in a
video a month ago you know things have
gotten so rocky with my channel mainly
about the time like I'll still post
three times a week but I'll find myself
posting them sporadically throughout the
day like I posted in Monday's video at
11:30 p.m.
almost Tuesday and I almost feel like
they're just gonna get rockier
especially for April and May I just kind
of want to tell you guys what's going on
there's so much coming up for me in
April and in May I'm gonna be doing a
lot of traveling which I'm very very
grateful for I'm very blessed I never
want to sound like I'm not grateful for
the opportunities and for the job in the
career I have but when you live in this
brain this one it can get a little bit
intense
I have really horrible anxiety I've
spoken about it on my channel before I
hate getting on airplanes I don't think
it gets any easier for me I hate
traveling but in April and May I'm gonna
be doing a lot of it mainly for work and
these two months coming up I can't
exactly talk about it yet but I do have
to travel a lot for my job and it's it's
something I have to accept I have to do
I have to toughen up I try to do little
remedies here and there to help with my
anxiety or to help with my fear of
flying but I just know it's gonna be a
really tough two months for me mentally
and I just really have to push through
it because I don't ever want to get to a
point where my anxiety is beating me I
just want to get out of it and I feel
like the only way to do that is to
continue to try and thrive and to try to
you know push through and keep going
with my career so I have so much coming
up and
in the back of my mind I just know I'm
gonna piss off so many people in in
these two months I don't want to
disappoint anybody and I don't want to
slack off on YouTube but I have so much
pre recording to do and then I have to
edit all those videos and I'm gonna be
gone for weeks at a time and I just I
don't know how I'm gonna do it I
honestly I don't know how I'm gonna do
it but I look at these other youtubers
who post like every single day and I'm
like how do you do it have to work
harder I just have to do better I guess
but please bear with me I know I'm
always constantly apologizing you guys
are probably rolling your eyes so hard
right now but YouTube to me is where I
go and I relieve my stress where I get
to talk to you guys and do things that
are fun like do my makeup tutorials you
know things that are fun for me that
take away my everyday stresses and kind
of take me out of reality and I never
want to get to a point where YouTube is
a burden or if you're like oh I have to
upload a video now or where I'm unhappy
because honestly I haven't gotten to
that point I love YouTube I love what I
do I honestly never thought balancing
everything would be so hard obviously
I'm not very good at multitasking but
guys I swear I feel it I feel it right
here like on my finger trips I am so
close to creating a base coat for kale
polish I have been um working on a base
coat and a top coat since I started kale
polish since the original six colors
came out I have been working on those
two products and nothing is good enough
and I know that that sounds like we're
really nothing is good enough the thing
is that kale polish you don't use a lot
of harsh chemicals in our products
that's why a lot of pregnant women use
kale polish a lot of kids but a lot of
base coats that keep your nail polish on
all day and a lot of top coats that
really prolong your wear are not seven
free and after like two years I feel
like I'm almost there
I feel so confident about the base coat
situation and and the top coat situation
you might read it might reach my
standards I don't know but those are
things I'm working on right now also a
lot more behind the scenes things a lot
of stuff is going down in the next two
months that I have to travel for so my
channel might be a little rocky and I
don't want to feel bad for that you know
to focus on my mental health we all need
to focus on our mental health if any of
you are watching this right now and
you're really stressed I don't know what
you can do to help that because honestly
I'm on that same journey but self-love
is so important
you can to eliminate some stress and I
hope it works for you I'll let you know
how it goes for me but anyway I wanted
to tell you that just so you guys can
have a warning I might be doing more
random rambles just to fill up gaps just
in the meantime today I'm actually gonna
phone a video right now because I'm
trying to preview a course I'm gonna
film a full face of Milani makeup I
wanted to like a Milani glam look and
then I actually come back on here and
I'm gonna do a base mask because I got a
lot of questions about my steamer on my
Instagram story so much shame I see
where I'm gonna do a little face mask
I'm going to show you like my at-home
facial because I've been breaking out
here in this area and I don't know what
it is and I've been using a lot of new
products recently so I'm like I don't
know it has to be like a base product I
think do you like me sure I'm obsessed
with it growing up Sailor Moon was my
life I used to be obsessed with saving
Jupiter she had brown hair and green
eyes and growing up I wanted to be just
like her so she was my favorite anyway I
actually just got a package in the mail
that I want to show you guys cuz I was
like what he's right and also remember
that time I told you in a random rambles
video that I bought that rainbow
holographic thing that I was gonna stick
on to my window in the bathroom I
finally did that myself actually just
did like a square cut out I didn't do
the whole top piece because I was afraid
it was gonna be too rain buoy which it
is I mean it's not to rain buoy but it
has a lot of rainbows it looks so cool
it's really only during the morning I
would say like around 11 p.m. the rate
bonus goes away because the Sun isn't
blazing through that window
and it looks so intense already with
just a little piece I put but I think if
I put a longer piece my entire bathroom
is gonna be filled with rainbows which I
think that's exactly what I'm gonna do
and it honestly instantly puts me in a
good mood I'm gonna try my best to find
it on Amazon I doubt it because I tried
to look for it already and I couldn't
find it but I'm gonna do my best
or at least I'm gonna try to look for
something similar but yeah let me know
sorry that package I just got ok so I
don't know what's wrong with the audio
in this clip but basically you gotta do
a voiceover really quick I got this
package from Drive cosmetics with these
beautiful flowers and my name written
across like in balloons and I thought it
was so nice
sent me a little note and I just thought
that was so nice and sweet that I would
did not expect a package like that at
all when I first thought I was like my
birthday who is sending me balloons and
then I read the drive Cosmetics card and
they are so so sweet and I'm pretty sure
I cannot talk about that but they sent
me a sneak peek of a product that's
gonna be launching in the summer and I
can't wait to test it out I am so
impressed with their products time and
time again I have purchased so many of
their products and they've also sent me
quite a few and yeah I really really
loved them if you I'm gonna do like a
full face using Drive cosmetics I would
love to do that but anyway I'm gonna go
film an actual beauty video now but I'm
gonna come back and show you guys how I
do my facials at home hello guys I'm
back in my bathroom oh my god there's a
mosquito in here I filmed a full face
using Milani makeup but I filmed it like
seven hours ago just kidding what kind
of it it's 8 p.m. and I filmed this
video at 2 o'clock so I've had this
makeup on for 6 hours and I feel like
it's looking pretty freaking good for
being on for 6 hours Milani is doing it
right look at that highlight six hours
later I know this is a weird angle but
I'm just gonna go with it but I thought
you know what why don't I just get
unready with you guys because I want to
show you guys how I do a facial with
that guy right there can you guys not
fight over toys thank you very much
well I'm gonna do a clay mask because I
feel like my clogs my clogs my pores are
really clogged and I just wanted to in
your mask before I sit down to edit this
video and then go to bed so let's do
that
okay and now I basically just wait until
this face mask dries and then I just
wash it off and this face mask is so
intense it's like really really powerful
it just sucks the life out of your pores
and I basically just keep this on for
about 10 minutes not that long and then
I'll just wash my entire face and I'll
apply either my night time moisturizer
or a face mask today I'm just gonna do
my nighttime moisturizer cuz I'm just
gonna edit my video and then go to bed
but I've been trying out this summer
fridays jetlag mask that everybody has
been loving and raving about and the
first time I used it I was so blown away
my skin looked amazing but now I feel
like this might be what's breaking me
out I don't know there's just so many
things that might be breaking me out I
don't know but this did leave my skin
feeling so hydrated and smooth and dude
I used an eyeliner today from Milani
that was really old it was a liquid
liner because it was the only Milani
liquid liner I had and it irritated my
eyes so much I kept itching my eyes the
entire day and I feel like my eyes look
so irritated like here yeah
do not wear expired makeup but anyway
I'm just gonna end this video here I
hope you guys had a really amazing
Easter I actually had a great Easter I
had an Easter party at Danny's dad's
house because Easter happened to land on
April Fool's this year and April Fool's
Day is actually Danny's dad's birthday
he was born April 1st so I did kind of
like an Easter sesh birthday party at
his house and it was so funny we have an
Easter egg hunt we had potato sack races
three-legged races we had like a kid
version and an adult version I'm trying
not to laugh with this face mask on but
it was hilarious both the kids and the
adults were so funny I'm gonna enter a
clip so you can see
yeah I hope you guys have an amazing
Easter if you celebrate it I love you
guys I hope this video wasn't too boring
don't forget to leave me requests down
