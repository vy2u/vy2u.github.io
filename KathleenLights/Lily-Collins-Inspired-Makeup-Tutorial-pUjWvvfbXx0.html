tutorial on this look it's actually
really really simple so like two days
ago I was on Twitter and Lancome tweeted
a picture of Lily Collins and it is this
one right here and she's one of my
favorite favorite celebrity crushes like
she is beautiful she's top five for me I
love I obsessed over Lily Collins I try
to get my eyebrows to look like hers all
the time and I thought that she looked
so stunning and it was the most simplest
makeup look ever it was just blue
eyeliner and like a peachy nude lip and
the rest of her face was just really
really soft so I wanted to recreate it
today just because it's an everyday look
with just a little bit of a twist since
it's blue eyeliner I actually don't have
blue eyeliner so I used the blue in my
electric palette but if you have a
makeup geeks blue eyeliner that would
work perfectly I just don't have that
but yes I really actually loved how it
turned out like I love it it's so basic
but pretty at the same time I really
like it so if you want to see this Lily
Collins inspired makeup look then just
keep watching so I'm starting off with
her eyebrows you guys know Lily Collins
has really really bold eyebrows so that
is the look I'm going for I decided to
bring my eyebrows a little bit closer
together because her gap like in between
her eyebrows isn't as big as mine so I
made mine a little bit longer in the
front so yes I'm just thickening up my
eyebrows as I usually do because Lily
Collins is total eyebrow Envy but you
know just filling them in thicker than
usual I guess now I'm going to move on
to my face I'm going to use the NYX
angel veil primer to prime my face and
then I'm going in with the healthy skin
healthy skin no the Bourjois healthy mix
serum foundation in 52
this is a Sephora Pro collection brush I
believe it's number 50 or number 20 but
it's just in like limited edition
packaging with the cute little flowers
on it so I'm just buffing a light layer
onto my skin now I'm going to move on to
concealer this is the Maybelline better
skin concealer and I'm applying that
underneath my eyes to cover up my dark
circles and I'm also using this on my
eyelids to prime my eyelids as well
and I'm just going to go ahead and blend
all that in i didn't highlight the rest
of my face because lily doesn't have
like a super contoured highlighted kind
of face going on everything is just
really really soft so i just applied it
underneath my eyes and then i'm going to
set that using the Maybelline fit me
powder in 1/35 creamy natural setting my
eyelids first so that they don't crease
and then setting my concealer underneath
my eyes as well okay so now I'm going to
go ahead and do my eye makeup I'm going
to use this cobble bronzer by girl
lactic and I'm just lightly dusting that
onto my eyelids because in the photo it
doesn't look like she has anything on
her eyelids but it doesn't look bare
either I don't know how to explain it it
looks like there's a little something so
I'm taking max all that glitters eyes
shadow and I'm just lightly dusting that
on my lid lily has blue eyeliner pretty
much everywhere on her waterline and
tightline so that is what I'm doing with
Urban Decay's chaos eyeliner and then
I'm going to take the Urban Decay
electric palette and dip this little
angled brush into chaos eyes shadow
they're both the exact same color and I
am just putting that on my lower lashes
to set the eyeliner just to make it a
little bit more intense and then I'm
gonna do the same thing to my lid like
close to my lash line I'm gonna pretend
this eyeshadow is an eyeliner like a gel
liner and I'm just going back and forth
into that eye shadow and creating a
little wing just as if it were like a
gel eyeliner so yes I'm just packing
that on I've just made a little wing
super easy and then I just applied a ton
of roller lash mascara by benefit she
looks like she has a very natural wispy
lash I'm sure they're falsies but I just
decided to go and pack on that mascara
so she doesn't look very highlighted
like I said very sculpted so I'm just
using my hourglass luminous light powder
and I'm just pretty much testing that
everywhere cuz she has a soft glow but
like on her whole face
now I'm going to contour a little bit
she definitely does have like spoke to
cheekbones in the picture but it's not
super intense so I'm taking the girl
lactic bronzer in Kabul and I'm just
going to lightly contour my face I'm
also going to bring this on my forehead
just to bronze up a little bit she
looked like she had a very defined nose
in the picture like if her nose was
contoured so I don't typically do this
but I'm just contouring my nose a little
bit and for blush I'm using NARS madly
because her cheeks were very very soft
like a soft peach almost I don't know it
almost looked like she didn't have any
blush on so I thought that this blush
would be perfect now I'm going to move
on to the lips you had a beautiful
peachy nude I'm going to take this
Jordana lipliner I believe it's called
rose crush but I'll leave it down below
I'm going to fill my entire lips with it
and then I'm going to go over with Too
Faced naked dolly lipstick and then that
completes this makeup look I really hope
