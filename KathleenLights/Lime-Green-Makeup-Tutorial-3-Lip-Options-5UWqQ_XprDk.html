tutorial on the look on my face right
now it's very very bold very dramatic
but it is really really easy to do I
feel like I say that in a lot of my
videos like this look is so easy but
that's what my looks are easy even
though they look crazy sometimes they're
very easy
I was actually totally inspired by this
picture I bought I actually bought this
on a website called society6 I think
that's what it's called and I was
looking at it today because I was about
to hang it up and I was like wait a
minute like I wanted to do a pop of
color but I wanted to make it like
pretty much the whole lid and like
nothing else to it so this is what I
came up with I gave you guys three lip
options this is like the third lip
option I feel like even though the eyes
are insane it can go with so many
different lip colors if you are willing
to experiment and be a little bit bold I
really like this look personally for me
I would have done absolutely no false
lashes like I would have just packed on
the mascara but you guys know I lost a
lot of my lashes on my left eye and it
just looked weird with just mascara
alone popped on the lashes and I thought
with this kind of look because there's
no eyeliner I feel like the bolder the
lash the better I think it looks cool
with the whole like intense neon color
so yes enough rambling if you want to
see how to get this colorful look then
just keep watching so I'm going to start
by priming my lids with the Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion in the shade
enigma and I'm just blending that on my
entire lid the first shade I'm taking is
this one by makeup geek it's in the
shade Fuji and I'm just going to buff
that into my crease with a fluffy crease
brush then I'm going to take this
eyeshadow by morphe it's called
sunflower and I'm just going to buff
that into my crease as well
now I'm going to take the melt cosmetics
radioactive stack and I'm going to take
the yellow shade in the stack and I
believe this one is called neon and I'm
just pretty much doing the exact same
thing buffing colors into the crease now
for my lid shade I'm taking the melts
back again and I'm taking the shade
xenon and I am just packing that on my
entire lid and then I decided that the
look needed a little bit more yellow so
I took me on one more time and buff that
higher up into the crease so I didn't
think the lid shade was like neon enough
or vibrant enough so I took electric
warrior by Kat Von D and I wet the brush
using a setting spray and I just setting
the spray I said that weird using a
setting spray and just pack that on the
lid and then I went on top of it once
more with Zenon I kind of made like a
neon green sandwich there to highlight
underneath my brow bone I took makeup
geeks white lies it's just a matte white
and from my inner corner highlight I
took makeup geeks karma I'm going to
move on to the rest of my face before I
finish up the eyes I'm priming my face
with the redness reducing step one scan
equalizer by Make Up For Ever and the
foundation I'm using is the Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation I'm in
the shade light sand and a lot of you
guys have been asking me what I think
about this foundation I really like it
it's light weight and it's pretty dewy
but it's not greasy or anything I think
a lot of people might like this I like
the coverage as well so I'm just buffing
that into my face and then I'm going to
take my Maybelline better skin concealer
and I'm going to apply this underneath
the eyes to not only cover up some of
that darkness but to highlight my face
as well
I'm also highlighting other parts of my
face as well I'm blending that in with
my little Kiko brush I don't know what
it's called or how I got it
but it's my little Kiko brush and I'm
just blending that in
just set underneath my eyes I bought
this recently because I've heard a lot
of people talk about this this is the
NYC skin smooth powder I think that's
what it's called but it's very messy
like very messy but it is a really nice
powder so I set my under eye concealer
with that and now I'm finishing up my
eyes I'm taking a nude eyeliner by NARS
and I'm just applying that to my
waterline taking that yellow eyeshadow
on my lower lash line and then I'm
taking xenon right on top of it blending
those two colors together with a pencil
brush and then I took karma one more
time and I'm just intensifying my inner
corners and I decided I wanted to take
it up on the lid a little bit and just
drag it on the lower lash line as well
and then to finish off my eyes I'm just
going in with some mascara and some
falsies these are the house of lashes
noir fairy falsies the new version it's
like the light version I just put on
some falsies and I'm bronzing up the
skin I'm using my Physicians Formula
butter bronzer this one is in the shade
bronzer a lot of people ask me which
color I have I have bronzer that's a
weird name to give a bronzer but it's
called bronzer moving on to blush I'm
taking this Pacifica mineral blush in
the shade camellia and I'm just applying
that onto my cheeks this is a brush I
bought at IMATS last year yes
Oh highlight I'm going to highlight my
face using the city color highlight and
I'm just applying this with a little
zoeva brush this is actually a really
pretty highlight and it was like $2 on
Amazon so you go City color and then I
decided I wanted to do three different
lip options this one is for the more
toned down gal this is Aquarius by
colour-pop it's just a nice nude lip but
if you want it to be a little bit
spicier this is the NARS satin lip
pencil in a name I can't really
pronounce but it'll be written down
below I think this is my favorite lip
option I love orange and green so this
is my favorite but if you are more of
like a purple gal this is for you this
is the ofra long lasting liquid lipstick
in the shade Cancun and that completes
this look thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and I will see you in my next
video bye I love it because it has kind
of like a shimmery cool tone bronzer and
then kind of like a shimmery warm
bronzer here on this side and when you
mix them together you get two beautiful
neutral bronzed glow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
