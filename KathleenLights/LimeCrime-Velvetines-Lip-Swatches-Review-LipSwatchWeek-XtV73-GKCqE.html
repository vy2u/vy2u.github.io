video i swatched um all of the Lime
Crime Velveteen I do own all of them
except one I don't own black velvet I
think that's what it's called it's just
poor he wants to leave and I just don't
see myself using that one so I didn't
buy it but I do own all of them and I
purchased all of them myself so I really
love these I had such a hard time doing
this lip swatch video today because
these are like intense these are like
true liquidy they're not like the
Anastasia Beverly Hills ones and
Nastasia Beverly Hill ones that are kind
of creamy now he wants to come back in
he meets the makeup is mind
those are creamier so they're like
easier to apply and remove these go on
very liquidy and dry super matte so
these are really really long wearing
like very long wearing they do tend to
start fading towards the inside first
like you get that lip liner effect after
a few hours but on me they last like
eight hours they're very long wearing I
love the scent of these I love them may
smell like buttercream like pure like
delicious cakey buttercream I love the
scent it doesn't linger on your lips but
I really like it I'm so disappointed in
this suede Berry is my favorite one out
of I just want to tell you guys this
story for some reason but suede berry is
my favorite one out of all of them and
it was the first one I ever had I had it
awhile ago I did a tutorial using it and
I bought a new one because that one was
old and this one is super liquidy I
definitely got like a bad one I hadn't
used it yet since I bought it and I
bought it like two months ago and I lost
my order number and my tracking and I
deleted everything so I'm gonna have to
buy another one cuz I definitely got a
faulty one does that happen to you guys
this one is super runny and liquidy and
not the same consistency and it just
doesn't look the same I'm so upset but
anyway besides that I really really like
these these are a little bit drying
though they are very very matte I
recommend using something like an EOS
lip-balm underneath or a chapstick
underneath then if you hate that drawing
feeling I don't mind them but they are
super drying because they are super long
wearing and super matte I think that
lime crimes customer service sucks asked
honestly I was trying to order these on
their website for like five hours once
when they restocked and they just
weren't answering emails and I don't I'm
not a fan of the freaking customer
service but these are actually really
good I hope you enjoyed today's lip
swatch and I know a lot of people are
like okay I'm over lip swatch week and a
lot of people are excited for it I can't
please everyone but it was requested for
me to do this so just keep trucking just
got a couple more days left I will link
the lip swatch week playlist below not
playlist but I'll link the videos and
then you can also see what's coming up
tomorrow and the next day and stuff
thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
