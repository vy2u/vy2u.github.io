you
hey guys so obviously this video is
about the semi-new these are pretty new
the LA girl matte flat finish pigment
glosses in other words liquid lipsticks
now when I heard that la girl was coming
out with their versions of liquid
lipsticks I got really really excited
because you don't really see products
like this at the drugstore even though
you could really only get la girl online
you can get them at certain stores I
find la girl in nahuatl in Miami which I
don't I only think that Novato
is in Miami but I find la girl products
there some other people have found la
girl other places as well but I will
link the LA girl website down below this
video isn't sponsored just throwing that
out there
la girl did send me all of their matte
pigment glosses that's for me to try out
and so many of you requested this video
that's why I am filming it for you today
can you guys tell this side of my face
is like puffier the video you saw last
Monday's video was filmed like a week
and a half ago I haven't though that was
pre-recorded for a couple of those
videos were pre-recorded just because I
was hanging out with family all week
but my sister for Mother's Day and my
mom and my cousin just came from Cuba
not too long ago so I went to hang out
with him and be with my dad so I haven't
really been filming I just pre-recorded
a lot but the past week I'm sorry I will
get to the review now in a minute but
the past week I have had such incredible
pain in this wisdom tooth right here and
I went to the dentist yesterday found
out it was infected I need to remove all
my wisdom teeth but this one is infected
so it's like puffy and swollen and it
hurts and yeah I'm on antibiotics and
all that stuff but I won't be able to
remove them for like a month it's a big
issue but if you've noticed that my
cheek is like puffier people have been
telling me it looks puffy here it's
because I have an infected wisdom tooth
so there are pros and cons with this
and I will get into that so the pros I
want to talk about the pros really quick
because I do think that these are
actually pretty amazing these only
retail for $5 that's incredibly
inexpensive considering so many liquid
lipsticks out there on there $20 range
they have from nudes all the way down to
like a really dark purple I really like
the color selection I also am very
impressed with the applicator like the
wand is a very flat doe foot applicator
and I found that it was really really
easy to apply when when I was like
putting them on my lips you don't need a
lip liner with this is what I'm trying
to say these lasts a very long time on
the lips like very long very long in my
opinion they last longer than the
Anastacio liquid lipsticks they last
about as long as the dose of colors ones
if you're familiar with these dose of
colors liquid lipsticks they have like
the same longevity of like these now for
cons okay it smells kind of like paint
which isn't a con to me because I put it
on and then I don't smell it like at all
it smells a little bit like paint but
not an overpowering scent some of these
are not very good there are some that
are amazing that blew my socks off this
is one of the ones that I'm obsessed
with it's really good this one's in the
shade Fleur Fleur flare this one is
amazing I really love instinct I really
love the first one I applied frisky is
another favorite of mine I highly
recommend frisky there are some that
have amazing formula like you put it on
and it's not patchy at all but then
there are others that are kind of patchy
a little bit I was kind of like doing
this and this in the lip swatches so you
can kind of see which ones I loved and
which ones were okay the pastel neon
ones are a little bit patchy I'm not
going to lie like you have to go layer
after layer and then it's like the more
layers you put on the patch here look so
it's kind of weird and also the super
dark ones are patchy I definitely had a
harder time applying the last two dark
ones because they just didn't go on
evenly on
my lips at all but all the other ones
worked really well I found that they
were really really pigmented they went
on really smooth and all in one swipe
like the rest of them went on really
well
another thing that isn't great is that
they kind of stay a little bit tacky on
the lips like when you do this you they
kind of stay just a little bit tacky
throughout the day but I honestly don't
find myself doing this throughout the
day so it really doesn't bother me as
long as I don't like put my lips
together I'm perfectly fine honestly it
will give these a B+ just because of the
little bit of the tackiness and because
some of them only a few of them the
formula kind of isn't that great and it
gets patchy but besides that I give
these a thumbs up I give it a B+ and I
think you should definitely check these
out considering that they're only five
dollars I think it's well worth your
money or at least well worth giving a
shot so yeah that completes this video I
hope you guys liked this lip swatch
video I'm actually standing I'm usually
sitting but today I'm standing and I'm
gonna go take a nap because my tooth
hurts like a mofo and I'm about to take
some painkillers so thank you guys so
much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
