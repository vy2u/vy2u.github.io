a review on the LA girl glazed lip
paints I actually have all six with me
right here to share with you guys this
is going to be a lip swatch video as
well so if you want to see all of these
lip paints on my lips and stay tuned
because i swatched them all on my lips
for you so basically what these things
are are liquid lipsticks in my opinion
it says super intense color extra glossy
finish they're a mixture of like a
really really pigmented lipstick mixed
with a super shiny lip gloss you can get
these at la girl usa.com or you can get
them at drugstore Calm they retail for 4
dollars on the LA girl USA website but I
saw them today at drugstore comm for
like 349 all in all these are 4 bucks
and they are super super inexpensive and
so good that's why I'm really excited to
share them with you guys I'm sure you
guys have seen this a bunch of times I
feel like they're getting a lot of hype
recently but for a really good reason
they are so so cheap and so so good but
they come in a little squeezy tube like
this the packaging is similar to the Too
Faced melted lipsticks but I don't think
that they are similar I know a lot of
people say that they are but I
personally don't think so the melted
lipsticks are like kind of matte and
creamy and these are like slippery and
shiny not slippery in a bad way but just
very very glossy and the two-faced ones
are not it kind of reminds me a lot of
the OCC lip tars like the really glossy
ones - that really weird scent I don't
know if I'm like the only one who feels
like I was putting on an OCC lip tar so
for the other day I was like the smells
strange I still love the OCC lip tars
they just smell a little weird on the LA
girl website it says extreme bright
colors cool and nourish lips with
vitamin E and peppermint oil and I
couldn't agree more they definitely are
not drying they feel pretty nourishing
on the lips and they smell exactly
like Christmas candy they smell like
peppermint big-time and if you really
know me you know that I hate anything
mint flavored or anything that has
anything to do with mint but I actually
do not hate the scent of this I was
really afraid that these were gonna
smell like very drugged story like kind
of plasticky and chippy smelling but I
like that they smell like candy canes
instead I prefer a minty scent over like
a super teepee smelling kind of product
but I don't find that the peppermint is
really overpowering I don't smell it
throughout the whole day or anything
like that another great thing about this
product is that this brand is cruelty
free so that's always good in terms of
the way that they feel they are not
sticky I was so excited when I first
applied this on my lips and I was like
oh my god this isn't sticky because it
is so pigmented and so glossy on the
lips you would think that this is going
to be like a hot sticky mess and it is
not like at all
they feel just really really slick like
I could rub my lips together back and
forth and not feel sticky or anything
like that I love the way that these feel
on the lips and since I hate anything
sticky I'm glad this is what the
packaging looks like and when you open
it it is a squeezy tube so you just
squeeze it out onto your lips it has
just a little flat side where the
product comes out so it is pretty easy
to get some products out you don't have
to sit there and squeeze really hard the
packaging is it's pretty good another
good thing is that I feel like these
last on my lips for a pretty long time I
get a few hours of wear with it before I
have to reapply they just last a good
amount of time on my lips personally
overall I think that these things are
amazing especially for the price they
are $4 which is insane to me that is
super cheap there are a couple of things
that I don't like about this product
that I will get into right now actually
one of them is that they feather on my
lips I will apply this on my lips and
about an hour later I see it feathering
down my face it could be because it's so
pigmented and creamy and amazing so it
does feather so what I do is I use my
Milani anti
a lipliner and when I use this I don't
have a feathering problem right now I
didn't I actually didn't use it today
and I've had this on for like about an
hour already and I could tell that it's
starting to feather but um when I use
this the feathering doesn't happen so I
mean that's a problem but if you have an
anti feathering lipliner then it's not
an issue I just outlined my lips with
this and then apply this on top and I'm
good to go
another thing I don't like about this is
that it's not the easiest lip product to
apply because of the applicator because
it's just like a round flat surface and
you do have to squeeze this out it will
get everywhere and because it is so
pigmented and like glossy it could
become a hot mess if you're not careful
so I find the best way to apply this is
with my Real Techniques detailer brush
which is a lip brush this is the best
lip brush I've ever come across because
it just come to a nice sharp point so
what I do is I just squeeze some out of
the tube put some on my lip brush and
then apply it that way and then it's
smooth sailing like it applies perfectly
fine so I mean it's not hard to apply if
you have a lip brush but if you're just
expecting to just like put it on your
lips and then go out the door it might
be a little bit hard because you won't
have that perfect application near the
outside of your lips unless you're like
really good at that I suck at applying
products like this on my lip because I'm
not very neat so I'm the type of person
that definitely needs a lip brush but I
mean that is no big deal and also the
last thing I don't like about this is
that it gets all over your teeth if
you're not careful again since it's so
glossy it gets on my teeth really easily
so I like apply this and then smile and
I'll have like some stuff on my teeth so
I just do like the little lipstick trick
or like yeah the trick where you put
your thumb in your mouth and pull out
and you have like all the excess
lipstick on your thumb those are minor
little issues to me personally
especially since everything else about
it is pretty good if you are looking for
something that's affordable high shine
glossy intense pigmented color then I
would definitely consider the LA girls
glaze lip paints I think they are great
oh another great thing about these about
all of these
Julie is that you can build up the color
the lip swatches I'm going to be showing
you now in a second they I have two
layers on I applied it all fully to my
lips and then apply some more fully to
my lips again just to get the most
pigment out of these and I actually
really like that about these for example
this one right here called blushing this
could be a perfect everyday color it
doesn't have to be intense as it comes
out of the tube all you have to do is
apply some to your finger and then dab
it all over your lips lightly and you
get to nice light color I should have
shown you guys that but I didn't I
showed you just like as pigmented as
they get but all of these can be sheared
out and worn like an everyday look you
just stab them on your lips and it's
really really pretty because it still
has a light color but it's still really
glossy so I see myself using these all
the time because you basically get two
colors out of each you get like a really
really light mauve or like an intense
bold mauve you know I mean midnight
purple or an intense purple so yeah I'm
just going to run down any colors that I
have I do have all six colors this one
is called blushing it is that perfect
mauve color this one is one of my
favorites it's probably like my top two
and it is called baby doll it's exactly
that like a baby doll pink really really
pretty this one is called bombshell and
this is pretty much exactly at least in
my opinion like Mac's girl about town
like when I applied this I was like wow
this looks a lot like Max and girl about
town so that's a good thing to keep in
mind yeah this one which will be a lot
of people's favorites because like those
that brilliant ents purple lip looks so
good on so many people and it is called
coy and it's just a really intense
purple then this one is a really pretty
summery color it is called hot mess and
it is that hot vibrant Mandarin type of
color and then this is my other favorite
it is the one I'm wearing right now and
it is called pinup and it is that
beautiful glossy pinup glamorous red lip
so yeah I'm just going to go ahead and
get into the lip swatches
okay guys so I hope you enjoyed the lip
swatches and I hope they gave you a
better look of these really pigmented
lip paints I hope you check these out
because they are really good in my
opinion so that is everything I have to
say these are my thoughts my pros and
cons on this product thank you guys so
