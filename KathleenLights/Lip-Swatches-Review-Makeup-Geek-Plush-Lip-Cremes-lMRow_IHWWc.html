a lip swatch video and many reviews i
will tell you my reviews at the end of
the video but we are going to be lip
swatching the semi-new not like brand
brand-new but pretty new makeup geek
plush lip creams I recently did all of
the iconic lipsticks there was like 25
of them and eye lips watched all of them
I will link the iconic lipstick video
down below she released a bunch of new
lip products the iconic lipsticks the
plush lip creams that are in this
packaging and then she also came out
with plush lip mats that are in the same
packaging but they're shorter I was
going to combine both of those the
mattes and the creams in this video
because they're very similar just the
finish is different but there's a ton of
matte ones she released a bunch of plush
lip mattes and only nine plush lip
creams but I felt like if I combine both
of them in one video my lips would fall
off for sure for sure so I will do a lip
swatch video on those separately let me
know if you want to see a lip swatch
video on the plush matte lips but today
we are tackling these I will give you my
thoughts on my review at the end of this
video so if you want to see some lip
swatches on these bad boys well continue
watching and you'll see
you
you
okay so those were the lip swatches of
all nine of the new plush cream lips I
think these have a lot of pros to them
but I do think there are a few cons
first off I love the packaging I think
it is amazing I think she really did a
great job with the packaging it looks so
high-end to me the formula on these are
so strange and not strange they're just
very different her plush mattes are a
little bit more moosie they resemble the
NYX soft matte lip creams a lot these
are a little bit creamier they don't
look as matte on the lips as those do
which is what I really like about them I
think that I like the plush creams more
than I like the plush maps I'm not going
I'm not gonna say that yet because I
have to do a lip swatch video on those
and after trying all of them I'll let
you know but I like that this has like a
creaminess to them makeup geek describes
these as a mix between a mousse and a
cream which I totally agree with they do
give you that plush feel to the lips I
can't even describe it you would have to
try it for yourself
it doesn't feel like a lipstick but it
doesn't feel like a liquid lipstick it
doesn't feel like a gloss it's like a
weird hybrid lip that feels plushy on
the lips there are paraben free and they
also are talk free I really like these
but I don't think they're like
mind-blowing I think I like her iconic
lipsticks a little bit more but I'll
still use these and wear these okay a
couple things I don't like some of them
are a little bit patchy you notice like
on the back of my hand when I was
watching them they were a little bit
hard to swatch and that's only because
my hand has these like bumps on them so
it's always hard to swatch lip products
when I'm holding it like this and I was
watching it like this but these
specifically were a little bit harder to
swatch because the formula is so strange
the wand is really nice and I do think
you get enough product to fill your
entire lips but it'll be like a light
application of color I do think you need
to dip back in and apply another layer
to get the full opaque color because
with one layer it'll look sheer in
certain parts of your mouth
I also wish just like the iconic
lipsticks that she would release more
nudes I haven't really opened the matte
ones maybe there are more nudes with
those but I really wish you had more
nudes in this formula the only nude
really is this one in jet setter and
it's a very Brown nude but that's just
like my little two cents in I wish there
were more nudes but I feel that way
about so many things
I just I love nude lips some of these
colors I really really love though like
free spirit is so beautiful it's like a
red but it has like a corally orange
look stunning I love
I do like the formula though I don't
think lasts as long as a liquid lipstick
but I mean only liquid lipsticks lasts
as long as liquid lipsticks most lip
products will fade throughout the day
you will have to reapply them and that's
how I feel about these and then the last
con for me is I feel like they're the
kind of formula that you need a lip
liner underneath I'm always super
cautious with my lips I'm always so
scared that things are gonna smear which
is why I reach for matte lips so often
especially for dark colors for nudes
I don't really care if they smear it's a
quick fix but for darker colors when
they feel slippy and slightly I just
know I have to put a lip liner
underneath just so I know it's not gonna
budge or go anywhere I've only used one
color throughout the whole day which is
jetsedder so kind of basing my review on
this specific shade and how it lasted
these retail for $14 each and you get
point 10 ounces in each product I like
them I think they resemble the NARS
velvet lip glides a lot as I was
applying them they have a very similar
feel and they're much more affordable
than those they're very very comfortable
on the lips
alright I do think these are pretty good
let me know what you guys think about
them have you picked any of them up I
would love to know your thoughts if you
like the creams or the mattes which ones
do you like more but yeah that completes
this video this was my mini little
review I hope you guys enjoyed thank you
so much for watching please subscribe if
you haven't already and I will see you
in my next video bye and then she also
released plush release oh it's not for
me never fails bro
I'll don't let me bother you let me stop
you continue continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
