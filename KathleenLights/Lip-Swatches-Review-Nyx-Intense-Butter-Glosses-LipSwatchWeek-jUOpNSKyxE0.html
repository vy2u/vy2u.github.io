I can just like
just like just really
hey guys and welcome to day one of lip
swatch week if you guys have been
keeping up with my recent videos you
know that I had been planning to do lip
swatch week and basically every single
day this week except Sunday I will be
doing lip swatches on certain different
lip products so today is Monday and the
lip swatches were on the NYX intense
butter glosses this whole week I will
start off with the lip swatches because
I know people really want to see that
first so I will start off with the lip
swatches and then I will tune in here at
the end and I will tell you guys really
quickly a tiny little mini review on the
product some of these products are new
on the market and some of them are not
for example these are brand new tunics
these are being launched for their 2015
spring collection that's why so many of
these colors are actually really fun and
bright not very neutral at all I will
say I love these really quickly just
talk about it they are very thick like
when you put them on they're kind of
amoliant
and they feel thick but it's not a
sticky thick you don't go like this and
see the stickiness happening they just
are so pigmented that they do have to be
just a little thick you do feel them on
the lips you put these on and you know
that they're there you know that they're
there but surprisingly I'm okay with
that because it's not sticky or goopy or
gross it's just like a thick emollient
texture so if you're not into feeling
something on your lips you won't be into
this they pretty much look exactly like
the original butter glosses only all of
their tops have this silver gunmetal
look you're super intense like the name
suggests and these would be perfect on
their own I really love the NYX butter
glosses the original on their own but
they're also great lipstick toppers
these are so pigmented that you do not
need a lipstick under I will highly
highly recommend a lip liner because
they're so pigmented and so intense you
can get some feathering and you can get
some bleeding with these and you can get
some sleepy slighty action with this
they might get on your teeth a little
bit but I definitely
and using a lip liner and that problem
goes away I will say my two favorite
ones are orange sickle because this is
like a super intense neon orange and
then I really liked it I switch it
because this is not the resolution and I
also really like that I switch it
because it's their most neutral one it's
perfect for every day they are very very
glossy like the shine on these are
intense another great thing is that they
last forever the NYX butter gloss is the
original these guys are something that I
do have to touch up throughout the day
but these intense ones they are really
long wearing they almost cause a stain
after a while you do want to reapply
maybe in a couple of hours to put that
shine back on your mouth but it stains
like it's on your lips I will point out
that I decided to do arm swatches as
well because everybody tells me that lip
colors look so dark on my lips I have
very pigmented lips like they're kind of
red and lip colors just always look a
tad darker on me so I hope you enjoyed
this video and I hope you guys are
excited for lip swatch week I am if you
do like this mini series on my channel I
will do it again maybe in like a month
and a half or two months if you guys
really like it if you want to see the
other products I will be lip swatching
this week I will leave a list down below
like what's coming up tomorrow Wednesday
and all that stuff so I will list it
down below I am doing drugstore and
high-end so today was drugstore
tomorrow's high-end the following day
will be drugstore and so on and so forth
