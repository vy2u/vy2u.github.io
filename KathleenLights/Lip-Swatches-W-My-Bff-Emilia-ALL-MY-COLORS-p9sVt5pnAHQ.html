with Amelia this is my best friend I've
spoken about her a few times and cat
chats story times she was the person who
got drunk in Vegas if you guys remember
my story time video I'm sure they did so
this video was highly requested it's
kind of similar to the video I filmed
and I posted on Wednesday so I'm sorry
if this seems a little bit repetitive
I've messed up a hundred times before I
get things right but okay cool but on
Wednesday I posted a video all about my
new collection with colour-pop and i
swatched everything on my lips the three
new colors and I asked you guys in that
video if you wanted to see another lip
swatch video with Amelia where we
applied the same thing my three new lip
colors and a ton of you guys said yes
because you wanted to see it on Amelia
since she has a more like tan skin tone
and you wanted to see how it looked on
her skin tone versus my skin tone and I
thought that was a great idea so we're
actually lip swatching all of my collabs
not only I was showing you the three new
satin lips but I am also going over all
the other collabs I've done Lumiere
Taurus Lumiere too and I'm also showing
you I'm also showing you guys Miami
fever and Havana nights by Ofra which is
another collaboration of mine basically
all of my lip collabs we are gonna be
swatching them for you guys because it
was so requested so that's what we're
doing we're just gonna be discussing the
colors so the first one we're gonna do
is Aquarius this is probably the
lightest color I've ever come out with I
wanted to do something that was my
perfect nude you don't want this one to
you you know I haven't tried this one on
actually wow you're horrible frame
it looks so different on me so and then
we're going to go over it with the
aquarias a little stick
this is a cream formula that's why it
looks like glossy come easy I like it
yeah I think it looks good on you
there's another bud no I think it looks
good on you it looks like a nice like
nude like super nude but news
hey hey there's almost a little bitter
are you my friend are you okay so now
we're gonna go in with the Lumiere
lipliner yeah yeah
Lumiere looks really purple on me you
know looks really like not unlike a lead
me on
but what like it kind of like reminds me
of Aquarius a little bit but it's more
pinky yeah
well it's close on you it does kind of
resemble Aquarius but it looks fine on
you okay well it's really the middle see
the second one looks like that
I think on me let me go to Nicole now
we're gonna go over it with Lumiere
lippy stick see this is to me the stick
is much more purple than the lip liner
oh yeah yeah like it looks darker yeah
putting the lip line putting the
lipstick on top yeah makes it more
purple
welcome welcome to the ring anybody
listen just got here now we're going to
apply down
I don't know why my hand is shaking go
big time alright my hand is shaking well
I didn't get your hand I just saw that's
my line is because my hand is shaking
you think oh my god well that is a
Miranda sings lip swatch I've ever seen
one different on immediateiy go perfect
height oh thank you I can't argue yeah
like this one like wow that looks so
pretty in skin tone you know why don't
you wear that one more often I have no
idea I have to put them out yeah I think
these imma put them out because I
literally like I don't do makeup every
day right mrs. Torres it looks so
different but I like I really like how
it looks both ways always work and yeah
now we're gonna do the Libby stick on
top
this one the lippy stick is pretty much
the same color as a lip liner oh yeah it
just gives it yeah
now we are going to do the Elissa ultra
satin lip that just launched July 12 I
will have the colour-pop website down
below
I'm doing tossing her since I have such
small lips oh this one is very light on
you I will probably use a lip liner to
darken it a little bit but yeah
next up is November also an ultra satin
lip from the new launch this is my
favorite one I mean this is my favorite
one I love it
I really like this one oh thanks it
looks like neon on you almost looks like
Coralie like a little indigo there's a
Coralie like bright I just take a cord
yeah Cory yeah really pretty like
summary on me it's just like more rosy I
think
next up is point zero
Disko the next cumple labeling it right
before real and you yeah it looks like
stone from mac like uh no looks like and
those look like stone on you yeah that
looks really cool with like a really
intense eye makeup for you I think it
looks good
I'm hurry yeah I really like this one
it's like my second one after November
everything okay so the next one is the
last color pop one we're going to swatch
because the other two are from Oprah
this is Lumiere to this is an ultra
matte lip it's different from the
statins it's way more matte and it's
harder to take off it lasts longer but
it's not as comfortable as the ultra
silent
this was so requested to come out with
like a Lumiere version in the ultra
matte formula
look all purple it looks on a cat and a
colleague dusty rooms in economy yeah I
love this limo
I do love that too I like you me or two
okay like for tennis cane I prefer
Lumiere 2 or Lumiere like I'm tan skin
yo means ooh yeah that one looks so nice
against your skin tone now we're going
to do the Miami fever liquid lipstick
white Oprah cosmetics this one is the
orange Ebert run one
on me this looks more like a red orange
on you it looks like an orange lemon
orange and I love ya I love I love how
this looks online I think I did this one
with like a very forest green smokey eye
and a super um super yacht yeah yeah I
like those come together let me do it
so finally we are talking on the last
lip color and this is Havana nights by
Oprah as well like other since monster
these liquid lipsticks not ready good
this is the old packaging by the way
they have like new updated amazing
packaging but we just have like the
order
I think this home makes my teeth look
extra white yeah yeah this one does make
my teeth look whiter I think it looks
pretty similar on us
actually this is like the first one that
looks similar on me it's just obviously
a little bit deeper like like more vampy
but yeah it's like it really it's a nice
dark red yeah okay so that completes
this video these were all my lip collabs
swatched on our lips on me I'm a little
bit more fair and Amelia's a little bit
more of a deeper skin tone than I do I
hope you guys found this video helpful I
know it was so requested to see it on
someone with a different skin color than
me so I hope you liked it and this was
Amelia if you guys want me to do a best
