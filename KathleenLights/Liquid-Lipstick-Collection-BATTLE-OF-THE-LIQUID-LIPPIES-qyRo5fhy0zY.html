I would film a very very highly
requested kind of video and it is the
Battle of the liquid lipsticks a lot of
you guys have asked me to do a video on
all of the liquid lipsticks I own and
talk about the good ones the great ones
the ones that are okay just give an
overall review on all the ones I own now
liquid lipsticks I feel like so
everybody is getting tired of them
everybody has heard about them every
company is coming out with them and they
are but I think for a very good reason
every company when they see something is
really big they'll come out with similar
things so while all of these are liquid
lipsticks they're not all created equal
some of them are better than others so
I'm not gonna lip swatch these things
because I mean you guys know I'm very
good with lip swatches I will lip swatch
anything I don't care but I have like a
million here but if I did do a lip
swatch video on any of these products I
will link them down below also I will be
sharing with you my top 3 favorite
liquid lipstick formulas out of these
brands that I own there are three that
are the best of the best and I highly
recommend them no matter what I love
them anyway so I keep all of my liquid
lipsticks in this guy right here this is
a Muji drawer that I purchased on Amazon
I just searched Muji drawer and then I
chose the one that's the five drawers
they have a different one they have a
bunch of different Muji drawers I picked
this one because I needed somewhere to
store all my liquid lipsticks since uh
clearly I have way too many and I didn't
want to buy it because it was a pretty
penny but I was like you know what it's
a good investment
it looks nice to display in your room
and they're really good quality so I'm
not gonna go in any order I'm just gonna
stay here and review all of them for you
and then I will swatch on my hand my
favorite ones from each brand I'm gonna
start with the first drawer because it's
the first drawer I have the Anastacio
liquid lipsticks and I don't have all of
them I just recently started receiving
products from Anastacio I never used to
before but just recently they started
sending me like their new products and I
had purchased five of these on my own
and they weren't my favorite I did
really love persimmon where is it this
one I love this one I didn't get any
spearing with this the only ones that I
didn't love were pure Hollywood and
vintage they are no longer here because
I don't like those but I do find that
their new releases they came out with
new ones trust issues Veronica sepia I
found that those had a better formula I
don't know if I'm crazy am i crazy but I
feel like her new releases for fall had
a better formula anyway so these are
around the twenty dollar price point
which is very common for liquid
lipsticks unless they're drugstore or an
affordable brand and people really love
these these are not my absolute favorite
but they are not bad they are not the
worst liquid lipsticks I've ever used
they have a moosie consistency it's a
like a very whipped consistency and when
they dry down they do have a little bit
of tackiness like you could press your
lips together and feel it a little bit
but that has never bothered me and a
little in a liquid lipstick so what I
really do love about the Anastasio
liquid lipsticks is the packaging
they're very fancy very pretty and they
have a nice color selection this is not
all of them but these are the ones that
I like the ones that I didn't like I did
give away to my friends I'm quickly
going to show you my favorite ones that
I highly recommend this is sepia it's a
very beautiful um gray toned color a
little bit of brown in it very nice for
fall time
this is persimmon I love this I love
orange II reds such a beautiful
beautiful color in the summer time
especially because it's like Hot Tamale
I love Veronica my mother-in-law is
really gonna like that cuz her name is
Veronica she watches my videos hey
Veronica this is Veronica I love this
one so much it's a really pretty mob
with it's a deeper mob though it's not
like your regular mob it has a little
bit of like dust to it and like a
chocolaty vibe to this mob I love this
one trust issues is amazing it's also
one of their new ones and I highly
recommend this one I didn't get any
bleeding or anything that's trustus you
trust issues it's like Veronica but much
more purple
deeper and then I also really like
bloodline and it's just their basic red
shade but it's your really pretty red
makes my teeth look yellow I mean white
images look white so yes those are my
favorite um I find that these don't
crumble on my lips these specifically
and they don't fade ugly I really like
these but vintage and pure Hollywood it
did not wear nicely man enough to say
that I miss you I feel so untouched in I
want this is gonna be a mess sidenote
whoa
I know if you do want your lip swatch
video with any of these that I haven't
done a lip swatch video on yet let me
know okay um let's go into this drawer
right here it's full of random liquid
lipsticks I'm gonna share with you my
top three favorite liquid lipsticks at
the end of this video my top three
favorite brands those I'm gonna save the
best for last so I have three of the Kat
Von D liquid lipsticks I feel like these
were around really early on the first
brand that I saw really come out with
them I believe these are around 20
dollars I could be lying and the three
colors I have are a go go Requiem and
Lolita my favorite one is this one and
it is a go go now these aren't my
favorite they're a little bit drying on
the lips which I you guys know I don't
mind I could wear some mint on my lips
and I'm perfectly fine but I have a
slight issue with these this one is my
favorite one it's a go-go it's a bright
orange there's like no red to this it's
orange and I love matte orange lips
they're my favorite but for some reason
this one I could only apply one layer to
it if I try to apply two layers it gets
patchy and if I press my lips together
and I separate them it comes off like a
patch will be missing from my bottom lip
and it'll be on my top lip if that makes
any sense so I don't love that about
this I have to be very very careful but
I do love the color and I love that it
lasts through a hurricane
so for though for the
reason I do recommend these anyway this
one is recommend it's a beautiful color
it's one of her new releases the other
two are older already um it's a dusty
lilac this is what it looks like right
here I like it because it's like a dusty
version of a purple it doesn't make my
teeth look yellow and it's not too
intense and then this one is Lolita and
I'll show you this let me show you this
does that look like Lolita to you or
does that look like poop I'm pretty sure
I got the bad batch of Lolita which kind
of upsets me that there are even any bad
batches like come on Kabbani come on so
I think I got a bad batch even though I
still love this color but I don't think
this is the real Lolita color so all in
all I do really recommend these I have
one from the brand hot makeup it's a
purple it's called moonlight glow and I
bought it at I met and I still haven't
used it yet I have two of the Sephora
collection cream lip stains these are
amazing amazing amazing definitely top
five to me they're not sticky they're
not patchy they go on really smooth I
really love the applicator
they smell like cupcake frosting they
have a really nice scent to them and
they go on very pigmented and very
smooth I really have no complaints about
these at all I just wish they came out
with a bunch of different like colors a
little bit more nudes i didn't really
see many nudes at all this one is in the
shade ten and it is a hot Coralie red
right there and then this one is in the
shade 0-2 and it is a peach color right
there very very beautiful formula these
are liquidy but they don't dry out my
lips they're not very mu C which I like
and they just don't dry my lips I really
like it a lot so I highly highly
recommend these and they're cheaper than
the average liquid lipstick I think
these are around $12 I'm making that up
at this point I'm also from the Sephora
collection these are their luster matte
long-wear lip colors I do think these
lasts longer than these these fade a
little bit faster than the
but I still love them I just love these
a little bit more I still I don't know
uh it's a tie
no I love these more I just don't like
the color selection of these at all I
think the other ones have a better color
selection this one is in the shade pink
luster nude pink luster I'm sorry
and it's just a pink and everyday
wearable pink I love the applicator on
these more than the other one because it
is a flat doe foot applicator it's like
a paddle style and I love those because
I feel like it's easier to apply and
then this one is in the shade russet
luster it's my favorite it's a red but
it's a rusty red it's right there I
highly recommend these they're so
pigmented don't dry out my lips and they
last a very very very long time and
they're also cheaper than your average
liquid lipstick these are the la splash
liquid lipsticks now they have two
different formulas but I don't see a
difference in both of the formulas they
have the lip Couture's and then they
have the smitten lip tints to me they
are the exact same formula I really
really really love these I get a smooth
application I highly recommend them
they're $11 I believe um so very good
price for liquid lipsticks but I don't
like the scent I wish they would have
had like a pleasant vanilla scent they
have a very like almost like chemical
like scent I don't know I'm not a fan of
that scent so for that it gets like one
star down but I do love the color
selection especially these two right
here this one is in ghoulish they have
another one called
OG ghoulish but I like this one more I
love the applicator on these because it
is a flat paddle style this is in the
shade ghoulish as you can see it has
like a purpley Mavi gray undertone love
it and this one is charmed it's their
nude and I actually really liked it
right there it's their nude with a
little bit of a mob it's like a dusty
nude that one is charmed and my favorite
one from this brand is called latte
confession
oh I love this color
so beautiful these are very liquidy
these might be drying to some people
maybe because they are that liquid
formula it's not a mousse it's a liquid
like an actual liquid lipstick I have
all of the LA girl matte flat finish
pigment glosses these are liquid
lipsticks and these are amazing I have a
lip swatch video on them I love them I
don't like the darker colors I got rid
of them because they were super patchy
very uneven not good at all but these I
love these I will recommend two that I'm
obsessed I mean three that I am obsessed
with if you are into the color you need
to go by these three because they are
amazing
this one is in the shade dreamy it's
like their regular everyday nude pink I
love it these by the way the applicator
they don't have a great smell they smell
kind of I don't like the scent but I
don't care they're so inexpensive I
believe these are around $4 that's
probably the cheapest a liquid lipstick
has gotten except the wet and wild ones
I haven't tried those but these are so
inexpensive they're so smooth all of
these except the dark ones but they're
so smooth they're not patchy they're
very comfortable there an actual liquid
lipstick though not moosie at all you
apply it to your lips you can do a few
layers and it does it does dry down
completely 100% matte there is a slight
tackiness to it but nothing that bothers
me and they last a very long time on the
lip so this one is dreamy highly
recommend my favorite favorite favorite
favorite one is this one in the shade
Fleur Fleur blue this is the one I wear
the most out of all of them I feel like
for some reason that this color is very
unique it's a nude but it's like a
brownish peach nude I love how this one
looks it's so pretty and then instinct
is my other favorite it's a beautiful
red orange that is instinct right there
I love these three I highly recommend
these three they are so good I'm going
to link every website down below of the
Bran's I'm talking about okay so now I'm
just gonna go into this shirt husband
this drawer right here also full of
random ones so these are the meet Matt
Hughes by the brand called the bomb
I love the bomb they do it right all the
time I gave away a couple of ones that I
didn't see myself wearing but these five
are my favorite yeah the color selection
with the meet Matt Hughes isn't very big
I think they have like ten colors only
and a lot of them are like red cherry
strawberry kind of colors but
nonetheless they are beautiful colors I
love these they're very very very
comfortable to wear
they smell like mint chocolate chip
literally oh my god it's a crazy like
identical it's crazy I really like them
they do last a long time and I'm going
to share with you my two favorites that
I highly recommend this one is called
committed these are very comfortable on
the lips they're not drying whatsoever
because they do have more of a moosie
texture this one is committed and this
one is charming you just have to build
up the color a little bit it's not that
pigmented with just one swipe but
obviously very pigmented but these are
super super comfortable one of the more
comfortable liquid lipsticks that I own
in my collection let's talk about the
Stila all day liquid lipsticks these
were my favorite liquid lipsticks when I
first got into them these were my
all-time favorite and now they didn't
even make it to my top three because I
think the other three brands are better
but I really love these nonetheless a
lot they do have that moosie formula but
they stay forever on my lips it's crazy
I actually did include one of the Stila
liquid lipsticks in a parade is a
pointing products video the shade this
Auto I don't like it crumbles really bad
but these I love some people find these
drying but I personally don't and I
really love their color selection it's
not super big but I really like it I was
going to share with you my favorite ones
but all of these are my favorite ones
this one is in the shade Aria it's the
best fall color ever
forever this is what it looks like I
love this color it's stunning stunning
Aria definitely one of my favorites the
ever-so-popular patina probably my
favorite one out of all of them oh my
gosh patina is so good I wore it at Fame
Expo and it lasted all day no crumbles
and nothing I love them they're so
pigmented one swipe and you're done you
don't need to apply more than one layer
I really love this one in the shade
Bella it's amazing on the lips it's like
the most vibrant hot delicious pink ever
oh by the way please smell like cupcakes
I love the scent then this one is Dolce
this one has shimmer to it which I
actually really like because it's a
beautiful brown with like gold shimmer
and I know that may throw you off but it
gives such a beautiful summery look to
your lips I really like it and in the
fall too so pretty and then this is my
favorite red lipstick of all time from
any liquid lipstick and it is a fiery
and that is what it looks like because
it's a deep deeper red it's not like a
ruby rule kind of red so I love these
five and I highly recommend them welcome
to John Adam ty where you are gonna die
that's right okay so let's meet the new
drugstore loves of my life these
unfortunately were limited edition so
I'm not going to stress about them too
much I did give away the nude one
because I didn't like how the nude one
crusted up in my lip so I give that one
away but these are the Milani amore
matte lip creams I feel like Milani is
so crazy
for making these limited edition when
everybody loves liquid lipsticks and
their drugstore so they're better like
they're more accessible more affordable
why would they make these lip a decision
I don't know I have a lip swatch video
on these so I'm going to go to in depth
but these are a pure liquid lipstick
they dry so incredibly matte and they're
not tacky at all like you don't feel
like you can kiss ten people and it
won't transfer it's ridiculous I love
them so much but people might find them
drying but I really love them and they
were so affordable now opening this door
oh I had to
one of the ball meet Matt Hughes here
these are the colour-pop ultra matte lip
I didn't love all of them actually gave
away to my friends the ones that I
didn't like but these I love all of
these so I did keep the majority of them
and I think they are really good I'm a
kind of person like I said I can wear
cement on my lips I'm people have
complained to me that they're very
drying honestly when I wear them and I
put on a lip primer or a a lip liner
they don't dry on me they don't get
gross on me I love it especially I'm
going to recommend three I think are
amazing amazing
oh no I'm sorry for for this is in the
shade beeper I love beeper right here so
good so pigmented ah something to have a
set this is my favorite one of all time
this is in the shade of bumble this is
bumble right here I love that color
I love succulent it's the most vibrant
red ever ever ever right here I love
succulent and then this one is my
favorite one okay bumble is my favorite
one but this one is my second papercut
one this is in the shade sundae and I
don't know if you'll be able to tell but
this has a purple sheen through it it's
almost like a duochrome
I don't know any liquid lipstick that
looks like this so unique you can can
you tell like when you move your mouth
and you move you know you can see like a
sheen of purple in it amazing and for
some reason I don't know if I'm crazy I
don't know if it's the sheen in this
this one is the most comfortable to wear
out of all of them I love Sunday I
highly recommend Sunday if you're into
bright lips because this is so unique so
unique these dry very fast so you do
have to work with them a little bit and
there's six bucks the more I wear them
the more like them okay so those are all
the ones that I think are good actually
I think all my liquid lipsticks are good
clearly as you probably already saw but
now I'm going to talk about my top three
like I will if all of my liquid
lipsticks could disappear or had to
disappear
and I could only keep three brands I
would keep these three this is a no
particular order but you guys know how I
feel about the Oprah long lasting liquid
lipsticks one of the best liquid
lipsticks ever it does have a creamy
formula it's like a mousse and a cream
mixed together very creamy very very
very pigmented they have a bunch of
different colors I love their nudes
selection amazing and they last a very
very long time on my lips and they do
not dry out my lips I did a whole lip
swatch video on this so I'm not gonna
swatch any of them because I have a lip
swatch video on them but I highly
recommend the Oprah ones I have a coupon
code that you can use and get 40% off of
anything from Oprah but especially these
cuz they're the best and they're 20
Lauder but if you use my coupon code it
brings them down to 12 bucks so the
coupon code is Kathleen 40 I will have a
link to below
and my favorite liquid lipstick from
Oprah happens to be the one I'm wearing
this is my collab with Oprah now they
come in smaller packaging so that you
can use most more of the product in the
tube but it comes with the same amount
of product as the long skinny tubes but
anyway this is my collab with Oprah and
it is in the shade Miami fever I will
have it linked below you can use my
coupon code to get it so my other
favorite brand I'm really shocked that I
only have four of them because I want
them all but their color selection isn't
my favorite which sucks but word on the
street is that they're coming out with
new ones for fall so I'm gonna buy all
of them these are the dose of colors
what are these technically called I'm
just gonna go with liquid lipsticks
these are so good I even love the
packaging like they're so cute and
little
they're so good they're on $20 they're
pricey but I think they're worth every
single penny I will tell you what made
me realize while these are the best the
first let me show you the ones that I
have I actually only have one that is
permanent and it is the shade berry me
it's a really beautiful berry color
these are liquidy but they don't dry out
my lips at all this in the shade berry
me right there they have that liquid
consistency that they dry super matte
and you can barely feel them like at all
they last forever
they're not moosie
but there's home anyway and then I have
the Tara collection that they came out
with but I heard that they're gonna
actually make these permanent and you
can buy them individually so the Tara
collection comes with this one in brick
this one in sand and this one in stone
everybody's going crazy about stone it's
a beautiful color let me just watch it
might as long that is stone right there
this one's my favorite actually and it's
called sand and it is a super nude super
nude right there you could barely see it
I love it called sand and then this is
brick it's a really pretty deep red a
little bit of brown it's stunning right
there
stunning so let me give you a little
story really quick this video is 17
hours long I bought the Tara collection
specifically for brick and for stone I
didn't think I would like sand at all
because it is a very very nude lipstick
but when I bought it and I put it on I
was like wow I love it I loved it anyway
it looks amazing with the darkest of
dark smoky eyes I love the shade sand
and when I put it on I didn't have any
expectations for it I was like this is
going to give me that really disgusting
white crusty rim on the inside of my
mouth that every nude liquid lipstick
gives me every liquid lipstick that has
a very light nude like Anasazi or pure
Hollywood all of them give me that
disgusting crusty nice on the inside of
my mouth
none of the Oprah ones crossed up get
disgusting in my mouth they don't look
gross none of them even if I'm wearing
them for hours Sam looks fantastic I'm
obsessed with dose of colors liquid
Libby's and they are worth every penny I
love you and then the other the other
one that I love they're my top three are
the girl lactic lip paints these right
here she has eight of them in her line
and this is what they are I really love
the color selection I think she has like
pretty unique colors here and very
wearable colors like you can wear a lot
of these like on a daily basis I'm going
to share with you my three favorites
this one is in the shade divine it used
to be called de mirror but now it's
called divine this one
my favorite one I used to wear this one
so much last winter and fall that is
divine
this one is demure now I don't know if
you could tell the difference it's just
like a lighter version the vine has a
little bit like more rusty more like
dirt to it this one is allure I love
this one so beautiful and then I really
love starlit and blushing starlit is
such a beautiful everyday shade and so
is blushing you can wear both of these
on a daily basis who are anything on a
daily basis rules don't know rules this
one is blood no this one is Starla it's
a pink and this one is blushing it's a
lot more peach this is blushing so I
love these because they have an
incredible formula I love the scent the
scent is so pleasing it smells so
delicious I love the set and they are
liquidy they're so comfortable to wear
they just glide on my lips I love them
and I think they are seriously
underrated more people should talk about
the lip paints from girl lactic because
I don't hear about them enough so that
was my liquid lipstick collection I was
kind of like a battle of the liquid
lipsticks even though I said that they
were all good and just I love them all I
think some of them are better than
others but they all serve a beautiful
purpose in my collection so anyway that
completes this video I hope it wasn't
too long leave a comment down below of
your all-time favorite liquid lippy I
know some people hate them but if you
love them
leave me your favorite one thank you
guys so much for watching please
subscribe if haven't already and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
