we're running late whether it's to
school work or a birthday party I mean I
don't know maybe you're just sitting
there cuddling your dog for about thirty
minutes in the morning when you're
supposed to be getting ready or you're
just so silly pee that you can't even
function or your best friend calls you
on the phone and you're sitting there
talking for 20 minutes before you even
realize what time it is or if you're
like me you're sitting down at your desk
and you're scrolling through tumblr like
you do every single morning for god
knows how long I literally I live on
tumblr I really do so this video is for
those people who look at they're
watching me think crap I've got eight
minutes to get ready and I don't know
what to do anymore
well in this video I'm going to show you
five simple steps you can take to go
from zombie face to MySpace let's get
started step number one is concealer I'm
just going to go ahead and throw
foundation out the window here because a
lot of us don't really have time to put
on a full face of foundation in the
morning or just any day where you're
running late so just using a concealer
to go ahead and cover your dark circles
or cover any imperfections on your face
is the way to go even on days where I
have like really bad acne I've got
pimples all over my face this method
still works for me
because the concealer covers really well
of course that's why I love this
concealer in particular because of its
creamy consistency it's perfect for
underneath my eyes and for blemishes as
well
now moving on to step number two on that
is mascara layering on mascara is going
to make your eyes look a lot bigger
because they're just going to open them
up and it's going to take away that
little sleepy look you might have in the
morning and I love using a volumizing
mascara for something like this because
you really want something that's going
to show up and make a difference since
we're not using eyeliner or eyeshadow or
anything like that that's why I love
this mascara for something like this
because it's really packs a punch
putting mascara on your lower lash line
is optional by the way I just really
really like how it looks personally but
you can go ahead and skip this step if
you really want to now for step number
three and that is the most important
step your eyebrows your eyebrows are the
things that frame your face it's going
to pull any look together no matter if
you have a full face of makeup on or if
you have very minimal makeup like this
which is why filling in your eyebrows is
so important because sometimes when you
don't fill them in it can tend to make
you look a little bit washed out or like
you have no eyebrows and that's that's
not a good look for anybody I use powder
to fill them in but if you're looking
for something that's quicken on the go I
recommend the Anastasia brow is now
moving on step number four and that is
bronzer this step is just going to bring
you warmth back into our face because
sometimes in the morning you can look a
little tired or sleepy and for people
who just don't really like contouring or
doing anything specific just adding a
little bit of color to your skin will
just make you look put together which is
why I recommend a bronzer with a little
bit of shimmer in it because it does
give a healthy glow as opposed to a
matte bronzer so that's why I like those
and I'm holding on to step number five
which is my favorite step and it is a
bold lick and I've got four to show you
guys because I know different people
like different things the first bold lip
is of course my favorite is the red both
lip there is just something about very
red lipstick that just makes you look so
dressed up and done you can honestly
just have mascara like I have on right
now and I look like I actually tried
with my makeup which is why I love a red
lip for those of you who are not into
red lips and you want to be a little bit
more daring a deep purple lipstick is
perfect and it is also perfect for the
fall and it's something that's a little
bit different for those of you who are
bold and daring and just want to try
something different
I recommend it deep purple I think it's
pretty cool for those of you who prefer
a bright pink lip that works perfectly
with this look to just wear any bright
kind of fuchsia or pink I don't know
this one is my favorite it's from the
drugstore and it's just a beautiful hot
pink that looks good on everyone and it
works the same way rub that pink
lipstick girl
and I didn't forget those of you who do
not like to rock a bold lip at all this
is honestly my favorite lipstick to wear
what I want a bright lip but I don't
want it as bright because it's not super
muted but it's not super loud either so
it just works for those of you who are
not super into the bold lip but still
want some color to show up on your lips
okay guys so that is the end of this
video I really hope you enjoyed this
video I thought it would be a cool video
to make just because I know that some of
us run late in the morning so often or
some of us just don't like to wear a lot
of makeup but we still want to look put
together with minimal makeup you know I
get it this technically is kind of like
what I did on my no makeup makeup look a
while ago when I filmed that video but I
didn't add a bold lip or anything like
that the bold lip is actually what
inspired this video in the first place
because every time I wear like a bold
lip I honestly feel like I don't need
that much makeup on the rest of my face
because it just it just does so well on
its own I of course chose the red that
stick out of the four lipsticks I showed
you just because I think that real
lipstick is like the most beautiful
thing in the world it's my favorite so
yeah I hope you liked this video and I
hoped it helped you in some way thank
you so much for watching guys please
subscribe if you haven't already and I
will see you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
