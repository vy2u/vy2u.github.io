one at least it's exciting for me
because I really want to talk about this
and it is a review on look bookstore
comm if you don't know what look
bookstore comm is it is an online
shopping boutique basically they have
the cutest clothes ever and I love this
website I first heard of look bookstore
on Instagram they have like over a
million followers on Instagram and when
you go on their actual website which is
book bookstore calm I will have all the
links down below by the way the website
the clothes I'm going to be sharing with
you guys all that stuff so when you go
on their website and you look at it it
kind of looks like you're on Pinterest
with the way that the models are wearing
the clothes it's very like tough
it's very tumblr asian so cute like it
literally makes you want to buy
everything on the website because it's
so like Pinterest e I don't know so they
did send me a couple pieces from their
website they actually asked me to choose
a couple pieces that I was interested in
from the website so I'm gonna share them
with you today and know this isn't a
sponsored video and you don't give me
any money by clicking the links down
below just in case anybody was wondering
this is just my honest review of the
website which is great before I show you
the clothes I just want to tell you that
it is really really good quality you
know have you ever come across certain
websites that their prices are really
really cheap and their clothes look
really cute then you get them in the
mail the material and everything is just
you could tell like cheaply made yeah
you don't that doesn't happen with this
website and their prices are really good
for the clothes you get they're like
forever 21 prices the top will be like
25 dollars a maxi dress will be like $30
it's basically like an online forever 21
with a really cute boutique style
clothing do you know I mean it's it's
really cool and the best part is is that
it's free shipping worldwide so it
doesn't matter what part of the world
you live in you get free shipping which
is insane free shipping worldwide hello
yes please
anyway so I'm going to go ahead and show
you guys the pieces I picked out and the
first one I was really
I did to get even though we are going
into fall and this is like hot pink I
have always wanted a blazer this color
and this is what it looks like this
reminds me so much of Pinterest if you
guys are like Pinterest pinners like me
always on Pinterest you have seen this
before I know you have with like that
girl holding that clutch which is like
laughing in this blazer it's really
really similar at least and it is so
pretty the inside has like that really
nice material with a little lines going
through them and this feels like really
really really good quality another cute
thing it's kind of wrinkled because I
had it like thrown here on the floor cuz
I'm a mess but another really cute thing
about it is this little tiny button it
has like a really pretty like white
ankle button I don't know I love this
blazer so so so much it feels nice and
heavy really good quality and I was just
so happy when I got in the mail because
I have always always always wanted a hot
pink blazer and by the way I got all my
sizes in size 4 in the u.s. they have
different sizes depending on what
country you're in so it's another really
good thing you will be able to pick your
right size so I picked us 4 and this
next thing I also got in a u.s. 4 I got
everything the same size but this is a
little bit big on me I guess this runs a
little bit bigger keep that in mind if
you're interested in this shirt but it
is still really really gorgeous it's
that it's a really pretty white shirt
and then the sleeves are see-through
really nice a little cut here or the
little slip goes really really really
low so my boobs are like completely out
in this shirt so I had to wear a tank
top with it under and I didn't look like
my stripper or anything like that so I
didn't to wear with a tank top under
which doesn't look the prettiest but
maybe if I would have gotten in a
smaller size it would have been fine but
it still it's really pretty and it is so
elegant like when you put it on you feel
like oh my god I'm about to go curl my
hair and put on some red lipstick
because you feel really elegant when you
put this on really nice again really
good quality so but anything and then I
also got a bottom like a bottom piece
and I got these really cool like faux
leather leggings look at this look how
cool these are they have a slit right
here but it's see-through so you can see
your like legs in this part and it has
it here too it has that little
see-through thing there and then when
you turn it around it has one on one leg
in the back so it's really cool because
it's like different from just regular
faux leather leggings because it has
like the cool seat through a little mesh
part they're really really cool I'm
obsessed with these like the second I
put it on I was like oh these are so
cool I feel like really cool I don't
know and then my favorite favorite
favorite thing that I got in the mail is
this top I am obsessed with this top
love it I really love anything floral
especially this because if you can see
right here it's like frayed and it also
has it at the bottom it's like frayed at
the bottom so nice I love this color
because it just looks so romantic and
pretty and I love the flowers that
they're pink this shirt is a little bit
see-through so I did in the clip show
you guys with a tank top under because
my brother's come out a little bit it's
not like super see-through but my bra
does show a little bit so if you're not
comfortable with your bra showing a
little bit then definitely wear a tank
top under and it'll still look fine I'm
not wearing a tank top under right now
and it looks a little bit cuter without
the tank top but I know how you feel
girl like I don't want to walk around
with my raw showing so in the clip I was
wearing a tank top that was white so you
could really really see it but I'm
thinking if I get a tank top like this
tan color then you won't be able to tell
that much and it'll look really really
pretty but overall this is my favorite
thing that I got it's so comfortable so
pretty like fresh and beautiful also
more for like the spring and summer but
I don't care like I love this I love it
and for those of you guys loves to poke
holes and things and wear them like this
this is going to be your best friend I
have two more things to share with you
guys I picked out two things that
weren't clothes related
show you guys that they don't only sell
clothes they sell rings necklaces
sunglasses they sell shoes I think do
they sell shoes as well I'm not sure but
they sell a bunch of stuff not just
straight-up clothes so I wanted to show
you I got this belt I don't have a clip
of me wearing it because it doesn't
really go with any of the outfits but I
know you guys have seen these belts
before they're the really pretty belts
that go around your waist when you wear
like rompers or jumpsuits they look
really nice with those it just gives
every lik romper I swear like an elegant
look
I love these they're super popular right
now and yeah
so I picked this out really pretty and
then I picked up these really fun
glasses I don't know why but they looked
fun to me don't they look fun I know not
everyone likes these like bug glasses
but I think they're very like folk and I
feel they like them okay guys so that
was everything I really just wanted to
show you the little pieces I got and
wanted to tell you my thoughts on this
website I think it's great I was kind of
expecting less honestly like I didn't
expect it to be this cute in person or
to fit this nice in person because the
pictures since they look so Pinterest e
I thought that they were like fake
pictures and like oh that's not going to
look that good on me everything will be
linked down below if you're interested
in any of the things that I picked out
those will be linked down below as well
so thank you guys so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
