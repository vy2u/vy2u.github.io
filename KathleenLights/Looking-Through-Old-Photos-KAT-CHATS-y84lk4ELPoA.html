of this shelf because it didn't fit in
my shelves and I didn't realize that
when I went to go buy these shelves but
it is still in my cat jets corner just
all the way at the top do you see it so
Amy your canvas is still with us while
we're in our corner I have to put like a
nice curtain here in this corner because
it's like ugly I mean it's not ugly it's
fine but I do want like to cover these
little this anyway today's cat chats is
going to be photos I'm gonna show you
guys photos of me just pictures of me
growing up and family pictures and stuff
like that
and we could talk about some mistakes
fashion mistakes or any of that stuff
it's mainly pictures I wanted to find
more pictures of me in middle school
when my fashion was on point but I
really I could not find any middle
school pictures did I like hate my life
that much that I didn't take any photos
that actually it was not a joke I hated
my life in middle school worst times of
my life okay so I want to start off with
my favorite picture ever this is me and
my brother Johnny if you guys didn't
know I have two older brothers and an
older sister
this is Johnny and what I love so much
about this picture besides my own
existant eyebrows and my giant forehead
is that spoon like I'm not even joking
you that day I remember perfectly
my mom made the three of us me Johnny
Annie let my older brother Jani didn't
live with me he was my dad's son from
like a previous marriage at marriage and
he lives with his mom my mom made us all
go outside for like hours and take
pictures in front of this bush maybe it
was a new bush and she wanted to show it
off in photos but I did not want to take
the picture ha unless my spoon was
involved I'm not even joking I was like
I'll take the picture if I can
pose with this spoon I remember she was
like mama they used to call me mama she
was like well they still call me mama
she was like both I saw and I would not
I was like you want me to take this
picture my spoon is gonna be in this
picture or I'm not I'm not doing it
speaking of eyebrows a lot of people
like to comment on my videos telling me
well I mean there's a there's a few who
tell me things like girl your eyebrows
are terrible they're too thick and ugly
I like them but there's a lot of you
guys who like my eyebrows as well you
know like my Lily Collins vibe that I
try to go for every day because I want
to be just like her and you guys always
tell me how lucky I am to have eyebrows
but girl this is my eyebrows filled in I
did not get eyebrows till high school
I'm I'm joking to like my freshman year
of high school I'm going to show you
this beautiful little picture of me
graduating kindergarten and I'm going to
show you how non-existent my eyebrows
were I literally had blonde I browse and
like barely any hair I'm pretty sure
that I looked like an alien for a good
ten years of my life also let's take a
look at that side swept bangs there for
a second I mean come on she could have
done something with my hair for my
picture but she did however believe in
those tiny little stickers that you put
on pictures where it has like a little
bubble on top she had those on so many
pictures and apparently this day was a
dream come true
oh so he let had a face for some
weird-ass reason where she wore a wig
all the time she had bought this like
short brown haired wig and she wore it
constantly and I don't know why I still
don't get it
speaking of me that this is actually my
favorite picture of us I don't know how
he let having the personality that she
has because he'll I was like a fire ball
when she was younger but it makes for
good memories because her face looks
like she is so over it she's like but
the best the best part my favorite part
is my hair I look like Al Bundy's wife
this is by far my favorite like baby
llama baby in this picture but my
favorite like picture of me when I was
younger mainly because my bangs are
covering my massive forehead and -
because I think it's cute and I remind
myself a loose Khiladi that in this
picture if you have no idea who loose
gladdie that is google it because I
don't know how to clean it it's a novela
so here in this picture I'm a little
older this picture is actually really
really funny because the kid in the back
with the hat on was my best friend like
I'm talking like best friend like best
friend I've ever had in my entire life
in middle school and the other people in
this picture were all his friends but
actually have no idea who was like the
shorter guy is I don't I think that's
the one and only time I have ever seen
that kid and the girl directly behind me
was a girl that he had Lazzaro my best
friend had like a major crush on a
middle school but the girl next to me on
my left hated my guts like I'm pretty
like hated me like prettier that girl
threatened to like beat me up once and I
was like Lazzaro I am NOT taking a
picture these people aren't even my
friends I don't even know these people
he was like please come on so he paid
for all of us to take this picture just
so they could have a Valentine
Valentine's Day picture with all his
best friends I know he was cute like
that um you could see my face I'm like
can we get this over with
he actually got this for me my sophomore
year of high school because there's
something on because he knew my
addiction to friends it's my all-time
favorite show of all time I literally
know every episode word for word like
it's that serious and on Christmas one
year he showed up with this at my house
and I cried it says to Kathleen from
Lazzaro have a Merry Christmas my friend
I love you if this isn't the best gift
I've ever gotten in my life I don't know
what is okay so my dad loves to think
that I look nothing like him um like at
all which obviously if you guys have
seen my mom
I look like my mom but tell me I don't I
mean this is an old picture of my dad
where he has like uh looks like a killer
mustache like a serial killer mustache I
don't know why he had that mustache for
many years but he did but I feel like we
do look like like something in here like
I feel like I just I don't know am I
crazy or do I just want to look like him
let's take a look at my mom there for a
second who thinks she's in an 80s video
with that outfit and earrings and
hairstyle here's another little sticker
quote picture Amelia my best friend was
highly into that as well
she put those little stickers on
everything this is us in middle school
and let's talk about my bangs here I
actually got a comment the other day
saying oh my god you should really get
bangs because you would look really
pretty with bangs
and all I could think about was this
picture I was like no way am I going
down that road ever again
so this is a picture of me on Halloween
um my sister was I want to say like a
doll I don't know that was probably like
a little DIY thing she threw together
Janine is my cousin and she was like one
of those like a poodle skirt kind of
girls I don't know who that little
scooby boy is to be honest no idea who
that is and then I'm the little one in
the cowgirl outfit and nici which is
Janine's little sister my little cousin
she's Superman literally she didn't want
to be like a woman she wanted to be
Superman and I'm proud of her for it
here's another picture of Amelia
sporting that same old necklace of
seashells or whatever that is I don't
know paired off with hoops let's just
let's just point that out she's wearing
hoops and this is a really stupid
picture I don't know what I'm doing but
I just want to show you guys her phone
like can you take a look at this phone
how old is this phone let's talk about
bad choices when it comes to hair and
fashion again this is meet in the middle
school with friends actually don't speak
to anyone
except Stephanie who is the one right
next to me who is one of my best friends
ever I met her in middle school so
friendships do last hi Stephanie I love
you
look at my hair my hair was so curly oh
my hair is still really curly but from
so many years of straightening it this
is as curly as it gets um my hair was
like rapunzel Rapunzel
her hair's not curly Shirley Temple my
hair was Shirley Temple curly and I had
bangs I had the great idea of getting
bangs so I had to like iron my bangs
every morning and now looking back at
these pictures like how dumb did I look
with straight bangs and like curly hair
oh here's another picture of us Alette
and I dressed exactly the same we're
just sitting on our pool deck but my
favorite thing about this picture is my
face alrighty then there is you lip with
that wig again so one time he let had to
do like a drama course or something
where she had to like be a mine or had
to like put makeup on herself like if
she was in mine and I was her test dummy
um with the makeup she wanted to try the
mine makeup on me first to see and let's
just say that um drawing a mine face is
not elect strong suit
I don't look like a mime I look like a
dumbass with white paint on her face had
two black dots I don't stay far behind
though because actually the picture I'm
about to show you was Halloween I don't
exactly know how old it was I believe I
was like 12 or 12 I don't know people
say I look 12 now so who knows but I was
really really looking forward to this
costume I was like oh yeah I want to be
Frankenstein's bride or whatever this is
supposed to be the skeleton bright I
think that was yeah I was a skeleton
bride and I did my own makeup let's take
a look at that a scar on my forehead
does that look realistic or what I get a
lot of comments saying that I'm like
really really crazy all the time that my
personality is like so insane and I'm
like I in which I am how crazy do I look
in this photo oh my god is that a nip
slip Virginia didn't see that mmm
that's food ah this is a picture of
Farrah Fawcett just kidding that is my
mom thinking she's Farrah Fawcett and
again you go Farrah you go oh my god so
check my often in this picture I am like
laying down on my trampoline and I mean
the Fisher pans that's pretty bad too
the shirt is bad but I am wearing a
choker and see-through sunglasses like
clear like blue like a blue tint
sunglasses and I'm not even kidding
I thought they were the coolest
sunglasses in the entire world because
those are the glasses mary-kate and
Ashley wore in billboard dad and I
thought oh my god I'm freaking mary-kate
oh I think a lot of questions asking me
why I won't or like why my hair is in
short or why I always keep it long I had
short hair for many many years of my
life and having short super curly hair
is just really hard to deal with and
yeah I never like to brush my hair which
is why my mom cut it so short all the
time oh my gosh I had this big giant
doll it was like a stuffed
animal but it wasn't an animal was a
stuffed doll humongous and I would I
don't remember what I named her I know
she had a name but she would sleep on me
on my bed every single day and I would
braid her little braids like I would
take them apart and braid the braids and
sleep with her like every single night
and I would take her to my grandma's
house like in this picture at my my
grandma's house and I would take her
everywhere she was my best friend and I
loved her and I remember it got to a
point that she got so dirty that my mom
made me throw her away this is a picture
of Janine and I and my sister in the
middle Janine is the one with the shirt
that says hey mom will be jamun I just
wanted to show you that picture
specifically for that shirt hey mom
we've been jamun oh my gosh okay so this
picture I'm pretty sure it was like
preschool or kindergarten preschool
preschool this was preschool this is the
one and only picture I have of him this
is I'm like outside like in the
playground and the little head the
floating head behind the tree is Raphael
Rafi
I think was Raphael justice justice yeah
I was like in love with this little boy
like he was the love of my life I
remember like vividly seeing him one
time at Denny's and I like almost
fainted because he was at daddy's like a
couple booths down and I was like
freaking out
good times young and in love well I was
in love with him he was not in love with
me we had like a pool in our backyard
with like a pool deck and it was a lot
of fun
so this is me with not only do I have
like floaties on my arm but I'm holding
a floaty around my waist as well also
I'm pretty sure that I'm picking my
wedgie in this picture this is my
favorite picture of me up a whole time
don't I look crazy I love it I had like
a really big obsession with Bugs Bunny
like the Looney Tunes so I had like you
know the bedsheets back there I'm
holding onto bugs and I don't know what
I'm doing in this picture but I look
crazy crazy
which is why
it's so much also funny sorry I didn't
my mom always tried to make me eat
carrots when I was younger because you
know it's a vegetable moms and I never
wanted to eat them and she got me to eat
a bunch of carrots when I was little
because she told me Bugs Bunny liked
them I was like Bugs Bunny likes them
and I must like them too
she used to refer to them as whatcha
Docs which for Hispanic who can barely
speak English that was my mom trying to
say what's up doc you know like what's
up doc bugs
she called little carrots watching ducks
okay never mind this is never mind oh so
this is a picture again I'm always
matching with like everyone right so
this a picture of Janine in the back and
me see my younger cousin in the front
Superman um and she really didn't want
to take this picture I look very excited
to take this picture and she is just
like not having it oh my gosh so this is
a picture of being my best friend
Lazzaro and my boyfriend at the time
George George was my first boyfriend
ever you guys are seeing my first
boyfriend ever and he was my first kiss

fifteens together oh that's so cool I'm
