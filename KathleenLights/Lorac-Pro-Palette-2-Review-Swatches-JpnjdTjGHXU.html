a review and swatches on the new lorac
Pro palette - I want to call it lorac
pro 2
but it's the lorac Pro palette - I got
this about a week ago
and now is when I'm able to sit down and
film the review and swatches for you
guys so I have used it a couple of times
and I do have my thoughts on it so I
will be sharing with you everything I
think about this palette so when you
first buy it it comes in this box like
this just like the original Pro palette
and it comes with a tiny little sample
of their behind the scenes eye primer
this stuff will last you forever even
though it's a little tube it will last a
long time because I'm still not
completely done with the one that came
with my original Pro palette and this is
probably my favorite eye primer of all
time so this will last a really long
time so it's great that it comes with
this the palette itself is worth $42 and
that is a great deal considering you get
sixteen eyes shadows so this is what the
actual palette looks like on the inside
it comes with a sticker over the mirror
which I have taken out it comes with a
pretty good sized mirror the packaging
is just like the original lorac pro the
lorac pro one which is this one right
here so if you're familiar with this one
you're going to be familiar with this
one it's the exact same packaging the
only difference is that this one is
black and this one is great and actually
prefer that this one is great because as
you can tell I don't if you can tell on
camera the lorac pro gets dirty fast
it's like all finger print II that's a
word
it's very frequency I feel like this one
won't get as dirty because it's great no
I'm saying so just like the original pro
palette the top row has only matte
shadows and the bottom row has shimmery
sha
I love the shimmery shadows because they
don't have like any chunks of glitter in
them so the first one right here is
called buff and it is a matte yellowy
color this is the perfect brow bone
highlight if you don't want to highlight
your brow bone with a shimmery shade and
what I absolutely love about this one is
it's so so pigmented all the eyeshadows
in this palette are pigmented but I was
really impressed with this one
specifically because if you guys are
familiar with the Naked 2 palette or The
Naked basics palette from Urban Decay
they have a color called foxy and
they're pretty much kind of the same
color when you look at them they're like
that matte yellow color only foxy does
not show up on my skin at all I don't
know if it's just not pigmented enough
or what it just doesn't show up so when
I first saw this color I was like oh
it's gonna be another foxy for me but
it's not actually does show up on my
skin and it's pigmented enough to where
it shows up it's really pigmented and
buttery I love this color a lot more
than I thought I would so that one is
buff the next one is light brown and
this one is the perfect crease color
this is the color I have in my crease
right now and this just blends out any
eyeshadow beautifully it is your perfect
crease color it's not too dark it's not
too light it's perfection and I think
any skin tone can use this in their
crease then you have cool grey which is
a really pretty
matte gray color but it has a little bit
of a purple undertone because down the
line you have one called charcoal which
is a more true gray color the cool grey
has a little bit of like a warm purple
undertone I don't know how to explain it
like some mauve is in there then we have
nectar and I love this color so much
more than I thought it I would it is
such a pretty midtone pink it reminds me
a lot of makeup geeks cupcake eye shadow
it's a really pretty shade it's an
alternative to brown so if you don't
want to use Brown in your crease like
you always do
nectar is a nice alternative to just
have a little bit of a pink in your
crease then we have this color right
here called plum and it is a beautiful
beautiful matte purple shade it's a deep
purple and it actually comes off purple
it's pigmented then this
color right here which is probably the
standout color in the entire palette
this color was the reason I wanted to
get this palette in the first place it
is called Navy and it is such a
beautiful deep navy color I have come
across so many Navy colors that have so
much shimmer in them like a lot of the
navy blue colors are just really really
shimmery I haven't come across a really
really good matte navy color and this is
it this is so so pigmented and so
buttery if you want a super super
intense Navy look just add a blue base
and this will make it pop then we have
the color charcoal this is the one I was
telling you about earlier it's just a
basic dark matte gray then we have this
one right here and it is the color black
this is the only eyeshadow in the
palette that I have a problem with
because it is labeled black but it's not
this is like a really really really
really really dark gray I wish that they
would come out with like a really really
dark black color kind of like makeup
eeks corrupt or black out from the Urban
Decay Naked palette make it naked 2
palette because even in the original Pro
palette that black color it's the same
color they're both black but it's not
super super black so I really wish they
would have come out with a super deep
black but also it could be a good thing
because I use this black color on my
outer crease today it's great it's a
perfect black for a beginner you know
like it's really really easy to build up
and you don't get too carried away too
quickly so it's not like a black start
line so it might be good for some people
it might be bad for others overall it's
it's a decent color and I like it I use
it I just wish it would've been a little
bit blacker now to the shimmers the
first one is called snow and it is just
a basic shimmery white color I don't
tend to go for these colors often just
because I don't like that stark white
shimmery shade but for those of you who
like that really intense white look in
the inner corners or underneath the brow
bone this is perfect then we have the
color beige I love this color I love it
so much more than I thought I would
it is so pigmented like
immediately when you put your finger in
this color like so much pigment comes
off and it's not chalky not powdery it's
super super smooth it's that perfect
light champagne beige color it's
beautiful today as my brow bone
highlight and my inner corner highlight
and it just opens up the eyes and it's
so like shimmery in such a pretty pretty
way love that color then comes rose and
it is your basic rose gold I love that
they added a shade like this because it
is so so gorgeous on the lid I have worn
this just on my entire lid put on some
mascara and went out the door and it
looks absolutely beautiful love it
then we have mocha this is probably my
favorite eyeshadow in the entire palette
it's what I have underneath my eyes
today it's like what I have so much on
my lower lashline and I cannot describe
this eyeshadow it's like oh my god it's
the most beautiful eyeshadow I have ever
seen maybe not I've ever seen but it is
a gorgeous gorgeous eyeshadow so pretty
this would look really pretty on your
entire lid as well then we have a chrome
and it reminds me a lot of Mac's satin
taupe I could be wrong but just right
off the bat it looks a lot like Mac
satin taupe it's that really pretty
taupe color that has a little bit of
silver a little bit of purple in it it's
like a duochrome eat Cromie color it's
really really gorgeous then we have
silver and it's just your basic silver
color it's really really intense though
very very shiny and it's a nice silver
my stuff is Jade this is the color I
have on my entire lid today only it
looks a little bit more emerald on my
eyelids because I had a emerald color as
a base so I came off a little bit more
like an beroldy
here it's a little bit more olivey but
it's still such a beautiful color my
makeup is not very summery at all but I
really wanted to play with the Jade
color today and I love it I
typically hate green eyeshadow on me
because I feel like it clashes with my
eye color I don't really like it but
this color is so beautiful I love those
foresty warm greens and that one is
gorgeous and then last step we have this
color right here called cocoa and I'm
really glad that they included a color
like this because it is a deep brown
with a little bit of shimmer and it's
perfect for the outer corners like if
you want to do something like mocha or
rose all over the lid and just add a
little bit of cocoa on the outer corners
it would look really really pretty I
look at they added a really deep
beautiful like chocolaty Brown like that
those are my favorite I just I love it
oh yeah those were my close up swatches
of the palette I hope the swatches were
good enough now on my thoughts I think
this palette is phenomenal I think that
they outdid themselves it is just as
good as the lorac pro if you are a huge
fan of this palette and don't know if
you should get this one I say go for it
because they are really different in my
opinion this one is a little bit more
warm toned a little bit more like golden
e and you know warmer and this one is a
little bit more cool toned but they also
do have their warm colors in there this
one I think is a little bit more
versatile because you have like your
Silver's and your taupe sand your Gray's
but you also have your like rose gold
and browns and you have a brown crease
color when it comes to the matte
eyeshadows in the palette though I got
to give it to my boy the original Pro
palette because I think that these mats
are better not in terms of pigmentation
but the fact that you get a variety of
different brands and more eyeshadows
that you would use on a daily basis yeah
the plum is beautiful and the charcoal
and the navy and their great colors but
I feel like when it comes to the mattes
this one has more that you would use on
a regular basis but when it comes to the
shimmery eyeshadows I've got to say I
like these better
even though I think this light bronze
color is like God's gift to earth I love
gold and I love garnet I love every
single shade down here they are so
beautiful Rose mocha chrome Jade cocoa
beige they're just so so beautiful and
you have a variety of warm and cool I
love love love love the shimmery
eyeshadows in this palette so when it
comes to which one I prefer it depends
on the day
it really does if I'm going to go with
something really basic natural warm I'm
gonna go for this one but I've been
loving this and I've loved to play
around with it it's so amazing so I
think that if you have this one it is
worth the money getting this one it is
personally I know that when I got the
Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I regretted
it like a year later because I never saw
myself gravitating towards it but I see
myself using this one all the time this
is a good one guys this is a really
great palette definitely worth the money
when you think about each individual
eyeshadow it really isn't that expensive
so a plus on packaging a plus on
pigmentation and pulls on everything
lorac you go you go girl because this is
the best the best palette lorac has ever
come out with they're just as good as
each other
they're great I love them I love them
both so yeah those were my thoughts and
swatches on the lorac Pro palette 2 I
love it I hope you guys do too um yeah
