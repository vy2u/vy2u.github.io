a hits and misses video but we are going
to be talking about luxury make up very
very very very pricey makeup and in my
eyes the way I see it is you have
drugstore makeup or affordable makeup in
one category then you have high-end
makeup which is a Kat Von D to face
Becca Tarte bare minerals NARS those
kinds of brands and then you have the
luxury makeup which is like Tom Ford
Dior Burberry girl on Xuan she trying
Tilbury YSL giorgio armani those kinds
of brands that are even pricier than Mac
or Too Faced or any of those brands so
those are the friends I will be talking
about today I have gotten so many
requests lately to review more high-end
more luxury makeup and I don't really
love to do that now for any specific
reason it's just I don't really like to
shop in the luxury makeup I like Dior
doesn't call my name as much as Too
Faced does it's just personal preference
I rather shop those aisles versus those
aisles but I take all my subscribers
into consideration and even though I do
a lot of affordable makeup looks I
thought I would buy a bunch of luxury
makeup and put it to the test now I have
been buying all of these products
throughout a few months I think I've
been gathering some of these for about
six months now
and I tried them off-camera and I have
my thoughts on them and I have to give
my disclaimer if you are someone who
really really hates luxury makeup if
you're someone who would never spend
that kind of money on makeup it's not
worth it it's pointless then this video
is not for you and trust me I feel the
same way if it wasn't for my youtube
channel I would have no desire
personally to shove these brands but my
life is makeup now my whole life is
makeup now so I thought I would try
these out if you're someone who's like
nope not my thing just please no
negative comments just click out of the
video I have more affordable videos on
my channel and trust me I won't be
making this a habit but for those of you
who love luxury makeup love buying it or
even if you don't love buying it you
like hearing about it this video is for
you but I will say I'm going to be
brutally honest I mean I'm always honest
in my videos but because of the prices
of some of these products some of these
prices are so ridiculous I just have to
be extra brutal with them because a lot
of these are not worth
the money so I do have to split this
video up into two parts because I have a
crap ton of stuff let me know if you
even want to see part two maybe you're
just not interested in this kind of
video at all so you don't want to see a
part two but let me know but I'm gonna
go in categories of brands so in today's
video I'm gonna be talking about Tom
Ford Burberry girl on cogent dough and
then miscellaneous like I have one
product from Givenchy and one product
from La Prairie la Prairie is stupid
expensive I bought one thing and then if
you want to see it part two I will be
talking about Giorgio Armani Chanel Dior
Charlotte Tilbury and YSL so let me know
if you do want to see part two oh yeah
without further ado let's get started on
Tom Ford okay so the first thing I want
to talk about is something I don't think
is worth it at all out of all the Tom
Ford products I purchased this is the
one I like the least this is the Tom
Ford you know that I color quad in the
shade nude dip now when it comes to
luxury makeup the packaging is
phenomenal like look at this look at the
stunning packaging and of course it gets
points for that because I'm a packaging
junkie I love nice packaging but I don't
like this at all this is what I have on
my eyes today for the money I don't
think it's worth it this is eighty two
dollars that's way more than a Too Faced
chocolate bar palette way more than
Naked palette it's so overpriced and I
know it's Tom Ford I'm aware but the
pigmentation on these eyeshadows is not
as good as Too Faced it's not as good as
makeup geek even makeup geek that's like
six dollars an eyeshadow the only eye
shadow I do think is really really nice
is this chocolatey color right here it's
an average eyeshadow palette you only
get four eyeshadows basically you're
just paying for the really amazing
packaging in my opinion I just don't
ever see myself reaching for this which
bums me out because I paid a pretty
penny okay so this next product I
actually really loved and I was so
shocked that I liked it so and I'm
actually so bummed that I like it so
much because that's expensive this is
the bronzing powder in the shade
Terra I came out with they're like
summer collection I believe because it's
in this really beautiful white and gold
packaging just open it up like this
and this is the bronzer this is what I
use today to contour I do have another
bronzer on top that I'll talk about in a
little bit but when I bought this and I
touched it for the first time I was like
oh it doesn't really feel that great I
have a feeling I'm not gonna like this
it might be a little patchy but I don't
know if it's the color I think it's a
mixture of the undertone and the formula
I love the look it gives my face it
contours but then it also makes me look
a little bit tan I don't know it's
awesome it's stunning at $68 which is
absolutely ridiculous
I don't know if I'll rate honestly I
don't know if I'll repurchase any of
these things if I go through them I
don't know because I have a ton of
bronzers in my collection that I love
just as much as this so I'm not sure but
this is something that I'm not upset I
bought and I have a feeling I'm gonna
use it all up because I think it is so
so beautiful so this is one of these
products that I'm like it's whatever
this is the cheek color in the shade
love lust there's actually a really
pretty blush I think it looks really
nice on the cheeks the only thing I
don't love is that it's a little bit
powdery when you dip your brush in you
get like that kick up and I don't really
love that because sometimes it can look
a little bit powdery on my skin I don't
care about kick up when it comes to
eyeshadows but for blush that's not my
favorite
the one thing I do love about this is
the packaging because a lot of high-end
blushes when you open it it comes with
like a tiny little brush and then you
get like a little little thing of blush
and I hate that about luxury blushes but
this one doesn't do that you get a whole
pan of blush I would categorize this
product doesn't yeah it's not bad but
it's not amazing either next product is
I'm trying to go through these products
really quickly because I have so much to
talk about next product is the eye
defining pen in the shade deeper now
this is amazing
I heard nikkietutorials rave about this
and then I ran and purchased it because
I wanted to include in this video and
I'm so glad I did because it's actually
fabulous you get two sides right here
you get kind of like a longer brush tip
and then on this side you get more of a
shorter felt tip so you have like your
two options I use this today to do my
wing and it was so easy to do a wing I
was shocked there's something about this
brush
tip that's even better than the Kat Von
D which is probably like a ride-or-die
product for me and then I did my little
flick with the short felt side it was
really easy to control because it is so
tiny these are one of those products
that if you are looking into Tom Ford
makeup try out the liquid liner I don't
think you'll regret it it's pricey but
wow really really great my next product
is something that I've heard everyone
talk about recently this is their
lipstick in the shade of blush nude Tom
Ford lipsticks are probably the most
beautiful packaging I've ever seen I
love black and gold Tom Ford can do no
wrong when it comes to packaging
honestly I actually really really really
love this color I'm wearing it today I
have a lip gloss on top and I love the
way it smells so many luxury brands love
to make their lipsticks smell like
chemicals or like a powdery floral scent
I don't love that floral scent this one
smells like vanilla I have a cold so I'm
really really stuffy but yeah it smells
like vanilla and the formula is actually
really nice it lasts a very very very
long time on my lips now with that being
said this is a fifty three dollar
lipstick and if I'm going to be
completely honest I think the NARS
audacious lipsticks are better and they
last longer those lipsticks are also
pricey but they're thirty-three dollars
I think compared to fifty so if you are
looking for an amazing creamy high
quality high-end lipstick I would go
with the NARS audacious but for what
it's worth this is a great great
lipstick and then my last Tom Ford
product is the skin illuminating powder
duo in the shade moonlight mood light
excuse me this is what it looks like
it's just a highlighting palette with
two colors you get like a white creamy
color and then a stunning champagne opal
kind of color I have a mixture of these
two highlights on my cheekbones today
but I had another highlight on top this
I don't know how to feel about it a part
of me really really loves it and then a
part of me thinks like I mean as well as
royalty I kind of feel like the texture
of this isn't as smooth but it's so
pretty I don't know but I do like the
fact that you get two different colors
this color is stunning if they just sold
this color
individually by itself then I would
think it's worth it because maybe they
would lower the price but this color
right here doesn't Wow me the way that
this one does it's beautiful and I like
the mixture of both but this one when I
swatch it it just kind of looks like
nothing really it's I don't know do I
love it or do I not I can't decide oh no
there's one more time for a product I
want talking about and I actually don't
like this at all no it's not that I
don't like it I just don't think it's
worth the money this is the Tom Ford
cream powder I color in the shade naked
bronze this is one of those products
that when you open it has the powder eye
shadow right here and then when you open
the bottom it has a cream eyeshadow this
goes on the eyes so beautifully I think
it is stunning
it's a very very good product but I
think there's too many dupes on the
market to make this worth it for example
the dose of colors ideal duo's are way
way way way way cheaper and they kind of
give you the same vibe the only
difference is on the top of the dose of
color ones you get the cream and then
you get the powder eye shadow on the
bottom versus the Tom Ford it's kind of
like reversed the Tom Ford one is bigger
and you probably get more products but
how often do you go through like
something like this not very often
there's also an Estee Lauder one that
dupes it as well I just think there are
too many dupes to make this worth it in
my personal opinion okay so the next
brand I want to talk about is girl on am
I saying that right girl lane girl on
I'm not sure I only have three products
to talk about I just didn't know what to
buy I heard a lot of people talk about
Tom Ford so I knew what I wanted to get
actually one of these things I've heard
people rave about which is why I bought
it let's talk about that first okay the
first brillouin product I want to talk
about is this right here this is the
radiance concentrate with pure gold
makeup base this is the girl on primer
that has literally literally gold flecks
in it oh my god this this is expensive
for a face primer what it's crazy it's
crazy I don't think it's worth the money
but only only because of my skin when I
saw Tottie's video she had put it on and
I even saw it like I saw her video and I
could tell that one side of her face I
think she did it on like
her vase it looked firmer so immediately
I was like whoa that is so worth the
price if it does that so worth the price
but personally for me I didn't really
get that effect I didn't notice much of
a difference everybody has different
experiences with products I know people
love and rave about this but for me it
kind of felt like a hydrating water
essence if you are someone who you
really like firming products or you
really want to lift to your skin you
might really really love this it's just
not something that it's not for me okay
let's talk about a girl um product that
oh my gosh I love this is my favorite my
new favorite brow gel or brow whatever
this is the master brow groom girl
honors you Vaughn Chi now I'm super
confused oh my god no this is Givenchy
oh this isn't girl on sorry just kidding
okay we're gonna talk about that later I
guess we have to she bugged she products
in this video well so I only have one
more girl on product auch about well I
am so unprofessional on product I
actually do really love as well this is
the lingerie Depot invisible skin fusion
foundation with sunscreen SPF 20 this
foundation is beautiful this looks
stunning on the skin it has amazing
reviews on Sephora which is why I bought
it and I agree with everyone just read
those reviews it's crazy it looks so
pretty and smooth it really just smooths
out my skin and it looks so nice it's a
beautiful glass bottle it has a pump so
a-plus for that and even though it has
SPF 20 I don't feel like it leaves a
white cast I think it looks stunning
okay let's talk about the to Siobhan she
products because I thought this was girl
on and I'm a dork this is the Givenchy
master bra room brow gel this brow gel
is my favorite clear brow gel hands-down
my favorite color brown gel will always
be the Loreal brow stylist plumper but
when it comes to like a clear gel this
is my favorite this is my holy grail
it's amazing I love to do kind of like a
feathery brow look where you really
brush up your brows and they kind of
look a little bit bushy and feathery I
like that look I think it's so like
Romeo and Juliet
and whenever I do that with any clear
brow gel if they fall throughout the day
they kind of go back to my natural
looking brows throughout the day this
one keeps them up and feathery the
entire day I love this
much I think it's so worth it I will
repurchase this once I run out of it
this is something that I think it's
hands down so worth the money I also
really love that it's not goopy I have
so many clear brow gels that when you
take it out when you start to apply it
to your brows you get like wet eyebrows
this doesn't do that I cannot recommend
this enough I also bought it in the
shade brunette this one is transparent
but I don't like the brunette shade as
much as this one so I'm super bummed out
about that I think it's way too hard
from I mean that's just way too dark for
my brows okay and then the last jumanji
product I have is the healthy glow
powder bronzer in the shade number 4 is
the packaging so beautiful and then when
you open it this is the bronzer this is
the bronzer I have on top of the
tomforde bronzer today I actually really
really like this I really like the
formula this is a very similar formula
to the Make Up For Ever Pro bronzed
fusion this one in the shade number 4
gives you such a beautiful Sheen to the
face in a very subtle natural way like
it's dark it's dark but it applies
really soft and glowy and so so pretty I
really like this bronzer it's expensive
but it's so so pretty I really like it
ok let's talk about Burberry makeup and
there's actually one product that I'm
not including in this video because I
gave it away and I didn't like it at all
it was the Burberry uhm glowy shimmery
primer I didn't like it at all I kind of
looked glittery on my face I just I was
not into it so I gave it to my sister
and I don't even know if she likes it or
not but it wasn't for me and if I'm
gonna be completely honest with you
Burberry is one of those brands that I
struggle with I love the packaging but
it's I don't know I don't want to talk
about these too long because I think
there were limited edition yeah this was
the spring and summer run away palettes
in number one white and number two nude
gold this is what they look like they
look similar on camera but they're
completely different colors I love this
shade I think it goes on so beautiful on
the cheekbones stunning this one I don't
really like that much it looks white and
chunky on my cheeks if you were someone
who couldn't get this and you're bummed
out about it I wouldn't be too sad about
it it's really not that great I would
highly recommend
and Becca's purl highlight it's also a
white shimmery highlight but it's much
much prettier than this one let's talk
about something that I do love love love
this is the Burberry cat lashes mascara
and I got mine in chestnut brown and
maybe a major reason why I love this
mascara so much is the fact that it's
brown I think it's so pretty
I love the color every time I put on
this mascara I'm like oh my gosh I love
my lashes but I also really love the
formula - I love that it's called cat
lashes because that's what I feel like
when I put it on the wand is so nice and
it's flexible but not too flexible to
the point where I can't wiggle in there
you don't I'm saying it's very
volumizing I think it looks so pretty
and I love the chestnut brown because
it's not too light it's brown but it's a
dark brown but you can tell it's brown I
really really really like this this next
product you've heard me talk about
before and that I mentioned I didn't
really like it this is the light glow
natural blush in the shade earthy blush
number 7 this is what I'm talking about
people
why do luxury brands do this you'll be
fooled into thinking wow that's a huge
blush I'm gonna open this and it's gonna
be beautiful and big and then you're
like nobody I like it I think it's a
really pretty color with a hint of pink
it's nice
I just realized holy crap I'm stuffy and
I can smell this this smells like
Colonia oh my god my childhood just like
came back into my mind that's crazy the
smell is really beautiful but maybe if
you're sensitive to super fragrant
blushes you might not like this I love
natural blush you guys know I'm into a
very natural looking blush but I don't
like the fact that it's so small I
didn't use the brush here so I just like
tossed a I don't know I don't I don't
know I don't like it that much
sorry I just don't like it that much I
can't pretend I can't pretend and then
the last Burberry product I have is the
kisses gloss in the shade nude beige
number 17 I don't want to sound so
negative in this video this is the lip
gloss I'm wearing right now and it is
super pretty it's really really pretty
but I don't think it's glossy enough the
packaging is so stunning but I love my
buxom glosses way more and they're more
affordable and if I'm going to be honest
I would probably reach for my
colour-pop glasses over this one and
those glasses are like six dollars it's
a beautiful color but it doesn't last
that long
it smell like anything it doesn't smell
bad not chemically smelling if I give
you major points for that but there's
better glasses on the market okay so
we're almost done with part one I have
four more products to talk about three
from Coach endo and one from la Prairie
I don't want to talk about the coach
endo spa water makeup remover wipes in
this video because I've talked about
them in the past I love those literally
my favorite wipes ever are the Kosh endo
cleansing spa water wipes amazing I
think they're super saturated super
amazing I love them but let's talk about
a co gentle product I don't love I told
this is the moisture foundation I hate
this I feel very strongly about how much
I don't like this it's very very pricey
it's like $60 it's tiny I mean you get
do you get one ounce its point seventy
one ounces so it's not a full ounce it's
not tiny that was dramatic but it's like
60 bucks and it looks so drying on my
skin I mean I'm going through something
right now
my whole forehead all the way down to
here like all of this is full really dry
bumpy pimples so my skin is even drier
than ever so maybe it was a bad time to
test this but it looks so drying on my
skin I don't like this the coverage
isn't that great I don't know I don't
like this at all and I'm sorry but so
not worth the money there's so many
foundations on the market that are way
way better than this just not a fan at
all but a foundation that is from
coercion know that I think is
ridiculously worth the money is the aqua
foundation this is the foundation I'm
wearing on my skin right now I have a
powder foundation on top that I'll talk
about in part two if you want to see
part two but this foundation is
beautiful this in the shade two one
three and it kind of has a little bit of
an olive undertone it looks just
slightly green on me until I put on the
rest of my makeup but I love this I love
this foundation so much out of all the
luxury foundations I've ever tried this
is my favorite it's around the same
price as their moisture Tommy doesn't
waste rice but it's so much better so
much better I even love the packaging
way more laconic
fantasy that's beautiful it looks like
my skin had a drink of water when I
apply this like I said earlier I've had
really bad dry issues
and this doesn't emphasize my dryness at
all it looks flawless on the skin so not
like to do we but it gives you a
beautiful dewy finish and I highly
recommend it I think it is worth the
money and then the last question no
product I want to talk about I also
really love this is their aqua
foundation illuminator this is in the
shade sheer beige this looks beautiful
mixed in any foundation
I like the Becca liquid illuminators but
I like this more because it isn't as
thick this one is a little bit more
runny and it's a little bit more
forgiving when you mix it in with
products I've never really tried this on
its own I've used it as a primer and
mixed in with foundation and that's how
I like it I really really really love
this it's a pricey liquid illuminator
but I think it's so beautiful and then
the last product I'm going to talk about
is shocking and shocking in terms of
price and unfortunately I'm going to end
this video on a negative note because I
don't like it and I might be the only
one who doesn't like it this is the LA
Prairie cellular treatment powder
foundation this is $95 I don't know what
I was thinking
but I saw his video and she her WTF
series is so fun for me to watch even
though I don't really buy luxury makeup
I love watching it and when I saw her
apply this I was like that has an
amazing coverage I need to buy that for
this video but I'm gonna film and I
thought I was gonna love it but I don't
love it first of all I don't think the
packaging is that great it's it's freaky
plastic like so is the Tom Ford one but
I I don't know I whatever nobody cares
that's just me being super picky but I
have mine in the shade of beige door and
even though this gives really really
beautiful coverage like I'm talking like
full coverage this is a full coverage
powder foundation this covers a lot it
sits on top of my skin like I said
earlier I'm having skin issues maybe if
my skin gets better in the future I will
try it out again but it looks like it's
sitting on top of my skin like I could
literally see it like I look in the
mirror and I'm like oh my god my skin
looks so powdery that happens if I apply
a little bit or if I apply a lot of it
it doesn't matter it does not sit on top
of my pimples well at all it kind of
collects a dry ring around each pimple I
know it sounds
really gross but it makes my pimples
look dusty and I don't like it I don't
like it at all for my skin type this
isn't the best maybe if you have oily
skin you would really like this
I know Casey Holmes raves about this but
for my skin type it did not work for me
so so bummed about that because that's
expensive that that's not expensive
that's s-pen okay guys so that completes
this video this is part one of my luxury
makeup it's and missus I'm sorry if this
video seems negative but there were a
few products that I thought were really
really great I'm gonna go and film part
two right now but let me know if you
want to see part two you know let me
