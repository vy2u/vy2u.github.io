video if you like Duke videos I have
been wanting to do a mac lipstick Duke
video for a pretty long time now just
because I think they're so helpful and
not everybody wants to go out and spend
the money on you Mac lipstick but would
still want a similar color and now we
they could find it at the drugstore now
I will say some of these dupes may not
be like spot-on identical but they're
close enough I've tried to find the
closest match that I can and if you
liked this video comment down below and
let me know so that I can do more mac
lipstick dupes for the other lipsticks
in my collection I'm not just going to
be swatching the lipsticks on my hand I
will be showing you actual lip swatches
cuz I'm a nice girl like that and by the
way if I look different I decided to go
a little bit bolder on my brows and I I
don't know how I feel about them I I was
channeling my inner Lily Collins cuz
she's a lo of my life so I tried but it
might look a little weird anyway not
that that has anything to do with this
video so if you want to see some MAC
lipstick dupes keep watching
so the first lipstick is Mac's syrup and
the closest dubai found in my collection
is the Revlon just bitten kissable balm
stain in honey they look just slightly
different but they're very very similar
next up is velvet teddy this is one of
my favorite colors and I swear the
wet-and-wild lipstick and bear it all is
pretty much exactly the same very close
bear it all is just a little bit more
Brown the next lipstick is maxed viva
glam Nikki and I'm pretty sure this was
limited edition and wet and wild Pinker
Belle is pretty much the exact same
lipstick like I cannot tell the
difference between the two they are
identical
next up is max ravishing and the closest
dupe I found in my collection was the
Revlon smoked peach lipstick now the
Revlon one is just a little bit more
peachy while ravishing has the hint more
of pink but they are very very similar
next is max so shot this is where my
favorite lipstick and what in wild
pretty persimmon is pretty much the
exact same color as well you can find a
lot of Mac dupes in the wet and wild and
mega last line
next is max snob and the Duke is the
Revlon lipstick in pink pout pink Pao is
just a little bit darker snob has a
little bit more of a pink to it but
they're so incredibly similar even in
the tube
next up is more enjoy maca notice
intense intense orange and Milani sweet
nectar is literally pretty sure the
exact same lipstick next up is max girl
about town and the closest dupe I found
for it was the NYX soft matte lip cream
in addis ababa the only difference is
the finish the next one is matte while
girl about town is an amplified cream so
they do have a different finish but
pretty much the same color next up is
max russian red and the duke I found is
Revlon's matte balm in standout Russian
red is just a little a darker
and then finally in this video is max
rebel and the dupe I found is the wet
and wild megalast lipstick in sugarplum
fairy ok guys so that is the end of this
video I really do hope you enjoyed it
and let me know down below what you
thought thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
