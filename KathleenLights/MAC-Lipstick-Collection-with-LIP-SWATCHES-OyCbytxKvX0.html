you my entire matte lipstick collection
I'm doing this video because a few
people have requested it um disclaimer I
am NOT trying to brag in any way it's
just MAC lipsticks are my thing and I
really like collecting them and they're
the one thing that I do splurge on and
keep in mind that I've been collecting
these lipsticks since high school and
I'm aware that I probably have more than
I should I have a lot of them and I
don't think that anybody needs this many
MAC lipsticks because there are a lot of
good lipsticks at the drugstore but like
I said it's something I love collecting
and MAC lipsticks are probably my
favorite makeup product ever so I had to
mention that little disclaimer I don't
want people thinking I'm showing off or
anything like I said it was requested I
did do this video it was like my first
video I did it was my favorite permanent
one to do like my top 10 favorite
permanent MAC lipsticks and that video
was dreadful
it's like black halfway through the
video because I didn't realize that the
Sun would completely away and I was like
out of the frame it was bad so I'm going
to show you all of the ones that I own
keep in mind that some of these are
limited edition but they reap remote MAC
lipsticks all the time oh I'm also going
to be doing lip swatches so you're going
to see all of the lipsticks on my lips I
do think that you get a better look of
the color if you see it on my lips and
if I were to swatch it on my hands I
don't know I think that lip swatches are
better so that's why I did that so if
you want to see my entire MAC lipstick
collection then keep watching so this
first lipstick is a sheen supreme
lipstick and it is the only one I own it
is very scary on the lips as you can see
but it is very pretty in the tube I like
to mix this up with other lipsticks this
next one i depotted into this tiny
little fat container it is called pretty
please it is a luster formula lustre
lipsticks are probably my favorite
formula that Mac has this is my most
purchased lipstick I've bought it over
four times I wore it every day in high
school I love it
this next lipstick is called naturally
eccentric it is also a luster formula it
came out with the surf baby collection
which means it is limited edition but it
is my favorite pale nude it looks so
great with a really smoky eye
this next one is called myth it is a
satin formula I love this lipstick I
think it suits more fair skin tones
because it can wash you out a little
this next one is called creme de nude
and I think that this one suits
everybody it isn't so pale like myth is
it's just a very nice basic all-around
perfect nude this one is called playing
coy it's a satin finish I do not like
this lipstick that much as you can see
from my face I don't look like I like it
I'm trying to figure out how to wear it
how it doesn't look cakey on my lips but
I don't know
this next lipstick is called Q and it is
a glaze formula it looks really dark in
the tube but it is it's just a nice
basic duty pink lip
this next one came out with the hey
sailor collection it is called salute
it's an amplified formula this is just
your basic peach lipstick I was at a fan
of it at first because it can't settle
it's the little lines on your lips but
it is a very nice color
this next one is also a limited-edition
lipstick it's called peach stop it is a
satin formula and I believe it came out
with the liberty of London collection I
believe that's what the name was and I
love it because it's a very wearable
brownie nude but it's toned down this
next one is called aimed oh it is a
frost finish but for some reason it
doesn't look frosting on the lips at all
it's just your basic everyday pink
this next one is called cream cup and it
is very similar to angel only to me it's
a little lighter
this one is velvet teddy and it is a
matte formula I love this lipstick
because even though it is a very brown
nude there's a hint of pink to it
this next one is called taupe and it is
also matte and it's very similar to
velvet teddy only while velvet teddy has
a pink undertone
this one has a red undertone
this one is called syrup and it is a
Buster formula
Hilary Duff posted a picture of her
wearing this lipstick on Twitter one day
and I immediately went out and bought it
because it looked beautiful on her I
really love that this lipstick is pink
and purple and just very wearable and
it's good for everyday
this next one is called snob and it is a
satin formula it is very pink but it has
it's like pastel e purple undertone it
looks very purple on my lips okay this
is gonna scare you guys
this is my broken Viva Glam Gaga
lipstick it is a luster formula and it
makes me very sad that it's all
destroyed because to me it's the perfect
baby
this one is saint-germain it is an
amplified formula and it came out with
the quite cute collection so it was
limited edition but it is a very pastel
e pink but it's also very bright at the
same time this one came out with that
same Liberty of London collection I
mentioned earlier and it is also
destroyed yeah I love this lipstick it's
called blooming lovely it's an amplified
cream and it kills me that it's messed
up because I'm just waiting for them to
reap remote it because I think it's such
a beautiful purple this next tip stick
has probably the prettiest packaging
I've ever seen on the lipstick it came
out with the Wonder Woman collection
obviously it is called Spitfire and it
is a satin formula I do love this
lipstick because it has berry undertones
like there's a hint of cranberry in that
purple somewhere I love it
this next one is called Violetta and it
is an amplified cream it is a very very
unique purple because it has like dual
chrome in it somewhere I don't know it's
a fuchsia and a purple and I think it
just it stands out
this one is girl about town it is also
an amplified cream it is your typical
hot pink but with some purple undertones
next is the beautiful candy yum-yum it
is a matte formula this is a very neon
pink and for some reason on camera it
doesn't look as neon as it does in real
life it's a lot brighter in person the
same goes for this next lipstick which
is the Viva Glam Niki lipstick it is a
satin formula and it is very very very
bright in person and it's not picking up
its neon effect on camera
this one is called ravishing and it is a
cream Shane
it's a beautiful coral peachy orange II
I don't know I don't know how to
describe this lipstick but it's one of
my favorites
this one is called Costa Sheikh it is a
frost but it does not look frosty on the
lips I love it because it's a bright
coral and I think that it looks really
nice with green eyes you can't really
tell here I'm looking in the viewfinder
but yeah this one is called impassion it
is an amplifying cream and it is a very
bright pink but not as bright as candy
yum yum it's not neon it's just a very
pretty bright pink this one is fusion
pink and it's very similar to Violetta
in the sense that it has a gate
duochrome II look it looks red in some
angles and it looks pink in some angles
I think it's very unique
this one is more inch and it is an
amplified cream and there's no other way
to describe this lipstick besides orange
it's just a very bright in your face
Orange this one is so shot and it's a
matte lipstick this is my favorite
summer lipstick because it is a nice way
to wear red in the summer since it has
orange undertones
next is my baby and it is Ruby woo it is
a matte formula and this is my favorite
red lipstick of all time I just think
it's so wearable and it's the classic
red I love it so much
this next one is called fresh Moroccan
and it is a frost and it is very
noticeable Frost it has like some gold
shimmers and you could see it kind of in
the center of my lips this is my holiday
lipstick I love wearing it on
Thanksgiving on Christmas it's a
beautiful beautiful fall lipstick color
this one is deeply adored it a matte
formula this came out with the Marilyn
Monroe collection as you can see I love
this lipstick because it's not a flat
out red there's like a hint of cranberry
in there somewhere I don't know I think
it's really unique
this next one is called diva and it is a
matte formula and it is your typical
vampy red it's just a very very dark red
and believe it or not a lot of different
skin tones can really pull this lipstick
off
and finally my last lipstick is called
darkside it is an amplified formula and
it is very similar to Deva but it's a
little bit more purple Deva is a little
bit more red and this one is a little
more burgundy purple
so that is it my lips are about to fall
off right now
I literally have no lipstick on and it
looks like I do my lips are killing me
they are burning so I hope you enjoyed
this video and I hope the lip swatches
were a big help I hope they were my lips
have gone through a lot and maybe this
video helped you in some way maybe if
you were looking to buy a new mac
lipstick
maybe this helped so thank you so much

see you in my next video
