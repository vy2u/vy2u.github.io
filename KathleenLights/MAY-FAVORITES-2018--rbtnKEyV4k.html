my may favorites these are other
products I was loving in the month of
May first of all first of all long time
no see I haven't posted a video on
YouTube in a million years I am
currently out of town when you are
watching this so I am filming this a
week early but this is the video I'm
gonna come back with so hello I'm back
I'm so excited to be back thank you guys
for letting me take my break I love you
so much and I can't wait to be back and
better than ever
well I don't know if I'm gonna be better
than ever I probably will probably gonna
be exactly the same but I'm really
excited to be posting regularly again
I'm sorry that April and May were just
insane and actually for that reason I
don't have a ton of new stuff to talk
about I was pretty much using the same
things I was loving last month but I do
have a few new favorites I have really
really been loving so before this video
turns into a super long one let's just
get started by the way I didn't even try
with my hair today as you can probably
already tell my mom was watching this
like so I do quickly want to give a
shout out to Cal College because we do
have a brand new hand cream that we
recently launched and I am wearing my
dong sauce on my nails right now this
color will be coming out for summer this
is part of the summer Havana heat
collection which launches June 5th so I
just wanted to give a quick shout out
just in case you didn't know about our
new hand cream it's almond scented it's
free of a bunch of crap I love this guy
and I just wanted to mention it because
I have been using it for months and
months and months and months but now can
I actually talk about it so definitely
loving that I've also really been loving
the Kat Von D brow products surprisingly
because when I first tried them I didn't
I wasn't blown away by them especially
this product this is the Kat Von D brow
struck dimension powder and I have the
shade medium brown at first when I
opened this I was like um this shimmer
in this I don't want to push shimmer on
my eyebrows and I know a lot of brow
products have shimmer in them but this
has like a lot of shimmer like this is
like a shimmery eyeshadow but when you
apply it to the brows it really does
just give your brows so much dimension I
see why they named it that it's a really
nice brow powder
I love brow powders I always use them
I've been using the balms brow power for
years litter
like for the last four years that has
been my go-to brow powder but recently
I've been using this one and I really
really like it I like the color as well
like I like the tone and then this is
the signature brow precision pencil at
first the formula threw me off because
this is a pretty rough formula like you
really have to press hard to draw the
lines but once I got used to it I really
did like it I like the color I like how
long this stays in my brows I find that
my brows do last a little bit longer
with this and I find that I just get a
really good brow when I use those
products like in combination I mean
hands down my nude sticks gel what I
spoke about in my last month's favorites
that's the best eyebrow gel I've ever
used ever ever the new sixth one that
comes with the actual brow pencil I wish
nute sticks if you're watching my video
I doubt it but if you're watching my
video please please release your brow
gel in a single like just sell your brow
gel on its own I will buy 75 of them but
anyway I know brow pencils eyebrow
pencils everybody makes them but I
really have been liking this one and I
also like the shape of it the shape is
unique it's not super thin like a
traditional eyebrow pencil it kind of
has like a tiny little oval shape to it
and I love it okay so I have been
obsessed with trying out a bunch of
blushes in Maine I don't know what took
over my body but I put down my toasted
cinnamon for a little bit and I've been
trying out some different blushes and I
have three to talk about today and
they're all peach they're all some sort
of shimmery peach that is what I'm into
right now I want like intense peachy
Coralie shimmery cheeks right now for
some freaking crazy reason because like
I never wear blush but I want blush all
the time now I don't know but when in a
wild released like a huge okay what is a
huge she was like a normal collection of
birds it was like a hummingbird
collection or a fairy fairy bird I
forget the name but this is one of their
baked blushes and this in the shan
hummingbird hype this is limited edition
this is such a pretty blush topper i
love it
on top of blush like just a little bit
of this like for example if you put on a
matte blush and you want your cheeks to
have a nice like peachy shiny glow just
a little
this on a fluffy brush does sit on top
of the cheeks is beautiful I love it and
even though this has shimmer in it I
don't find it to be chunky or glittery
it just looks really flattering on the
cheeks and so pretty so perfect for
spring and summer like it is gorgeous
also I noticed that I always kind of
have like a mixture in my favourites
videos with high n and drugstore and I
feel like in May I wasn't trying out
that many drugstore products and I
definitely need to get back to my
drugstore game in June anyway another
blush I have been so loving so so loving
this actually the collab with Mac and
Patrick Starr this is the powder blush
duo in the shade I'm not blushing
this is so beautiful oh my god this is
great
I love this because it has a matte like
brownish type of blush that looks so
pretty and it kind of gives me a nice
tan I love this but it looks even better
when I mix them together when I'm really
fair I don't really like using this
completely on its own as a blush I like
mixing it with my bronzer and that looks
really good but I prefer mixing these
two colors together and it just looks so
stunning on the cheeks you look glowy
and beautiful but the nude really makes
it more wearable and just so delicious
and I have been loving this it lasts
forever on my cheeks it has a beautiful
Sheen it's less shimmery than this this
one is definitely more glowy and a
little bit more out there this is
definitely more toned down and more nude
but still peachy and glowy and beautiful
another product that's extremely similar
to the two products I was just talking
about this is the blush trio from morphe
and this is in the shade a pop of coral
elevates I love these so much this is
the blush I have on my cheeks right now
actually my favorite way to use this is
with my ELF stipple brush the little
travel one this has become like my
favorite blush brush I cannot get enough
of this brush but basically today I just
grabbed my brush I'm gonna like this and
popped it on my cheeks and I love it I
love this I usually don't like such
Coralie blushes but I have been really
really liking this look I just think
it's so like sexy for summer I love it
and I love that you get three different
blushes in this trio you get two matte
ones one is more peachy one is more nude
and then you get this really pretty
shimmery coral shade this reminds me a
lot of NARS orgasm but mixed all
together it creates the prettiest
deliciousness on the cheeks I really
really like these the quality is really
nice and the packaging is like very very
sturdy so I have been loving cob lash
apparently Carlin peach coral and peach
okay so I want to mention this product
because I have completely fallen in love
with this this is not brand new or
anything but Jacqueline Hale spoke about
this months and months and months ago
this is the makeup forever
star lip powder in number 13 she talked
about how it was like her favorite
highlight it was ultra beaming it was
great and I used it a couple times but I
didn't really like think anything of it
until I took it to Vegas at the
beginning of the month and we were all
gonna go out to like the club one night
and I was putting this on my cheeks I
had put on the Omri Zee highlighter
underneath but then I felt like I needed
something more so I added this on top
and when I walked into the kitchen and
media was like umm what is on your
cheeks because they look like soaking
wet I love getting compliments like that
like if someone tells you your highlight
looks great it's like so I got really
excited and now I haven't even put it
down since I media told me that it's the
highlight I'm wearing right now it's the
only highlight on my face right now and
I love it it's beaming it's so
reflective and intense but I love that
the powder is ultra fine so it's not
glittery and it's not like a typical
loose highlighter it's very very very
fine
and so ultra metallic this really does
look like pearl on your skin it makes
your cheeks look wet and I don't know
why all of a sudden I can't get enough
but I can't this is awesome on the inner
corners under the brow bone on the face
it's just so beautiful as eyeshadow too
it's amazing I highly recommend you
check this little sucker out it is worth
the money and then another highlight i
want to mention actually comes from this
dream palette from Anastasia I'm shocked
I like this like I said this is the
dream glow kit it's their newest glow
kit and it comes with six colors and I
wasn't gonna like this mainly because of
these colors like as you can see they're
pretty colorful I am so over these
colorful highlights but these are my cup
of tea there's something so wearable
about them and so unique that I freaking
love them so my favorite is wish you
could probably tell it's like the most
natural-looking but when you swatch
these like I said I really thought I
wasn't gonna like them because and I
only are they kind of colorful but
they're very glittery like they have a
sparkle to them that I can't really
describe but they're not chunky they
look so metallic and glowy on the skin
it really is a beautiful high light
formula and the best thing about this is
that those pigments like those colorful
shimmery glitters you don't really see
it unless you hit the light at a certain
angle like these almost have a slight
dual chrome to them I was so impressed
by these I've used them a couple of
times
and I really really like them sunshine
and wish are the ones that I've used the
most of I'm gonna be honest I never
really played around with the colorful
ones but even the colorful ones are
interesting to me I love this I wanted
to give it a huge shout out because at
first I didn't think I was gonna like it
and I was polysemy sympathize I have to
give a shout out to the al-ahmad palette
from a lot of cosmetics this is I'm
sorry this is the Train and I've got it
pally
nothing about palette but this is volume
one expect to see more stuff from a
LeMat on the future gabby has been
working on some stuff and what's coming
is good this is such an amazing
eyeshadow palette such a beautiful
tropical palette that has the best
pigmentation ever like you will not get
better shimmers than this guys these are
the ultimate metallic shimmers but
they're amazing
my favorite hands-down is a monocle it's
so ultra metallic like oh my gosh
this palette is so incredible I'm
wearing Gokul taxi in my crease right
now and then I have got four seats on my
outer corners and on my lower lashline I
love this because you can get funky
looks but also wearable looks as well
and it's just really great and if you
want to support a Cuban woman on the
hustle doing it all on her own this is a
Latina own brand
it is amazing cannot wait to see what
Gaby comes up with next oh I want to
show you the brushes because I didn't
have my brushes when I did my makeup
tutorial I did a film another makeup
tutorial where I used celeea and it's a
very like tropical look and that video
should be coming up next but expect to
see another tutorial using this palette
but I wanted to show you her brushes
because I find them to be so unique I
love this green handle I love this
copper like ferrule thing is that what
this is called I love the vibe of these
brushes and they're very very very soft
as well I use this one on my inner
corners this to puff up the crease and
this has become my new favorite eyebrow
brush I love little flat square brushes
like this for my eyebrows and my royal
and langnickel brush broke so I had to
get another one and turns out I freaking
love this one it's my new favorite brow
brush so I love these I love my brushes
as well you can get them on the website
I love my cosmetics calm definitely
check it out
but speaking of eyeshadows I have fall
in love I have fall in love these are so
unique these are such an amazing formula
you need these we need all of them pick
the Bible because they're all good these
are the dose of colors block party
eyeshadows you know what's weird you
know what's weird not to not to sound
like but I always told myself if I ever
came out with a makeup company that I
would create things like this I have
been dying for a company to come out
with an eyeshadow like this like I've
been waiting for this lunch from end
from anyone I've been wait great at his
work one these are very strong but
anyway when I was saying was I've been
waiting for a brand to come out with
something like this these are cream
eyeshadows that have a ton of glitter in
them so they're just like glitter bombs
creamy glitter bombs and they're amazing
the formula is really nice they're very
shimmery and glittery they pack a punch
you just have to build them up like if
you want more shimmer and more color
payoff you do have to apply like two to
three layers for example my favorite
favorite one what I've used the most is
encore it's this one right here it's
like a reddish brown and you really have
to
like three times in order for it to look
like this but it's so beautiful and like
the golden like sparkle on your eyes is
unreal I love encore if you're gonna get
one get encore I mean if you like warm
Browns and if you're into like golden
glitters this is so pretty
I'm actually wearing this one on my eyes
right now it's called shall we dance and
it's such a pretty like pinky champagne
shimmer they have colorful ones they
have the deep smoky shades greens oh my
gosh I haven't been super excited about
a launch in a while and I was so excited
for these to launch and they definitely
exceeded my expectations they are so
good all right so I only have two more
products to share with you guys you need
this in your life if you are a dry girl
if you like your makeup to look really
dewy you 100% need this in your life
this is the cover effects dewy finish
setting spray first of all this has the
best mist
ever look at this perfect I'm gonna show
you guys drinking you can go overboard
with this as you guys saw in a recent
video I did but if you want to look dewy
this is the setting spray for you you
are going to look dewy my friend this
has become my favorite setting spray
when I want my skin to look wet and dewy
I mean my morphe setting spray it will
always be my favorite but this one makes
you look like glossy and beautiful
without being greasy and oily like the
tatcha luminous dewy skin spray oh my
gosh yes if you have oily skin and
you've been wanting that tatcha luminous
spray but you're scared is gonna make
you too oily but you still want the glow
definitely pick up this one because I
feel like this is just as good without
taking it too far
this is amazing hands down way better
than their high performance setting
spray that's brand new by the way I like
this way way more even the nozzle like
the mist is better than this one that is
good stuff
favorite is actually a lipgloss an
orange lip gloss I love this color I
mainly have been wearing it because of
the color but the formula is nice too
this is the wet and wild lip gloss in
pout of paradise it reminds me of mum Oh
from Miami fever but like in a gloss
version my favorite paired with this is
it's literally the same but like glossy
it's so pretty I love this burnt orange
terracotta vibe especially in the summer
I love this color it just looks so
pretty on so many nudes it like makes it
so orange but I love orange it's one of
my favorite colors especially in makeup
and I have just been really really
enjoying this glass it's really good
