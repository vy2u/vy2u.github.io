that crazy foundation video that keeps
going around where everyone is mixing
all of their foundations I'm doing that
for you guys today not only has it been
really requested but I really wanted to
do this I don't do videos like this that
often like the ones that are all over
the internet like a hundred layers of
foundation you know like that crazy work
that was going around but every time I
see this video pop up on my subscription
feed I'm like I really want to do that
there's something about mixing all of my
foundations together that gets me really
excited I'm gonna link Sophie and my
guard down below I believe she's the one
who created this video I believe she's
the first one to do it please correct me
in the comments if I'm wrong but I'm
gonna link her channel her video down
below definitely check her out I feel
like she started like a crazy trend I
have been seeing this video everywhere
so I'm so sorry if you're like oh my
gosh another one of these videos I'm
over it
I'm not so I've seen a lot of people do
this video with like 100 foundations and
even though I am a beauty influencer or
whatever you want to call us over here I
don't have as many foundations as well
okay I have over thirty foundations and
I know that that is crazy that's a lot
but I feel like there are other people
on YouTube who have a lot more so I
think that's pretty good
okay so anyway I'm just gonna go ahead
and get started there's actually like
two foundations in here I've never even
used before like I just got this flower
beauty foundation never use this before
also I just got this Dior Forever
undercover 24-hour foundation that I've
also never used before so I'm really
excited to see how all of these mixed
together and how they perform on the
face like how they wear on the face it
is like 3 p.m. so it's probably gonna be
a really crappy you wear test I should
have filmed this video this video
earlier but I am gonna come back at the
end of the day and show you guys what
the foundation looks like even though
it's not gonna be that many hours I'll
probably show you guys after like 5
hours more or less but anyway I'm gonna
go ahead and grab a bolt from my kitchen
let's get to mixing
all right so all the foundations are
nicely mixed in this bowl I'm not gonna
lie I'm a little bit concerning because
a few of these foundations squirted out
a little bit oily especially the milk
makeup one a little bit of a oily
situation there most of my foundations
are a bit Dhulia and more luminous I
don't really go for that matte look but
I do have a few matte foundations in
here like the Catrice one the Fenty
Beauty one there are a few matte ones
and a lot of them in this ones but I'm
really really intrigued to see how this
looks on the face I don't know if this
is my color I think I am a little bit
too fair for this right now but anyway
let's go ahead and see how this looks on
the face I'm gonna apply half of it
using my love is the foundation brush
from Pitt cosmetics it's my favorite
brush to apply foundation and then on
this side I'm gonna use a Beauty Blender
there's so much foundation and this I
know this video is like so wasteful
you're wasting so much product but it
looked interesting so I really wanted to
do it
oh this color isn't so bad I feel like
this matches me perfectly actually oh
that's a lot of coverage I would say
most of my foundations are full coverage
but I do have quite a few that are sheer
coverage like for example my makeup
forever face and body this is like
barely any coverage but it's like my
favorite foundation of all time and then
they had to go and replace it with this
we're just nowhere near as good but
anyway I'm over it it's been a while so
I'm already I feel like this is
oxidizing a little bit
oh I bled too much yeah you see it is
kind of oxidizing or not oxidizing it's
just getting like a little bit deeper as
I blend it I feel like that is your way
Foundation alone will give me like a
mask of coverage that thing is so full
coverage but I really like this finish
so far this is looking really pretty so
I feel won't let me put the other side
even sounds crazy
I feel like I got played way too much
with this Beautyblender I got picked up
way way too much foundation use the
other side to pick up some excess
product
I'm like going on this side with my
beauty blender ah I feel like both sides
give me the same amount of coverage the
only thing I noticed is that obviously
the beauty blender side looks a little
bit more luminous than this side but
that's obviously because it's it's a
Beauty Blender and the water in the
Beauty Blender always just makes your
foundation look a little bit more
luminous and it usually sheers out the
foundation but I feel like I have the
same amount of coverage on both sides
I'm just gonna go over everything with
my sponge well I actually really really
like how this is making my skin look
it's giving me really really full
coverage but I like it so far I have to
see if it settles into my line though I
already see it getting Creasy right
there I already see it but that's just
my face there's nothing I could do about
it okay all right so I have applied all
the foundation to my face this is all
that's left over a part of me really
wants to just scoop some of this out and
put it in a little jar but then the
other part of me is like girl you are
not gonna use that ever again I know
what super wasteful but at the same time
most of my foundations are gonna go bad
before I finish them anyway so might as
well get a video out of it okay so I'm
gonna zoom you guys in so you can see my
face so the coverage is really awesome
it's like really really a full coverage
which doesn't surprise me there's so
many foundations in there but when I
touch my face it does feel a little bit
tacky but I'm sure when I said that that
feeling will go away I don't love how it
looks around my nose that is definitely
my trouble area right here well my
problem area it's right in between here
and around my nose foundation tends to
sit there because I have a really dry
skin in that area so it does look a
little bit cakey around my nose but
nothing like too crazy and it doesn't
look terrible in between my brows either
I'm not hating it I thought I was gonna
hate it but I'm not hating it what are
you guys think I really like this glow
that it gave my face I don't know I
think I might really like this not that
I would ever do this again but I thought
I was gonna hate that combo because I
have very dry sensitive skin and I
attend to go for more lightweight
foundations even if I have a very full
coverage foundation I tend to sheer it
out a bit I don't like that super
look and even though like this feels
heavy it it doesn't really look heavy
not that feels heavy but I just have a
lot of foundation on so I'm gonna go
ahead and finish up the rest of my face
makeup and I won't be right back okay so
I put on the rest of my face makeup and
I noticed something while I was doing my
makeup I didn't put on any primer did
you guys catch that yeah I completely
forgot to put on primer which is crazy
because I do not put on foundation ever
without any primer but at least I had a
little bit of moisturizer on from a
couple hours ago when I wash my face
that totally sucks I can't believe I
forgot that but I'm noticing that like
my lines are there like they're totally
there 100% but by now they would be a
little bit more pronounced which is
weird I mean I justified it like an hour
ago so maybe the lines haven't come in
yet but I'm gonna impress by that I will
say I do think the foundations got a
little bit darker as I was doing my
makeup I noticed like a significant
difference between my face and my neck
but once I applied concealer and all of
that I mean I think it looks pretty good
and I mean so far I do like how it looks
you can just tell I'm wearing foundation
like there's a lot on my face and I
don't know if that's just because I had
so much in the bowl I was picking up a
lot of product but it does look
foundation II a little bit oh yeah and I
wanted to tell you guys that I didn't
use any of my stick foundations in this
video because I didn't want to like
scrape a layer off of my six month I
thought that was I thought that would be
weird so I didn't include any of my
stick foundations and if any of you guys
were wondering
that is why but yeah I think that's it
this was pretty cool this was pretty fun
I was really intrigued to see how it was
gonna turn out and not so bad I'm gonna
update you guys at the end of the night
see how this war may be it's like an
ultra long wearing foundation or maybe
it breaks up after a couple of hours we
will see I will see you guys at the end
of the night hello guys I'm back okay so
my foundation is Ben I'm gonna face all
my foundations I've been on my face for
about like five hours now and I just
I need to take it off I just need to
take it off already so I'm just here to
update you guys you know what it's not
that bad considering how much I applied
on my face like when I first stamped my
Beauty Blender onto my face I knew right
away like I applied a lot of foundation
so obviously because of that reason that
my face just looks pretty cakey the
foundation did settle into my smile
lines but you know what not as bad as I
thought they were gonna settle because
I'm just I'm wearing a mask here folks
so it really isn't that bad the main
area of my face that looks bad is the
situation around my nose so I really
isn't terrible and I mean for five hours
this is not so bad in my contours on and
it still looks pretty good it just looks
heavy on the skin if I had the chance to
use this foundation again like if they
bottled this foundation up in a bottle
and it was one foundation I would use it
again but I would apply a lot less to my
face because all the foundations I used
I pretty much love I'm not really one to
hold on to foundation I don't like so I
really don't have any foundations I hate
it but it was cool to see all of them
come together in a little mold so that I
could apply them to my face but yeah
guys I mean that completes this video it
was it was pretty fun I don't recommend
you do this at home but it was cool to
see and yeah guys that completes this
video thank you so much for watching
please subscribe if you haven't already
and I will see you in my next video bye
