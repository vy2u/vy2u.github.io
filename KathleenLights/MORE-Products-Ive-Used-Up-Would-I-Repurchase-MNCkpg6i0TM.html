an empty video I keep this bag in my
bathroom this is like an old Sephora bag
every time I finish up a beauty product
if I remember I usually throw it in this
bag sometimes I forget and throw it in
the garbage but I have been trying to
keep up with it and I've been trying to
be really good and I've been throwing
them in here and for the most part and
now we're going to go through everything
and we're going to discuss them I'm
going to let you know if I would
repurchase them again I'm gonna let you
know what was good what was not so good
what was amazing you know you know you
know how these empties videos work but
if you don't that's basically it so Liz
you'll be I went to do some makeup wipes
like I usually do I am addicted to
makeup wipes and even though I wash my
face every night before bed I always
like to remove my makeup before I wash
my face where that be with a cleanse off
oil or with a wife but I go through the
websites going out of style I've gone
through maybe like a hundred of these
already
these are they simple my seller makeup
remover wipes I used to use the original
simple wipes but when they release me my
seller ones I found these to be way
better
they don't strip the skin they don't
leave a film on the skin and they take
off all your makeup in the most gentle
way possible it really does feel like
you're taking off your makeup with
micellar water these are amazing I love
them so much I've talked about them a
trillion times and you can get them at
the drugstore they're awesome I also
want to do some more of these Co Shindo
cleansing spa waters these are my
favorite high-end makeup boy I know
their privacy justice parameter for a
makeup life I know but they're really
saturated with this water and I find it
removes my makeup so fast like the
towelettes are really wet but they're
not wet in the gross way kind of like I
know I offend anybody but the Neutrogena
wipes I can't use them I can't I can't
okay
they're wet and almost like a sticky way
and they kind of leave a film on my skin
I don't like them these don't do that
they remove everything and they're just
they're just amazing
they're amazing I also want to do some
elf fragrance free cleansing cloths I
love how they released fragrance free
wipes these even have aloe which I
really love aloe vera is like one of my
favorite things to put on my skin so I
really enjoyed these I don't think
they're as good as the simple ones but I
did really like them to remove swatches
or stuff
that and I want most likely repurchase
these for sure the next time I pick
something up from the elf website I like
this and then another makeup remover
wipes saying you've seen a hundred times
on my channel I'm a creature of habit
and I find things I like those are the
things I use these are the Murad
clarifying wipes for blemish prone skin
in my opinion I feel like people either
love these or hate these for example my
sister absolutely hates me she used this
at my house once and she said it was
like burning her skin I personally don't
feel that when I use these and I have
really sensitive skin I don't know what
the deal was with that but these are
clinically proven to keep skin clear by
removing dirt bacteria and pore clogging
oils I even find that these work for my
dry skin and I know that people with
oily skin prefer this because it has
witch hazel which controls oil but I
find that these cleanse my skin better
than any wipes on the market like even
more than my co Shindo these make my
skin feel literally clean as opposed to
those wipes that just like remove my
makeup my skin feels so clean when I use
this to kind of like that minty feeling
so when you're like wiping off your
makeup your face like feels cool don't
use these on your eyes though they might
sting a little bit and I freaking love
them I think I do and I by trillions at
a time I love those like okay enough of
that you've seen me some of those in the
meantime let's talk about body wash I
have gone through so many of these bags
and I always forget to put them in here
and I always throw them away because me
and Danny both use them these are
refilled bags of the L'Occitane almond
shower oil I mean it has like a long
name lube did to me Gemma I can't read
that this has the best body wash I've
ever used in my entire life and it's a
strange one I feel like it's one that
takes some getting used to because when
you initially pump it out in the shower
it comes out like an oil and then as you
start to lather it in your hands and
really rub it on your body it's first to
get a little bit soapy not like dry
soapy and sudsy it just lathers up a
little bit and it just turns into like a
really creamy delicious soapy non-drying
body wash it's fantastic and then when
you wash it all off your skin just feels
like a million dollars I love this so
much I bought a little sample the first
time I use it and then I fell so in love
with it that I bought the big tub and
then I just go on the L'Occitane website
and I buy the refills because if you get
them in these
and you just refill your little tub it
turns out to be so much cheaper because
Danny and I go through these so fast and
girl that's a census but in this case I
really do think these are worth it watch
I'll even show you how much Danny loved
it let me call them tell everybody how
you feel about the almond shower oil my
shower gel a long time has put me on to
greatness so you think it's definitely
worth the high price I think it's
definitely worth everything for what it
is it's amazing okay thank you bye see
even a man agrees and men will wash
their bodies with pretty much anything
okay so I've gone through countless
bottles of this I even spoke about this
in my last empty so I don't want to go
on and on about this I always lose the
cap this is the Elizabeth and James
Nirvana blacks dry shampoo this is my
favorite dry shampoo hands-down you guys
know this and this is another really
pricey product I get - Sephora but to me
it's so worth it I feel like this is the
only dry shampoo that really sucks up
all my oil and makes my hair look
freshly washed I'm not someone who loves
dry shampoos just for volume and
thickness
I just want my hair to feel clean I just
want my hair to look less greasy and I
feel like this is the best product for
that and it even smells like the Nirvana
black perfume which leaves my hair
smelling like those are vana black
perfume and it's amazing I truly truly
love this I will continue to repurchase
this over and over again I have two
sitting in my drawer right now if you
are on a budget and you're looking for
an amazing dry shampoo batiste makes my
favorite dry shampoo from the drugstore
I usually get mine at Ulta so yeah
definitely check that one out if you
don't want to spend so much on that one
let's talk about a couple of makeup
items I've gone through two mascaras I
have gone through way more than this but
these are the only two I found in there
so this is the it cosmetics superhero
mascara this one is really really good
but in my opinion I find that it goes to
shiz a lot faster than some of my other
mascaras like this becomes really thick
and really clumpy really fast but with
that being said I think the first couple
of months
this is so good it makes your lashes
really really thick and really really
volumizing it doesn't give you much
links but it does give your lashes some
drama so if you're looking for that this
is a good one and then this is the
Elizabeth Mott it's so big volumizing
mascara
anybody remember me talking about this a
few years ago if you do you totally have
been here for a while and so thank you
for that I love you I love the rest of
you too by the way I love ya I used to
love this mascara so much I think I got
it in a nifty bag for the first time and
then I became addicted and I started
purchasing them off of the Elizabeth
Mott website it's one of those tubing
mascaras where you just like put warm
water on your lashes and then you just
like pull it and they come off in little
tubes but not all of them are really
really good there are only a few that
I've tried that I actually really liked
and this happens to be one of them I
still think if you're looking for a
tubing mascara and you don't mind
spending a pretty penny on it be trish
mcevoy high volume mascara and jet black
is my favorite tubing mascara of all
time after discovering this one I
probably won't repurchase this just
because I like this one a lot more but
before this this was my favorite tubing
mascara it's really easy to remove
really easy to apply and it doesn't
smudge or flake anywhere I mean it is a
really really good mascara talk about a
body wash I've seen everyone talk about
recently this is the sole version a toe
resilient 4-play moisturizing shower
cream gel I bought this along with the
body mists they recently came out with
and I also tried out the bum bum cream
that everybody's been raving about and I
really did like this I mean I used it up
I liked it I just don't love it as much
as my L'Occitane one I'm not going to
lie I I can't I can't seem to fall in
love with anything the way I love that
one this did feel really moisturizing on
my skin and it really did do the job
this is in the scent pistachio caramel
and while I loved it at first I feel
like it might be a little too strong for
me the scent is a little bit too sweet
in my opinion and I know that's an
extremely unpopular opinion nobody kill
me it's just oh it with a hair too
strong for me or not too strong but like
a hair too sweet for me and I'm usually
a sweet scent lover this one just just
sort of hair too far like a little bit
too far but regardless I did think it
was really really good
whatever you purchase it I don't think
so I don't think so because I
I have another body wash I like more but
I wouldn't like never repurchase it you
know kind of like I'm in-between I'm on
the fence I went through one of these
guys this is the Dior show brows Tyler
brow pencil in the shade Universal but I
just remembered I also went through and
Anastacio brow Wiz in dark brown and I
love both of these so much I love both
of them equally I think they're both
really good brow pencils but I like the
color of the Dior one better now that my
hair is a little bit lighter than when I
first got into the brow is dark brown is
a little bit too dark on my brows now
like it works for me I still use it
because I love dark brows no matter how
blonde your hair is like I love dark
brows but I find that the dark brown
color on me just looks like a hair too
harsh so I'm thinking of getting another
color but the brow Wiz is amazing
anastacio it just knows what she's doing
with brow products I love the brows and
I really really really love the broth
oiler from Dior and I have repurchased
both of them they are both really good
in terms of formulation they're both
circles pretty awesome this is the
brioche yours Arco repair shampoo it's
free of sulfates silicones and parabens
and I really really love this shampoo I
love this brand I have yet to come
across a product that I absolutely hate
from brailles you the Rose dark hole
leave-in milk is like my favorite
leave-in conditioner ever and I found
that the chef who really did moisturize
my hair while cleaning it at the same
time it didn't strip it nor did it leave
it oily it was really really good and I
love how it has really natural
ingredients it has rosehip oil argan oil
coconut oil yet it clings really well I
think if you have curly hair and your
hair is normally pretty dry you might
really like this shampoo because really
Rolla did two liquid eyeliners this is
the NYX matte liquid liner I actually
went through this a long long time ago
and I found it somewhere in my bathroom
it's very mad at very black and on me it
lasts a really long time I would say
it's really similar to the NYC liquid
liner that got discontinued why would
they discontinue or I'm not going to
just continue or they're just no longer
selling it in the states I think they're
just selling it like overseas I'm not
sure but this one is very very similar
to that and then this one
the girl lactic precise eyeliner marker
this one is really really good but I
prefer a brush tip or a felt tip and
this one was a felt tip so I probably
wouldn't go out and purchase this it's
good it I just have other line eyeliners
I like better okay a product that I
don't know if I love or hate this is the
first aid beauty cleansing body polish
with active charcoal it buffs away
impurities and it's safe for sensitive
skin I agree was asked my skin sensitive
and I didn't have any irritation with
this this is an exfoliator for your body
and this does an amazing job
I really really love the results I got
from this but the smell was too much I
know sometimes I get a little bit
dramatic when it comes to cents but I
just really want things to smell good I
really do and this I mean this smells
like charcoal there's no other way to
describe it it's made with freaking
charcoal so obviously it's going to
smell like charcoal but it's a strong
scent and I personally did not enjoy
that and I felt like while I was in the
shower and I was really scrubbing my
body I was just like dying to finish so
that I could wash my skin with my body
wash just so that I could smell
something else but it does get the job
done I mean it does what it's supposed
to do so I can't be mad at you I can't I
don't hate you I just I just like to
smell you so I will most likely not now
buy this I actually went through an
entire lip balm I have so many lip balms
that I find them hard to get through I
have one in my booty room under my
pillow in my purse under my rug in the
laundry room in the bathroom I have them
everywhere because if I feel like my
lips are chapped
I need something right away so wherever
I am I need to have a lip balm nearby
but I actually went through an entire
one and this is the fresh sugar lip
treatment though writing is completely
rubbed off because I mean I just I used
it all completely so it's like you know
we know it's like done you know gone no
more fini took this lip balm is truly
truly awesome but it's like twenty
dollars do I think it's worth the price
no even though I went through it I don't
think it's worth the money
maybe it's so good okay it's really
really good but there are other lip
balms like aqua for that you can get at
Walgreens for like $3
and they work just as good as this fresh
one so even though this is amazing I
don't think it's worth the money I have
a ton of these though that they've sent
me over time and I love them so I will
continue to use those but if I ran out
with all of them I probably wouldn't I
probably wouldn't purchase it now that
I've discovered aquaphor and I use that
all the time like I probably wouldn't go
out and repurchase this even though I
have purchased quite a few myself so I
love this so much it's amazing and it
smells like lemons and it's delicious
really good stuff I want to do a little
keel midnight recovery I this is like
the second tube I've gone through this
is my favorite eye cream hands-down I
have been using one from youth to the
people I think that's the brand that I
really really love it that one is really
moisturizing and I use it all the time
but I still use this one in conjunction
and I have already repurchased it this
is amazing for your dark circles if
you're someone who suffers from dark
circles I think you should give this a
try you might not see results right away
but after a few weeks I saw result it
was crazy so I highly highly recommend
it and then last but certainly not least
is this guy right here this is the Jo
Malone blackberry and Bay Cologne that
is amazing I purchased this little
bottle from Nordstrom because these
perfumes are an arm and legs man jo
Malone is so dense and there's a lot of
expensive things in this empties and I
feel like it's because when I buy
something that's really really pricey I
feel like it is my mission to use it up
so that I get my money's worth but this
is definitely something that I think is
so worth the money this is such a
delicious perfume this fruity it's very
citrusy kind of like handsome at the
same time I will have the notes written
right here on the screen somewhere but
it just smells citrusy yet woodsy and
fresh yet sexy I don't know it is truly
amazing every time I wear this perfume I
get complimented literally every single
time someone's like what are you wearing
every time it never fails any time a
perfume does that to me I find it to be
so worth the money and it lasts a really
really long time on my skin which is
fabulous
we'll definitely be repurchasing that
for my purse very soon okay guys so back
