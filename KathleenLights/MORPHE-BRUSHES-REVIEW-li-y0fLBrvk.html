a review on the brand morphe brushes i
have gotten a lot of requests to do a
video like this i will be talking about
their eyeshadows and their brushes in
this video i think most people are
interested to know about their
eyeshadows but i will touch base on the
brushes just in case any of you were
wondering about the brushes as well now
if you don't know morphe brushes is a
brand that sells really really
affordable products they sell really
affordable brushes and really affordable
i shadow z' if you buy their eyeshadows
individually they're only two dollars a
pop $2 i shadow z' and that is
incredible that is that's a dirt cheap
and i actually first heard of morphe
brushes like a year and a half ago maybe
more no like two years ago
from that girl shake so that's the first
time that i had ever heard about them
she had done like a review on them and i
thought that they were such good quality
eyeshadows i had always wanted to pick
them up then i kind of forgot about them
and then recently I just really got into
them so I have a few brushes from the
brand and if you guys saw my favorite
drugstore slash affordable makeup
brushes you would have seen that I
included a couple of these brushes so I
do have a few but I'm gonna go over my
favorite ones not going to go into too
much detail because I did talk about
them in that video but I personally
think that they're blending brushes are
phenomenal I believe they're like under
$6 and they're incredible blending
brushes are to me the hardest brushes to
find at the drugstore I feel like you
can get a really good flat shader brush
from ELF and an angled brush and an
eyeliner brush those are easier brushes
to find at the drugstore but I feel like
the drugstore is lacking in like the
blending fluffy blending brush area do
you not I'm saying this is like my top
top favorite brush from the brand and it
is the M b23 it is the ideal fluffy
brush really really comparable to Sigma
e-40 the famous Sigma e-40 as you can
see
they are very similar this one is just a
little bit longer the hairs are just a
tiny bit longer and a little bit more
flimsy
but I like it like that because it
really just blows out and buffs the
eyeshadow in the crease I love it
I alternate between these two but
honestly for the price I wouldn't
repurchase this one I will continue to
get my morphe one by the way there's
like a bunch of controversy people say
that it is pronounced morphe and all
that stuff but it is actually pronounced
more feet I actually was on the phone
with customer service not too long ago
and he was like thank you for calling
morphe brushes love Allah
so it's Morrissey anyway the other
blending brushes I really really like as
well are the MB 13 the MB 25 and the m4
for one these are what they look like
right here the M B 13 it's a pretty good
dupe for the Mac 217 I still like the
Mac 217 one better but it's a pretty
decent dupe for it actually and keep in
mind that morphe brushes has a bunch of
different style brushes they have the MB
black line which is these right here
these are the brushes that I own but
they also have like the mineral brush
line the studio brush line the vegan
brush line the studio pro brush line the
gunmetal ones which look really really
beautiful and then they all range in
price depending on which brush line you
get and stuff like that the face brushes
will of course be more expensive so just
keep that in mind three brushes that I
really love that are face brushes first
one is this one this is the morphe S 19
I got this in my boxycharm and it's been
my go-to brush ever since I bought it I
use it for bronzer I use it for
everything I love this brush this is
their de luxe powder dome brush and it
is actually from their vegan line so
this is a vegan brush which is also
really great this brush is $20 which is
a little bit pricey but it is a face
brush based brushes are always more
expensive and the quality of this one
like the softness of this brush is to
die for
I love this I want to order a bunch of
vegan brushes from them because
it's really soft great quality and then
I really love their dual fiber brushes
this is just like a basic duo fiber
brush it's really good but I think that
their standout one is this one this is
the morphe m4 36 and this one is super
comparable to that Mac one that looks
just like this it's like that small duo
fiber brush a bunch of you guys own the
elf one and the elf one is cheaper but I
love this brush this is the best small
duo fiber brush I have ever used in my
life it's great for cream products it's
great for highlighting the cheekbones it
is just made so sturdy and like thick I
don't know how to explain it but like
when I'm using it I'm like wow this is
such a good quality brush and it is a
face brush but it is only $6.99 this is
in their duo fiber collection and their
duo fiber collection is actually pretty
cheap so enough with brushes I honestly
think out of all the brushes I've tried
they've all been really really good
so now I'm going to move on to eye
shadows and my thoughts on their eye
shadows I'm first going to talk about
this one really fast this is one of
their palettes that already comes built
so you can purchase this exact palette
exactly how it looks because they sell
it on their website kind of like Coastal
Scents and Sedona lace and all those
brands that have these large palettes
with a bunch of different colors in them
morphe brushes does the same thing they
have different ones with different
colors they have a color for one like
this they have a more neutral palette
with a bunch of neutral eyeshadows and
ones with more colorful smokey deep ones
they have a bunch they also have like
contour palettes foundation palettes you
know if you are familiar with Coastal
Scents and all those other brands it's
very similar to that the difference I
feel with morphe brushes is that their
eyes shadow are large I actually had a
Sedona lace palette there was like a
hundred different eyeshadows in it and
their eyeshadows were tiny tiny tiny
these eyeshadows are the exact same size
as Mac eyeshadows and this whole palette
retails for only $20 I believe that this
specific palette if I remember it's
called the 35 glam palette the 35 color
glam palette so there are 35 eyeshadows
in here so you're paying less than a
dollar for each eyeshadow which is a
better deal than Buy
them as individual eyeshadows but I will
say I recommend going for individual
eyeshadows when it comes to this brand I
recommend buying the individual
eyeshadows because I think that they are
better quality I mean do not get me
wrong these have pretty good
pigmentation actually really good
pigmentation I cannot complain I will
show you right now
the pigmentation is there as you can
obviously see but I do recommend using a
primer with this these are the type of
eyeshadows that look better swatch on
your fingers and on your hands even
though they swatch pretty darn good but
on your eyes they can get a little
powdery they can get a little bit chalky
I've noticed that with a few colors in
this palette I was actually using these
purples and these greens and I had to
like pack on the color a little bit more
and just try to blend a little bit
better because it kind of faded in
certain spots and it got a little bit
patchy so keep that in mind with this I
still think that palettes like these are
worth it because it's so cheap
especially when you want to try out
colors you get so many different colors
in one palette or if you're a really
really neutral girl they have those as
well these this palette actually has a
few neutral colors like right here you
get a white a beige a gold color really
really pretty colors that's what's
really nice I actually have this white
color as my brow bone highlight
I love stark white eye shadows because
they really lift your brow bone and it
went on super creamy this white color is
not patchy I have this beige one on my
entire lid and I have this super super
fluorescent yellow in my inner corners
right here and now it's a little weird
not for everybody but I thought it would
be a fun look so I do enjoy this palette
especially for the money but like I said
I definitely recommend buying the
individual eyeshadows because they are
better quality I don't know why I don't
know if they just put more money into
the single eyeshadows than they do into
this and they work harder on their
single eyeshadows maybe
but the single eyeshadows they give off
more color payoff
they just are buttery er they're a lot
smoother even though these are so great
don't get me wrong these are still great
but they're single eyeshadows I think
they're better quality that's just my
opinion I have this palette right here
to share with you guys
I bought this morphe palette on their
website and I believe this case was
about $6.99 and it holds 12 different
eyeshadows you can put your Mac
eyeshadows in this you can put your
makeup geek eyeshadows in this I decided
to buy this palette and not just stick
these in a Z palette because I wanted to
tell the difference between my
eyeshadows just because these looks so
similar to make a peak since they are at
the same size I wanted to make sure that
my makeup geek eyeshadows stayed in a Z
palette and that my morphe individual
eyeshadows stayed in a morphe palette
this is a great palette though it's
really sturdy has a giant mirror a
really nice mirror and it's really easy
to access these eyeshadows because of
the dip next to the eyeshadows and they
just pop right out
I will enter a clip of when I first got
this when I was putting my palette
together they come in tiny little
pouches the same way that makeup geek
eyeshadows come in if you're familiar
with those when you buy them as
individual eyeshadows I don't think you
can get these individual eyeshadows in
compact form I think they only come in
pan form but they do stick to z palettes
they're really easy to travel with so if
you have a Z palette and you order
morphe brushes you can just pop those
right into your Z palette so I actually
do really like this case it was
inexpensive and all I had to do was take
the eyeshadows out of the pouch and pop
them right in
now I quickly want to talk about these
eyeshadows I got each and every one of
the eyeshadows I got are super super
pigmented really really buttery I was
very impressed with the quality of these
eyeshadows considering they're only two
dollars I still recommend using a primer
underneath these because that's just
going to make them look a lot better my
absolute favorite ones that I got
because I only got 12 so that they could
fit in this palette is this one right
here this one is in the number 75 they
don't have names with them that is the
only thing that I don't really like is
that they don't have
names they are numbered kind of like
makeup forever eyeshadows so this one is
75 it is a beautiful beautiful copper
color and that's just right up my alley
very very buttery and smooth and on the
eyelids it just makes your eyes pop I
love this one I also really love this
deep maroon color right here this one is
in the shade 71 it's a nice deep kind of
like makeup geeks biddin eye shadow very
very similar actually and it's nice and
it's not very patchy it blends pretty
well I also love this green one right
here this one is the number 78 and it's
so beautiful because it has a little bit
of a gold undertone and it would look so
nice on so many different eye colors
especially brown I also really really
really love this one this one is 70 and
it is perfect for anybody who's into
those taupe shades it's such a pretty
color and it just blends on your eyelid
so so beautifully I highly recommend 70
and then just as a basic beautiful matte
crease shade this one is really nice is
called 61 and it's not super super light
so be careful with it if you are fair
but it's a nice crease color nonetheless
I will talk about a couple things that I
do not like ordering the individual
eyeshadows their pictures are kind of
funky I don't know how to explain it but
they kind of look like fake pictures
it's really hard to tell what I shadow
you are buying by the picture alone I
really wish it was more like makeup geek
you know how makeup geek has the picture
and it has a swatch like a live swatch
on her website so it's a lot easier to
know what you're picking because
honestly on the morphe website it'll
have a picture of the eyeshadow and you
really can't tell what the eyeshadow is
going to look like that much and then on
the bottom it'll just say like dark
brown matte you know so I mean it's kind
of helpful but not really for example
these two eyeshadows right here one is
61 and
the other one is 63 and on the website I
thought they were two completely
different eyeshadows and don't get me
wrong they are they are two completely
different eyeshadows but they're just so
so similar that I wish I would have seen
what they look like because I probably
wouldn't have bought both of them I
would have just bought one of them
because they are really similar so keep
that in mind when you are shopping on
the website try to google swatches of
the exact number eyeshadow you are
looking at to see if maybe someone has
swatches of them online because if not
you're gonna have to kind of wing it I
mean there are pictures don't get me
wrong but it's a little difficult
another really strange thing is that
when they have a lot of like backorder
or when the website is super super busy
sometimes you'll get a brush with no
number on it
it doesn't say morphe it doesn't say
anything which is a little strange even
though I could tell this feels like a
morphe brush and then I was on their
website and I was looking at their FAQ
section and one of the questions was why
did my product arrive without the
morphine logo and they says because of
high demand of popular items
occasionally morphe brushes expedites
manufacturing by not stamping the morphe
logo this is done to speed up our
product availability rest-assured
products without the morphe logo are the
exact same quality ingredients materials
and manufacturing as products with the
morphe logo so it's the exact same brush
only it doesn't say morphe on it so it's
kind of annoying if I'm using it for a
tutorial for some reason and someone's
like hey what brush is that I'm like I
don't know I mean that's not that
serious but I just wanted to tell you
that just in case you get one in the
mail and you're like hey mine doesn't
swing morphe ok so that really wraps up
this video I really don't have anything
else to say I think they're great brand
Oh their customer service is top-notch
um I actually ordered this and then it
was taking forever to ship and I didn't
know why so I called morphe brushes and
I was like do I place my order like five
days ago he's and he was really nice
about it he was like I'm so sorry I've
been really backed up because and this
is what he says because somebody famous
posted a video about our eyeshadows on
YouTube
we it was crazy and I was like ding ding
ding jacqueline freakin hill and i knew
exactly that it was jacqueline hill who
he was talking about because a couple
days after she posted that video or
she's posted a video on this brand i
went on the website and half of the
eyeshadows were sold out and they
probably still are sold out because the
colors that i really really wanted a lot
of them were sold out and i just thought
that was kind of funny but their
customer service is actually really
really great so yeah that is my thought
on the brand thank you guys so much for
watching please subscribe if you haven't
already and i will see you in my next
video bye
to beat somebody up on YouTube I'm
Angelo's um YouTube channel and somebody
said she was old news and they do not
really have pictures and they don't have
pictures what am I trying
to know about there but there I poke
Accession don't birth like this wracking
this business going up so much I'm in
control in lovin it rumors got me
laughing kid haha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
