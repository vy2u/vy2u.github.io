my yearly favourites I am so excited to
film this video I do this every year
basically I'm just gonna be sharing with
you my favorite makeup products from
2017 I cannot believe the year is over
I'm actually filming this on December
31st right now but I've been feeling so
crappy in this past week I've had a lot
of stomach issues I mean I've had
stomach issues my whole life I don't
want to get into it but I haven't been
able to sit down and film this video but
I had the chance to today and I'm so
excited because I get to talk about all
my most used products of the year so
it's not necessarily products that
launched in 2017 some of these are old
but they're still products that I mean I
just couldn't stop using this year and I
was looking at my last year's favorites
video and there are actually a few
products that I am mentioning again this
year so they're like favorites two years
in a row which is crazy I wasn't gonna
talk about favorites I spoke about last
year but I mean it is what it is some of
those products I'm still loving one year
later so that says a lot about these
products if there are two year winners
you know but anyway I don't want to
ramble on too much and oh by the way I'm
sitting on my floor last year I filmed
this video sitting on my floor because I
really wanted to put all the products
like laid out in front of me so that's
what we're doing again this year I'm
sitting on my floor let's get started
I'm gonna try to breeze through these
products as quickly as I can alright so
for primer there were two primers that
really stood out to me this year and one
of them is definitely my Becca first
light priming filter this is really one
of my favorite primers of all time every
time I wear this I'm like oh my skin
looks so good I love that it has like
this lilac tone I don't know if that
really does anything but I do feel like
it kind of brightens up my skin tone and
every time I apply this primer my face
just looks so glowy in the most healthy
way not like in a metallic insanely like
highlighted way it just looks so fresh
and natural and it's very hydrating as
well it's not one of those dewy primers
that does nothing for dry skin I'm
pretty sure this is my second bottle of
this and I'm already buy here so oh I do
want to mention I'm not gonna be talking
about my collabs in this video I
mentioned this last year as well and
I'll talk more about this at the end of
the video but obviously the products I
created and the products I worked on in
2017 are my favorites and my most used
but I really didn't want to
to sum those products because you guys
know like you already know they're my
favorites and those are definitely the
highlights of 2017 for me Michael abs
and my creations and kale polish like
that this is a major beauty favorite in
2017 like kale polish the only nail
polish I use now Oh which by the way
side note we just launched black and
white polishes on kale polish calm we
now have a super super white and a super
super black I'm actually wearing the
black color on my nails right now it's
called tuxedo mask and the white is
called papers no paper snow a ghost
anyway what I'm saying is the products I
personally worked on of course there are
my favorite but I am just talking about
other makeup products in today's video
okay because then this video would be
like extremely long but yes anyway let's
move on the other primer I just have to
talk about is the Smashbox photo finish
primer Iser this is a primer and
moisturizer in one it has a hyaluronic
acid it's amazing if you have extremely
dry skin and you're not looking for a
primer that's gonna give you a sheen
it's not gonna give you a highlight it's
just simply gonna hydrate the skin I
highly recommend this one makes my skin
so soft it doesn't look dry at all and
any foundation I put on top just looks
absolutely beautiful because there are
no dry patches no flakiness I love this
primer I'm a crazy person and I have for
foundation as I talked about last year
the winner was the hourglass foundation
stick and I still love that one so much
I use it in a lot of Keio polish
photoshoots but this year I've just been
using so many other foundations and I
have to mention I just have to mention a
few first off they make it for ever
ultra HD stick even though I've been
using it more recently I used it a lot
in the beginning of the year and I just
have so much makeup I'm always
constantly switching it up but this is
one of the best foundations I have ever
used I'm wearing it on my face right now
it looks amazing in photos it's great
for dry skin but it doesn't leave your
face too dewy it has like a perfect
finish literally like a perfect finish
it's just so good and so easy to apply
you just rub this all over your face and
you buff it in with a brush and it looks
for lovely it is a me
I also have to talk about this one and
this is probably going to be a huge
surprise to a lot of you but the Giorgio
Armani power fabric foundation is one of
my favorite foundations ever when I want
a super flawless full coverage look
that's going to last all night even
though I can totally get that with this
this one is just a little bit dewier and
a little bit more radiant this one is
pretty matte and sometimes if I'm gonna
be somewhere where I know I'm gonna be
sweating Miami's very hot
my makeups gonna be moving around a lot
I will 100% grab this foundation every
single time I've gone to Vegas I've
actually taken this foundation it just
lasts all night on my skin and it's
matte but it's like the most healthy
matte I doesn't cling on to any of my
dry patches it just is such a flawless
beautiful foundation I have nothing bad
to say about this except for the fact
that it's a trillion dollars it's so
expensive but I use it on special
occasions and stuff like that but I had
to mention it because I've used it all
year and it wouldn't be fair if I didn't
and from the drugstore these two guys
right here these take the cake this is
the number seven lift and luminate
foundation and even though it doesn't
look like I've used much I always use
this foundation as a mixer like a lot of
the times I will mix these two together
I will mix this with this I always mix
like a little bit of these with another
foundation it's my favorite mixing
foundation and I also love wearing it on
its own when I wonder my skin is very
very dry or when my skin is feeling
extra dehydrated this is the foundation
I will tend to go for at least in 2017 I
was really really into this foundation
and the Maybelline matte and poreless
foundation is like a staple for me that
this always looks good it's a foundation
I can totally rely on it has a nice
matte finish but it's a very natural
matte it's less matte than the power
fabric on me and I used it a lot this
past year so those are the foundations I
would say really stood out to me this
year or last year when you're watching
this video today's my best friend's
birthday
I haven't wrapped her birthday present
yet and she's gonna be here in a couple
hours I need to finish this video okay
for concealer I have to give it up to
the tart shape tape if this is a second
year winner I have yet to find a
concealer I love more than this one I
have used this time and time again I've
been using this same color for a long
long time I use this concealer almost
every single day it's completely full
coverage it covers up my dark circles I
have a lot of darkness right here and
like kind of like sunken in my eyes and
this covers that up really well and it
just looks flawless it never looks cakey
or think it just looks so beautiful I
love this concealer it barely creases
and I will probably be talking about
that concealer in my 2018 favorites
video as well but I have to give a major
shout out to the color pop no filter
concealer this one is in second place
for sure you cannot beat this concealer
for the price it is six dollars and it
is amazing the only downside to this
concealer is it does darken a little bit
in two to three minutes after you first
apply it you'll see that it does get a
little bit darker but that's nothing
that bothers me because once I put
powder and all that like it looks fine
it is a stunning concealer it looks so
flawless it also does increase that
badly and I actually love using this as
a foundation when I'm gonna rush I will
put this underneath my eyes and then put
a few dots around my entire face and
blend it in with a brush and it looks
beautiful this is like a beautiful
foundation yeah it just it's really
great really really really really really
great so when it came to powders last
year I mentioned the RCM a note color
powder this is still one of my favorite
powders 100% top 5 for the price you
cannot beat it it looks great in photos
I don't get any white cast with this it
just looks awesome and it's great for
baking it's just great for setting the
concealer on your eyes it's amazing but
this year I did want to mention two
other powders that I used so much and
one of them is the glossy a router I
have mine in the shade light/medium this
powder is so pretty it just sets your
concealer so flawlessly and it's like
undetectable on the skin I can put
pounds and pal
pounds of this powder on my face and I
can't see it looks beautiful and my
favorite thing about this is the
packaging I love that there's a like
mesh net right there and I love that
there's a stopper so you never have like
a messy situation here and the
application is just so easy you just dip
your little brush into this mesh the
powder comes up say your face boom and
it's done sometimes I don't reach for
loose powders all the time because of
the messy application and I don't get
that with this so it's literally the
best of both worlds I love this powder
so much and sometimes when I'm in a real
rush I don't have time to grab a loose
powder I really just grab a compact set
my face and I'm out the door and I have
been using this one so much like this
whole year I have just used this so much
this is the Wet n Wild the photo focused
pressed powder I'm in the shade warm
light this reminds me so much of the mac
mineralize skinfinish natural I used to
love that powder back in the day when I
first started my channel this has that
same finish but it doesn't irritate my
skin and it's so much more affordable
but it looks good underneath the eyes
and all over your face
if you're at the drugstore and you're
looking for a pressed powder you need
this one so while I was gathering all
the products for this video I realized I
am really set in my ways when it comes
to bronzer the three bronzers I
mentioned in my video last year are the
three bronzer that I'm going to mention
in this video all three of these are
two-time winners and honestly don't get
me wrong I have fallen in love with
other bronzers in 2017 for example the
Marc Jacobs fantastic bronzer was one of
my most used bronzers in the summer I
used this non-stop I would say this is
another favorite of mine this year for
sure but these three bronzers they're
definitely the ones I use the most for a
cream or liquid bronzer again the cover
FX custom enhancer drops and Sunkist is
the best liquid bronzer I have ever used
hands down it just blends the best you
can contour with it or bronze the skin
it just looks flawless and you can blend
out with a brush or a Beauty Blender it
is truly the best liquid bronzer contour
ever haven't even gone through half of
this and I
use this all the time so and they pricey
but they last a long time and then of
course I mean do I have to do I even
have to guys have seen me you spits in
like every video the physician's formula
butter bronzer is my favorite bronzer at
the drugstore hands down I just can
never stop using this one you know no
matter what look I'm doing a lot of the
times I will just grab this and contour
my cheeks a little bit with it I have
this as my contour today I love the
undertone in this this one is bronzer
Physicians Formula and now has four
butter bronzers but the original one
labelled bronzer is my favorite it
blends like a dream and it's I cannot
say enough for things you've heard me
rave about this but it is definitely
worth it you need it the other bronzer I
have to mention just for a second cuz
you've heard me talk about this this is
the Too Faced baked luminous glow
bronzer in the shade it's sweet tea this
is like their sweethearts bronzer this
is my favorite shimmery bronzer there
are times where I want a matte bronzer
and there are times where I want to glow
with my bronzer and this is the one I
always go to I love the two tones in
this I just mix it all around and I
applied to my faces also the other
bronzer I have on my skin and it just
makes me look so tan and bronzy I just
love it so much I don't love the
packaging I hate that I have to take
your top off because I lose everything
for me this year it was all about
drugstore blushes and I have two types
to talk about the first one is the
Milani powder blush in the shade warm
petals you might have not seen me use
this in videos a lot but I was always
wearing it in my videos a lot you know
like in the description box where I
always tell you what's on my face a lot
of the times I was wearing this blush
this year I don't like the fact that it
has little gold like sparkles in it but
when you tap your brush off and you
apply to the skin you don't really get
the gold flakes it's like a champagne
nude with a little bit of peach in it
and it looks so pretty on the cheeks
wore it a ton loved it but these bushes
these are my favorite blushes and I know
this is technically totally cheating
because I just discovered these at the
end of this year but I think this is my
favorite blush formula ever from the
drugstore like I'm not even joking these
are my favorite drugstore blushes I have
ever used
these are the Burt's Bees blushes and my
favorite for sure is toasted cinnamon
but before I bought this one I was using
a bear peach all the time these are so
incredible they have such a beautiful
formula because they're matte but they
have a very soft Sheen to them so when
you apply them to the cheeks
they don't look matte they look like
barely glowy but like there's something
there I don't know how to explain you
would just have to use these for
yourself hands-down my favorite blush
discovery in 2017 like out of all my
blushes toasted cinnamon ha it's my
favorite okay so I didn't want to
mention this product because it was
limited edition and I'm pretty sure you
can't get it anymore
but it is my favorite highlight of all
time listen to me guys this is my
favorite highlight I have ever ever ever
ever ever ever ever ever ever used in my
life and I always put off talking about
it or using it in videos I never use it
in my tutorials because you can't get it
anymore but a lot of the time if not
most of the time I'm wearing this on my
face what I'm just filming like talking
videos like now and that is the NARS
bonk disable or bank disable
highlighting palette specifically the
shade in the middle I have a huge debt
you can't even see but I have a huge
dent in to this in this color right here
I've used this highlight more than I
have used any highlight in my life I
think it's the highlight I'm wearing on
my face right now I don't know what it
is about this formula because it
definitely is the formula it looks wet
on the cheeks but it doesn't look like a
highlight in person I don't like chunky
highlights
I don't like glittery highlights or
those that look like girl girl you have
a lot of highlight on your face I don't
like that look this gives me such an
intense glow but it's just a sheen it's
a pure wet glow there's no sparkle like
nothing out of all my highlights in my
collection this is my favorite and that
is saying a lot and I'm so sad that this
was limited so sad about that and I
every time I use it I kick myself in the
butt for not buying a backup
really used it non-stop in 2017 and it's
the only highlight I'm gonna mention
today because it was hot top dog
I didn't want to mention tools like
brushes and stuff like that because this
video is already an hour long but I do
want to give a quick honorable mention
to these guys the the new Eco tools
brushes I recently discovered them as
well towards the end of the year but
they are incredible if you're at the
drugstore and you want good quality
brushes these are amazing they don't
shed on me and they're just so so soft
and I highly recommend them they're
amazing also this is dirty because I
used it but the flower Beauty sponge is
like my favorite sponge discovery in
2017 I use a Beauty Blender all the time
you know it's my favorite but it this is
like half the price and it's just as
soft just as squishy it is just as good
I was blown away by this sponge and I
think everyone needs to try the flower
Beauty sponge because you will not be
disappointed oh my god I forgot to
mention this when I was talking about
powders how could I not mention this the
Kat Von D blotting powder in the shade
light if you have very large pores and
you notice like after you put on your
foundation and you put on your powder
then your pores just like look really
large this is the powder you need it
doesn't claim to be a pore refining
powder but my pores disappear every time
I use this powder hit my little poorest
areas and it's like they're gone I love
it I use this powder all the time it's
100% a staple for me cannot get enough
of it remember when I said I wasn't
gonna mention another highlight I like
quick shout out to the colour-pop super
shock cheek in flexitarian this is kind
of like a mousse ii creamy highlight it
is so incredibly intense like this will
have you glowing to outer space it's
definitely not a wearable everyday
highlight it is really really intense
but if you want to shine bright like a
diamond this is the highlight for you
it's $6 you just apply it with your
fingers and it looks incredible so I
just have to mention that because I
think this is the best color pop super
shock cheek highlight that ever existed
I have so many setting sprays in my
collection
I love setting sprays and I
to say out of all the settings phrase I
own these two are my favorite the morphe
preppin set makeup setting spray this is
so convenient this is the easiest
setting spray known to mellitus it's a
continuous spray oh my gosh I'd love
this this is my favorite setting spray
ever the continuous spray just makes it
so easy to just get every angle of your
face and it has the most amazing fine
mist ever you never get giant water
droplets all over your face the mist is
very important to me and this this gives
it to me
this gives me the mist of my dreams it
takes away that powdery look and your
face just looks fresh and dewy and just
absolutely beautiful this is my third
bottle of this and I will continue to
repurchase at times time again but from
the drugstore and just in general this
is a great setting spray this is the
Milani make it last setting spray but
while I use the more if you want just
overall as a finishing mist like pretty
much after all my makeup routines I will
use this one a lot of the time to make
my makeup last all day the only thing is
a lot of you guys were telling me not to
use this anymore because alcohol is like
one of the main ingredients and now I
only use it for like special occasions
or when I'm going out and I really want
my makeup to last whenever I spray this
on my face my makeup goes from like zero
to 100 it looks beautiful it makes my
makeup look beautiful I don't know how
but it does oh right so we have tackled
all of the face products and now we are
moving on to eye stuff I really feel
like this was the year of color pop
eyeshadows he came out with pressed
powder shadows and they really just like
rocked the world with them they're so
good so inexpensive and really pigmented
and amazing I love the formula of color
pop shadows and they have so many
palettes they're a little bit smaller
than their single shadows but the 16
bucks and you get so many my most used
color pop eyeshadow palette besides
dream Street is the yesplease palette I
used this a ton when it first came out
and I also really like I think I love
you this is like the grunge neutral
girls dream full of Browns amazing so
besides color pop shadows I mean I also
used more fish a doze non-stop this is
the 3502 palette they have a 35o palette
that I really
but I love this one so much more I tried
to clean it up today before filming this
video because you should have seen what
this palette looked like on the inside I
had to clean like all the black parts
but the 3502 is amazing for you if you
love really really intense warm
eyeshadows this is for you this whole
thing is so inexpensive I know some
people don't like morphe but honestly
for the price you get such amazing
quality eyeshadows I just like this like
it's just it's just so incredible but I
also had to mention this one and this is
also gonna be a surprise to some of you
or to a lot of you but the Tarte
man-eater palette is a staple in my
collection they just recently launched a
new one the old maneater palette didn't
have a black eyeshadow now they
rereleased this palette with a black and
to me it is perfect now that is what
this palette was missing her regardless
I was using their other maneater palette
all the time in 2017 I highly recommend
it I use this all the time I actually
have a mixture of these two palettes on
my eyes today I mainly have dreams trade
all over my eyes that sparkle you see on
the lid is something else that I'll show
you in a little bit but I have this
combo on my eyes today and whenever I
travel no matter where I'm going it's
like these are the two pilots I take
like only these two palettes this is all
I need I feel like this was the year of
glittery shadows and not just any
glittery shadows a lazy girls dream of
glittery shadows have to say I'm on
board with this trend I cannot get
enough this is like one of my favorite
things that I have discovered in 2017
are just delicious
wet looking foiled glittery shadows last
year I gave major props to the heavy
metal glitter liners these are still the
best glitter liners I've ever used
I guess I'm mentioning them twice I
guess these are two-time winners as well
they actually finally came out with a
few new shades this one is grind and
this is punk rock they are just
incredible if you want a little sparkle
to the lid and they have zero fallout
these are amazing but if you're looking
for that foiled metallic wet glare look
to the entire lid the Stila magnificent
metals glitter and glow liquid
eyeshadows are where it's at these are
like a mixed
of a liquid eye shadow and a glitter
all-in-one because they do have a base
color
you're not just applying like the later
to the lid they do have like a look at
this color oh my god this one is called
molten midden I actually haven't used
this one on my lid look at that
so like the base of it is black but then
it has a ton of silver glitter all
throughout it and I love that about
these you just swipe them on your lid
and boom I just would recommend this
being your last step in your makeup
routine because if you start to blend
them out you will get some fallout so
just be careful with that and if you
want something almost identical for a
fraction of the cost I would highly
recommend the color pop supernova
shadows I would say this is my favorite
besides the eye shadow palettes because
I think that's amazing for color pop but
I think these are my favorite launches
from colour-pop in 2017 these supernova
shadows are insane this one is my
favorite this one's called moonlit let
me just show you how gorgeous they're
not as glittery I will say they're not
as glittery as the Stila ones but they
are like foil looking they're so
beautiful I mean they're incredible
they're insane and I bet they're gonna
release like a million new colors I'm
actually wearing walk of fame on my lids
right now that is the sparkle you see
out of all of them Walk of Fame is the
one that has the most sparkly glitter
enos to it and it's a little bit hard to
work with but it's actually one of my
favorite ones because it just looks so
glittery and beautiful on the lids I'm
pretty sure I mentioned this in my last
year's yearly favorite so I think this
is a two-time winner as well but the
Inglot Jo liner and number 77 is the
best liquid liner in the world best Jo
liner in the world this so fluid like
it's so black and on me it lasts all day
til I wash it off and it looks so mad
and so black like I cannot get enough of
this eyeliner it does dry out a little
bit quickly but I used the inglot
duraline which is like this little
dropper of liquid and you mix it right
in and it gets it nice and moist again
that's right I said moist so for
eyeliners last year I spoke about the
color pop eyeliners they're still my
favorite eyeliners
down because of the price I mean you
just cannot beat them they're very
creamy they go on like butter and they
last all day on my waterline seriously
cannot recommend these enough my
favorite one is mr. bean just saying but
from Sephora like high-end eyeliners I
have completely fallen in love with
these Marc Jacobs ones they recently
reformulated them they're the Highliner
matte gel crayons and I like the matte
matte ones way more than their shimmery
ones these are so intense
my favorite is fine wine this is the
most beautiful wine colored eyeliner
they're incredibly pigmented and they
last all day and you can just like
reapply over and over again and it never
gets weird in your waterline it's
they're just they're so good I think
personally they're worth the money and I
also wanted to mention the em cosmetics
illustrative eyeliner because I just
want to mention any cosmetics in general
I will talk about their infinite lip
clouds in my lip category but they're
matte gel pencil is really really great
I've been using this non-stop for like
the past few months I love this eyeliner
and then love and cosmetics for mascara
I feel like I used the L'Oreal
voluminous lashes all frickin year this
is hands down the best drugstore mascara
I have ever ever used it gives me so
much volume it's incredible and it never
looks like chunky I mean if you apply
too much it can get a little clumpy but
it looks like so feathery and amazing I
love this mascara I love the brown one
the black one I don't think it lasts as
long as my other ones I feel like in a
month it already dries out and my other
mascaras tend to last like about three
months but I will buy this every month
if I have to because I love the formula
of this and I love how it makes my
lashes look definitely my favorite
discovery in terms of mascara in 2017 ok
so we are almost done we only have lip
products to talk about and I don't have
that many lip product cuz I use my clubs
all the time if I'm gonna be completely
honest with you my most used lip product
in 2017 is my colour-pop ultra satin lip
liquid lipstick in point 0 not only is
this my most used like collab lip
product it's my most you
lit period in the year but since we're
not talking about clubs this video
because I mean honestly all my collapse
of various I used it non-stop the
Aquarius gloss I used a lot as well
besides those obvious colors these are
the lip products I use the most I want
to give a shout out to the only lip
liner I have to talk about today because
it is for sure 100% my most used lip
liner in 2017 this is the Mac Pro
Longwear lip pencil and etc I think this
is my second etc and I'm not almost done
but I'm like halfway through this lip
liner this is my favorite warm toned lip
liner it goes with every single nude I
cannot find an affordable dupe for this
like no other lip liner out there has
this undertone last this long it just
stays on my lips all day I mean it is
the pro long wear lip pencil so of
course but I love everything about this
lip liner the color the longevity it is
my most used for Shore like I mentioned
earlier this was a huge year for em
cosmetics and their infinite lip clouds
are incredible these are some of the
best liquid lipsticks I've ever used
they're not transfer proof or anything
like that but they are so comfortable
they really do feel like little okay
fireworks have already started and
Cornelius's terrified of fireworks let
me try this what I was saying these do
feel like little lip clouds they're so
comfortable but they do last all day and
I just love their color selection I love
the scent even though I don't like mint
there's something about mint chocolate
chip that I like even though I don't
like mint chocolate chips but like the
scent of it I really like another liquid
lipstick brand of course I've used
non-stop is Oprah
besides Miami fever in Havana nights
Manila has been my go-to nude from Oprah
South Paulo was my favorite until I
discovered Manila which is crazy because
South Paulo was like my life but I just
like that this one is a little bit
cooler this is the lip I'm wearing right
now it looks stunning with everything
and I highly recommend you check out
Manila besides Aquarius and will
now a moon child that I use all the time
besides those two glosses this was my
most used gloss in 2017 foreshore there
was a point where I was using this every
single day this is the bareMinerals
brilliant gloss and this is in the shade
groovy this is a very nude lip gloss
like it's a very pinky nude very very
light color but I love this formula I
don't know how to explain it cuz it's
not sticky but it has a really good grip
to it like when you apply it it stays on
your lips all day but it's not like that
weird sticky I don't know how to explain
it seriously like one of the best
glosses I've ever used you need to check
these out this is just I had to mention
