my 2017 skin care and hair care
favorites I asked you guys on Twitter if
you wanted to see this type of video and
a bunch of you guys said yes it was just
way too many products to include in my
Beauty yearly favorites like my makeup
favorites so I thought maybe we can do a
second video and just focus on skin care
and hair care because I had so many
standout products of the year and there
is so much talk about my entire floor is
full of stuff which is why I'm sitting
on my floor again by the way I have so
many things to share with you guys today
so many favorites and a lot of these are
gonna be surprises to you because I
mainly talk about makeup on my channel
not so much skin in here well not as
much so again I don't want this video to
be too long so I'm gonna try to breeze
through all these products so let's do
these so when it comes to removing my
makeup I have a few favorite things that
I love using I'm gonna start off with my
favorite wipes and I'm gonna breeze
through this because it's going to be no
surprise to you I have three standout
wipes of the Year decohesion Dole
cleansing spa water wipes are my
favorite wipes from Sephora
they are very pricey this is my
favorites like high-end makeup wipe
these wipes are extremely wet but not
sticky and not greasy they're just very
saturated with like I thought with the
water this fall water yeah it does such
an amazing job of removing all of my
makeup it gets everything off without
stinging my eyes and honestly feels like
I'm just rubbing water all over my face
and it's taking off on my makeup it's
seriously the best and my favorite from
the drugstore I don't currently have it
because I ran out of them and I haven't
repurchased it but the simple micellar
cleansing wipes they are my favorite
wipes from the drugstore they feel very
similar to the co Shindo ones they feel
like water on the skin they're perfect
for sensitive skin and I really really
love them I cannot recommend those
enough out of all the wipes at the
drugstore those are hands-down my
favorite and I also have to give an
honorable mention to these I've gone
through so many packs of this these are
the Murad clarifying wipes for blemish
prone skin I use these every once in a
while I mean I use them all the time
actually mainly when I feel my skin is
very clogged my pores are clogged I'm
having like bumpy skin and I'm having
issues I'll use these clarifying wipes
and they help so much I feel like with
these you either love them or you really
really hate them
my sister for example hates these she
says they burn her skin I never had that
reaction and I have pretty sensitive
skin and my skin is very dry I will say
though once you're done using this your
skin does feel a little tight but I kind
of like that because it doesn't feel
drying tight it just feels like tight
and tingly and I feel like it really
helps with breakouts and stuff like that
I personally freaking love these and
then when it comes to removing my makeup
without wipes I'll either use one of
these products if I have a full glam I'm
taking off all my makeup with this I
don't even bother with wipes if I have
falsies liquid liner if I have the whole
shipping
she'll be the center where I will use
this this is the Dermalogica pre cleanse
this is basically like a cleanse off oil
I use this at my sink right before I
wash my face I will squirt some of this
onto my fingers and really massage it
into the skin and it just melts away all
of my makeup with a breeze like it just
it melts the makeup right off no matter
what makeup you have on waterproof
makeup like the full shubee it takes it
off but when i have just like regular
makeup kind of like what i have on today
i will always use my Bioderma I've gone
through like 20 bottles of this it's my
favorite micellar water and I've tried
all of them I've tried all the ones from
the drugstore I just don't like any of
them as much as it like the Bioderma I
don't know what it is it doesn't sting
my eyes I can put it all up in my eye
and it doesn't hurt I just love how
gentle this is on the skin and it takes
off my makeup so easily it's amazing and
I use a cotton round but all over my
face and eye makeup is gone I love it my
favorite face wash has definitely become
the Vanna cream gentle facial cleanser
this is for sensitive skin I purchased
this at Target I will say really quickly
when it comes to skincare I really do
like to invest in my skincare some of
these are very pricey but they're things
they're really stand behind but for
example this is a very affordable face
wash and I got it at Target like I said
and I have completely stopped using all
my other fancy expensive face washes
because this just gets the job done it
doesn't remove makeup very well but I
don't use it as eye makeup remover I
just use it to wash my face and it
cleans my skin really nicely it's a dog
hair in my mouth it's like floating
everywhere
Faline it's very hydrating very
nourishing I love this so much guys know
I
had like a really bad skin issue I was
drinking like a lot of kombucha at one
point and it was like destroying my skin
I didn't know what it was I was having
major skin issues I had bumps all over
my forehead just it was bad and this
facial cleanser really helped with
reducing the redness and it really
helped how sensitive my skin was at the
time and I still keep using it it's
amazing and so affordable I really loved
it so I really want to mention this
because if there is a one product in
2017 that I discovered that completely
transformed my skin when I was having
those issues and continues to help my
skin till today is aloe vera very
affordable you can get aloe vera at your
local grocery stores this is a freaking
miracle plant I spoke about it in my how
I healed my skin video but this is
amazing I have a really big aloe vera
plant in my backyard and that's the aloe
vera I use this is the one I keep in my
room I love using that at night right
before bed I use it about two times a
week I won't put anything else on my
face I will wash my face rub aloe vera
all over my face and I have to say it's
not the most pleasant scent but it's so
effective it kind of like dries down and
it feels almost like a mask and when you
wake up in the morning I don't know my
skin just looks so much healthier so
much brighter my breakouts are extremely
minimized it just does wonders for my
skin that is my major winner of 2017 the
moisturizer I use every night before bed
is my drunk elephant la la retro whipped
cream this one is really great it's
great for my sensitive skin I like that
it's not a tub where I have to put my
fingers in you just like squish the top
and the product comes out
I like how hydrating it is on the skin
it's perfect for those of you who want
really great hydration but don't want
anything greasy
I feel like this sinks right into my
skin I love how it feels and it doesn't
get slippy or weird sometimes when I put
on night cream and I lay down on my
pillow it like gets on my pillow it's a
mess I really like this cream it's not a
mess and it just is very effective I
feel like it really nourishes and
hydrates my skin and I use it every
night but when I have something that has
broken me out for example if I tried on
a foundation that really irritates my
skin and I get like those bumps and that
redness all over my face this is the
moisturizer I will use this is the first
aid beauty ultra Repair Cream I don't
like that
a tub I think I'm gonna start buying the
small one because I'm pretty sure the
small one comes in a little squeezy tube
and I'll just continue to repurchase
that it is so great at really helping
the skin come back to normal it's very
calming it helps with my redness I just
really like how soothing this feels on
the skin I don't use it all the time I
only use it when my skin is very
irritated and red and I just I love it
for that oh I forgot to mention this
mine is so dirty the foreo this is such
a staple for me it is very pricey but in
my opinion I think it's really really
worth the money
I don't like the Clarisonic I've tried I
tried for months it just does not work
for my ultra sensitive skin even the
sensitive head just is not I don't like
it this is amazing I lost my charger so
I can't turn it on to show you but it
vibrates and it's perfect for those of
you who have sensitive skin but you
still want to deep clean your face and
you feel like your fingers are not
enough this is an amazing tool I have
the purple one I don't know the
difference between the colors but I got
I bought this one because it said it was
for sensitive skin and I feel like it is
amazing it really helps my skin feel
ultra clean without feeling drier I
tried a few eye creams this year that I
really like but no matter what I always
go back to my Kiehl's midnight recovery
eye this is my favorite eye cream I
recommend it to every single person who
asks me hey what's a good eye cream to
take away my dark circles and I'm like
this one I saw a difference in my under
eyes only like a woman only like a week
after using this I see results with this
which is why I really really love it it
helps with my darkness it helps with my
dryness I just love this eye cream okay
so now I want to talk about products I
don't use all the time but whenever I
need them they come through for me and
they really really work this is like
miracle liquid I don't know what's in
this but this is amazing this is the
essence and it's from tatcha and it's a
plumping skin softener with anti-aging
conflict I first when I got this I was
like what is this but it's a
concentration with nutrients that soften
the skin and keep it very hydrated and I
love it I don't use it every single day
but I use it like three times a week and
I only use very little I've only used
like this much and I've been using this
I feel like all year I use this right
before bed before I go in with my
moisturizer or any other skincare I'll
just take a little bit of this onto my
fingers and really press it into the
skin then I'll go in with moisturizer
and stuff and this helps with my dryness
this helps with my fine lines I noticed
my skin just does it looks more plump in
the morning it's witchcraft this is
amazing it's so expensive
all Bass's bins but 100% worth it in my
opinion
I used to exfoliate a lot in high school
like back in the day it was like I was
exfoliating like every single day but I
don't really exfoliate that much anymore
I would say I do it maybe like once or
twice a week and the exfoliator I have
been using since I got it in either a
boxycharm I think I got this in a box of
charm this is the dr. Brandt
microdermabrasion age defying exfoliator
for some reason I've just really been
into anti-aging things these days
because I turned 26 this month I really
enjoy this I feel like it is a little
bit rough but if you use a gentle hand
it takes off all the dead skin and your
face just feels amazing after you use
this I highly recommend it I know that
dr. Brandt has a blue one but that's
more of like a pore exfoliator I don't
feel like that one works on me as much
as the black one does and I just this is
the one that I've used the most in the
year I want to talk about two oils that
I really really love the first one is
marula oil period not drunk elephant
marula oil just marula oil I feel like
it really has made a difference in my
skin I used to use a different brand of
marula oil but ever since I got the
drunk elephant virgin marilla luxury
facial oil I just prefer this one I
don't know what it is about the drunk
elephant one that I love so much I don't
know what it is about marilla oil but
it's full of antioxidants and I feel
like it hydrates my skin while making it
look really nice at the same time out of
all the popular oils like jojoba oil
argan oil there's so many oils out there
I feel like marula suits my skin type
the best when my skin is the absolute
driest where it's like it feels really
tight and dry I always put the time
before I go to sleep and when I wake up
my face feels like a million bucks
and I wanted to give a shout out to this
guy because when I was having my skin
issues this really didn't help me and
I've continued to use it ever
but I use it on and off I don't use it
that often but this is the Sunday Riley
UFO ultra clarifying face oil it doesn't
look like I've even used that much but
this was completely full and to me
that's a lot because I literally only
use like two drops of this all over my
entire face this is to prevent acne and
to prevent blackheads it's kind of like
a salicylic acid treatment yeah it's and
salicylic acid medicated dry oil that
clears congested pores and it really
helps detoxify the skin and I feel like
this really does that I don't really use
mud masks anymore except I'm gonna put a
picture here the Ad Tech Indian healing
clay mask I had a whole tub and I have
no idea where I put it I don't know how
I misplace a whole tub of this but this
is the only mud mask I will use and it
is the most intense mud mask I've ever
used
totally switching gears here but I love
that mud mask it takes out everything on
my skin and it's drying but all I have
to do is put this on before bed when I
wake up the next day it's like new skin
but besides that I really like using
this when my skin is extra congested
I'll use it at night I'm going to wake
up I totally see a difference in my skin
speaking of congested crap on your face
whenever I have really large like
painful breakout usually around that
time of the month I will always pop this
little guy on I have loved this for
years if you remember me talking about
this on my channel you have been around
here for a long time this is the origins
super spot remover acne treatment gel
also with salicylic acid personally for
me salicylic acid really helps my skin
and all I will do you need
barely any product you just squeeze a
little bit of this onto your finger pop
it onto your pimple and when you wake up
the next day your pimple looks a lot
smaller it had it like completely dries
it out it like sucks the life out of the
pimple so when you wake up the next day
you're like oh my gosh it's almost gone
it's amazing I love that little guy okay
I have two face masks to talk about I
had three I already spoke about the
Aztec one out of all the face masks I
use this year these were the ones that I
felt like really made a difference and I
saw myself go back to time and time
again this is the TLC sukar II baby
facial from drunk
elephant this has 25% AAA and 2% VHA
this is very similar to the UFO oil kind
of in the sense that it really does
unclog your skin like congested Gaga's
skin this really does help with it but
this is like a mask but you put on and
then you take off like 20 minutes later
when I first use this I was like I'm
gonna have to use this a few more times
to see if I see a difference but I did
after a few uses I totally saw like how
plump and clean my skin looked after
using this it helps to find mines it
helps with your pores it's just a great
great facial you see a difference when
you use it over time I love it this guy
I have to give a little quick shout out
to because I've never mentioned this but
there are times I don't use this a lot
I really don't but there have been times
where my skin just looks so irritated
and so inflamed like for example if I do
a lot of makeup tutorials or if I'm just
been wearing a lot of makeup that week
my skin gets very irritated very fast I
have very sensitive skin and this really
came in handy a few times this is the
Ren ever come ultra comforting rescue
mask you just apply a generous amount of
this all over your face and you leave it
on for about 10 to 15 minutes then you
rinse it off and it instantly just calms
the skin this helps reduce redness it
helps just calm and relieve the skin so
I really like this mask oh I also wanted
to mention my little elf face mask
applicator I always use this to apply my
face mask it has like a silicone
applicator and it's so easy to clean so
I thought I would mention this because
it really is a skincare favorite of 2017
I use it all the time oh my god I feel
like this could have been a skincare
video all on its own holy crap okay two
more skincare products to talk about
these are lip products the first one is
the Laneige
lip sleeping mask it's like my go-to lip
mask right before bed I don't use
anything else and when I wake up in the
morning my lips are so plump and
hydrated and I know it's pricey for a
lip mask but Lynette has really great
ingredients their products are really
great and this is the best lip mask I
have ever used personally I love it I
love it and I think it's worth it and I
will repurchase it when I go through it
and then I wanted to give a quick shout
out to my bite Beauty agave lip balm
it's the one that comes like this they
have the agave lip mask that's in the
tube I like this even more than that one
this is like my go-to lip balm to put
underneath
any liquid lipstick there's like a stick
to this I don't know how to explain it
but when you apply it to your lips feels
like it's sticky and it's staying there
and it's really nourishing the lips and
it stays on your lips all day you have
like that constant hydration it doesn't
go away and it's the perfect base for
any lip product it's not greasy or
slippy it's freaking amazing
okay so now let's go on to my favorite
haircare products I need to breeze
through this because I actually have to
leave in 30 minutes I don't know it
seems like a long time but we'll see
okay shampoo I want to mention two
shampoos first one is not here I put a
picture up this is hands-down my most
used shampoo in 2017 the bumble and
bumble invisible oil shampoo is amazing
I've gone through I think two bottles
already it does a great job of really
really really cleaning my hair without
stripping it I feel like I really see a
difference whenever I use that shampoo I
have been using recently ever since I
ran out of that one and I have every
purchase that I've been using the
urology hydrate shampoo which is that
one I'm really loving as well so we'll
see what my favorite is next year but
the other shampoo I wanted to talk about
is from we dad is that how you say that
brand I hope so this is the ultra
nourishing cleansing oil that's really
great for curly hair if you are someone
who keeps your hair curly all the time
and you feel like a lot of shampoos kind
of strip your curls they mess with them
this is an amazing shampoo because it's
very very nourishing on your scalp
really nourishing for your curls but it
doesn't feel greasy or heavy or not like
oh my my hair is not clean no you still
feel like your hair is clean but it's
awesome for hydration and I always use
this shampoo when I want to leave my
hair naturally curly I always use this
shampoo I'm like completely done by the
way I need another one you guys know I
do not use conditioner I mean I don't
know if you know that I think I've
mentioned that a few times but I never
use conditioner on my hair anymore I
don't like to wash my hair everyday I
wash my hair maybe once or twice a week
I know that seem that seems gross but it
just I have very dry hair and since it's
chemically treated I don't like to wash
it as often so whenever I do wash my
hair I never use a conditioner I just
use a hair mask so my favorite favorite
favorite hair mask is no surprise to you
I'm not gonna talk about it so long this
is the Brio Gio don't despair repair
deep conditioning my
I love it because it's free of silicones
sulfates parabens it's a very natural
product but it hydrates the crap out of
your hair your hair feels extremely
silky and smooth and doesn't have any
silicone so it has like no filler I love
it and it treats the hair and really
gives it so much nourishment it's
incredible and I feel the exact same way
about the living proof restore masks
treatment for dry or damaged hair I feel
like this helps my hair I don't you know
what I don't know which one I like more
I want to say this one I just use this
one more often but I love them both
equally I love this hair mask it does
wonders for my dry hair like wonders oh
my gosh I completely forgot to mention
this in my shampoo category the Brio
gyeo scalp revival charcoal and coconut
oil micro exfoliating shampoo is my
favorite like exfoliating shampoo I use
a lot of products in my hair
mainly dry shampoo I put a lot of dry
shampoo on this head and sometimes it
leaves me with dandruff it creates
buildup and regular shampoo just doesn't
cut it I need something that's really
gonna exfoliate and get into my scalp
and just take everything out and I love
this brioche yield one because it has
coconut oil in it so it doesn't strip my
hair my scalp doesn't feel super tight
and gross like so many other exfoliating
shampoos or like cleansing shampoos have
done to me like I always used to hate
them this one is a godsend this is a
miracle and a tub I love this to really
remove all the gunk and all the gross
Ness out of my hair my favorite leave-in
conditioner is this one this is also no
surprise to you I feel like this is a
second year winner for me this is the
pre ojio rose Arkell milk reparative
leave-in conditioning spray Rio Gio
doesn't have any crappy chemicals in it
no harsh ingredients this is free of
sulfates silicones parabens and this
just makes my hair feel so smooth and
every time I get out of the shower after
I wash my hair like no matter what my
hair just feels a little bit drier and
whenever I put this in my hair it like
transformed I just love it it's so great
oh my gosh this has been my favorite
hair discovery in a very very long time
I've spoken about this on my channel
months ago and I
haven't even used that much I'm down to
here but I use this every single time I
wash my hair granted I don't wash my
hair every day but I use very little of
this I put just like a pea-sized amount
onto the palm of my hand and I just
really work this from like my ears down
oh did I tell you what this is this is
from the brand marula and it is the
intensive hair treatment and styling oil
it's silicone free color safe it tames
frizz and repairs strands for coarse
curly earth thick hair I have very fine
hair and I feel like this works for me
and this makes my hair look so silky and
it makes it feel so silky smooth
hands-down the best hair oil I have ever
used in my entire life I know that seems
very dramatic but like I feel like I
really found my ultimate hair oil this
is such a winner for me it adds so much
shine it's mmm I love it I cannot
recommend this enough ok so as you guys
know most of the time I keep my hair
pretty straight but whenever I leave my
hair naturally curly these are the
products I use I mainly use the Brio Gio
curl charisma rice amino and quinoa
frizz control gel if I'm gonna use a gel
I'll usually use a gel or a mousse
sometimes both this is my favorite gel
no harsh ingredients it just leaves my
hair looking nice and shiny and bouncy
like it really does a great job of
keeping my curls bouncy and soft without
being sticky or greasy you know how many
gels leave your hair feeling so sticky
and gross I love this Jo it's amazing
perfect for my curly hair really keeps
the curls in place whenever I use a
mousse this is my go-to mousse you can
get this at the drugstore it's so
affordable this is the L'Oreal air dry
it ruffed body mousse this is the
stronghold for waves and curls it's also
frizz resistant I totally agree with
that I really love how this makes my
curls look they look nice and bouncy and
it doesn't give me a crunch even though
it is a stronghold it's a great mousse
but the best thing about this mousse is
the scent I want to perfume in this
freaking scent it's so good
I will repurchase it time and time again
for the scent alone I'm so glad I like
the formula as well because it I get the
best of both worlds I freaking love this
mousse no matter what you're doing to
your hair even if you're just
blow-drying it I
I recommend using a heat protectant it's
really gonna pay off in the long run
my favorite heat protectant in 2017 was
the living proof restore instant
protection weightless heat and newley
protection so it also protects you from
the Sun I love this I feel like I
started using this more towards the end
of the year but I love how easy it is
you just spray it I feel like it makes
my hair shiny while really protecting it
from the heat I used to use the ones
that you had to like spray rub it in
your hand and put it in but this is just
so much easier to use and I feel like it
is very effective as well so I'm lazy
and I like to go the easy route so a
spray-on heat protectant is the way to
go and I like the spray on this it's
like a continuous spray it's R it's just
so easy it's so good I also really like
the scent it smells very good do I have
to talk about this
do I have to this is definitely a second
year winner I don't I didn't do this
video last year but if I did this would
would have totally made the case is the
Elizabeth and James Nirvana black dry
shampoo they have a few different ones
the black one is the only one I like
because it's the only scent I like I'm
not really into any of the other Nirvana
cents this is a very pricy dry shampoo
but honestly it's the best in my opinion
I have tried to soul so many and there
are a ton I like for example if you want
a really affordable one from the
drugstore the batiste dry shampoo is
really really good but this one just
works the best for my hair I don't use
dry shampoo to give myself volume I use
it strictly to take away the oil is the
dirtiness of my head and this just takes
away all my oil it looks like I just
freshly washed my hair while making it
smell good it is my favorite hands down
the best dry shampoo I have ever ever
used speaking of your hair smelling good
I really wanted to mention this because
I use this all the time ever since I
discovered it in 2017 this is the toka
hair fragrance but this one is Julieta I
used to use the Stella one all the time
and I really liked that one but when I
discovered this one this is the best one
out of all of them it really stays in
your hair and it makes your hair smell
really nice but it doesn't it doesn't
like clash with your other perfumes this
is a very fresh everyday clean scent it
smells almost like your hair is supposed
to smell like this naturally so fresh
and clean and I feel like even if I'm
wearing a super intense perfume it
doesn't clash with it yet
I go like this I can smell it in my hair
and my hair just smells so good if
you're someone who doesn't wash your
hair every day but you want your hair to
smell great pickup tow college you let
that because it is so awesome and you
don't really need that much just a spray
or two and it's just it's so good okay
we are almost done I have two more
products to share with you and they're
more tulle products I really want to
give a huge shout-out to my wet brush
this is the best brush I've ever used
the best brush I've ever discovered and
my appreciation for this brush has grown
in the past week because I just recently
purchased that ridiculous Mason Pearson
brush that everybody talks about I
cannot believe I spent that much on a
hair brush everybody was saying it was
the best hair brush ever and I don't
even like it it makes my hair really
frizzy I don't know but the wet brush is
literally pennies compared to that brush
and it is better in my opinion I know
everybody raves about that brush but
this is so affordable and it gets the
job done I could use it in the shower
when my hair is wet or when my hair is
dry and it detangles my hair without
pulling my hair the wet brush is the
best brush especially if you detangle
your hair in the shower like I do yes
best brush ever and then I wanted to
give an honorable mention to this this
is the GHD heard creative curl wand I
just recently purchased this is kind of
cheating I'm only hiding for like a
couple months but I freaking love this
curl wand I love the shape of it as you
can see it's not just like a round
barrel it almost has like this paddle
shape and I love how that makes my curls
look I have it in my hair but I only did
it like barely anything just to give
myself a little bit of something and I
love it I feel like it does hold a curl
and I just love how it makes the curls
look it doesn't look like Shirley Temple
curls they look like beach waves this is
my favorite like wand I've ever ever
purchased it's very very pricey GHD is a
very pricey brand but this is something
I think is totally worth it for example
I just recently purchased the GHD
platinum professional like flat iron
that's like 250 bucks and I don't even
like it I'm so sad I know it has 5 stars
and was highly recommended to me but I
have very frizzy hair and I don't think
that that flat iron makes my hair as
straight as my Chi
makes it to me my Chi is like it's my
ride-or-die but I lost my Chi and they
don't make them like they used to
anymore I had that Chi for so many years
and I lost it how do you lose a flat
iron in the house I don't know but I did
and now I'm on the hunt for the next
best thing and honestly the GHD just
didn't do it for me and the baby list
burns the shiz out of my hair I will not
use that one oh my gosh I'm going off on
a tangent but this GHD curling wand is
so worth the money if you want those
beautiful beachy waves ah you need this
it's so good but anyway guys that
