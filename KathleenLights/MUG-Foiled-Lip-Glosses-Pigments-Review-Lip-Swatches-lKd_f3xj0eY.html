lip swatch video and an arm swatch video
makeup geek has released some new
products Marlena came out with the
foiled lip glosses and she also came out
with the foiled pigments there are 10
lip glosses and 12 pigments it's a brand
new giant foil collection and I'm going
to be sharing all of them with you today
I will be showing you watches of the
pigments on my hand and then I will be
showing you swatches of the lip glosses
on my lips of course and please excuse
me because I am sick I woke up today
with a horrible sore throat and
extremely stuffy but I knew that if I
didn't get a video pin it you guys would
kill me so I wanted to do a more
laid-back relaxed videos like in my
sweater and I thought this would be the
perfect video to give you guys today the
full of lip glosses retail for $15 each
which isn't super affordable but I don't
think it's extremely pricey either
I feel like makeup geek has established
that they're kind of like a middle
ground brand
I think the prices are pretty reasonable
or single shadows are $6 her foil
shadows are $10 and I agree that they
should be $10 because they're insane I
know that when makeup geek first
launched they were an extremely
affordable brand but I think Marlena has
addressed it on social media so yes
these are $15 and then the foiled
pigments are $12 so it's only two
dollars more than the eyeshadows and I
believe you get more product in the
pigments I don't remember the last time
I ever went through a pigment so these
will last you a very long time
she didn't update the packaging last
time she released some pigments a lot of
people were saying that they were
cracking and they were spilling I even
have a couple of them that are cracked
none of mine spilled but some of my
little cubbies are correct but she did
update the packaging made it better and
inside you get this like tiny little
hole here so it's not spilling
everywhere it has this little stopper
that's very very handy these are now
available already on the makeup geek
website and I'm going to get into the
swatches first I'm going to show you the
lip swatches and then I'm going to give
you my reviews and my thoughts on these
for lip glosses and then we will jump
into these swatches of the pigments and
then I will give you my thoughts and my
reviews on the pigments so yes if you
want to see all of these lip gloss on my
lips and if you want to know my stuff on
the lip glosses
keep walking
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
okay so as you saw from the swatches
these lip glosses are not for the faint
of heart they're very very foiled I have
things I really like about these but
then I have things I don't really like
so much my favorite color out of all of
them is VIP it's the lightest shade in
the whole collection but I also truly
love love acoustic a lot I would say
acoustic and VIP are my top two picks
these are the ones that I'll probably
end up using the most because if I'm
going to be completely honest a few of
these I really don't see myself wearing
different in setlist is really nice too
as kind of like a topper on top of
another lipstick I think this would look
really nice but shades like these too
they're a little bit too 80s for me I
don't really like colors like this I
wish she would have come out with more
neutral shades I know that their soils
and their intent and their metallic but
I would have liked some foiled like
golds and browns and that kind of thing
this one in the shade vinyl is extremely
unwearable but I find it to be really
cool I actually like this one a lot
maybe it would give a really cool twist
to a certain makeup look this would be
really cool to just like place in the
center of another lipstick as well okay
so let's talk packaging I'm obsessed
with this packaging I think it's my
favorite lip packaging she's come out
with she recently came out with lip
sticks and other lip stuff she's like
going lips crazy and I love this
packaging I think it's so sleek I love
all the top fades from like a dark
purple to like a hombre glitter I think
the packaging is really awesome for me I
realized these are really cool at first
they did kind of settle me off because
when I was watching them on the back of
my hand when I first got them they were
almost impossible to remove they like
slip and slide everywhere not in the
texture that's like slippy in like a
sticky way and I for sure saw like oh my
gosh these are going to be so sticky and
they're gonna be goopy and they're going
to be gross but when I put them on my
lips I felt differently about them I
wore this color yesterday for a few
hours I'm going to say like three hours
I didn't wear them for that long but it
did not move in the three hours that it
was on my lips they do have a thick
consistency to them they feel almost
tacky to the touch but when they're on
your lips they don't feel goopy or like
glossy and thick and gross but
fact that they are tacky it does help
the lipgloss stay on for a lot longer
this did not phase so I have a feeling
user extremely long wearing but keep in
mind if you're not into that tacky
texture you won't like these I would say
all of them the majority of them have
like a really cool oil in metallic look
to the lips the only one that has like
glitter Amy at least a significant
amount of glitter in is the sheen
acoustic I don't know what it is about
this one but I find it to be extremely
wearable if you like a dark lip dark
lips aren't exactly wearable but if
you're into a really dark lip I don't
find this to be overly foiled I feel
like the glitter I don't know I feel
like it looks pretty wearable on the lip
and it's dark enough and it doesn't look
like too reflective these also don't
really have a scent but then again my
nose is stuffy so I'm sorry it can't
really tell but from what I remember
yesterday they don't really have much of
a scent smell like a lipstick like what
you would normally think a lipstick
smells like that's what this smells like
it doesn't have like a vanilla scent or
a peppermint scent or anything like that
it just smells like lipstick so yeah I
mean there really isn't much else to say
about them if you're into a soiled
lipgloss and these are for you
personally they're not my absolute
favorite I just don't find them to be
extremely wearable I will get a lot of
use out of VIP and acoustic though
because I love those I also think vinyl
is really cool you know I think a really
great way to wear these to make them a
little bit more wearable is to put on
like a lipstick and then apply this to
the center and then kind of move around
with your fingers and that way you get
like the foiled look right in the center
I also really like head liner by the way
I forgot to mention that head liner
would look so beautiful on top of really
dark brown lipstick yeah I know the
metallic liquid lipstick right now is
super on-trend and this is her like lip
gloss version of them I like that
they're lip glosses and not a typical
foil liquid lipstick but at the end of
the day I'm not huge on the foiled lips
trend but that's just me I know people
will crazy over them oh yeah those are
my thoughts I hope that they were
helpful now I'm going to get into the
foiled pigments if you want to see
swatches and my thoughts on the foil
pigments then let's get on with that
I
you
okay so as you saw these are amazing
they're really incredible I love all of
these there isn't a color I really don't
like some of them are less foiled than
others like some of them i swatched and
I was like whoa that's amazing some of
them felt like just regular segments you
know regular segments which I love
pigments I feel you get so much
pigmentation when pigments that they're
amazing I really don't use pigments that
often because for me it's just easier to
dip my brush into an eyeshadow palette
or like a press I shadow than it is to
go into my drawer and look for pigments
but I'm lazy I want to play around with
these little marks all I've done is
squash them I haven't really worn them
on my eyes I am so into the shade
gargoyle right here I think this is the
one that impressed me the most which is
really strange because I don't typically
go for these like 2p cooler tone chase
but gargoyle is stunning there's like a
dirtiness to it it makes it a little bit
less silver and I don't know I love
gargoyle I also really love boo doo
which is like the dark green feel like
that one is so unique I love it I like
that she updated the packaging I like
the little stopper there really isn't
anything negative for me to say about
the pigments right now lip gloss is not
my absolute favorite but these twelve
pigments are like winners for me let me
know what you think about these new
products down below have you tried any
of them are you going to let me know
your thoughts and then I complete this
video thank you guys so much for
