exciting one I've never done a video
like this on my channel before but we
are gonna be letting my dogs pick my
makeup I'm sure you guys have seen these
kinds of videos going around YouTube
recently like my dog picks my makeup
Google picks my makeup my cat picks my
makeup my subscribers pick my makeup my
fish picks my makeup my neighbour picks
my makeup and you you've seen I know
you've seen them and honestly I don't
exactly know who started this whole
video I got inspired by Jay kissa I saw
she did my pitbull picks my makeup and
it was so cute so I really wanted to do
it so I will tag Jay kisses down below
and whoever started this tag if you guys
know who started this whole thing it was
the first person I don't know just let
me know
and then I will tag them below so
basically if you've never seen videos
like this I just set up a bunch of
products in categories like foundation
concealer primer bronzer all of that I
laid a few out on the floor and then I
had my dogs pick one it was mainly
Cornelius I'm not gonna lie he was
basically the only one participating in
this so I figured whichever one they
pointed to whichever one they sat on
looked at sniff but you ever one felt
like it was being picked is what I'm
using on my face today so we have a full
face of makeup picked by mainly
Cornelius sprinkled with a little bit of
saline in there anyway I'm really
interested to see how this look turns
out so if you want to see my dogs pick
my makeup and then watch me apply the
makeup then well let's get started okay
here we go okay I need you guys to pick
something hey Cornelius I'm gonna need
you guys to pick some Cornelius okay I'm
gonna give him a second okay one of
these come on Oh what should you want
come on twins what'd you do what doing
these oh okay I'm gonna say she picked
this one right she totally landed on
that one yeah we've been here for 25
minutes so I'm gonna say yeah I just
laid some random primers on the floor so
she picked this bougie YSL primer
alright now I have foundations these are
just random foundations ooh someone woke
up good morning you wanna play with us
guys you guys just don't get it it's
lean you wanna come pick the foundation
you want claw means come on all we need
go pick one pick points
mm why is it that everybody else's dog
can do this oh are you pointing did you
guys see her point saw her point at this
and we're just gonna go with that
because like I said this is a lot harder
than I thought it was we've got some
concealers Bobby
pick one Oh oh my gosh she smelled both
of them I don't know I'm gonna say this
one because this is the one that he
sniffed second and he licked it which is
confirmation that was him saying yes
that one all right I put down some new
powders I've been testing out while a
new ish this one's not very new but the
rest are new ish oh my gosh this is a
piece of my equal tools beauty blender
by my mom's dog ate yes it is come on
come on you're almost there okay the one
he moves first that's right I'm gonna
use the Marc Jacobs invisible finish
line powder actually didn't really like
this the first time I use this it made
me like so mad but we'll use it again
alright we have this bronzer selection
Cornelius oh alright thank you so much
he has chosen the color pop bronzer in
private party thank you for being the
best participant today
okay Cornelius take a peek which one
smells good
all right Chris you can do this we've
been at this for like 15 minutes come on
just pick a blush any blush huh huh I'll
take it I'll take it this is the makeup
geek spellbound blush all right we got a
selection of highlights here folks oh
damn that was easy Cornelius those fast
NARS thought de France okay so here I
have poor palette that I just recently
got and I haven't played around with
them so let's see which one they pick Oh
you you you sniffed that one right
that was you picking that one right no
I mean you keep smelling that one are
you guys just picking the ones that are
on the corners here on the edges are you
guys getting lazy do you not want to
walk further in but I guess fine yeah
just put your nose drool all over it
this is the huda beauty choral
obsessions eyeshadow palette all right
now we got my ill Porter No
you know we got mascaras oh my god I
have at least these dogs in America any
one of these any one oh oh I'm debating
whether or not he picked this one or
this one so I'm like totally just gonna
layer them now I have a few different
lip options I have a few nudes a few
colors or red all that good stuff let's
see what they pick come in Cornelius my
only my only good dog oh I don't know
because he sniffed Reb but he also
sniffed this one first
like it was a combo of both I guess I'm
just gonna have to mix these maybe do
like a light layer of this and then this
one on top because he did touch the
gloss first but I feel like it was for
such a short second and then he was like
lingered on this so I'm just gonna mix
them regardless of what they're gonna
look like but we'll see okay so this
should be interesting
I've already primed my eyelids with my
pee Louise make a base this is the
palette they chose I just recently
purchased it I've been so excited to try
it out because I just love these types
of colors like these are my kind of
colors you know so I'm probably gonna do
a really basic look that I've done about
a million times but you know that's not
the point of this video it's not a
how-to tutorial you know like it's just
Cornelia stinging my makeup okay so I'm
first gonna go into this color right
here I'm gonna use that as my transition
I don't want this video to be like an
entire full-blown look because honestly
I'm not doing anything today I think I'm
not going anywhere
ah sorry of my life but I just want a
little bit of something-something on the
ice I don't know if you guys have seen
my meat my dog's video if you guys
didn't know I have two your keys and a
Celine Celine is my little mutt I'm a
little mixed dog I actually got her from
the Humane Society she's a rescue but I
got her in Mississippi like when I lived
there and she is like the best thing
that ever happened to us I love her so
much and I honestly have to that
experience like I will never buy a dog
again I mean I bought Cornelia's when I
was 15 years old I bought him with all
the money I got from my 15s because I
didn't really know any better I didn't
know anything about the Humane Society
and of all that so I didn't adopt a dog
I just bought him and then Porter wasn't
oops I found Cornelius and my dad's dog
connected and that's how we got poured
but honestly I don't know where I would
be without my dogs they are the best
thing ever if you have stress anxiety if
you suffer from anything like that
honestly I don't know how I would
function without my dogs because
whenever I feel really really sad my
anxiety is through the roof whenever I'm
feeling just like a the worst being
around my dogs
honestly just puts me in a much better
mood honestly I don't know what I'm
doing to the eyes right now I just knew
I wanted to use this yellow on my entire
life next up I'm gonna use this color a
little bit more precisely not as crazy
okay so I want a little bit more than
that I'm gonna take this pink right here
and I'm gonna do the exact same thing
the one thing I will say about this
palette that I find a little bit strange
like don't you think these two colors
probably too similar to be in the same
eyeshadow palette I'm not really into
that gnarly and in fact I'm just gonna
take that other pink and do the do the
same thing I think this other pink is
just a little bit more intense like a
little deeper the other one is just a
little softer but still like they're so
similar I'm gonna use my finger to apply
this shimmer shade all over the lid this
is the kind of eyeshadow that would look
so amazing when you wet it and I might
do that but at the very end which even
without like water or a setting spray or
without wetting it this eyeshadow is
still really nice so you get the most
color payoff when you apply it with your
finger and you really press it in then
I'm going to take this hot pink right
here I'm gonna use this color it won't
use this on my outer corners and I'm
gonna drag it into the crease as well
now I'm gonna go into the brown right
here I'm gonna do the same thing
I'm gonna go back into the yellow and
I'm gonna intensify that yellow in my
crease okay this may be a super
unpopular opinion about this palette
because I've heard nothing but good
things but I don't I don't think if
anything special there's something about
this palette like I can't put my finger
on it there's something that I'm not
crazy about you know I'm gonna take that
shimmery I shall only I'm using it wet
this time really quickly I'm gonna clean
up all this fallout so we can start on
the face so for primer Selene picked the
YSL Touche Eclat burglar number blur
primer that I think is overpriced I
really don't see much of a difference
with this guy I mean it's nice but I
don't know if it's like a trillion
dollars nice you know what I mean kind
of feel like there's a lot of other
brands at Sephora that have similar
primers that work better and then that
aren't I said to that guy I don't like
the scent on this so they also got
pretty bougie for a foundation as well
power fabric long wear high coverage
foundation from Giorgio Armani I
actually love this foundation it's one
of my favorites I think this might be
too 10 for me even though I was at the
pool this past weekend and I got a bit
of a tan so this might be my perfect
color oh actually this is in the shade
4.5 oh wait no yeah this is always my
perfect color actually it's like it's
kind of looking a little fair right now
when I'm Tana used the shade at 6 this
is my go-to foundation whenever I want
to go out to an event and I need my
foundation on all night and it's gonna
look good in pictures like I always wear
this I never really wear it on camera
but man I wear this off camera all the
time
well all the time when I'm gonna go
places which is not all the time at all
okay couldn't see there is
the Milani retouch and erase light
lifting concealer actually really really
like this concealer I think the
packaging freakin sucks but I love the
concealer it's just like this whole
squeezy tube
situation with this weird sponge
multiple me not for me I have this song
stuck in my head from the movie rounders
have you ever seen that movie it's a
really old movie with Matt Damon it's
about poker but where Norton is in it
and I saw it last night with Danny and
the song that comes out in the credits
has been playing in my mind all day
they say in order to get a song out of
your head you have to listen to the song
add a little bit of this on my nose okay
so the powder that was picked was the
Marc Jacobs invisible finish line powder
the last time I used this I really liked
how it looked initially like right off
the bat but I feel like as the day went
on and made my under eyes look really
dry because it was just so freakin matte
on my dry skin so I mean we shall see it
does look really smooth though like I
like how it applies I would just say
it's better suited for those of you with
oily skin normal to oily skin for
bronzer Cornelius picked to the
colour-pop private-party bronzer
actually really liked this bronzer a lot
I'm gonna use my little equal tools
precision powder brush okay so the blush
that was picked is not exactly a blush I
would pair with this look I would go
with something more nude or more peachy
creaminess pigments which I like it's
just freaking pink compared to all the
peachy warm yellow Venus we have going
on in the eyes so all the best choice
Cornelius but it'll do
you know what blush this will look
really good with toasted cinnamon bear
peach anyone ok the highlight that was
chosen was the NARS affordable hair
fort-de-france highlight I love this
highlight I'm actually using an
eyeshadow brush to apply this this is
from storybook cosmetics it's like one
of their flower brushes
okay now we can finish up the eyes for
the lower lashline basically all I'm
doing is I'm going to take this color
and I'm going to drag it really closely
to my lower lashline and then I'm gonna
buff it out with the yellow so because
this palette doesn't really have a
highlight shade I'm gonna use that same
highlighter we used on my face you know
I'm just gonna pop that on the inner
corner for mascara I didn't know which
one to choose so I'm just gonna layer
both of them oh and first I'm gonna go
in with my Kiko extra sculpt Volume
Mascara
alright let's see how these mascaras
layer ok we are almost done with this
look actually really like how it turned
out I love these eyes for the lips a
little bit concerned this one was the
first thing Cornelius picked I know it
was like he like sniffed it and he
lingered over it but then he lingered
over this one a little bit more so I'm
gonna pop this on and then I'm gonna put
this on top this is Clint from
colour-pop it's their ultra satin lip
and you know what I'm gonna apply this
with a brush so I can get a softer
application going on top of that is the
Marc Jacobs enamoured lip gloss in pink
steam
not bad you can't even see the purple so
it just looks like a glossy lip but
anyway guys that completes this video
this was a full face using makeup my
dogs picked out I think that Cornelius
has some pretty good taste I wouldn't
have paired this blush with this look
but I think it turned out pretty good
yeah let me know if you guys enjoyed
this type of video would you guys like
to see more challenge type of videos in
the future like stuff like this I don't
know

some high-end makeup man NARS YSL

wrong with you guys what do you think

was picked this is the north north for
NARS from for highlight my boobie pick a
